    <strong>YOU Have To Set An Example For Others</strong>
    <p><p>I had never worn a mask until I started a new job in October. My justification for going along with it <strong><em>while at work</em></strong> was, "Most people are slaves to their 9-5 job anyways, so I'm just agreeing to their terms &amp; conditions". </p>
<p>What I've done since working there is find creative ways that allow me to justify working without it on during certain tasks. </p>
<p>In the last few months, more and more of my colleagues have begun to follow suit. I felt like a gimp putting it on at work but I'm glad I was able to set an example. Same as with going to stores, <strong><em>be someone all those masked simps aspire to be. You never know, you might just be the catalyst they needed.</em></strong></p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I live in a state without mandates but Target, Walmart, etc. still "require" and yet most everyone wears them in those stores except for a small handful of us.  I have only once been talked to by a mask nazi employee and I did put one on as to not make a scene but promptly took it off as soon as I turned the corner.</p>

        <p>I lost most of my family to the real Nazi's. Please don't use that term for something this minor. Wait till your grandmother has watched Nazi's kick her baby to death in front of her while laughing at her screams. Or made your 8-year year old uncle live on dog shit till he died of it in Auschwitz. Try waking up as a 5 year old every night to the nightmare screams of your geandmother. Try asking an old aunt what she did in the French resistance and see her run from the room shaking and crying. There are plenty of other strong terms before you jump to the purest evil ever known.</p>

        <p>While I do feel bad for what happened to your family you have to know I wasn't compairing her to a nazi.  I meant it like The Soup Nazi from Seinfeld or Grammar Nazi.</p>

        <p>Nobody really is themselves at work. That being said I had an experience in Costco today while shopping with family where my mask was not worn perfectly (fell below my nose) and an employee who I swear when looking back is probably there as Cuck Patrol told me to fix my mask. He was polite but I was still a little annoyed. I was walking in an area with few if any people around yet buddy felt like piping up . </p>
<p>If I was some big 6 ft 3 tradesman he wouldn’t probably done so.</p>

        <p>I was doing some travelling recently and wore my mask below my nose the entire trip. The only reason I even wore it is because the airport and the state I was in was strict. I only had one person comment on it to me lol. I really would not have worn it except for the fact I was on family vacation and didnt want to trouble my family. A surprising number of people are just done with the nonsense. I haven't worn a mask after the first 2 months in Texas and no one says anything. It's crazy how people think a scary plague is wreaking havoc yet we all live lives as normal aside from a useless piece of cloth and TV telling us otherwise. Nothing has changed aside from the general population now being germaphobes.</p>

        <p>I’ve never worn one a single time. I have worn a full ass gas mask in mockery at an Urban Outfitters once. And to troll maskers in the grocery store. But I made sure it was obviously satire. Wouldn’t want to be confused with a giant retard.</p>

        <p>Yes we do!!!</p>
<p>I was in fresh thyme today and went the whole store with no mask. </p>
<p>Only in line did an employee ask to out my mask up. It was near closing time and i nearly asked everyone, "why are we doing this?" It felt right to do and in line with the spirit of the environment at the time. </p>
<p>People im masks chatted me up and even other employees too. </p>
<p>I read a quote today, it said, "liberties aren't given they are taken." Think it was Thomas Jefferson. So many people are avoiding confrontation. So many people! If not us who, if not now never.</p>

        <p>I applaud anyone not wearing a mask, all the more so as it's not enough of a deal-breaker for me to anticipate getting hassled each time I walk into a store. That said, vaccine is where I personally draw the line, and anyone abstaining from masking to do the latter strikes me as jumping from the frying pan into the fire</p>

        <p>Agreed. I set the example wherever I can. And try to set a positive one too. Of a maskless happy and polite person. I don't get rude with employees eho are unfortunately just doing their jobs. I literally just act normally and most of the time it goes great.</p>
