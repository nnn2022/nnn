    <strong>South Florida doing poor job of raising vaccine enthusiasm</strong>
    <p><p>This article from Palm Beach Florida speaks of how they are shutting down mass vaccination sites because customers have stopped showing up.  In one location they had 16,000 doses and over 10,000 people failed to show up.  And its blacks and hispanics that are most vaccine-wary, not white Republicans like the majority of the MainStream Media has been trumpeting.  </p>

        <p>Good. The more people don’t get it, the better.</p>
<p>Whoever’s still scared of the ronus has more appointments to choose from. So hopefully they can get their shots, shut the fuck up and leave the rest of us the FUCK alone. Which is all we ever wanted in the first place.</p>

        <p>I have a feeling that whoever was going to get it, has gotten it. They are going to spend a lot of money on ads to get others to take it. When that doesn’t work, they are going to crank up the fear porn again. Maybe even put the death ticker back up on the CNN screen.</p>

        <p>It just goes to show how much they have violated the Trust of americans.  That people are even willing to face Death rather than trust this government.  </p>
<p>But even worse is Sillicon Valley with their tech censors.  We are not even permitted to properly research the vaccine on a search engine like Google because they have scrubbed and deleted 90% of the opposing views.  So that was the main reason that I DONT TRUST THEM.  </p>
<p>Because they are concealing and censoring any opposing voice including from doctors, nurses and others in the field.</p>

        <p>1 million percent. That is what is insane to me. People that shame the skeptics, how can not even one eyebrow be raised at the way they have censored any opposing views. I was on the other side of this argument at the beginning. But you can only ignore so many coincidences until it becomes glaringly obvious to anyone that pays any critical mind to the matter.</p>

        <p>Censorship is a really big problem.  It makes it very hard to do independent research and to view 2 sides of a debate and make a final choice.  </p>
<p>Imagine a criminal trial where the jury is not allowed to view 80% of the evidence at the crime scene because it has all been redacted.  How can the jurors make a fair conclusion in a case like that?</p>

        <p>Exactly. People call others uneducated. How can someone even be educated when only one side of a debate is allowed to present their material.</p>
