    <strong>several burning questions that ive had. i guess it could also be considered a thought experiment</strong>
    <p><p>currently, in this reality, the mainstream media ( aka the corporate press), spews out pro government, pro oligarch, and pro ruling elitist propaganda. theyre constantly spewing out fear porn. they shove the number of covid cases and covid deaths down everyone's throat. they talk about covid deaths 247. its death porn; its like they have a creepy fetish for covid deaths. and its not just covid propaganda. its russigate, anti trump, pro millitary industrial complex, pro war on terror, pro surveillance state, anti whistleblower, pro duopoly propaganda. in the past, they propagandized the herd if sheep into supporting the wars in iraq and afghanistan.  theyve propagandized people into supporting the state, its oligarch owners, and the systems that violate people's freedoms. theyve propagandized people into accepting every form of tyranny and violation of liberty. </p>
<p>during this pandemic, theyve propagandized sheeple into gladly accepting lockdowns, mask mandates, social distancing laws, and gathering bans. theyve manipulated the sheeple into hating non conformists, anti conformists, questioners of authority, and questioners of the mainstream narratives. and many propagandized sheep are inflicting violence against free thinkers and non conformists. </p>
<p><strong><em>that said, i cannot help but wonder...</em></strong></p>
<p>what if the mainstream media had a very adversarial relationship with the state &amp; its oligarch owners instead of a symbiotic one? what if the mainstream media peddled hatred of the state and the oligarchs rather than spewed out propaganda on their behalf?</p>
<p>imagine if the mainstream media caused people to hate the entirety state and the oligarchs that own it. what if supporters of the state and its oligarch owners were maligned, smeared, and hated?  imagine if the MSM caused people to hate mask wearers, the "stay the fuck home!" crowd, social distancers, mask mandate enforcers, and pro lockdown assholes. i wonder what would happen if the mainstream media got everyone to hate every enactor, enforcer, and supporter of all the violations of liberty (like all the lockdown and mask mandate govenors).</p>
<p>what do you think would happen if people blindly hated authority instead of blindly obeyed authority?</p>
<p>i know its an extreme hypothetical, but it is interesting to think about. i am curious to read some of your thoughts, discussions,  feelings, and opinions</p>
<p>sorry for all this rambling word vomit</p></p>

        <p>I think a lot of people would hate authority, then. Look how the media got people to hate Trump (I actually don't like him, but I don't hate on him like it's my hobby or something).</p>

        <p>Do you remember the Sars pandemic? Some of the media tried to make it into a huge deal and spread panic, but it didn't work because many journalists actually reported the truth at the time. This time it worked perfectly because now all the big media companies have been bought up by big corporations with their own interests in mind,  and journalists have become nothing but PR.</p>
<p>Media companies don't have a choice what they say anymore. But if, let's say 20 years ago, the media decided to make propaganda against the state, I think they would just be bought up and put on a leash before they could do any real damage</p>
