    <strong>Future potential destroyed</strong>
    <p><p>The great joke is that i found about this sub from a youtube comment that insulted this group and when i discovered it i found out some really great information that is worth further investigation. I also have an affinity to read these people (the elite if you will) a bit because i dealt with their ilk for 13 years. The "leaders" who push the vaccines are almost entirely psychopathic. Not entirely so as they feel fear and are very much afraid of consequences, but beyond themselves and their immediate family, they view you as lesser beings, and they get very angry and gesticulate to make a point about you following their steps. It is surreal to me when i see this but i saw Bill Gates at one point quickly change his personality a few times so he can be authoritative and get his point out as quickly as he could, then reverted back to his weak gleeful soft self.</p>
<p>The elite of the world unlike the normal sleepers, have the ability to "change faces" so to speak in order to deal with situations, i think they were trained since childhood for this, and some people were built to be the humans they would become, such as Adolf Hitler who also had quick personality changes. You train a human being to have multiple personality disorders by breaking them, then rebuilding them, so i think mental and physical abuse play a great role in building Gates as well. I can not say the same for Fauci, he is like a machine who shits vaccines and edicts, the powers that be put him in that position, turned the on button and forgot how to build a turn off button.</p>

<p>However, as great as it is to see people here talking about anything they want, i read a lot of r/CovidVaccinated with lots of people with side effects, but this one screwed me up a bit. Here we have a man barely out of his teens, being totally screwed over by the pfizer shot. Just read his history, scroll up and see how this "gift" entered his life and how this concoction degenerated him to the point that he wants to die.</p>

<p>It's also of note, that about a week ago that sub removed the orange side effects tab, they know that most people skim through the titles and the people who control the flow of information of that group think they can get away with this.</p>
<p>I hope there are a lot of people insulting this sub, people will come and see what's up, school days are over, some people genuinely want to learn what the hell is going on.</p></p>
