    <strong>I regret being ignorant</strong>
    <p><p>Ok i will most likely get downvoted to hell or removed but anyway i recently got Covid 19 and for my experience it wasnt fun at all and was worse than your common cold or flu</p>
<p>And quick side note you can chose to belive me or not or mark me as a domer for not being part of this echo chaber whatever im just posting this warn people who were like me who were forced to this ignorance</p>
<p>Anyway after i got tested positive at a hospital since my family told me so (And im glad they did) it wasnt bad for the first few days until i had difficult breathing and felt like i was choking on my own spit 24/7 and eventuly ended up hospitalized with a ventalator helping me breathe.</p>
<p>And right now im recovering steadly for the most part though pumonia hit my lungs pretty hard and i might have some damanged airsacks but none the less i should be good to go in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Ok so if made this far without going in the comments without saying anything like doomer or fake ect. Thank you for reading my story and of you are being pressutered by anyone around you like my conspiracy freinds who basicly convienced me to do non-complaince since the government was big bad
Could track you and brainwash you or big bad reset just dont belive any of this it will only end up hurting you more and possibly everyone around you as well</p>
<p>TLDR:I had corona and it was really unpleasant </p>
<p>Also sorry for bad grammar since english isnt really my first lenguage to type in</p></p>

        <p>Covid can be bad for some people. For the vast majority is not. In any case, it is not dangerous enough to warrant shutting down/changing society, giving government unlimited unconstitutional indefinite powers, or wearing masks that are completely useless.</p>

        <p>Okay well most people don’t end up going to a hospital or being on a ventilator in fact that’s happening less and less so shut up</p>
<p>Just Bc you had corona and it was bad doesn’t mean the criticisms as a response to lockdowns and agendas are invalid</p>
