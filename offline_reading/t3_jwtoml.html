    <strong>Is our nation suffering from some kind of collective amnesia?</strong>
    <p><p>I seem to remember a time when most Americans had a healthy distrust for the government. Distrust might be the wrong word, more like a lack of trust in its competence...  We didn't always question its motives, but its reputation for fucking up whatever it was trying to do was legendary. Even president Ronald Reagan admitted it when he said something like "'I'm from the government and I'm here to help' are the nine scariest words in the English language."</p>
<p>Most Americans also knew that the media never got a story 100% right and usually sensationalized stories to create tension...  "If it bleeds it leads" on the nightly news.</p>
<p>I suppose the youth can have a pass for not learning this stuff yet, but what the hell happened to the adults in this country? In my short life alone it's been exposed that the government colluded with the media to create fake news to build support for TWO wars in just Iraq, not to mention there have been multiple scandals in various stages of being exposed throughout my whole life, and doubtless many others that media chose not to expose and many others they never found out about...  The Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies are known the world over for their dirty tricks...  The government has apologized for experimenting on unwitting people all over the world at least 239 times... Shit...  Most if not all the federal laws Congress passes are written by the industries that will benefit from them written and are pushed lobbyists who pay millions to get them passed...  The only things that get bipartisan support are military intervention, domestic surveillance, corporate bailouts, deregulation of banking, etc...</p>

<p>I don't know all there is to know about covid-19, but I know I'm being lied to and there is some nefarious purpose behind all this. I have a good idea what that is (Klaus Schwab wrote multiple books explaining his organization's agenda for fucks sake... I'm sure there are other agendas in play as well...)</p>
<p>Well, at least I'm just ten years away from being happy. I won't have any possessions (because Klaus and his billionaire buddies will own it all) but I'll be happy. (I can't find the English language version of "Eight predictions for 2030" on YouTube anymore but here's the Spanish version straight from the World Economic Forum...  https://youtu.be/ZzdCTyMWQBs  ) </p>
<p>WHY DOES ANYONE TRUST WHAT THE GOVERNMENT AND MEDIA SAYS???</p>

        <p>Yes the "Globalist" need to be brought to trial for their crimes against the west! We can start by stopping all aid to Israel and seizing the hollywood propaganda machine. However, that would take an organized group of people united under one goal with an unquestionable leader. Why is Fascism always the answer to these degenerates?</p>

        <p>Their greatest weapon is fear. When you dig down into who was behind most major domestic terrorist attacks, you inevitably turn up the three letter agencies. The reason is simple: a scared populace does not think rationally. The reptile brain flight or fight response kicks in and they're more than willing to bow down to any "authority" that promises them safety.</p>

        <p>Answer: Because the truth is that on the bulk of subjects the government is a minor good while private enterprises are a minor evil on the same subjects.</p>
<p>You have private enterprises paying non-living wages to people. You have private enterprises refusing to give good health insurance to their workers simply because "They do not work enough!"</p>

        <p>It's always been the United States of Amnesia (like a wise man once said). That's why we're in this mess. The "truth" changes literally overnight and apparently no one remembers what the media and their anointed experts were saying just a week before.</p>
