    <strong>Stop preaching the need to be peaceful</strong>
    <p><p>Some of you sicken me and I really mean that. I am sick and tired of the cowards on this sub who are constantly saying things like, "be peaceful" or "we have to be the bigger person."</p>
<p>Fuck that! Fighting a clean, fair fight against someone who cheats, and winning only happens in movies people. It's a fairy tale. Do you think the opposition has any intention of "being the bigger person?" Do you think they have been fighting fair?!</p>
<p>If they want to fight us with fire I say we start dropping nukes. I'm done with "peaceful protest" this and "discussion" that. The time for optics is over, because they don't care.</p>
<p>It's so clear that they have taken down the tennis net and are just doing anything and everything to kill our way of life by force. A stampeding bull will trample over flowers, but will yield to a brick wall. Be angry people. Our founding fathers would've started riots ages ago.</p></p>

        <p>Privacy is dead. You are victim to the chilling effect. If they ban us, we will brigade them instead. Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. Trust me, they want us thinking out loud. When we go quiet, they get scared.</p>

        <p>This account basically has been lying dormant until this last week after being created 8 months ago and is now doing this stuff.</p>
<p>People can do stupid things but thinking that this sub is a platform to organize violence/revolution is pretty stupid and I would assume that all of the legit users know this.  Anyways, this account is done afaic.  Please report this type of thing so we can take it down asap.  Thanks.</p>

        <p>My personal philosophy is "kill em with kindness". I dont need to be a shouting Karen. I smile my way straight through all of it.  </p>
<p>And it has served me very well over time. When masks were mandated in grocery stores here i quickly found out that very very few places asked about it. In my tiny village no one ever asked. In the larger villages just one town over a store clerk lady once asked me "are you exempt? " and i just smiled and said no, truthfully, looked her in the eyes and walked past. She did nothing.  </p>
<p>I make a point to smile extra nicely at the checkout clerks and stockboy when i ask them to help me find stuff. I used to try and avoid the staff roaming the aisles thinking "' if they dont see me maybe they wont ask about my masklessness" but i quickly found out i needn't bother. I could just walk straight up to them sans mask and ask them to help me find item X , smile nicely and they would help me get the item without a word on the mask topic.</p>
<p>I learned to go to the store at certain times when I knew the cashier would be there who also went maskless and would make a point of getting in her queue each time so  we both could see an uncovered human face.  </p>
<p>I decided to speak with my money the few times i did get confronted. A certain fast food chain with golden arches was really anal about the masks. I haven't been back since and have swapped it for my local snackbar and found out I like fresh crispy  Loempias more than i liked twice-the-price sloppy burgers. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dont let them find reason to demonize us on that front. </p>
<p>I've had to remove plenty of comments even today on this sub telling us to hang ourselves, or die a painful covid death or worse. </p>
<p>Dont give them grounds. Kill em with kindness.</p>

<p>Correct. <br>
Not that they make it easier.   </p>
<p>But OP's post and others like it make us head closer towards conflict on both sides rather then away. <br>
"If they want to fight us with fire I say we start dropping nukes. I'm done with "peaceful protest" this and "discussion" that. The time for optics is over, because they don't care."  </p>
<p>Fallout would have consequences for people who are innocent, figuratively and literally.</p>

Never said that.   </p>
<p>"How long do we stay silent?" Big difference between staying silent and nuking.   </p>
<p>"Do we wait until they start vaccinating kids in schools without their parents' knowledge"<br>
No  </p>
<p>"I refuse for this to be a one sided fight"<br>
No one is asking you to. If you don't play smart it makes it easier to judge your actions and statements as everyone's who oppose the growing state power and ignorant practices of covid response.</p>

        <p>The phrase "nuking" wasn't literal. It was an alliteration to fighting fire with fire.</p>
<p>Yes, you did say that there would be casualties among innocents as though there hasn't been already.</p>
<p>Look, I get where you're coming from. I do. But this country didn't develop because the colonists peacefully protested themselves away from the British. Sometimes it takes more than that and we are living through it in real time. </p>
<p>And maybe it's just me being fed up with all of this and taking it out in the wrong way. For that I apologize. But when I see people with the means to defend themselves not doing so over and over, it makes me lose hope.</p>

        <p>I find the best move from my experience is to make them be the crazy ones. When you can keep a level head and show them why it's totally valid to question the state's response to the pandemic and the highly questionable state of vaccine rollout.   </p>
<p>Make them frothing at the bit, angry and ready to scramble. Makes it easier to help people in the middle find their way.   </p>
<p>It's all good bro, totally normal to be frustrated by all this shit.</p>

        <p>This sub-reddit, and other sub-reddits that question the narrative are on a short leash. They itching to ban us for any given reason. There are people who rely on this sub-reddit for their mental sanity, and it would be a huge disservice if openly called for violence as you are implying.</p>
<p>Do I think that the argument is exhausted and it is time to stand to our guns? Yes, I do, however, there will be a time a place for that, and it is not now. Calling for open conflict right now is antithetical to what this sub-reddit is about. We want things to be peacefully done, with no bloodshed and no one getting hurt; it can be done (look at SD, TX, FL). Positive change is happening, the problem is that it is slow and coming. I have surmised, that until they give us a reason to not be nice, continue to be nice until they cross that line. </p>
<p>Remember, by calling for Civil War 2.0, if and when it does start, it is not going to be pretty because not only are we armed to the teeth, but we have nukes and imagine a standing president authorizing nuclear weapons on American soil, concentration camps, bombings of full cities and things going to shit.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying don’t turn up the heat. </p>
<p>Just be aware the difference between us trying to organize and say BLM/Antifa. They are either ignored because it’s for social justice, straight up supported by media and government actors, or even exonerated from their documented crimes.</p>
<p>We would not get the same treatment. We would have gov infiltration. </p>
<p>Again, not saying to remain peaceful punching bags for riot cops, but beware sheep in wolves clothing.</p>

        <p>Be angry at the government, sure.</p>
<p>But all this infighting amongst family/friends does nothing to prohibit tyranny...quite the opposite when you can't count on those closest to you to forgive and eventually work together.</p>
<p>How are you going to forgive and work together if you completely sever ties because they were duped by very effective, professional fear propaganda?</p>
<p>Are anonymous reddit users going to help?</p>
