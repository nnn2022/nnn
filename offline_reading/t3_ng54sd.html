    <strong>I believe we will see a huge mask drop by the end of June</strong>
    <p><p>Not only are more states and more stores are lifting the mandate, but things will look brighter and we'll see a lot more faces in June. Definitely by July 4th and here is why.</p>
<p>Most businesses will see loads of people going to places that don't have a mandate in the summer. It'll be hot weather going into the summer so the "desire" to wear a mask will be deceased. A lot of state of emergencies are also expiring. Another month will go by when people could make the decision to get vaccinated or not. Especially with walk ins now available people can't say "it's not fair people are going maskless when I wasn't able to get my shot yet"!</p>
<p>There's also the 4th of July and that's when you will see almost no masks all together. It's the day of Independence and even Biden himself said that was a date "we could look forward to removing our masks" so even his followers will drop their masks. Saying that they could because of "Biden" so you know if you have a mask off Democrats can say "Well we waited for Biden to say it's okey".</p>
<p>Anyways what do you guys think? Will July 4th be a big day where we will see a huge removal of masks?</p></p>

        <p>A control measure put in place by a government will never be removed like that without force of the public. It is more likely that masks will be replaced by an alternative, new measure. You need to start to think like governments to understand why we are in this situation like we are.</p>

        <p>Yes. Feels like more than half this sub is "celebrating" and are basically patting the government on the back for "freeing" them. It's disgusting. They're not going to give up this crisis so easily without mass civil disobedience. As you said, they'll likely do something else, and honestly, I don't think they'll let masks go. Once the "deadly variant" hysteria begins to ramp up, they'll force masks on us again.</p>

        <p>I've been saying for months this sub must oppose masks and social distancing. Once those are gone we need to lobby for accountability. Vote them out and put some of these bastards in jail for the lockdowns.</p>
<p>We shouldnt celebrate the murderers and tyrants giving us back something that was ours this entire time.</p>

        <p>People here are idiots. Let's just accept that. They're just as gullible as the rest of the populace. The fact they say shit like "Wow, (x governor) was a dick but now that he's re-opening, he's a great guy" is just ignorant. They don't care about freedom, they're just selfish fucks who want shit to re-open so they can go do their shit again. They'll never resist in any meaningful way.</p>

        <p>Oh I don't think so.  You can tell that no one who's bought into this whole scamademic is not ever going to take off their masks.   Not now, not ever.</p>

        <p>I believe they might remove  masks soon but not the new normal, probably covid passports will be implemented so you have to show your vaccine passport to buy, Instead of defending masks they are going to be defending the vaccine passports.</p>

        <p>I think they're going to try to keep both. It sounds weird, yes, but it seems like the masks factor into the agenda somehow (probably for dehumanization and reduce socialization). What could happen is they keep masks for "spikes" and other "dangers" during the flu season, and still implement vaccine passports.</p>
