    <strong>What if we all leave civilisation behind?</strong>
    <p><p>Sometimes I think civilisation is just a scam. It does have its benefits but unless we have a civilisation based on decentralised power and full freedom then what’s the point? Does it make sense that technology gets better yet we all work the same hours, if not more? If they give people less hours with more pay to make up for the increased efficiency of technology wouldn’t that eliminate the lack of jobs caused by technology? But no, they don’t care about us. They don’t see people, they see profits. People working hours on hours with stressful lives, some ending up on meds. People homeless without food to eat, the media dividing people and fear mongering. And to top it all off now we’re losing our rights of freedom, it’s too much.</p>
<p>SO</p>
<p>What if we all just leave civilisation? All these problems wouldn’t exist. Think about it, do we really need jobs to survive? No. Jobs just give us money, and money buys food. We can just live off of the wilderness for free but instead we choose to slave away for a dystopian civilisation. Who convinced us that if we don’t work for these tyrants we’ll go hungry? Who convinced us that we need them? Our ancestors have lived in the wilderness for thousands of years, surviving and thriving. Probably much more happy and fulfilled than we are, and Definitely much more free. I think it’s very important that we all educate ourselves on how to survive and thrive in nature. Hunting, trapping, building, crafting etc etc. Even if you don’t ever plan leaving this dystopian civilisation, at least have the peace of mind knowing that if worse comes to worse, you have the option to leave if you need to.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with you. Becoming our own self sufficient societies would completely deteriorate the governments power over us. When will people realise they can’t eat money?  If we do carry out this idea in the future I assume we’d be a minority compared to the rest of the world. Not a lot of people are willing nor cut out to live in the wilderness, and as this idea is a danger to the governments power, the government could attempt to make it an us vs them situation. So we’d need weapons to protect ourselves with.</p>

        <p>I've done some hobby gardening in the past. It's pretty difficult to raise enough food even to offset commercial food purchases. But, you're right, "civilisation" has become unhinged and barbaric. The reason though is the internet, they have taken the wilderness out of the human mind. I intent to unplug from all internet next month. It won't make an impact, but I'll be goddamned if I give another penny to these techie peeping toms.</p>

        <p>I've lived on a few communes before, and the only reason I left (other than to travel to another part of the country in my adventuring days) was so I could work to buy my own bit of land, and set up my own community. Someone has to buy the land, you see. But yes, it is a better lifestyle. Everyone would gather for dinner most evenings, there'd be a communal hearth. Everyone grew what they could and shared it, worked when they wanted on building and improving their little cabin homes, and the best part, was the knowledge that was shared. Knowledge about botanical medicine, survival skills, building, navigating by the stars, reading the landscape, music, ideas, everything. </p>
<p>Conflict can and does arrive, so there needs to be a cohesive understanding of how to deal with it. And you could just do all this on your own, but humans need community. With communes though, the power is tilted in favour of the land owner, which isn't always a bad thing but something to always bear in mind. </p>
<p>But you are exactly right in that this is how humans were meant to live. </p>
<p>Real hippies own guns and can build a house from scratch. This is why they've been maligned and ridiculed even to this day - because what they were really about was living a free and natural life away from wage slavery and government control. Read about Cedar Bay in Far North Queensland in the 80's for a prime example, they got firebombed by the cops.</p>

        <p>/u/<em>EllieLOL</em> and /u/Player4L , I sometimes wish some billionaire would just build a high-rise tower and use a combination of solar, wind, and even natural gas and nuclear power to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>Indoor high-rise farming so that we can feed more people. Also, as a means to reduce run-off from fertilizer. That's actually a pretty big issue.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a bit off topic but you both raise good points. I sometimes think about how unsustainable it would be for too many people to live like hunter-gatherers. In reading a book about Geoge Custer, it was pointed out that nomadic North-American Indian tribes always left refuse piles behind when it was time to move and setup a new camp.</p>
<p>It never occured to me, I always ate-up the surface-level knowledge from school which said "the Indians never waste anything -- they believe in using the whole animal." This is true but not entirely... even they had limits on what they're willing to recycle, apparently.</p>

        <p>I’m aware of this, I’m sure we could come up with something sustainable. Maybe balancing what we eat  by eating a more plant based diet for parts of the year. We could also breed enough farm animals to balance eating both wild and domesticated animals, while also avoiding the over hunting of a single species. Also, as bad as this sounds. Not everyone is cut out for wilderness survival, not everyone is willing to live in the wild. So I’m sure we don’t have to worry about the majority of the world’s population living this way.</p>
