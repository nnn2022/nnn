        <p>Trump didn't make the vaccine, and I seriously doubt he has done any research on why this vaccine is or isn't a good idea.</p>
<p>This might come as a shock, but Trump supporters don't think he's infallible or doesn't do anything we don't like. Its not a cult for christ sakes.</p>

        <p>This post got deleted so I’m not sure if this will make it to you, but do you support trump? You seem intelligent enough and I’d really like to know the reasons if you’re willing to share. I have a few coworkers who are “on the trump train”, and their arguments are kind of unclear to me.</p>

        <p>I'll preface this with the hope that I can be concise, but thorough. I've never really sat down and listed everything, since it's a lot of little things that happened over the years that culminated in throwing my hat in for Trump.</p>
<p>Briefly, I'll just say that growing up I had a general sense that Republicans tended to be abut crony capitalism and economic expansion throughout the world. I also had the sense that democrats were supposed to be more moderate on foreign policy and generally helped boost the economy here at home. What can I say, I grew up in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>I joined the army and ended up attached to the 3rd Infantry when we took Baghdad. I saw a lot of good done for the wrong reasons, but could live with that. A second tour a few years later completely destroyed the illusion that we were helping the region any more, even if I did feel that we were initially in 03.</p>
<p>So I was less than thrilled about Bush, and looked forward to Obama for the things I expected from democrats based on my earlier expectations. Surprise surprise, he was worse than Bush on both foreign and domestic policy. Extrajudicial killings, expanding executive powers to an absurd degree, bailing out corporations without any oversight or plan that would make it work for the average citizen.</p>
<p>So to me, Obama and the democrats were a nightmare. I still didn't like republicans, but at least they didn't seem to do anything proactively harmful. When Trump entered the scene I didn't take him seriously at all and wrote him off. I hated Hilary because she represented more of the same of what Obama did, and Trump seemed like a joke. So I didn't vote in 2016.</p>
<p>After a year into Trump's presidency, I started to notice things. Namely, my friends who are huge liberals, would say something about Trump that sounded ridiculous. I'd go look at the news report, then try to track down the original context because I couldn't believe the insanity that I was hearing about Trump. Charlottesville was a wake up call. Everything reported in regards to very fine people was a straight up lie. I started looking into accusations of racism and homophobia, lie after lie.</p>
<p>I started learning that Trump was the first elected president who supported gay marriage BEFORE running for office. That for years he was a pillar of the lack community and had been honored and befriended by the major organizations and leaders for decades. Then started looking at what he was doing. Cutting off illegal immigration was a big deal for me. Not because I hate "brown people," but because of documented crime rates, drugs, and the fact that the people who make it here are essentially second class citizens with no real rights. Essentially a slave class. This needed to stop in my opinion, and despite the democrats calling for action in years past, they now rallied against Trump for the simple fact that it was Trump doing it.</p>
<p>After this Trump continued to surprise me. Crossing the DMZ into North Korea was when I was convinced that he was a guy who knew how to get things done and would do right by the country and the world. No one thought that NK would ever enter into negotiations with the west. No one thought that the middle east would ever see peace with Israel. No one thought that manufacturing jobs could come back to the states and we could see a record low unemployment rate.</p>
<p>Trump did the impossible. Was he perfect? No. I despise his ban on bump stocks. His vitriol on Twitter just adds fuel for his critics. Calling for burning the American flag to be illegal is a horrible idea. He's hired so many crappy aides and advisors its not funny. Not getting ahead of tech censorship likely cost him a second term. But despite it all, the one thing that makes me support Trump more than anything else?</p>
<p>He isn't in anyone's pocket. He's not a career politician who's net worth has gone up by millions since being in office. He's not going to go on to some cushy advisory position and get paid to do nothing by a company he helped during his presidency. He's sacrificed billions in net worth, and probably destroyed his family's legacy for generations by subjecting himself to all the lies and hate from the media. And for what? Because he truly believes in America and stepped up to help guide her back on the right path, and was beholden to no one but his own ideals.</p>
<p>I don't like everything he's done, but more often than not, he's done what needs to be done because he isn't afraid that the right thing isn't politically correct, or the "way things are done" in politics.</p>

        <p>I appreciate you taking the time, thank you. Just so I don’t misrepresent myself, I wasted my vote this year by writing my own name in for president. I couldn’t bring myself to support trump because of his apparent selfishness, and I couldn’t support joe biden’s impotent campaign of “hey guys I’m not trump”. I ask myself “would either of these clowns sacrifice themselves to make our lives better?”, and everything I see points to fuck no. </p>
<p>Does it bother you at all as a veteran that trump doesn’t seem to hold the military in high esteem? I can’t think of a specific instance that stands out, but over the years he has just seemed to show disdain for actual servicemen and women, often just in his vocal tonality and smirk. Is it shameful at all that the commander in chief is also essentially someone who refused to go to war for his country? </p>
<p>I like your take on illegal immigration, I don’t often hear anyone mention that these people are actually being exploited once they’re here, and often have no upward mobility at all. If more people understood this, I think the “left and right” might actually agree on the issue.</p>

        <p>With Trump and the military, I just haven't seen anything that stands out as him having disdain, but to be fair I'm not necessarily looking for it. </p>
<p>As weird as it sounds, I don't mind him dodging the draft. I don't particularly like the draft, and think its unfortunate that anyone was drafted to fight a foreign war. Admittedly I fought in a foreign war, and that was based on lies, but I was still a volunteer. I volunteered as a way to open future opportunities when I was a year out of high school and didn't really have any prospects. Some people in our society would probably benefit from a service term to help them grow up, but ultimately I believe in personal freedom above anything else. A reluctant soldier is a worthless soldier imo.</p>
<p>The justifications and reasons for the Vietnam War are a whole other bag of worms, so I'll just say that I'm not sure it would have been fighting for this country if he had gone and plenty of presidents haven't served or actively avoided it before. I care more about his performance now than choices he made as a youth that may or may not have been right. </p>
<p>His performance with the military now is something I can feel some pride in. Keeping us out of new conflicts, threading the needle with Iran, bolstering our military to keep China from taking Taiwan, and also bringing troops home is a big deal to me. I always admired Kennedy keeping us out of conflict with Russia while still appearing strong on the world stage. I feel that Trump has emulated that to high degree. With Hilary I fully believe we would have had major warfare with Iran, probably with no end in sight.</p>
