    <strong>I'd prefer no teachers to...</strong>
    <p><p>...bad ones.</p>
<p>My niece-in-law is doing virtual school. She doesn't have headphones or a headset, so the family can hear everything.</p>
<p>The teacher she and her class is working with sounds so damn cranky, like she doesn't want to have to deal with the kids at all. She is raising her voice for the every instruction, angry with the kids for the slightest mistake or because they can't seem to figure out how the camera works. These kids are fourth graders.</p>
<p>Before summer, my niece very much missed school - particularly, her friends - and didn't want to do distance learning at all because, in her words, "it wasn't the same". Now that she's been doing virtual school for two weeks, she says she prefers it... because the teachers don't spit in the kids' faces when they talk to/yell at them. In-person learning is supposed to resume in October, and she doesn't want to go back at all. If the teachers on her virtual school are any indication, I can see why (although before school did close, my niece never told or hinted to any of us she was unhappy at school about anything; not even her mom, who she tells <em>everything</em>, suspected something).</p></p>

<p>Being able to shut the kids up and force them to comply is a dream come true for many teachers.</p>

        <p>&rt; my niece never told or hinted to any of us she was unhappy at school about anything </p>
<p>children get thrown into schools, without being asked and without given any other options and are then left alone without parents at an extremely young age.</p>
<p>this mixed with how children are dealing with negative experiences in general very very often leads to children not telling the parents, that they deep down absolutely hate a lot about school and would much rather stay at home with mummy/parents.</p>
<p>children are generally never asked, if they want to go back to school even at all, they are told, that "they have to go to school!" and in a situation without escape and with parents throwing them into that situation the child on a subconscious level has to deal with it and that includes at bare minimum not telling people.</p>
<p>i have a great suggestion for her mother though, that you should probably give her:</p>
<p>DON'T let her go back to this school, the school will most likely have straight up torture methods in place, that include social isolation from all her friends, slave muzzles, etc...</p>
<p>so the friends,  that were likely at least one of the good parts of being at school would be gone from that picture, so all that is left is horrible.</p>
<p>so again: DON'T ler back to school. </p>
<p>instead of throwing her into  this place of torture, that she already said,  she doesn't want to go back into, her mother and you can homeschool her.</p>
<p>even better you can make play dates with the friends, that she is missing and circle through which mother's will take care of the children for playdates and at the playdates half of the time will be used for something funny and education, like reading and discussing some books or whatever.</p>
<p>this way the children  are not in a place of torture, not getting yelled at by a moron through the internet, but instead are with their friends and other mothers  and are learning at least a bit too.</p>
<p>oh and also of course no slave mask, no social isolation, but instead some  joy and connection, which very very likely she is craving a lot already. i mean i assume you and family is doing the best you can, but seeing and being with her same age friends would be something different of course again.</p>
<p>basically: don't accept government torturing children. the most simple solution to avoid it completely  is a million times better already.</p>
