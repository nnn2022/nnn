    <strong>About 77% of businesses and over 90% of states do not require masks</strong>
    <p><p>With all of the "confusion" regarding who can and can't wear and mask, when, and where...I made a website that uses simple tests to break down the data.</p>
<p>https://maskstatus.net/</p>
<p>About 77% of major businesses and over 90% of states essentially do not require masks. Many get into this lingo of, "no masks if you have a vaccine, but this, except this, but also that..." - and do not require any proof of vaccination.</p>
<p>Let me make this simple: if the business/state does not require proof of a vaccination, and the business/state has conditional mask requirements based on vaccination status, then there is no mask requirement for all people in actuality.</p>
<p>A super-majority of businesses and states are back to normal. No new normal. Sorry, doomers!</p>
<p>Edit: the data I am referencing is in relation to the US. I am open to enhancing things to accommodate other countries.</p></p>

        <p>This is appreciated for those of us who are surrounded by crazy people and can only see remotely through the eyes of a highly censored internet.</p>
<p>I'm crossing my fingers that what we're experiencing now is a last desperate push rather than a rush to "70%" so that they can REALLY bring it down hard on the rest of us.</p>
<p>Anecdotally I'm seeing the effects of coercive vaccination in the workplace causing people I know who don't want it, to go through with it. And seeing them suffer from the side effects.</p>
<p>The guy yesterday got 80 hours of PTO from his shipping company in return for getting the vaccine. But he was so effected by it, so hurt. He came across like he was brain damaged. And when he handed something to my brother in law real awkwardly ---- by brother in law said, "What's wrong with you? Why did you hand that to me like that?!?"</p>
<p>And the guy's shoulders dropped and his head hung low and he said, so weakly, "Sorry man. I'm... I'm really struggling here." Before retiring for the evening.</p>
<p>That was his first shot.</p>
<p>My father-in-law was found in his bathroom, collapsed on the floor after his second shot. His wife thought he was dead for a scary moment.</p>
<p>A pro-lockdown 17 year old family friend collapsed within two minutes of her second shot, there at the scene.</p>
<p>My wife's friend was never the same after hers. It's been weeks and she went from being real outgoing and energetic, a little bit athletic even -- to being sluggish. She doesn't seem as sharp or bright anymore after taking it.</p>
<p>My dad took the Pfizer shot and he's just not who he used to be. He can't follow complex thoughts anymore and his attention span has been reduced to nothing.</p>
<p>I've never seen anything like this from any traditional vaccines (except for my uncle who was one of the unfortunate victims of the original polio vaccine when they used the live virus. He contracted polio from the vaccine itself, and ended up a former varsity football player to a sick guy with a deformed leg. He went on to have drug problems all his life and died in prison.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, I don't really care what people do with their lives as long as they don't force their opinions on me. Masks? Vaccines? Lockdowns? Have fun with that, but I don't wish to partake - and the lies, propaganda, censorship, and force is enough that "that side" no longer has any credibility.</p>

        <p>Correct. As of the beginning of this week: Hawaii, California, Oregon, and West Virginia have mask mandates. You can track that data at MaskStatus.</p>
<p>California dropped theirs today (but Newsom said he will add some clarity with new executive orders this week, so the site isn't updated for California yet).</p>

        <p>Nevadan here. I've noticed that since the CDC dropped the masks, there seems to be even more people here wearing them in ridiculous, clearly unnecessary situations, like bicycling alone or driving. The virtue signaling is crazy. It's 113 degrees here right now too. That has to be miserable.</p>

        <p>I live in California, and Newsom will probably just leave it up to the companies. And since most are down with mask wearing, they will make their “essential employees” AKA minimum wage workers wear masks their whole shift until TBD. As for patrons, I’m sure that will also be up to the company and you’ll see some continue to ask that people wear a mask. I’m actually going to take my dog for a walk in about an hour. Gonna walk into some local businesses and see if they tell me to mask up.</p>

        <p>Medical facilities, schools, transportation hubs....... still require masks.</p>
<p>But that's because even though C-19 is the most dangerous virus in a hundred years, it's not so deadly today on the 15th as it was yesterday on the 14th and not so deadly in Costco but still super duper deadly in a classroom.</p>

        <p>That’s my biggest gripe with California. Like one day changes anything lol. They also chose to re open on a Tuesday? Why? Every other state dropped their mask mandates June 11th, a Friday, the end of the week. This allowed for businesses to be fully open on the weekend. California not only said, “Fuck that” they didn’t even open fully on Monday to start the work week, they waited until Tuesday the 15th, why? Why couldn’t we fully re open yesterday to start the week?</p>

        <p>The hypocrisy is astounding.  Newsome tells people to stay home and replace their mask between bites, eats out with multiple families with nary a mask in sight.  I point that out to some people and they just shrug, say 'yeah, I don't really like that', but soon forget all about it.</p>
<p>Where about in California are you?  I'm in the Inland Empire.</p>
