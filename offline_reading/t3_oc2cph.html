        <p>The reason I joined NNN is because I didn't come close to losing hope.  I never wore a mask while driving in a car. I never wore a mask at work. Didn't hide out in my house for a year and a half, I spent $$$ at mom-and-pop businesses that had the balls to stay open. Had a bunch of unmasked family and friends at my house for Christmas, Thanksgiving, 4th, Birthdays, and whenever I smoked a tri-tip/pork shoulder for my neighbors. Didn't get pumped with untested/unapproved chemicals (I chose to be in the control group). I am not anti-vax.  I received every vax that has been US approved since 1950.  I will probably get the COVID vax, when it is FULLY tested and approved- if that ever happens.</p>

        <p>I hate to be one of those people who turn off the news but God damn it is depressing.  The Delta variance is going to kill us all!!  what a steaming load of horseshit.  In all the stories of the so-called deadly Delta is there a there's little mention of the death toll which is declining even as Delta cases increase.</p>

        <p>I was close to being suicidal last year. That was when I made this account. Not that I wanted to actively kill myself but I just didn’t care if I lived or died. </p>
<p>I was living in a city where I had no real connections, for work. My partner flew across the country, helped me move and saved my life.</p>

        <p>I came close to this a few times last winter and being able to chat shit on here was one of the few things which kept me going. </p>
<p>So thanks to my NNN buddies, you're all heroes!</p>
