    <strong>Help me write a good email…</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a care worker in the UK. We are getting a lot of pressure to take the vaccine. We have a group of us who are refusing.</p>
<p>We have until October to prove we have been vaccinated. I will refuse until they fire me. But I really don’t want to leave. I love my job. </p>
<p>My manager and assistant manager are really good and are completely done with the whole ‘COVID’ thing. They don’t even want to mention vaccines at this point. Everyone in the home knows it’s a scam, we’ve had 6 positive cases this year. All with zero symptoms. Just a positive test and a lockdown. I’m yet to know anyone to die from covid. No one! </p>
<p>But my manager has asked me to write an email stating why I don’t want the vaccine. So she has it documented and can send it higher up. </p>
<p>I wanna really drive the point home, put together a really well written email with strong sources. Just facts. </p>
<p>I just need to gather the best sources. </p>
<p>Can people point me in the right direction? </p>
<p>Love this sub. Keep fighting!</p></p>

        <p>Send them this, but be prepared to be fired anyway:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system could be counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are often reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots">the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women</a> strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy, which is congruent with <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/">what vaccine companies already knew was possible, even prior to release</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">large study</a> of the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccine has a huge hole in it—they merely vaccinated participants and then hoped and prayed they would come into contact with the wild virus by chance. But there is no guarantee of exposure—far from it—so there is no actual test of safety OR efficacy, when you consider that most lab animals in previous coronavirus vaccine trials (which were systematically exposed to the virus they were vaccinated against) died of ADE, especially if they seemed to develop perfect antibodies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://id.elsevier.com/ACW/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com%2Faction%2FconsumeSsoCookie%3FredirectUri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.thelancet.com%252Faction%252FconsumeSharedSessionAction%253FI2KBRCK%253D1%2526JSESSIONID%253DaaaxMgxF_jwLS9MicyuOx%2526MAID%253DnwtDnnX6yA6uoIcAtieLwQ%25253D%25253D%2526SERVER%253DWZ6myaEXBLF%25252B9vQ18y9JMw%25253D%25253D%2526ORIGIN%253D844971718%2526RD%253DRD%2526exp%253D75icYvzOgUVEevYEfIgkYg%2525253D%2525253D%26code%3Dnull"><em>largest</em> study</a> of the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines also has a glaring problem with it—it does not account for the incongruent testing of vaccinated breakthrough versus unvaccinated/general cases. The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for vaccinated breakthrough versus an unvaccinated person is different. The one for the unvaccinated uses an <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces a useless result, that is, a 40-90% false positive rate</a>. The one the vaccinated are given, on the other hand, uses a much more reasonable <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>. What this means is that a lot more unvaccinated people are actually being misdiagnosed when they go to the hospital than vaccinated people are.</p>

        <p>Unnecessary.  By October the vaccinated will be crippled and you’ll be one of the few left able to work.  So even if they fire you they’ll beg for you to come back with many more patients to take care of.  So you’re going to have a lot of work over the next few years.</p>
