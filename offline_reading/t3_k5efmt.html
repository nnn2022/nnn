    <strong>Does anyone know what happens if you get a vaccine for a virus that you currently have?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm wondering how this is going to work with such a high percentage of asymptomatic cases, particularly given that viruses mutate fairly consistently causing many strains over time. </p>
<p>In the H1N1 vaccine, my understanding is that the main cause of the narcolepsy and/or cataplexy that some people got was from the rush-ordered adjuvant in the vaccine, obviously not the dead virus parts themselves.</p>
<p>So I am wondering, if you are asymptomatic with another strain of Covid, get the vaccine that is made to have the adjuvant react with the particular strain or Covid that the vaccine was made for (that is different from the one you have), is there significant potential for the adjuvant to react with your strain, giving a bad reaction?</p>
<p>And is there any way for them to have even tested for this in such a short time?</p>
<p>This is the main way I see the vaccine being dangerous, but I wanted to hear your thoughts as elsewhere people seem to get immediately offended.</p></p>

        <p>I have some virology training, I have been in published studies in college working with and isolating bacteriophages, which are admittedly different but do share mechanisms of action. Was hoping that there would be some people here with knowledge as well though</p>

        <p>The tests are completely unreliable and to cover the truth, they call all false positives as asymptomatics. If you believe  that there can be hundreds of asymptomatics in one place and not question the mainstream lies, you need to wake up.</p>

        <p>I know they are unreliable but that's not really what I was writing about. Most highly contagious viruses do have a significant portion of asymptomatic infections. Although often, not always, contagiousness is inversely proportional to deadliness for obvious reasons... but anyway I'm wondering about the risk of the adjuvant of the vaccine, in relation to various future strains of the virus, reacting poorly with the millions of genetic iterations that could affect the outcome</p>

        <p>If the tests are unreliable, everything else is irrelevant. There might not even be a pandemic at all and we are just dealing with a conflict of interests.</p>
<p>Regardless, i would rather die before injecting the DNA from the lungs of a 14 days aborted fetus that had the cells cloned repeatedly, until they reached a genetic code that cannot be replicated in nature.</p>
<p>Every measure against covid is a crime against humanity and we should hang the leaders of all countries that imposed those measures without a public vote, instead of arguing the safety of the grotesque vaccine.</p>

<p>They've been working on this for decades, its the great reset.</p>
<p>The virus in the vaccine is an RNA that commands your DNA to produce antibodies to the common cold, you should be immune to all coronaviruses, temporarily. This is why people that had a cold last year are likely to be "asymptomatic".</p>
<p>The problem is, what other RNA is in this cocktail from hell?</p>
