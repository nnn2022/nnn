    <strong>The Obese are most afraid --&gt; maybe they should take the stairs and not the elevator</strong>
    <p><p>So I was entering my elevator here and I bumped into a neighbor for the 2nd time today, first time was just moments earlier as I was going down and it stopped on his floor, but he chose not to enter.</p>
<p>As I was passing him on the way into to the elevator he walked out and he said more/less</p>
<p>"I don't understand why everyone isn't wearing a mask. It's required."</p>
<p>I told him - "They don't work anyway and no, not for outdoors."</p>
<p>He replied - "Are you sure, maybe you should check that."</p>
<p>And that was it...but a few days earlier while waiting for an elevator a different neighbor - who is also clearly obese - didn't want to be in the elevator with me at the same time. I let her go first.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>At work, the people who are most concerned are clearly obese / more overweight ones - though not uniform.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Now, this sucks if you are obese. Ok, I get it. You are scared. But <strong>don't project your fear on me!</strong>  Educate yourself, and start addressing the reasons you are fat/obese.   Do a deep dive on health. SELF-REFLECT on your life. Take some responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>And start with not taking elevators - take the stairs! Like I frequently do, and just may do exclusively...so I don't have to deal with these folk.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe that should be my answer...."Have you considered the stairs?"  [It's only a few floors]</p>
<p>..of course then...I might have to deal with their BS in the stairway.</p>
<p>Maybe I should print out a MASKS DON'T WORK sheet and give it to him...of course...he might be paranoid touching the piece of paper.</p></p>

        <p>It’s not surprising to me that people who have gotten themselves into a state of obesity are blaming everyone else for their poor health. </p>
<p>Listen I’m a bigger girl. Not obese but I know I could lose some pounds. Before all this, I didn’t take vitamins and maybe had a balanced diet day 1-2 times a week. Now I’m taking all the recommended supplements &amp; eating a balanced diet 5-6 times per week (Taco Bell enters the chat once a week because there’s not much else to enjoy right now so dammit I’m gonna enjoy some nacho cheese once a week). It’s been the hottest sustained summer on record in Phoenix so exercise has been where I fell off but it’s cooling down and gyms reopened and I’m about to get on the fitness train. After the first month of hearing how much worse covid was for people who are obese, and being someone that doesn’t expect people to change their lives in order to save mine, I’m taking matters into my own hands and removing myself as a target.</p>
<p>Imagine how low the US death rate would be if we had a population with the health of Sweden? Just imagine! This should’ve been a wake up call for a lot of people but personal responsibility is hated among many Americans so you’re  going to be fighting this forever. But hey if it could encourage even a fraction of people to better themselves, that’s better than nothing.</p>

        <p>It's fine to treat yourself! Any change in diet must be a complete sustained lifestyle shift in order to produce results, so there's no point imposing something so ascetic on yourself such that it's unsustainable or makes you miserable!</p>
<p>And yeah, the obesity rate in America is 9x that of Japan, for instance. Average weight by person is about 50% less (though obviously Japanese people are shorter on average).</p>

        <p>Nah there’s no truth to that. I’ve seen outdoor workouts and team sports this entire time without any fuss. I even knew people taking turns in other people’s home gyms without issue. AZ closed a few types of public businesses but they’ve completely left people alone for any gatherings under like 250. Hiking was never restricted. It has been the hottest damn summer in a long ass time so I don’t think it would be very wise to workout out in the desert unless it was super early or super late but that’s about all the trouble anyone would’ve gotten into!</p>

        <p>Zero problem with obese people, but studies say they have a significantly higher risk of contracting covid, and taking up healthcare resources.</p>
<p>This is why giving up bodily autonomy and micromanaging behaviour for public health 'good' is a slippery slope.</p>
<p>If it's all about 'saving one life' and 'keeping others safe' then obesity needs shamed, their calories checked, and exercise becomes mandatory to meet certain government weight goals. </p>
<p>In fact, all food for all people needs regulated, exercise comes as a quota, all unhealthy behaviour is outlawed.</p>
<p>If it's for the virus and you care about others you have zero right to complain halfway down the death spiral.</p>
<p>Hmm, seems <em>muh freedoms</em> are more important than we thought.</p>

<p>I hear this sarcastic remark all the time from people now. The fact that anyone ever unironically makes fun of their own freedom is so tragic. I'm not even sure any dystopian novelist ever wrote something that unbelievable, reality is stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>There is a large chunk of logic there.  Which means it could never happen.   </p>
<p>I'm one of those ex-smoker, used to be obsese people who decided to get healthy and am now kind of into health.  So my opinion means nothing.  I am an obnoxious zealot.</p>

        <p>Yup, I like to use this example to shut people up who use the "if it just saves one person" logic, or "if you put yourself at risk of covid, you should have healthcare denied to you!" - okay, everyone needs mandatory exercise until they're at a healthy BMI, and regular updating. Let's also ban fast food and alcohol, for that matter. Smoking too, naturally. All of this would unquestionably save a life - in fact, it would save MANY more lives than covid-19 measures do or would. However, nobody is so keen to go down this route...</p>
<p>Obesity is the real life equivalent of a massive debuff on your player. It screws you up in literally every possible way.</p>

        <p>+1000. I’m fine with obese people, unhealthy lifestyles etc (their choice- none of my business). However, if we are all “responsible for each other’s health” then what next?? Ban fast food so we can “get the death rates down”? I didn’t think any of THIS (current restrictions) would EVER happen...it isn’t much of a stretch to think there will be other things down the road since the precedent is set now.</p>

        <p>Two sets of stairs..indoor and outdoor. Only indoor leads to the garage.  Maybe I should ask him - "have you considered parking outside and taking the outdoor stairway?"</p>

        <p>I always recommend people take the stairs whenever they can - it's what I call "passive exercise". People think fitness and exercise is some herculean effort which leaves you constantly exhausted, when really, it's just a consistent set of incremental efforts!</p>

        <p>Me too. When I was working in office I took the elevator up to the office but only because it was on the 11th floor. I pretty much always took the stairs down. I always took the stairs when going up a few floors though.</p>

        <p>I noticed this too.  I know an obese woman, who has high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes and hypertension,  she likes the lockdown.   She gets super angry and upset when people aren't wearing masks.  If they care about getting sick so much, I would think they would take better care of themselves in the 1st place.  The CDC and Fauci tell people to wear masks, wash your hands, social distance and stay 6 feet apart but, they never encourage people to take personal responsibility and to better their own health.   They should be telling people to eat healthy,  drink water, exercise and to go outside and get vitamin D from the sun.</p>

        <p>He's on a few medications that also negatively affect metabolism, so that has something to do with it, but his lifestyle choices outside of that, i.e. eating and exercise habits, leave a lot to be desired. That prevents me from feeling any sympathy over the metabolism issues that the meds cause, because he's not doing enough to mitigate it on his end. In fact, his lifestyle choices have exacerbated it.</p>

<p>If you are obese, do whatever you can to lose weight. Stop going out to eat. Stop drinking pop. Drink water when you think you're hungry. Walk 2 miles each day. I'm 22 now, and so much happier with my life than I would have if I still weighed that much.</p>
