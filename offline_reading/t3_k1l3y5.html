    <strong>Help me understand!</strong>
    <p><p>Edit: please check out u/bangkokchickboys excellent reply before auto-downvoting, thanks!  </p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I see a lot of funny, passionate, reasonable posts here that address unfair and seemingly interminable lockdowns and resulting personal harm, and loss of livelihoods. I also see a lot of deserved mockery for governments that ignore science-based policy recommendations, and have failed to control covid spread. The overwhelming sentiment is that we all want the circus to end, and go back to living our lives the way we did before.</p>
<p>My problem is that I also see a lot of distrust in the mainstream science (e.g. that masks and social distancing help reduce spread), a lot of dismissive commentary of the general population as ignorant sheep, and a few posts that are pure conspiracy.</p>
<p>I understand the idea of free-thinking skepticism, but I'm not seeing a good basis for some of the claims that are being tossed around here.</p>
<p>So basically, those of you who are against the mask narrative, against lockdowns, etc, can you help me understand why, and what your alternatives are? Can you share some of the evidence that led you to distrust the mainstream narrative?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time, I really appreciate it.</p></p>

        <p>Check out r/lockdownskepticism and maybe sort by top of all time to see the best evidence against most things you're asking about (there's just too much to share in one post). </p>
<p>NoNewNormal is more like the wild wild west and a place for us to vent our frustrations and sometimes wildly speculate things just for fun. </p>
<p>A lot of us are frustrated with the popular sentiment on reddit, MSM, facebook and real life amongst our friends/family and we're sick of having the same arguments over and over again and just need a place to release our pain and frustration and be with other like-minded folk. </p>
<p>Sadly, when we do try to give evidence to pro-lockdowners here, we're met with a lot of catch-phrases, virtue signalling and gaslighting so most people are at their wits end and have no patience to educate those who do not want to listen but just come to argue and call us right-wing, science-denying conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>But if you keep reading the posts here, some studies and papers do make it through and if you read the comments on them, sometimes you'll find doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, virologists etc. who come here and agree with the sentiment (maybe more r/lockdownskepticm than here). This is more like a pub where we come to shoot the shit.</p>
<p>But to give you some idea of the science behind the skepticism, check out these threads that might point you in the right direction:</p>
<p>A doctor who is a lockdown skeptic:</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/jyh47v/i_am_a_physician_who_doubted_lockdown_since_day_1/</p>
<p>A Stanford epidemiologist who is a lockdown skeptic: </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/jcxsb1/ask_me_anything_dr_jay_bhattacharya/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=LockdownSkepticism&amp;utm_content=t5_2iokxd</p>
<p>An Oxford epidemiologist who is a lockdown skeptic: </p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/jvtpwz/ask_me_anything_sunetra_gupta/</p>
<p>A great thread on the best scientific AND philosophical arguments against masks by a regular commenter here: </p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hosvhw/an_updated_critique_of_the_twopronged_idea_that_a/</p>
<p>But for the love of christ, if you (like every other pro-lockdowner who comes here) don't read a single thread I took the time to post and just tell me something like "you don't wear a mask for yourself, you do it to protect others" or some other meaningless slogan, I will not respond any further.</p>
<p>Hope this helps clarify things.</p>
<p>But side note - regardless of the responses you get from your post, we're not bad people here, really. We're just fed up, and this place keeps us sane.</p>

        <p>Thanks for taking the time to write all this out, I genuinely appreciate it! I'll definitely check out the alternate sub you linked.<br>
"<em>NoNewNormal is more like the wild wild west" -</em> no kidding, I did my best to be non-confrontational but still obviously put a few feet wrong. That being said, I've seen some of the vitriol on other posts so I understand a lot of people's gut reaction is a pre-emptive down-vote. That makes your reply all the more special, so thanks again for taking the time, I appreciate it.</p>

        <p>No worries and I feel you. I think if more pro-lockdowners took a more nuanced approached like you did and actually tried to hear us out and tried to meet us somewhere closer to the middle, we wouldn't be so pissed off all time.</p>

        <p>Totally understand you, that post is addressing more to users in the possibilities of a conspiracy - so it's more for the usual users of the conspiracy side. If you are not into this, it's normal to sound like a sinister plot without evidence. 😄</p>
<p>Usually that's how a truth it's searched, by trying all sorts of possibilities, mostly based on evidence but are some that border the non-evidence side and some silly one from noob users entry-level into conspiracy  (we don't condemn them,everyone try their best) and of course there are counter-conspiracies launched by disinformation agencies to make the real conspiracies look fun - to dismiss the real, and cyber teams of bots. So there is quite of things happening in the community itself, because it's dealing with the truth.</p>
<p>That's the only reward we get, the truth. No money, no fame, nothing. Only the truth.</p>
<p>Conspiracies are well defined in the community and are in fact truth and what happened - (rather than the mainstream story).</p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted you to know that "from outside" some conspiracies may sound crazy or silly because you stumble upon a discussion about a possibility - the more "advanced stuff" or a noob entry or some disinfo - but when you actually look at the real ones - that's it.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry to hear that - so you work in public health yourself? Most of the advice I've heard from nurses, doctors locally (Canada) is concern about the number of patients and deaths. What's your experience?</p>

        <p>Life sciences. Their concern is better directed at policymakers for failing to exercise oversight. We spend big money on biodefense every year. I don’t think anybody can be satisfied with what we’ve bought for that money.</p>

        <p>It’s not frustrating. I mean essentially everyone who deals with these people comes to the same conclusion over the period of about a year or so. There is only one way this will go. It’s not like this response is a fluke lol.</p>

        <p>Ok, so...</p>
<p>First off. Maybe masks help reduce the spread of viruses, maybe they don't. I don't care either way, because it's not anyone's business but mine whether or not I wear one.</p>
<p>Same deal with lockdowns. It's not up to you to decide when I leave my house or how many people I invite over. </p>
<p>&rt;"But there's a virus"</p>
<p>So? I should give up on my life because there's a virus? I should just obey this week's bullshit "guidelines" because there's a virus? Do I have to point out how ridiculous this sounds?</p>
<p>It's fun to poke holes in the narrative to put on display the absurdity of it all and to distract myself from lockdown-fueled suicidal thoughts, but make no mistake: it could all be true for all I care, I would still oppose the tyranny, no matter how many viruses there are and how deadly they are.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry that the lockdown has pushed you to suicidal thoughts. Even if I disagree with you on some things, I'd never want anyone to feel that way. Feel free to PM me anytime if you need an anonymous internet person to vent to.</p>
