        <p>"only two more weeks until the end of time"? don't kill yourself, it's a real shame to end life like that of just killing yourself. sometimes things can seem very bad, but if you keep going one day you'll back on those rough periods and it won't seem so bad but a time where you changed and developed as a person. but I sympathise and it's unfortunate to lose your house as it's very important to have a house, where you have your own address where you live. that's an important part of life is you have your address of your home. all sorts of people of all sorts of walks of life need a home, whoever they are whatever they do, maybe they're powerful and own a firm, just like poor people need a home, but everyone needs their own address where they live.</p>

        <p>I dont think you understand.. theres going to be a lot of homeless people for a long time and they wont be able to get any help for a long time because theyre childless men and women.</p>
<p>Being homeless means a loss of dignity and with the post covid19 world society is unwilling to help the poor and homeless. They will just ship them to a city that will "accept" them.</p>

        <p>Generally the collateral from these lockdowns should generate a public outcry when it begins to manifest, and such as a large increase in homelessness measures should be taken against and someone should have to pay for it.</p>
<p>It will be impressive to see if major propaganda organisations can continue to cover up and twist data and achieve misleading the public on the deadliness of the pandemic despite that there will be much research demonstrating the unnecessariness of lockdowns, and we may even end up seeing research pointing to that lockdowns even made the pandemic itself worse by unevenly distributing the load of immunity onto vulnerable. But even if there is very little degree of disagreement it will be interested to see whether organisations such as, for example, CNN, can cover that up. Perhaps most grotesquely they'll instead then work their wizardry of <em>We Were Always at War with Eurasia</em> as if it wasn't such major propaganda outlets who generated such sensationalism and hysteria and created political pressure for lockdowns.</p>
<p>That's the shame is that the people who run an organisation, such as CNN, for example, won't become homeless and they won't pay for what they've done. They'll still have a home. Many of these sorts of people will likely still have multiple homes. Though they'll probably spend most of their time at one home as their primary home, probably a very nice expensive home while the many people they screwed for ratings and political clout have their lives destroyed.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately as long as those organizations such as CNN are the ones who control the narrative they will succeed, they simply just have to put the "big" number of total deaths without time frame or context up and keep screaming "BUT THE VIRUS!!!" over and over and they will win.  We're 100% screwed.</p>

If you had to finance your business opening, you weren't ready to <strong>own</strong> a business, you're just <strong>renting</strong> your job.  Plan, build capital, plan, open business.

        <p>I had a mortgage for 3 years, paid off early. The mortgage was less than rent in my city.  Negotiate, buy cheap, pay in cash.  If you make 2 incomes, learn to live on one most the time.  If you make shit money, find a new job.  If rent is too high where you live, move somewhere you can afford, then save up and <strong>buy</strong> (in cash)!</p>

        <p>Who's business has been shut down for 6 months and where?  We're not in China.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Back to my original comment.  I said back in January (after Wuhan's 11 million people were locked down) that the US needed to stop ALL flights 9/11 style,  test any suspected travelers/cases, quarantine and contact trace like crazy.  It would have taken at most a 6-8 week shutdown and we'd have some control over this virus and an economy that was more-or-less working as normal.  Cases would be low.  The threat to your average American would remain low.  Those words were said, but there was <strong>NO</strong> follow-through.  Coronavirus is like cancer, catch it early or it will wreck you [your 'normal' life].</p>

<p>The shitty part about this virus is it is <em>just</em> deadly/debilitating enough for such a response.  Lockdowns would be unlikely/unnecessary if we had clear messaging on the seriousness of this virus's complications, masks, basic hygiene and distancing from day one.</p>

        <p>You could look at it that way. Or, you could look at it as getting rich while risking somebody else's money.</p>
<p>Also, even if you are not financing it with debt, you still have contracts and expenses. Having basic operating expenses is not being over leveraged. How are you supposed to plan for the government completely shutting the economy down and making your business "temporarily" illegal? It has never happened before EVER, and until now, why would you even remotely think it could happen?</p>
