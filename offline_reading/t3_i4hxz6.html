<p>They built the entire tech industry as you know today.</p>
<h1>THEN THEY WERE ALL FIRED.</h1>
<p>looking for tech jobs today is depressing.. do you have 20 years sr level exp?  we have the job for you.</p>

        <p>Oh man, don't get me started on the cultural difference regarding attitudes towards work...</p>
<p>It's super frustrating seeing everything going to shit while nobody else cares because it's all about superficial things that please the managers as opposed to delivering a good product.  One of the smartest people I've met got laid off before me because he also cared and brought the concerns to the managers.  "Do what you are told and never question anything anyone above you says", even if you know it will result in failure.</p>
<p>I know not all companies are like this but from walking around, it seems like that is the inevitable outcome.  I've been super jaded and was hoping for Covid hysteria to blow over before going back but it doesn't seem like that will never happen.  I don't have the discipline to WFH I guess and I also liked the social aspect of going to work.</p>

        <p>The only thing that matters is shipping in time and not raising attention to yourself.  Not everyone is like that but the ones who rise to the top are the ass-kissers who just focus on playing the game.</p>
<p>The managers I knew were mostly individual contributors though.</p>
<p>When I first started working it was like being in college with people that were fun to be around.  It really started when people stopped speaking English in lieu of one other particular language you probably can guess.</p>

        <p>The problem I don't see mentioned enough with remote learning is that in school you learn a lot of "soft skills" which are necessary for the workplace and life in general. If you're studying remotely, how can you learn skills like public speaking, groupwork/leadership/management, social skills and independence? Missing out on maths, science etc will create loads of problems, but at the same time young people are being programmed to have incredibly low emotional intelligence.</p>

        <p>So as it turns out that CDC report was heavily influenced by the White House which might explain why the CDC suddenly started pushing for schools to open and why they dont bring up any of the concerns about opening schools like if the children dont follow safety guidelines cuz they're children and dont listen</p>
