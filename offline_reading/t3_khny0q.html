    <strong>With the madness of draconian lockdowns coming up, I thought I’d “follow the science”</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full</p>
<p>The conclusion really stands out:</p>
<p>“Covid-19 has prompted a wide range of responses from governments around the world, yet the contagion and mortality curves are very homologous among countries (33). This is reinforced by our findings regarding the lack of any association with the government's actions taken during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In that sense, the determining demographic, health, development, and environment factors seem much more important to anticipate the lethal consequences of the Covid-19 than government's actions, especially when such actions are led by political goals more than by sanitary ones.”</p></p>

        <p>One example: Florida. Now DeSantis is trying to keep down their numbers by saying "If you call X a CoVid-19 death, it had better be damned near directly a CoVid-19 death!" and not pushing the PCR tests but I think at the end of things, we will see that Florida's numbers are the closest to accurate in the nation.</p>
<p>I happen to loathe Florida's politicians for some very good reasons, including their harassment of homosexuals, females trying to get abortions, etc. but in this scamdemic? They have done the correct things.</p>

        <p>For the first time in my life, I have found myself praising GOP governors. Never thought the day would come. Now if only they catch up to the issues you mentioned.</p>

        <p>It’s unfortunate because I just don’t see the lockdowns ending anytime soon unless there is a mass rebellion, which hopefully will happen with more people seeing it’s never going to end unless they make it end. At least in the US a lot of the people are still armed and half the country is unlikely to go along with a nationwide shutdown easily.</p>
