    <strong>Anyone else who is vaccinated themselves but are against any kind of mandates?</strong>
    <p><p>So I decided to get the vaccine, but it’s because I decided the benefits outweigh the risks for myself personally. </p>
<p>I also realize that this is NOT the same for everyone across the board and that this is a decision that should be left to each individual and that no one should be forced or coerced into taking something that they aren’t comfortable with. </p>
<p>Most other vaccinated people I’ve talked to always whine and moan to me about the “antivaxxers” and think mandating the vaccine is a great idea, but when I tell them my thoughts they look almost physically uncomfortable around me. </p>
<p>It’s all just so tiresome.</p></p>

        <p>I have absolutely no problem with other people <em>choosing</em> to get the vaccine.  Both my mother and my brother have been vaccinated for example.</p>
<p>The issue is when they start saying <em>everyone</em> needs to get vaccinated.  That doesn't make any sense.  </p>
<p>Or, how they will say we are a "danger" to society by not getting vaccinated.  There is apparently a leap in logic here where otherwise rational human beings believe "unvaccinated" suddenly also means "infected".</p>
<p>But if you think about it logically.  Unvaccinated does not automatically mean infected.  And since it doesn't, what the hell are we even talking about!?</p>
<p>"Get away from me!  You haven't had your vaccine yet!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but <em>I don't have the virus.</em> How can you get a virus from me that I don't even have!?  Plus, aren't <em>you</em> vaccinated!?  How can you get a virus I don't have from me for which you are vaccinated??"</p>
<p>(This is usually the point in the conversation when another cult member joins in to protect the herd)</p>
<p>"YOU ARE A RACIST!  REEEEEEEEE!!"</p>
<p>We are dealing with a cult here.</p>

        <p>They usually virtue signal for the people who are unable to get the vaccine due to medical issues or whatever. </p>
<p>But at the same time I keep hearing them say that there <em>aren’t</em> any medical reasons that people can’t get vaccinated so I don’t get it honestly.</p>

        <p>I got the J&amp;J shot because I am at a higher risk group (obese) and I was not comfortable getting the mRNA shit. I mean shot.</p>
<p>I would never mandate that someone gets vaccinated. You would never force a medical treatment on someone who was capable of making their own decisions. </p>
<p>I will not be vaccinating my children. They are not at risk for getting severely ill. I also do not make them wear masks. Masks on children are virtue signaling at best. I do not want my children to think that this is normal by any means. They are the normal ones for not wearing one.</p>

        <p>This is not necessarily directed at you, but a common misconception about J&amp;J is that there isn’t mRNA which is true, because it’s DNA. You’re still making the spike protein but from DNA, which is then transcripted to RNA then translated into spike protein. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine.html">source</a> </p>
<p>It seems like this isn’t common info, ex <a href="https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/what-you-need-know-about-johnson-johnson-vaccine">here</a> it says 
&rt;The J&amp;J vaccine (also called the Johnson &amp; Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) uses an inactivated cold virus to carry <strong>genetic material,</strong> which prompts your cells to create a harmless piece of the “spike protein” found on the surface of COVID-19. This helps the body build an immune response against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. These types of vaccines have been around for years and are generally safe for large populations of people.
…
&rt;Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not use inactive virus. Rather, they use <strong>genetic material (called mRNA)</strong> to instruct the cells in your body to make the same spike protein. “Once the spike protein is created, the vaccines work essentially the same way,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s still genetic material making the spike protein.</p>

        <p>100%. I <em>chose</em> to get vaccinated because of international travel, and I am simply unable to fight the machine at this point. For me, the risks were acceptable. I respect everyone’s right to do as they please, and I would be MORE than happy if everyone just shut the fuck up about their vaccine “status”, because the creeping normality is creating an us vs them world. </p>
<p>I think we are on a dangerous path with mandates, and the level of comfort with authoritarian measures, two-tiered society, and literal systemic discrimination over what is a private health issue. It’s terrifying.</p>

        <p>I have a friend whose workplace is literally buying “VacSeen” wrist bands for vaccinated employees. </p>
<p>No one is required to be vaccinated at this point, but I feel like this will create totally unnecessary division in the work environment and could coerce people into getting it who wouldn’t feel comfortable doing so otherwise. </p>
<p>Which breaks my heart if I’m honest.</p>

        <p>This is the crux of the issue. I suspect that for those happily going along with the division of society are not in it for money or power, but status. It will be made law that the vaccinated are our betters and they will lap it up.</p>

        <p>Reading studies and talking to others about their experiences, mostly. </p>
<p>Not gonna lie I definitely was hesitant at first, but eventually decided that it was a risk I was willing to take. Thankfully I didn’t experience any severe side effects like some do. </p>
<p>Again, this is only my personal experience and I definitely understand people’s hesitancy toward it. I realize it’s not the same for everyone and think that it should be up to the individual on whether they want to take it or not. This means I’m also against any kind of vaccine mandate from schools, employers, or otherwise. </p>
<p>I’m 27 btw.</p>

If you want to get the vaccine, cool. If not that’s ok too. It is a personal choice and should not be forced</p>

        <p>I got the vaccine and hate the restrictions. I honestly got the vaccine mainly because of not being shunned where I live and so I can participate in society. Not for actual health reasons. I really don’t care if people have it or not.</p>

        <p>I got the vaccine because I will have to travel for work eventually so I decided to get it while I still had the choice instead of being forced. However,  I am in my 50s and past childbearing years.  I did advise my daughter and her husband to NOT get it since we still don't know what it does to the reproductive system and they have not had children yet.  If I didnt already forsee issues with my job, I wouldn't have gotten it.</p>

        <p>That's because you're the minority of vaxxers. You're going to find opposition with your current mindset because it oposses the agenda.   <br>
This isn't about freedom and having the right to choose anymore, it's about control. The government has gone through great lengths to pit people against eachother. IE your mask protects me, your vaccine protects me, and if you're not wearing your mask or getting your vaccine then you must not care about other people. Here we have always had the mindset of wear YOUR mask and get YOUR vaccine if YOU want to.</p>

        <p>I talk to a lot of ppl at my work (bartender, in San Diego), and have only had probably 2 out of the 50 who have told me they had the vax actually care that I wasn’t getting it. I never lie when someone asks, I say I’m never going to get it because I already hate shots and am not scared of the virus, and almost everyone has understood and been cool with it. The two people who tried to convince me had no logical argument and I just walked away from as they got more and more mad at my reasonable responses. Even here in Commifornia, it seems like most are against any passports.</p>

        <p>My biggest holdout is the fact that prior infected individuals are still coerced into getting a vaccine. If I hadn’t gotten covid up until now, I would probably get one. I don’t like the government advertising and shoving it down my throat all while ignoring BIO 101 of the VERY BASICS of your immune system.</p>

        <p>Yes I’m in exactly the same boat. I waited for a while and took my time making the decision. I couldn’t care less what you or anyone else decides to do in relation to this or any vaccine.</p>
<p>I’ve actually been called an anti vaxxer for expressing my opinions about those who want to mandate it. Despite having had it 🤦‍♂️</p>
<p>The problem isn’t the vaccine - it’s an amazing achievement, they’re effective enough to put an end to this and no doubt have saved a lot of lives. The problem is the militant assholes who want to force everyone to have it. We should have just got them in the arms of as many 60-70+ year olds as possible, opened up fully and left it available to anyone else who wants it - if they do. There should never have been any questions, hysterical tribal nonsense or all the horrific propaganda. Just “here you go, it’s there if you want it, no biggie”</p>

        <p>Quite a refreshing change to see this approach, you decided to do it, but respect that others may not want to. </p>
<p>Reading comment on news sites is very disheartening, people are fine with those not wanting to get "the jab" being ostracised and have their daily lives made more difficult with restrictions. </p>
<p>I've not had it yet and I'm in no hurry to, I'm following what's happening and looking up what I want to know, rather than rely on the news to tell me what they think I should know. </p>
<p>I know I'll have to get it at some point because I love to travel, but while that's all up in the air and inconsistent at the moment, I'll just sit back and watch what's going on. I'm not antivax, I've had many for travel and had all the ones you get as a child, but this is different.</p>

        <p>I got the J&amp;J vaccine through my wife’s work back in December. I got it mostly because I travel for work and I didn’t want to get sick on the road or take it home to the family. I definitely think high risk people should get it but anyone else who isn’t at high risk should evaluate based on their own circumstances and decide accordingly. I don’t believe a mandate for this is right.</p>

        <p>I agree. Everybody's health is their own personal responsibility. The fact that has become a political statement is pretty scary.</p>

        <p>I was on the fence in regards to the vaccine. I did end up getting it. I do not plan to get it again, nor do I plan to get any boosters. I will not allow my children to get it. I don't think there should be any incentives tied to getting it, nor do I think anyone choosing to not get it should be denied any services offered to those who are vaccinated (tickets, etc.)</p>

        <p>I just think if the Canadian government will (try to) force us to get whatever drug they import from whatever big pharma because of safety, they can force us to do whatever they want for the "good of society". I think I remember a larger country that Canada simps for made some sort of child mandate? Something about only one allowed? Where they sterilize or abort anyone they deemed ineligible? Maybe it's apples and oranges, but where does the line get drawn before Canadians snap out of it?</p>

        <p>Same. I got it with no hesitation. I was looking forward to it. I never thought COVID was “nbd” <em>for me personally</em>. I tend to have abnormal reactions to viral infections that do not match my age and general health. I did not want to be sickest I’ve ever been for ten days. I took my kids outside and to trusted homes every day this whole time, but I did stop working for several months to lower my risk and the risk for my elderly parents who could not bear to be apart from me and the kids. </p>
<p>I had been following mRNA development for years due to their potential for cancer treatment. I understood how they worked and knew of their potential for pandemics prior to COVID. </p>
<p>The only thing that made me opt for Johnson &amp; Johnson was the initial reports of anaphylactic reactions in the other two. (I have an anaphylactic food allergy.) I am PRO vaccine by CHOICE and believe it is beneficial for the elderly and high risk. I am AGAINST any child or teen getting it unless they’re a cancer patient. </p>
<p>All that being said, I have been against lockdowns and mask mandates since May of last year. We believed in focused protection in our family. Not shutting down society because elderly people who can barely leave their rooms anyway might be higher risk.</p>

        <p>I vaccinated myself with first dose to not have to do covid tests each time I travel back home to see my family. I have anxiety and I am afraid of false positives. If it wasn't for travel, I wouldn't get the vaccine. I am against it and against governments making life difficult for people without vaccine.</p>

        <p>I'm not getting the vaccine, but I'm in the same position as you on it. If you decide to get it, fine by me. If it's because the benefits outweigh the risks for you, good decision. If it's because of peer pressure and blind trust, bit of a stupid decision imo but not my problem. I'm not against the vaccine, I'm against any kind of mandates. I'm sick of seeing the two extremes on this topic, can't we all agree to just mind our own business and make our own decisions on this?</p>

        <p>I got it because my mom could die from a cold. I would be fine. But didnt want to risk my mom as she is the best parent. She got the shot too. My dad doesnt want to get it dispite also being in his seventies and a cancer survivor. Good thing thier divorced. I did my own reserch as i was also skeptical about the vaccine but also decided it was worth the risk. Dig the masks it been great for alergies and didnt get sick with the office bug like i do every year. Plus in winter it kept my face warm.</p>
