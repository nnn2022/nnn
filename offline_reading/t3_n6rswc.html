    <strong>Denial and sunk cost fallacy</strong>
    <p><p>As a woman, this thread freaks me the fuck out: https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/n68ow8/has_anyone_who_has_had_menstruation_changes_post</p>
<p>EDIT: New post today, it just keeps on coming https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/n6ydih/has_anyone_experienced_an_unusual_period_from_the/</p>
<p>More than 50% of women on these threads (probably more though) report a screwed up period, and then say "at least I didn't get covid!!!1111" or chalk it up to "anxiety" and even literally inventing things like <em>this means it's working</em>.</p>
<p>Damn it's so sad people don't view their bodies as sacred anymore and fall for this propagandized money making shit. </p>
<p>It has to be sunk cost fallacy. People can't admit they were wrong or that sacrificing their body for science (literally) in this case was not in their best interest.</p></p>

        <p>At this point we are far enough into this that I’m not even going to have conversations with people about this.  Now we find out that Johnson and Johnson is funding fact check.org which is silencing people who discuss anything but sunshine and rainbows regarding these vaccines. The time will come where we won’t be viewed as conspiracy theorists but right now we are taking a very difficult road. A lot of people that are taking the vaccine refuse to listen to anything negative, that’s their problem. I was even lied to by one of my doctors and told that this was approved by the FDA and clinical trials were completed. When I challenged her she kept asking me where I heard this information and she kept saying it was false. I’m just done with these people. If they want to live in their fantasy land they can go right ahead. They will eventually be sorry and I don’t have any sympathy for people who try to shame me and call me names for not wanting to take an experimental injection that isn’t even approved by the FDA with no long-term data.</p>

        <p>I've heard them say it on mainstream news channels that it's FDA approved. This is blatant misinformation that they would kick and scream at us for. It's not FDA approved at all yet. Emergency authorization is a totally different beast.</p>

        <p>I guess I am wondering at point will they wake up? Maybe when a whistleblower comes out and exposes it beyond a shadow of a doubt? Something tells me they will explain ANYTHING horrible happening to their bodies as a result of this poison as "anxiety effects" or just "temporary"....</p>

        <p>I think a lot of them probably won't. Or maybe they will when the food is on their neck and they don't like it. I remember watching that video that everyone has probably watch by now with Yuri bezmenov talking about communist subversion. There is one step in the process where he says you can present people with evidence clear as day, proof right in front of them and they will still deny what they're seeing. We are at that point right now.</p>
