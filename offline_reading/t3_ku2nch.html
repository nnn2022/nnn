    <strong>Virtual learning is a disaster.</strong>
    <p><p>Are any students out there thriving in a virtual/remote learning environment? All of my kids have regressed horribly this school year. This has been immensely frustrating as a parent. I don’t see how this can possibly be a sustainable model for education.</p></p>

        <p>Do you ever just feel depressed when you're in a lecture and you just see people in their boxes with either their lone faces or just a name and a dark screen? College life is devoid of engagement and meaning without being in person. Last year I was a college freshman and the contrast between my experience now and then is agonizing.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m a college freshman now so this is what my college experience is and honestly I just feel nothing towards it. I don’t look back in the last semester fondly I made no new friends and I just got to a point where I turned off my camera and mic and just listens with my feet up on my desk here at home. I did have a few in person classes but that was like one to two times a week and even that varied. One day in my mass media class the class was split up into different zoom sessions and my group didn’t even talk about what we we’re supposed to be doing we just talked about how big of a failure online learning is. The only class I can remember anything from is my King Arthur course but that’s because I liked King Arthur in the first place and my teacher was one of the best I’d ever had. But other then that I learned next to nothing</p>

        <p>My daughter is in 7th grade and she is actually doing better academically now that we are distance learning. She’s learning all the subjects and her grades have improved. My son is in 3rd grade and mostly learning math. The first month was kind of bad as the kids weren’t used to distance learning and a lot of time was wasted trying to get them to focus and do the work. My sons class starts out with a google meeting where they share things and socialize and then they do a short writing assignment and then spend hours on math. After lunch the teacher reads a story and sometimes there is a short science assignment-usually to watch a video and answer questions. My son really isn’t getting much of an education and there are way too many distractions, he’s starting to get angry really easy and sitting in front of the computer for hours is really not working for him. He’ll sit there alright but every time I look up, he’s either laying across the chair not paying attention to the teach or he’s playing with toys! My daughters teachers don’t really communicate much. I get a weekly auto generated email that tells me what assignments were missing and what is on the next weeks schedule but only one of her teacher has ever sent out an email about anything. My sons teacher communicates regularly. But he needs to be back in the classroom with his classmates.</p>

        <p>Lol that's so true. One of my students told me all the ways they use to cheat in virtual tests. I asked if she didn't care about cheating (she's normally a very good student, never breaking rules), she said "everyone is doing it, if i didn't i would fall behind.  And who cares anyway, i just want to get through it"</p>
<p>Kids totally stopped caring if they learn anything or not</p>

        <p>My son is doing good with it because there is so much less work. It isn't a good learning environment whatsoever, but at least we don't have that added stress. The real problem is that none of us can be home so we have to pay a "daycare" to make sure he does his classes and schoolwork. He's 10 and has ADD, so he's not responsible at all.</p>

        <p>"Homeschooling" is often better than the "schooling" that the government offers. There are so many free resources on the internet for reading/writing/arithmetic that you can take advantage of.  You can totally do homeschooling and have such a better experience!  It's just an adjustment but keep at it :)</p>

        <p>Here it didn't cause a drop in grades at all.... because we just lowered all the thresholds to pass because the kids were doing terribly. But on paper it looks great!</p>

        <p>I’m a college student and I’ve been doing better than I was on campus, but I’ve also always been pretty good at teaching myself when I have to and I have more time and energy to work since I’m home. I have 4 younger siblings at home, 3 in online school, and they’re doing okay-ish since they have me and our mom around most of the time to help/keep them accountable if they need it, and they go to schools that have handled it decently, but it just doesn’t compare to them being in actual school. Overall I’d say online learning could be better for some college students, but for kids it doesn’t come close to having personal interactions with teachers and students.</p>

        <p>In college and it is a disaster. I join zoom lectures and instead of listening to a mind numbingly boring and noninteractive speech (zoom lectures are basically low quality podcasts), I just play video games or do chores. I have a difficult time paying attention online... the interactive nature of an in person class kept me focused and engaged but that is gone now. I'd literally rather listen to nap inducing morning NPR than do more online classes.</p>

        <p>We've had a positive experience with virtual learning. The teachers have been great at communicating and staying in touch with us and the kids actually engage. They arent on one, continuous meeting, it's 2 to 3 a day with independent work between. No regression here, but every parent/school district/kid is different. 1st and 3rd graders.</p>

        <p>Really depends on the kid, their age,  and their temperament and learning style IMO. </p>
<p>6th grade son: doing great with DL, prefers distance learning days to in-school days (his school is hybrid) better grades than ever, and he likes sleeping in and having the extra free time. Sees friends plenty at sports. He’s a quieter, introverted but happy kid. </p>
<p>6th grade daughter: hates DL days but is doing fine. Grades are fine (same as before, maybe a bit lower), but she is SUPER social and extroverted so it’s hard for her. She is MUCH more engaged and focused when learning in person.</p>
<p>4th grade son: is back in school full time, thank goodness. Had such a horrible time with distance learning I almost pulled him out and homeschooled. His (normally great) grades suffered and so did his temperament and feelings about school. He’s been back in school for 2mos and is back to his happy self (and grades back to normal). Mostly reflects his age- I think very few elementary aged kids are able to do distance learning with any success. There will always be exceptions.</p>

        <p>They changed the scoring method of kids being graded to "celebrating what they know".  So it doesn't matter at all what the kids actually learn.  It also let's the teachers off from being accountable as to "why are all your students failing?"</p>
<p>There was an article that the teacher union still supports 94% staying virtual.  What a joke.</p>
<p>I can't wait to leave this liberal cesspool city.</p>

        <p>In the midst of a massive crisis of overproduction of goods, capitalists are looking to cut their expenses. Education and healthcare, from the point of view of the private owners of the means of production, are unnecessary expedintures. So the situation will only get worse.</p>
