    <strong>Is anyone seeing any real life examples of ADE yet?</strong>
    <p><p>I know three people who have died due to suspected adverse vaccine reactions (within 3 weeks of receiving vaccine, were on a continuous decline after receiving vaccine until demise) Not necessarily ADE. My social circle isn’t even that big and most of my friends are not even vaccinated at all...yet 3 people dead?! Crazy. There’s no sure way to say the vaccine is what did them in w/o and autopsy (none was done), but it sure is mighty suspicious that these formerly healthy people died in short order and the vaccine needs to be considered a <em>possible</em> source. </p>
<p>My boyfriend’s father has got a bad, mega <em>aggressive</em> case of the shingles since taking the vaccine. Could be ADE, could be a coincidence, could be unrelated, but still interesting to note. </p>
<p>I’m curious to hear about your own experiences. Might be too early for serious ADE emergence, but maybe there’s something out there.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, two family friends (close friends of my mom) have passed away. One was a male in his 50s with no pre-existing conditions. Admitted to hospital about 36 hours after the second Pfizer dose with heart pain. Died about 12 hours later from a heart attack. Second was a woman in her early 60s who had an aneurysm within 2 weeks of the second Pfizer shot.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry for your mom’s friend. My mom’s BFF died too from vaxx reaction and my (thankfully!) unvaxxed mom has been inconsolable.</p>
<p>I admit I’m no expert and my question was unclear. From my understanding, ADE is something that happens after re-exposure to pathogens, the host’s immune system over reacts to whatever threat and they become much sicker than they otherwise would have had they not received the vaccine. </p>
<p>These sound like vaccine related deaths, but not ADE. The only suspected ADE in my small circle is boyfriend’s dad’s shingles. </p>
<p>Have you noticed anyone consistently sick after getting the vaccine?</p>

        <p>I’m sorry. I seriously think the people who have been damaged in this way will become the most outspoken opponents against it in the near future. Please dont let the fear get to you and consider speaking out about it.</p>

        <p>I think that we need to distinguish between ADE (ie, body's immune system in hyperdrive to fight off an infection it can't because it's been primed to a certain pathogen) and the syndrome of reactions that the Jehovaxx Witnesses call "That means it's working."</p>
<p>Shingles, heart attacks, strokes, etc are definitely in the latter group. I think that we'll only start to see ADE in the autumn/winter when the vaxxed are exposed to circulating coronaviruses (ie, the common cold).</p>

        <p>It's a bit early for widespread ADE emergence, although Israel was reporting a lot of bad colds and flus after their vaxx campaign was pretty much finished: https://www.jpost.com/health-science/covid-19-might-be-over-but-viral-infections-in-israel-are-surging-671354</p>
