    <strong>We Can Never Return To Normality</strong>
    <p><p>Even if we manage to contain or eradicate this virus through vaccinations, we can never return to normality. Not fully. Not anymore. Not with the way things are headed.</p>
<p>Because a very dangerous precedent has been set, one that allows those in power to enact lockdowns at a moment's whim, to take away your rights and freedoms, all in the name of collectively combatting some deadly disease, viral virus, or pestilent plague that kills less than 1% of the population. And if you don't comply or even just voice grievances you are a sociopathic, monstrous, scythe-wielding granny-assassin with no regard for human life. Probably a right-wing Republican-Tory conspiracy theorist tinfoil twat, too.</p>
<p>Through your virtue-signalling, narcissism and fear-mongering over social media you have allowed this to happen. You're so obsessed with the present you have fucked our future and erased our past. Most of you don't even defend your actions or words when labelled a "Nazi", because you have no defense. You can only parrot back meaningless buzzwords and patronising phrases like the infected masses in "Pontypool".</p>
<p>Or just straight up wish death upon us and our families for daring to complain. Y'know, because you're so dedicated to saving lives and all. You're all fucking brainwashed drones, completely lacking independent thought. You went from actively wishing death on "boomers", to "pRoTeCt tHe eLdErlY aT aLL cOsTs!!!11" in nothing flat.</p>
<p>If we carry on down this path the new normal will become our reality. We will never see our friends or families again; grandma and grandpa will eventually die from something other than COVID and you won't care. You won't have seen them in fucking years anyway. You'll have disassociated yourself emotionally from them.</p>
<p>These fucking masks and lockdowns have left deep psychological scars, too. Anxiety-riddled hypochondriacs will make up the majority of society, and we will have to cater to them, because we care so fucking much and that's the kind of society we live in. These face-masks aren't going away. In fact, a lot of insane cunts idly fantasize about it. But sure, if we wear the masks (which don't work by the way) they'll go away eventually, keep repeating that.</p>
<p>Where will the madness end? When we're living in hermetically-sealed chambers, gobbling up Soylent Green, watching re-edited versions of films where the actors have been digitally distanced and masked, and, for the lucky few who had partners before this whole mess started, fucking with face-masks on for the sole purpose of procreation? Think that's a stretch? Check out the BBC article instructing you on how best to FUCK during this super serious pandemic.</p>
<p>The measures and restrictions will only get more ridiculous with time, because you can't cheat death. People die every day. That's life. But that's become an unacceptable reality to these people. It is fucking unreasonable to expect us to care this much with no end or hope in sight. Fuck the carrot and stick approach: they've shoved a fucking log the size of a caterpillar cake up our ass and eaten the fucking carrot right in front of us.</p></p>

        <p>Good rant. I'm afraid you're right, too many people lack common sense and critical thinking skills. Maybe this is the future we deserve for taking our freedom for granted and giving it up so easily.</p>

        <p>This will stop when people stop complying.  Everyone always says they‚Äôre waiting for ‚Äúpeople‚Äù to do something.  Since you, me, and everyone else on this sub are part of that group called ‚Äúpeople‚Äù, it‚Äôs time for us to stop following the rules.</p>
<p>Stop wearing your mask, go see your friends and family, and if some branch covidian confronts you about it either ignore them or tell them to fuck off.  Those people are usually weak cowards anyway so they‚Äôll back away if you get even slightly aggressive.</p>

        <p>Just act normal in public. </p>
<p>I live in California, it's riddled with neurotic authoritarians. The cheat code for these types is all they really care about is social status, they don't have any concrete values or beliefs.</p>
<p>If you are fit, attractive, have nicer things than them, or have more confidence than them, or even are just having a good time, they will follow you. Often when I talk to people they take their mask off at some point. </p>
<p>Very few people actually like this shit, they are just cowards and don't want to stand out or get mean looks. Give them an example to follow.</p>
<p>The only people I have met that are very staunch maskers in social settings are obese people, or some lonely weirdos in the corner. No one wants to emulate that.</p>
<p>The internet isn't real, and it doesn't matter what people think when they don't leave their home.</p>
<p>Europe is an out of control dystopia, these rules don't apply. My condolences.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve always wanted to have kids, but now I just think about the world they would be raised in. If something doesn‚Äôt drastically change, if we don‚Äôt stand up and take back our lives, I can‚Äôt justify bringing someone into this world. Not how it is now. Time for a revolution. If we fight back, they will back down.</p>
