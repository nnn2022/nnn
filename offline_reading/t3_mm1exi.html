        <p>It's not about the masks. If you can't understand that you're a dumbass. It's about the precedent of semi-permanent public health measures for situations that aren't anywhere near crisis level based on CDC info. Age adjusted death rates at 2003 levels do not call for invasive mandates, they call for isolating the sick and elderly.</p>

        <p>&rt; "a clearer understanding that both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission are possible – even common"   </p>
<p>this is thoroughly debunked by now</p>
<p>&rt; "The first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points."</p>
<p>Despite mask mandates, cases were STILL GROWING.</p>
<p>CDC's own study showed mask mandates had NEGLIGIBLE impact.</p>
<p>But these are both flawed, because the only evidence for the studies uses PCR testing, which is not medically diagnostic and cannot determine if someone is sick, immune, contagious, or anything else.  So the data for all of these studies is completely meaningless, even if, on a population level, you control for testing volume and strategy, which wasn't done.  (On top of it, this was all done last summer, before those same masked states all showed the same seasonal case increases as unmasked states.)</p>
<p>Any datasets based on PCR as a proxy for sick are simply wrong.  Do some research on what PCR does, how it works, and what it means.  Start with a bio 101 textbook (swing by, I have a stack in my office downstairs), this isn't rocket science.</p>

        <ul>
<li>
<p>There are downsides to wearing masks, if you do not consider these along with any possible benefits, you're not making rational decisions.  This is why we have lockdowns killing and harming more people than they're helping.  If you are not aware of the negative aspects of mask wearing, I addressed some in my initial post, and there are others.  Look up impacts on kids' developing brains, look up dentists' objections, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not have any widely deployed method to determine if someone who isn't sick has covid, and even for patients who are sick, we just just PCR in a hospital setting,  Cultures are not run, imagery is only considered for the minuscule portion of the population that has a severe experience.  This means that studies are almost exclusively using PCR as a proxy for "infected" or "sick", and the data is thus of extremely poor quality.  Most just use raw numbers from covidtrackingproject or john's hopkins, thus not even bothering with how many tests were run to produce those positives, or whether testing focused on the symptomatic, or included weekly student testing.  Basically, garbage in, garbage out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is slowing the spread of a disease helpful?  Hospitals are not, and were NEVER more taxed than during a severe flu season. (ask cuomo, hospitals were "never overwhelmed"!)  We used essentially none of our emergency facilities, compared to the hospital tents in 2018.  Most age-stratified epidemiological models demonstrate you want the healthy young population be exposed early and often because they're the ones that drive spread.  Once they're mostly exposed, the likelihood of the fringe populations (think: elderly) being exposed goes DOWN.  If masks and lockdowns had much impact, it would quite probably result in more fatalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's still no evidence that mask mandates or wearing have impacted case, icu, mortality, or excess mortality rates, despite numerous state-to-state, country-to-country, and temporal comparisons.  Cases, and similarly icu and covid fatalities are all subject to the same PCR-compromised counting, but total mortality is not.  (Nor excess mortality, but there are weird arbitrary calculations for what constitutes excess, how many years of trend data are used, etc.  It's a good attempt to account for health context (mortality displacement, harvesting, etc) but as with any spiky data, you're not going to have the complete story for at least a couple years after an event.)</p>

<p>2) antigen tests see if you have reactive antibodies, which don't surface for a longer time after exposure, and linger for months or years.  it would be a fair assessment of disease prevalence if properly sampled (which it isn't) but doesn't tell if you someone is sick, or was sick, or was immune</p>
<p>3) hospitals are doing fine, we can study it anyway, and slowing the disease is likely to kill more people even if you don't take the horrific impacts of the lockdowns in to account.  </p>
<p>4) page not loading, probably due to blocked cookies, but meh.</p>
<p>) this virus was always political, the WHO built this PCR protocol (based on the corman-drosten paper) specifically in order to make this dramatic, just as with the 2009 swine flu scam, when Drosten (and Fauci!) again drummed up fear, the WHO redefined pandemic to make swine flu match, a vaccine was rushed, people were hurt, etc.  The behavior and main actors (german gov't among them) are quite surprising when you look in to it.   I suggest you follow the work of Dr Reiner Fuellmich, the lawyer that went after Deutsche Bank and VW, he's now investigating the WHO and german authorities and has a ton of data and documents.  Lawyers are not known for careless talk :)</p>

        <p>1) </p>
<p>"Upon our critical review of the available literature, we found only weak evidence for wearing a face mask as an efficient hygienic tool to prevent the spread of a viral infection."  </p>
<p>"Our critical evaluation of the literature both highlights the protective effects of certain types of face masks in defined risk groups, and emphasizes their potential risks."</p>
<p>If YOU are afraid and have a quality mask, you can wear it and it may, if worn correctly, washed, etc., provide some protection to YOU.  Given N95s were designed SOLELY to protect the wearer, this makes sense.  This has nothing to do with "slowing the spread", but targeted protection of vulnerable people.  Now go look at what it takes to get and maintain a quality seal with an N95 and the related OSHA particle-counting testing.  I've done this for years, and if you're clean shaven and don't move, you can reach that 95% target protection.  If you talk or move your neck, you're screwed :)</p>
<p>2) the ability of pcr or antigen tests to tell you if you're sick has NOTHING to do with the conditions in which the tests are held, they're simply not measuring "sick."  it isn't what pcr does. it isn't what antigen does.  you can be completely immune from a past exposure to sars-cov-2 or something else and STILL TEST POSITIVE.  this is the same with ANY disease.</p>
<p>3) I'll try again.  The primary spreaders of respiratory diseases are active, healthy youth and young adults in the 15-35 range.  They have wide, dense, social networks that reach both above and below in age, are less likely to isolate from their milder symptoms, more physically active (increased emissions), and more likely to touch (everything from handshakes to intimate). Kids don't have wide enough networks, elderly don't have wide networks nor frequent close contact.  If you want to slow a disease, you get as many of those 15-35 sick or vaccinated as quickly as possible, and the disease can no longer spread effectively.  If you slow their exposure, the disease will still be in broad circulation for much longer, increasing the chance that an interaction with a vulnerable individual will include transmission.  The usual age-stratified transmission models all reinforce this concept.  It's also the entire idea behind herd immunity (you know, before the WHO redefined it), whereby you want to have a large exposed portion of the population to protect the vulnerable.  Reaching that (soft) threshold quickly, as long as our resources aren't overwhelmed, conveys protection faster than any other method.  Given the mode case from this population is a negligible health event, exposing them all at the same time is unlikely to cause any more trouble than a normal, uncontrolled flu season, which impacts this group MORE than covid does.</p>

        <p>1 was from YOUR link...  If you want info on the OSHA stuff, look up OSHA N95 testing, it's all public documentation.  All the tests are for whether the mask is allowing particulates IN.</p>
<p>2) source?  seriously.  and try for one that doesn't use PCR as the only test of "infected"</p>
<p>3) Lockdowns exist because we got all envious at what china was doing to their population.  There's no science here, it was a kids school project (seriously).  If lockdowns worked, there would be evidence when comparing lockdown stringency to outcome.  Anecdotally, the "California vs Florida" test, but toss in all the states and countries.  Nada.</p>

        <p>3) it links to another article, their actual discussion of the paper about lockdowns saving lives:</p>
<p>"The Imperial study analysed the impact of lockdowns and social distancing steps in 11 European countries and found they had “a substantial effect”, helping to lower the infection’s reproductive rate, or R value, below one by early May."</p>
<p>"By comparing the number of deaths counted with deaths predicted by their model if no lockdown measures had been introduced, they found some 3.1 million deaths were averted."</p>
<p>So they used one of their models, all of which have been wrong, to claim an incredible number of deaths, then because they didn't see those deaths, lockdowns worked!  They also projected an incredible number of deaths for sweden, that didn't lock down, and those also failed to materialize.</p>
<p>Further "A second study by scientists in the United States, published alongside the Imperial-led one in the journal Nature, estimated that lockdowns in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the United States had prevented or delayed around 530 million COVID-19 cases."   </p>
<p>They claim (based on PCR, btw) a reduction OR DELAY in cases and thus R0, and go with your assumption that that means lives were saved.</p>
<p>These all fall apart when you actually dig in to them.  Listening to CNN or reuters or any newsmedia for science will never get you the truth.</p>
<p>2) "There are tests that diagnose current infection"....PCR</p>
<p>This is a lie.  Period.  PCR cannot do this.  Yes, I'm saying a harvard site is lying.  Or completely incompetent.  PCR is incapable.  Listen to Kary Mullis, chemistry Nobel laureate and inventor of PCR on it.  Listen to Fauci, that at &rt;35 cycles, you're only finding dead RNA.  You're also swabbing the exterior of a person, so even if you run a culture and find live virus, you're not able to prove from the swab that it ever made it past the passive immune systems (mucous membranes in this case) and made a person sick.  PCR IS NOT MEDICALLY DIAGNOSTIC.  You can be completely immune and still test positive to covid, chickenpox, whatever.  Go find a bio textbook and look at what PCR actually does.  It detects RNA fragments.  NOTHING MORE. The protocol can help determine a bit more, but this one is so poorly written as to be extremely permissive.  Only 2 assays from a smaller portion of the strand, too many cycles, etc.  (the critical assessment is quite thorough).</p>
<p>Please, go educate yourself on what PCR does, and how, and how it SHOULD be used, and how THIS protocol is specifically poor.  Every bit of hype stems from this one protocol that was never peer reviewed (probably because the author is on the board of the magazine that published it!) and adopted by the WHO a day later.</p>

        <p>That wasn't a joke.</p>
<p>It would take a whole lot, but it could happen.</p>
<p>A mask has tiny holes that are large enough to let oxygen pass through, but not the virus. Therefore, If you cover each and every hole on a mask in your throat with another mask, as long as it touches the sides, it can kill you.</p>

        <p><strong>Quarantine:</strong> Put the vulnerable in isolation (optional)</p>
<p><strong>Lockdown:</strong> Prison term for when you keep all prisoners inside their cells, typically as a punishment after a riot, or to prevent trouble. Prisons have strict rules for how long a lock down can be, typically a few days max and the prison is required to make sure that all prisoners are healthy and get all their needs covered during lockdown.</p>
<p>You seem to be pro lock down for the whole world, and for a whole year. How so? It didn't make any difference, we still live in a fascist clown world.</p>
