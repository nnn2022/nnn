        <p>Yeah those are pretty common talking points at this point. I‚Äôve brought them up, not because I knew it was a talking point but because it‚Äôs just rational to come to that conclusion if you study the history of science, medicine, and the intersection that lies between them and government affairs</p>
<p>Smoking was deemed safe, even legal to do around others including children not even one generation ago. </p>
<p>We know better today, and nobody does better. Hell, even most of these mask people I‚Äôll see smoking with that shit on their chin. They don‚Äôt care about their health or mine so they can fuck off</p>

        <p>Their "TrUsT tHe ScIeNcE" arguments don't make sense because of they way things change with more research.  </p>

<p>Even vaping, was apparently supposed to be super safe opposed to cigarettes.  Now it's apparently worse than cigarettes.</p>

        <p>Any logical person would have come to the conclusion vaping was not good for you. People who vape avidly beliefs the name, they believe it‚Äôs like water vapour or something harmless üòÇ oh yeah just some fruity flavoured water ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è like no. For you to boil water, you need a lot of energy, you can‚Äôt cheat thermodynamics. This could not fit inside a pen. But anyways it‚Äôs not merely water inside a vaping pen, it‚Äôs some chemical concoction that turns into vapour better than water. Idk exactly what‚Äôs in it because I haven‚Äôt ever looked into it because at the end of be day stupid people will do what they do. But it has to have a severely lower boiling point than water to be able to turn into vapour with the minuscule amount of heat that those tiny pens can generate. Also, breathing in water vapour is literally what causes pneumonia so even if it was just water breathing that in 20 times a day is also dumb. </p>
<p>When you actually know the fundamentals of science, nobody can dupe you.</p>
