    <strong>There is absolutely no reason for restrictions to continue once the vaccine is made available to everyone, and there is absolutely no reason for the vaccine to be mandated</strong>
    <p><p>In order for me, a young, healthy, non-vaccinated person, to cause the hospitalization or death of a vaccinated person, the following sequence of events must occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I need to contract the virus. Presumably, this is going to become increasingly less likely as more people get vaccinated. (Some may disagree, but I do believe the vaccine is effective at preventing severe illness, so fewer people with severe illness means lower spread.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to transmit the virus asymptomatically. (If I had symptoms, I would stay home since I’m a responsible person.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other person, a vaccinated individual, must be in that small group of people that have received the vaccine but do not reap the benefits of protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other person must be capable of developing illness severe enough to require hospitalization, presumably by having pre-existing conditions (or just bad luck?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other person must actually develop the severe illness. (I don’t believe that everyone with a pre-existing condition who is exposed to the virus develops severe illness.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on these requirements, and the fact that the hospitalization rate was fairly low even before vaccines were available, I do believe that I would have to be in close contact with thousands upon thousands of vaccinated people while asymptomatically sick in order to cause the hospitalization of even one vaccinated person. </p>
<p>In other words, I don’t believe that me receiving a vaccine is going to save even one person’s life, whose life couldn’t be saved by them choosing to receive the vaccine themselves. Meanwhile, the long-term risks associated with the injection have yet to be seen, a fact that is especially worrisome for young people.</p>
<p>This is not to say that people will not continue dying. There are the variants that may or may not escape the vaccine, and of course the vulnerable people who choose not to get the injection will remain vulnerable. But the key point is, none of that has anything to do with me not receiving the injection.</p>
<p>It should be my right to do my own risk-benefit analysis and decide whether it’s appropriate for me to receive the injection, and it bothers me immensely to see mandates being described in the news.</p>
<p>Note that this is an opinion article. If you disagree with something I wrote, I’d love to hear about it, but it’d be nice if you could do so nicely.</p></p>

        <p>I completely agree. And if they tell me I have to get it at my job, I intend to tell them I'm willing to take an antibody test, but that's all. However, there's a good chance I don't have antibodies. I haven't been sick at any point in the past year.</p>

<p>I imagine lots of competent people will have a reasonable amount of negotiation power in such a situation because it can be a pain for the employer to replace and retrain someone.</p>

        <p>If only I could be so brave...I would hesitate to threaten quitting because they might not value me as much as I think they ought to. They might just say "fine, go find another job."</p>
<p>But I hope you're right. I'm sure there are other people at my job who do not want the injection, but the question is are they willing to stand up to it? Or will people be like, "I don't want this, but I need my job so I guess I'll get it"?</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, unless you're close friends with these people, I don't think there is much you can do to convince them all. I think what's important is to stay true to yourself, because once they see someone <em>choosing the option</em> to resist, they are made aware that such an option even exists and that it might not be so bad to not go along with the crowd. Might get some allies like that.</p>

        <p>I agree, but I'm not sure I follow how less severe symptoms means less spread. The "vaccine" allegedly removes a protein that facilitates infection, which reduces the severity of the virus, but does not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Regardless, there is zero reason to segregate the non-vaccinated. If the vaccinated don't feel protected or if they don't seroconvert, they can choose to stay home. The vaccinated spread the virus just as easily.</p>

        <p>My understanding from what I've read about it is that if symptoms are less severe, as in less coughing, etc., then the person is less likely to spread it. But on the other hand, if the vaccine in fact does not prevent the asymptomatic transmission (assuming that is real), then having a less severe case could cause you to not know you have it and then spread it to other people. A few weeks ago I read that they're not sure if it prevents asymptomatic transmission, and now suddenly they're saying it does. Just another suspicious aspect of it all.</p>

        <p>The one thing you miss is that some high risk individuals may not be able to be vaccinated for medical reasons. This is why herd immunity is so important. That said, between people who willingly get vaccinated and those who have naturally gained immunity through infection, I don’t imagine it will be a huge issue. I think for the most part those who have a loved one in that category will get vaccinated themselves which will solve the bulk of that problem. If you are healthy, willing to stay home when sick, and aren’t generally around high risk people, then I really don’t see a need for the vaccine at this time.</p>

        <p>I feel like herd immunity is only applicable until another variant comes along that escapes the vaccine. From what I've read, this is already a distinct possibility. And another variant could develop in animals and be transmitted back to humans. But I'm glad that we're in agreement on the key point: vaccination is not necessary for everybody.</p>

        <p>Yes thats totally possible. There have been many flu pandemics and there will be more. Still, I think a lot of people on here completely ignore the fact that it's not medically possible for everyone to get vaccinated. On the other side of things though, just because some people have compromised immune systems it doesn't mean we should all isolate.</p>

        <p>Oh no, you forgot about herd immunity, remember? They need every single person to be vaccinated or we won't have herd immunity. Except...as far as I know, establishing herd immunity is meant to protect the people who aren't able to get the vaccine. But...all the "experts" are telling pregnant women to get the vaccine and were even testing it on pregnant women...so if a pregnant woman and a developing fetus can get the vaccine, who exactly can't?</p>
