        <p>I mean at the end of the day their is no real competition</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" . The two par- ties are two factions of the business party. Most of the population doesn't even bother voting because it looks meaningless. "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"You want to create a slogna that nobody's going to be against, and everybody's going to be for. Nobody knows what it means, because it doesn't mean anything. Its crucial value is that it diverts your attention from a question that does mean something: Do you support our policy? That's the one you're not allowed to talk about. So you have people arguing about support for the troops? "Of course I don't not support them." Then you've won. That's like Americanism and harmony. We're all together, empty slogans, let's join in, let's make sure we don't have these bad people around to disrupt our harmony with their talk about class struggle, rights and that sort of business. That's all very effective. It runs right up to today. And of course it is carefully thought out. The people in the public relations industry aren't there for the fun of it. They're doing work. They're trying to instill the right values. In fact, they have a conception of what democ- racy ought to be: It ought to be a system in which the specialized class is trained to work in the service of the masters, the people who own the society.</p>
<p>The rest of the population ought to be deprived of any form of organiza- tion, because organization just causes trouble. They ought to be sitting alone in front of the TV and having drilled into their heads the mes- sage, which says, the only value in life is to have more commodities or live like that rich middle class family you're watching and to have nice values like harmony and American- ism. That's all there is in life. You may think in your own head that there's got to be some- thing more in life than this, but since you're watching the tube alone you assume, I must be crazy, because that's all that's going on over there. And since there is no organization per- mitted—that's absolutely crucial—you never have a way of finding out whether you are crazy, and you just assume it, because it's the natural thing to assume. So that's the ideal. Great efforts are made in trying to achieve that ideal. Obviously, there is a certain conception behind it.</p>
<p>The conception of democracy is the one that I men- tioned. The bewildered herd is a problem. We've got to prevent their roar and trampling. We've got to distract them. They should be watching the Superbowl or sitcoms or violent movies. Every once in a while you call on them to chant meaningless slogans like "Sup- port our troops." You've got to keep them pretty scared, because unless they're properly scared and frightened of all kinds of devils that are going to destroy them from outside or inside or somewhere, they may start to think, which is very dangerous, because they're not competent to think. Therefore it's important to distract them and marginalize them.</p>
<p>That's one conception of democracy. In fact, going back to the business community, the last legal victory for labor really was 1935, the Wagner Act. After the war came, the unions declined as did a very rich working class cul- ture that was associated with the unions. That was destroyed. We moved to a business-run society at a remarkable level. This is the only state-capitalist industrial society which does- n't have even the normal social contract that you find in comparable societies.</p>
<p>Outside of South Africa, I guess, this is the only industrial society that doesn't have national health care. There's no general commitment to even min- imal standards of survival for the parts of the population who can't follow those rules and gain things for themselves individually. Unions are virtually nonexistent. Other forms of popular structure are virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p>There are no political parties or organizations. It's a long way toward the ideal, at least struc- turally. The media are a corporate monopoly. They have the same point of view. The two par- ties are two factions of the business party. Most of the population doesn't even bother voting because it looks meaningless.</p>
<p>They're mar- ginalized and properly distracted. At least that's the goal. The leading figure in the public rela- tions industry, Edward Bernays, actually came out of the Creel Commission.</p>
<p>e was part of it, learned his lessons there and went on to develop what he called the "engineering of con- sent," which he described as "the essence of democracy." The people who are able to engi- neer consent are the ones who have the resources and the power to do it—the business community—and that's who you work for."""</p>

<p>But people that wear a mask, while alone in their car</p>
<p>They baffle me. I dont even think they are all necessarily Democrats; I think they are just low information. Perhaps I'm giving them too much credit. </p>
<p>Remember: masks arent perfect, so dont bother wearing them unless you are indoors, around other people, and expect to not be able to social distance (i.e. grocery stores). Also, if you are feeling sick, wear a damn mask! Even if it's not covid, it could help prevent someone else from catching and spreading it and being miserable. (Or dying if immunocompromised)</p>

<p>simply put no their are not the parties that have a  chance of winning are always controlled by the elite</p>

<p>I mean at the end of the day their is no real competition</p>
<p>" . The two par- ties are two factions of the business party. Most of the population doesn't even bother voting because it looks meaningless. "</p>
<p>"You want to create a slogna that nobody's going to be against, and everybody's going to be for. Nobody knows what it means, because it doesn't mean anything. Its crucial value is that it diverts your attention from a question that does mean something: Do you support our policy? That's the one you're not allowed to talk about. So you have people arguing about support for the troops? "Of course I don't not support them." Then you've won. That's like Americanism and harmony. We're all together, empty slogans, let's join in, let's make sure we don't have these bad people around to disrupt our harmony with their talk about class struggle, rights and that sort of business. That's all very effective. It runs right up to today. And of course it is carefully thought out. The people in the public relations industry aren't there for the fun of it. They're doing work. They're trying to instill the right values. In fact, they have a conception of what democ- racy ought to be: It ought to be a system in which the specialized class is trained to work in the service of the masters, the people who own the society.</p>
<p>The rest of the population ought to be deprived of any form of organiza- tion, because organization just causes trouble. They ought to be sitting alone in front of the TV and having drilled into their heads the mes- sage, which says, the only value in life is to have more commodities or live like that rich middle class family you're watching and to have nice values like harmony and American- ism. That's all there is in life. You may think in your own head that there's got to be some- thing more in life than this, but since you're watching the tube alone you assume, I must be crazy, because that's all that's going on over there. And since there is no organization per- mitted—that's absolutely crucial—you never have a way of finding out whether you are crazy, and you just assume it, because it's the natural thing to assume. So that's the ideal. Great efforts are made in trying to achieve that ideal. Obviously, there is a certain conception behind it.</p>
<p>The conception of democracy is the one that I men- tioned. The bewildered herd is a problem. We've got to prevent their roar and trampling. We've got to distract them. They should be watching the Superbowl or sitcoms or violent movies. Every once in a while you call on them to chant meaningless slogans like "Sup- port our troops." You've got to keep them pretty scared, because unless they're properly scared and frightened of all kinds of devils that are going to destroy them from outside or inside or somewhere, they may start to think, which is very dangerous, because they're not competent to think. Therefore it's important to distract them and marginalize them.</p>
<p>That's one conception of democracy. In fact, going back to the business community, the last legal victory for labor really was 1935, the Wagner Act. After the war came, the unions declined as did a very rich working class cul- ture that was associated with the unions. That was destroyed. We moved to a business-run society at a remarkable level. This is the only state-capitalist industrial society which does- n't have even the normal social contract that you find in comparable societies.</p>
<p>Outside of South Africa, I guess, this is the only industrial society that doesn't have national health care. There's no general commitment to even min- imal standards of survival for the parts of the population who can't follow those rules and gain things for themselves individually. Unions are virtually nonexistent. Other forms of popular structure are virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p>There are no political parties or organizations. It's a long way toward the ideal, at least struc- turally. The media are a corporate monopoly. They have the same point of view. The two par- ties are two factions of the business party. Most of the population doesn't even bother voting because it looks meaningless.</p>
<p>They're mar- ginalized and properly distracted. At least that's the goal. The leading figure in the public rela- tions industry, Edward Bernays, actually came out of the Creel Commission.</p>
<p>e was part of it, learned his lessons there and went on to develop what he called the "engineering of con- sent," which he described as "the essence of democracy." The people who are able to engi- neer consent are the ones who have the resources and the power to do it—the business community—and that's who you work for."""</p>
