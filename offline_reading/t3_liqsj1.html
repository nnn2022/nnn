    <strong>I hate young people in university who support lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>It's so easy for them to say. They're all living with their housemates while I'm at home with my family. Young people have this instinctual desire to go out and explore, which, I had satisfied when I was going to class and meeting my friends, even though I didn't move out. But these guys have that met! No wonder they're OK with lockdown. They're away from their homes and living with their friends! </p>
<p>And none of them are virgins! Yeah, fine. I'm a religious guy, I don't practice premarital relations. But honestly, I'm almost in my mid 20s and still haven't been on a date yet. These guys and girls have had at least 2 long term relationships by age 20. Probably quadruple the amount of sexual partners.</p>
<p>It's 100% easy for these guys to survive the next 10 years without a relationship, they've already tasted the fruit that I desperately yearn for. As far as my opinion goes, I reckon population control is a possible agenda here. Preventing couples from meeting each other, preventing singles from dating, it genuinely seems they're trying to reduce pregnancies.</p>
<p>I'm sat here, lonely, desperate and extremely agitated.</p>
<p>I genuinely regret not getting into a relationship earlier on.</p>
<p>I don't think this damn lockdown is ever going to end. Remember to teach your kids what life was like when we had freedom. Don't let them live without knowing.</p></p>

        <p>Alright, I totally get where you’re coming from. But I think you’re coming at the problem the wrong way and building resentment. Use this time to build on yourself, continue to fight the lockdowns and what is happening. But use the time you have to strive to be better. There’s always ways to connect with people, and with women who share your faith. Don’t let the people who push the lockdowns win, by letting them make you resentful and live rent free in your head they win. You’ll come out the other end of this just fine and more confident in yourself and your convictions as long as you refuse to fall into the trap of desperation and resentment. Best of luck to you.</p>

        <p>That’s a totally legitimate fear, I get it. But we are all pushing back. Everyone is getting tired of this and waking up. If you convince two people of the facts of the matter and what is going on, to not have fear but be confident in our right to freedom, and they each show two people there’s nothing we can’t accomplish. There’s way more of us than there are of those in power and they’re terrified that we all stand against them. You’re gonna do just fine, fight the good fight.</p>

        <p>I'm in that bracket. I've never been a cuck for the government, but I agree with you as I don't know a single person around my age who isn't gargling government balls.</p>
<p>It was the Universities that did this. I didn't go when everyone I knew did. I watched over 4 years how they were indoctrinated, first with feminism, then socialism. </p>
<p>Want to get laid in college? You better be a feminist. Want friends? You better vote blue.</p>
<p>They held everything that makes college fun for ransom, and if you ever dissented you threatened the social success of those around you, so they would police you on the governments behalf. </p>
<p>They turned my friends into NPCs, and it's only gotten worse after graduating.</p>

        <p>I'm a bit older than you and in the UK, but that all resonates strongly. I can't put it into words, but when I look at the world and the received opinions on display now, something isn't right. It's surreal and disturbing...is it just the logical consequence of decades of sly-winking postmodernism creeping through the institutions? What's behind it all?</p>
<p>I don't like conspiracy, it's not the Illuminati or some old bollocks, but we've certainly lost our way.</p>
<p>May I recommend Theodore Dalrymple 'Our culture: what's left of it'. Written some years back in the UK but I'm sure there must be an American equivalent.</p>

        <p>Shit it's rough :/ I don't think these lockdowns are working tbh. I think I'm not bothering with university after this year. Another few grand for a bit of paper is basically what it is. No social life, no actual decent teaching really. You are just paying to say you have a degree and put it on your CV. I'm not sure it is worth it anymore. I know a lot of people end up going for the social aspect. So, you take that away and its fucking shite for some courses</p>

        <p>I don’t really see how they would want population control. Citizens are the main source of income for the government via taxes and other such things. If you killed off most of your population what would you have to control? I don’t think the purpose of this lockdown is population control, there is definitely something bigger going on though.</p>

        <p>Now that's a tough call. VAERS numbers suggest that pregnant women are indeed getting the vaccine and are indeed having miscarriages. Yes, its known the WHO changed stances and "updated" suggesting no known complications come from vaccines but do so at your own risk. Hmm.</p>

        <p>I'll offer some advice from an older guy - religion makes a very big deal out of sex (to promote a gynocentric social order) but really you'll have it and yeah its kind of fun and exciting but afterwards probably the first thing that will go through your mind is how its really not a big deal.</p>
<p>I thought like you when I was a young man that it was something for relationships only even though I'm actually an atheist (just not a cringe neckbeard internet one) but my experiences with women made me realise that my beliefs were not based on reality. That it is impossible to have something serious or meaningful in the current sexual marketplace and that was a long time ago back in the mid 00's when the world was very different. None of the girls I went to school with would have set up an only fans. When I was a young man women had to settle for what was available among a fairly small pool of guys, where as now they can select from the genetically superior alpha males within a 20 mile radius from their smartphone.</p>
<p>It's a dating wasteland out there. I was so disgusted with it I haven't bothered to go on a date since 2016. I'm not saying you couldn't find something in university - because school and university are really the best environments for meeting women but don't get your hopes up. Don't pedestalise sex or women. You will in all probability be bitterly disappointed.</p>
<p>I really hope you don't get offended and feel like I am flaming you. I don't mean to. All men are an island to an extent. We have to make our choices and live with them. But I wandered around the wilderness for years and got burned before I found out the truth and I wish I could go back to 2006 and slap the shit out of me when I was that age for all the blue pilled shit I believed.</p>

        <p>Bro you posted cringe</p>
<p>Of all things that lockdown destroys, you're complaining about virginity and sex? That kind of base animal manipulation is exactly why we're in this mess!</p>
<p>Besides, sex is cringe. What you earn for is romantic involvement most likely - something a lot of people simply miss with or without lockdowns. That's the harsh truth; I myself were a socially inept shut-in before all this, I cannot in good consciousness blame the lockdowns on my lack of "luck" with partners (excluding the fact I'm not really looking for relationships or sex either). If you didn't pop your cherry before 20 that's on you only.</p>

        <p>I was a freshman in September. Moved away from home, knew literally no one and the University did jackshit helping freshmen connect with others. And then all these upperclassmen and talking about how we shouldn't be complaining. So I just sat in my room for 3 months and drank every day cause there was nothing to do, nowhere to go and no one to talk to.</p>

        <p>&rt;I reckon population control is a possible agenda here. Preventing couples from meeting each other, preventing singles from dating, it genuinely seems they're trying to reduce pregnancies.</p>
<p>Wow...... </p>
<p>~~Don't worry, it's not COVID that's preventing you getting into a relationship, probably your personality.~~</p>
<p>You know what, re reading this and glancing at your comment history makes me feel bad. Listen, the past year has fucking sucked, its been rough, a horrific number of lives have been lost and we're all going through our own shit. I've a good job, amazing wife, and thankfully haven't had to worry about bills but the past 12 months have been hard. </p>
<p>Look after yourself, things suck but we'll get through this together. This stupid virus is real, people are suffering, lives will unfortunately be lost, but we'll get through this. Pointless to add but if you ever need a pickup message me.</p>

        <p>&rt;It's 100% easy for these guys to survive the next 10 years without a relationship,</p>
<p>You're probably wrong here. I was talking with my roommate the other day and he doesn't think he could go a year without sex. Another good friend of mine doesn't know how to live alone. He's been in a relationship since early highschool years, and I don't think he's been single for more than a few months at a time. Right now the girl he's dating gets into fights with him on a weekly basis. Every one of his friends and his parents have said they don't like her. Yet he's in the relationship because I don't think he can handle being alone. </p>
<p>You know how to be alone. You know how to wake up in an empty bed, and get the courage to leave it. Frat boys don't know how to be alone. One is my friends is a strong Christian (but not abstinent) who's in a relationship he knows won't last with a girl who shares essentially none of his views. But he'd rather be in a doomed relationship, than actually find the right girl. </p>
<p>It's better to wait. That way you'll know you'll get the right one, and if she's not right, you can move on. Those that don't wait, suffer from the need for companionship.</p>

        <p>That sucks.  Who knows, maybe you can still find someone in lockdown.  Not everyone is scared. You might be surprised. Also spring is on the way - better weather will open up more opportunities. </p>
<p>Because you sound depressed I'm going to link something that helped me.  There's this hermit priest who teaches about mental prayer/how to meditate like the saints. It's helped me a lot.</p>

        <p>All of us here hate lockdowns but you shouldn’t blame them for your lack of a relationship or social life.  The idea that this is a form of population control veers way too much into actual conspiracy theory as well. </p>
<p>Instead of moping or blaming the lockdown for your troubles, use this time to work on yourself and figure out how to be happy independently. If you can achieve that you’ll have no problem meeting someone when the time is right.</p>
