    <p><p>Title says it all. </p>
<p>I mean what's the point in claiming to be anti covid doomers, only to perpetuate your own version of doom. </p>
<p>If you really think bill gates etc have won in totality, what are you waiting for? Go get the shot because you have lost anyway, right? Wrong. </p>
<p>Have faith in god, stay aware, get enlightened, hope for the best, prepare to tackle the worst and aim to win no matter what. In the mean time enjoy good things in life. </p>
<p>What's the point of living if you have conceded defeat at a spiritual and emotional level?</p></p>

        <p>You have to keep in mind that a lot of places are still really bad for restrictions and that a number of people have lost most of their friends or even family to the covid cult.  It’s understandable that they feel like it will never end. </p>

        <p>On one hand, I agree, OP.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I see, in addition to totalitarian powermongering across the "free" world becoming endemic, even more sinisterly, large swathes of the population being systematically othered, dehumanized ("plague rats"), scapegoated, and even segregated for refusing the experimental mRNA gene therapy. Not just by bots and shills on hellholes like here or Twitter either. You even see mainstream "news" media doing it.</p>
<p>With all this info, it's hard for me not to become at least a little alarmed at the road this is going down. Anyone with any knowledge whatsoever of human history should say the same.</p>

        <p>Well honestly, after my first 25 years of all kinds of abuse starting with almost 8 years of sexual abuse at the ripe age of 2 1/2 yrs, then verbal abuse. then physical abuse, then back to much mental abuse, I’m grateful I’m old now, and with no children.  I don’t see myself living past the next three years tbh.   It’s a shame people who have suffered extremes are more awake than the rest of society.  Whatever, is what it is at this point.  For some reason, we see more truths than the regular herd who have not been so damaged.  Sucks I spilled my shit out now, but whatever.  When one can truly see how evil our system is, well if people can’t wake up to the fucking truth at this point,I have no fucking pity on you fools.</p>

        <p>I'll be fine. My kids will be fine. Not so sure how everyone else will be. Most people took the jab and it also doesn't work against new covid variants. So it's not like this all ends and everything goes back to normal even when most people have taken their double jab. We're probably entering a dark period in human history, but I plan on surviving it.</p>

<p>Internet is not real life. Its a distillated version of the stupidest and worst humanity has to offer. The world has always been a burning dumpster fire. If you walk around crying that the world is ending and tyranny and blah blah blah, your gonna miss out on the rest of life. </p>
<p>Theres a fine line between being informed and aware versus letting negative news run your entire life and hijack your consciousness.</p>

<p>You must not live in an area where Cult of the Mask and Vax reign supreme.</p>
<p>Because when you leave your house you will be reminded about Masks and the rest.</p>
<p>You'll walk halfway to the bank and realize you forgot your Mask and have to go back home first, because they wont' let you in otherwise... etc.</p>
<p>It's also easy to be all happy-dappy and positive when your bills are getting paid.. like you said, either by a job, or by collecting government benefit cheques.</p>
<p>For people who are losing their jobs, livelihoods, businesses and futures, it's a little harder to be happy about that.</p>

        <p>And buy guns before you buy bread. They can say a million times that your guns are ineffective but there's a reason they haven't dared to enforce a door to door gun grab. Because their guy can flash his cute badge all he wants, but if he is threatening the life and violating the constitutional rights of an innocent citizen by trespassing onto private property, then he is no longer acting in the spirit of law enforcement. He is merely a thug, a terrorist who, by his own choice, wants to fuck around and find out. </p>
<p>And guess what, the thug with a badge fears death as much as any human without a badge does. And that's why an armed populace is a peaceful populace. Be lovable but ungovernable.</p>

        <p>Im in CA, so belly of the beast. I lost my job and I got another. Not as good paying and not as comfy. I cant afford to feel sorry for anonymous people who have lost things unless Im going to help them directly. Nobody will feel sorry for me if bad things happen to me and my future is destroyed. </p>
<p>I'll get angry when its time to fight, and believe me,  its all there. But in everyday life Im just gonna do what I do. If you get upset at all the injustice in the world your gonna off yourself because theres a never ending stream of content to go through. </p>
<p>And Im not minimizing what a travesty this all is. Just saying theres a time and a place for everything and allowing negate news to color every aspect of your life is not good. Seriously. Its not a crime to be happy and crack jokes when the world is going to shit.</p>

        <p>The “doomers” on this side are simply realists. Believe me, we’d all like to believe that the elites won’t win this time, and that good will always triumph in every situation, but that’s just not true. The evidence is overwhelmingly indicating that the elites <em>are</em> succeeding, despite how ludicrous their plans sound, though perhaps sounding crazy is how they get away with it all—hardly anybody believes that they could actually do it.</p>
<p>The reason for all of this trickery on the part of the elites is <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">the Great Reset</a>. Broadly speaking, the Great Reset is a plan involving remaking the world’s economic and political systems on the basis that what we have now doesn’t work. There are many components of the Great Reset, lbut the core theme of it is sustainability in the form of “carbon neutrality,” as they put it.</p>
<p>That sounds good on the surface, even if they are taking advantage of the pandemic as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset">“a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world.”</a> As the saying goes, though, the devil is in the details—besides <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles">phasing out fossil fuels</a>, they will be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9501565/How-Bidens-climate-plan-affect-everyday-Americans.html">cutting red meat consumption to just 4lbs per year (a 90% reduction)</a>, forcing people to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/04/04/home-radiators-will-have-ten-degrees-cooler-britain-reach-net/">turn their heaters 10 degrees Celsius cooler</a>, <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/299414/REP_Absolute_Zero_V3_20200505.pdf?sequence=9&amp;isAllowed=y">stopping shipping and air travel completely</a>, and many other things besides. Most ominous is the WEF’s vision for 2030, which involves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBBxWtKKQiA">people “owning nothing” yet being “happy.”</a></p>
<p>The first of two major methods they are using to begin is process is COVID vaccination, which they are using to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/05/15/vaccine-passports-covid-19-vaccine-verification-coming/7130642002/">introduce vaccine passports</a>, the first of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine.html">having already been rolled out in New York (the Excelsior pass)</a>, to which it is conspicuously easy to attach a digital wallet. And this will likely be the next step, given the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/">WEF’s open support of a cashless society.</a> It does not really need spelling out (but I will do so anyway) that the reason for this is to remove physical money from the equation in order to establish control; it is all well and good if you have money, but if you can’t use it because it’s all in the cloud and you’ve engaged in too many “dissident” activities,  then it doesn’t matter if you’re a broke college student or a multimillionaire—you’re still not going to be able to feed yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">The prevailing theory regarding taking away everyone’s property and possessions (or their ownership of them, at first) is that there will be a debt forgiveness program</a> (note: while I don’t know how true it is that that link is an actual leak, I am providing it because it makes logical sense, and shows I am not just making up my own theories on this). Once the economy has crashes, the government will say something like “we know the economy is terrible and you don’t have a job, the money to pay your debts, or the means to put food on the table; but if you join our debt forgiveness program, it’ll all go away, and you’ll receive a UBI payment, too.” But in order to join the program, you’ll have to be vaccinated and give up ownership of all your possessions. This would include money (after all, money is used to buy possessions).</p>
<p>The second way is through the budding cyber pandemic, which <a href="https://youtu.be/0DKRvS-C04o">Klaus Schwab himself said will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience, and will involve a grid-down scenario.</a> Indeed, there have already been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/">attacks on SolarWinds and FireEye</a>. Most troublingly, FireEye’s offensive toolkit, one of the best in the world and normally used to test defensive software for large corporations and the government, was stolen in the hack. This was preceded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210531124228/https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/from-event-201-to-cyber-polygon-the-wefs-simulation-of-a-coming-cyber-pandemic/">Cyber Polygon 2020, which conspicuously was planning for that exact type of hack, reminiscent of how Event 201 preceded the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by just a few weeks</a>, and will shortly be followed by <a href="https://cyberpolygon.com">Cyber Polygon 2021 on July 9th</a>.</p>
<p>They will use this second line of offense to justify the creation of a new system, since the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, along with the shipping container and crop shortages (and other artificial agricultural vulnerabilities), will trigger a depression worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s and prove to the people that the current system doesn’t work.</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t even half of what is going on here, so I highly encourage you to look into it yourself.</p>
<p>So yes, have faith in God, but don’t stick your head in the sand. We are God’s hands and feet. Act in God, and God will act in you. We haven’t lost yet, and in the end, we know we won’t. But we don’t yet know the outcome of this particular battle, so we’d best batten down the hatches to weather the storm.</p>

        <p>I don't know, isn't reality that hell on earth is coming. I believe we could even be in what the Bible called the  Tribulation RIGHT NOW. The "think positive" garbage got us here in the first place. I say enjoy what you can of life before they take everything away and stand up for yourself but ignoring what is happening, isn't a path either.</p>
