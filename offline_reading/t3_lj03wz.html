    <strong>Why do you feel such an urgent need to deny the pandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>It honestly feels like you’re all just overreacting to the situation, somewhere inside you were scared when it first dropped, so you built up a defense mechanism. If not, why care so hard to disprove what’s obviously happening? And no, those of us who believe it’s happening and is serious are not reacting like you’re trying to portray us, sitting in front of TVs scared shitless. Nah, I just live my daily life like I used to, with the slight adjustment for restrictions that I try to follow. That’s what I’ve been doing from the very beginning of all this and I haven’t felt the need to deny the pandemic exists.</p>
<p>Edit - Right now I’m going out to walk my dog, would it be possible if the restrictions were are as bad as you all say? You’re overreacting.</p></p>

        <p>Why do you feel such a need to presume our opinions?  Few if any of us deny the pandemic; we just assert that the danger's overstated, and far less than that of the reactions to it.</p>

        <p>I just discovered this sub and was under the impression that it’s a denier sub. Nonetheless, this approach seems to be the right one though. Even countries like Sweden backed off their “no-restrictions” approach and started introducing them. Just live your life like you used to, but with a piece of cloth here and there when needed, what’s so bad?</p>

        <p>Masks are not working here in Quebec. We didn't have a mask mandate in the first wave, and we introduced it before the second wave. Second wave was worse, than the first. It doesn't look like an evidence that masks do any good. </p>
<p>Why are we keeping measures that do not work? </p>
<p>On the other hand, in Wuhan people are having pool parties. That worked - they have 0 COVID. I think we should have less masks and more pool parties.</p>

        <p>Masks aren’t supposed to evaporate the virus, just limit its spread at least a bit. I’d say even one less person being infected thanks to masks is enough of a good reason to keep them. </p>
<p>Yeah but Wuhan introduced extreme lockdown measures in the first months, idk if you’d like that if you can’t stand masks.</p>

        <p>You can travel in and out of Wuhan, actually there are more people going in and out there than Toronto. People illegally cross all borders in the world, including chinese border with North Korea, but nobody illegally jumped quarantine and brought COVID in Wuhan in over a year. </p>
<p>You can do anything you want in Wuhan, so once the virus is in, it can go rampage.  Since Feb 2020 they did not have a second outbreak, their pandemic finished when it just started in the West. Chinese quarantine measures seem to perfectly seal the country </p>
<p>Those measures they took in February gave them life long immunity you think? There are waaaaay more flights going into Wuhan than into Toronto at this moment. There is even one flight going to Wuhan from Toronto, and they are not afraid that COVID will come from Toronto. </p>
<p>No amount of 'extreme lockdowning' can yield such results, or are you of a different opinion?</p>

        <p>The thing is, most of us aren't sentient viruses that've figured out how to type, and that's the only group for whom your approach is the correct one.  What's so bad is wearing that damned piece of cloth.  Covid is very contagious.  It's also essentially harmless- it doesn't feel that way when it's killing you, but all but a handful of those who die are old and/or sickly.  This disease has an IFR comparable with chicken pox.  </p>
<p>Those of us here want the pandemic to END.  A virus that causes a virus so contagious that it's crossed species borders at least seven times and hardly kills anyone CANNOT be waited out; it must be endured.  Isolate the vulnerable, and send out the healthy and strong to contract it, recover, and develop herd immunity, so that the vulnerable survive.  Let people choose their level of risk.</p>
<p>The initial fear of hospitals being overwhelmed ("two weeks to flatten the curve", remember?) was based on models that said Covid was much more dangerous than it actually is.  We don't WANT the spread to stop; we want it to move quickly through the population so it can burn itself out.</p>
<p>See, you may be able to "live like you used to", but a lot of us can't.  A lot of us are chafing under some pretty serious restrictions.  Many of us know people who've died from them.  And they won't end until the pandemic does.  And that won't happen until herd immunity is developed.  And that won't happen until you fools take your damned masks off.</p>

        <p>So according to your logic, you are asking others to wear a mask but aren't sure if they work or not but that it's easy to do. Got it! Also, FL is the state Florida... They never implemented a lockdown or mask mandate and have reached herd immunity... Can you explain how they were able to do that without your precious mandates that you're salivating over?</p>

        <p>Masks don't work, the true scientific evidence proves that, what difference would be made if someone virtue signaled that they are wearing a mask? If it works for you, I'm genuinely happy about that but again others don't need to be forced into wearing one if they don't need. The proof of Florida is in the numbers, on a scale they have done so much better in comparison to places with strict lockdowns and mask mandates, which proves that neither of these work</p>

        <p>So you don’t think wearing a mask, (which is proven to be ineffective) shutting down the economy and destroying people’s mental and physical health en masse to stop a virus which has a .003% mortality rate isn’t overreacting? Not to mention that most actual Covid deaths are people who are past life expectancy age, this little “pandemic” is gonna cause future generations to be paying for our mistakes for years to come... and you think we’re overreacting?</p>
<p>In my eyes your lack of self awareness is extremely disturbing.</p>

        <p>Whether the mask is effective or not is a separate topic, but it takes little to no effort to wear it, why not? Businesses get compensation for the time they’re forced to close, at least in my country, so that’s a non-issue. And I don’t get the part about mental and physical health. What’s happening to them?</p>
<p>Not going to debate how dangerous it is because that wasn’t my point. My point was that the restriction are easy to follow and I don’t get why fight them so much.</p>

        <p>A non issue? Try telling that to the millions of small/medium businesses that didn’t receive any of this compensation costing them their livelihoods!</p>
<p>Masks are ineffective so why wear one? Do you also still carry your blanket from when you were a child? Because that’s all the masks are comfort blankets.</p>
<p>There are literally thousands of people dying from suicides caused by isolation and loneliness, god knows how many people missing treatments and dying from these ailments that could have been avoided!</p>

        <p>You're aware that most people that died from covid were in the last years of their lives.</p>
<p>At what cost did we close most businesses? Yes some were compensated, people out of work did receive freshly printed money.</p>
<p>I'm worried about the after effects and hyperinflation.</p>
<p>I'm worried about mentally scarring an entire generation. </p>
<p>I'm worried about a precedent being set so governments know how easy it is to enforce their will.</p>

<p>The only mask shown to be effective is the n95 mask, cloth or medical masks don’t work and there is a simple test that will show you, simply put your mask on and fart. If you can smell it your not protected!</p>
<p>Again your numbers come from faulty data, they’ve never separated deaths from Covid and deaths with Covid.</p>

<p>And that’s where you’re wrong, the analogy is bad. What you should compare it to, is shitting your pants. Will it stink? Yes. But the shit itself will stay within your pants. And the same goes for covid. Does the breath itself go through? Yes. But the saliva particles will stay on your mask, and that’s the protection.</p>

        <p>Ok... no... if you can smell the fart (which are relatively large particles) then Covid (which are small particles) can easily get through.</p>
<p>So by your very logic I’m supposed to weaken my own immune system and compromise my health to protect other people who are also wearing masks and doing the same thing? You are aware that we are an oxygen based species and impeding our flow of oxygen literally goes against our very nature, not to mention the very reason we breathe out is to expel carbon dioxide and other microbial bacteria that are harmful to our bodies, if you’re happy rebreathing your own shit then have at it... me I’m on the side of actual science.</p>

        <p>Those few include nearly all of North America, Oceania, and Western Europe, but, as you say, other countries are getting by just fine without such restrictions, so why think they're necessary?</p>
<p>It is indeed a resource issue, caused by flexible tax laws and bad priorities. So, why are we destroying a generation's chance for a normal life? Could we not back-date the taxes the uber-wealthy owe and use existing requisition laws to make up for the shortfall, instead of making the poor suffer and giving the rich heaps of money to prolong it?</p>
<p>Local market means literally that; local markets across the Third World are being closed, meaning 12,000+ per day are dying of malnutrition. All the people who go on about 'saving lives' never give a crap about those lives, and we're called 'selfish' (somehow?) for pointing it out.</p>

<p>It's a start. A step in the right direction. Better than keeping on producing and disposing something in the environment that serves no real purpose in what it's actually supposed to do.</p>

<p>We have already experienced how your "controlled" utopia is and the result is that some people follow the rules while others don't, usually related to how much money they have.

        <p>I'm all for measures if they are scientific and rational. The reaction to covid-19 has never been the census in how we react to highly contagious but relatively mild viruses.</p>
<p>They should have simply advocated for handwashing (which was the norm every other pandemic), suggest that those in risk (immunocompromised and nonagenarians and octogenarians with multiple comorbidities) should limit their contact with other people untill vaccines are produced, and encourage healthy lifestyles like regular exercise, healthy diets and limited substance use like limiting alcohol and smoking (which would improve everyones immune systems and protect them even more if they get infected). Life should have been normal for the most part.</p>
<p>What they did is the complete opposite. They experimented with lockdowns (which have never been done before even for diseases far deadlier than covid, because millions of workers actually have to go to work everyday to keep society running) which now 11 months later only brought enormous destruction to every facet of society and done absolutely nothing in stopping the spread of a highly contagious respiratory virus (excluding the few islands where they can actually be successful - NZ for example, but it's also worth noting that even a success scenario like NZ has brought around 60.000 children into extreme poverty). What lockdowns did accomplish is the biggest wealth transfer in history. They also mandated masks when they had data and studies even from the CDC and the WHO themselves prior to March 2020 showing that masks were never significantly effective at reducing transmission of respiratory viruses (which explains why cases have been surging for months everywhere with mask mandates everywhere) and asymptomatic transmission being virtually non-existent (they don't have enough viral load to infect someone efficiently). They banned gyms and encouraged fastfood takeout and home deliveries (the complete opposite of trying to boost your immune systems). They also convinced healthy people with no symptoms to stay inside their home for weeks/months, limiting their fresh air and sun exposure (which is also vital in having a healthy immune systems - a lot of covid deaths were Vitamin D defficient) and they also contributed to the increase of peoples stress (which can also lower your immune system!) with constant fear inducing and often misinforming news stories. And the worst thing of it all, children lost a year of education and social development from their lives, for something that has no risk at all to them (children are literally 5 times more likely to die from the flu).</p>
<p>Not to mention, all of this for a virus that primarily "kills" nonagenarians and octogenarians with multiple comorbidities. Aka the same people who would die if they got infected by any other mild respiratory virus. Aka the people over their life expectancy.</p>
<p>There was nothing remotely sane about the response to this low IFR virus.</p>

        <p>Flu doesn’t spread nearly as easily as covid, and you could be a symptomless spreader for as much as 2 weeks, it’s not a disease that can be dealt with at an individual level. And masks are effective, otherwise the medical organizations wouldn’t recommend them. </p>
<p>Idk where you live but in my country 2020 had seen 70000+ more deaths last year, the most since WW2, it’s definitely impactful.</p>

<p>It was never even a thing until summer came around and covid just like any other seasonal illness declined to near zero in hospitalizations and deaths in early June.</p>
<p>Then it was created and propagandize into the public’s mind to keep the fear alive and quite literally keep the pandemic alive through mask wearing.</p>

        <p>I never said they were inefective. They have been proven to never be significantly effective. In rare instances where they were actually effective was when they were worn by sick people who actually had symptoms, however the effectiveness was not significant.</p>
<p>If you think masks are greatlly efficient in stopping/reducing transmission, why do you think cases have been surging for months with mask mandates everywhere all around the world?</p>
<p>&rt;be a symptomless spreader for as much as 2 weeks</p>
<p>Like I said, asymptomatic spread has also been proven to be minimal / virtually non-existent. Asymptomatics don't have enough viral load to spread viruses efficiently.</p>

        <p>I don't think the issue is how hard or easy it is to follow the restrictions.</p>
<p>The issue stems more from how out of proportion they seem in relation to the actual danger the virus poses and how further scepticism is fueled by the ever-growing division between the pro- and against sides. Though it's pointless to argue which came first, the sceptics or the supporters, and honestly, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I follow restrictions. Why? Because I have to pay fines otherwise, or worse. Not because I want to follow restrictions. Having to impose restrictions on people based on fear of repercussion is, especially in combination with a virus that, in numbers, is less deadly (but more contagious) than the regular flu, something I disagree with. Especially considering that quarantining everybody, even the healthy, is a great breeding ground for seeing mistrust or outright hostility as virtue.</p>
<p>If restrictions were appropriate for the realistic effects and implications this virus has then I don't think anybody would have an issue following them. Yet here we are.</p>
<p>And I say that as someone who has lived a pretty isolated life for years before lockdowns started. I should be the last one to complain about the current measures, but since they seem absolutely unreasonable to me and since I can see how the restrictions cause more distress than relief, I believe something is off. What it is? I don't know, nobody does. And no, speculating doesn't help.</p>

        <p>I think you are right that there a plenty of people here like that, that are either politically/tribally motivated or have built a defense mechanism. The less rational that make dumb memes or comments attacking "all" of the "other people." But not everybody against lockdowns or masking is like that. "Disprove what is obviously happening" is also very unspecific.</p>
<p>What's obvious to me is that there is a massive theft going on under the guise of a pandemic that is portrayed as far worse than it actually is. I remember being skeptical a few months back talking to my SO, when she said they would find ways to extend the restrictions as long as possible, even mentioning variants as an example of an excuse that might be used. At the time, it just sounded like a baseless theory, but I told her I would remember what she said. And here we are, with several countries adding new restrictions or extending them citing variants, while cases are roughly half or less than half than the peak, millions of vulnerable have been vaccinated, and cases continue to drop. This is when my skepticism was no longer skepticism, and it became incredibly obvious to me that there is an ulterior motive to these actions.</p>
<p>Previous pandemic protocols have essentially been thrown out the window in this case. For example, the UK said that, in an influenza pandemic (although the publication mentioned this could be applied to other respiratory viruses), restricting travel by 90% would only delay the peak by 2-3 weeks and would not be worthwhile, the US illegally used privately funded data without following the right procedure in order to make predictions that are now debunked, countries are using test-based diagnosis rather than symptomatic-based for a respiratory virus, resulting in inflated cases/deaths compared to previous viruses, and many many more examples. These are just some of the things that I've seen in the past few days. You will find people on both sides of political spectrum here who can see the injustice plain as day. The concern is, if so many people are okay with what is happening (often for social/political reasons it would seem), the rich continue to get richer off of this situation, and the poor continue to suffer, where is the incentive to go back to a real normal? I do think this is becoming more visible to more and more people (so many view the vaccine as the end) and the narrative will have to start shifting at some point to avoid too much public unrest, but how long will it take and what will be the extent of the long-term consequences of these restrictions by that point (and, of course, at the point we have already reached)?</p>
<p>By the way, saying the restrictions are not so bad and that you basically live your normal life is an incredibly ignorant and privileged thing to say considering the enormous amount of job loss and growing mental health issues, which should be painfully obvious.</p>

        <p>To answer your question, I deny that the danger of covid is as real as it is portrayed, and this raises the issue of medical coercion - urgent because it is wrong, and already happening.</p>
<p>How many have been told - falsely - that without a vaccine they'll be in danger? What child needs this vaccine? The death rate is .003%. What person below 50? The death rate is .02%</p>

        <p>Nope, I still don’t see a point in being in such denial, be it denial of the pandemic itself or just the measures taken. Sure, we can examine and criticize certain aspects of it, and let me shock you, those in favor of masks and lockdown also do notice some problems like mental health issues, but these do not warrant getting rid of these restrictions whatsoever, because that on a mass scale would be much worse.</p>

        <p>It's not just mental health issues. So you still believe it's justified that hundreds of millions more were pushed into poverty, millions more died from starvation &amp; suicide &amp; overdoses (and millions more will continue to this decade, the economy won't recover in a heartbeat) over a mild respirarory virus that primarily kills those over their life expectancy? I geuss I'll simply never understand people like you.
