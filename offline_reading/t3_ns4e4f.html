    <strong>Did Asians REALLY Comply With Mask Policies? A Critical Look Into Asia vs. The West in Covid-19 Response.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a relatively small nation in Asia, and throughout this lockdown madness I have seen countless posts &amp; references mentioning Asians as having "always wore masks," or how "Asians are so much better at complying because they care more about public health." </p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>reported</em> case and death numbers have been much lower than the West.  </p>
<p>But I'm here to debunk all of this Woke Western Garbage. Conclusion at the bottom if you want the TL;DR. </p>
<p>For reference, I am also an American passport holder that has lived in the United States, Canada, as well as 2 nations in Europe. So I think that I have a fairly good grasp of cultural differences and why things are turning out as they are. </p>
<p><strong>"Asians Wore Masks Before Covid"</strong> </p>
<p>Lol. No. Not really. You'd see it here or there. In 2019 it was less weird to see someone with a mask, but it wasn't as common as these ridiculous woke Westerners would like you to think. </p>
<p>And when we did wear a mask, it wasn't because of a virus with a 99%+ survival rate. It was because of pollution.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ScGt7Y8XLAw/UyxJGpOlG_I/AAAAAAAAEww/w54FlL5WB14/s1600/chiang+mai+burning+season.jpg">Northern Thailand</a> during what's called "Burning Season." Nearly all of Southeast Asia (excluding islands/beach areas) is extremely polluted between February - April because people burn crops, it never rains, and other stuff. </p>
<p>Spend more than a week-long vacation in Asia and you'll be feeling the effects of that. </p>
<p><strong>"Asians Comply With Mask Policies So Well Because They Care About Health"</strong> </p>
<p>Ahh, yes. The typical Woke Westerner that has no understanding of local politics at all. </p>
<p>In America don't wear a mask and you get a slap on the wrist. Maybe a Karen comes up to scream at you. Maybe you get a fine. </p>
<p>Of course, it's gotten much, MUCH worse with Canada and Australia BUT that aside... </p>
<p>In nearly all Asian nations, protest the government and a few black vans pull up, pick you up, and then you disappear. </p>
<p>So yeah, when the government says "put a face diaper on your face," you put a fucking face diaper on your face. You aren't scared Grandma will die of Covid. You're scared that if you protest then the police make YOU disappear and Grandma dies because no one else will take care of her. </p>
<p>The Woke crowd loves to point towards Asian compliance as if it's truly a virtue. You do realize that disagreeing with Authority gets you killed, right? Agreement with and submission to the Elders take priority over truth here. </p>
<p>I dare you. Come over here, put up a sign questioning the government. You'll be lucky to spend a week a jail with half a meal given per day and only a little hard labor. </p>
<p>Even that being said, more and more people are giving less fucks and simply not wearing masks. We play Health &amp; Security Theater over here, wearing masks to enter restaurants and cafes, but behind closed doors (where the government won't see) it all comes off. </p>
<p>In the West you protest with a loud voice and bold action. Protest in many Asian nations is slow and subtle. First you let your mask slip under your nose for a week. Then it gets looser. Then you put it under your chin. Then you wear it on your wrist. So on and so forth. </p>
<p><strong>Cases in Asia are SO Good, OMG They Did Amazing</strong> </p>
<p>Once again, these statements from the Woke crowd are reveal just how clueless and ungrounded they are. </p>
<p>Have you ever heard of "Saving Face?" As I have said earlier, Asian society values submission to the Elders and Authority <em>without a single question.</em> </p>
<p>Our leaders are extremely incentivized to keep the <em>presentation</em> of case numbers as LOW as possible. There are a few reasons for this: </p>
<p>1- Our leaders want to look like competent authority figures in front of us as well as the world. With the entire world freaking out over Covid-19, it's a huge circle-jerk to see which nation can have the fewest reported deaths. </p>
<p>2- You do realize that Tourism is a HUGE industry over here? Foreign money is SO important. Combine this with saving face culture and it becomes imperative to keep the presentation that everything is going just <em>splendid</em> so that the foreigners keep coming in with big wallets, ignorantly cheering on our nation for just how we did in the "Covid-19 Crisis." </p>
<p>Yeah, shut up, and go buy some souvenirs while you're at it would ya? We're kinda gettin' hungry over here. </p>
<p>I know literally NO ONE that thinks my nation's - as well as those around us - have as few cases &amp; deaths are as reported. There are many things to disagree about, and we all have different beliefs, but I have yet to meet someone that truly thinks case numbers are as low as they are here. Of course, this is always whispered... Don't want the police to hear that we're onto them. </p>
<p><strong>Let's Not Forget Something...</strong> </p>
<p>Obesity / personal health is a huge factor in whether or not you die of Covid. The media is sensationalizing India right now for example, but if you look at the death rate, they're doing WAY better compared to the United States. </p>
<p>One thing I'd like the woke crowd to explain to me is this: </p>
<p>How come you justify and sometimes even <em>encourage</em> being fat, but then demand the world cater to you about your fear of catching Covid, a virus with a 99%+ survival rate, even considering the complete and utter lack of health in the average person? </p>
<p>I'm not here to shame anyone. But if you believe that each human's health is their own choice, then you must also accept the risks that come with such an attitude, such as an increased death rate when dealing with viruses. </p>
<p>It's absurd to make yourself <em>more</em> unhealthy, then demand that I stay home and stop going to the gym because you're afraid that you'll catch Covid. </p>
<p><strong>"Where are the protests?"</strong> </p>
<p>Finally, where <em>are</em> the protests? Well, they're happening. Just more quietly. But as we've seen in the West, the media is NOT on your side, and they will not report on even the largest of protests! </p>
<p>Why would we protest in English? That's not the language of our government. So obviously you're not going to see the protests. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion / TL;DR</strong> </p>
<p>The Woke doomer crowd have constantly pointed towards various Asian nations in their "excellence" in the handling of the "super deadly virus." </p>
<p>But their statements only make them look like fools. </p>
<p>Masks were worn for pollution purposes, NOT viral. Disobeying Authority gets you at best a nasty stay in prison or you'll disappear, so obviously everyone has submitted. Finally, "saving face" culture incentivizes covering up of the truth. </p>
<p>Woke Westerners only make themselves look like complete fools when pointing to Asia as having excellent nations. </p>
<p>If you disagree, I encourage you to come on over to Southeast Asia in particular and please protests the government. Let's see how many days you make it. (: </p>
<p>What's going on in the West is absolutely horrifying. Freedom of speech lost. Freedom of agency lost. Freedom of movement. Freedom of religion. </p>
<p>You can vote your way out of Freedom, but getting it back requires you to fight back. Please, I encourage you all to wake up and save your nations while you still can. </p>
<p>What's going on in Canada &amp; Australia are absolutely horrifying. Dare I say reminiscent of 1930's Germany. </p>
<p>I hope that it's not too late, but I also will prepare for the worst.</p></p>

        <p>Where you see masks in Asia:</p>
<ol>
<li>In dust storms; Beijing and area</li>
<li>In heavy smog; rare, but widespread. A lot of folks do have masks ready for such days.</li>
<li>On public transport, which can be incredibly tight packed and worn because it is so incredibly tight packed, some folks choose to wear them to avoid any generally nastiness from getting into them</li>
</ol>
<p>Where you never see masks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Indoors in private buildings, including lecture halls and libraries, cinemas and malls. </li>
<li>To protect others</li>
<li>By mandate</li>

<p>First point of wearing a mask on public transportation according to this article from 2018. </p>
<p>“So what’s the deal with Japan and sickness masks? For years now, masks have been considered good manners. If you got sick, the polite thing to do was put on a mask so others, especially in crowded urban centers, didn’t catch whatever you have.”</p>
<p>Source control to protect others when one is sick. </p>
<p>You’re right about dust and smog.  You’re wrong about them being worn in densely populated areas and that they aren’t used to protect others from you.</p>

        <p>People live in America their entire lives and still think that McDonald’s woman was an idiot that just spilled her coffee on her lap.  </p>
<p>You living in Asia doesn’t mean anything if you’re wrong about how masks work.  People wear them when they’re sick as source control, that’s how they’re supposed to be used.  </p>
<p>Yes, people do wear them thinking they’ll give them protection from others on the bus, and yes they do to a limited degree.  But that’s not their most effective use. </p>
<p>I knew Japanese people wore masks in public when they were sick when I was 10.  Don’t play dumb for upvotes in this doomer sub.</p>

        <p>Lol, living in Asia will tell me:</p>
<p>a. are masks widespread</p>
<p>The answer is no. You linking to <a href="https://Kotaku.com">Kotaku.com</a> does not change that. When I travelled to Japan, I noted:</p>
<p>a. vending machine selling sex toys</p>
<p>b. pachinko machines all over the place</p>
<p>Drawing a conclusion from those 2 things, pachinko and vending machines for sex toys, that they are widespread in Japan would be wrong, let alone throughout Asia.</p>
<p>In your article, they gave 8 or 9 reasons for wearing masks. The fact that a few people in a small geographical area wear them for being polite cannot be extrapolated to all of Asia. You cherrypicked and then extrapolated. You are an ideologue.</p>

        <p>The big problem is using “Asia” as a point of reference.  You saying “I live in Asia” is equally as useless.  Mongolia isn’t Japan which isn’t China which isn’t Thailand.  I fully understand this.  </p>
<p>That’s like me saying I live in North America and saying vaccines are easy to come by.  Canadians and Mexicans are gonna beg to differ.  </p>
<p>I just pointed to Kotaku because it was an article from prior to the pandemic and it gave the primary example of how masks prevent others from getting sick.  </p>
<p>You said people wore masks to prevent getting sick from others.  I provided an article from 2018 that said masks were used as source control by sick people to prevent spread (which current scientific consensus supports).  I did acknowledge people wore masks as an attempt to protect themselves but that’s not their intended purpose or most effective use (unless we’re talking about N-95s).</p>

        <p>Fair enough, but I have travelled to:</p>
<p>Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Phillipines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and China. I lived in the Pearl River Delta region, but also spent extended periods in Thailand and the Phillipines, where I worked and studied, including living in Hainan for a year and Kunming for several months. I have travelled all over China as well. </p>
<p>I do believe this gives me a fairly good grasp of Asia. </p>
<p>Now, it's funny that you speak of my vagueness of Asia though, when you are only talking about a few cities in Japan, which are focused on public transport, which I already said is where you will see most folks wearing them. </p>
<p>Japan is a funny place, and not very representative of most of Asia. They have like 2m men who won't leave their houses.</p>

        <p>If you take a second to actually read and consider your own source, you will see your problem.</p>
<p>\&rt;out of a hundred young Japanese women wearing sickness masks, thirty-one of them were wearing them for show.</p>
<p>Well, the ones doing it for show will do it everyday. The ones wearing them because they are sick will wear one fewer than 10 days per year. </p>
<p>69 x 10 = 690 mask days per year for sick folks</p>
<p>31 x 365 = 11315 mask days per year for show</p>
<p>So, even in one of the only places where people do wear them to be polite, they are far outweighed by folks doing it just for show, according to your own source. Your own source also says many shops prohibit it.</p>

        <p>A minority of women wearing them for show in one poll means that the rest aren’t wearing them as a measure of protection?  People wear fake glasses, does that mean people don’t have bad eyesight?  People wear dumb shit all the time, doesn’t mean the things they wear don’t serve a purpose for most wearers. </p>
<p>Your math makes a lot of assumptions about behavior.  </p>
<p>31 women x 365 days a year?  Lol okay. </p>
<p>Many shops may prohibit it?  So what?  There wasn’t a pandemic at the time so that’s a reasonable request — their shop their rules. </p>
<p>My original point was that people wore masks as source control when they were feeling sick in the past and used Japan as an example.   I partially refuted your point #3 on “where you see masks in Asia” because surgical/cloth masks work as source control.  Do people wear them in an attempt to prevent “generally nastiness” from getting into them, yes.  But that’s not their best usage.  And I refuted #2 on “where you never see masks” because my point and the article explains how people wear masks to protect others when they’re feeling sick.  So your point number 2 about where you never wear masks is wrong.  #3 is weird, not sure why you would see mask mandates before 2020 since there wasn’t a pandemic.</p>

        <p>I can keep doing this. </p>
<p>https://gogonihon.com/en/blog/why-do-japanese-people-wear-masks/</p>
<p>“The first and foremost reason that Japanese people wear face masks is heath. Often times, it’s to prevent one’s own germs or sickness from spreading in public places; a critical point in the often extremely densely populated cities of Japan.</p>
<p>With this many people packed into this small of an area, risk of contagion and disease is much higher. Japanese are taught the importance of prevention at an early age. When I worked in the public school system, it was all over the walls and bulletin boards as posters advocating personal hygiene. Students were made to wear masks when they participated in serving lunch to their peers, and it was always okay to wear a mask at any time if they felt they might be sick.”</p>

        <p>Lol, this is kind of amusing. Out of 4.5b Asians, you have chosen the same subset of people in the same area and again, you have multiple different reasons.</p>
<p>The first is health. Great. In Japan, and Japan alone, a small group of people, mainly in major urban areas wear masks while on public transport.</p>
<p>Congrats. We know. Thanks.</p>
<p>And then there are 4 other reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li>Dust</li>
<li>Covering up</li>
<li>Social Anxiety</li>
<li>Fashion</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, you are not sick very often, but if you have social anxiety, then you'll probably be covering up every day.</p>
<p>This is Japan. Japan is fucking weird. Japan thinks "small face" is a good thing and think masks help them achieve this look. There are millions of people who never, ever leave their home.</p>
<p>You are not doing anything to contradict anything I said, so I really don't understand why you keep choosing the same group of folks to discuss all of Asia. Basically, that's like using Manhattan's parking fees to discuss medieval forms of transportation.</p>

        <p>“Where you never see masks:</p>
<ol>
<li>⁠Indoors in private buildings, including lecture halls and libraries, cinemas and malls.</li>
<li>⁠To protect others</li>
<li>
<p>⁠By mandate”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not arguing this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m saying “you never see masks” doesn’t apply to this point and provided examples.  You’re talking about Asia, I used an example of where you see Japanese people using masks to protect others. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“By mandate” is moot.  Because 2020 happened and many Asian countries have no problem implementing mandates and taking action against the virus. </p>

<p>A few people wear them sometimes. Look at this video of a subway in Tokyo in 2018. It’s hardly a sea of masks.</p>

        <p>…….Because there wasn’t a pandemic?</p>
<p>People would only wear them if they felt sick.  Which you know, most people don’t usually feel sick at any given moment so it’s not surprising you would only see a few. </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/7Di_ohFsiBY</p>
<p>Here’s a video from 2 years ago.  There’s at least 10-15 masks that I saw in this 2 minute clip.  Not too far fetched to see that many people feel under the weather and put a mask on so they’re not breathing on hundreds of other people on the subways.</p>

        <p>The argument that many ignorant people make is not that some Japanese folks wore a mask  when sick. The argument that many ignorant people are making is that ALL Japanese and other A*ian folks were wearing a mask at all times no matter if they were sick or not.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure if that was the argument being made by most people.  I think people were generally trying to point to real world examples of people using masks as a rudimentary and basic method of infection control.  </p>
<p>A lot of these countries have adopted mask mandates in the meantime.  But yeah I wouldn’t try to paint the image of Asian societies collectively wearing masks at all times before this pandemic — that’s a dumb argument to make. </p>
<p>People in this sub get really hung up on mask mandates and they don’t realize that the 5-14 day incubation period for this virus makes it REALLY hard to know who’s healthy or not.</p>

        <p>Because it’s been 15 months of mask mandates, and where I live, people would harass you for not wearing them at the freaking park, and even though the outdoor park mandate has been dropped, there are still people who wear them and jump into bushes and give you glaring looks of rage if you don’t wear one outside. Furthermore, where I live, you still have to wear them at the gym while working out.</p>

        <p>So you believe that the police should walk around and ticket, arrest, or harass people for not wearing masks. And it doesn’t seem to register to you that in states with the strictest restrictions, and highest compliance, like Massachusetts and New Jersey, did the worst. And Los Angeles ended up becoming a covid hotspot. You support a police state, and you support people being arrested, fined, ticketed, and jailed. And you believe that 15 months is “a little while”. Furthermore, India had a very strict and early lockdown, and these restrictions didn’t save them. In India, which is technically a democratic socialist country, millions of people die from poverty and things like tuberculosis every year, but somehow covid ended up being worse and more disruptive.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns and restrictions aren’t a solution.  They’re a means to slow the spread and to prevent everyone getting sick at the same time.  If you relax them and have a shitty healthcare system, you’re gonna have problems which is what happened in India. </p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109004/coronavirus-covid19-cases-rate-us-americans-by-state/</p>
<p>Massachusetts is middle of the pack in terms of cases per capita and New Jersey is currently 12th worst.  Plenty of Red states that did worse and other that didn’t do much better. </p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/</p>
<p>In terms of death per capita, yeah NY, NJ, and MA have the highest rates.  You can probably attribute this to those places surging at the beginning of this pandemic while we were figuring out how to treat this.  But I’m genuinely curious to see why deaths in those states were so much higher than in states like Hawaii, Vermont, Alaska, Maine, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.  </p>
<p>But not taking precautions in NJ, NY, and MA would have led to even more cases and even more deaths.</p>

        <p>I'm all for source control. So if I'm not sick, I don't need to wear one. </p>
<p>My own potentially ignorant quip aside, in Japan masks are not mandated or legally required. During this pandemic, people may shame each other through body-language, but nobody is having a meltdown in an elevator because a courier lady didn't wear the mask over their nose.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yhLUqln9dAI">"My girl here wants me to come out of the elevator so that she can come out of the elevator..."</a></p>
<p>Now, I remember saying to a coworker that the girl "insane" but my he argued that she wasn't. Due to the media, she was convinced that there's this super-deadly pathogen (so deadly that walking 1-feet too close to someone will result in illness and death. I still think she's at least "acting insane" but I can see how she might not actually be insane. This aside, OP has good points about what what motivates people to mask-up in China. The article you provided has some relevance but the method of enforcement/encouragement is different since Japan is not in the business of running concentration camps like the Chinese government.</p>

        <p>I think they're mostly pointing to Japanese culture as Japan had a culture of masks when people were sick as a politeness to others, or during hay fever season. The rest of Asia only wore them during heavy pollution. </p>
<p>However even in Japan, no one really wore it to protect THEMSELVES from disease, they wore it to protect others and they wore it when they were SYMPTOMATIC.  That is instead of sneezing snot all over the table the mask would make it less gross. </p>
<p>In no country did perfectly healthy people walk around wearing masks except during visible pollution.</p>

        <p>This is an excellent point. Even in the cases that masks were worn, it was because it is gross to sneeze/cough on someone and the mask prevents that from happening. Population density is high over here so a cough or sneeze is very likely to land on someone else which is of course very disrespectful in any culture. </p>
<p>But as you clearly pointed out this was done in SYMPTOMATIC individuals. </p>
<p>I’m willing to bet that if the Western powers said “wear a mask if symptomatic because it’s less gross” there would probably be high compliance rates. </p>
<p>Forcing the entire population to wear a mask is just silly.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve head someone argue to me we should do it here because they do it in Asian countries. Not only is that not compelling argument, but it’s not even true as you point out</p>

<p>There are people out there who believe that in A<em>ian countries, </em>everyone<em> was wearing a m</em>sk at all times. However, there is a plethora so much video evidence on YouTube that proves it untrue. In the video from Seoul above, a couple people are wearing them, and that’s during HALLOWEEN. </p>
<p>Here’s another video, from Tokyo:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/9777vipaazY</p>
<p>Like a couple people have them on, but not everyone. </p>
<p>It’s extremely ignorant to assume that everyone was wearing them at all times.</p>

        <p>What a great post.</p>
<p>We need more chinese citizens like you; keep in mind there are bad apples here in the west too that want nothing more than to convince Americans that all chinese folks are bad, but most of us know the majority of you guys just want to coexist. </p>
<p>Keep in mind america is fragmenting more and more by the day.</p>
<p>The woke crowd only composes of 20 percent of America, but the media and democrats want you to believe that it's the majority, and will censor and imprison any dissenting thought that goes against THEIR government and narrative. </p>
<p>The democrats are the CCP, and they're trying to do to America what they did to Venezuela and China. </p>
<p>For the time being, I'm putting my faith in with the texan and Florida governors and senators; and they know if they don't do their jobs, the people residing in those states will. </p>
<p>The sixth of Jan was no riot; the veterans and older people were unarmed, and the only ones who died that day were unarmed veterans, and a cop who died of a heart attack the day after. </p>
<p>Don't believe what the media tells you, you chinese folks are still our friends, but the communist government is ruining everything for everyone.</p>

        <p>The difference in covid19 outcomes between the east and west isn’t masks, or lockdowns or compliance. It’s metabolic health, particularly metabolic health among the elderly.</p>
<p>Well, that and PCR false positives and fudging numbers.</p>

        <p>This should be heard far and wide. Back in early 2020, a coworker used this same argument with me. She said, “But they wear masks in China all the time!” And I said, half-jokingly, “Yeah, and they also aren’t allowed to see what’s on the regular internet.” 
Aaand I see that I spoke too soon there.</p>
