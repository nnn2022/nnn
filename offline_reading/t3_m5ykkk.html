    <p><p>I'm scared guys. I'm not going to get the vaccine because of a host of reasons but lets just say because I'm free to do so, but I just thought of this and I'm worried.</p>
<p>Someone give me a good answer so I can sleep. Thanks all. Love this community.</p></p>

        <p>All doctors won't took it, impossible. Didn't you read all over high percentage of medical staff refusing it? If anything biggest percentage of people who won't take it will be doctors! They know what's going on.</p>

        <p>Google medical device or drug class action lawsuits. There are lots of medical devices and pharmaceuticals which were approved for use, and then issues popped up after it was introduced to the market. If the vaccines have long-term side effects, it will probably be similar. Everything looked fine, until it didn't. (We can already see this happening with AstraZeneca)</p>
<p>In none of those lawsuits did 100% of people drop dead after using the product. Usually, 0.5-15% of people experienced complications or serious side effects. Already with AstraZeneca, it isn't that everybody is getting blood clots--a small percentage is. </p>
<p>I acknowledge that the covid vaccines did not go through the full FDA approval process, and there is an unusual amount of pressure on scientists to deliver good results. I also don't trust that the media and "public health" officials would tell us if something was wrong. However, I don't think you're going to see a large enough percentage of people getting complications that it would seriously threaten our ability to get adequate medical care. I'd be willing to bet most people who get the vaccine will be fine and have a normal lifespan.</p>

        <p>These were specifically shielded by law as part of operation warp speed, and you legally cannot sue "vaccine" manufacturers anyways.</p>
