    <strong>In Canada</strong>
    <p><p>Tin foil hats! With all the firings of military generals lately due to harresment and abuse. Is that what's really going on, or is the government putting their people into place.</p></p>

        <p>If you don't think there's some kind of conspiracy going on to turn Canada into an authoritarian state you just haven't been following developments.</p>
<p>Trudeau wants to use the scamdemic to "win" reelection through mail in ballot fraud. He is pressuring the provinces to go along or the have the emergency response federalized (supposedly), or alternatively all the PHO's are globalist controlled. Certainly all of Trudeau's top people (Tam, Freeland, Hajdu) are all globalist backed by soros and chinese money and deliberately allowed the ViRuS to spread to start cracking down.</p>
<p>Either way we've seen a wave of repression under the bogus auspices of ~~covid-21~~ VaRiEnTs that is designed to make Canada a police state. All of the provinces imposed versions of the same authoritarianism in a line like dominoes and are now trying to make it legal to arrest protestors while the courts are frozen to prevent charter challenges.</p>
<p>Vaccine passports are being rolled out and will happen within a month. The military is being purged probably because of loyalty suspicions.  The leaked document, which to date has been absolutely true, posits they'll be running checkpoints and eventually performing roundups for concentration camps. The army is also running an intensive intel operation on covid protests under the pretense of combating extremism, which apparently also includes counterterrorism network mapping. This is why protests have been "legal" in Canada, confined to facebook, infiltrated in leadership by feds, and encouraged by the way- to map the dissident network before major repression hits.</p>
<p>The RCMP created a false flag in Nova Scotia to restrict firearms purchases shortly before the scamdemic. We've seen "extremists" monitored probably without warrant apparently be set up with mysterious guns and explosives.  I don't doubt they're trying to cook up another one to justify an army rollout.  And once they're in operation it would be very easy to round up dissidents or force vaccination like the UK is doing.</p>
<p>If Trudeau is able to invoke the ~~war measures~~ emergencies act (and he wants to), the army can effectively break up all the protests and completely destroy the political process. Which is why anyone loyal to the nation-state of Canada has to be sacked, or driven out on dirty laundry discovered during surveillance.</p>
<p>When I say the only way out for Canada is mass civil disobedience that throws off all the machinery of government, I mean it. The LPC is at the point of rigging all civil society processes to keep it in power while simultaneously claiming it is "fair". Revolutions have happened over less</p>

        <p>False flags are very powerful. You can pretty much do anything you want afterwards.</p>
<p>For example: banning the president of the United States from Twitter, permanently.</p>
