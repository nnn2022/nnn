    <strong>Now people are more willing to accept Covid deaths and the idea that virus gonna virus. Because they can no longer politicize Covid deaths</strong>
    <p><p>Biden’s comments about not being able to change the trajectory of the virus is eye opening. Imagine Trump saying something like that and all the pearl clutching that would ensue. But no it’s actually rational thought for a rational statement. </p>
<p>That’s because they won’t act like biden personally killed every person that dies of Covid. When Trump was in it was a political strategy to put the blame on him for all Covid deaths and pretend like it would be a massive difference if their favorite politician was in charge. That somehow they would’ve gotten 100 percent cooperation from the population, that somehow the virus would decide to not kill as many.  Of course now they can’t keep that same logic that the president is responsible for all Covid deaths so now inject common sense instead extreme hyperboles regarding Covid. </p>
<p>Personally I never cared for Trump until I saw that the virus effects and  response was being politicized to make orange man look bad and in the crosshairs the working class was fucked over in part of this agenda(remember when they shamed him and anyone else who raised valid concerns about the economy)</p></p>

        <p>Sadly I do agree, it seems that Covid-19 was used as a political tool partially. Now all of the sudden states are talking about opening up and schools want to have kids in class. Hell now Amazon wants to help with the vaccine distribution.</p>

<p>It wasn't a strategy. This is what statists <em>actually</em> believe. In the Bronze Age, they used to sacrifice kings to the personification of the soil if he failed to please her (i.e. there was a bad harvest). Then in medieval times they thought a king's touch could cure scrofula. Now, they think certain taxes can 'please' Mother Nature and she'll give us less hurricanes, or that a certain politician in the White House has a secret 'plan' that will make an endemic virus vanish.</p>
<p>Same shit, different day.</p>

        <p>This is only round 1 of the UN global agenda. Covid-19 is about removing political opposition, forcing public acceptance of the new fake lockdown science and getting social license for censorship. They are just paving the way for the next step.</p>
<p>There will be another virus, another round of lockdowns (now that they've allegedly proven they work) followed by harsher treatment of dissenters. The economic crisis will worsen and they will reshape our society as they see fit to "solve" the problems they caused.</p>
<p>Stay vigilant when they let up, that will be the best time to educate the masses on the lies of the past year</p>

        <p>They’re giving people every reason to believe in a deeper conspiracy. The censorship of contradictory information, the hiding of data, the outright lying. Now we have revisionist historians</p>

        <p>Conspiracy is only a term used to discredit people who question the narrative.  When anything that conflicts with the governments stance becomes a conspiracy the truth eventually becomes clear.</p>
