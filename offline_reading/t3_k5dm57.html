    <strong>“Software deal reveals high level of reported side-effects expected in inoculation" - Financial Times - 1 Nov 2020</strong>
    <p><p>Software deal reveals <strong>high level</strong> of reported side-effects expected in inoculation programme</p>
<p><strong>The types of vaccine being developed by many of the pharmaceutical companies are relatively new, making it hard to predict how they will interact with millions of people’s immune systems</strong></p>
<p>A government contract shows the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority has paid a software company called Genpact UK £1.5m to develop an AI tool to <strong>“process the expected high volume of Covid-19 vaccine adverse drug reaction (ADRs)..."</strong></p>
<p><strong>“You’re talking about vaccines that have potential liabilities, it’s an unknown unknown,”</strong> said Gary Nabel, chief scientific officer at pharmaceutical company Sanofi, which is currently working on two Covid-19 vaccine candidates. “As big as a 30,000-person trial is, <strong>when these go out into the world of millions of people, things will happen.”</strong></p>
<p>___</p>
<p>Even if the risk of adverse reactions (potentially serious and/or life-long ones, is "only" 1 in 1,000, why would any sane person  take that risk, when the risk of hospitalisation let alone death from Covid, even according to the government's very dubious and manipulated statistics, is virtually zero for most people (especially young and healthy people). It is appalling that this toxic cocktail of monkey shite is going to be injected into people without their informed consent. </p>
<p>“It is important to note that a report of a suspected ADR is not proof of a side effect occurring due to the vaccine but a suspicion by the reporter that the vaccine may have caused the side effect,” it added.</p>
<p>Of course - and that bar for "proof" will be set extremely high so as to minimise bad press and keep the dollars flowing as well as to limit any claims for a government Vaccine Damage Payment, which in any event is a measly £120,000 and only payable to those poor souls who will be damaged by 60% impaired mental or physical function. If you're merely 59% vegetable you won't get a penny.</p>

        <p>That’s crazy. Like I suggested, this vaccine will be worse than the virus itself. Stupid fucking people. </p>
<p>Then when people are actually dying in the streets, their fear is justified/</p>

        <p>We don't know that.  Problem is, we don't know that.  What we do know is the data on how lethal the virus is which doesn't warrant an injection of anything, for me at least.</p>

        <p>No but we can almost assume that - Bill Gates is a very smart man. I doubt he thinks we actually need one, but is going to push one anyways. Same with everyone else advocating this on behalf of leadership.</p>

        <p>Indeed. I worry on top of that, that the vaccine will transmit something nefarious to the non-vaccinated. As RFK has pointed out, the flu jab increases transmission of the flu to others.</p>

        <p>If one healthy young person dies from the vaccine all these people have blood on their hands. This is why I don’t think they can actually make the vaccine mandatory.</p>
