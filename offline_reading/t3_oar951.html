<p>&rt; # Associations between body-mass index and COVID-19 severity in 6·9 million people in England: a prospective, community-based, cohort study
&rt; 
&rt; 
&rt; ## Summary
&rt; 
&rt; ### Background
&rt; 
&rt; Obesity is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes after infection with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to examine this association, including interactions with demographic and behavioural characteristics, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions.
&rt; 
&rt; ### Methods
&rt; 
&rt; In this prospective, community-based, cohort study, we used de-identified patient-level data from the QResearch database of general practices in England, UK. We extracted data for patients aged 20 years and older who were registered at a practice eligible for inclusion in the QResearch database between Jan 24, 2020 (date of the first recorded infection in the UK) and April 30, 2020, and with available data on BMI. Data extracted included demographic, clinical, clinical values linked with Public Health England's database of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and death certificates from the Office of National Statistics. Outcomes, as a proxy measure of severe COVID-19, were admission to hospital, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and death due to COVID-19. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, and comorbidities.
&rt; 
&rt; ### Findings
&rt; 
&rt; Among 6 910 695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m2 [SD 5·59]), 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 1601 (0·02%) to an ICU, and 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per kg/m2 from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m2 of 1·05 [95% CI 1·05–1·05]) and death (1·04 [1·04–1·05]), and a linear association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10 [1·09–1·10]). We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for hospital admission 1·09 [95% CI 1·08–1·10] in 20–39 years age group <em>vs</em> 80–100 years group 1·01 [1·00–1·02]) and Black people than White people (1·07 [1·06–1·08] <em>vs</em> 1·04 [1·04–1·05]). The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease than in those without these morbidities.
&rt; 
&rt; ### Interpretation
&rt; 
&rt; At a BMI of more than 23 kg/m2, we found a linear increase in risk of severe COVID-19 leading to admission to hospital and death, and a linear increase in admission to an ICU across the whole BMI range, which is not attributable to excess risks of related diseases. The relative risk due to increasing BMI is particularly notable people younger than 40 years and of Black ethnicity.

<p>&rt;In contrast, people of normal weight under 40 are at essentially no risk of death from Covid. The researchers found their rate to be under 1 in 10,000 per year. Even in the 40 to 59 age range, normal-weight adults had an annual risk well under 1 in 1,000.</p>
<p>&rt;The researchers did not include those stunning findings in the main body of the paper, only its appendix. Still, they were clear in their discussion about the overall results:</p>
<p>&rt; &rt;“Our findings from this large population-based cohort emphasise that excess weight is associated with substantially increased risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes, and one of the most important modifiable risk factors identified to date.”
&rt; 
&rt; &rt;In fact, the findings suggest that for people under 60, weight loss would be the single best way to reduce the risk of Covid - probably even more than a vaccine (and with no side effects).</p>

        <p>The vaccine doesn't just provide protection against serious illness though. It protects against catching the virus which prevents you from transmitting the virus. </p>
<p>Not to mention there would be no way to get people to a healthy weight fast enough to ensure the hospital's wouldn't be overrun with sick patients.</p>

        <p>I've had both shots months ago. I didn't get anything free though! But where I live there is a high uptake of the vaccine so everything is getting back to normal.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the ad. Unfortunately, the only thing I hear is,"my government dictates whether or not I have basic human rights, depending on how they feel that week. I do everything they tell me to so they might decide to let me outside. I am a child and the government is my daddy."</p>

        <p>I'm just at borderline overweight, and I lost close to 10% weight in just 5 months, and I wasn't even trying that hard. It's totally doable.</p>
<p>Let's face it, people would rather take a jab than to fix their diet.</p>

        <p>Oh definitely agree it's doable and people would rather get a jab than work on their weight. The vaccine is so easy I guess people just think there's no reason not to get it.</p>
