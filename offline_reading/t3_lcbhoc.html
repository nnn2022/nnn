    <strong>Someone thinks I'm an idiot for being skeptical of the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Hey, Reddit lurker here. This happened at another forum.</p>
<p>What I said:</p>
<p>"There's been many reports of people having serious side effects and even dying from this vaccine. And the vaccine is said that it's only supposed to reduce symptoms, nut prevent you from catching Covid or stop transmission. I'm not really saying that's for sure. It's just what I've heard.</p>
<p>As much as I want Covid to end, I can't see this vaccine doing much good, if at all, in the long run."</p>
<p>What he said:</p>
<p>"You're an idiot.</p>
<p>There is simply no other way to look at it. There have been very few reports of serious side effects. 104 million people have received at least the first shot. Way, way, way, way, way less than 1% of those have had serious side effects. This shot is slightly more painful afterwards than a flu shot but those aren't serious side effects and are well known.</p>
<p>The two current vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer actually do prevent (in most cases 90~95%) you from catching COVID not just reduce the symptoms.</p>
<p>Again, and I'm sorry for just calling you out directly, but you're an idiot. Do you think these guys are just throwing numbers around? This is real science. These are real numbers based on actual studies. Stop disregarding science.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? This is basic fucking science. To make this statement, you'd have to literally just believe that scientists and governments around the globe are just straight up lying to everyone.</p>
<p>We're already actually starting to see numbers trend downwards in states that have high vaccination rates."</p>
<p>Just wow. I was just being completely civil, and saying what I've heard about the vaccine. I never even stated any of this as a fact. It's not about being an idiot. It's called being a skeptic. What do you guys think? Do you ever get replies like this? What would you say in situations like this?</p></p>
