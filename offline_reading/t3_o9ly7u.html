    <strong>I am scared for the future in more ways than one...</strong>
    <p><p>I think we may go in a semi-Tarantino style of storytelling here.</p>
<p>Let's start with the Wuhan Virus itself. Personally, I remember hearing about it on CONSERVATIVE talk stations in December 2019/ January 2020 well before I heard it on the alphabet news stations. Beyond that, anyone I talked to about it rolled their eyes and though it was crazy, a conspiracy nut. I recall specifically going into the reception area of my office and talking to coworkers about "this virus starting over in china, I hope it doesn't spread over here" I got chuckles and eye rolls. Then it seems, once it became in vogue, or simply politically expedient, the rhetoric became more contagious than the virus itself. In the first few months of the pandemic I read and heard firsthand accounts of nurses or doctors about how deaths having nothing to do with covid were being counted towards covid. The entire world crippled. </p>
<p>Years prior, if not decades, it seems that we have had an unholy alliance between government and business. When I say "we" I'm not referring to just the US, but the entire world. Every company in China exists only serve as a lever of the Chinese government, and croney capitalism is alive and well in the EU as well. The business side of this equation has seemed to be hijacked by advocacy politics- a very small number of constituents puts pressure on a topic, which thereby forces a company to bend in one direction or another. For the last 50 years (or more) there has been a constant drumbeat of how humans are destroying the planet, we need to be restricted and that basically the government needs to control us in order to save the planet. Thank God we elect nothing but Nietzsche's übermench (superhuman) right? Landmark moments like the publication of Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" or <em>Agenda 21</em> and more have made it as plain as day that the goal for many in positions of power (both elected and unelected) is not for the <strong>advancement</strong> of the human race, but the inevitable engineered decline of the human race. </p>
<p>But wait! The clouds have parted! There is hope! It's a bird, it's a plane, no, it's an untested vaccine being given to the entire population with little to no question! </p>
<p>As if it weren't already painfully obvious that the majority of the US, if not the world are complacent obident drooling dullards- 2020 put that debate to rest. Put this mask on- ok. Stay 6 feet apart- okay. Close down your small business- okay. Keep your kids out of school to the detriment of their mental health- ok. </p>
<p>Now take this vaccine that was developed in less than a year and has virtually no clinical trials proving it's safety- <em>will I be able to take my mask of and go back to life as normal?</em> -Maybe. <em>Jab me now!!!</em></p>
<p>The fact that this vaccine has side effects that are <strong><em>not</em></strong> being taken seriously including the effects on women's menstrual cycles, heart swelling of minors, and memory issues. Who knows what side effects have yet to come into the light. </p>
<p>About those memory issues- coincidence that the only alzheimers drug to be approved since like 2003 was approved right after the vaccine started going? And it allegedly cleans the proteins out of the brain- like the spike proteins. </p>
<p>I honestly believe that the last 50 years have been a slow build to this, and the pandemic was a huge leap forward in government control and population control. In the future there will be two roads, the vaccinated population, and the unvaccinated. Time will tell how nature treats us both.</p></p>

        <p>I'll add one note...</p>
<p>In my line of work we started talking about / making jokes about the China Virus +/- October 2019...</p>
<p>The rest?</p>
<p>You are pretty spot on.</p>

        <p>Wow. I too remember hearing it mentioned early, like in December 2019 going into January 2020 as well, and that the death rate was at 2% at that time, which was quite high, as the flu is normally about 0.2% and how serious it was. I didn't think a lot of it, but that it was something to be cautious about and monitor the situation in Wuhan. It was the butt of so many jokes in February. I guess it just made me that much more skeptical when people started to lose their minds over it in March, and I looked in vain for bodies piling up and didn't see any.</p>

        <p>Yes, then we started needing to get tests for a virus that was SO DEADLY that you need a test to see if you even had it. Then because that deadly virus was SO DEADLY, the bodies piling up, we just had to rush a vaccine for this virus that most people didn't even know they had!</p>

        <p>I’m positive that a family member had it in November. I’m sure plenty of others did as well, we were just seeing an accurate display of what occurs; 99%+ will be fine. They also weren’t testing people who had 0 symptoms so…</p>

        <p>Correct. I assume you know all about the Great Reset/WEF, Agenda 2030/UN Sustainability, Kalergi Plan, CFR, etc etc. This has clearly been planned for centuries at least, it’s out in the open now &amp; much of it always was. Personally I think it goes back several millennia but there is just so much info &amp; disinfo to wade through &amp; discerning what is truth gets more difficult by the moment.</p>
