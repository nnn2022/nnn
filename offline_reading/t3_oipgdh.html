        <p>Cancer mystifies me, people are just going through their lives none the wiser they have it until they see a doctor who tells them oh we found cancer, then the treatments begin their lives turn to shit and they’re usually dead in a year or two. Everyone just runs to the chemo machines, if you hadn’t gone to the doctor you wouldn’t know it’s there anyway. I’d rather just live me life healthy and if it’s gonna kill me fine but I think I have a better chance of living longer with it than hanging out in Chernobyl’s reactor 3 for an hour every week.</p>

        <p>Most "healthy" people are walking around with a gut full of parasites and they don't even know it, since anti parasitic foods have been eliminated from the standard Western diet. Many diseases are probably caused or worsened by them.</p>
<p>Instead of dog medicine though you can get some pretty good herbal parasite cleanses online. They did wonders for a bunch of skin issues for me and overall health, and in the early days i could see small white things in the er.. poop. This is for someone who was always generally fit and healthy overall.</p>
<p>This is probably why Ivermectin is unknowingly helping people with Covid. Not because it's curing a "virus" (which hasn't even been isolated and are just strands of RNA found in people), but because its getting rid of parasites causing a lot of underlying disease.</p>

        <p>Microscopic worm eggs get on hands or under nails and are ingested due to the prevalence of "hand food" like burgers and pizzas nowadays. There's a reason knives and forks were invented. </p>
<p>Of course you don't need cutlery if your diet regularly consists of anti parasitic foods like black walnuts, pumpkin seeds, fennel seeds, fermented foods etc., but the western diet is lacking in these nowadays and heavy on meat and sugar, which most parasites thrive on.</p>

        <p>Ey! Glad you liked it 🙏 cancer is such a horrible thing, and the best thing big Pharma can come up with is pumping us with radiation, it’s just the most insane way i can think of to try and get rid of it(Not that i have a better solution, maybe ivermectin?) They have the real cure hidden away, maybe cancer actually is a parasite! I don’t trust anything these criminals say.</p>

        <p>The way they are treating cancer now should be considered criminal.  The solution is almost always invariably to put people through a chemo regime which if the cancer doesn't kill them, the chemo certainly will.  It will certainly make years of their life miserable.  </p>
<p>There are plenty of other suggested alternative methods.  Dr. Otto Warburg discovered back in the thirties a relation because anaerobic activity in the cells and tumour growth.  This means general toxicity leading to the body's cells not being able to properly "breath"; there are plenty of low risk, non-invasive suggestions for how to treat this.  Dr. Warburg won the Nobel Prize in the thirties.</p>
<p>Dr. Linus Pauling discovered a link between Vitamin C and cancer.  His theory was giving super doses of Vitamin C to patients.  Perhaps the Vitamin C helps the body oxigenate the cells.  Perhaps Vitamin C helps the immune system to identify and fight off cancerous growth.  This has been used with great success on scores of patients.  Dr. Pauling has won a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>I've heard cancer being compared to a fungus growing in the body.  Simple baking soda has been shown to limit cancer tumour growth.  Cancer researchers know this, but claim this isn't a practical method because the baking soda could never "make it past" the body's hydrochloric acid in the stomach.  But many people have tried and have reported favourable results.</p>
<p>The actual truth about cancer, is the current medical system has absolutely no clue with how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps more insidious.  They want to make money off of cancer.  They tell people it is terminal, then give them a cocktail of expensive chemo drugs paid for by the government.  They make thousands of dollars off a cancer patient, translating into billions for the industry over the year.  And it isn't even that effective.  Many people submit to chemo, lose months or years of their lives in miserable, crippling pain, imagine vomiting all day long for an entire day, losing your hair and barely being able to walk.  And they say this is "curing" you.  The great part is if the person dies from this, they can just say it was the cancer.</p>
<p>The business of cancer is a racket.  They are preying on the vulnerable.  This has been known for decades.  It's like an insider secret, but nobody says anything.  Because nobody dares take on the Medical Industrial Complex.</p>

        <p>There are too many variables in the equation to know what helped imo.</p>
