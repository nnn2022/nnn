    <strong>So I'm guessing Texas, and Florida are the only good states to move to? Is there hope for New Hampshire or maybe even Georgia? Because I need to leave New Jersey...</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously, can someone give me advice? Tell me the pros and cons of living in these two states? I was originally going to move to New Hampshire or maybe even Georgia. I don't know anymore, this world has become too much.</p>
<p>Fucking New Jersey is terrible...I hate it here, I need somewhere to go soon or later. I'm tired of this shit state and it's dumbass mandates, it's too expensive to live here, the people here are terrible, I could on forever...but I won't.</p></p>

        <p>PA is definitely better than NJ, especially the rural counties (I live in one), but even I am looking to move south. The problem with the rural counties in PA is that there are limited economic opportunities here and you can't fully escape from Wolf's bullshit even in a red county.</p>

        <p>I guess it depends on what you do for work. I currently live in TX and was contemplating moving to PA. Although that may sound crazy given the current times, a very good friend is moving to that area and family is closer so there are those things to consider. I was planning on making a trip up there so see how life is around there and how nuts people are. We'd go to a local grocery store, gym, bowling alley, etc without masks, etc. to determine the amount of pushback or confrontation with questions about our vaccine status. I guess the only scary thing with moving to that area is related to work in terms of questioning whether employers will require proof of vaccination to be able to work let alone being forced to wear a mask. Around in TX, there's less of a chance for that.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it depends where you are in PA. The closer you get to Philadelphia the worse it will be, outside of that you have Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and State College. I'm close to State College and they have had a mandatory mask (indoor and outdoor) rule for the past year and they actually enforced it with $300 fines. I think they relaxed things a bit after the latest CDC guidance. I don't know anyone who's employer has required a vaccination yet. My wife is a hospice social worker and she's not vaccinated, she can't go inside certain nursing facilities though. Masks inside workplaces are a thing. In the plus column we just passed two State constitutional amendments which let the legislature unilaterally end disaster declarations, which means come early June Wolf will have no ability to keep up his health mandates.</p>

        <p>Yea I was watching that vote very closely. If PA voted against it I wasn't even going to look twice at the state. I'm curious as to what's going to happen though once those amendments are put into motion. Is there going to be a legal struggle or will that piece of trash be put into his place?  </p>
<p>That's good about your wife though, hopefully it stays that way. I have to say it's really bad from what I'm seeing about educational institutions. It seems like every college or university is requiring proof of covid vaccination while in TX none require it (maybe one but no one cares about that one). In TX, even with the mandate, the amount of people wearing them and not wearing them was about 50%. Keep in mind I live in a red county in the DFW metroplex but, excluding one time at a grocery store, was not hassled about wearing one. I'm making a trip up there to check if the same applies for counties up there like Lancaster, Lebanon, etc.</p>

        <p>The amendments were passed because the legislature voted back in December to end Wolf's Covid mandates, but he vetoed their bill and the PA Supreme Court (which solidly blue) ruled that he had the power to do that even the the state constitution didn't specifically say he did. I'm not a legal scholar, but I'm pretty sure there isn't much ground for him to challenge the amendments. He has said that he will respect the will of the voters or something. This does pass the power to the legislature, but it's solidly red in both houses so I fully expect June 7th (when the vote is certified) to be the end the state mask mandates etc. Businesses still have the option to require masks though.</p>
<p>Lancaster/Lebanon etc. are red counties, but they are more blue than were I am and I bet where you are now. I don't think you will be hassled about wearing a mask though. One nice thing about that area is that you have a lot of Amish/Mennonite businesses and they ignored all this Covid garbage from the very beginning. </p>
<p>If you have kids that you plan to send to public school you might want to do some more research, I don't know of specifics there, but here (which is a lot redder) kids had to wear masks to school all year and some districts even required it for athletics.</p>
