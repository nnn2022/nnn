    <strong>Have you watched the new movie Songbird? (Covid-23)</strong>
    <p><p>If you haven't watched, here's the trailer:</p>

<p>If you have, what is your take on the movie? Do you believe it's hinting at potential future outcomes? Possibly hinting at current events? </p>
<p>\&rt; Covid-23: Does this tell us we won't be free for a long time? More Covid is to come? A big event in 2023? </p>
<p>\&rt; I thought it was interesting how they use Q-zones. In the movies, they refer to these sites as "Quick Death". The military comes and hauls you away if you fail your temp check. This device they use is supposed to diagnose your condition by thermal scanning your face. There were some moments where they talked about the virus targeting or affecting your brain. Relation to FEMA camps? Vaccines? Upcoming strains? </p>
<p>\&rt; They refer to immune people as "munies". Some munies are good, some bad, some have fake immunity bracelets. Many people despise the munies for having freedom. Of course, the people in charge are depicted as evil and corrupt. It seemed to show that once you are declared immune, you're free from lockdown rules indefinitely. </p>
<p>\&rt; The streets are filled with military reinforcement. The city is in shambles. </p>
<p>\&rt; Near the end, the main girl makes the correlation that she is immune, yet she has been locked down for who knows how long. Are more people immune than we think? </p>
<p>Give me your take on the movie. I'm just speculating and brainstorming.</p></p>
