        <p>People almost or hurting themselves to avoid me. I won't retype it again.. </p>
<p>Basically people scared of me walking down the street and either doing wide swaths around me, as they walk into the street, or down off the street into the ditch.. and the hijinx that ensues.. So dumb and fearful.</p>
<p>Lately it's just wide eyes as I walk into the store (Because mandates gone) and their shock and horror that I am going about my day, free as a bird, after they got away with 12 months solid of screaming at me, threatening me and calling the cops on me.</p>

        <p>Nothing particularly crazy, just people either walker a good distance off the sidewalk into the grass or walking along the curb in the street to avoid directly passing by me. If neither of those were an option due to walking down a busy street I saw someone walking down the sidewalk back up and wait in an alley for me to pass by them.</p>

        <p>Only one person ever said anything and that was â€œfellow patriot â€œ. They were not wearing one either. 
In fairness I am a rather scary looking individual with a face only a mother or dog could love. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p>

        <p>Not from me but my friend and some other people were at a skatepark, most likely without masks and not distancing and whatever, and a car apparently full of Karenâ€™s pulls up and starts threatening to call the police. They did and am officer showed up and could care less. He was very friendly started to have some conversations with the people at the skatepark</p>
