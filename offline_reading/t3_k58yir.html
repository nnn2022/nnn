        <p>There are even people wearing them alone in their car. </p>
<p>It is fucking mindblowing that the government can force us to cover our face!! I want to breath clean air, I already had corona and my immune system handled it just fine. </p>
<p>Our government created this emergency law that enables them to make new rules at will without the house of parliament getting a say or being able to vote against it. This is no longer democracy. I'm scared what this will mean for my own and my daughters future</p>

        <p>Parliament voted in an emergency law that gives a few ministers almost absolute power over the country in the name of public health. Parliament doesn't have much of a say in the matter for the next months. Lawyers all over the place call it 'a monster of a law'.</p>

        <p>The same here too. And the police are checking to see if everyone respects the “rules”, abuse of power more like. It is a total clown show. Retards nagging on the street to cover your nose too not just the mouth. The stupidest thing was fining people that are on a freaking mountain skiing - for not wearing a mask. Not to mention recently i went hiking near a forest and there were people walking all equiped and with masks on ffs! I feel like imma have a nervous breakdown from this shit.</p>

        <p>Even that!
Two stories. 
1.We have a small community with kids hanging out for the last six or seven months. Free spirited people with kids. Mostly no-one wears a mask. Trying to keep it as less stressful for kids as possible.Reminds me of Begnini movie where he played with his kid in concentration camp.Cops came, said someone reported us. Asked us politely to "disperse". No fines. </p>
<ol>
<li>Family in park in other city. Fined! All of them. 1200 Euros.</li>
</ol>
<p>So it all comes down to being a human.</p>

        <p>Before they made mask wearing mandatory, about 50% of the people wore a facemask by choice.
Most people still went out shopping, to the gym, visiting family etc. Now that it is mandatory everyone wears a facemask. Most people I talk too are really scared as well and can't wait to finally get the vaccine.
There are still some sane people left but not alot unfortunately.</p>

        <p>No I didn't mean that. Although I can see how you got to that. By sane I mean the people who still do some critical thinking and don't just blindly follow the rules just because they were told.</p>
<p>It is not only about the mask either. It is about the mass hysteria that is being created for a virus. And yes, that virus is more deadly than the flu. But to whom and why?</p>
<p>If you look at the statistics you see most people who die from corona are the elderly (70+) most of the time these people are fragile and have comorbidities. A simple flu would have likely killed them as well but we have a vaccine for that.</p>
<p>For younger and healthy people corona is not nearly that deadly. I want to be careful with numbers cause we don't know how to calculate exactly at this moment. But let's be very generous and say the mortality rate for someone under the age of 60, in a healthy state is 5% (that is very generous). Does that justify all this fear mongering, the mandated mask wearing, the lockdowns, the destruction of small businesses? 
I don't think it does personally but we can disagree on that point.</p>
<p>I am not saying only the elderly die of this virus.
There are young and healthy people who die from corona but there are young people who die from a lot of stuff and a lot of those are way deadlier than corona. 
Losing a loved one is always difficult, no matter the age and it is heartbreaking and it sucks, but at the same time it is a part of life.</p>
<p>Sure we can be a bit more careful now and try to protect those who are weaker. But the mass hysteria and the lockdowns and the not seeing your family for an entire year is a bit over the top. To me, and to a lot of people. And when the government gets involved and tell us how to behave it gets a bit scary and dystopian.</p>

        <p>This happened in Ireland too. And the WHO has just released new guidance <a href="https://www.freepressseries.co.uk/news/national-news/18914645.coronavirus-updates-guidance-mask-wearing/">https://www.freepressseries.co.uk/news/national-news/18914645.coronavirus-updates-guidance-mask-wearing/</a></p>
<p>Honestly this is going nowhere. Masks will be here in 2 years I reckon. Good job I started out not wearing them as it's easier to go on resisting. I do wear a scarf up on my nose just as I would in winter on crowded trains but spend 98 percent of my life not wearing masks! Nice!</p>

        <p>This is soooo sick! I just can't comprehend how other people don't see how fucked up this is! </p>
<p>I spend some time looking at statistics about deaths in the Netherlands and I have to be honest we had more deaths in march/april than we normally do (during lockdown!!!), but the rest of the year it has been normal.
We have had approx 10.000 more people die this year compared to other years. And although that is incredibly sad, it is not a lot on 17 million people and I believe it doesn't justify a lockdown and mandated mask wearing. </p>
<p>Oh yeah and most of those people (almost all) were 70+ of age and had comorbidities.
I'm not saying these people didn't matter, cause they were someones dad, grandmother, son, sister etc but ruining the economy, throwing a country into lockdown etc etc.... just no</p>

        <p>Hmm.  </p>
<p>I was looking at <a href="https://imgur.com/a/RRzWSqp">Netherlands Covid death profile</a> to see if things had already started to go down, and I thought of something.</p>
<p>I notice that on the graph there is a downturn at the end of the deaths.</p>
<p>But I have heard that is the result of reporting lags.  Data from the past 2 weeks is not all in yet, and as it comes in that "falloff" gets "filled in".</p>
<p>Ok ... so I thought of something.  Doesnt that mean that at the authorities kind of have a "2 week head start" with the data?  Reports come in to them, and then they put that up on the public data ..</p>
<p>.. but for the 14 days preceding today, the government had a much more complete picture of the Covid curve, and they simply haven't entered the backdated deaths on the "public record".</p>
<p>So .. is that how they could stay "2 weeks ahead of the curve"?</p>
<p>They would be able to see a downturn before the data gets compiled for the public and "filled in".  </p>
<p>In that way, they could respond to trends that are not visible to the public yet.  Like enacting stricter restrictions when they already see the numbers starting to go down, in order to take credit for that.</p>
<p>What do you think?  Is that what is happening?</p>

        <p>I don't know. Could be, could not be. I don't know how they make decisions, what that process is like.
And I am not sure they have that kind of data 2 weeks ahead of the general public. I want to believe they don't. And I don't really want to step into the conspiracy theories waters.</p>
<p>I do think they like the kind of power they have arm. If they are misusing that? Not sure. Maybe they really do think they are doing what is best for the general public and our health. Let's try to stay positive :) </p>
<p>But I don't think the data justifies all the laws and rules they are implementing, whether that data is accurate or 2 weeks late.</p>
