        <p>I am 1000% against death threats. Doesn’t make any sense to me to do it because it can land you in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>He does need to understand, however, that he is in a sense the face of the absolute destruction of millions of American lives that never would’ve been destroyed by this virus. He supported lockdowns and called it an “inconvenience” that people lost their life’s work in a matter of months. And he doesn’t comprehend that many people would prefer death to what befell them thanks to his consultation and suggestions.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with death threats but I do agree that it’s fair to loathe him and blame the destruction of our society and everything we love and this seemingly unending barrage of fear and misery on him in conjunction with governors. Full stop.</p>

        <p>This is the problem with experts in one field, especially ones like Fauci that the media love to grandstand. They're so innately dedicated to their particular area that they fail to consider anything else in their analysis. </p>
<p>In a perfect world, we would have experts from multiple fields guiding public policy, but that would take way too much effort and potential dissent for the media to do.</p>

        <p>Yeah I was being facetious about the "wimp" part, but c'mon. Death threats are inherently stupid when done over the internet imo, if someone is actually going to hurt you why are they hiding behind a screen to tell you that?</p>
<p>IMO this is 100% expected with the nightmare he's caused America though. It's not okay by ANY means but you can't destroy millions of lives and expect everyone to be happy about it.</p>
<p>Also would like to point out that although I would consider myself a leftist, I have only received one death threat from a conservative EVER - the few others have all been (seemingly) leftists. I thought we were supposed to be the "accepting" and "tolerant" people?</p>

        <p>When a lot of people are angry at you, Fauci, it typically means you did something wrong. And you did.</p>
<p>But hey, I understand your plight, I just went to the r/fuckfuckmasks subreddit and saw a comment saying “Kill that bitch” in regards to some non-believer he or she never met. </p>
<p>Indeed, it’s difficult when people are hurling insults and death threats at you. Do you see what you contributed to here? Rhetorical question, I know you do.</p>

        <p>as a Canadian, honestly given a country with so many guns, I'm surprised  America has so few assassination attempts on public figures on every side of every issue , let alone threats. You'd think there'd be a grassy knoll behind every blade of grass.</p>

<p>This is it, gun owners are not crazed killers, that is leftist propaganda. Most gun owners are like my self,  realistically all I want to do is punch holes in paper, make loud bangs, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFd3kF6LHz4">make the gong go "PING."

        <p>Yes, and there were plenty of new restrictions for the COVID-19 “precautions”.</p>
<p>Not to mention, you are forgetting the consequences of assassinating a public figure, and how well the fear-mongering propaganda works. (Hint: It works really really well.)</p>
<p>Edit: The precautions I’m referring to are the ones regarding gun sales, for instance, placing limitations on ammo, or skyrocketing prices. The media hardly talked about it, but there were multiple new rules and legal impediments  for firearms with the excuse of COVID-19. Sorry for not being more specific, I should drink my coffee next time.</p>

        <p>We all have the right to criticize him and what he's been pushing for, but if anyone here has ever gotten even close to sending Fauci a threat, they should know that anything like that is absolutely out of order, counterproductive to ending lockdowns/restrictions, and is altogether an absolutely unacceptable, evil thing to do.  He needs to hear from us, but not at all in that way.  Think of it like any argument:  if they've gotten under your skin enough for you to resort to threats, it's a sign you've run out of good arguments and they've really won.</p>
