    <strong>Time is of the essence; what can we do in to take action?</strong>
    <p><p>Firstly, before we get banned or quarantined as a subreddit, we need to still continue to connect somewhere. </p>
<p>Possibly off social media. </p>
<p>We are going to need to take action. We will be needing to storm the streets of major cities across the country protesting our resistance. </p>
<p>We need to be as organized as them. No one is useless. There is always something you can do with your skill. </p>
<p>The US is slowly taking away our freedoms, this is what its been about the whole time. They’re already slowly taking away our guns and getting comfortable requiring us to comply with their ridiculous demands. Its about power and control, not the safety of the people and their not about to stop pushing. </p>
<p>Their strategy is to slowly push, hoping we just don’t notice, and when people resist they push back a bit, wait a while, then push harder the next time around. </p>
<p>They’re going back to masks now but eventually they will go develop to a vaccine that ‘does’ work. If you ask me, masks were never about stopping the spread, they were all are about submission just like the vaccine. The stay at home orders and putting everyone on unemployment were about destroying the economy. </p>
<p>If there is really anybody we should be pointing fingers at, its the ‘Elites,’ Biden, the CCP, and other corrupt governments around the world abusing their people, who have strategically created or encouraged this virus and spread it across the world in order to carry out their plan of getting the entire world to submit out of fear. The release of Corona virus, was no accident, anybody who actually believes it was bat soup is a fool. This was a genius, well thought out design to commit mass genocide and strike fear in people’s hearts. This was the start of a war. They were hoping to get away with killing people without blood on their hands. </p>
<p>If you think all the events that followed this virus around the world is a coincidence, its not. BLM before election year, Hong Kong’s riots, Cuba’s resistance to their government, South Africa’s looting, the Chinese Social Credit System and so on was no accident. The occurrence of these events, the division of the people during the pandemic, is no coincidence. </p>
<p>We will be resisting again and fighting back in the same position we are now when a new improved vaccine is developed. They will slowly make it mandatory for people to take the new and improved vaccine, they will assume there should be no excuses because it works. They will start by saying you can’t go to work, then school, then the the grocery store, its about segregation. Its not about whether the vaccine works or not, it never was. We need to be ready for this fight and we need to be organized and strong. </p>
<p>There are those with families that are struggling to decipher whether or not they should fight the vaccine mandates their workplaces are putting in place, it’ll be an even bigger push when the vaccines are improved. Lets fight for them and our country before it goes too far. If you can afford to leave your job if it come down to that (hopefully it doesn’t), help us fight.</p>
<p>If some of us don’t stand up now it’ll be a lot worse for the future. Its not like we want a war or that we all desire chaos, but I also don’t want to be living under a social credit system in a few years either because it will happen. We need to come together with other countries and fight this, the resistance is not just among Americans. We in this community are not crazy, we see it for what it is.</p></p>

        <p>We do not win anything by tearing down the corrupt system of global governance.</p>
<p>We win by opting out and building a humane system without the parasitic governments attached to it. When we start a better civilization by welcoming all people ready to live on the foundation of real freedom again, we drain the parasites.</p>
<p>You should abandon your illusion that any major movement that is ultimately "pro-reform" and "pro-system" is going to be "pro-freedom". Left and right is the corridor set by the enemy.</p>
<p>The same enemy that has coopted every government and every opposition to government you have mentioned.</p>
<p>There is only one way out of this. Freedom. Direct action. Grassroot democracy.</p>
<p>Every central authority will eventually do what has happened now.</p>

        <p>Count me in. We need a platform where we can communicate with each other in case (when) this sub goes down. I’m hanging out in the white rose group in telegram, does it ring a bell?</p>
