        <p>Exactly. And I think this writer illustrated this quite well too.</p>

        <p>SOURCE: 
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/briefing/outdoor-covid-transmission-cdc-number.html</p>
<p>https://archive.is/ubxfc</p>
<p>"When the Centers for Disease Control released new guidelines last month for mask wearing, it announced that “less than 10 percent” of Covid-19 transmission was occurring outdoors. Media organizations repeated the statistic, and it quickly became a standard description of the frequency of outdoor transmission." [...]</p>
<p>"In truth, the share of transmission that has occurred outdoors seems to be below 1 percent and may be below 0.1 percent, multiple epidemiologists told me." [...]</p>
<p>"That benchmark “seems to be a huge exaggeration,” as Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist at the University of St. Andrews, said. The rare outdoor transmission that has happened almost all seems to have involved crowded places or close conversation." [...]</p>
<p>"Saying that less than 10 percent of Covid transmission occurs outdoors is akin to saying that sharks attack fewer than 20,000 swimmers a year. (The actual worldwide number is around 150.) It’s both true and deceiving." [...]</p>
<p>“These recommendations would be more grounded in science if anywhere close to 10 percent of Covid transmission were occurring outdoors. But it is not. There is not a single documented Covid infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions, such as walking past someone on a street or eating at a nearby table.”</p>

        <p>Of course there isn't. It's a damn cold virus, you this by being in close and extended contact with someone that has a cold. There's a reason people would get these by going to school/uni/work or from riding public transport and not by eating at a restaurant or walking past someone with a cold. People that have a cold don't magically turn into some water sprinkler that spreads viral particles in a .69m radius.</p>
