    <strong>The WEF</strong>
    <p><p>What I find very disturbing is the rhetoric coming from the WEF tries to appeal to ordinary people that the future will be fantastic with all this new tech and green lifestyle, but in the background there is this Agenda 2030 that will focus on reducing civil liberties and moving everyone into highly controlled ghettos, out of the rural areas, introducing social credit scores and controlling all aspects of our lives. What gets me is that their Orwellian plans are backed by the worlds top companies who just see us all as a commodity.</p>
<p>Maybe the way to fight back is to target these individual companies - campaigns to let them know their customers aren't happy about their involvement with the WEF Agenda and try to encourage people to buy goods from companies not in the WEF. It would be a huge task to convince people to come on board with this campaign especially with internet censorship that will attempt to stop the word getting out.</p></p>

        <p>From what I've seen the WEF is 100% disconnected both from reality and from the people they are trying to appeal to.</p>
<p>Also, I think the boycott train left a good while ago. At this point in time it's probably too late to just boycott.</p>
<p>Too late + most people not even being aware of the WEF = very, VERY little effect. In fact, people think the WEF and the great reset are conspiracy theories, when in fact they are very open with what they are doing.</p>
<p>That's how little is known among the regular citizen about the WEF. And I think they even like it better that way. Imagine plastering billboards with the WEF and telling everybody. I think that would give them a little bit too much exposure and more than maybe just 20% of the population would be sceptical, meaning more pushback leading to (maybe) less restrictions and a return to normal if the ideas are just refused.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a good thing to make people aware of the WEF. Maybe not. Who knows.</p>

        <p>Yup, till now people still say WEF is just a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Bruh, they won't even bother if you tell them to check out the videos and even their MAIN FUCKING PAGE of blatant agenda pushing. My god the ignorance sure is thick.</p>
