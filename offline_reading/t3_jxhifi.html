    <strong>Bombard Edmonton city council with anti mask emails tonight!</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure many of you have heard the awesome doctor at a city council meeting in Edmonton last week speaking some truth to Edmonton city council about PCR tests and masks. After that meeting there was supposed to be a second meeting tonight to let other people have their say, but they cancelled it. Tomorrow the city council is meeting to vote on whether to extend the mask bylaw past the end of December when it expires. Let's just say I'm not too optimistic that they will stop the madness. But maybe if they get a flood of emails tonight some of them will vote against it!</p>
<p>Here's the link to all the city councilors here, I'm guessing most of them should have an email address to contact them. https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/city-councillors.aspx</p>
<p>I know you may not be from here, but if freedom reigns here, hopefully it will spread!</p></p>

        <p>I wear a mask to prevent disease ridden people from infecting me. Fortunately,  you can tell who these people are as they don't want to wear masks. Making masks mandatory does make it more difficult to determine who the fools are, but maybe ignorance is a bliss. Keep your mask on you crybabies.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure you're in the wrong sub there bud. Also, wearing a mask does very little to protect you from getting a virus. Check out the new Danish study, the first RCT study for masks and covid. The results showed little difference in infection rates for the people wearing masks vs. those not wearing masks.</p>
<p>If wearing a mask makes you <em>feel</em> safe, go ahead and wear one. Just don't force them on everyone else.</p>

        <p>I am in  the right sub. If you only attract people who agree with you, then you just get one sided information.  Talk about confirmation bias.</p>
<p>I read the summary of the Danish study. I have read enough literature in journals though that you have to read complete reports to get the full disclosure. For example, I  don't recall if the masks were only recognized n95 or surgical or masks made of cotton t-shirts.  Did the subjects follow social distancing? One study is not a trend.</p>
<p>From other reports I have read, masks decrease your likelihood of being exposed by about 60 percent if someone has a coughing fit but more than 90 percent if the person with the coughing fit is also wearing a mask. So, if you feel the need to go maskless, do it in your home or outside walking in a quiet neighborhood.  If you are in a store, just keep it on. If you are on a bus or in a hospital, I think you are nuts not to wear one.</p>
<p>Just be thankful that most surgeons now follow germ theory and are willing to wear masks when cutting you open.</p>

        <p>Well I am a considerate person, so if I'm in danger of having a coughing fit, eg. I'm sick, I stay home. I don't rely on a mask to protect others. I have not been sick a single time since last Christmas, so my going out without a mask is endangering exactly zero people. Except maybe myself, but I'm willing to risk getting sick. And if I do, I'll stay home.</p>
