    <strong>Trolls</strong>
    <p><p>The trolls are out in full force today. They‚Äôre just antagonizing people on this sub and lodging insults for no reason. Do we need more mods? I may volunteer, dependent upon the time involved.      </p>
<p>EDIT: on second thought, let ‚Äòem troll. We can present our arguments in response to their inauthentic attempts at understanding. Thanks everyone! üòò</p></p>

        <p>I actually came to this sub because it was a place where people can vent. R/lockdownskepticism is great, but they have more stringent rules about venting. Now people from r/coronavirus are posting stuff here insinuating that I‚Äôm an imbecile (without ever discussing anything with me) and it‚Äôs very frustrating. I‚Äôm down for open dialogue, but some people just come here for some fun antagonization and I already feel beaten down.</p>

        <p>You really think so?  We've been in the madness for months now, it just gets worse even as hospitalizations and deaths tail off to minute numbers.  My county health board has renewed its mask mandate again, this time in perpetuity.   The governor of this state as extended it's royal decree of emergency into August.  My direct employer has mandated masking in common areas of a mostly empty campus, while the secondary employer has closed most entrances and those still open now have temperature checks for those few who enter.  Nobody has any clue when folks are gonna come back on site, those that are left at least since the company has RIF'd thousands so far.</p>
<p>The folks in my area still treat this like a deadly disease, wearing a mask when outside full time or pulling the mask up when they get within 30 feet of someone else.</p>
<p>I doubt there are any on the fence anymore.  Minds are settled and it looks to me like the large majority have chosen to live in fear for the rest of their days as well as attack anyone with a dissenting opinion.</p>

        <p>I live in a city where masks are mandated indefinitely, but I guess the emergency orders have to be renewed August 15 for them to continue. I don‚Äôt know many people in real life that feel the same way I do. I guess people‚Äôs minds have been made up as far as the lockdowns and masks, but I do think that every time the goal posts are moved or another right has been infringed upon, it makes people pause and review their views. I think the next possible thing would be mandatory vaccinations that make people stop and reconsider. Also, some people are more open to changing their mind than others. The media has been pushing the narrative that you‚Äôre a bad person who doesn‚Äôt care about others if you don‚Äôt wear a mask too. So I wonder if the type of person that doesn‚Äôt care as much what other people think of them would be more open to exploring whether masks are effective, etc.</p>

        <p>Presenting your arguments to the trolls just empowers them. It implicitly accepts their frame (that they can make whatever assertions they want while you have to justify everything) and it gives them the power to set the discussion agenda, change the subject, derail conversations, etc.</p>
<p>There are only two acceptable responses to trolls. The first one is to ban them, immediately, with no mercy. The second is to express detailed, graphic fantasies about killing them (in other words, troll back harder). Reasoning with them just falls into their trap</p>

<p>Debate is one thing. Sending death threats and insults is another. People keep harping that if we ban these people, it'll "make this an echo chamber". I just don't believe so. If anything, allowing these trolls to continue on sends the message that we allow harassment in these subs, and that it is encouraged by these bullies.</p>

        <p>Insane new sub: /r/nonewnormal</p>
<p>I posted this:</p>
<p>OK, I'll bite at your claims of rationality, which I HIGHLY doubt:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the arguments on this sub center around one principle: Freedom.</li>
<li>This assumes there is a "marketplace of ideas" in which we are "free" to  "believe anything we want" as a basic starting point without  restrictions. That is not an ethical stance, but an moral one. I  understand there is a perpetual tension between these two depending on  where you sit on that scale.</li>
<li>In principle, one can agree with this idea of freedom as a starting place,  but as a SOCIETY, we need to do things like make seat-belt regulations  since this is, on average, a better approach to the overall safety of  Most People. Literally what government is FOR, to make judgments and  laws based on morality which is an 'average best' based on FACTS.</li>
<li>Since  LIVES are at stake in this situation, it makes sense, for a time, for the moral aspect of society to temporarily override that of the individual and their moral stance; who is perhaps operating without a  full understanding of the facts- like if you were standing under a  falling tree, it's a moral stance that "well, you get to reap the harvest of your ignorance" but an ethical one to risk my own life or social  standing to move you out of the way forcibly, imagining that you PREFER  living to dying.</li>
<li>It seems to be the attitude of this sub and it's members to protest ANY  overriding ethics upon their moral approach, which is perhaps to be expected, given the VAST inequality that already exists in our society,  but that's a SEPARATE conversation, and one should rightly be protesting the VAST income inequality and so on SEPARATELY. I personally feel that most of the Freedumb stuff going on here in this sub is based on THAT  lingering feeling and not COVID in particular.</li>
<li>Now, individuals can be smart, but "people" are STUPID.</li>
<li>Not wearing a seat belt had to be MADE illegal to gradually overcome the stupidity of people operating out of the SAME kind of ignorance that creates most <a href="https://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/motorcycle-helmets-and-donor-organs/">organ donors from motorcycle accidents in states without helmet laws</a>.</li>
<li>Also, you guys DO NOT GET TO THINK WHATEVER YOU WANT. There is a MORAL imperative here: <a href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/Clifford_ethics.pdf">The Ethics Of Belief</a></li>
<li>I hope you guys do this: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-wise-therapist/202004/coronavirus-crisis-the-unexpected-gift-narcissists">https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-wise-therapist/202004/coronavirus-crisis-the-unexpected-gift-narcissists</a></li>
<li>The main issue at hand is that your "beliefs" conflict with Reality. This  sub is a basic inventory of logical fallacies, narcissistic assumptions,  psychopathy and most of all, ignorance. You guys are the literal  'poster adults' for Dunning-Krueger.</li>
<li>This ignorance appears to be fashioned out of this "No one is going to tell  ME ______" but that's basic narcissism and immaturity, <strong>not</strong> freedom.</li>
<li>This is why, over time, I've come to call this Freedumb instead of Freedom. This ignorance IS the problem.</li>
<li>Perhaps having such a large loud figure (Trump) displaying all these traits with so much hubris has emboldened you all to imagine that your voice should be heard in some way, and while I don't desire to exclude you,  you're WRONG, and worse the false equivalence and the raft of other  narcissistic logical fallacies that pervade this sub is a separate pandemic.</li>
<li>This sub is EXTREMELY privileged. Privilege is a stance that insists upon a  kind of politeness, even in emergencies. Like, I'm supposed to give you consent and have a discussion where you can "opt-in" based on "what you think" when you are OBVIOUSLY not in command of all the facts?</li>
<li>SHOULDN'T  a caring moral society use every means at its disposal to, say, move  someone out of the way of a falling free (what if I am seeing something  and you don't?) or an oncoming car or danger to your children or  grandparents fact-based data of how to keep people alive (i.e.  seatbelts, helmets, hardhats on job sites and other safety equipment?)</li>
<li>Social  Shaming; I GUARANTEE that this idea that one "shouldn't be shamed" (in this very thread similar complaints are being lodged) for "not wearing a  mask". Should a person standing under a falling tree be "shamed" if they continue standing in places where trees fall? I SERIOUSLY don't get the logic here. It's IMMORAL to NOT say something to people who  continue, say, their alcoholism by constantly going to bars, etc. You don't see that this INCREDIBLY selfish approach of the alcoholic in the bar is the same as that of the people on this sub?</li>
<li>People don't WANT people to die. What people WANT is stupid people who continue to do stupid things to STOP DOING STUPID THINGS. Willful ignorance= stupidity, and that's what all this is about.</li>
<li>I  fully expect to be banned from this sub as a result of this post, as I  would from any sub with an obvious agenda and an inflexible ideology like this one. Ironic, since this is a huge complaint by many on this sub at their treatment in other subs.</li>

        <p>By reading this sub and your post. </p>
<p>But it's telling that you think I'm specifically talking to YOU. Since that is clearly the only person you're concerned with. </p>
<p>Thus, my comments on narcissism and psychopathy. </p>
<p>Otherwise, why post on a sub taking up a stance against a reasonable social approach to a deadly disease with fear and suspicion? </p>
<p>I posted a link about that too. You have a chance to have a good look at the fact that you might be a narcissist or a psychopath and get help. </p>
<p>Or should we go into more evidence of Dunning-Krueger?</p>
<p>Look, I'm not like gloating about being right here, but your sub's insane ignorance and insistence on taking such a severely inappropriate response to a pandemic IS THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p><strong>Let's look at another logical take- does anyone on the sub possess a Driver's License? Tags for your car? Is ANY LEVEL of government moderation of common social verification to ensure safety a problem for you guys?</strong> </p>
<p>Reading your other posts about me, which confirm that diagnosis:</p>
<p>Yes, I guess it IS "trolling" and "insane bullshit" to have Empathy (psychopaths lack this, in case you weren't sure) and Concern For Others Over Yourself (another thing narcissists lack). </p>
<p>Normal humans (aka non-psychopaths and non-narcissists) actually have the GALL to imagine that such traits are noble and even high-minded. IMAGINE! Such people might even write up a Constitution and/or Charter Of Rights And Freedoms, which is the basis of your arguments here.</p>
<p>You guys aren't having ANY of THAT kinda "insane bullshit" (your words, not mine) around HERE. Oh NOOOOO. And hypocrisy is mentioned somehow un-ironically in a sub that is SO on the wrong side of this argument it's baffling anyone even makes it. </p>
<p>Honestly, doesn't the mocking <em>get</em> to any of you? Or do you imagine that it's all "just OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEM", what with my "insane" use of the caps lock key and all?</p>
<p>You can't see how you're wrong here? Honestly?</p>

        <p>A fallacy is a mistaken belief. Name calling is not a fallacy if one is correct. This debate is unproductive. You failed to identify what specifically you disagree with. I don‚Äôt really want to keep putting you down, but this is a waste of my time.<br>
Edit: and actually, name calling wouldn‚Äôt be a fallacy even if one was wrong. It would be a lie, not a fallacy. A statement is not a belief.</p>

        <p>Oh, YOU again. Hello. Heard any good fallacies lately?</p>
<p>I'd bet quite a lot of money that you simply cannot allow someone else to have to last word. We'll get to that in a minute.</p>
<p>And, just for reference, narcissist, here is the definition of this fallacy, not that facts or logic matter in a sub like this one. </p>
<p>But to be consistent and maintain my own sanity, I'm posting this:
https://my.ilstu.edu/~jecox/FOI%20Materials/Logical%20Fallacies%20Definitions%20and%20Examples.htm</p>
<p>A Google search will work. But I know you won't. Arguing the basic definitions of words? Either you're the smartest person on earth or... it's CLASSIC narcissism. It's in the previous post I made. </p>
<p>Ad Hominem: An attack, or an insult, on the person, rather than directly addressing the person's reasons. Name calling is a form of this fallacy.</p>
<p>I've TRIED to continue addressing your reasons, but there are so few of them that have actual reasoning and I addressed them all in the first post I made. I expected pretty much the responses I got, and every response you made simply confirmed my initial post's assessments, which are plainly obvious on the face of it, to anyone but people in this sub. </p>
<p>In ANY case, I'll be blocking you henceforth since I have better things to do with my life than argue with people to whom facts and logic is a bridge to a place they long to never be; and I'm DEFINITELY the troll of THAT particular bridge. </p>
<p>Too bad you'll never get to 'come back' at me with another useless argument in a vaguely defined sub full of powerless and ill-informed people. Buh Bye.</p>

        <p>1) I don't know how to do the science of epidemiology. The science is DONE. There is a consensus, already. Both among scientists and among those that rely upon them as reliable testimony; which is most rational people.</p>
<p>So, there are zero problems with the science unless you're taking up a stance against the science, not based in science ITSELF, but rather based on your own moral/ethical stance; since you cannot do it based on any science at all.</p>
<p>That is a fact that I'd like to see someone attempt to controvert with any kind of logic not based on self-rationalizations.  It doesn't seem likely to occur, based on what I've read on this sub.</p>
<p>So I don't need to make that argument since I'm not the one making an anti-science claim without using any science, being scientists, or using epidemiology research. You people are.</p>
<p>I notice that NO ONE here is making any specific scientific claims that Bad Science is somehow being done. I can GUARANTEE you there is not a SINGLE epidemiologist in anyone on this sub. NOT ONE.</p>
<p>And yet you all are making a LOT of claims and using a great many logical fallacies to do so, as evidenced by this post I'm replying to here.</p>
<p>So, I'm left with psychology, and this is something I DO understand and can make claims about and this is why I've taken this approach. I don't see anyone here doing similar things that are consistent with any kind of integrity at all, in fact.</p>
<p>Just a LOT of CLAIMS about a principle that you yourselves seem to be aspiring to, but utterly failing to grasp.</p>
<p>2) I DID give specifics about the REAL problem here, which is income inequality.  If you guys spent your time on the RIGHT things- i.e. moving against rich people and their cronies politicians to even the playing field, we'd not be having this conversation RIGHT NOW. But, instead of doing THAT, you lobby against progressive politicians in favor of the very people who put you in this fucked up situation to begin with. THIS is why ignorance is so terrible. You don't even know enough to form an accurate assessment of problems, never mind their solutions. And when someone offers you one, you don't even recognize it.</p>
<p>3) If you don't know how your ignorant approach to this disease is harming people, then you are a narcissist or a psychopath; which I've already covered. Prioritizing individual freedom at THIS time is about the dumbest thing imaginable, but since you are not only doing that but angry that someone would even question it, then I can't help you, and neither can anyone else. It's just an ethical stance I've taken that says that I must call you out on that, as ignorance has but one cure: Knowledge. If you're anti-knowledge, then you're a narcissist or a psychopath, in this situation.</p>

        <p>Fragile much? I've already covered why I don't need to cite science here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Not a scientist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is complete consensus on the science</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE ENTIRE WORLD HAS BEEN TELLING YOU about the science. FOR MONTHS. EVERY SINGLE MEDIA OUTLET. And yet SOMEHOW you are still posting like a moron on a sub for people who STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND. Are you SERIOUS?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caps Lock= ShOUTING? Fragile much? Get over yourself. If you HONESTLY can't handle CAPS LOCK and you think that it's SHOUTING and you are OFFENDED by this, I CANNOT IMAGINE what it's like to hear good science being given to you for MONTHS and you cannot hear that either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This might be the single dumbest thing I've ever heard anyone say, but this entire sub is FILLED with this kind of stupidity, so I didn't expect much better.</p>

        <p>I see from your post history that you have autism. I really hope you can get some professional help. I don‚Äôt think we can continue to have this discussion, because generally referring to ‚Äúthe science‚Äù and berating me does not allow for a meaningful dialogue. Take care of yourself.</p>

        <p>Oh nice. The hallmark of a narcissist is scapegoating!</p>
<p>I got Narcissist Bingo! Thanks for confirming my hypothesis so appropriately. </p>
<p>You can get that easily in just a couple of posts on THIS sub. </p>
<p>Psychopath Bingo too, if you enjoy both.</p>
<p>And it seems like BOTH of your type, in the form of anti-vaxxers, would rather KILL THEIR OWN KIDS than let them have what I have. So, in that sense I got psychopath bingo too! </p>
<p>Yay me!</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm vaccinated and I don‚Äôt have kids. Please calm down. I would suggest meditation, self reflection, and some time in the great outdoors. It can help with your anxiety.</p>
