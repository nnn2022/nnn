    <strong>Question about AstraZeneca</strong>
    <p><p>What I am wondering is why, when I took my grandmother for her first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, they asked me if she was on Warfarin? </p>
<p>For those who don’t know, Warfarin is an anti-coagulant medication; that thins the blood. My grandmother used to be on Warfarin but, about a year prior, had been changed over to an alternative medication.  They said this is fine and went ahead with the inoculation. </p>
<p>Bearing in mind this was in January. Before the blood clotting from the AstraZeneca jab really started to come to light.</p>
<p>My question is, what is the intrinsic link between the vaccine and coagulation of the blood that they were already aware of in January?</p></p>

        <p>If we’re being honest, they might not know. What they do/did know is that they had seen adverse side effects on people who were taking warfarin, and so they added it to the checks, to try to avoid those side effects</p>

        <p>Right, that much is obvious. But did no one consider that whatever bodily functions the vaccine affects is interfering with the same functions that warfarin affects? 
Like, for example, coagulation of the blood? That would increase ones risk of thrombosis? </p>
<p>Then people who aren’t even on blood thinners get complications. </p>
<p>Surely you see my point?</p>

        <p>UK has recommended those under 30 not take AstraZeneca.</p>
<p>Australia under 50.</p>
<p>Canada under 55.</p>
