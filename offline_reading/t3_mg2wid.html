    <strong>Effectiveness of Common Masks Against Covid-19 Size Particulate - Tested with the CDC's Own Test Standard</strong>
    <p><p>* Sick of hearing of reports that claim that common masks are effective against Covid-19 but not seeing any actual data to support that? This is the post for you. This post is not meant to be a Pro-mask or Anti-mask post. It is meant to be used to inform people of the facts and show actual data related to how masks are evaluated so that they may be informed. This post will contain test methodology, data, pictures, and a Q&amp;A at the end. All references are public information and the masks tested in the pictures are my own personal masks. Nothing is confidential. Please spread the word on this and let me know if there are other/better forums where this info can go and I apologize if this isn't the correct forum to post on.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: The common cloth masks and surgical masks that people wear (and in some cases forced to wear) provide NO protection to the user against Covid-19 nor protection to others if the user is knowingly/unknowingly infected. This has been known as early as 2010 directly from a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314261/">study</a> by the CDC. Tests conducted per the CDC test standard since April 2020 at the Chemical Biological Center: Aberdeen Proving Ground also come to this conclusion. Start demanding answers from your Local and State representatives as to why people are being forced to wear products that do not sufficiently protect against Covid-19 or why people were not honestly told about the safety risks of wearing these masks. If you contracted the virus after wearing these masks and still have serious health conditions, there may be pathways to litigation due to product liability.</p>
<p><strong>Post:</strong> The Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) evaluates N95 respirators based on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/stps/pdfs/TEB-APR-STP-0059-508.pdf">Procedure No TEB-APR-STP-0059</a>. In short, a mask is sealed to a test plate, placed in a box, and is then inserted into a machine called the TSI 8130. This machine then generates an aerosol particulate challenge and the aerosol is pulled through the affixed mask. The number of particles are counted before the mask and then afterwards to obtain a percent penetration of these particles through the mask. In the case of the N95, the passing criteria must be less than 5% penetration (or 95% effectiveness which is where the name comes from). A value of 5% or less has been deemed "acceptable" protection against virus particulate threats by the CDC. An easier way to think of this is that if 100 particles were in the air, 5 particles or less should be able to pass through the mask.</p>
<p>The aerosol challenge simulant is a 2% salt solution with the particle size distribution looking like this.</p>

<p>The following picture shows an N95 that was tested to the CDC NIOSH test standard. The mask is sealed to the plate with a glue or equivalent substance (black Butyl caulking in photo) to ensure that 100% of the airflow passes through the mask. You'll see a few numbers in the green box:</p>

<p>As can be seen, these masks provide little to no protection for the wearer against these virus sized and other accompanying particles. This also applies if you are wearing the mask and don't know that you're contagious since you will still be breathing out a large amount of the particles that you're trying to protect others from. Furthermore, these values would only apply if you were gluing the mask to your face to ensure that 100% of the airflow went through the mask. Airflow, like water or electricity, wants to flow through the path of least resistance and although you might not be able to perceive it, you will still be breathing around these masks instead of through the actual filtration media.</p>
<p>The following shows an elastomeric half mask being tested that is readily available for purchase and is some of the best protection that you can buy for yourself and your family offering better protection than the N95 or wearing multiple masks at the same time.</p>

<p>According to CDC guidance, you are <strong>NOT ALLOWED</strong> to protect yourself with this mask because it has an outlet valve and thus wouldn't protect others if you are unknowingly infected. The latest <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2021/Feb/04/2002576265/-1/-1/1/DOD-ANNOUNCES-USE-OF-MASKS-AND-OTHER-PUBLIC-HEALTH-MEASURES.PDF">DoD mask mandate</a> also specifies that you cannot wear this mask despite being demonstrably more effective than cloth masks. <strong>How do these decisions help people protect themselves from Covid-19</strong>?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>What should you do:</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully this post has been informative for all. If you are a pro-mask person, this information should help you justify obtaining an N95 or equivalent mask to protect yourself and your family. If you are an anti-mask person, this post only confirms that you had just as much of a chance at being infected as those that actually wore a mask so what was the point of it all anyway. Either way, answers should be demanded as to why this information was not distributed tot he public so that in case another pandemic occurs, people can be adequately prepared. If you wore these masks, were infected, and now have lasting health conditions, I would consider seeking litigation for product liability against those who recommended (or mandated) these products because they do not function properly as you're being told and this is provable by the information shared above.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Common Questions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Even if a mask has a penetration of 80%, that still means that it's at least 20% effective and I'm preventing the spread of Covid by 20% right?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: This is a common misinterpretation of these results. Again, if there were 100 Covid particles in the air, you would still breathe in up to 80 particles. Likewise if you expelled 100 particles, 80 particles would still get through the mask and into the open. Since a virus is biological in nature, it only takes a few particles/spores to infect. A person who inhaled 20 spores would most likely take longer to show symptoms than a person who inhaled 80 spores, but the spread of the virus would still occur regardless.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> We see in some States that cases of infections are dropping and since there are mask mandates in these locations, the reduction in cases must be due to people wearing masks right?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This is a common justification for individuals to wear masks indefinitely, but the argument is based on confirmation bias and the assumption that these masks worked in the first place despite data to the contrary. If you already think that masks prevent people from getting Covid and preventing the spread to other, when you see a trend in data that shows a decline in cases, you assume that it's because masks (or other safety protocols such as the 6ft rule) are effective. The data shown above clearly show that these masks cannot protect or prevent the spread of Covid so it cannot be considered a large factor in the decline of cases over time. Similarly if you looked at the cases between a State like California (large mask mandates) versus a State like Florida (very loose mandates), the trend in case data is statistically identical per capita because masks had no impact on the spread or prevention. If you've worn a mask since the start of the pandemic and haven't gotten infected, it does not mean that masks work, it only means that you haven't been exposed while wearing the mask.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The media and other organizations have stated that cloth and other masks are effective at protecting people from Covid and preventing the spread. Additionally, multiple Universities have conducted studies that show masks are effective at protection and preventing the spread. Are these studies not correct?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Have these studies been conducted to a nationally recognized test standard set forth directly by the CDC? How have the tests been conducted? Were there adequate quality controls in the testing procedure? Unfortunately, data collected without a test standard can be misinterpreted or in some cases misleading. The CDC was already of the performance of these masks as early as 2010 as seen from this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314261/">study</a>. Do any of these studies actually post the results on public forums for people to see? It would be interesting to see if these same masks that supposedly pass these tests would pass the CDC test standard.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Even though these masks do not fully protect the user and others from the virus, they still must have helped a little since the beginning of the pandemic correct?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> On the contrary, the misinformation on masks may have caused unnecessary exposures and potential deaths, especially for people who were already in poor health. The data and pictures above show that these masks are ineffective at protecting against the virus. If you weren't honestly told about or hadn't seen this information, you would go out thinking that you're protected when you're really not and thus may have contract the virus. Likewise, you were told that wearing a mask protects others from you if you had the virus. If someone goes out who has the virus (knowingly or unknowingly) but puts on a mask thinking that they are still protecting others, they are STILL spreading the virus because it can still escape from the mask thus infecting others. As pessimistic as it sounds, the number of infections and deaths that have been prevented from people wearing these common masks has been zero.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Wearing the mask may not capture the virus particles, but it at least reduces how far the virus travels away from me (less than 6ft) if I'm infected so I'm preventing the spread right?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It is true that wearing a mask will ensure that anything exiting in your breath travels less, but it is still not capturing the particles that would infect others. Particles do not travel a certain distance and then magically drop to the ground never to go airborne again. They are constantly stirred up by wind, airflow systems in buildings, or the natural airflow turbulence that people create just by walking around to which they then have the potential to infect others.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It has been said that the virus travels on larger sized droplets and the test referenced above doesn't capture that data. Common face masks can capture these larger particles correct which is why they're being recommended for use correct?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If this claim is to be believed, a few things need to be addressed. What tests and data are available to show that the virus does indeed travel on these larger particles (i.e. water droplets). Were these tests done to a nationally recognized test standard? Mask mandates were set in place around the April-May timeframe of 2020. If they worked at preventing infection or spread of infection, why did cases still rise throughout the year? Furthermore, if this is the main mechanism of how viruses travel, the nationally recognized CDC test Standard is incorrect and would potentially invalidate hundreds of approved face masks and respirators. The simplest explanation is usually the correct explanation.</p></p>

        <p>It’ll do no good. I agree this a great post but the problem here is that you’re essentially trying to talk to programmed cult members. No matter what you say, no matter what you show them, they won’t believe. A year in to this BS, It’s too late. They’re too far gone. The initial reaction to this post will be, “Pffft, who is this guy?” Great job though OP, well done.</p>
