    <strong>Worst Case Ontario</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, I am writing to the community today because I am sick. Sick of the way I have been feeling as of late. This lockdown has been hitting me and my girlfriend really hard this time around. Many of my joys and little hobbies I like doing are now “non-essential”. I can’t buy new cloths, can’t find the proper bolt sizing for a few projects I have been working on (I usually go into the store and test out a few nut sizes), can’t get the right paint shades from guessing online, can’t even say my own opinion when someone asks me for it. My credit is in the shitter so I am against ordering stuff online because I have a bad habit of never getting back around to paying it off. Some of my favourite local diners now have the doors shut, never to be opened again.  Now this propaganda and opinion pushing by family and social platforms is getting to an all time high. I have a thick skin and a strong head, but when In the hell did we take the right of opinion away in Canada? My girlfriend went to a peaceful protest down by the river and there was an anti-protest? She had a sign that said “My Body My Choice” and people took pictures of her and posted it. Called her horrible names, it took me a long time to get the thread taken down. I guess what I’m trying to get at is why do people feel the need to bully “us” into submission when I don’t identify as an activist or some crazy murderer, just a person who would prefer not get involved? Why do people bring up this topic, then get defencive and hate me for stating my viewpoint when I never wanted to in the first place? Where has unity gone and the divide started in this province? Is it like this all across Canada or is this just the WORST CASE ONTARIO.......</p>
<p>Thank you for taking your time to read this, I could go on and on about policing and unfair fines being thrown out left and right. I could talk about Doug Ford and the way his net worth skyrocketed during the Pandemic. I could mention how they are keeping COVID patients in the motels of my less than valuable neighbourhood and calling it a “hotspot”. However, I didn’t want to write a book today.</p>
<p>Your neighbourhood friend,
CanadianCanuk </p>

<p>Just go get me some sweet and power chicken and fuck off!</p>
<p>Seriously though, I feel ya.</p>
<p>I'm in Nova Scotia and we are locked down over nothing. In fact people here have been enjoying "normal life" for a while... (As if having a 10 Erwin limit to who can be in your OWN FUCKING HOUSE is normal)</p>
<p>But everyone blames people from Ontario for our third wave. The media and local politicians are litterally pushing the narritive that one family from Ontario had a BBQ here and that's responsible for the lockdown...</p>

        <p>The U.S. Walmart's and other major stores announced "no mask mandates". I'm from the West side of Chicago, it's ending here and we had about 3 months of "strict lockdowns".  Hopefully, the U.S. influence will extend influence up North. The Toronto Blue Jays play in New York, my god!</p>
