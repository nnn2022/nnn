    <strong>The majority of people are stupid but you're telling me that the small minority of people that aren't complying are the idiots?</strong>
    <p><p>I use the term "small minority" loosely, of course, as we have 82k members and rising and contrary to what the media would have you believe there are millions attending anti-lockdown protests all over the world. Of course, we're still dwarfed by the sheer number of NPCs and doomers furiously boot-licking and goose-stepping our way towards medical tyranny and authoritarian police states. I can only speak from my own experience, and of course I'm going to be a bit biased here, but many of the posts and comments from members here (and other subreddits like ChurchOfCovid) show a level of lucidity and intellectual curiosity far above the braying masses getting their jabs and wearing their face-diapers. At least we're fucking asking questions.</p>
<p>You lapped that bat-soup wet-market bullshit up for over a year and you believe everything mainstream media tells you. You know that old saying Mom likes to throw out: "if all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too?" Yeah, maybe she had a fucking point. Maybe rushing out to get a medical treatment that's being marketed and pushed like a fancy new trend isn't a good idea. I'm shocked they didn't come out with another social media craze like the "ALS Ice bucket challenge" where instead of chucking ice over yourself for virtue-signalling points you film yourself getting vaxxed; probably because more than enough people would pass out or go into seizures immediately after the shot that it would expose the whole fucking thing for the dangerous sham it is.</p>
<p>Instead just post your vax card on Facebook, write a shitty regurgitated joke about "Microsoft" and "5G", soak in the glow of the like you gained from your wine-drunk, Minion-loving Aunt, and take a fucking rest as the migraine pulsates its way towards a full-blown aneurysm. Congratufuckinglations you're just like every other sap on the planet. Independance should be valued, not mocked and sneered at. For over a year you've preached that patience is a virtue, to stay inside and wait it out: yet the moment this fucking experimental jab is hastily shat out like liquid, lava dookie after a nasty, drunken curry from the night before you rush out to get it and demand everyone else do the same.</p></p>

        <p>Ever see that movie Idiocracy, that's America in real time but worse. </p>
<p>I know a lot of the dummies don't read even with full internet connections, but how can you miss the endless reports of vaxx side effects? How can you miss all the crap that doesn't add up? How can you miss the dubious origins of Covid to begin with?</p>
<p>Believe the sCiEnCe!</p>
<p>They barely even know what that is.</p>
<p>Stupidity is destroying America. Maybe I am a cynical non-trusting type, but at least I am not dumb enough to trust the sociopaths who destroyed our lives in one and half years. The edges are fraying too, on the supply chains and more.</p>

        <p>In regards to the vax side effects, I saw a post on covidvaccinated where this girl had really really bad symptoms and said the vax ruined her life or something. Further down she goes, “oh well if it were actually dangerous it would be all over the news! The media wouldn’t hide this” or something like that. </p>
<p>People are ridiculously ignorant of the mass web of control the pharmaceutical companies have over the government and media.</p>

        <p>For the last year, the majority of the masses have been suffering from mental illness which mimics schizophrenia. Just go to a store and a take a look. When you see an employee spraying lysol all over a grocery cart where your food is about to be placed, you know they are completely fucked in the head.</p>

        <p>That just seems to me that the emotions of these people of being scared has been intensified through the media/social media. I’ve seen so so many fake accounts on social media pretending to be old people as well, but you can tell from the way they speak they’re a young doomer, trying to fuel the fear, there’ll be so many people who don’t want life to return to normal so they will do anything possible for it to stay this way because their introverted life has been way better since the pandemic. And usually they’re the craziest who’ll shout the loudest and cry the hardest to get what they want.</p>

        <p>It is honestly not about being introverted. The reality here is, the average IQ today is approximately 25 points lower than it was 40 years ago. The majority of the masses are mentally inept today. It is very easy to brainwash and scare the fuck out of them. When people have an 85 IQ, they can't think for themselves, so the TV does it for them. The stupidity of the sheep will cause the permanent erosion of all rights and freedoms.</p>

        <p>As I have said before, what is the difference between the face diaper wearing sheep and a rock ? Nothing, since neither is able to think. In a couple months, when you go to the grocery store, and the so-called security there try and deny you the ability to buy food, just remember who is responsible for neverending tyranny. The idiotic sheep who continue to obey are the main issue at the moment. If everyone stopped obeying this bullshit, the scamdemic would end. The only thing holding this horseshit together is the fear emanating from the brainwashed masses.</p>

<p>82k is a drop in the bucket in a planet of 8 billion+. Not to mention that even the protests could be much bigger than they actually are. There's simply not enough people protesting and fighting this.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, the majority of people are stupid. That's the problem. The elites know this.</p>
