    <strong>This Might Be My Angriest Post Yet</strong>
    <p><p>The First Minister of Wales, Mark "Fuck Me Harder Daddy" Drakeford has come out and said that "life will not be returning to normal by the end of 2021" and that restrictions such as social distancing will continue, despite cases and deaths dropping rapidly and the majority of "at risk" people having had the vaccine pumped into their arms. As you can imagine, I am beyond fucking furious. Fucking LIVID, in fact. Fucking steam is rising up off my keyboard as I type, I'm that fucking angry.</p>
<p>My wife and I planned to have our proper wedding later this year, having had our legal ceremony in January, but I guess that's been fucked AGAIN! Thanks, dickhead, really fucking appreciate it! Guess the woman I love is never going to get her special fucking day. My Grandparents might never get the chance to be at my wedding because they'll have died of fucking old age by the time this shit is over. I feel like screaming in the cunt's face until my lungs collapse. He wants to prevent another surge, apparently. Guess that means the vaccines do FUCK ALL then! Cheers for making that crystal clear, cunt.</p>
<p>This is the same evil bastard that cancelled fucking Christmas about a week before at extremely short notice. Fucking GRINCH. How this fucking soiled face-mask of a human being manages to cling onto his fucking job is beyond me. He's also managed to get "curfew for men" trending on fucking Twitter, too. Yeah, some retard floated that idea because a woman got killed in England and rather than simply   outright dismiss it for the half-baked nonsense that it is or just, I don't know, fucking ignore it he had to go and fucking start a conversation around it. Fucking genius.</p>
<p>I can't fucking deal with this clown-world much longer. Everything is a fucking issue. Everything needs to be discussed. Everything is a fucking debate. Every delusional, phone-obsessed, Forrest Gump fuck-head needs to have their voice heard. Oh, fucking, here's Joey fucking Essex, he has a neat little "thought" floating around his vacuous fucking head, let's hear him fucking out shall we: "yEaH, sO liKe, aLl dEm pEoPlE dYiNg fRoM tHe rOnA, yEaH? cAn wE nOT jUsT, i dUnNo, pUt 'eM oN a BaRgE oR sUmMin aNd fLoAt 'eM oUt tA sEa oR puT 'eM oN LoVe IsLaNd?", oo, fucking interesting, salient thought there, Joey. LET'S DISCUSS IT.</p>
<p>FUCKING RETARDED.</p></p>

        <p>I've seen car maskers and wanderers in the street but not many. At home sounds insane! Maybe if someone you live with currently has COVID and you're worried for yourself that makes sense but not under any other circumstance, even then most families would surely accept that they too will catch it and keep interacting with eachother</p>
