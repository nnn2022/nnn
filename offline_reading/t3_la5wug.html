        <p>Well I have the video saved of Fauci telling us that droplet size was too small and the populace didn’t need a mask. I had surgeon general Powell implore us that we didn’t need masks.  It was on the news to not wear. I don’t care that they didn’t want panic buying. Tell me from day 1 to make my own. Masks do work in Asian countries wear they wear them right and in unity. But here they just don’t work. My beard is massive. I can put on a mask and it only touches the top of my nose. The rest is pushed away from my face. If a mask were to work . Everyone would need n95 and properly secure them. You see those covid nurses with them massive skin marks from mask tightness? Unless you look like that after 30 minutes.. your masking isn’t on right. Also airborne viruses go thru the eyes. Who is wearing goggles? And you can’t just say don’t touch my eyes.. the droplets you can inhale can just as easily fly right into your eyes. Then bacteria. Anyone and we know most do.. wearing the same mask without washing it daily is subject to bacterial pneumonia. I’m not saying fauci said that caused the 1918 outbreak to be worse.. he didn’t blame masks. But.. a cloth unwashed mask can cause bacterial pneumonia.</p>

        <p>Ok, so it seems that the reason you don't wear masks are A. Because the government told you not to at the beginning of the pandemic. B. Because it is uncomfortable/doesn't fit. C. Because of bacteria in cloth masks and D. Because we can't wear them in unity.</p>
<p>So for point A, I agree that the government fucked up. It's completely idiotic for them to go out and say "don't wear masks", even though it was unsure what the extent of the virus' spread was. I still don't see this as a reason not to wear a mask NOW, as it is clearly stated that it helps. </p>
<p>For B, I understand it's uncomfortable. But those pictures you mention of doctors with marks are because they have been in intense surgery, sweating and being nervous, while having to wear that mask for multiple hours. I have been in a mask for 5 hours straight, and while I did have a small mark (that went away after 15 minutes) it was nothing too horrible. It sounds like you're exaggarating here.</p>
<p>For C. this point only stands if someone's an idiot. It is really obvious that cloth masks need to be washed. If someone doesn't understand that then they clearly don't care about this at all or are stupid. </p>
<p>For D, I might have to say something that might sound a bit offensive but I don't mean to be rude here. Isn't this because of anti-maskers like the people in this subreddit? You're the ones who don't want to wear masks, meaning you're the ones who are making it so we can't be in unity about wearing masks.</p>
<p>Again, I don't mean to be rude here so excuse me if i come off as such.</p>

        <p>Not at all. Here’s the thing. I don’t speak for everyone here. I’m here to discuss. If a business tells me to put on a mask I comply. I’m not going viral on tik tok or arguing with someone just doing their job. So I do wear the mask when a business says I have to. That said I don’t fit the average person. Covid cost me a mid 6 figure job and now because of being smart I’m taking a couple years or more off. That said.. others can sit in their home and just Amazon and door dash almost all items. Every time I have went out.. maybe 70% wear masks. The main thing here is masks/guns. Same argument I think. You ban one magazine. You lose something else next. So we have to wear masks now right? What next? Vaccine papers to fly? To work? Fuck that. People see how crazy it’s making others. An American citizen got arrested last week for a meme he made in 2016. They waited 5 years to arrest a guy for a meme. That’s not America. So we see crazy shit happen. Riots for 7 months. Arrests at capitol. It sets the stage for very invasive mask laws or mandatory vaccine. Now I’m pro vax but not pro this vax. I’ll wait a decade and see how many it kills.</p>

        <p>So from my understanding, you think the enforcing of masks will lead to laws and regulations spiralling out of control? You seem like a reasonable guy, could you explain why you don't trust the covid vaccine?</p>

        <p>Ok so to be clear. All my kids got all their vax shot except gardacil. I didn’t trust that one and neither did my physician for my kids. Now they are all adults. But it’s important to me that this gets proven safe. Trump rushed it. Pfizer rushed it. Moderna rushed it. I do not yet feel I trust it. This virus has already mutated. Also you seem smart also so I have this question? Why would you want others to take it? This shot only lessens YOUR level of sickness if you get sick. It doesn’t stop you from spreading it or getting it. It’s not like the polio vax. Moderna said this openly. To me that’s not enough to risk it. If they make one that cures it or blocks it.. we will see. Even Mayo Clinic agrees It doesn’t stop spread.</p>

        <p>Comparing state to state and country to country, there is no correlation between lockdown stringency or mask mandates and impact on pcr positives, hospitalizations, or moratilty.  The greatest predictor of resource utilization is season, and the greatest predictor of outcome, either for an individual or a population, is health.</p>
<p>Given zero evidence for widespread mask and lockdown efficacy and limitless evidence for the negative impacts, they should clearly all be abandoned immediately.  If it is found valuable to OFFER protection to some vulnerable populations that DECIDE, ON THEIR OWN that they want additional restrictions, these should be available.  In no case should be people kidnapped, imprisoned, forcibly medicated, or coerced in to any of these.  We used to have laws and even foundational government documents that made such actions illegal and even unthinkable, but they have been deemed inconvenient by the current administrations.</p>

        <p>Because there is no science study which indicates that masks are effective to avoid any virus. Because masks reduce oxygen intake. Because masks increase the risk of developing bacterial pneumonia. </p>
<p>Because masks are enforced to create mass panic, paranoia and hysteria. Because if it wasn't because all the sheep are wearing masks, no one would even notice that there was a "new virus". Which in fact, there isn't, it's just the flu.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but on the other hand, according to UNICEF, there's ~22,000 children dying every single day as a result of extreme poverty. That's 7.8 million a year, so... If we're talking about saving human lives, it seems to me that it would be more logical to open everything and increase productivity than shutting down everything deemed unessential... I mean, c'mon. How does that even compute in the terms of mortality and it's causes?...</p>

        <p>Ok, sure, we're on. I live in Italy where wearing mask is enforced for almost a year now, there are travel restrictions, non essential businesses are closed and there's even a curfew. It still suck, they still say it's a crisis and the only effects I can see is people going bankrupt. Any thoughts?</p>

        <p>I don't know how the situation is in Italy, but as I live in Norway I will try to explain my view. In Norway, we had about a 4-6 week quarantine period in march/april. Schools were closed, many workplaces were closed, and we were encouraged to wear a mask, which many did. </p>
<p>Then, when summer arrived, we were able to open everything up from most of june-august. Then a new wave hit, and we had to make some more restrictions. Then, we opened up everything from late September till November, and now in December/january we have had many more cases and forced into lockdown again, which has now been lifted. </p>
<p>Every time we had these quarantine periods and restriction, corona virus cases dropped. When we opened again, cases increased. In my experience these quarantines, lockdowns and restrictions have helped massively.</p>
<p>In the US, however, from my impression I see that many do not wear masks, lockdowns are fairly inconsistent and the covid response from Trump was terrible. To me, this shows that good government response with lockdowns/quarantines/restrictions help, and bad responses like Trump's don't.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I think the core of the issue is that many people, including you apparently, think that delaying my the inevitable is somehow worth the price we have to pay for it. Here's the thing, the way I see it: crippling the economy is only worth doing if it can get rid of the virus. Now the question is, can you even do that?... And here's a hint: majority of virologists say the virus is here to stay.</p>

        <p>If you see how New Zealand have been doing, they do extreme lockdowns whenever new cases come, and also help its citizens financially. Just because the US government has been a complete shitshow doesn't mean there's a need for anti-maskers to harm others unnecessarily on top of that.</p>

        <p>Yeah, sure. But what they did was putting themselves in total isolation, not to mention that new Zealand is one of those places where people naturally don't get clumped into small areas. It's only 18 people per square kilometer there. In most of the world it simply isn't sustainable</p>

        <p>There are areas in NZ with similar population density to other countries like the US. Those still benefitted from these restriction. If the US had a functioning government at the time Covid started, we wouldn’t have these numbers.</p>

        <p>There are benefits in areas with low population density where the virus isn't a huge issue in the first place because the healthcare system can cope with it. But where it really is an issue, like in large cities, the cost is just so high that it's really hard to justify it in my view</p>

        <p>I believe wearing a mask is necessary because of the proven effects it has at counteracting Covid. I also believe that anyone saying "Why don't you this during the flu?" or "Corona isn't dangerous" are being intentionally ignorant. </p>
<p>In the 2019 USA flu season, where there were none to very few lockdowns/restrictions, 24 thousand people died. In 2020-2021, during heavy lockdowns, restrictions, quarantines and travel bans, 441 thousand people have died. This is a little under 19 times as many, in completely different circumstances. Does this not convince you how much worse this virus is compared to the flu?</p>
<p>Here are some studies:</p>

        <p>First, Thank You for approaching in good faith!</p>
<p>I'm anti-lockdown for a lot of the reasons mentioned by the people in the sub. Many believe the virus is real but the response is so out of proportion to the actual dangers the virus represents. The emotional shaming that is incurred when we talk about this subject just emphasizes that a large amount of people are letting fear impact their decision making. Lockdowns have large economical and mental health effects that are not given much attention, we are trying to put more of that attention in the public view. </p>
<p>Also during this crisis, you see more of our personal freedoms and rights being taken away under the guise of public health.</p>

        <p>~55 million people die every year worldwide, that puts covid deaths at around 4% of total deaths using quick math yet the focus of our society is heavily on covid since it is a new threat. Time and resources would be better spent  encouraging active lifestyles, healthy diets, and overall boosting immune systems. </p>
<p>Instead we get heavy handed lockdowns with a daily dose of fear. Also, your feelings and mine as well have nothing to do with the situation. Feelings is not logic</p>

<p>You try to assume the moral high ground, but it doesn't work because 1, we don't purposely seek to spread any virus, and 2, we show concern for others and their wellbeing when we discuss the social, economic, mental, and emotional impacts of lockdowns/mandates and how it is imperative to lift all restrictions to deter any further damage.</p>
<p>&rt;it stops being your body, your choice, as you have now purposefully given others a virus that can kill them or harm them for life.</p>
<p>Again, not on purpose. Humans are not malevolent disease vectors trying to kill others biologically and should not be treated as such. We are people with complex motivations, values, and opinions. To impose restrictions on another person's body to make yourself feel better is not the other person's problem, it's yours.</p>
