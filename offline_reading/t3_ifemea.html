    <strong>Had a confrontation over masks in my building</strong>
    <p><p>Preamble: In my city, masks have been mandatory in common areas of apartment buildings for about three weeks. Compliance in my building is about 70-80% among residents, and about 10-20% among the concierge/security people (funny, eh?). Hardly anybody wears a mask in the laundry room. I'll wear one in the elevator if the people riding with me are so as not to stir shit up, but that's about it.</p>
<p>On to the story. Today, I was waiting for the elevators. A dude - millennial, about my age - comes into the waiting area and tells me, "You need to start wearing a mask. I've seen you around and you're never wearing one." He's a resident, not staff. I start arguing with him; he's technically in the right, so there's not much I can do except be snarky and condescending ("whatever, dude"). At one point I ask him if he's ever looked into the evidence surrounding masks, and he rolls his eyes and scoffs, as if I'm "one of those people." The confrontation ends with him telling me I have a "piss-poor attitude."</p>
<p>In the meantime, others in the lobby make their contributions. One says, "You really should follow the rules." After I get in the elevator, the guy I'm riding with (not the one who confronted me originally) points to the button I pressed and says, "Our neighbors live on that floor," obviously implying that I'm being inconsiderate for not thinking of their "safety." I say, "Yeah, what's your point?" He just shrugs, obviously too afraid to continue the conflict. He gets off before me, and I wish him a good day.</p>
<p>There's no point to this story, really, except to vent. I've always been one of those "people are stupid" types, but I usually like individual people when I meet them, and am always warm and friendly with strangers. Today was a unique occurrence, but if this "pandemic" keeps up, it won't stay unique. I'll become ruder and more combative every day. I'm already starting to hate most people. I hate my doomer co-workers. I hate the guy in the lobby. I hate the woman at the grocery store meat counter today who recoiled in fear when I pulled down my bandana to repeat my order when she couldn't hear me the first time (never mind that I only wear it when interacting with employees, for their benefit). This "pandemic" is bringing about the worst in me. It's ruining my mental health and making me hate everything.</p>
<p>God help me. God help us.</p></p>

        <p>He's not "technically in the right", mask wearing is theater.  It takes a certain kind of strength to know what you're doing is right despite the pressure from everyone else.</p>

        <p>True, I suppose a better word would be "legally," since it's a city bylaw. But yeah, it's amazing how much weight people give to what authorities and their peers say when determining their moral compass. It's childish, in a way.</p>

        <p>Laws are legislated. Mask mandates are ordered but are not laws, thus cannot legally be enforced. TPTB have taken a huge gamble doing this and could easily be their downfall if the public had this knowledge. It is important to stress language and how things are phrased when it comes to laws and the courts.</p>

        <p>Here in Canada, the masks rules are in fact city bylaws, not mandates. On the bright side, they all have expiration dates. Whether the bylaws will simply be renewed when they expire is another question.</p>

<p>That being said I’ve decided in this particular situation I’d rather avoid confrontation than disobey because it’s something that does not affect me in a negative way. In the future for something more serious let’s say a mandatory vaccine, I would not comply to avoid confrontation.</p>

<p>Yes mask madates indoor public spaces where i live . I go in maskless and have only been told to leave once. You dont need to pull a fit. Just go in deal with the pressure and leave. If they tell you to leave you can also tell them you have a medical condition and if they still tell you to leave never shop there again.</p>

        <p>It seems that what i told you hit a nerve. Your brother doesnt wear it and theres countless posts on this sub of people who dont wear masks in places that they are mandatory and massively upvoted.</p>
<p>I understand its easier to just wear a mask but you need to realize that when someone doesnt wear his mask it can encourage others to do the same even though they might be scared to not do it.</p>
<p>And to me  and many on this sub, the mask is much more than justa piece of cloth like your saying. Its a symbol of submission to their tyranny and of whats to come.</p>

        <p>Amen to this! I feel it is my patriotic duty to set and be  a mask- less example (despite the mandatory mask order) for others. My hope is that when the unhappily masked compliers see me happily shopping sans mask (as they uncomfortably shift / touch / fiddle with theirs) that somewhere it registers for them that compliance is not ACTUALLY required. Or perhaps such a realIzation will occur after an accumulation of such observations.  Others NEED to be shown that, in the vast majority of cases, there are zero consequences to continuing life as normal.  I select my groceries, order from the fish monger, and check out with my items the same as eveeeeryone else.</p>

        <p>I agree. Of course we should defy unjust rules whenever possible, but we all have different wants and needs to consider. My husband and I enter stores unmasked, few people have said anything, but when they do, we wear bandanas over our faces for maybe 30 seconds until whoever said something is no longer watching. Why? We'd rather avoid legal trouble because we care more about moving out to the countryside and dropping out of society than making a show of what big rebels we are in solidarity with other unmasked hooligans.This was our plan before COVID, only know is it more urgent.</p>
<p>I cringe when someone overuses the term "sheep" in a sociopolitical context for the same reason I cringe at the words "soyboy", "beta", "cuck", "simp", "libtard", "conservatard", "pig", "wolf", and "sheepdog" in similar context: they're the words bots, trolls, and paid shills use to deflect actual analysis of the complex cultural and psychological factors at play. Knowing and understanding is half the battle, calling our opponents "sheep" detracts from understanding their very human motives and actions.</p>

        <p>I had a big black dude confront me and my family at the store (I'm black too, but cut and in shape 155) he was probably 30 pounds smaller than you, but he backed down when I stood firm. I would have given it everything I had if he made a move especially towards my wife and son. I think he knew that. I overheard another guy wearing a UPS uniform complain about me not wearing a mask but he didn't dare confront me and he looked just over 200 pounds. I would have done something if he got brave, I'm tired of this shit.</p>

        <p>And if you end up in jail like Melbourne Australia for literally doing nothing, just because some hopped up cop perceives you as flouting restrictions? A woman had a legal exemption from wearing a mask and it didn't matter, they choked her and threw her in jail anyway. I'd rather actually FIGHT back if the result is the same. The authorities will never be satisfied even with complete compliance. History has proven that. This is the line in the sand that must be drawn, it is time to make a stand and I'm doing it.</p>

        <p>I understand the unpleasant emotions of getting into confrontations about this crap. Stay strong. Don’t cave to the mask madness. Don’t necessarily argue with people either, you can just say “oh” to comments like the one made by your rude punkass Stasi-informer neighbour. Then they’re all disappointed that you didn’t take the bait. If they persist, you can add another “oh” or an innocent “really?”. By then you’ve gotten off the elevator at your floor.</p>

        <p>"People are stupid" is understating it.
People are literally only wearing a mask because someone told them to. And acting all high and mighty as if they're doing it because they're virtuous. </p>
<p>Next time they harass and bully you (that's exactly what this is), ask them this:
"Why weren't you wearing a mask 3 weeks ago before they were mandated? Don't you know you were putting people's lives at risk, like you say I'm doing now? Do you feel at all guilty or ashamed of the fact you were ignorant back then and were helping to spread the virus?"</p>
<p>I'm genuinely curious to see what mental gymnastics they use to rationalise that one. Probably something banal like, "We didn't have all the science back then. Now we know better, so we have to wear masks."</p>
<p>Answer: "Ok, show me the science. I'm not yet convinced, so if you want me to wear a mask, you need to convince me they actually work, and that the virus is as deadly as claimed, and that the benefits of wearing a mask outweigh the mental health/psychological/societal impact of us all wearing them."</p>
<p>They're the ones making the claims that masks save a lot of lives, so the burden of proof is on them.</p>

<p>I think he was trying to tug at my heartstrings or something. "There are people living next to you on that floor, people in our community. And you're putting them in danger." But he was clearly afraid of conflict and wasn't making himself clear, so IDFK.</p>

        <p>Then those aren't neighbors. Maybe community, but not neighbors. That's one the biggest flaws in our current society: overly broad use of terms such as "family", "friends", "neighbors", "community". All that "global village" and "citizen of the world" shit.</p>

        <p>Maybe we should start reverse shaming. How would they like to be called a pussy or hear clucking noises every time they mask up for being afraid of a cold virus? Best case, they realize how idiotic it is for healthy individuals to wear a mask period.  Second best, they STFU and leave all the actually normally behaving unmasked individuals alone.  </p>

        <p>I’ve encountered issues in my building as well, I usually just say “you don’t need to come anywhere near me or ride in the elevator with me then”. Sometimes when I’m really done with it all I just say “yeah medically exempt” and turn around and put earbuds in. It’s true but I don’t always like using that because I wish it didn’t matter why I’m not wearing one</p>

        <p>When the mask mandates first hit my city, my intention was zero compliance, and to claim  an exemption if confronted. I did that once, and it felt wrong to me. It felt like I was making hapless employees' lives harder. So I shifted to minimal compliance - namely, wearing a bandana only to get into stores and when interacting with employees. I'm usually the only bare-faced customer in whatever store I'm at, so at least it's something.</p>

        <p>Stay strong and keep fighting the good fight! I know it’s not easy to become the “other” overnight, as I too refuse to wear a mask in my complex (and for that matter literally anywhere despite my state’s mandatory mask mandate).  </p>
<p>Every time I’m in a store as one of the only (if not only) unmasked patrons, I remind myself that I am NOT the abnormal actor here.  Wearing a mask as a perfectly healthy individual is, in fact,  the grossly abnormal behavior. I am acting normally. Everyone else is not. That fact, and reminder of that fact, is surprisingly comforting AND empowering in the moment.   </p>
<p>On a more serious note, the above reminder does a lot to keep anxiety at bay and stay strong to keep resisting. (It does less to help me from also hating others, which is why I come to threads like this to read posts from people like you as a reminder that I too am not alone.) </p>
<p>Another practice I’ve adopted - when non-employees or fellow residents have commented on my refusal to mask, I simply do not respond AT ALL. I either smile and / or keep dominant eye contact without saying a word until they break away or continue in the direction I was already heading.  Remember that a LOT (if not all) of these mask Nazi types are, at their core, bored / loser busy bodies who get off on telling others what to do. They LIKE the attention of a response when they confront you to mask shame. Like a child throwing a temper tantrum, deny them the attention they so badly crave and eventually they’ll stop throwing their fits. I too look forward to the day we can all return to leaving each other TF alone.  </p>
<p>In summary, never forget (and remind yourself as needed) that YOU are in the right no matter how long this mask BS continues.</p>

        <p>I was thinking this morning about those who need to wear the mask for their profession, We have all seen the pro-mask ads right?  The doctors who are surgeons or the welders etc. The message is that well if we can wear it for 12 hours + a day u can for 20 minutes to go to a store. Well guess what? They “chose “ to wear it when they chose their profession. So pay me a six figure salary so I can run my errands which by the way often takes me more than 20 minutes.....just sayin</p>

        <p>I live in a community which is very diverse and over the last few years have seen a large influx of Asian people. For their own reasons they chose to mask up. This was wayyyyyy before Covid so must be post swine , h1n1. Blah blah  Anyway, I have never encountered even one of them judging or preaching to those not wearing the mask. They live their life and are happy they are protected from the big evil germs that are spreading, God forbid although this is how we build an immune system. So what gives others the right to publically shame us and accuse us for murdering other innocents with our possible germs? Not to mention the anti vaxxers  also known to be common in the Hasidim Jewish community. I don’t see anyone going into their neighborhoods with torches and clubs to call them out! No, it’s plain and simple, those who chose to listen to the Dems and follow their mandates will be rewarded and pat on the back but those that maybe decided to think for themselves are branded as inconsiderate and selfish... to say the least. So not only to we have racial divide ...we now have mask divide.....just sayin</p>

        <p>&rt;so as not to stir shit up</p>
<p>Stir shit up. Don't be weak. Do what you can. Don't give in.</p>
<p>Why would you be worried about stirring shit up? Grow a backbone people. I'm more angry at people who are awake to the bullshit but just wear one because they are scared and just want to make people happy than I am at stupid people who believe the hype.</p>
<p>Stupid people don't know better but you do and you should be ashamed.</p>
<p>Edit: Tell them some people got raped by their dads everyday as a kid and covered their mouth and nose while he did it. That shuts people up.</p>

        <p>&rt;"You need to start wearing a mask. I've seen you around and you're never wearing one."</p>
<p>Reply: 
&rt;You'll never see me wearing one, because the mask mandate <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hui1nd/of_masks_lockdown_and_canada_and_the_violation_of/">violates the Charter and the Ontario Health Care Consent Act</a>. If a policy is illegitimate, we have the <a href="http://ocla.ca/ocla-recommends-civil-disobedience-against-mandatory-masking/">moral duty</a> to practice civil disobedience"</p>

        <p>That sucks. It's hard when you're the one lone person. I'm thankful compliance in my building isn't so high because I really don't want to get into a fight where I live, well a verbal fight since I'm a 5'3'' woman. Actually would probably just be me ignoring them because I'm very conflict avoidant. I'm surprised at myself that I feel so strongly that I'm not following the mask mandate in my building.</p>
