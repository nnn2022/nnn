    <strong>What is the deal with "shedding"</strong>
    <p><p>Been a while since I read up on the vaccine but what is the literature on the "shedding" thing? What is it, what it does, what are the effects, etc etc. My older sister (who still lives with my mother like a fucking bum at the age of 36) got the vaccine and I've heard some rumors about people proximal to "shedders" having miscarriages and losing all their eggs in one heavy period and a bunch of other stuff. It's likely exaggerations but I'd like to see what yall have in store for me. I prefer if it was a study or some sort of collection of data but I understand it can be hard to procure those things especially considering the subject material.</p></p>

        <p>Can confirm. My period is like clockwork, I know the exact day/ time I’ll get it. Since my coworkers have gotten vaccinated my period has not come (and I’m not pregnant). It’s over 2 weeks late and I’m having these weird uti-like symptoms. It’s freaky shit.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's not exactly shedding, but term caught on... It's also easier to say than spike protein transmission (even that's questionable).</p>
<p>I recommend video where 5 doctors discuss about this phenomenon:  http://www.truthunmasked.org/p/stay-away.html?m=1</p>
<p>Let's not forget this is in experimental phase for vaccinated themselves and at that heavily censored, so you gon' get drippings from a tap:</p>

        <p>Shedding is a legitimate concern for some vaccines in rare cases. its process of the body releasing viral particles from a vaccine and creating a risk of infection to others.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't know the validity of it happening with the COVID vaccines, my understanding is that its only possible in vaccines with live-viruses in them, like  MMR, measles, polio, etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm a nurse, and to my knowledge it hasn't been reported to have happened. But who knows..</p>

        <p>Sooooo with the mrna vaccine, it teaches the body to produce the spike proteins that actually make people sick so the body can learn to fight them off, correct? </p>
<p>Do you believe it's out of the question to think its possible to shed those proteins? I mean why wouldn't it be? Our body is constantly expelling our cells all over the place, whether they're dead or alive. </p>
<p>Wouldn't this also heavily imply that body waste would be contaminated with these spike proteins?</p>

        <p>The thing is.. We just don't know. The studies haven't been done, one way or the other.</p>
<p>Your not wrong, but I'm also just not sure if mRNA is expelled from the body in that way.  You could probably make a more credible argument for the AstraZeneca vaccine since it is a modified virus, instead of a modified protein.</p>

        <p>Idkkkkk guys.... not to freak anyone ELSE out (bc truthfully I’m finding myself in a panic right about now) but my period is VERY regular and has been almost my entire life (except for the timeframe that I was on Nexplanon but it’s been 4 years now since having it removed) so, regular period for last 4 years now and I’m over 2 weeks late. 
I LITERALLY THOUGHT I MIGHT BE PREGNANT even though I knew I wasn’t!! 
I took a pregnancy test and it came out negative so why the heck all of a sudden is my period over 2 weeks late and still no sign of it?! It’s been regular, again, nearly my entire life! I am actually panicking about this whole shedding phenomenon. </p>
<p>For ANYONE to actually throw it out the window that it’s “not possible”,..... uhm helloooooo????? Wake up people. If you haven’t noticed that our ACTUAL realities are so fucked up and twisted, literally anything is possible, then clearly you haven’t experienced your rude awakening. With all of that being said ...... should I be concerned?! :x</p>
