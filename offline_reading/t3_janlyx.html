        <p>I new a guy back in college who would obsessively use hand sanitizer. Was a super neat freak and clean freak. Back then, this was considered a mental disorder, and even he would admit that. I'm not sure what the proper medical term is, but I believe its some kind of OCD behavior in terms of germs and cleanliness. </p>
<p>Now the government and media are telling us we HAVE to behave like this, and we're selfish and dangerous if we don't. I've never been a germaphobe, and I can't just start behaving like one just because big gov told me to. It is, and always will be a mental illness to me that I don't want to participate in.</p>

        <p>I saw an online discussion where a woman was concerned about her young son's sudden extreme hand-washing and fixation with germs. Another woman reassured her that in these times that's totally normal and that her own son's hands bleed with how often they're sanitised. I scrolled the thread and just found recommendations for hand cream, nobody said it was obsessive or excessive.</p>

        <p>I used to be like that years ago for a long time. Always washing my hands, wouldn't want anyone touching my belongings or else I would think it's contaminated, wouldn't shake peoples hands, etc. I don't know how, but one year i just stopped being like that. Now I'm like the opposite where I absolutely do not give a fuck about this virus. I don't know how it happened.</p>

        <p>And until this year, not wanting to shake hands or hug was considered a sign of autism/Asperger's or social phobia. Now it's normal. It's interesting just how socially constructed and subject to change our notions of mental disorders are.</p>

<p>We're not denying the existence of Coronavirus, many of us have had a coronavirus in the past. We are pointing out that this particular coronavirus is a lot less dangerous than you seem to believe, and that as a result it's time to return to normal.</p>

        <p>Many countries are returning to the old normal after following quarantine and its rules. While america keeps fighting amidst the pandemic. Sure it's not very deadly but it can be transferred. Even if u dont die or are asymptomatic, u can pass it on to alot more ppl who'll pass it on even more. Some ppl won't have a strong immune system as urs. Why cause their death when you could prevent it. Ever thought about how if America had acted logically, 100k or more deaths could've easily be prevented and you would've been alot closer to the old normal without putting others at danger. </p>
<p>Its no wonder why America's cases and deaths are so much higher than any other country. Half the population is still fighting over its existence or how lethal it is instead of trying to prevent it.</p>

        <p>Go on, dismiss the facts and downvote me if that makes u feel powerful. Each country has been hit differently. Even in a 3rd world country where I'm from, there was a huge 1st wave. Thousands of cases reported per day. We had a strict lockdown for almost a month and now the cases are down. We're not completely out of danger but atleast the restrictions have been lifted to wear masks in every store etc. They're only required in schools colleges etc and heavily crowded places like malls. </p>
<p>From couple 100 deaths per month to barely 40 last month. Glad I'm not from America rn. Go ahead down vote me but do think about how you guys are dismissing 200k deaths every other day coz its causing u a little inconvenience and how you'd feel if someone close to u was in those 200k. Peace :)</p>
<p>P.s: English is not my first language so ignore the mistakes.</p>

<p>So until the vaccine is here and they can get vaccinated, wearing medical masks (which work), and just being courteous to other's space is not being mentally ill, paranoid, nor a "sheep." </p>

        <p>Well, so far every member I had good discussions with didn't listen (I said listen, not change their view) to anything I said whilst I did. I learned something new and now have a deeper understanding of the science behind masks (the truth is, all work, but some are less effective and some have an even higher infection rate in the wearer than unmasked. I'm talking about cloth masks. Properly fitting resirators, medical masks, and masks with proper filtration inserts do work well and have a lower infection rate for the carrier). The fact that all masks work to a degree when used properly is blown off by the redditors in this sub even though their own sources mention the exact thing. </p>
<p>So far every member has been the same. I'd say it's fair enough to label the majority closed minded. </p>
<p>I'm not dictating jack shit, I'm pointing out the painfully obvious. People would listen to you guys more if you weren't so heavily biased. I am not biased and I learned! The people I talked to never learned a thing and called me a sheep, a liar (the facts are in front of your nose and often from your own sources, but okay), and downvoted me to hell. I listed proper sources for my claims that were peer reviewed and contained the good the bad and the ugly (a small percentage of studies had masks show no significant effect but those were due to false info being spread as well as low compliance rates) and I listened to their claims and found many to be false and some to be true. They would ignore mine and just jump straight to something else when confronted.</p>

        <p>Hang on, the point here is that cloth masks aren't used properly by 99% of the general public and even if they were, there is only marginal evidence they have any impact whatsoever. A Danish study found that at the very best they might prevent 1 infection in 200,000.  At an IFR of between 0.1 and 0.3%, that means it is equivalent or perhaps worse than suggesting occupants of a car all wear helmets. That would save lives, but as a society we deem this to be too tiresome to bother with. That is the point here, even if masks produce some tiny benefit, it is so small that it is outweighed by all the negatives associated with mask wearing, and that is IF masks even do produce any benefit, which is far from certain.  What you seem to have done is selectively picked the bits of information that continue to support your preconceived point of view. </p>

        <p>It’s like this. Yes the Rona was what triggered your death, but there was gonna be another trigger sometime soon anyways. 2/3 of deaths with Rona present would have happened within 2 years anyways.</p>

        <p>😂 you realize the flu is a type of coronavirus... there is a successful vaccine for that. </p>
<p>Run its* course is not how you deal with pandemics. Does the flu and cold just "run their course?" No, they come back. Difference being we have a vaccine for that and treatment for the other and the death rate is much much lower than for Covid. </p>
<p>Lockdowns delay overflow of hospitals which subsequently would increase death rates. They are in fact delaying the inevitable, BUT they are delaying the inevitable until the inevitable can be stopped via herd immunity through vaccination, not letting it infect everyone until everyone has had it (which is not going to work since you can get it twice). </p>
<p>How are you going to deal with people who go to work to provide for the vulnerable? Yea.... real good planning. </p>
<p>Sources to the nobel prize winners and such?</p>
<p>Ah yes, just isolate everyone who is high risk and just forget about them. Sounds great</p>

        <p>Yes that was my mistake I mixed up the flu and cold. Sorry, I've been too busy educating others on here that masks fucking work. You are right about the lack of vaccines for coronaviruses, but do I need to point out that there once was a world with no flu vaccine? There's a first for the Covid pandemic and likely a first for the vaccines given how much research is being put into the effort globally. </p>
<p>Your big guy over here is talking about lockdown. I am against lockdown as of now and never mentioned it as of now. Lockdown is the last straw. I'm talking about giving people some damn space wearing masks, wearing them properly, practicing proper respiratory ettiquette, as well as washing your hands and masks. People go to war for this country (as did my father) and this is all you're asked to do. But no. The older generation is right, we're all just a big bag of helpless pussies. </p>
<p>I'm co-founder of a Youth Homelessness group in my city and believe me we are seeing the effects of lockdown. Soooo wearing mask and keeping your distance prevents the need of a lockdown! For seeming more eeucated in this topic than 99% of the morons in this sub, you seem to have troubles understanding that 😊</p>

        <p>Yeah you just lost all credibility when you said the flu virus is a corona virus. You’re a straight up dumb ass.  People here have been following this very closely from the start and are very knowledgeable about this virus.</p>

        <p>&rt;&rt;There is phobia and then there is being responsible.</p>
<p>Indeed. </p>
<p>You and all the other hypochondriac nutjobs are suffering from - wait for it - phobia.</p>
<p>You are stuck in a mass psychosis feedback loop, and your brain is malfunctioning.</p>
<p>All the pablum in the world cannot normalize your insistence that the healthy should strap masks to their faces. That is cultish insanity. It is not based in any form of reality. You have been indoctrinated into a cult, but you don’t realize it. Cultists never realize it. Some do realize it later, if they are able to eventually get out and find their sanity.</p>
<p>Even if your absurd assertion was true - <em>masks work!</em> - whatever the hell that even means - that this therefore means governments should force every man, woman, and child in the world to strap a mask to their face is a non-sequitur.</p>
<p><em>I assert something, therefore government should force the citizenry into compliance!</em></p>
<p>You wannabe authoritarian tyrant-types find this non-sequitur claptrap very compelling, because it allows you to boss people around while feeling like there is some sort of method to your obvious madness.</p>
