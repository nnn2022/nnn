    <strong>Teachers at work discussing vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>I am working in the main office at a summer camp program for a middle school.  The school is in America. Today I overheard two of my coworkers discussing vaccines.</p>
<p>They were concerned for the fall, because many of the grade 6 students were not eligible to be vaccinated, and there was no way to identify which of the grade 7 and 8 students had received it. They said the district needed to find a way for teachers to know vaccination status and suggested masking as a possibility.</p>
<p>I was disheartened to hear this. I don’t discuss such things at work, but it made me wonder how they would feel if they knew I was unvaccinated. </p>
<p>I don’t see the need to have obvious identifiers of who has been vaccinated. There hasn’t been any issue with COVID this summer. It just feels like the media has exaggerated this issue to such an extent that they are demanding these solutions to a relatively small problem.</p></p>

        <p>I went to the mall today, and as I was entering the building, I overheard a couple (both masked) who were discussing vaccine passports, and how they wanted them implemented so they can keep the "disgusting anti-vaxxers" out. I was right next to them, and unmasked, so they glared at me, and purposefully closed the door instead of allowing me through.</p>
<p>Today in general, I felt this...tension in the atmosphere. A lot of masked people were giving unmasked people dirty looks, and it felt like there was animosity brewing in the air.</p>
<p>I've also overheard others discussing how they want the vaccine passports out in the open in public. It's very disturbing, and I'm feeling a lot of despair right now.</p>

        <p>The only war that is being fought is within your mind. Do not fall for the division tactics and take a break from even thinking about covid, just take a minute, center yourself, and truly believe that we will get through this. Message me if you are in crisis, or need to vent. This is all incredibly stressful, so take your time and treat yourself as you would your best friend</p>

        <p>I find it ironic that (at least here in England but I'm not sure about America) most of these vaxed and masked people spent most of last year indoors working their middle class jobs from home, homeschooling their kids. The working class folk went out and brought them their essentials - food, medicine, whatever shit they ordered from Amazon to entertain the kids, looked after their pets, etc. </p>
<p>The people who went out and did that very soon realised that Covid isn't a threat - they were out daily in what was meant to be a pandemic and they were mostly fine. Sure, some of them got sick, had the sniffles for a few days and got over it. But the people who were scooped up in their houses didn't experience this real world interaction and so they stayed terrified. </p>
<p>Still, most of the working class people did go and get their jab - again I'm only speaking for what I know the situation is in England but the uptake of the vaccine here has been excellent. Nearly 90% of all adults now have at least one dose. Almost three quarters of us have both doses. I think that's a lot better than any government could have ever hoped for. </p>
<p>Yet it's still not enough. Working class people are still expected to go out and deliver essentials but middle class people are still terrified so they expect everyone to wear a mask and tiptoe around them because they still don't feel safe.</p>
