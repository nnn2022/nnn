    <strong>The vaccine, PCR test and mask</strong>
    <p><p>I think 90% of us in this section of the forum would agree, there is NO way in hell we are going to get the Covid vaccine. Most us know what’s inside of it, we know their plans and would rather fight and die then have them inject us. It is quite obvious they want ALL us vaccinated with their chemicals, they are pushing it hard and trying to make it mandatory. Covid Pass, Freedom Pass, certificates to travel and go to work showing you been a good little sheep and got injected. It’s just like Nazi Germany having the Jews wear a yellow star. Quantas air claiming passengers will need the vaccine to fly, Ticket Master stating you’ll need the vaccine to go to concerts or sporting events. Soon more companies will slowly announce it and more countries will slowly try and make it mandatory. Many countries are even planning to use the military “armed military” coming to your door. That’s unheard of! Why would they need armed military to come to your door and give a vaccine? Shouldn’t it be in a hospital and those who want it can go get it?   </p>
<p>But what about the Covid test? They been pushing those hard upon people also, trying to get numerous to take them. When you travel to other countries, they literally force you to have a test done. I had a friend travel from the states to see her family in Indonesia and they wanted her to take the PCR test. She refused hard and they had the military there hold her down and literally force her to take it. Then when coming back to the states, they made her take it again and wouldn’t let her leave the airport until she did.</p>
<p>Even many who will refuse the vaccine have taken a test, but people aren’t thinking... What if the test have something on there they want inside us? The way they are pushing them so hard, I wouldn’t be surprised if whatever is in the vaccine is also on the test. Or some form of chemical or nanobots that attack the brain making you dumbed down and compliant. Sounds crazy, but these people are Satanic insane maniacs doing this crap to us. Could this be why there are so many pro lockdown people? People wanting us locked down, wearing mask and obeying all the governments and media say. They are dumbed down by chemicals put in them? <br>
I do believe something is on these test, rather it be something to make us sick, collect DNA or dumb us down.</p>
<p>But now what about mask? We know they are pushing those hard as well, literally forcing us to obey and wear mask everywhere worldwide. Everywhere you go, morons are in mask.. Rather it be inside or outside, even alone in their cars! <br>
Are they putting something on mask as well that we breathe in? Some chemical to dumb us down but it don’t affect all?  There has gotta be a reason “besides a Satanic ritual” that they force these so hard. I believe they have done something to some mask which is why they want us in them so badly.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p></p>

        <p>There is still no evidence of covid reinfecting anyone with a working immune system.   The parent virus, SARS was a one and done virus. So there is no reason to get the vaccine if you were at all active this year.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of points that you bring up that I agree with you on, I think as we have known and are finding out through credible articles/lawsuits that the PCR test is unreliable and produces lots of false positives and it's the reason why they are pushing it hard. I also don't believe the vaccine is safe as we know what's in them but in regards to ticketmaster, they got so much push they had to back down on their statement in regards to needing proof of a vaccine to purchase a concert ticket! What I don't have proof of to provide here but this is only from what I've heard a good portion of the 'rona tests actually were contaminated with the virus on them. If anyone reading this has any proof of this and can provide it, I would be greatful!</p>

        <p>There's no need to put any chemicals in the masks to dumb people down. The oxygen deprivation does that just fine.</p>

        <p>Honestly, how come we've never mandated any other vaccine in human history...every other vaccine is optional but Covid is special somehow? Even with a 99.5% survival rate this virus is feared more than brain cancer or small pox. I call bullshit on this agenda.</p>

        <p>Actually a lot of places do mandate that you have to be vaccinated for certain viruses in order to hold a job or use public schooling.</p>
<p>Here in Maryland when I applied for a job 2 months ago, they asked me which diseases I had been vaccinated in the past for.</p>
<p>Truth be told: I got no damned clue since my now deceased Mom (I'm 40 by the way) kept track of that stuff.</p>
<p>Had to contact my doctor and have them look up my medical records to see what I had been vaccinated for in the past.</p>
