        <p>I agree wholeheartedly, and I think that the part I'm most grateful about is not having to waste my time with going to board meetings to plea my case about why masks should be a choice, and that my child shouldn't be forced to do anything he doesn't want to do. I'm very grateful that his daycare didn't make it mandatory, but I know parents who have students at other daycares that are forcing their kids to wear them--even kids as young as 18 months, which is just absolutely absurd to me.</p>

        <p>Kids need to see people's faces and emotions. Everyone else in face diapers (let me guess, you don't like that word either) is harmful to them and it will just make them antisocial. It's just ridiculous that people would treat their own children that way just because a virus is out there.</p>

        <p>I understand your anger and frustration. I don’t think you have any proof that it’s going to make kids antisocial, or that it’s harmful in any meaningful way. I think you’re afraid that it will, and that’s understandable, but not at all certain. </p>
<p>And you can call a face mask whatever you want, but it’s still just a face mask. And you can call making a kid wear it whatever you want, but it’s not abuse.</p>

        <p>There was a study done to see what happened to kids who didn't see their parents' emotions and they did grow up to be antisocial. It's just not normal and it never will be. It is total abuse. If you can't see that, you have serious problems.</p>

        <p>I’d like to see the study if you have a link or a name so I could check it out. And it’s a little fucked up for you to presume I have serious problems just because I disagree with you labeling masks as child abuse. I’m a person just like you. I’m a parent, I know what it’s like to worry for my kids, and I’m trying to bridge the gap here and have a conversation. Instead of returning the dialogue you’re attempting to humiliate me and bait me. I’ve done my own personal calculus regarding wearing masks, and apparently so have you. We obviously don’t agree on that either, but I’m not calling you names or commenting on your mental health - I’m saying I understand you, even though I don’t agree. </p>
<p>But whatever, I’d still like to read that study, and I’ll never agree that masks = child abuse. I’ve known people abused as children, and it’s not even in the same realm. It feels cruel to spin it that way.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this, I appreciate it. If it is the study they’re talking about, then I think it has several obvious differences from our current situation, and I don’t see how it could qualify as an honest comparison to kids wearing masks. </p>
<p><a href="http://rickackerly.com/2012/03/14/still-face-experiments-are-more-about-power-than-attachment-parenting/">This</a> article explores what the still-face experiment could mean for kids. The author posits that agency may be more important than attachment here. They even use school as a main example for what that could mean for the kid. The author suggests that making kids sit quietly while doing what they’re told for 12 years could have a similar effect on kids’ mental health as the still-face experiment situation. So if this is the study they’re referring to, and they’re comparing still-face treatment to abuse, then we could extrapolate that and say school in general is abuse. Using your phone around your kid is abuse because you’re not paying attention. </p>
<p>You could run wild from that point, and start labeling everything as child abuse, and that’s just one reason why I take issue with OP calling masks for kids child abuse. </p>
<p>Furthermore, covering your mouth and nose isn’t going to  stop someone from communicating, even non-verbally. You still have eyes, hands, and body language, and those things can convey as much or more than words. </p>
<p>If that’s indeed the study he was referring to, I’d love to debate the merits more if someone has a good counterpoint. If that’s not the study, I’d love for OP to chime in and drop a link to whatever they were referring to. And thanks again for the link - didn’t know about this study, but it is fascinating irrespective of the current context.</p>
