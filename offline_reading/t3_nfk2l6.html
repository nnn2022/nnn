    <strong>Look at them like they're idiots</strong>
    <p><p>Thought I would share my first encounter with a certified Covid cultist. This happened about two weeks ago. I am an undergrad university student who doesn't follow any of the idiotic social distancing or mask rules because they're pointless and senseless for a virus with a 99.9% survival rate. I also went to the global freedom rally in Toronto a few days ago (I should be dead right?) Anyway, the weather was super nice outside and my friend and I walked to a nearby friend's house in the university district because he needed us to move a table outside. We were walking back to our house on a one way street on the sidewalk (facing oncoming traffic) and there was a lady (in her early 30s most likely)(mask less) walking towards us on the sidewalk (so walking with the traffic). Around 20 metres ahead of us she stops walking and frantically looks around and says "Where do I go", me and my friend kept walking towards her, not caring, minding our own business, she briefly steps onto the street to try and avoid us to maintain social distancing, but had to step back on the sidewalk because traffic was coming. She then starts angrily yelling at us "to get the fuck off of the sidewalk" so she could walk past us while maintain social distancing. At that point me and my buddy are just like "wtf", but we keep walking towards her not caring so she then proceeds to avoid us by going like 2 metres to the left on someone's lawn and then tells us "she is coming back from the hospital???" and that "we are going to end up in the hospital???". The best part, is she went through so much effort to social distance and she wasn't even wearing a mask. Well, when she started saying "we are going to end up in the hospital", me and my friend just stared at her for a few seconds like she was crazy, then just walked away without saying anything. Guys, this is how you treat these idiots. We could have told her to fuck off or something, but it wasn't worth it. Just look at them like they're morons (which they are). This subreddit keeps growing, we are fighting the good fight, by continuing to peacefully protest against the government's tyranny we get more people to join our side. I don't understand how this woman was trying so hard to social distance outside (where the virus is practically untransmissible) yet she wasn't even wearing a mask. It's like Fauci who is fully vaccinated continuing to wear his mask purely for theatre.</p></p>

        <p>These hyper-sensitive insanely schizophrenic social distancing guidelines are absurd, it’s logically impossible to be six feet from anyone 24/7 and you shouldn’t have social distancing on the top of your mind every damn second.</p>
