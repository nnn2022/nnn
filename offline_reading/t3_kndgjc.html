        <p>I literally just listed the countries above for the reference and have in fact travelled there to see a difference. Two-week quarantine when I arrive and everything. Small businesses are doing okay there. not here. but go off on ignorance I guess? I mean Mongolia and Vietnam are doing well if you're not too bogged down on doing a 2 min google search on them either. </p>
<p>Aren't you upset that peoples lives are so upended by this? What's your solution other than let people die or do literally the bare minimum? cuz if the former, wow I hope you can reason your way to heaven</p>

        <p>You actually believe those numbers?  I thought it was generally understood that the official data from the Chinese government cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>Even if they were actually all true and you can easily eradicate corona by putting everyone on strict house arrest, do you  really think that's a power you want the government to be able to have at their discretion?  If so, for how long do you think it's appropriate to lock people inside of their homes?  1 month, 2?</p>

        <p>Oh no fuck the numbers I'm just seeing how they have full travel and commerce and businesses open. Specifically small businesses. I'm also apprehensive about the government locking us up, but at the same time, I can see the hundreds of thousands of small businesses and countless lives that wouldnt be destroyed if this thing was contained and we can go back to normal. 2 months is long and I'd prefer 2 weeks but "the richest country in the world" literally has the resources to send everyone back their tax payer money to stay in place. Canadians got a couple thousand a month. So did Australia. But instead we send money to Pakistan for fucking gender programs or whatever the fuck and got "blessed" with $1800 for a whole year?? fuck this.</p>
<p>The government is supposed to protect the interest of the people and our interests which includes our health, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are literally all affected by this drawn out pandemic which ISNT CONTAINED.</p>

        <p>I can understand that you are disgusted by Americans and that is the conclusion that you jump to based on your world view but in terms of corona, it does not match the data.</p>
<p>https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</p>
<p>USA is #4 ranked on the per-capita mortality data but for some reason people like you are never calling Italian, Spanish and people in UK horrible names and blaming them for suffering from a contagious disease. </p>
<p>Yeah, it would be nice if the government could keep giving out money to not have people work but that isn't going to be viable long term nor is it guaranteed to have a permanent effect.</p>

        <p>You keep speaking in definites here, like we'd 100% be back to normal if we totally fucked up everyones lives for a couple months. Reality is, we really don't know if that would even be the case. What we <em>do</em> know, is the severe repercussions of all the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns that have been forced upon people.</p>
<p>&rt;if folks didnt whine and complain about masks and took lockdown seriously for a month or two</p>
<p>Yeah, instead we'd be the world leader in unemployment, poverty, starvation, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, terrible education, anxiety, depression, suicide, and plenty of other categories - categories that have already massively spiked due to all the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns.</p>
<p>&rt;we wouldnt be the world leader in cases and deaths for Coronavirus</p>
<p>The US is one of the largest countries in the world. Obviously when a virus thst ravages the entire world, we'll be near the top in cases and deaths. This is to be expected.</p>
<p>&rt;If you want examples of countries that are doing great now</p>
<p>It's silly to try and compare the US with other countries. What works for Taiwan won't work for India, won't work for the US. Every country is different and needs to take a unique approach to this. There's no cure-all solution for this virus. If that was the case, the world would already be back to normal.</p>
<p>&rt;literally if you just do what your fucking government said, it wouldn't have dragged this long.</p>
<p>Again, speaking in a definite when you really have no idea if that would be the case. Also, I really hope you've never jaywalked, gone over the speed limit, smoked weed when it was illegal, or drank underage. That'd be awkward. The government is obviously going to do and say whatever they need to in order to avoid any flak due to this virus.</p>
<p>&rt;I guess America is used to dragging tragedies unnecessarily long and costing billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Funny, cause this is precisely what would happen if we shut down the entire country for a couple months. Just had to throw in an "America bad" comment, eh?</p>
<p>&rt;it didnt help that Trump was so aggro on ignoring the virus, even though he caught it... </p>
<p>Speaking of throwing in comments, gotta make room for an "orangemanbad" remark as well.</p>
<p>&rt;I believe in law and order</p>
<p>Just not basic personal responsibility, evidently. If you're so terrified and paranoid of this weak as fuck virus, you should stay home. Lock yourself down. It's easier than ever to do so. As opposed to demanding that everyone as be as terrified and paranoid as you are, and wanting government to shut down the entire country because of this.</p>
<p>&rt;yall are literally the worst people and a detriment to America's future.</p>
<p>Utterly laughable statement.</p>
<p>&rt;hopefully you live to 2021</p>
<p>Well I dunno. I'm in good shape and in my 20s, so the virus isn't gonna do shit to me. But all of the effects of thesd mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns are way more likely to harm and/or kill me. So as long as we don't go full-lockdown mode like you advocate for, I should be okay :)</p>

        <p>First off, genuinely happy you're of the demographic likely to live. I hope you live a long life and can pass the lessons that only hindsight can provide.</p>
<p>Secondly I'mma just go off the list from your responses:</p>
<p>Yes, I agree we wouldn't know that we'd be 100% okay off lockdowns. But I KNOW that prolonged mandates caused so much harm and the laundry list you provided (US leading in  unemployment, poverty, starvation, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, terrible education, anxiety, depression, suicide, and plenty of other categories - categories that have already massively spiked due to all the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns) (awesome stats btw, lmk where you found sources) </p>
<p>But I'd rather have two months of hard lockdowns than what I can estimate to be a prolonged and dragged out 12 months of this half hearted lockdown bs no? Other countries locked down, got to testing, zeroed in on cases, and monitored the spread when needed. You're right each country is different and the US being its size would, of course, have the most deaths compared to others. But also the US, being of such power with the resources and ingenuity it has, did not step up to the plate and do the bare minimum when it came to holding off soon to be 4 waves of this. We have an infrastructure in place. But the CDC was discredited and all this news of people claiming its not real made it SO much worse. If you're issue is on personal freedom from lockdown, fine, I see your point. But the disease was real and needed to be treated as a threat, not discredited and invalidated. People being a detriment to America's future, I could've retorted better as COVID deniers only. </p>
<p>All the other replies about my comments, I can relent, were spoken in rage and fury and can't be argued. I did speak in definites and admit that I threw the country and some people and leaders under the bus when I should assume everyone is trying their best. America did stay in the ME longer than it should have which is where my " dragging tragedies unnecessarily long" comment comes from but neither here nor there.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Regardless, do I believe we should have locked down hard? yes. But only in hindsight and my regret that I was opposed to it at first. Do I think that it would've helped? I think that what plans we couldve made and concessions to safety protocols made would be better than this 9 months of half hearted lockdown where people didnt take it seriously. I know a whole family eradicated by the pandemic because one person went out to party and went home. I'm upset that while I do the due diligence and suffer at home, jobless, with people I hate, people are not caring and continuing to spread the virus. Definitely isn't helping but yeh. I know I didnt get to all your points but gg on the meticulous response.</p>

<p>All over the place, paired with simple logic. You think all those categories go down or even stay relatively the same with all of the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns? Not a chance. Guarantee most people, particularly the young and healthy, are far more succeptible to being directly harmed/killed by the "cure" than they are the virus itself.</p>
<p>&rt;half hearted lockdown bs</p>
<p>Half-hearted lockdown BS that clearly isn't working. So I'd much rather open things up and go in the other direction, rather than shafting literally everyone in the country for months all fo possibly maybe go back to normal.</p>
<p>&rt;Other countries locked down</p>
<p>And are still going through massive spikes of this. Again, there's really not some kind of cure-all for this. One will succeed with strategy x, while another will fail with that same strategy x. Regardless if you think the US initially handled the virus well enough or not, there's nothing that can be done about it now. We can only act now, and I don't believe that lockdowns right now are the solution.</p>
<p>&rt;the CDC was discredited and all this news of people claiming its not real</p>
<p>Who has legitimately claimed that this virus isn't real? As far as this sub here, we're dedicated to discussion about how this virus is very real, but that the measures taken to combat the virus are far from ideal.</p>
<p>&rt;do I believe we should have locked down hard? yes. But only in hindsight</p>
<p>Course, hindsight will always be 20/20. I just don't think really any place can truly handle this virus well now, let alone could have handled it well a year ago.</p>
<p>&rt;while I do the due diligence and suffer at home, jobless, with people I hate, people are not caring and continuing to spread the virus</p>
<p>I really think opening the country would help you out, and that the lockdowns you rally for would do much more harm than good to you. I believe we should open up while protecting the vulnerable and taking any and all personal precautions needed in order to make someone feel safe. We live with countless risk and danger every day of our lives. So let's open up. You can take your personal precautions, not suffer at home, get a job, get away from peopld you hate, and increase your mental health by leaps and bounds. If someone wants to live at home 24/7, they can. If someone wants to take the risk and live their life as normal, they can.</p>
<p>I'll say that I agree in the sense that I think the only real way we have a shot of getting rid of this virus in the near-ish future is to essentially have everyone wear masks all the time and lock down the whole country for a couple months. But I just don't see that as a viable option, especially at this point. I also think it would do so much more harm than good, particularly for the majority of the population who are young and/or healthy.</p>

        <p>Okay, tell me how I'm wrong and lets discuss, because as stated in another comment " </p>
<p>I'm just seeing how they have full travel and commerce and businesses open. Specifically small businesses. I'm also apprehensive about the government locking us up, but at the same time, I can see the hundreds of thousands of small businesses and countless lives that wouldnt be destroyed if this thing was contained and we can go back to normal. 2 months is long and I'd prefer 2 weeks but "the richest country in the world" literally has the resources to send everyone back their tax payer money to stay in place. Canadians got a couple thousand a month. So did Australia. But instead we send money to Pakistan for fucking gender programs or whatever the fuck and got "blessed" with $1800 for a whole year?? fuck this.</p>
<p>The government is supposed to protect the interest of the people and our interests which includes our health, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are literally all affected by this drawn out pandemic which ISNT CONTAINED."</p>
