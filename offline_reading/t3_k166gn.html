        <p>Classic illogical restriction is I can go to a bar and get shitfaced, but itâ€™s too dangerous for my kid to go to school. And god forbid they play basketball in a public park when looking for something to do. This is a pandemic for gods sakes!</p>

        <p>The reasons why transmissions are more likely at home than at a restaurant:</p>
<ul>
<li>We know now that covid is spread primarily through aerosol transmission - tiny particles floating in the air. <a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html">This study</a> shows how the size of a space has a dramatic effect on aerosol transmission.  You're going to be more at risk in a typical apartment or living room than in a 2,400 sq ft restaurant with 12-15 ft ceilings.</li>
<li>At a restaurant, people from different households should not be coming into close contact with one another without masks. In a private setting, people are unlikely to wear masks at all.</li>
<li>The duration of aerosol exposure is also a factor in transmission, with risk increasing substantially at exposure time of longer than 2 hours. Most restaurant stays are less than 90 minutes. Most private visits longer than 2 hours. </li>
</ul>
<p>These risk factors are borne out in infection data. In my province, 40 per cent of traced transmissions are from private homes, while only 4 per cent are from restaurants and bars. </p>
<p>Public health authorities have not done a great job explaining these risk factors to the public (maybe they assume it's just too complicated to bother trying). But we shouldn't assume the restaurant vs private home policies are all about economics.</p>
