    <strong>My wife was refused a covid test at the local hospital today.</strong>
    <p><p>So my wife is having an elective surgery not being performed at a hospital next week. One of her pre-op conditions is a negative covid test. She called one of the two local hospitals and was denied a test because they only perform tests for patients scheduled for procedures at their hospital. She called the other hospital and was only able to schedule because she had a doctor’s referral. We must be in a pandemic when you have to call around town to get tested for the new plague.</p></p>

        <p>I had to wait in my car on a line for like 2.5 hours to be able to get a surgical screw removed.  I was pissed about that, then my husband told me about his coworker who was in an ATV accident and broke bones that required surgical repair.  They had to suffer for several days waiting for test results.  I would have hated to see what would have happened if those results came back positive...</p>

<p>I'm really not sure they were telling you the truth. The rapid test for pre-ops is back in 2-4hours. The slow routine ones are within 24.</p>

        <p>When I had mine, I had a test that came back in about 24 hours but the delay was in the results from the testing company to the surgeon's office.  They made me get a test 4 days prior to scheduled surgery due to this lag.  Health care in NM is amateur hour.  Everything was allegedly under one health care system, but what lies beneath is an amalgamation of contracted companies, including both surgeon and testing company.</p>

        <p>The negative test is due firstly GA is an aerosol generating event and thus a risk to the health care workers and so they can ensure safety with bed arrangements, shared rooms etc.</p>
<p>Why couldn't she have it done at the operating hospital?</p>

        <p>The procedure isn’t being performed at a hospital. It is a private practice and an outpatient procedure. The complaint isn’t that she needs the test. That’s understandable. The issue is that in a “pandemic” you can’t get a hospital or clinic to give you a test without a doctor’s order. It’s a sham and a fraud.</p>

        <p>Its still a medical test, it still falls until the remit of a doctor.</p>
<p>I'm more surprised the private practice isn't doing it.</p>
