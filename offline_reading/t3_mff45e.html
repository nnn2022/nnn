    <strong>Anyone else notice this?</strong>
    <p><p>It has been an entire year of this bullshit and I don’t have any connections to literally a single person who has died from the virus in my real life. On the contrary, my coworker’s nephew just recently killed himself two weeks ago (25 yo), my coworkers friend’s son killed himself a few months ago(mid 20s), my coworker’s cousin killed himself in January in my neighboring town (17 yo), different kid in my neighboring town killed himself in October (15 yo)...why am I hearing about all these deaths but no one I know in person is dying from this “deadly pandemic???” All this bullshit is planted in the media makes people think everyone who gets the virus gets hospitalized and dies. I’m so sick of these people who sit in their houses all day drooling in front of their phones and TVs thinking everyone who is living their lives normally is out of their minds, when nothing is fucking happening.</p></p>

        <p>This is a fun one, but my favorite is how the homeless population in Los Angeles is exploding, and there's no way it wouldn't be ravaging that entire community if it were real. It's the most obvious indicator to me.</p>

        <p>Nope, haven't heard a single thing.  My kid goes to judo practice 3 times a week, probably around 50 people packed into a small room with no masks.  We've been doing this for almost a year now and have had no incidents yet.  Such a deadly virus.</p>

        <p>Isn’t it bizarre? So many obese, elderly people I see walking around- from the media they would for sure be dead already from this “deadly virus” but they aren’t? And the fact that there are young people who are scared of a virus that has a 99.997% survival rate for their demographic.. sooo odd to me</p>

        <p>My favorite are the selfies. I've seen so many people take them at the beach in masks. Like if they remove them for the 10-15 seconds it take for the picture, the evil virus will fly in their noses. </p>
<p>I saw one of a family of 5 taking pictures infront of a mountain with no one around them and all wearing masks. It boggles my fucking mind how stupid people are. It's actually scary.</p>

        <p>and most “covid death” anecdotes are very suspect. </p>
<p>the testing diagnostics and symptoms mixed with pre existing conditions never paint a clear picture that says “covid did this”</p>
<p>for all we know, many of these “covid deaths” were just rebranded flu deaths. </p>
<p>the PCR was abused and misused, and many people simply died of other ailments and were tagged covid deaths. </p>
<p>many died from being put on ventilators. </p>

        <p>One of my former students ended her life. Her dad blames it 100 percent on lockdown. She was already marginal, being completely isolated from friends and activities pushed her to do the worst. My brother’s boss in another state died early on of covid. Like you, I’ve known several people who have tested positive but no deaths or even hospitalizations.</p>

        <p>Yup. I only know one person who had it and said it was nothing, yet I know of 3 people who have committed suicide. Just heard of another person who is unknown to me jumping off of their building a couple days ago. My friend looked down and saw the aftermath. </p>

        <p>Same. Not a single person, and I went out my way to try and catch it. I was in Taiwan when it broke out in China, flew to Hong Kong where I stayed for a month, then left to Scotland, U.K. where I attended a Chinese New Year gala staffed by Wuhanese. The western manager who I know well had just that day returned from a business trip to Wuhan, she gave me a hug, nothing came of it.</p>
<p>I then spend the rest of that year (2020) going round the worst hit cities (Glasgow, Birmingham, London) all the while back to live with my gran who’s in her 80s. 
I stayed in hostels in these cities when I wasn’t home, and went out during two lockdowns, was eating and queuing in McDonalds, talking to homeless junkies in Glasgow, didn’t even buy a mask till around August. </p>
<p>Family have come and gone too to visit my old gran, never once had the symptoms. Just seems like a load of bullshit to me</p>

        <p>Going to go against the grain here. Multiple people in my family have died from it, and multiple acquaintances, especially the elderly. I know a lot of  people who were sick.</p>
<p>However I also know that lockdowns past this point are not the answer, and vaccine passports should not be a thing.</p>
<p>Just because your community has been lucky doesn't mean others have also. The virus still exists and is a problem for some, but we can still be on the same side about the lockdowns when a vaccine finally exists.</p>

        <p>I'm always baffled by the people who say multiple family members have died.  Elderly?  Grandparents?  Not to rub salt in wounds but was it something collectively they were doing that put them at risk?  I don't really buy the 100 degrees of separation/asymptomatic route of transmission idea.  Usually if someone gets sick it's from someone they've had contact with regularly for an extended period of time.</p>

        <p>Multiple people died directly from covid and one died absolutely not from covid, but the hospital tried to pin it on covid. The exact phrase was "possibly covid" lol. </p>
<p>The elderly were being taken care of by nurses and/or by family who had no choice but to go to work. It's not all a utopia where they can perfectly isolate. People can't get that through their heads.</p>
<p>Also know multiple doctors and staff who got sick. They had no choice but to work.</p>
<p>Just because these people got sick and died because they couldn't isolate 100% doesn't make it their fault or deserving. Plus most people in the elderly category can't take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Edit: also maybe before being baffled, consider the circumstances people have to live in are not the same as yours.</p>

        <p>I know a COVID death.. it was from a 400lb woman in her 40's.  My mom likes to use her death as to why we should take COVID seriously. When I tell her she wasn't healthy, she responds "Oh she was a little overweight but nothing else was wrong with her". A little? She was super morbidly obese which is technically a medical condition of itself!</p>

        <p>Neither do I. I picked it up before we became obsessed with testing and got over it after a few days. If it's possible to get reinfected, it sure won't work on me because I don't take any precautions. I couldn't get it if I tried. </p>

        <p>I got covid, thanks god it was just a fever, but my neighbor was crying because his kid (17-18 yr) died from covid. So yeah, you might not have heard anyone you know dying from it, but that doesn't mean that it is a lie. And yeah, young people kills themselves. Is a problem that exist from a good amount of time already. Maybe the lockdown was worst for the mental health and was a cause of the suicide of people, but it was not the main reason nor the only one. The lockdown is definitely something bad, but it is because Covid is not just a random joke. It can kill, and if it doesn't kill you, it will make you suffer. And after you get it once and survive it, there is a chance that it can get you again and be worst than before. And because it is so contagious, there will be a big possibility to you get it again. The masks are not only to protect you, are  also to protect others, because if you get it the mask will help you to not give it to someone else. I'm from Brazil, so here is quite worst, and at the same time I don't really know exactly how is it in North America, but I'm pretty sure is not good. </p>
<p>But well, I will probably get downvoted or ignored because I'm saying truths, but I don't really care. To everyone who is reading this, take care of yourself and others and stay safe. Have a good day/afternoon/night.</p>

        <p>First, of fucking course I fear the coronavirus. I don't want a friend or someone of my family to die or suffer to it. And what I'm saying is that the suicides is less preventive, I think was the word. Now, with a lockdown, using some simple mask and just trying to be away of people  I can help to get less people with coronavirus and at the same time help to anyone of my family to get it. Is so fucking simple to understand that after what I saw in this sub I'm not surprised you can't understand it, but my english is also quite bad so maybe that was one of the reasons. Suicide is something that can happen for so many reasons that the best way to prevent it from happening is when the person is in a point that it almost doesn't matter, in a point were the person is convinced that suicide is the best answer. Of course, if I could help three or fourth kids and take them out from the path that it is the depression with not using a mask and not doing shit to stop the coronavirus I would definitely do it, because in the end I would be helping more than if I help fighting the corona. But, until that happens (and will never happen because there is no fucking reason to not use a mask and there aren't that many suicides in my area, and I don't really know nobody so I just can't have a oportunity of it) I will use masks and do what is needed to stop the corona because, different of people like you, I'm just simply not stupid. In the end, the only things you need to do is to put a mask, something that doesn't really bother, and if posible not go close to people. If you need to go to work, then just put a mask, it won't kill anybody, literally. Until now, not even ONE of you has showed me anything that could convince me that y'all aren't incorrect. Until now, the only things I receive are insults or people misunderstanding what I mean (or a random guy calling me a bot for some reason.... Yes I'm looking at you Corner). I don't even know because I try to convince you, because in the end it is like that popular phrase "Is hard to win a discussion with a genius, but it is impossible yo win against a stupid".</p>
<p>Have a good day.</p>

        <p>Well, that's obvious. But there is nothing I can do about it. I can't help you to not be suicidal, because I don't knoW shit about you. But I can still help that someone won't have covid, and that could save a life. </p>
<p>Remember kids, that something didn't happened to you or someone you know doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I never met someone that killed himself, so now suicidal is just inexistent? Just think, for once.</p>

        <p>Hmm that seems legit, so maybe masks are not really that good, but they are still useful. Well, this is not something I can change your mind of it, but, if you are not going to wear a mask at least keep yourself away from people. Even if is 6 feet (how much is that in meters?) or 200. And if you can only enter a place with mask, then just go inside with the mask. I get that they can bother, I use glasses and it gets all foggy and can't see shit, but I use it, because even if it can be harmful to some people it definitely is not to me. And probably not for you too. So using it for let's say 20 minutes is nothing. It won't kill you, actually it even might help you against covid. I stayed for more than 30 hours in a row with my mask on, and I'm quite healthy. </p>
<p>Look, for everyone that reads this, I don't give a fuck if you use a mask anymore, but at least don't bother others because they need you to use a mask. If you go into a shop and they won't let you do shit because  you are without a mask, just put it on. Even if is for ten minutes. It won't kill you and you won't bother anyone. I, personally, will still use the mask because:</p>
<p>First, is cool af</p>
<p>Second, it does help, even if a little.</p>
<p>Third, is an obligation. I must use it. </p>
<p>And fourth, my father is 50 years old, and I will do anything to keep him safe from this virus. Even if it could be like a flu to him, I won't let it.</p>

        <p>That’s all you people do- sit at home all day and talk about some random person you knew through some random person that “died of covid probably from not wearing a mask.” I know these people, nothing better to do with their lives than talk about the deadliness of corona and shit talk everyone who goes out with these meaningless anecdotes, trying to push their agenda... if that’s not exploitative, I don’t know what is</p>

        <p>I hope that galaxy brain rant made you feel better, it's still exploitative to use other peoples mental health and suicides to validate you COVID-19 denialism. That's what you are defending and do all day. Go check yourself scumbag.</p>

        <p>So are we just going to ignore mental health problems because it’s “exploitative” to talk about them? yes, great idea. Let’s ignore everyone’s suffering, and let’s keep the fact that there is a drastic rise in suicide as something that can only be talked about as <em>hush hush</em>. </p>
<p>These problems need to be addressed. Sorry you want to keep youth deaths a secret, and make everyone feel bad about themselves for 90 year old grandma. Sorry that these are where your morals lie</p>

        <p>Yeah that's the thing, buddy. You've almost got it. Something at this level, and of this scale, would affect every single person within at least two degrees of separation. That's the point bro. If this was such a deadly, wide-reaching virus, you would personally know people. A lot of them.</p>

        <p>Don't be too sure. Most of them are just cowards that know better in their heart, but they're too cowardly to say anything. If they can feel comfortable knowing that we see the bullshit too, they might be more willing to admit how they really feel.</p>

        <p>there has been 550k deaths from covid in the us since the beginning of the pandemic. That represents 0.16% of the population. That's 1 in 600 people. Most of them are older people. Now how many old people do you know enough to hear if they would've passed away, I bet not alot. It isn't unlikely you would know somebody who would've died from covid. Personally I know a women that passed away from covid in my family.</p>

        <p>Then the old people that are scared can lock themselves up and do what they want to do to “protect” themselves. Plenty of delivery services like Instacart, Uber eats, Amazon to bring them everything they need while they sit at home in their safe little bubble. Don’t force me to comply for a couple old people (even though the death rate even for elderly is less than 10% after catching covid).</p>
