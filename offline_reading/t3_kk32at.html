        <p>This really is the crux of it. </p>
<p>There needs to be some kind of extreme revolution in the way media is done. What's going on at the moment is utterly unacceptable. People are so indoctrinated by nonsense fed to them by CNN/BBC/etc etc it boggles my mind. But they trust these sources and as long as that remains true they'll believe the bullshit narratives.</p>
<p>Few people seem able to break away from the sensationalist garbage spewed every day. And if they don't, they're fully blown doomers and you can't talk sense into them no matter what; they've got an overconfidence in their position owing to the firm belief that they are in the mainstream majority and that therefore that must be rational.</p>
<p>I used to pitty these folks; now I'm angry at them. The media has to be changed.</p>

        <p>You realize that ‚Äúcovid patients‚Äù (people who test positive for covid) are isolated to their own space in the hospitals (the ICU) regardless of severity of symptoms because of the CDC mandates on how covid patients should be handled in respect to other hospitalizations?</p>
<p>This practice fills ICUs quickly as their capacity is heavily diminished by the distancing and quarantine protocols hospitals have to follow which reduces overall beds available.</p>
<p>If it‚Äôs as bad as they claim why are there less total deaths nationally in 2020 than in 2018?</p>

        <p>You see, since 2020 isn't over yet, it's impossible to give anything but "expected" numbers for the year. That is why your link is to data that gives "projections" that also clearly includes a disclaimer that may have slipped your eye despite its particularly fetching red warning box:</p>
<p>&rt;NOTE: All 2020 and later data are UN projections and DO NOT include any impacts of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>If you're not illiterate or some kind of troll purposely spreading misinformation, try actually reading your source material. This is all without pointing out the numerous non-covid deaths that the lockdowns and restrictions have prevented, as clearly you're incapable of understanding principle data, let alone nuance.</p>

        <p>Basically, being contradictory. She says to her online friends to follow the guidelines and wear their cheap inefficient surgical masks, but when it comes to actually dealing with the virus she wears the full kit. In my view, if we were to be as concerned as she wants us to be, we would all be doing what she is taught at work to ‚Äòstop the spread.‚Äô But she has accepted, just like everyone else, that these masks are good enough. (They are just one step in the total method of protection from transmission).
Also: she‚Äôs obese.</p>
<p>Edit: you could say she works in a field which is built on the implied premise that health is a value and specific actions must be taken to gain and keep it, but she only practices that knowledge at work, not in her personal life</p>

        <p>Here's an interesting thing -</p>
<p>I have two nurse friends, both in ICU.</p>
<p>One nurse works at one of the biggest hospitals in my county and she says that covid-19 cases aren't as bad as they were/they aren't overwhelmed with cases/etc.</p>
<p>The other nurse works at one of the other biggest hospitals in my county and she already got the vaccine/posts aggressive crap against people who make light of covid-19/talks about all the deaths etc.</p>
<p>These are both in Southern California. So, who is telling the truth? If one huge hospital isn't overrun, then how is the other one overrun? Doesn't add up. Doesn't make sense. Two nurses telling two completely different stories. One sees family and friends and doesn't wear a mask, the other is the complete opposite.</p>

        <p>I find some doctors and nurses really like it's a serious thing because they feel more important. I mean I guess it's human. Most of us want to feel needed or important. But some exaggerate to keep that feeling of importance.</p>

        <p>I feel like that's the case too. For instance with my friend who  makes it out to be a big deal...she only shares things on instagram about how bad it is that are from <em>other</em> nurses from <em>other</em> hospitals. Never her first hand accounts. The other nurse friend isn't even on social media so maybe there's my answer ü§£. </p>
<p>The sad truth is that people get sick and die. Whether it be from covid, the flu, cancer, whatveer it may be. The Not ok thing is that deaths are being put down as covid when it's not even covid related. My friends dad was put down as a covid death even tho he was negative (he had lung problems that turned to cancer) and he was in a facility for very sick, terminal old people. If anyone tested positive for covid they had to leave. We need to stop being lied to about the numbers. It's not adding up.</p>

        <p>Yeah a lot of people are being put down for it when they aren't.  It's due to the CDC expanded definition which could include just about anyone with one or two common respiratory symptoms.  </p>
<p>https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/</p>
<p>Also even if you test positive it doesn't mean you actually have it.  You could have had it 3 months ago and still have particles of the virus in your system.</p>

        <p>That's why it's so frustrating that they are pushing testing so much. Idk how accurate it is, but I've been reading about people getting the flu shot and then testing positive for covid. These tests are not accurate and people need to just stop getting tested so dang much.</p>

        <p>So freaking frustrating. In the beginning of this whole thing, a doctor said "if we didn't know anything about covid-19, we would just look back and think we had a really bad flu season". Something needs to change, that's for sure.</p>

        <p>My local news station ran a story today about nurses pleading how bad it is and for people to stay home. Our ER saw around 10 patients last night. Two admits to the whole hospital, both went to my floor: an elderly man with acute kidney injury and an elderly man with post-abdominal surgery complications. Our Covid ward even has empty rooms.</p>

        <p>I've been a cna for nearly 10 years and my mom was a cna back befor I was born then became a surgical teck later on. In all that time both from my moms experience and my own experience I can say that this has all been completely normal. Hospitals  always run on skeleton crew, they are greedy. I even remember one time working assisted living we ran out of gloves and I had to use garbage bags as gloves. Employees and supply's are always at bare minimum and patients are always at or near capacity. That's how the greedy big whigs make the most money.</p>

        <p>Thank goodness! It's great to finally hear from a sane nurse. I am also a nurse and it's really hard to see the numbers of nurses and other medical workers going along with things and not challenging it. She is completely right.

        <p>Gets uncommon if you consider its because the nurses are sick as well, in addition to the hospital being WAY beyond capacity. I can't open the link because of geographical restrictions, but from the headline it says they asked flu patients to stay away. The hospital in my hometown asks EVERYONE to stay away. They couldn't even take someone in with a major head injury</p>

        <p>That can very well be the case, I'm not debating that. But the fact that, like you said, only for the most part hospital capacity is fine, but not in all cases, supports my initial argument that this tweet is indeed nonsense, since it illustrates one nurses experience and adapts it to the whole pandemic in general</p>

        <p>She was talking about the US.  And yes it's bad in a few cities, but almost all the rest can handle the load.  You are right she is exaggerating, but not by much.  At least not at the moment.  </p>
<p>The problem is the media here only shows the full hospitals and pretends it is happening all over the country when it is far from the truth.  So she is probably speaking out of.emotion against that.</p>

        <p>And that's my problem with this tweet. She's exaggerating. I'm not trying to argue by how much she is, because I'd guess we both realize how far apart our opinions are on that topic, but the wording is wrong either way. She's using definitive words and phrases like "no hospitals", "supposed to be full" and of course "this is pandemic 100%". And by that, she's selling pure propaganda (propaganda not used judgingly) as a genuine fact based on professional experience. That's what I have a problem with. I can accept (not understand, but accept) that people believe things like this, but what she's doing is wrong. As an example I could say:</p>
<p>"My friend who's a nurse told me how their hospital is completely overwhelmed because of covid and people are dying left, right and centre. All hospitals are like that. This is 100% the deadliest thing we have ever had".</p>
<p>We both know that'd be a wrong interpretation of his own experience in ONE hospital.</p>
<p>(btw, I appreciate the very civil and open-minded tone of this discussion)</p>

        <p>You have a point. It's the emotions that push it over into exaggerated territory. I think she did it to counter the constant news stories doing the opposite.  Similar to your quote above.  That's exactly what they are doing every day.  Representing a small sector of hospitals as what is going on all over. </p>
<p>So people that know the data of what is going on get mad that 80% the country believes that hospitals are overflowing everywhere because of media reports like that.</p>

<p>I have friends in healthcare as well.  One works for admin for a large hospital network.  She said there are more staff out for COVID than COVID patients.</p>
<p>Here's a CEO of a hospital  in Texas:</p>
<p>https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/texas-government-counting-every-covid-positive-hospital-case</p>
<p>&rt;The number of hospitalizations are "being misinterpreted," said Houston Methodist CEO Marc Boom,¬†"and, quite frankly, we‚Äôre concerned that there is a level of alarm in the community that is unwarranted right now."</p>
<p>&rt;He pointed out that his hospital one year ago was at 95% ICU capacity, similar to the numbers the hospital is seeing today. "It is completely normal for us to have ICU capacities that run in the 80s and 90s," he said. "That's how all hospitals operate."¬†</p>
<p>Only 3 states right now have above 80% average occupancy.  You can see the majority of the country is below average occupancy:</p>

        <p>They aren't just not at Max capacity, they are low for this time of year. </p>
<p>Cases are skyrocketing because testing is skyrocketing and PCR testing gives a lot of cold positives ( many PCR positives of asymptomatic people are from people who already recovered and aren't even sick). </p>

        <p>True maybe there are a lot of false positives but still 18.7mill cases is a lot, but not everyone that has corona has to go to the hospital. But still cases are spiking. But yes in my country too there are not a lot of other illnesses, a friend of mine is a pharmacist and she said to me that people arent buying as much diverse medicine as they used to and idk why but it is weird. Yet their are still a lot of corona cases and we need to do something about that. (Ngl this sub do shows it colors when someone with a different view on corona and i dont even attack you and still people downvote me, kinda annoyinging.)</p>

        <p>It's probably close to 150 million.  What data to you have to say it's too much?  Or are you just using your feelings?  Kind of like people used their feelings to go overboard and lockdown.  Now suicides, drug overdoses, child abuse, domestic abuse, homelessness, unemployment, and more are up.</p>

        <p>About that 150 mil is maybe a bit much but look, i know that we need to protect the vulnerable but who is that exactly? You can have kids that are vulnerable, you have young adults that are vulnerable you have 40+ that are vulnerable. You cannot just say that ‚Äúthey‚Äù need to do things and sometimes you can be the most healthy person and still die because you had a bad reaction to it. And we cant just go on when this virus is on the loos, i know that a lot of people wont die from it but they will be very sick and (a lot of people forget this) the aftermath of the virus. Not taste, no smell, shortness of breath, and maybe even more but some people never 100% recover. We need to get this under control and fast.</p>

        <p>Kids aren't vulnerable.  Only 400 died under 18 in the whole country. More die from the flu than COVID.  </p>
<p>75% of deaths are 65+. There are your vulnerable.</p>
<p>You don't lock down to make things worse.  You realize 1/3 of excess deaths this year are not even COVID deaths?  Your Moronic lockdowns have killed more under 45 than COVID itself.  Kids are committing suicide due to lockdowns</p>

        <p>No you didn‚Äôt understand me i meant that kids can have another illness making them ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù and the same with every age category. The lockdowns were inforced when there was a big spike most of the time and the economic crisis will last but will not kill more people probably, that also depends on the country of course. In the 1930 the USA survived a crisis in 2008 i think there was another one in the USA and i think we get a big hit but eventually we will come back. And hey its not every year we have such a big pandemic, so when the economy gets hurt its gonna sting but its necessary to succeed. I do think we can change some regulations but again they are different in every country so we cant really discuss that. These are harsh times.</p>

        <p>from the article: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in practice for 30 years, and it‚Äôs been a good 15 or 20 years since I‚Äôve seen a flu-related illness scenario like we‚Äôve had this year.‚Äù</p>
<p>of course hospitals have had to do this before, but its not common and it wasnt nearly on the same scale as it is this year. it was tents and waiting rooms in 2018, now we have tents, waiting rooms, hallways, parking garages, stadiums, schools.. not to mention the fact that the overcrowding was a flu season issue in 2018, but its been like this since summer.</p>
<p>and my question still stands, wouldnt you want less deaths? just because its been like this before doesnt mean we have to accept it.</p>

<p>One in 2014 told patients to not come to the hospital.  And why does listing different locations for patients increase the severity?  It is based on emotion.</p>

        <p>because the fact that people are being treated in parking garages is absurd and the fact that people still think this is a hoax is even more absurd. you ignore the millions of nurses and doctors saying that this is real and should be taken seriously but take the word of one nurse since her views align with yours. </p>
<p>look at the total number of deaths this year compared to averages of years before. there are significantly more deaths from any cause this year than last year. in april 2019, there were 235,000 total deaths. 321,000 this past april. thats a pretty significant difference. take into consideration that people were staying home, so there were probably less car accidents and other similar types of deaths, and that makes that difference even more significant. you still havent answered my other questions either. cant beat ignorance I guess ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>

        <p>No one said it's a hoax.  You could say being treated in tents is absurd or worse telling people not to come to the hospital is absurd.</p>
<p>Why are you telling me the number of deaths?  I'm well aware of the stats.  </p>
<p>I didn't see your question.  Yes I would want less deaths.  That's the same question I would ask you if you are advocating for lockdowns.  Because 1/3 of the excess deaths this year aren't even from COVID. Suicides, drug overdoses, child abuse, domestic abuse, unemployment are all up.  The economy fallout of lockdowns will last for years.  Killing many more than COVID itself.</p>
<p>And covid is killing mainly people near the end of their lives.  The effects from lockdowns are killing kids (suicides) and under 45 (suicides and drug overdoses).</p>

        <p>fair enough, the vibe I got from this sub is that its mainly denial/anti-mask/conspiracy stuff. </p>
<p>look at other countries though. they had much more restrictive lockdowns than us and arent nearly in as bad of shape as we are. people listened in march and stayed home and wore masks, and most stuff was reopened relatively quickly. afaik australia and new zealand are pretty much back to normal. other countries are in lockdown again, but at least they got a break in the middle to recover and will be able to recover quickly from this one since their cases arent as out of control. </p>
<p>personally Im not calling for full shutdowns or anything here again because we saw how that worked in this country in march, and long term shutdowns are negatively affecting health in different ways like you said. so many businesses have spent money on PPE, plexiglas dividers, etc. and itd be shitty for them to get shut down again. but theres no reason why there isnt a mask mandate or why wearing/not wearing a mask has become a political statement. all businesses should have to meet certain standards to remain open as well, and should receive aid if they cant afford it. the massive amounts of disinformation and baseless conspiracies being spread arent helping either. and if our government didnt spend months arguing over whether or not we should get $600 while lining their own pockets and passing out cash to corporations our economy wouldnt be in such bad shape either. from average citizen to president this country has handled the situation terribly. </p>
<p>at your last point though, a large portion of younger people that recover are left with permanent side effects, which should be taken into consideration.</p>

        <p>There are significantly more Covid cases now than there were this summer. Where are the field hospitals, hospital ships, and demand for travel doctors / nurses?</p>
<p>Nurse for 10 years. Hospitals go on divert all the time because they‚Äôre full.. so patients get sent to surrounding hospitals. This isn‚Äôt shocking to anyone who works in the medical field. What is more shocking to me is that I haven‚Äôt seen any hospitals on divert yet this year. </p>
<p>Deaths are not up. The main part of my job is to literally monitor the feed of people discharging from the hospitals - that includes deaths. At the beginning there were Covid deaths. 30-45 the first 2 months. In the last 3 months, I‚Äôve had 2 Covid deaths. On an average day, I talk to 5 Covid patients that were discharged home. </p>
<p>COVID is a real virus but the worldwide response to it is an absolutely disgusting attempt to take control of people with fear by disguising propaganda as ‚Äúscience‚Äù. WAKE. UP.</p>

        <p>The issue is likely understaffing issues.  And yeah some areas are having problems but the majority is completely fine.</p>
<p>https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-capacity</p>
<p>Like the CEO said in the article I posted, the media is exaggerating the capacity issue.</p>
<p>&rt;The number of hospitalizations are "being misinterpreted," said Houston Methodist CEO Marc Boom,¬†"and, quite frankly, we‚Äôre concerned that there is a level of alarm in the community that is unwarranted right now."</p>
<p>&rt;"There is not a scenario, in my opinion, where the demand for our beds ... would eclipse our capability," he continued. "I cannot imagine that. I just cannot."</p>

        <p>Staffing is the biggest issue, and ALL media likes to exaggerate, but it's not like there's no concern here. I'm a bit confused by your point. Are you trying to push that things aren't so bad so we shouldn't take anti-covid measures until a vaccine becomes widely available?</p>

        <p>Lol okay I see how it is. I hope one day you'll learn that there's such a thing as nuance, and be able to process that sometimes there isn't a perfect response to a terrible situation. Spreading panic is what MSM does, but being dismissive of the entire situation because you have a skewed perspective from individual news sources catering to your paranoia is irresponsible and moronic.</p>

        <p>It's what you are doing too.  Look at the HHS link I posted.  The averages for the country are low for this time of year.</p>
<p>There are only 3 states with higher than 80% occupancy right now:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/kiql0w/hospitals_are_overflowing_with_covid_shut_it_all/</p>
<p>Hospitals get overwhelmed from time to time, it's nothing new.  Here's 2018 where they had to treat people in tents.</p>

<p>So, yes there is nuance.  But the situation in general is completely under control.  So keep fear mongering in the rest of reddit where the rest of the panic addicts will jerk you off.  We are trying to counter you twatfaces.  You're the losers that have killed the economy, increased suicides, drug overdoses, child abuse, domestic abuse, etc with your panic driven lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Yes, I do. Many people are social distancing. And because it's not about an absolute lockdown, it's about minimizing risk to minimize cases, it's as close to a responsible response as we can hope for. If we had a perfect lockdown, we'd have much less cases, but I that's impossible.</p>
<p>Every little thing helps. Masks and social distancing aren't perfect, but every single transmission prevented is another potential vector stopped.</p>
<p>Yeah, I totally agree that the picking and choosing is shameful and is either a symptom of the corporate money in politics or a ham fisted solution to avoid judging each and every business on an individual basis. Could be both.</p>
<p>The appropriate response can be debated, but minimizing covid like the well-spoken OP doesn't help.</p>

<p>My issue with all of this is there is no end game. That concerns me and I think that‚Äôs why a lot of people venture into being skeptics because everything about this has been sketchy and our government has not been honest. That on top of picking and choosing what gatherings are acceptable (protests and celebrations vs freedom protests and bars/restaurants) and then violating their own lockdown rules, prove they don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs all that serious</p>

        <p>First of all, OPs tweet (by a single nurse's with a clear agenda [look at her profile] personal experience) and the article I posted in response are both talking about the US. So I'm not sure why you think Canada is relevant.</p>
<p>Secondly, did you even read the articles in the link you sent me? The OP tries to tie two separate issues together and takes the extreme data from each end for the two different articles to try to piece together a narrative that's argued against in the very first source they posted.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I can't claim to be informed or pretend to know what's best to do. But please be careful trying to be informed by anonymous strangers disingenuously manipulating data in order to fit an explicit agenda (r/lockdownskepticism probably isn't the most unbiased community, to say the least). Lockdowns may not be the most effective solution, but encouraging their dismissal without even a basic understanding of what we're up against or an alternative offered to experts who can judge those solutions is irresponsible and naive.</p>

        <p>Hm true. As far as I know though, it is normal for hospitals to be running nearly full through flu season though. Hospitals can't waste their capacity and resources. Family I know have been to hospitals now and they've been ghost towns. Not true for everywhere I guess but it's odd anyhow. They laid of a bunch of staff in march, so if hospitals are struggling then we need more beds and more staff. In 2018 they were overwhelmed but they managed, now we're doing all of this because they might be overwhelmed? Considering the low death rate of 0.5% for the general population below 70, most cases just need rest. But that's just my thoughts, if hospitals will struggle then we invest in helping them.</p>

        <p>Good point. I guess in any large system there's gonna be inefficiency, but it could always be better. That bureaucracy makes reaction time super slow though, so precautions have to be taken based off of worst case scenarios. Better to be over-prepared than under, right? As that guy's article stated, they're still heavily encouraging people to not avoid getting treatment, but still got to do our best to minimize cases.</p>
<p>True, the low death rate makes for even gray area. I'm very glad I'm not the one to have to make these decisions.</p>

        <p>Same. About better to be over prepared than underprepared, this is true to a certain degree. But once you get into that overpreparing hurting innocent people as lockdowns do, you get into an dangerous area. Probably the best decision to make is to let individuals make their own decisions according to their needs, but it's a tricky area when it comes to a public service such as hospitals being affected.</p>

<p>HHS site, capacity for most of the country is low right now.</p>
<p>https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/texas-government-counting-every-covid-positive-hospital-case</p>
<p>Hospital network CEO interviewed:</p>
<p>&rt;The number of hospitalizations are "being misinterpreted," said Houston Methodist CEO Marc Boom,¬†"and, quite frankly, we‚Äôre concerned that there is a level of alarm in the community that is unwarranted right now."</p>
<p>&rt;"There is not a scenario, in my opinion, where the demand for our beds ... would eclipse our capability," he continued. "I cannot imagine that. I just cannot."</p>
<p>The media is a money making business.  Fear gets clicks.</p>
<p>The virus real but the panic is exaggerated.  Like using big percentages to scare people like 93% occupancy!!!! When 90+ ICU occupancy is normal and necessary for this time of year.</p>

        <p>It is a plandemic. The virus is real but the PCR tests being used for a purpose that they were not intended for according to the PERSON WHO INVENTED THEM, Mr. Mullis, is driving up the numbers.</p>
<p>PCR tests cannot differentiate between LIVE and DEAD viral material. Therefore, if you get near anyone who has been sick with CoVid-19 in the past and is recovered within 3-6 months after they recovered, you are likely to "TERST BLOSITIVE" on those tests because of that non-differentiation between live and dead viral material.</p>
<p>Absent a ANTIBODY TEST for this virus, they should NOT be calling anyone a 'case' outside of actual damned symptoms with the PCR test.</p>

        <p>No, there isn't. Numerous people have pointed out that PCR tests are INACCURATE and cannot differentiate between LIVE and DEAD viral material.</p>
<p>That means if you get near someone who has had CoVid-19 in the past 3-6 months and is still shedding DEAD viral material, which is perfectly normal and natural and DOES NOT GIVE YOU COVID-19... you can test positive even though you are not sick.</p>
<p>PCR tests are NOT antibody tests, Antibody tests are the PLATINUM standard... no... RHODIUM standard for diagnosis of "Yes, you have X flu!"</p>
<p>Kinda surprising we don't have that for this coronavirus when we have had it for EVERY SINGLE OTHER ONE for the past 30 years now!</p>

        <p>Now now, keep it civil, hate to see a moderator ban you because you can't control your emotions. Point 1: it isn't up to me to prove anything about al Qaeda not being involved, as its a conspiracy theory you support the burden of evidence is yours. Start with the 19 alleged hijackers, can you place all 19 at the 3 airports the 4 planes departed from with legal evidence? Now of course this is a ridiculous challenge as the hundreds and hundreds of cameras in each airport covering every  area will result in the ridiculous abundance of time and date stamped security images of these alleged hijackers at  the airports and boarding their planes. Can you do that or does your conspiracy theory rely on them being invisible or able to teleport? I'm sure you weren't gullible enough to buy into a conspiracy theory without trying to prove it without relying on propaganda or hearsay right? Show me</p>
<p>Point 2: have you read the NIST NCSTAR report? Its a very dry 10,000 pages. I find a lot of....individual like yourself scream and yell yet haven't even read the source they are supposed to defend. If you have youd be able to answer some very basic questions which all invariably lead to the debunking of the popular mechanics article. If not, you're really in no position to even have an opinion on something you're completely ignorant of correct? So do tell me you've read it and we can easily verify. </p>
<p>Point 3: what do I have to apologize for? You completely misread a comment of mine, made claims I had stated something I did not, got caught, then ban me for it. Not seeing where I owe an apology anywhere for that.</p>
