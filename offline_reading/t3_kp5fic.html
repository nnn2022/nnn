        <p>I know of a guy here in the states in SoCal who had to go to hospital because of a motorcycle accident. Everywhere he went he had to be escorted by security or someone, and he said that the hospital looked pretty empty.</p>

        <p>When you are a patient in a hospital you are always escorted anywhere you go, procedures, imaging, etc as the hospital is liable for anything that happens to you within its limit.  Before the pandemic, sometimes patient were allowed to go to the cafeteria or walking around the unit for exercise on their own, and even then they will have a nurse with you most of the time. Sounds pretty standard to me.</p>

        <p>shutting down all elective procedures has greatly emptied general medical beds making some part of the hospital looks empty, however this has only resulted in limited increase in availability of intensive care beds as you required  highly specialized staff that takes years to train and expensive equipment. For example in intensive care units your nurse to patient ration tends to be 2:1. Unfortunately if you get into a car accident and need intensive care after trauma surgery, you might end up with a undertrained staff filling in. Covid will not kill the young, but the scarcity of resources because of surge of covid will.</p>

        <p>Seems like we should have rehired all those furloughed staff or cross trained medics and GPs. Oh well lockdown forever it is.</p>
<p>Btw COVID patients don’t need highly specialized care, it’s basic stuff. Ventilators are also rarely used any longer.</p>

        <p>Yup, no need for highly specialized staff or equipment if you are a 40 something with mild

        <p>Cut the bullshit. People are not wanting to wear masks because they are bacteria magnets that even SURGEONS are refusing to wear for more than 30 minutes at a time well before this pandemic appeared because they get so cruddy with the air you are exhaling through them.</p>
<p>That is the reason why even TUBERCULOSIS patients who have the ANTIBOTIC RESISTANT version before now did not wear masks in hospitals on a regular basis.</p>

        <p>Surgeons refusing to wear masks for 30 minutes? During surgery? Never met any, you would be kicked out of resident on day one, even medschool. You just pulled that one out of thin air, the joint commission will shut down that hospital on the spot and fine them hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Mask are bacteria magnets? What are you talking about? Bacterias just fly propelled towards masks? They will certainly catch normal flora coming out of your own lungs, but becoming an infectious foco? What kind of bacteria are you talking about? Never met an OR or ED staff dying from facial bacteria magnets. Do you plan on using the same cloth mask non-stop for weeks through your sleep, damped from breath without washing it and frequently sucking on it in a mouth with multiple ulcerative bleeding lesions? What is this “mask are culture media situation”? Scrubing for surgery clearly reduces infection rates, and by clearly I mean we have decades long scientific evidence, maybe go on a google scholar research mission.
The TB resistant patients is just another staff pulled out of thin air. Patients refuse to wear masks bucease they find them uncomfortable. You can’t reinfect your own body with tuberculosis because your are wearing a mask. That’s not how mycobacterium works. The treatment takes 6 months to a year of daily medication. I have treated patients with Abx resistant TB, and they were using masks. They also lived in the community. They are asked to do so, and only considered noninfectious after repeated sputum cultures which reflect presence of TB in the respiratory tree. You are just making stuff up.</p>

        <p>While I agree about hospitals conflating the numbers and lying about being overwhelmed with patients I don't think photos of certain areas of a hospital or video of an empty lobby or hallways is evidence. The Covid cases would be in ICU wards or pneumonia wards that would be behind keycarded doors. Just to play devils advocate, we won't have definitive evidence until we see photos of the being the scenes areas</p>

        <p>Definitely they would. Italy scared the shit out of the world with images of overrun hospitals and body bags filling hallways. If North American hospitals were like that we'd be seeing it all over instead of Tik Tok dancing videos. I'd just like to see insider hidden camera content coming out from ICUs showing what's going on, maybe it'll better sway some more minds that are on the fence</p>
