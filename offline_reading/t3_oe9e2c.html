        <p>This is a lengthy article and I'm not sure i have fully digested it yet.  However, the way I read it, the primary risk happens when an infected individual receives the vaccine.  Because the virus has already had time to multiply, variants will inevitably exist. Only the variants resistant to the vaccine will survive...and then flourish.</p>
<p>However, there's no reason to think that the resulting variant would implicitly be more harmful to the host than the original.  There's a chance of a chance that could happen, but it doesn't sound very likely.</p>
<p>I believe the vast majority of new variants would only be "more deadly" because the already vaccinated people would be unprotected from the new variant.  Not because the new variant is more deadly than the original.</p>

        <p>Great finding! Here are some excerpts</p>
<p>&rt; Read and his colleagues are studying how the herpesvirus that causes Marek’s disease — a highly contagious, paralyzing and ultimately deadly ailment that costs the chicken industry more than $2 billion a year — might be evolving in response to its vaccine. Its latest vaccine, that is. Marek’s disease has been sickening chickens globally for over a century; birds catch it by inhaling dust laden with viral particles shed in other birds’ feathers. <strong>The first vaccine was introduced in 1970, when the disease was killing entire flocks. It worked well, but within a decade, the vaccine mysteriously began to fail; outbreaks of Marek’s began erupting in flocks of inoculated chickens. A second vaccine was licensed in 1983 in the hopes of solving the problem, yet it, too, gradually stopped working. Today, the poultry industry is on its third vaccine. It still works, but Read and others are concerned it might one day fail, too — and no fourth-line vaccine is waiting. Worse, in recent decades, the virus has become more deadly</strong></p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Most people have heard of antibiotic resistance. Vaccine resistance, not so much.</strong> That’s because drug resistance is a huge global problem that annually kills nearly 25,000 people in the United States and in Europe, and more than twice that many in India. <strong>Microbes resistant to vaccines, on the other hand, aren’t a major menace. Perhaps they never will be: Vaccine programs around the globe have been and continue to be immensely successful at preventing infections and saving lives.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; Recent research suggests, however, that <strong>some pathogen populations are adapting in ways that help them survive in a vaccinated world, and that these changes come about in a variety of ways. Just as the mammal population exploded after dinosaurs went extinct because a big niche opened up for them, some microbes have swept in to take the place of competitors eliminated by vaccines.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Immunization is also making once-rare or nonexistent genetic variants of pathogens more prevalent, presumably because vaccine-primed antibodies can’t as easily recognize and attack shape-shifters that look different from vaccine strains</strong>. And <strong>vaccines being developed against some of the world’s wilier pathogens — malaria, HIV, anthrax — are based on strategies that could, according to evolutionary models and lab experiments, encourage pathogens to become even more dangerous.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Evolutionary biologists aren’t surprised that this is happening. A vaccine is a novel selection pressure placed on a pathogen, and if the vaccine does not eradicate its target completely, then the remaining pathogens with the greatest fitness — those able to survive, somehow, in an immunized world — will become more common. “If you don’t have these pathogens evolving in response to vaccines,” said Paul Ewald, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Louisville, “then we really don’t understand natural selection.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Studies have since backed up this idea</strong>. In a 2014 paper published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers in Australia, led by the medical microbiologist Ruiting Lan at the University of New South Wales, collected and sequenced B. pertussis samples from 320 patients between 2008 and 2012. The percentage of bacteria that did not express pertactin, a protein targeted by the acellular vaccine, leapt from 5 percent in 2008 to 78 percent in 2012, which suggests that selection pressure from the vaccine was enabling pertactin-free strains to become more common. In the U.S., nearly all circulating viruses lack pertactin, <strong>according to a 2017 CDC paper. “I think pretty much everyone agrees pertussis strain variation is shaped by vaccination,”</strong> Lan said.</p>
<p>&rt; They and others have reported that while Prevnar 7 almost completely eliminated infections with the seven targeted serotypes, the other, rarer serotypes quickly swept in to take their place, including a serotype called 19A, which began causing a large proportion of serious pneumococcal infections. In response, in 2010, the U.S. introduced a new vaccine, Prevnar 13, which targets 19A and five additional serotypes. Previously unseen serotypes have again flourished in response. A 2017 paper in Pediatrics compared the situation to a high-stakes game of whack-a-mole. <strong>In essence, vaccination has completely restructured the pathogen population, twice.</strong></p>
<p>This debunks even further the idea that the unvaccinated are responsible for the new variants. If anything, massive covid vaccination could end up causing deadlier variants due to artificial selection.</p>
