        <p>This sub brings me the opposite feeling: it just shows how people are too skeptical to understand who to blame, and who to trust. </p>
<p>It's revolting to consider that this situation would've been handled much better if people actually obeyed the simple requirements of wearing masks, isolating and maintaining basic hygiene. </p>
<p>But no, many decided to ignore it, thinking covid is a hoax, masks are suffocating, health care workers are trying to manipulate us, etc. etc. This resulted in stricter guidelines being required for a much longer period of time (and I've even seen store owners thinking the government is wrong for not allowing them to be open in the middle of the worst phase of a pandemic, somehow they don't blame stupid customers who don't respect the most basic health requirements). </p>
<p>The truth is that there are two groups to be blamed: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The people who had enough information to understand the pandemic and how to reduce it, and instead chose not to. They somehow think graduated scientists from all over the world are untrustworthy, and trust absurdly less reputable sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irresponsible governments that don't know how to enforce basic pandemic rules, while also mismanaging the gradual reopening of small establishments. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This sub reminds me of how stupid some people can be, even on the face of so much information and explanations. The health care workers who studied years and sacrifice their lives on the front line are not some evil group of people trying to manipulate you, masks are not bringing any health issues to you unless you have severe breathing problems and the only reason this virus persists is because of idiots who thought it was nothing to worry about. </p>
<p>Lastly, why do you people think the quarantine is a scheme by the government to control its population? You really think doctors, nurses and biologists from all over the world (who spent years studying, and many times by themselves) would not question the quarantine in case there was no virus? You really think the entire world of health professionals agreed on manipulating the entire population with a hoax? If that's the case, then you massively misunderstand how much health professionals value the truth and their studies. And the truth is: there's a virus that has been killing people all over the world. You can check literally everywhere to see evidence for it.</p>
<p>But here's a true challenge for you: if you think it's not real, go to a hospital and say so. Ask them to take you to the patient's treatment room. Let them show you the truth. And how much you contributed to end those lives.</p>

        <p>Absolutely no one is to blame for a highly contagious virus spreading. That's just the nature of these viruses. Do you blame people, because they unknowingly infected someone with the flu? Think rational.</p>

        <p>Except we have people to blame ever since the beginning:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Meat on unsanitary conditions is more likely to have diseases that can affect humans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks vastly reduce the spread of the virus, and yet many people decided not to wear masks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolation is the biggest factor preventing contamination, and yet many people decided not to respect quarantine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some hospitals have lacked resources that could've been easily shipped to prevent deaths. </p>

<p>You people have no right to tell me to think rationally, since your arguments have no base whatsoever and your sources are untrustworthy and manipulative.

        <p>There's really no need for insults. I'm willing to have a civil discussion. I'm sure you are capable of that.</p>
<p>&rt;Masks vastly reduce the spread of the virus</p>
<p>So why were cases surging for months with masks mandates everywhere?</p>
<p>&rt;Isolation is the biggest factor preventing contamination</p>
<p>This I agree with, <em>IF</em> the person is sick and is actually showing symptoms. Isolating healthy people nonsensical and I shouldn't have to explain why.</p>
<p>&rt;your sources are untrustworthy and manipulative</p>
<p>So do you just agree with every other source that fits your narrative? I agree that some stuff posted here is straight misinfo, but some of it also isn't (I've seen multiple peer reviewed studies, etc.).</p>

        <p>Truth is, it's much easier for you to say so than it is for me to show trustful sources and explain why they can be believed. </p>
<p>As such, in the following 24 hours I'll link 10 different articles here, and I ask you to tell me why even one of those would be untrustworthy or manipulative. </p>
<p>Lastly, in the meantime, you yourself can find at least one peer reviewed article that is untrustworthy or manipulative and then show it to me. Don't forget to explain why it'd be so, and whether another article has already disproved it or not (in case it no longer holds factual information).</p>

<p>Before reading any of this, I must give you some further explanations. </p>
<p>Science is not about always being right. In fact, it's the opposite: we constantly make mistakes, but this adds up towards the truth. As such, certain results can be disproven in a constant process of finding, hypothesizing, experimenting, and analyzing results. What if you find out your hypothesis is false? Well, that's one step further from ignorance: now you can tell what's wrong. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As such, articles and scientific sources can indeed make mistakes. However, in this process, we can determine for further researches what is false or yet to be disproven. And this is the most important point: science won't reach a truth and solidify it as such. A much more important expression is ''truth above any suspicion'' (an interesting philosopher for this point is Karl Popper). How much stuff is mostly standard knowledge today, and yet was not believed at all in earlier centuries? Genetics, evolution and relativity come to mind. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Every time a certain line of truth is disproven, we can tell a break of paradigm occurs. As such, before Mendel's pea experiments were made, there was a paradigm. After his findings were considered, the scientific community found itself at another paradigm, creating the branch of genetics. However, just because what they called ''true'' was disproven, it doesn't mean we can simply dismiss science itself. After all, to this day, many theories (commonly accepted and verified hypotheses) still haven't been disproven, and have helped us improve society as a whole. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In conclusion, it's important to always be critical of what you read. However, it's also essential to understand how some theories have decades of research alongside countless unsuccessful attempts to disprove them. Doesn't mean they'll always be right, it just means that, for now, they can still be held as true. Scientists value this a lot, so they spend a lot of time checking sources, reading the papers, etc. And truth is, not always they'll avoid lies. It's hard not to fall for a lie, but the odds vastly decrease the more someone reads a paper, replicates the experiment, etc. I'd recommend going by big journals and overall many sites that go after trustful (or untrustful, in case you want to avoid them) sources. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lastly, I must apologize for being so arrogant in some comments, since the barrier between the scientific community and the general population is created mostly by arrogance.</p>
