        <p>I got banned there too for this comment referring to the mandatory mask law on transit there:</p>
<p>&rt;not inconsiderate, I consider it inconsiderate to try to force me to wear a mask and take away services that my tax dollars helped pay for
&rt;
&rt;I will not comply, I am being forced to drive my vehicle every day and pollute the air, because I will not get on the transit system anymore until they get rid of this mandatory mask policy</p>
<p>They also permanently banned me, and they won't admit which one of them did the banning, when I messaged the mods asking about the ban they muted me immediately, so I have no idea if it was /u/oilernut or /u/soupyhands or /u/OGDinosaur or /u/frost92  as there is no way to find out or have a rational discussion about the unfairness of such a permanent ban over a sincere comment that I made that should never be censored, let alone banned for</p>
<p>and you wonder why reddit becomes a circle jerk of same hysterical opinions when they silence anyone that questions the insanity...... media and social media in general in North America are turning into a horrible repressive force spreading an agenda and destroying any individual who stands up for truth</p>

        <p>Wow disgusting. All of those users suck. I didn’t know they were mods but it explains a lot.</p>
<p>They’re all just much comfier in their echo chambers of how great and holier than thou they all are because they’re compliant and saving elderly people’s lives (apparently.)</p>
<p>I didn’t even message them about it. I’m surprised it took this long tbh. I’ve been speaking out against those dumbass comments since March.</p>

        <p>messaging them is futile, they will just mute you, they treat the subreddit as their own personal playground where they have the full power and make the rules up as they go along, it is sad that it kind of seems to casual readers and visitors to be an "official voice" for our city, when it is far from being an open discourse</p>
<p>I really worry for the future, because social media in general is moving towards this kind of single-minded, "no disagreement allowed" force in society, and media in general is being used to influence and mold public opinion.  My mother watches CNN and CBC and other mainstream media and she is absolutely terrified of covid as she believes everything they spout at her 24/7 (she also hates Trump and thinks he is evil incarnate, because they told her that every day since he came into office, it is accepted "truth" now that he killed hundreds of thousands of people with his ideas on covid and "he locked babies in cages", etc... )</p>
<p>the world is fucked, it is 2020 and the intelligent independent thinkers are becoming more rare, and are being silenced, I really don't see it getting better in the future, it is sad</p>
