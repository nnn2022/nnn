        <p>Sources like FDA and CDC and even clinical publications really beat around the bush when it comes to viral vector technology, and they can throw a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo onto it, to deter any unwanted visitors, but the simple fact remains:</p>
<p>A viral vector vaccine is a vaccine that contains a genome, that is modified (recombinant) to include genes to code for a protein. If the genome is DNA (ds-DNA means double-stranded DNA), then this DNA HAS TO BE DELIVERED INTO THE CELL NUCLEUS in order for proteins to be created. The process is DNA-&rt;transcription to RNA in the cell nucleus--&rt;transport of RNA to the cell plasma, where RNA is moved to ribosomes on the mitochondrion, where the RNA code will be used to make a protein out of amino acids.</p>
<p>So, DNA has to be present in the cell nucleus for this to work. If you have mRNA vaccines, like Pfizer and ModeRNA, they skip the DNA step, and just remain in the cell plasma where the ribosomes are. However, AZ/J&amp;J and sputnik deliver their DNA right in the spot where your own genome resides: the cell nucleus.</p>
<p>You can see how the CDC is clearly hiding this information from us, by using the most vague wording possible: <strong><em>"COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions (????) for our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the “spike protein.”</em></strong></p>
<p>What they are hiding here, is that the <strong><em>instructions</em></strong> <strong>in reality means genetic code,</strong> aka DNA. Many people would not sign up for these vaccines if they knew what kind of invasive technology is being used. Adenovirus and adeno-associated vectors are used in officially listed gene-therapy, it really is the same technology platform that these vaccines use.</p>
<p><strong>AstraZeneca.</strong></p>
<p><em>"Adenoviruses such as AZD1222 are non-encapsulated, icosahedral particles (virions) between 80 and 100 nm in diameter.</em> <strong><em>The particles contain a single copy of the double-stranded DNA genome."</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>J&amp;J</strong></p>
<p><em>"Wild-type adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) consists of non-enveloped virions, which encode the adenoviral proteins.</em> <strong><em>The dsDNA molecule is encapsulated</em></strong> <em>by an icosahedral protein structure.</em></p>
<p><em>The recombinant Ad26 vector Ad26.COV2.S contains a</em> <strong><em>transgene</em></strong> <em>which encodes a modified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein"</em></p>

        <p>Yeah, there have definitely been shills in here under the guise of nonewnormalers pushing the "traditional" vaccines.</p>
