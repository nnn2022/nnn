    <strong>Are the people on r/Coronavirus bots or are they insane?</strong>
    <p><p>I went on there today and it’s quite scary how eager they are for more draconian measures. I saw one say “I’d honestly be hopeful that they will still force wearing masks on planes” and things like “Two weeks after my second shot I can finally get a haircut, go to the grocery store for myself, and see my friends for the first time in a year.” </p>
<p>Newsflash: You’ve been able to do these things the whole time. If you feel so inclined; wear 5 masks on a plane. I don’t care. But why do they seem eager for authoritarianism? It’s the weirdest thing to me.</p></p>

        <p>Boris Johnson’s lockdown measure have sounded insane from this side of the pond and I got upvoted for saying so but the comments indicated all these people thought I was saying his measures were too lax and/or didn’t last long enough. Anyone else see the daily “clap for the NHS” thing they were doing? I saw some people tweeting that they were keeping track of which of their neighbors weren’t participating. Frankly it’s the creepiest thing I’ve seen yet. Beyond COVID Karens saying you going maskless is putting them in danger, this is USSR thought-police-level scary.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately modern America has clearly defined “wrongthink” and a mob of people are willing to crucify anyone who says the wrong things or feels that they are unjustified in their social justice witch-hunt. As cynical as it is, people disappoint me so much nowadays that I stick to the 3-4 solid people I know and my family. I have no interest in or patience for dealing with crazy anymore, and that’s one thing I’ve gotten from 2020.</p>

        <p>But can you imagine getting harassed even though you never said anything wrong and followed all the ludicrous requirements, all you did was not outwardly support it to their satisfaction? Actually come to think of it I have seen this sort of thing from the “silence is violence” BLM crowd.</p>

        <p>Yeah. It’s eerily similar to what you said in the Soviet Union of the 20th century, and even modern China or North Korea. Not pledging fealty to “the party” equates to social suicide. It’s baffling that people don’t see it. The governments of the world have been saying THIS WILL NEVER END since around April/May of 2020 and nobody batted an eye. And look where we are. Suicides, alcoholism, domestic violence, crippling mental illness, an entire generation robbed of a year of their lives. For what? To avoid risking a flu variant that killed .003 percent of the people who got it. Was it worth it? Now various states and countries even are opening for business only to face ridicule and public shame. Where I’m at (stuck) in California I truly believe that this absurd lockdown will not end until well into 2022 and we’ll all be so shellshocked by it at that point that it will be an odd feeling even eating in public. It’s a shame</p>

        <p>One of the worst parts in my opinion is that this almost exclusively kills the very old. What kind of society sacrifices the young to protect the old? I have no doubt that these lockdowns will cause a far greater loss in person-years than the actual virus, both deaths from despair and delayed treatment and screenings for other (more serious) diseases, like cancer. I was so shocked when they initially closed the infusion clinic at the local cancer hospital because of COVID. Those people are there for chemotherapy, I know they’re immune compromised but they’ll literally die (or die in even worse pain) if they miss their treatments. And the lockdown fanatics are just so blasé about the effect of the school closures. Our public schools already suck and our kids are behind compared to most of the developed world, the teachers unions saying “oh, kids are resilient, they’ll be able to catch up no problem” just proves those unions do not give a crap about the kids, and the teachers aren’t exactly rising up and demanding a return to in-person learning. Honestly this whole pandemic has seriously lowered my opinion of public school teachers. Selflessly serving the children my ass.</p>
