        <p>A bit. I was incredibly anti-firearm, pro-gun control, like the majority of people here and in the rest of Europe. I've always thought the US laws on guns were one of the craziest things about the country. On the one hand, I guess being armed might have some pro's if we continue down this path. On the other hand, our police are not armed and whilst they have been getting heavy handed at protests, they are not shooting us.  Honestly, I don't really think being armed will make any difference when people that think like us are a tiny % of the population and we are up against not only the full apparatus of the state, but 99% of our own citizens who don't even want to fight for freedom.  If that tide turns, then the unarmed police won't be able to stop it, and if they sent the military, well, we'd be fucked if they choose to fight against us, armed or not, a few handguns makes no difference when they send tanks. </p>
<p>I am glad that those 99% and the police in my country are unarmed, so overall, I think I'm still pro-gun control.  Tbh, the most likely person I would shoot would be myself anyway, so it's probably better for me.</p>

        <p>Very few criminals in my country are armed with fire arms, some carry knives, but it's incredibly rare for someone to have a gun.  The only time I've ever seen a gun is in the hands of a special anti-terrorist police unit at an airport.  Oh, and in a firing range I went to in Nevada! </p>
<p>That's absolutely all good and you do what you gotta do, but if you have guns, they have guns and it makes the likelihood of a lethal outcome way higher than a scenario where neither of you have guns.  I might be tempted to own a firearm as well in a scenario where the majority of criminals carried guns, or even if the police carried guns.</p>

        <p>I would have to Respectfully disagree, Having lived in Italy in the 80's, Criminals do have guns, they are just classed as Terrorists when they do. I was there for the Rome Airport Massacre, another at just an intersection, 2 Restaurant Bombings, and my Generals car was blown up in Germany, thankfully I only Chauffeured him in Italy. In all of that I was shot twice, but here in the US where almost everyone owns a gun, I have never been shot.</p>

        <p>I dunno anything about Italy in the 80s, I'm talking about the UK now. It is incredibly rare for criminals to carry guns. I'm not saying zero criminals carry guns, but so few carry guns that it is not a concern an average British citizen has.  My main point here is that if everyone carries guns, it forces an escalating arms race in that everyone then needs to carry for defense, and that leads to more negative outcomes for everyone.  That isn't to say there can't be positive things from carrying fire arms, but that you have to accept the negatives of that as well. I prefer that our police do not carry fire arms and are (meant to) police by consent, resulting in less abuses of police power and far less people killed by police than a country in which everyone carries guns. We have special highly trained police units to deal with terrorist incidents - the last time that happened in London Bridge, a man wielding a machete was shot dead within 8 minutes, before he could seriously injure anyone else.  Even the terrorists here struggle to get hold of fire arms and it's normally machetes or homemade bombs that have been used in the last 20 years when we have had incidents. </p>
<p>With all due respect, your experience does not sound like one of the average citizen, or you have been incredibly unlucky to be involved in multiple terrorist related events. 99.99% of people will not ever be involved in a single incident like you have described.  I have travelled all over the world for work and pleasure and have never been shot, but my anecdote is no more proof of anything than yours is.</p>

        <p>I can see n respect your point of unarmed, n ideologically it is a beautiful world, but I would argue that the very fact the technology exists, that utopia can never be achieved. I can't speak much of England as I mostly only know how to get lost in your Airport. But I am glad it is good for you. </p>
<p>In Italy, in my time, the Polizia were armed with hand guns while the special police the Carabinieri were armed with automatics. The main problem of Terrorism came from Libya and Syria. Citizens were for the large part were unarmed, as were all of us, American TTY Military. </p>
<p>In both shootings, both Police forces vanished and it was us unarmed US Air Force that took out the Terrorists. Simply, it is what we were trained to do. I got shot, friends died, a lot of people died that didn't need to die. </p>
<p>Yes we all live different lives, yours sounds rather nice, mine has had it's good sides too.</p>

        <p>Yea, police in other countries do carry guns. I personally believe that if citizens cannot carry fire arms, police should not be able to either, as police are citizens. Don't get me wrong, the fire arms situation is about the only thing I agree with in the UK, it is turning into a dystopian hellscape and I'll probably leave eventually.  It sucks that you were involved in those incidents but I'm glad things have improved for you.</p>
<p>Edit:  According to Wikipedia, the terrorists involved in the Rome Airport shooting in 1985 were killed by Israeli airport security (3 of them) and Italian police (1 of them), with a further 3 captured by local police. It doesn't mention unarmed US Air Force at all so I'm really not sure I believe you.  Only looked it up because I was interested how a bunch of unarmed military took out armed terrorists.</p>

        <p>&rt;No, the  Carabinieri  ran n hid like the cowards they are, n there were only 3 Terrorists, there were no 3 that got away. (Since when do Terrorists run away) They opened up on everyone with machine guns in the worst blood bath I have ever saw in my life. Didn't know the news said otherwise, sad, I believed the news more back then.  Regardless, believe what u like, I don't care. I know the truth.</p>

        <p>Question. Are you allowed self defense weapons of any kind where you are ? Knives, mace, etc ?</p>
<p>It definitely seems "out there" to many people I've talked to outside of the US that we can literally go down to the farm and feed to buy a rifle, handgun, and a few knives hut it's just very normal to us.
They also picture people walking around the streets strapped down and terrified which simply isn't true. Yes, lots of us carry guns or other weapons regularly, or just have a bunch of them at home.. but it's such a cultural collection type thing that also happen to second as deadly weapons - many times for hunting.</p>

        <p>I actually don't know, the law on knives is we can't carry them above a certain length. I guess how it looks to other countries is even if you aren't terrified, you are thinking that you may need to defend yourself.  You might call it collecting, but people collect all kinds of things and don't feel the need to carry those collections around with them. I have never once left my house in my home country thinking I would need any weapon or even being vaguely concerned I would need to defend myself physically in any way.  So far I have never needed to either. </p>
<p>So yea, I guess it does just seem paranoid, but then also could that not be a product of knowing criminals are also carrying guns? If that was the case here, maybe I would be more paranoid and feel the need to carry as well.  I've gotta say, I feel a large part of the gun culture thing in the US has nothing to do with the pros or cons of gun control and more to do with guns being fun to shoot. Which I can agree with, I went to a firing range in Nevada and shot all kinds of guns up to ARs and it was really fun.</p>

        <p>In the US between the election, civil unrest, and covid we sold 28.8 million guns as of the end of September. In all of 2019 there were only 28.4 million new guns sold for the whole year. And the majority are new gun owners who've neve owned one.  Don't quote me but I beleive I heard 9 million of those are new gun owners who've never owned one before</p>

        <p>There's no guarantee that in the event of civil unrest, many of those guns won't be pointed at you rather than the enemy.  So I dunno if that's a good thing or not, millions of people panicking about a deadly virus who already get enraged at the sight of an unmasked face carrying guns around doesn't seem like a good thing to me.</p>

        <p>Meh even if this is all true I'd say the majority of those 9 million new owners <em>know</em> gun owners already and are being guided and taught. They may be buying them out of fear but they can't do anything with them if they don't know how to use them, in the event their worst fears come true.</p>

        <p>As the rumor mill spreads about Covid camps popping up up there.</p>
<p>I honestly can't see how the US could ever even strongly attempt to ban guns from us down here. There's just too many of them. The majority of people I know own guns and none of them have just one gun.</p>

        <p>And it should stay that way. The government is not to be trusted and without weapons you are defenceless.</p>
<p>Proof? You just talked about the Covid camps in Canada. Not only is it a rumour , there’s a video of that very idea being questioned in the parliament. The individual who asked the question was given a non answer, and when he asked to clarify, he was asked to sit down and they cut his mic. 
It’s terrifying and I don’t know what’s about to happen to us here in Canada.</p>

<p>I saw a comment on that video that said anyone who sees these camps being built have a civic duty to burn it to the group. I can't say I disagree.</p>
<p>How do people not freaking SEE what is happening ?</p>

        <p>Left wing Canadian.....That’ll be a no from me dawg. Though I have moved culturally closer to redhats on other culture war items though. I’m very glad my country doesn’t have ubiquitous gun ownership given how tense everyone is.</p>
<p>I’d consider myself very anti cancel culture and anti SJW after all this. I also think the label “anti-science” has lost all meaning. And although I think climate change is a very important, I don’t think bourgeois American liberalism has any real solutions for it given they started stanning for suburban car oriented lifestyles through all of this.</p>
<p>Can I ask you redhat Americans, has the authoritarianism made you somewhat less trusting of police?</p>

        <p>Honestly most of the people they claim are police loving bootlickers have absolutely never trusted the government or authority at all. We're raised to side eye it, question it, and fight to keep it out of our homes and lives as much as humanly possible.</p>
<p>I truly don't know where the wires were crossed into making everyone believe the more conservative side loves authority. They never have. </p>
<p>I think what they get "caught" on is the calls for violence against any random ass officer that may be walking down the street because ya know, that's wrong.. so they want to show officers they don't hate them for existing and that comes off to some as "bootlicking" because we aren't up to physically assault someone we don't like just because we don't like them.</p>

        <p>The authority comes from the legislature and the prosecutors, not the police. It's your job to hold your elected officials accountable. The laws that police enforce are determined by the legislature, and how they're enforced is determined by prosecutors, both of whom are elected. There are bad officers and departments, but the blame lies elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Canadian here. Regardless if having a gun or not, if I used force to defends myself if I were forced to wear mask or to go to an isolation camp, I would be branded as a conspiracy theorist and a danger to society, both in terms of being able to make people sick, or physically hurting them.</p>

<p>I still support gun controls where people have to be legal adults, get mental health check, go to courses and provide reasons for why they use guns - hunting, work or sport. Different purposes needs different types of guns.</p>
<p>The control make it less likely for people with certain mental health conditions and untrained people getting access to them.</p>
