        <p>I think it's a lot of ego and sunken cost fallacy not letting them admit that they were wrong. I knew it would be like this the second we shut down because viruses follow a natural curve, it was obviously spreading worldwide since at least January, and shutting everything down would only prolong the curve (as was the initial "two week" plan). But everyone bought in so hard it's hard for them to admit that the models were wrong and the logic was tragically flawed from the get go.</p>

        <p>It's so absurdly and enragingly stupid. They actually believe that the reason the virus didn't disappear is because "everyone else is such a selfish idiot not following the rules". Where does this dumb bullshit notion come from? Who's not following the stupid rules? We've been forced to play along in this moronic charade for over five months now. You can't go anywhere without a stupid masks and other quack measures like "social distancing" and being reminded that "we're in the middle of a deadly pandemic" every 20 seconds. Businesses, other public places and events have been decimated. The world has literally become a dystopian nightmare, and these covinazis still somehow believe that they are heroes for doing what they're told and there exists this huge portion of the population that can just exist outside of this horrible dystopian hell they've created and live our lives like we were living last year? Maybe just maybe...the reason the virus hasn't gone away is because you cannot eradicate, contain or slow down a virus with a low IFR and high R0. It's so painfully obvious that all these measures are completely useless, and horribly detrimental. But nope...they can't come to this obvious and indisputable conclusion. It requires an understanding of actual science, as well as basic logic and common sense, something these people clearly lack. So they just keep screaming this dumb shit all day and night about "people not taking it seriously and following the rules". What a sick sad society when you find out that most of the population never made it mentally past preschool. This year has sure taught me a lot about how hopelessly (and sickeningly) stupid most people are. We are in this nightmare because of this.</p>

        <p>Fuck this person and fuck every other brain-damaged dickhead who perpetuates this "we're never going back" fear-mongering horse shit narrative.  </p>
<p>The virus <em>will</em> fade away eventually and become low-level background noise for which easy treatment exists, and it's becoming increasingly clear that this is going to happen sooner than we initially thought.  The fact that people want this soulless, joyless, inhumane state of being to drag out beyond the end of the pandemic proves that it is about something other than disease mitigation.</p>

<p>I mean you're probably completely right. But with all the weirdness and confusion that surrounds the possible vaccine right now I'm not sure I'm very eager to just go get any injection that is being marketed as a cure either. I want life to return to normal a lot. But if the treatment is a vaccine that is hardly tested I'm not sure how much I would enjoy that.</p>

        <p>I'm not talking about a vaccine, I'm talking about stuff you take once you're already sick, to ease symptoms.  Like Z-pak, Remdesivir, etc.  My neighbor was sick in late April and her doctor gave her steroids among other things which she said seemed to help.  I don't want to go down the HCQ rabbit hole but there's that too for whatever it's worth.  Also, doctors figuring out what <em>not</em> to do (ie realizing that vents were killing people)</p>
<p>The problem with treatment is that so much of it is surrounded by politics for whatever reason and that gets in the way of just figuring out what actually fucking works.  But they're getting there and I think it's only a matter of time before they come up with something that is definitively proven to ease symptoms.</p>
<p>Whatever is the first vaccine to make it to market is almost guaranteed to be completely useless.  I'm not holding my breath for a vaxx to ever be a viable solution.</p>
