    <strong>My experience as a teacher (and why I partly quit my last job)</strong>
    <p><p>My first day on the job (March 31), teachers excitedly walked in and exclaimed they all were vaccinated! Interestingly, nearly everyone had to take off for many days due to intense sickness. Only two of us were not vaccinated and did not plan to. Our option? We had to do actual weekly spit tests and send to the government. Seriously.</p>
<p>To go deeper, I had to go on a live Zoom call and show them I was spitting into a cup.</p>
<p>This really bothered me. It felt gross. Also, it was taking away from my class time.</p>
<p>Now, that was not the only reason I quit. This school was modeled after pure communist principles. I do not care what your political beliefs are here, but it was truly eye opening:</p>
<p>1) Almost no breaks. Work yourself to death. Also, come in early and leave late. And feel guilty if you do not.</p>
<p>2) Kids were NOT allowed to move out of their seats, accept for lunch and breaks. Teachers switched between classes. Kids were miserable.</p>
<p>3) If I even pulled down my mask for one second, someone would ultimately yell at me. It was scary. </p>
<p>4) Snitches everywhere. The teachers were always watching and reporting to the boss. I told a kid he may have had a hard life, and they reported me for being racist.</p>
<p>5) No decorations, no beauty allowed.</p>
<p>6) Complete loyalty to the boss - no questioning! </p>
<p>7) Not allowed to sit down while working.</p>
<p>8) Nobody was friendly with each other. Everyone was miserable.</p>
<p>9) The boss was "anti-fun." I tried to come up with rewards and incentives and all were disregarded.</p>
<p>10) My final straw is when I had worked 14 hours and they made me feel guilty for going home to my baby. Anti-family.</p>
<p>Now, besides all that - the Covid 19 mandates for schools were so useless and expensive. All the money spent to "protect" children could have been used to actually...I don't know..educate them?</p>
<p>Right now I have a job lined up in a more rural area. I feel the mandates will be less harsh (though still need to be followed). It won't be perfect, but if that school is any reflection of where this country is headed, I'm scared.</p>
<p>Edit: someone noted this sounds more like Fascism. I agree.</p></p>

        <p>What they are doing to the kids is criminal, and dystopian as hell. 7 hours in a chair with only half an hour out and maybe 5 minute bathroom breaks,most adults couldn't do that! I knew they did away with recess years ago.</p>

        <p>Good for you for quitting.
My third grader hated distance learning, and decided to try in person when it became an option. He lasted two weeks before breaking down in tears. He hated the mask, the sanitizer, the fact that all special classes (music, science, PE) had been taken away. They had one ball at “recess” and rules about distance and touching. 
I brought him back home for distance learning. 
The poor teacher had a class split between distance and in-person. She worked hours on end and even delivered worksheets to our homes. 
I have no idea what the fall holds for us, but I am trying to find a home school option.

        <p>There are many options for homeschooling, of course, but my child and I were happy with a US company called Bridgeway Academy. We elected to use physical textbooks and did all the classwork offline.
Good luck to you and your son!</p>

        <p>I leave this info anywhere I see people needing help:</p>
<p>https://hslda.org/</p>
<p>Homeschool Legal Defense Association has tons of info on curriculum choices, how to HS as a single parent, etc. </p>
<p>Plus, if you join, you get free legal help in case the school district tries to harass you about homeschooling.</p>
<p>Also reach out to your local homeschool groups, the families there have always been a blessing to connect with. Not every group is religious if that is a concern.</p>

        <p>Communism and fascist are practically the same thing in practice. The slight differences are irrelevant compared to the total authoritarian nature of both systems. 
Liberty is the only solution. Too bad Americans have been brainwashed into fearing and even actively opposing liberty.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that. We live a very rural area and my wife is a former teacher at the school that she went to as a kid (even worked with some teachers that taught her) but she ended up quitting due to a new superintendent that didn't see eye to eye with her (workplace politics like anywhere else). </p>
<p>I can't even imagine what it would be like to live in, much less teach in a city. I hope you have better luck the further away you get from cities. I don't know what it's like in your area but in mine we tend to keep to ourselves and don't bother anyone. Best of luck!</p>

        <p>Thanks! I think the cities will be hit the hardest. I'm not really sure. Education is in the process of destruction.</p>

        <p>The teachers nowadays should just take the next step and point corrective tools at the children if they don't smile for the camera. I mean why not and make orange uniforms mandatory if you catch my drift.</p>

        <p>Seriously, this is all the parents fault. If they paid more attention to what was really going on with their children while at school, instead of just looking at it as free baby sitting, then they should protest, rally together to stop this bs and if they can’t make the school administration change then pull their kids out permanently.  If I had kids there would be NO WAY they would be in the public school system and even most private schools just for these reasons; they are all run by psycho liberals.</p>
