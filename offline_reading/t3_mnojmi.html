    <strong>Who the rule followers are</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like the people who actually follow all/most of the rules- Always wearing (often 2) masks, seeing few people outside their house- are the people who prefer that lifestyle and whose financial position makes it easier. “Privileged” people in other words.</p>
<p>I work full time manual labor, and I am a very very social person. Am also single and looking to meet new people, which hard when that’s basically illegal lol. This year has fuckin sucked for me. I NEED to interact with people for my mental health- if I followed all the rules this year I’d likely be pretty damn depressed. As it is I am pretty goddamn anxious from evaluating the Covid comfort levels of all the people I interact with and worrying about what people who think about my behavior. And when I’m inside at work wearing the mask all day SUCKS. </p>
<p>My roommate is super liberal, very quiet, and does school mostly online. He enjoys his alone time, although he occasionally goes on a walk with friends. Legit the only person he has been in contact with the whole year is his girlfriend. He’s never had to wear a mask the whole day for work so he doesn’t get how annoying it is. And he gets mad at me for seeing the relatively few people I see, and complains how our (liberal) state is reopening to fast. (It’s really not)</p>
<p>My point is I think the people who are in favor of new normal are the people privileged enough that this live style suits them. The introverts. Couples. People who can work/school from home and therefore don’t even realize how annoying masks are. Who can have good mental health even without seeing friends </p>
<p>Real working people who go out in the world r done w this bullshit </p>
<p>I’d like to try this “privilege” argument out on an SJW sometime soon lol</p></p>

        <p>They want to kill you or at least stop you from procreating. Soon robots will do the labor. And the less dregs being eyesores in the streets the better. Like I'm pretty sure your fashion sense sucks.</p>
<p>Privilige only works for thinsg you can't change, such as skin color and sexuality. Things like income are your own fault (unless you're a proper minority of course, then you should totally complain!)</p>
