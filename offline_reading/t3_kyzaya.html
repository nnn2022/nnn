        <p>His post was a bit rash but he's just talking about how people are against masks but the masks aren't what caused those bad things to happen to you. It wasn't your fault either, it was due to the lack of support. This was the time for all us to come together and help each other out so we can get through this madness. Society deserves a safety net for when these abnormal events happen, especially when it was completely out of our control. I'm sorry that the establishment failed you and the times you are going through.</p>

        <p>Look, I get it. I don't think this is the best method, I agree with you. I don't think your financial situation should be allowed to change due to circumstances like this. The OP was focusing only on the people that are anti-mask. </p>

<p>Look up at the sub.  "NoNewNornal".  People are called "anti-maskers" because it minimizes them.  </p>
<p>"Ooooh it's just a little piece of fabric! Why are you demonstrators so selfish!"</p>
<p>Fuck that. Most people here would agree it's MUCH more than "just a mask".  It's like me saying that gay marriage is "Just about a little piece of paper!"</p>
<p>&rt;It's sad but what are the lockdown regulations you are experiencing?</p>
<p>Nothing is allowed to open except grocery stores and essentials. Curbside pickup for everything. No dining. No meeting other households unless you live alone. No going outside in groups of more than 5.</p>
<p>&rt;Are places like national parks open? Somewhere your grandparents could go to change up the monotony</p>
<p>You arent allowed to just "walk around". You are allowed to <em>exercise</em> outside near your home. The police are doing checks. </p>
<p>&rt; It's terribly sad for the elderly and I hope we see cases start to drop soon.</p>
<p>Cases will start to go down in a few months as virus season ends. <em>Just like magic</em>.</p>
<p>And we will be left with dozens of stories of hospitals that were "just about" to overflow, but never did.</p>

        <p>The lockdown is killing people.</p>
<p>I have a lot of contact with seniors.  They have been locked up, their activities have been cancelled, they are isolated, depressed and some of them don't even understand what is happening to them. Their mental conditions are deteriorating. Their friends are dying and they don't get to go to the funerals. Thier families are going through incredible hardships. They are suffering from depression and many other issues.</p>
<p>And <em>that just makes people unhealthy</em>.  And when you are already 78yrs old, and you don't see a lot of joy in life, you give up the will to keep waking up.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is what this ridiculous "rolling lockdown" BS is doing.</p>
<p>Every senior who has 1 year left to live, or 2 or 3, is losing the most precious thing .. &rt;time&lt; .. in the name of "keeping them safe" from harm".  And nobody asked them or consulted them on this.</p>
<p>And then of course we have all the other stuff. Global starvation. Missed medical procedures.  Suicides from depression. etc etc etc.</p>
<p>So of course you can have your opinion. But please don't think that your position is "victimless".</p>

        <p>I am simply discussing mask wearing policies. I have already said before that I can definitely agree with some of what you are saying about lockdowns.</p>

        <p>All the more reason for you to want to do everything you can to get through this pandemic properly. Would you prefer to have them isolated and dying in a hospital? You seriously just blame policy makers, scientist, and those trying to evolve for a tragedy caused by illness? Tragedy happens and those who are competent have a better chance at survival. Blaming the things that are in place to prevent greater tragedy is foolish and will keep you at the bottom. Don't think for a second that you're the only one that has suffered from this. I lost my career, had to move, have lost connection with everyone I know, lost ALL of my family (literally no fucking family), so we can have a pissing contest but I don't waste my time that way. My situation has changed due to hard work, competence, and a tiny bit luck. Life is a struggle unless you make an effort to understand it.</p>

<li>May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</li>
<li>A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</li>
<li>A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medince found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</li>
<li>A May 2020 cross-country study by the University of East Anglia (preprint) found that a mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf</li>
<li>An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</li>
<li>An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</li>
<li>An April 2020 Cochrane review (preprint) found that face masks didn’t reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2</li>
<li>An April 2020 review by the Norwich School of Medicine (preprint) found that “the evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks”, but supports the use of masks by “particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.” https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1</li>
<li>A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</li>
<li>An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591</li>
