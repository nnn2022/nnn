    <strong>Don't call them vaccines, they're Emergency Countermeasures.</strong>
    <p><p>That's why they're not eligible for the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/faq">Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a>, which compensates people injured or killed by vaccines. The VICP is a great program because it approves &rt; 70% of all claims, it compensates you for medical expenses / lost wages / pain &amp; suffering, it pays out $250 million+ every year, allows 3 years to file your claim, and lets you recoup your legal fees (including expert witnesses). </p>
<p>Since COVID countermeasures aren't eligible for the VICP, you have to apply for compensation through the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/cicp">Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program</a>. The CICP is a steaming pile of shit. It rejects 95% of claims, has barely paid out anything over the entire life of the program, only gives you 6 months to file a claim, and most importantly <strong>it does not allow you recoup any legal expenses.</strong> That last part is extremely important because it means nobody will help you with your claim. Vaccine injury cases are notoriously difficult to prove, and no lawyer will waste their time trying to help you navigate all the hurdles of the CICP knowing there's a 95% rejection rate and they can't recover their fees.</p>
<p>In other words: If you're seriously injured by a COVID countermeasure, <strong>you're fucked</strong>. The government won't pay for your ambulance ride, they won't pay your ER or hospital bills, they won't pay for the wages you lost while you were recovering. They'll probably tell you "it wasn't the vaccine, it was just a coincidence!" or "all those symptoms are just in your head".</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention the fact that <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/nyc-bar-scene-roars-back-monday-kicking-off-key-reopening-week-big-nj-news-due/3032296/">the emergency is over</a>? So why the fuck are we still using Emergency Countermeasures?</p></p>
