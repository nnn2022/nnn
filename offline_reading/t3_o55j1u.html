    <strong>Seeing the after effects of government lockdowns and restrictions</strong>
    <p><p>I've been on a road trip all week and today on my seven hour drive towards home, I came across a small hole-in-the-wall diner off the highway. It looked a little run down but I was in the middle of nowhere and needed something to eat on my seven hour drive, so I put a mask on and went in. My God, these people were miserable. This is what the government did to these people, and so many other people. They were living outside the diner in a trailer in the middle of nowhere. This restaurant had no paper products aside from napkins and paper food trays as to-go "boxes". They were trying so hard to be accommodating to their few customers. The food wasn't bad but I was pretty grossed out by the lack of cleanliness. I took the leftovers to go because I wasn't going to waste any of their food when they're struggling so hard. They couldn't serve certain meals on their menu because they weren't able to afford that because of covid. The waiter told me he couldn't give me a straw because they had none but if I wanted my drink to go he had a foam cup and I told him not to worry about it. I wasn't about to take anymore of their resources. I left as much as I could afford for a tip. </p>
<p>I learned that sometimes its not about "proving a point". Sometimes its just about supporting people who desperately need it, and if I have to wear a mask in a place where one idiot's report could put them under for good, and destroy their lives, I will happily wear it for them while raising a huge middle finger to the government that mercilessly crushed them under its thumb. I have a feeling I came across that place for a reason. Guys, we must support these small businesses when we can because they really need it. For some, its enforce the stupid restrictions or lose everything.</p></p>

        <p>The world-wide global government has crippled these people with this agenda. I miss my barber...older Italian fella who always cut my hair with a smile, he swore that he'd go berserk if our government locked down a third time...but they did. It's sadder seeing so many virtuous c*nts cheer this on and say it's for the greater good. There's nothing "good" about any of this.</p>

        <p>It makes me so angry how the well-off bystanders all cry about "muh covid cases" but will turn a blind eye to this. This is a slow death for some people because they're already hanging by a thread. Its clear the government is all about crushing small business owners and forcing everyone to rely on big corporations. I wish I could do more for the ones who suffer.</p>

        <p>This is true. Reminds me of when lockdowns and restrictions started, suicide rates went through the roof, and then apparently Melinda Gates said that she just never really considered that lockdowns may have bad effects on people</p>
