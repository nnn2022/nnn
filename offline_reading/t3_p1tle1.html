        <p>Yes, herd immunity would be a joke as the vaccine does not prevent anything except Big Pharma profits dropping.</p>
<p><strong>Official Numbers:</strong></p>
<p>https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>36.78 million cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>330 million population</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>11% infected by Covid since January 2020</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The vaccine does not produce sterilizing immunity, thus the vaccinated are superspreaders as we see breakthrough cases (vaccinated people being infected)... of a respiratory illness... in the middle of the summer ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>How can getting an injection that doesn't prevent infection or spread help prevent infection and spread?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>How can 89% of America that never contracted Covid magically have that same virus mutate inside of them?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I just wanna be the best sheep I can be, but the numbers make that impossible to believe</strong></p>

        <p>"In a parliamentary panel on Tuesday, Professor Sir Andrew Pollard warned that herd immunity is a ‚Äúmythical‚Äù concept and should not inform the design of vaccination programmes in the UK or across the globe."</p>
<p>"Data published last week by Public Health England found there is little difference in how much virus is present in vaccinated and unvaccinated people who test positive for Covid-19, suggesting the shots do not suppress viral replication as much as hoped. Scientists had believed that a lower viral load would prevent onward transmission."</p>
<p>"This virus is not measles ‚Äì if you have 95 per cent of people vaccinated against measles, the virus cannot transmit in the population,‚Äù said Sir Andrew. ‚ÄúBut we know very clearly with the coronavirus that the delta variant will still infect people who have been vaccinated, and that does mean that anyone who‚Äôs still unvaccinated, at some point, will meet the virus.‚Äù</p>
