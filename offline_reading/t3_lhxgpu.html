    <strong>No lessons learned; Newfoundland, Canada embarks on its "two weeks lockdown" journey as it experiences community transmission for the first time.</strong>
    <p><p>Let me share with you a tale of a province with leaders (and people) so smug who thought they could beat nature and keep the virus out forever. </p>
<p>Newfoundland, being an island, followed the New Zealand approach and shut down their province to all "non-essential" travel in May last year. Following which they have had no transmission of the virus among their population which has led to the population not developing any immunity. The last death in the province was in October. A quick search brings out the CBC article which of course doesn't mention any underlying conditions the man in his 60's might have had. </p>
<p>The travel ban was challenged by a woman who wasn't allowed to attend her mother's funeral. In the court, the chief health officer opened with a written submission to the judge with the quote: "In 1775 the American revolutionary Patrick Henry declared, ‘Give me liberty or give me death.’ In this case, if the applicants’ remedy is granted, it will result in both." The Supreme Court of the province eventually upheld the ban. </p>
<p>Of course, having no cases didn't mean the stupid mask mandate or social distancing would be over. Going to the mall, not a single person could be seen without a mask. That's just Canada for you, but here it seems to be on a different level with a mask mandate for the customer even while having a haircut and people just patting themselves on the back for doing their part and being the sole reason that they have no cases. I've had a friend, who's been mature enough to hear me, say people here respect the rules, they wear their masks and are considerate of others and that's the reason that they have had no cases. </p>
<p>And after 11 months of this nonsense, finally, the dangerous "aerosol Ebola" of a virus has managed to reach their community. In the metro region of St John's - schools shut down, gyms closed, all recreational activities banned; bars, cinemas, hair salons banned, retail stores "that don't provide services essential to life" closed. All the usual theatre. Public paranoid. "Sheer panic" in the community, says the news. They have learned nothing. They have researched nothing. Nothing has been done to give them any facts. And it's been a year. Almost all the 230 or so active cases are among the people under 60 with 80% being under 20 because some high school kids had a few parties. No talks of the number of hospitalizations because now, not one death but one case is too many and quality of life and freedom doesn't mean anything at all.</p>
<p>An English professor(she/her) in the university sent an announcement that things are a bit of a mess in the city and they should have closed things down on Monday but no one asked her. Ended the email asking us to stay safe and wear our masks. What she doesn't know because of her privileged white middle-class lifestyle who thinks she's so good virtue signalling and parroting the media-induced fear, is that no one in India cares about the virus. People live here normally. There's no stigma against not wearing a mask. There are parties in closed venues where people dance at each other's shoulders. And millions of farmers, who are old in age are protesting in the cold winters for themselves and their future generations’ livelihoods. The virus is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>What I have found is that the more disconnected, the more isolated, the more coddled up people are, the more they support lockdowns. They simply have no idea about the atrocities in the world and how harsh life actually is. They are stuck in their little bubbles and have no insight. All they talk about is how oppressed they are and how the government should give them more and do more. Almost all of my friends in nations where people don't live such privileged lives see this bullshit and can understand how stupid locking yourself up for a virus which does nothing to anyone is. </p>
<p>But I live here. And can do nothing at all. My date cancelled on me. My gym is closed, who knows for how long. I try to focus on my studies but it’s hard. Nothing gives me any hope that my university won’t still be online next fall. And I’ll have to do all my major CS courses online.  Even if it is in-person, we can be sure that all the theatre is not going away anytime soon. Maybe they’ll even force me to take the vaccine and absolutely won’t care that I’ve already got the virus before. I wonder what I put myself into.</p></p>
