        <p>I never wear a mask anywhere I go except Costco since they'll kick you out.  Even Target leaves me alone.  I've been to gas stations, local shops, restaraunts, etc. without any issue.</p>
<p>I did get confronted once at Walmart after having gone there multiple times without issue.  The chick that greets people told me I needed to put a mask on or else I'd have to leave.  I put one on, walked past her and promptly took it off.  I didn't want to make a scene so I just dealt with it for 10 seconds.</p>

        <p>I started with taking my 6 yr old to stores without masks and keeping mine below my nose as a test. People actually smile at my child for NOT having a mask on and that made me feel good. Now I've moved to no masks for me too. One of the places I NEVER wear a mask is my gym - it's crowded as all get out and should be a covid-factory but the only people who consistently wear masks are teenagers who've been indoctrinated at school (sadly) while the rest of us don't wear them.</p>
<p>In stores when I am out I actively look for those without masks and make eye contact with me or give them quiet thumbs up/fist. We need to make NO masks  NORMAL again!</p>
<p>Problem stores: Costco, Walmart, Panera.</p>

        <p>I wear my mask as a chin diaper so people can't see from afar that it's not fully on. Walked past a pretty chick walking extremely slowly with no mask on in the grocery store and she gave me a big smile. First time I'd had an equivalent of "the nod" over not wearing it and it was great!</p>

        <p>Yes. I was walking on an empty street one morning without a mask (had it in my hand just in case, because here you have to wear them outside as well and if a policeman sees you without one you'll get a fine) - and someone started shouting at me from their window!</p>

        <p>My gym went through various phases of enforcing it when other gyms started to get shut down. One time they told me I had to wear a mask on the treadmill &amp; I asked “seriously, on the treadmill?”. I let it blow over and started running outdoors instead for a few weeks because I knew it was because they were getting pressure, not because they wanted to enforce it. Sure enough when I went back they had become more lax and I didn’t have to wear it while running anymore. Someone bolder (probably some adrenaline laced jacked dude) probably got in their face about it to the point where they backed down</p>

        <p>When I went to run around the track at the school I saw they were making kids as young as 7-8 wear masks outside while playing soccer. All the high school teams wearing them too while playing (with the exception of maybe football). I couldn’t imagine how awful that is for them, as if school wasn’t unpleasant enough</p>

        <p>Even those states have to have documentation for why they are firing you. That's why they made you sign that paper. I've seen it once in FL and MANY times in NY. Both are right to work states that didn't fire people who deserved it because they needed lots of documentation.</p>

        <p>I have never worn a mask, ever. I mostly get confronted by the employee at the entrance like 50% of the time. They ask me if I need a mask or that I’m required to wear one. I simply answer “I can’t wear one”. </p>
<p>Last night when I went to Walmart the greeter was bringing a cart back as I was walking in, she said “ you know they make me ask you”. I said “ I know, you’re just doing your job” and said my usual thing.</p>
<p>When Walmart first mandated masks I went in there the day of and was confronted by a young couple. I was going against the arrows and the man said, “can’t follow the arrows either”. I pretended I didn’t hear them and keep doing as I was which seemed to piss then off more.</p>
<p>Another time I kept running into the same older lady throughout the store and every time I was near her I saw her side eye me and I could tell she wanted to say something. She waited until we were in an aisle by ourselves. She touches the outside of her mask and says, “you’re not wearing your mask”. Lol no shit. Again I just ignored her and kept walking as she stared at me.</p>
<p>The way I look it is if you are an employee, you’re just doing your job. If your a random person I owe you nothing.</p>

        <p>I'm so glad the arrows went away. At first it seems like no big deal until you realize you have to walk all the way tf back around PASSING PEOPLE to get to the other side. I started just going backwards to avoid confrontation, but it went away over the summer.</p>

        <p>Yep, in my condo building. The same ladies, twice. I usually try to avoid the lobby so I don't have to listen to them and when I do go there, I make sure I'm far away from them. But I guess that isn't good enough for them. Someone actually left a note at my door regarding masks. I wanted to respond but I decided against it.</p>

        <p>A number of times. But eventually you find places where you won't be confronted.</p>
<p>- I used to visit McDonalds sometimes in the weekend. They made me wear a mask once, the first time i went round after masks became compulsory inside public buildings. I havent gone back since and switched to a small local snackbar. I never ever went there before Covid.  Nice stuff, cheaper, they dont make me wear masks. Half of the time the nice lady who runs it has her mask hanging from one ear.  She has never once mentioned me needing to wear one.  We are on first name bases now. No more Golden Arches for me. i kinda like supporting this local business more. They re-did the entire inside of the tiny restaurant-snackbar part. it look gorgeous but no one is allowed to use it. I occasionally fetch a coffee before going to get food and I just sit down a bit with my coffee waiting for the food. It's not really allowed but after the first time of me mentioning how nice the place looked and how comfortable the seat are now she was won over and kinda let me do what i wanted. </p>
<p>- They try to make us wear them on trains/PT. The have also recently become compulsory on platforms and at buss stops etc etc even though like 50% of these are outside.../ I do not wear one at the stations. I put it on for the 10 seconds of walking into the train. Then as soon as I'm seated i take it off. Sometimes the ticket inspectors tell me to wear one. I put it on, they leave, i take it off. My fellow passengers have never asked me anything. I make it my business to smile extra widely at people with their masks under their noses or under their chins to encourage them hopefully.  Just yesterday I was on PT and the conductor came to see my ticket. I handed it over. Looked him  right in they face and he never mentioned my missing mask. </p>
<p>- They try to make us wear them at grocery stores, and there it is actually quite enforced at times. There is more staaf it seems and they do come up to me to tell me i need to wear one or stop me from going into the store without one. I've gotten into the habit of doing the same thing i do with the trains. Put one on for the 10 seconds of getting a cart and walking into the store, then taking it off and smiling extra kindly at the store clerks. Sometimes i run into fellow maskless shoppers and we kinda nod. </p>
<p>-  I ran into my old Highschool head-mistress once, at the local shopping center. We do have to wear mask in there as well as in each individual store. I was not. She is a very firm lady who used to love me, and apparently still does, cause i was such a teachers pet and made friends with all the teachers. She was wearing a mask but we kinda got chatting. She's not native Dutch so she has somewhat of an accent. Always did since I've known her. After me saying "sorry what did you say? " a handful of times she actually lowered the mask to her chin to talk to me. She did later on ask why i wasnt wearing one. Now she knows I had whooping cough as a kid so i just told her it was because of that. That does feature into it, and my other reasons are none of her business.</p>

        <p>Got yelled at today on a run. Northeast liberal city. This lady asked me “don’t you think wearing a mask is a good idea?”
I smiled politely and just said I don’t think they work and kept running. It’s truly so uncomfortable but I feel like not wearing a mask OUTSIDE ON A RUN is one of the only ways I can stand up to these insidious rules.</p>

Torrid (plus size clothing store) told me to put one on and I walked out and after a loyal customer of 16 years never spent another penny there. 
So far that's it. Bed bath and beyond asked me to but I used the medical exempt and they said ok no prob.</p>
