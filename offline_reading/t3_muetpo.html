        <p>Not OP, but I'll give my thoughts on this, none of these are facts, I'm just simply responding to your questions. I'm not an expert in immunology. </p>
<p>&rt; Have you ever stopped and asked yourself why locked down masked states have not had any better numbers than unmasked (mostly) free states. </p>
<p>I have seen some graphs and articles about this and if I remember correctly only 8ish states didn't have any lockdowns and they were all Midwest with lower population densities. </p>
<p>The majority of the lockdowns were March 2019 - June 2019 though, so looking at data from today isn't as important imo. Would be more interesting to see data from a month or so after the lockdowns ended vs states that didn't.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Have you stopped and asked yourself why is it the god err.. expert is wearing two masks even though he’s been vaccinated for months </p>
<p>I'm assuming your talking about Dr. Fauci, personally I think part of the reason is public image, him wearing a mask shows it's important for others to wear a mask. Another possible reason is from my understanding mRNA vaccine doesn't necessarily stop the spread, it stops you from getting symptoms as well as stopping the virus from replicating as much. Which gets to the final result we're trying to avoid, the virus mutating into another strain and being back to day 1.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Have you stopped and asked yourself if the lockdowns (which clearly didn’t stop the spread) were worth the increase of 1.6 million tuberculosis deaths, 600k HIV deaths, and 400k malaria deaths? </p>
<p>This I don't know or have heard anything about. From looking at the numbers, these must be global. I would assume lockdowns would stop the spread of things like TB and HIV. Possibly issues in 3rd World countries with preventive care being shutdown?</p>
<p>Either way, Definitely unfortunate for countries still dealing with easily treatable illnesses in general.</p>
<p>Again all guesses, know nothing of this topic, I'll add it to my list to check out when I'm bored.</p>
<p>&rt; Have you ever stopped and asked yourself if it’s cool that UNICEF warned of 1.2 million child deaths  </p>
<p>Definitely an unfortunate effect on 3rd world countries that lockdowns caused. I think this ask a good thought experience,  should a country self preserve to save a few of their own at the risk of losing many of others. I'm not really sure on an answer for this, something I haven't thought about before.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;“visits to health care centers are declining due to lockdowns, curfews and transport disruptions, and as communities remain fearful of infection.” </p>
<p>This is definitely true, a lot of people impacted in many ways due to covid and the response to it.  Definitely makes me think about how much disruption of peoples lives is worth the life of another. Also not very sure on my answer to this either.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Have you stopped and asked yourself if the lockdowns were worth the fact that 25.5% of young adults have had suicidal thoughts Atleast once over a month. </p>
<p>Mental health has been a huge issue even before covid, though it definitely exasperated it. There were definitely pros and cons of lockdowns, we'll never know what covid would have been if we've done nothing to try an prevent it, but we'll definitely know the effects of our actions after it's over.</p>

        <p>Not OP, but I've actually thought about this a lot. Generally, I accept information given to me from professionals of that field. Even more so if it's a collective of that field, peer reviewed articles, collective groups etc. I can read all the articles, studies and information I can find about a subject, but it's unlikely I'll have more knowledge than someone who has specialized in this field for 20+ years. I'd have to spend all my free time learning and studying. </p>
<p>Even then, that's just one topic, It's impossible for one person to know everything about everything, that's why a community is important and I tend to trust professionals in their fields, again assuming it's been peer reviewed and accepted by a great majority of that field.</p>
<p>That being said there is always the possibility of a great conspiracy theory, of governments paying off thousands or even millions of people to fit their current needs. I find this highly unlikely due to how many people would have to keep quiet to keep it a secret. I tend to follow occam's razor on this one though.</p>

<p>Do you believe that covid will end? In my state, Florida, we have seen a loosening on restrictions and some officials are thinking about removing the mask requirements in schools.</p>

        <p>Well the issue with critical discussion is a little more complex than merely seeing a question as a threat.  It has more to do with bad players wrecking it for the few with genuine curiosity and open minds discussing an issue that has purposefully been used to blur the lines between public health and politics.</p>
<p>The Covid restrictions aren't going to end in some places until the public gets sufficiently fed up and tells the people exploiting the situation for political purposes that "enough is enough".  There's much in the narrative that's created to keep us divided- catering to "underserved communities" and the coordinated concern for "equity" which sets up restriction dissent as racism.</p>
<p>I'm no "doubter" that the virus exists and presents an extraordinary threat to a very small portion of the population.  My doubts are solely in the motives of the people who are using this to control life for the entire population instead of devoting energy and resources to protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>The sum total of what's happened since March '20 add up to the restrictions being the objective and not a temporary remedial thing.  It amounts to tyranny for which they have yet to pay an appropriate political price.</p>
<p>My opinion and nothnig more.</p>

        <p>Once again thank you for this! I really enjoyed reading that. It explains your point well and it does make sense.</p>

        <p>You went from "Hi! Thanks for responding" to all caps yelling at people to remember 3rd grade science in a very patronizing tone to telling people they have not even a spark in their brains.</p>
<p>How does it make you feel after responding to somebody like that? Does it feel good afterwards? Or does it make you feel a little uneasy? I'm asking you these questions because personally I've in past internet debates a million times more heated than this, and the only thing I remember is how bad I felt afterwards and have no idea what the debates were even about. </p>
<p>If you go back to your comments from the span of the last hour, step back a little bit and just observe. What tone or vibes are you giving off? If people ignored the substance of your comments, and just focused on the tone, what would they think?</p>
<p>Do you think it's possible if somebody squinted from afar, that they could think your comments were giving off "crazy соnspirаcy nut" vibes? For some reason this subreddit gets labelled as the соnspirаcy crazies but everyday a brigader from mainstream reddit outdoes us with an absolutely off the rails fuming post trying to incite something.</p>
<p>Secondly, this is rhetorical but: if a person here were to do a 180 on their views, and join your side, is it enough to just change their opinion? Or do they also have to become like you and interact like you? Would they have to try to forcefully convince nay-sayers like you do? And if the forced conversion doesn't work, how many responses until they have to resort to name calling? Is it three or four? How similar are we talking in regards to these interactions? Is it alright if somebody does the all-caps rage posting but doesn't imply others are brainless without a spark of intelligence like you did earlier? What are the most critical aspects of your tone that people should adopt?</p>

        <p>Yes it was childish of me to act like that. I don't necessarily feel uneasy, but rather like a fool for not calming myself before speaking/typing. I only came here for discussion but after trying to speak my point and being met by brick walls I quickly became frustrated. I did not come here with any hope of changing minds but rather talk about the apparent gap in amounts of evidence for vs evidence against.</p>

        <p>You're making a huge mistake in assuming posters here look for / consider information outside of their bubble. It's called an echo chamber for a reason; as far as they can tell all their evidence is correct and everyone agrees.</p>

        <p>I am in so much pain right now. I thought maybe we could have a civil discussion about why they believe what they believe, but its like they keep trying to checkmate me when we are playing uno.</p>
