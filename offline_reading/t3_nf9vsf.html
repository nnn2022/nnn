    <strong>Brace yourselves, We’re seeing an increase in brigading</strong>
    <p><p>I’m noticing pro-new normal opinions being upvoted to the point they remain positive, plus the increase in those kind of commentaries. </p>
<p>Not only that, I saw two or three statements confirming this is happening. </p>
<p>Knowing that, pay attention for anything that they can post here which could make our space being banned or quarantined.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. Off topic I am someone who is and was part of the “goth” world. It’s very difficult to try and balance that and having a good paying job. It’s also more expensive to live in the big cities where they have regular goth nights at bars. I also live in a small town. A much more economical way to live is to only do enough to get what you need from the world and sorta just live without other things.  I’ll explain it. Do just enough to fit in with the locals on the surface so they buy it and just live without much extra like going without a relationship or many friends because on a personal level where you live and the typical people who also live there just aren’t really your idea of a good time.</p>

        <p>Yyyyesss... but also kinda no.</p>
<p>I agree with the sentiment to not live extravagantly and keep things more simple, but wearing a facade to ‘fit in’ with the locals is betraying your inner self from being accepted.
Not saying that you should go completely off the deep end, but very few outside of the White Collar corporate types care if you have more piercings or dress all in black or wear leather. </p>
<p>Also, relationships are a core foundation of everybody. Even if they are few and far between, the joy of really connecting with somebody else cannot be done away with.</p>
<p>Who knows - maybe if you go about being totally yourself, you’ll find more people willing to follow <strong>your</strong> lead.</p>

        <p>There’s not many younger people where I live, it’s mainly retired people. I appreciate the sentiment but where I live has more than the odd redneck and to them anything that’s outside their idea of comfort is strange. People have been attacked and harassed because of how they looked, like Sophie Lancaster who was a goth who was beaten by idiots and ended up dying later. Maybe I’m making some of the people that live where I do worse than they are but I have always avoided the night life here because despite it could lead to friendship, love and employment I just didn’t want to be bullied and I lived here most of my life so I remember how kids were</p>
<p>I also just deep down don’t want to live here. It would bother me to live here “on purpose”. Like virus is one thing, having disability that affects my muscle strength and balance which affects what kind of job I can do is another but I just would never feel good about living here.</p>

        <p>LMAO steam punk modern mideval bi guy here who was consistently beat up harassed attacked in my small home town growing up for being different. Let me tell you something when you live in a place like that its better to hide who you are than put up with the constant abuse. This is why I moved to a big city. So I can be myself. Thats the mentality of mob rule conform or leave or we will hurt you. Welcome to the tribal nature of humans. Highschool was the training grounds for this clique mentality.</p>

        <p>I’ve noticed a high amount of vax shedding posts lately (past week) now I will say I will entertain the idea but at this point it almost seems like a scheduled reminder of posts discussing it. I am almost sure that this is a topic that will be used to muddy our forum. It’s a wild claim nonetheless but these along with magnet posts could be part of the problem and being strategically used to take down, flood the feed, and just overall discredit our discussions</p>
