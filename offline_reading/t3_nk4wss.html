    <strong>Genuine question, what’s in it for the politicians?</strong>
    <p><p>I like this sub and agree with 80-90% of the content. However something I just can’t wrap my head around is why would politicians want to subject everyone to this shit?</p>
<p>I live in the UK and am aware most politicians are incredibly stupid. We have only just been allowed to see a family member for the first time in 8 months. With a total of 100 people out of 70 million currently on a ventilator. </p>
<p>Clearly the politicians must know how absurd this is. They must know that me wearing a mask walking in to the pub, walking 7 feet to my table then talking it off is utterly banal. They cannot be that stupid surely. </p>
<p>So why are they doing this? What’s their motivation? What am I missing? Cheers!</p></p>

        <p>To expand upon this a little...</p>
<p>The government wants more power, thats their end goal. Pretty much every mayor thinks "mayor is great, but what about <em>emperor?</em>"</p>
<p>The government's power comes from the people's unwillingness to resist. The czar of Russia is a good example of what happens when the ruling class is sitting on top of people who are willing to overthrow them. So you have to beat that spirit out of people.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to subjugate people is to humiliate them until they are too ashamed to raise their heads. That's the reason the nazis started their campaign against the jews by having the state media mock and belittle them, and shame them for their inborn privilege.</p>
<p>A particularly effective method of ritual humiliation is to force the victim to knowingly repeat a lie over and over. Because that reinforces in the victim's own mind that they are too afraid or ashamed to stand up and tell the truth. And because of that, the best propaganda to use for this is the most absurd: "Kim Jong Un was born from a stone egg laid by a divine bird," for example. Everyone saying it knows it is false. But they know that they themselves are too weak to tell the truth, and the people around them are just as weak, and might turn on them if they don't toe the line. </p>
<p>So when you wear your mask in banal situations like you describe, it isn't about the mask, it's about you telling the government 'I would rather knowingly lie for you than stand up to you."</p>

        <p>When communism (with the transition period being socialism) is installed, the power of a nation becomes centralised. The higher you are in the pyramid, the more power you have. The most powerful humans in all of history have been the leaders of communist dictatorships. They killed hundreds of millions of people at their own whim. They could pass whatever policy they wanted and the people had to follow it or join the millions being killed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you want absolute power, you want communism. And you want to be one of the founders of that communism so that you have a shot at being that ultimate human being.</p>

        <p>Possibly they have been sold this as a way to avoid the "inevitable" banking/automation crash?   </p>
<p>"Look. We do it this way, or we have total chaos over the next 10 years and we dont know how to deal with that. But you cant tell anyone this is deliberate or we will have resistance.  Just remember, this is for the greater good of everyone.  If anyone criticizes you, just say it's better to be safe than sorry, and you made the best decision you could the information you had."</p>

        <p>I honestly think that this is a factor for many of them.  They can't just come out and say "look folks, we let the bankers get us hooked on monolithic usury, and there is no painless way off the ride.  We either inflate to infinity or deflate into a far worse great depression.  The ruling class wins either way."  </p>
<p>If they were to say something like that it would likely incite a panic and also violate their oath to safeguard classified information.</p>

        <p>Control and an effort to avoid the rope that is coming. </p>
<p>The world’s financial system is unsustainable, printing money out of thin air, playing with interest rates, and jacking up the deficit only further drives this country into the hands of the international bankers. Wars are started to continue propping up the dollar, no matter who dies. </p>
<p>The kicker is that this false system can only last so long, it is only a matter of time before the people realize this when they’re starving for days on end due to extraordinary prices for ordinary things, and then the violence begins. </p>
<p>If you beat people into submission, using a terror attack, “pandemic,” etc. you reduce the likelihood that those people will ever turn on them. Just look at how people refuse to admit Biden is a disaster for this country, and defend him despite knowing his presidency sucks. </p>
<p>Get prepared. There is indeed a reset coming, but we can’t know which way it will go until it is happening. Good luck and remember, dangerous freedom is infinitely better than safe slavery.</p>

        <p>A lot of good answers here. But remember, just because you don't understand or can't figure out what the motivations are, doesn't mean they aren't there.</p>
<p>I have no real understanding of why serial killers kill, but that's irrelevant to my decision not to get in their van.</p>

        <p>Power. But not in the way you think Jim average politician does not want the responsibility of power, he wants to maintain power. Joe average unelected scientist wants power this is the first time he has had power in his life and he’s not giving it up. Jim wants to maintain power so rather than make a decision that is the correct one will backfire on him tremendously, he just refers to Joe as an “expert” joe the unelected scientist has never had power so he wants it, but he also doesn’t want to open up because he’d lose his power. So Jim’s appetite for maintaining power while cowardice, combined with Joe’s want for newly acquired power, and cowardice is the reason they won’t give up.</p>

        <p>I think it started as a world effort to oust president Trump, which wouldn't have happened without the Covid psy op.   Just as Trump was ousted, the vaccines came out, then the new purpose was to sell vaccines.  Just like car insurance, health insurance and many other things, by making the vaccine mandatory, the politicians are making the vaccine bucks for big pharma.  The politicians will use covid for as many things as they can before letting it go.  However, the hysteria really has taken on a life of it's own.</p>

        <p>Control and power. It is coming to the great reset, where people in power and government will live like kings while the rest of us fight for scraps. This isn't a 2 year plan this is a generational plan. </p>
<p>Big business and global leaders just share their wealth around. They can freeze a country out of trades if they don't toe the line pushed down from above.</p>
<p>I am.in Australia and if our government doesn't do something world leaders/big business wants all they will do is just stop trading with us. Simple. We won't buy your resources or products if you don't do this. That is why every government in the world done the same thing for covid. Lock downs and masks. </p>
<p>So your government no matter where you live in the world is slowly selling you out for their gain. They stay in power. They might not agree with it as they think they are helping their constituents.</p>
