    <strong>Restaurants &amp; the mask ordinance</strong>
    <p><p>So I've been a DoorDasher since May, &amp; I've gone into various restaurants &amp; other businesses maskless without a problem. The Jackson County Missouri (where Kansas City is) mask ordinance took place in April or before &amp; has been extended twice. 1st until August, then until Inauguration Day (how coincidental).</p>
<p>So this whole time, I've only had issues with QuikTrip, busses, my own parents, &amp; a few other places off &amp; on. Well just this week, the grip has gotten tighter. I've gone to First Watch &amp; Wendy's as a customer, where they sent me out to grab a mask or else I wouldn't be served. Then at Goodcents Deli, I came in as a Dasher &amp; was sent out. At least <em>those</em> guys didn't force me to put it over my nose like what the 1st 2 did.</p>
<p>What happened? Why do they suddenly care about a mask order they've let me break for months without batting an eye? Did these restaurants finally get fined b/c Karens reported them for not pressing their thumb down hard enough (that or an inspector showed up), so now they <em>really</em> have to enforce the order?</p>
<p>Also, why restaurants where I can take it off once I sit down? I've mentioned the paradox to the employees, 1 agreed at Wendy's, the other at First Watch told me to email the CDC that question.</p>
<p>I'm remaining a Dasher mainly b/c I don't want to be muzzled all day working for a franchise or other service business. At least I'm using a Neck Gaiter &amp; not a face diaper.</p></p>

        <p>Yep. I've heard people say that they report businesses to the health department if they see someone inside without a mask. It's ridiculous</p>

        <p>Wow...this is crazy! I told my wife when they started posting billboards and digital ads with the NARC number, “Watch...people will eat this up! They can’t wait to NARC on each other. They have nothing better to do!”</p>

        <p>is it really an 'ordinance' or is a proclamation (dictate)?</p>
<p>i have yet to see any of these mask dictates to be duly debated and voted on by so called representatives or city council members</p>

        <p>Hello fellow KC resident! I haven’t had any trouble not wearing a mask north of the river so far. Try dashing in the Platte Woods zone if it’s not too far or if you can schedule a time - seems to be a bit better than other places.</p>

        <p>Ye, I'm sure Clay County doesn't have such an ordinance. Unfortunately, I live in Blue Springs, making the other side a long journey.</p>

        <p>They do have one as does Platte county but they don’t seem to be enforced up here. That’s too bad :( I’m hoping after the election people will start to get more lax about it because either they’ve already lost and can’t put up with this theatre for another 4 years, or they’ve gotten their way so no more need to make everyone miserable. I’m wondering if it being so close to the election is what’s making everyone really double down on it now.</p>
