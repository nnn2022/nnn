        <p>It’s likely due to a combination of mental illness rates being way up in general, and trauma due to thinking if they have it, it’s a death sentence for them or someone they care about.</p>

        <p>It would be a dream where in a few years even the doomers realize they were totally conned into believing the lies, massive amount of people around the world start class action lawsuits against every media corporation in their country for damaging their lives, and in some cases killing their loved ones.</p>
<p>Since I'm dreaming, let's add the INDIVIDUALS responsible for perpetuating the fear fined, or even sent to jail, not the "corporations"(which allow using company funds to pay the fines).</p>

        <p>Which of the following seems more likely? </p>
<p>a) Constant fearporn about the "killer virus" gives people anxiety.</p>
<p>b) A new strain of cold virus inexplicably starts causing mood disorders.</p>

        <p>For 3 and a half years, as a lefty, I hated Donald Trump and seriously felt depressed about his presidency on a day to day basis. It's only this year with everything that's happened that I realized: it wasn't Trump harming me, it was my perceptions of him which were being fed to me by the media. He did nothing to actually affect me and my day to day. The MSM had me believing he was the devil incarnate when his record was in no way worse than many other president's before him. Yet I was convinced it was him that was the cause of my depression.</p>
<p>The people showing these signs of anxiety and apathy exist because the media is trying to convince them that although they're perfectly healthy after recovering from covid, they fear they have these imaginary long-term complications that only happen to an extremely rare few... who were often very sick and frail to begin with. It's a self-diagnosis without proper context. They are convinced of this because this is what the media has propagandized them to believe with their constant onslaught of fear-mongering 24/7... of misconstruing and misrepresenting facts and twisting them into a horror narrative which simply is not true or based on any sort of demonstrable reality. Rare anecdotes are touted as the norm and people are convinced that this virus, which they most likely have already easily recovered from, will one day come back to kill/hurt them in unknown and completely unrealistic ways. Of course they're scared. Of course they're depressed.</p>
<p>The media is the virus. The media needs to be quarantined. And then all the post-covid mental illnesses and long-covid pseudo-symptoms will go away with them, I assure you.</p>
