    <strong>Question: Who do you think really made this thing blow out of proportion? Why did fear mongering work this time and not for Ebola/swine/e-coli? I see two main options for the former.</strong>
    <p><p>The first option is more conspiracy like. We know China used this to stop citizen protests. You think big corporations, hospital execs, health officials, and politicians slowly caught wind that fear was a good tactic to gain power and money? Big corp execs see small businesses shutting down, more use of online services, stocks going up up up. Politicians getting closer to the dystopian fascist state they dreamed of where they get fame and fortune. They manipulate death counts, censor speech, and KNOW the economic and mental and physical devastation they are causing for the working class.</p>
<p>The second option, I find WAY scarier.  The person from high school who was a girl or boy scout their whole life, probably joined school council or was the hall monitor. The nosy, control freak in the friend group. You know who I am talking about. She probably had horses on her sweater and carried hand sanitizer everywhere. </p>
<p>She was never popular and envies people who go out or who are more successful than her. She LOVES pandemic central planning, and is probably a politician or one of your friends yelling at everyone to stay in line right now. She loves making society sterile, puritanical, controlled, and devoid of all the things she never had, real human connection, finding new loves, dancing, being apart of something bigger. She loves knowing everywhere you go and everyone you see so she can make sure you are not enjoying life more than her now.</p>
<p>I personally think it is a mix of the two, evil corporate people and politicians who are aware of their damage deep down, but somehow justifying it, using the "Tammy" (sorry any Tammys) as a mouthpiece. Nudging  "society" towards this dystopia. Sadly I think there isn't an evil plot (wouldn't be surprised if there was ofc), I think this is really just bringing out the absolute worst in the absolute worst people, people that are missing something in their life, and need to justify their resultant laziness to virtue, using disgusting fear tactics to herd the working class. </p>
<p>What do you think? For real, how did it get to this?</p></p>

        <p>Probably why all the coverage is on "democracies". Bc the rest of the world probably doesn't give an f as much and isn't even dying of the disease (although they are def dying from the world economic crash, no one cares about millions being thrown into poverty though ofc). Media doesn't want to talk about countries that aren't erecting massive COVID central planning. Weird how this virus just targets the west lol.</p>
<p>Wonder how Sweden resisted this?</p>

        <p>Sweden is the posterboy of the NWO, cashless society, muslim invasion etc. They made so many nice things for the NWO in the past, so this time they were allowed to skip this shit.</p>
<p>But regarding other countries, which ones do you know which are really free? Argentina is on lockdown since March (and counting)...</p>

        <p>I kinda always assume that the prissy western countries are doing the massive central planning and I thought the rest of the countries don't have organized and big enough governments (and aren't full of neurotic girl scouts running govt) to erect and (especially) enforce massive central protocols. Didn't see it on the news at all. I mean a country like India that is so dense and poor should theoretically be overrun with disease but they aren't. Unless they are doing massive lockdowns? Need to research more I am learning</p>

        <p>I can only speak about my own country. My theories on why are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ebola didn't sound scary because of the likelihood for it spreading to Europe was low. Africa is an unpopular travel destination unlike Spain, Italy, China, France and so on. So, most people in my country would never get the opportunity to catch Ebola. Africa is known for being a bad destination according to people's standards in my area. Other horror stories scares them away more than the Ebola itself. E.g. the high crime rate, infrastructure, poverty and politics. Since we get to hear more about the bad things in Africa than the good things, many have a negative view on Africa as a whole.</li>
<li>The Swine and bird flu never scared most people either because of relatively low numbers infected in my country and it mostly affected only a few professions.</li>
<li>COVID19 is scary to most because of how easily it spreads. It has a different name than the flu, comes from a different country which is known, high infections rate and people hearing "new cases" everyday. It's not the death rate that makes COVID19 special, but it's that it's new and has a high infection rate. Which journalists, doctors and political leaders we've affects the whole scenario too. These ones working today may not be the same people for some years ago.</li>

        <p>I remember when I first found out about COVID, I was like, hmmm no big deal. Then I saw a "secret" video come out of China with a middle aged woman saying "China is trying to cover this up, its so horrible!" I think the video was a dirty little trick.  Anyway, thats when I thought, oh no bad! Now other countries are going to freak out. Shortly after, shutdowns started. At this point in the US at least, I think governors got duped, panicked, and now its too late to backtrack. They would rather have their states go bankrupt than admit a mistake. So here we are.</p>

        <p>Man I was really into NWO speculations during the Obama years when they tried to use the environment and middle eastern wars as a way to enact the NWO. I assumed that this time it was really just a big girl scout central planning bonanza based on the people I saw promoting it. But considering how especially evil these new measures I really shouldn't be surprised that waaaaay more evil things are being planned in the shadows. Time for a fun Friday night of digging!

<li>There’s a new virus people don’t know much about</li>
<li>Media uses new virus to drum up fear (to get clicks or watches, meaning more money)</li>
<li>People become afraid, and call for the government to act</li>
<li>The government, ultimately an institution beholden to the people (at least in democracies) either has to act or they risk losing their jobs</li>
<li>Media reports new government action as a reason to be scared</li>
<li>Repeat from step 3</li>
</ol>
<p>If we break the cycle of the media making people more afraid, we can stop the government from making misguided decisions based on fear rather than evidence. I feel like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/1clw5x/what_can_we_do_to_lessen_the_grip_of_fear_from/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">this post</a> very nicely shows how the media can make us all afraid and irrational.</p>
