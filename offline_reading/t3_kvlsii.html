    <strong>End it, or perpetuate it?</strong>
    <p><p>So we all saw Cuomo’s tweet. Two options I see going forward.</p>
<p>a) we end covid freak out, Biden can take credit </p>
<p>b) lockdowns on and off forevermore </p>
<p>I always thought it would be B. Somehow A pissed me off even more than B, but at the same time, I don’t even care anymore if we can just end this BS. </p>
<p>What say you?</p></p>

        <p>I don't think it ever really ends. It is now a tool in the toolbox and they will use for all sorts of things like weather, seasonal flu, etc. And, this was already in the works. E.g. it was widely reported when they started shutting down the NYC subway at night that it was the first time ever that the MTA had been shut down. But, that's not true. Just a few years ago de Blasio shut it down and locked down the city because some snow was expected and not even an extraordinary amount for NYC. We ended up getting such a manageable amount of snow that they didn't try pushing it further than a day, but that won't always be the case.</p>

        <p>I think that it's naive to think that this will all end after Biden inauguration. For one thing, people were saying that this was all going to end after the election before they went and moved the goalposts. I suppose there could be some reason to wait until inauguration to put things back to normal (just to discredit Trump as much as possible?) but to me it seems unnecessary.</p>
<p>For another thing, keep in mind that these lock-downs are happening across the entire planet. Now you can argue that even the globalists in other countries are out to get Trump but if that was really their goal then what is <em>their</em> motivation to keep this insanity all going after Biden election? Besides most other countries are saying ridiculous things like that we won't be back to normal for another couple years. </p>
<p>And finally I just don't believe that these people have any intention of giving up any power that they get. These lockdowns are like a wet-dream for the people that drool over the thought of ruling over their countries using a China-style technocratic government structure.</p>

        <p>Globalists are out to get the whole globe. Trump is not the end game, he was an obstacle that needed to be removed, and now that he has been, they are going to try to march on towards the great reset by destroying the entire global economy with lockdowns before swooping in with the solution, which will be a dressed up version of communism. How far they get from here is all up to us.</p>

        <p>Perhaps both A and B. Even if it were to “end” in the near future, it won’t be long before the next “emergency” and new lockdowns are ushered in.</p>

        <p>And it will be even more strict lockdowns because they saw just how easy people became scared and submissive to the lockdowns</p>
