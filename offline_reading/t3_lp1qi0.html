    <strong>Wearing a mask in social media/dating profile pictures is really messed up.</strong>
    <p><p>I see it on facebook, instagram, Tinder, Bumble, etc. People wearing masks in their pictures, like their main profile pictures. And they aren't even pictures where wearing a mask would make sense; it's usually just them wearing one for no reason other than the picture. And it's like why!? Why would you cover your face like that in a frickin' social media picture? Can corona infect photographs, too?</p>
<p>I mean, we all know why they do it: empty virtue signaling and cult-like submission, but still. There's something really sad about it. </p>
<p>What's especially sad is the dating app ones. Why on Earth would I swipe on you if I can't even see your face!?</p></p>

        <p>I would argue it's actually a good thing. The more they try showing off their hypochondria and paranoia, the less they breed, and while I don't support eugenics in any way, I must kinda acknowledge that the human species will probably be better off without their genes 😂</p>

        <p>You eugenics supporting bastard! But it's kind of true; even if they didn't scare away other people, they wouldn't breed anyway because social distancing is more important to them than life itself (also they are usually nihilists at the end of the day).</p>

        <p>I’d say at least 70% of profiles have at least one mask pic. Like it’s important in your dating decisions to know what they look like in a mask because masks are so normal now like here’s a shot with my hair up and hair down. Just bizarre. I’ve started to just swipe left on everyone that does this but it’s not leaving me with many options.</p>

        <p>To be honest, online dating has kind of become impossible regardless, at least if you're a dude, for one simple reason: 90% of women on dating apps are pretty much way too liberal to date in a serious capacity. It didn't used to matter as much, but in the last decade liberalism became too wrapped up into the cult of woke, and now it's unbearable. I used to not care about politics when it came to dating, until I dated a fresh college-grad liberal girl. My oh my that was a rough one. By the end (of two months dating her), we got into arguments pretty much every time I saw her because talking to her was like walking on eggshells. ANYTHING I said might be perceived as "problematic" and she'd get upset. And then she was shocked that I ended things and said that we could work through our differences. Turns out her idea of us working through our differences actually meant me opening my mind and realizing that her ideas were more enlightened than mine. Puke. And the crazy thing is, I'm not even a conservative. I'm a moderate. But to them, anything even slightly right of their position is full-blown Hitler mode. </p>
<p>I've stopped online dating altogether because 90% of women are woke, and the other 10% are fat.</p>

        <p>Hey now! 10% of women are fat, really? Thats so unbelievably.. inaccurate. The percentage of fat women is WAY higher than that, and you still shouldn't lower your standards to accommodate them. I bet you thought I was gonna call you fatphobic, didn't you? Heh.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's true. Most women are overweight on the dating apps. Sad, really. Imagine living in the days before the 2000s when you just didn't really need to worry about weight because most people were thin. If you have physical standards these days, it basically cuts out 85% of the dating pool.</p>

        <p>And the older you get, the more people become fat due to older age. Think of how many women that are fat at 30 but were skinny at 18? Once I hit 30 as a man, my options basically disappeared overnight.</p>

<p>thats so true for me. i pretty much have no dating pool. im so fucking sexually frustrated because the vast majority of americans are unfuckable.</p>
<p>he doesnt even need to have a 6pack (although it is a huge turn on), he just needs to be slim and slender. but theres so few slim and slender guys, let alone guys with 6packs. on top of that, i am super picky about personality, demeanor, way he carries himself, etc...</p>

        <p>Yup, at least 50 % singles are way too fat to get laid. Finding a proper woman is hard. Maybe you should try on a gun show, some church or wherever your sane women like to hang out. Dr. Nowzardan's clinic maybe?</p>

        <p>I'm female, to the left of the US Democratic party on most issues, and attracted to some fat girls...and I <em>still</em> know exactly what you're talking about! Used to be "friends" with a "social justice" girl...it got to the point where my speaking up too much in a group conversation was racism, and so was my treating a visit to a foreign country as a fun opportunity to do lots of tourism, and also my getting sarcastic while angry was "emotional abuse". She was also a college student in an elite private college...surprise surprise.</p>

        <p>I'm not in an elite private college but I almost thought you were describing someone who seems to have taken some kind of leader role.</p>
<p>Right now I don't remember what but she got riled up with something I said and claimed I was saying "micro racist" things, then she tried to rally the group against me and when I tried to make her realize she was the one who started it all she went like "oh no, I'll not respond to you anymore. This isn't time or the place" (whatever that was supposed to mean).</p>

        <p>Same thing happened to me. I’ve always been quite moderate, but I had some really woke opinions especially liberal feminist ones. My bf tried to have difficult discussions with me. For example I criticized my partner for listening to Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson and I refused to even talk to him about those people.</p>

        <p>Now that you mentioned it I do remember seeing something similar in an app mainly intended to help people make friends.</p>
<p>"If you voted for Trump/Bolsonaro then don't even talk to me" I can't  remember if I saw it in Portuguese or if it was in English but it was something like that. Hell even seemingly normal people were talking about white privilege or how irresponsible of them it was to speak as if they weren't privileged (for the mere fact of being white/white looking) and the fuckers weren't  even American! Hell, some of them were even Brazilian or from some latino shithole.</p>

        <p>&rt;90% of women on dating apps are pretty much way too liberal to date in a serious capacity</p>
<p>I don't doubt this at all. Where I live, back when I was using dating apps, pretty much all the guys where liberal potheads. I'm sorry you don't have a personality outside of weed and politics. Most guys were shocked by my political views because they just assumed I was left leaning because of my age and being female.</p>

        <p>I live near SF and this describes the majority of women on the dating apps around here. I just roll my eyes every time I see the profile of a dime a dozen freshly college graduated white girl spouting "BLM, ACAB, swipe left if you voted for Trump, wear a mask, etc." It is so hard to find someone who is actually interesting and thinks for herself and doesn't revolve her life around what is popular on social media or politics. The NPC meme is real around here. This is one of the reasons I am looking to move to a place with a more moderate political environment as I hope to run into a pool of more reasonable women.</p>

        <p>We exist, we are just in hiding (I'm also not single so not on dating apps but you get my point). I feel the exact same way you do about the stifling progressive conformity here and how at odds it is with the tolerance and critical thinking people here so smugly pride themselves on. I hate it. I bite my tongue every day because I honestly think I'd be fired from my tech job otherwise, and I know I'd be a social pariah.

        <p>Nope.  My ex-gf is the only person I'm friends with on FB who has a mask on in their profile pic.  It too is in a situation where you wouldn't wear a mask.  Not only is she not ugly, but she's a true narcissist and thinks she's all that (she's not).</p>

        <p>I can honestly say the only masked selfies I've ever taken were in a voting booth and when I was in court with someone. Kinda not optional in either situation. And neither one was my profile pic, just pics I shared because they were important milestones in my life. </p>
<p>What really creeps me out are the mask avatar pics. You're using an avatar...cool (at least for social media. If I did online dating I'd find that weird). But I can't even see the face of the cartoon version of you? Are you protecting me from a computer virus? I don't get it. </p>
<p>Same with masked bathroom selfies. Dude, get a fart fan and a glade plugin and lay off the Taco Bell, and you won't need a mask in the bathroom.</p>

        <p>You just gotta have patience. I’m a relatively conservative anti mandatory mask and lockdown girl in my early 20s. I’m in San Diego which tends to be pretty liberal but we also have a lot of military bases so a lot of dudes who lean farther right. You gotta sift through a lot of losers but eventually you’ll find a guy that isn’t awful. I was about ready to throw in the towel when I met my boyfriend.</p>

        <p>It’s an instant left swipe, but it’s bizarre that these people think a virus can be transmitted over an app. Because they wear a mask simply because they believe it prevents transmission, right? And not for any other reasons?</p>

        <p>I actually love this trend because I can use it to figure out who is worth my time or not. The ones who wear it everywhere and in their profile icon are weak and insecure children who can’t stand up for themselves and probably have no independent thoughts or opinions outside of what their friends and society tell them to do. It’s like they wear their red flag instead of making you find it.</p>
