    <strong>Today at Home Depot.</strong>
    <p><p>I had my first encounter with a Karen. I've heard that these creatures exist but I was starting to think they were mythological due to the fact that no one other than a very small amount of store clerks, has ever said shit about my maskless face. I'm 6'4" 320 and I own a construction company.  Needless to say people generally leave me the fuck alone about it. </p>
<p>Anyways today I was standing in line with my lumber (I was next and the registers are like 20' from the start of the line so it looked like I was standing there like an idiot) and this lady in a tie dye shirt and an N95 mask asks if I'm in line. I say yes and take a drink from my Monster but I swallowed wrong and choked like the first time I hit a joint lol. </p>
<p>She fucking lost it.  She said very loudly "you're supposed to wear a mask in here, where is your mask!" 
I just said I don't wear those things. 
She storms off screaming that this guy is coughing and he's not wearing a mask! Just raging and REEEEEEing all the way to the service desk. By this time I'm already paying for my shit and I got out of there but what an asshole. Like seriously you watched me choke on my drink and you're going to make a scene like that? </p>
<p>Anyways, glad to be here with other sane people.  Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>Edit: Grammer was killing me.</p></p>

        <p>Had one of these in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond today. They have signs up all over saying masks required, the fine print at the bottom says those under 10 and with medical issues that prevent mask wearing are exempt. I’ve never had any issues in there but today an employee came and found me at the back of the store and asked me to put a mask on. Politely told her I am medically exempt and she said “oh ok, I’m just required to ask you, thanks for letting me know, you’re fine”. All was well until I was in line, some dude turns around and starts harassing me about not wearing a mask and says “I told them to have you put one on, did you not listen to that either?” So that’s the reason she came to speak to me. Absolutely insane, he was going on and on about how I’m irresponsible blah blah blah. I pointed out he was putting himself more at risk standing there screaming in my face than he would have been just standing in line with his back to me and that just set him off more, I wasn’t sure whether to be amused or pissed. He then proceeded to yell at the cashier for not forcing me to wear a mask and left in a huff. It’s ridiculous, these people should not be in public if they’re truly that afraid, but i have a feeling it’s more of the virtue signaling “I am mad that you’re not showing me you respect me” BS or the “I have to do this so you have to as well” crap and not actual fear or logic behind it.</p>

        <p>These are the people who yelled at people for standing up and protesting for their right to work and earn a living. For going and enjoying life. For seeing friends and family. But then went out and encouraged others to protest BLM because “it means something more and is necessary”. If it’s something they want to do they can go out and do it but if it’s you wanting to do it you’re killing grandma. </p>
<p>Had a friend yell at everyone for eating out during a pandemic and complaining about the indoor dining closures, then posted a photo at the mall today excited to shop the sales. When they want to go out or not wear a mask it’s fine but when it’s anyone else they have to cause a fuss to look righteous.</p>

        <p>For sure.  I just don't get it.  Like fine, you want to protest then go for it.  You want to wear a mask? Do it. I literally don't care what strangers do with their lives and just want the same yet some people seem to crave the attention. It's embarrassing.</p>

        <p>I think it's more about controlling others than fear, too, at least in a lot of cases. I had a woman yell at me for standing in line like 5 feet behind her instead of 6. There was a wide open space in front of her; she could easily have stepped forward if she wanted to hit the magic social distance number. But it was more important to her that <em>I</em> move.</p>

        <p>You're not actually medically exempt tho. You think they want to work minimum wage with a risk of death (real or not) in their head every day?</p>
<p>People like you tilt them because they think the virus is real and you just hope it isn't. If you don't want to wear a mask stay home or ask the business before going. It's a much bigger statement to call to see if they allow mask free than to act like a Karen in store. Yes. Both you and op are the Karens if wearing a mask inconvenience you enough to be pissed at people.</p>
<p>The reason you hate them is because they complain at you, the reason they hate you is because they think your actions could kill them or family members, could get them fired, could get the store closed etc.</p>
<p>Dont you see how one is a much better excuse to be pissed off than the other?</p>
<p>If you have trouble breathing with a mask maybe you should stay home safe because a cold would probably kill you</p>
<p>I don't care if masks work or not. I don't care if the virus is real or not. You're not helping your point doing that kind of shit. You'd be surprised at the amount of people wearing masks and thinking it's bullshit. Being a Karen in a store will only make those people not want to associate with you.</p>

        <p>Why you say in quote "fucking with you" when I clearly talked about the workers. It doesn't affect me. It affects them. They are bottom of the money ladder jobs where they're all under extreme stress because they believe the TV mostly. They're stuck with those jobs because a third of the economy is closed right now.</p>
<p>I just don't get what makes you want to fuck with people just trying to put food on the table. Maybe they even agree with you but they'd be fired if they don't escort you out. You don't know. </p>
<p>It's your government you need to pressure if you want to be left alone. Not Joe working for 7 bucks an hour. It just completely destroy your side of the argument and you'll never win. It's not like I'm making this shit up, "anti-maskers" are regulars on /r/publicfreakout for a reason. Doesn't look good for your side. Be clever about it if you actually want things to change.</p>

        <p>I don’t. I have never not worn a mask in public since covid started or treated a worker poorly in my life. I have been in a position where I was required to enforce the mask mandate and hated it. Some people on this sub are like that but I’m not. I didn’t even read your full first comment honestly, just the virtue signaling stuff at the end. I totally agree with treating employees with respect and blaming the government instead. But it sounds like the Karen in the original post was another customer, not an employee, so she should have minded her own damn business. Sorry my one-liner comment bothered you so much and led you to making a bunch of assumptions about me! But I’m done responding to this conversation, have a nice day.</p>

        <p>I was assaulted and now have extreme panic attacks when my nose and mouth are covered. You can fuck off with your “no medical exemptions bullshit”. If my unmasked face scares you so much stay home but stop trying to force me to stop living my life due to something I didn’t ask for and cannot change. And stop with the “if you don’t want to wear a mask stay home”. No, I’m not the one that did anything that massively rocked normality and made it so people had to change their lives dramatically, that was people like you. You have the problem, <em>you</em> stay home and let those of us who didn’t ask for or want any of this live. If I stayed home because I can’t wear a mask I would have offed myself from the depression months ago, because of what people like you are pushing. You’re robbing us of our lives. I could die tomorrow, with just about any reason other than covid being the likely culprit and I’d have spent nearly the last year of my life miserable, unable to do anything I love, because of people like you. Staying home for months, or what’s looking like a year or two plus at this point is not a feasible solution for someone who doesn’t <em>want</em> to stay home. </p>
<p>Most minimum wage employees, and people, are at incredibly low risk from this. They’d be just as much at risk from other communicable diseases they could get while working, yet that’s never been an issue for you before has it? The people that are truly afraid of death should be, and likely are, staying home already. Self preservation is strong in humans so if someone sees a credible threat, they’ll remove themselves from the situation I’m done. I’m done arguing with people like you because you can’t get out of your thick skulls enough to see how others’ lives are being destroyed because suddenly you have a chance to virtue signal and feel like a big person and control others.</p>
