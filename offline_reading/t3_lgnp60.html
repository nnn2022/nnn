    <strong>Top 18 Reasons Why You Shouldn’t Take Any Of The Experimental mRNA Treatments (updated and reposted due to necessity of having it all in one list. Please share.)</strong>
    <p><p>Of all the threats we’re facing right now, I consider the mRNA “vaccine” to be the most pressing and immediate.</p>
<p>Where in all of the MSM is any semblance of informed consent? This wilful ignorance like a spell over it and the people who consume it is sickening and most probably criminal.</p>
<p>While, disappointingly, most still believe in the COVID psyop, I believe there is an instinctual revulsion and mistrust surrounding vaccines in general and the mRNA treatments specifically. Rather like the U.K. and its initial implicit belief that the royal family had a hand in Princess Diana’s death, we KNOW something is wrong with this picture. Most would prefer to wait, despite being told vaccines are the only possible ransom/ parole for their current captivity. Calling this mad scramble “Operation Warp Speed” in the US and “Operation Moonshot” in the U.K., does little to dispel such fears. The former connotes an intense, irresponsible rush, the latter an ”enterprise” with an unlikely and uncertain outcome.</p>
<p>Here are my top 20 reasons to avoid the current rollouts:</p>
<p>20) Edit - MIS - “The Centers for Disease Control is investigating if Dr. Barton Williams, an orthopedic doctor, died from Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome.“ </p>
<p>“Williams also had been vaccinated for COVID about a month ago and that testing found the two types of antibodies in his system - one type of antibody that results from a natural COVID infection, and a second type of antibody from the vaccine. Threlkeld also said Williams tested negative for COVID-19 while in the hospital.“</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210212031015/https://www.kens5.com/article/news/investigations/memphis-doctor-believed-to-have-died-of-rare-covid-related-syndrome/522-7bb29487-c330-4de4-b1b0-188fe3865e35">https://web.archive.org/web/20210212031015/https://www.kens5.com/article/news/investigations/memphis-doctor-believed-to-have-died-of-rare-covid-related-syndrome/522-7bb29487-c330-4de4-b1b0-188fe3865e35</a></p>
<p>Not knowing how many of us us have already had mild or asymptomatic COVID, this is a real concern.</p>
<p>“Threlkeld said one way to avoid MIS-A would be to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"This is not a reason, not to get the vaccine. It’s a reason to get the vaccine, because only people who have had the infection have had this occur." Please can someone explain the logic of this statement?</p>
<p>19)  (EDIT)</p>
<p>"Doctors Link Pfizer, Moderna Vaccines to Life-Threatening Blood Disorder: "A second New York Times article quotes doctors who say the mRNA technology used in COVID vaccines may cause immune thrombocytopenia, a blood disorder that last month led to the death of a Florida doctor after his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine":</p>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-moderna-vaccines-life-threatening-blood-disorder/?itm_term=home">https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-moderna-vaccines-life-threatening-blood-disorder/?itm_term=home</a></p>
<p>18)  Pharma does not consider this a vaccine - it is intended as a platform and an operating system.</p>
<p>“Recognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we set out to create an mRNA technology platform that functions very much like an operating system on a computer. It is designed so that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs. In our case, the "program” or “app” is our mRNA drug - the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development">https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development</a></p>
<p>I have yet to read a creepier paragraph. I know Pharma has recently redefined vaccine to incorporate mRNA treatments (much like they have for the words ‘pandemic‘ and the phrase ‘herd immunity‘ to suit their purposes, but this should only highlight their subterfuge.</p>
<p>Is this mRNA gene therapeutic called a vaccine so it can be fraudulently covered under the vaccine liability shield? (see point 11))</p>
<p>17) The fact that they have to bribe us to take this trustworthy, perfectly safe solution to all our troubles:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajherrington/2021/01/14/get-a-free-bag-of-marijuana-with-your-covid-19-vaccine/?sh=f40bb582019a">https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajherrington/2021/01/14/get-a-free-bag-of-marijuana-with-your-covid-19-vaccine/?sh=f40bb582019a</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/brewdog-vaccination-centers">https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/brewdog-vaccination-centers</a></p>
<p>16)  AI needed to help reporting of expected high volume of ADR due to ‘vaccine’:</p>
<p>“The MHRA urgently seeks an Artificial Intelligence (AI) software tool to process the expected high volume of Covid-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs) and ensure that no details from the ADRs’ reaction text are missed”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4258/rr">https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4258/rr</a></p>
<p>15) <strong>Threats to fertility via spike protein effects on the placenta</strong>. Pharma can’t allay these fears, and are open (in their documentation, at least) about their ignorance on this matter. They’ve recently back-pedalled on discouraging pregnant women and women hoping to become pregnant from taking it though. Below you will see the discrepancy between information given to patients and doctors on this issue:</p>

<p>Edit: This from early February 2021:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/raqc2valflg61.png?width=2224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12f4d97c98bd055561f3c2f7fa4d2d49709511d2">Pregnant nurse miscarries mere days after virtue-signalling receipt of mRNA ‘vaccine’. No mention in MSM...</a></p>
<p>14) <strong>Antibody-dependent enhancement or pathogenic priming</strong> - another still-unproven yet undebunked threat. Does the “vaccine” create a greater threat to the immune system from contact with the wild virus? In the FDA documents, “vaccine enhanced disease” is listed as a possible outcome. (See below). The skipped animal trials might have highlighted this issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12725690/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12725690/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEdVZcp7Lbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEdVZcp7Lbc</a></p>
<p>13) <strong>The worrying outcomes in Australia, whereby guinea pigs/ cannon fodder somehow tested positive for HIV.</strong> MSM claims these are false positives, but it does play into fears of autoimmune disasters predicted in FDA’s/ Pfizer’s own documents (see photo below).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-55269381">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-55269381</a></p>
<p>12) <strong>Bell’s Palsy</strong> - cases of this appearing globally. Reported initially by the MSM as temporary (worrying enough) but predictably never followed up by the MSM. How do we know?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9030943/Four-volunteers-got-Pfizers-vaccine-developed-Bells-palsy.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9030943/Four-volunteers-got-Pfizers-vaccine-developed-Bells-palsy.html</a></p>

<p>11) <strong>Pharma has no financial liability for any damage or fatality resultant from their mRNA treatment</strong>. Why should they care about safety, let alone efficacy? No wonder most sensible people are baulking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html</a></p>
<p>10) <strong>The trials skipped crucial steps, such as animal trials, and were only unleashed on the public as a result of governmental fiat emergency powers</strong>. None of these treatments has been officially approved, and experimental substances were permitted to be injected into subjects only via emergency powers acts. Crucial stages have been skipped.</p>

<p>9) <strong>The “authorities” have been very clear that it is only designed to reduce symptoms and not infection transmission</strong>. Masks, social distancing and lockdowns will continue nonetheless, so why bother for a virus with an over 99% recovery rate?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-infectious/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-infectious/</a></p>
<p>from fakesoicansayshit:</p>
<p>“<strong>Covid-19 mRNA vaccine is leaky and can accelerate deaths.</strong></p>
<p>Vaccines are 'perfect' (stops you from getting sick and getting others sick) or 'imperfect/leaky' (reduces symptoms, doesn't stop you from getting others sick). Imperfect vaccines can make viruses spread farther (host doesn't die) and become much deadlier (stronger versions survive).</p>
<p>Don't hang out around vaccinated people, unless you are.”</p>

<p>8) <strong>The fact that we’ll need 2 doses and the cavalier recommendation (in the U.K. at least) that you can mix and match the treatments from different companies to ensure you get both does not promote confidence.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/02/england-health-officials-defend-contingency-plan-to-mix-covid-vaccines">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/02/england-health-officials-defend-contingency-plan-to-mix-covid-vaccines</a></p>
<p>7) Before unleashing the treatments, the FDA published this:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/3hckoe3oflg61.png?width=2224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06220e4e0562303236bdc8c1e41d914180c9f94c</p>
<p>Not exclusively related to mRNA treatments (don’t call them “vaccines”) but if they appear in the lists for adverse effects they have already occurred in the trials.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download</a></p>
<p>6) <strong>Possible permanent, unresearched and unpredictable modifications on human DNA</strong>. However much we hear in the MSM that it doesn’t and can’t affect DNA, many doctors claim otherwise. Changes to RNA messaging for DNA sounds to me like it will have a definite effect.</p>
<p>5) The allergic reactions that started immediately. Aren’t all adverse reactions considered “allergic”? Aren’t all adverse reactions “significant”? Subjects with allergies were being told to hold off from having the “vaccine”. Think those proposed delays have now been removed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/breaking-people-who-suffer-significant-23139049">https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/breaking-people-who-suffer-significant-23139049</a></p>
<p>4) <strong>It’s meagre weeks of trial testing (sometimes lasting 5 days) on predominantly youngish and healthy subjects can tell us little about their safety and efficacy on the elderly and the vulnerable</strong> (yet they’re the first to receive it)</p>
<p>Be cognisant of the fact that the public rollout IS the continuation of the Phase 3 trial. We are the guinea pigs and cannon fodder.</p>
<p>UK authorities explicitly say that under-16s, pregnant women, those with history of allergies (and the elderly) should NOT take the vaccine. Still pushing it on all three though, despite no specific testing at all on these demographics.</p>
<p>"It's not safe for these 3 groups of people to get a COVID-19 vaccine":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2124562485533/its-not-safe-for-these-3-groups-of-people-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine">https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2124562485533/its-not-safe-for-these-3-groups-of-people-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine</a></p>
<p>3) <strong>Almost half of medical professionals are refusing to take it</strong></p>

<p>2) <strong>The medium to long term effects which NOONE can predict</strong> or debunk, due to the insane, headlong rush to “save us” from this “pandemic”. “No time to test, just get it out there“ is apparently the mantra (though I suspect they have been testing these experimental treatments privately for decades...)</p>

<p>"In a new <a href="https://scivisionpub.com/pdfs/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf">research article</a> published in Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases, veteran immunologist J. Bart Classen expresses similar concerns and writes that “RNA-based COVID vaccines have the potential to cause more disease than the epidemic of COVID-19.”</p>
<p>For decades, Classen has published papers exploring how vaccination can give rise to chronic conditions such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12482192/">Type 1</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22934546/">Type 2</a> diabetes — not right away, but three or four years down the road.</p>
<p>In this latest paper, Classen warns that the <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/components-of-mrna-technology-could-lead-to-significant-adverse-events-in-one-or-more-of-our-clinical-trials-says-moderna/">RNA-based vaccine technology</a> could create “new potential mechanisms” of <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/thousands-covid-vaccine-injuries-13-deaths-reported-december/">vaccine adverse events</a> that may take years to come to light.":</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The deaths</strong> throughout the world already. Hundreds already reported but, with the reticence of patients and doctors to report the findings, it’s highly likely to already be significantly higher. That number will of course only rise (329 in the US alone as of 1st Feb 2021 - guarantee we never get a single proper investigation and the stories of individual cases quietly slip down the memory hole...)</li>

        <p>from what I read with prior mRNA testing on animals the problem with that step in the trial is that ALL the animals died - rather convenient they could skip that round of testing on these new "vaccines" huh?</p>

<p>This story comes from a person I know only very slightly, but I still find it very troubling. He is about 19. He got the vaccine and had bad side effects. I don't know what they were, specifically. Two weeks later, his entire family, who he lives with, got covid, and his father is now in an ICU.</p>

        <p>Hey, can you put this up as your #19? This is anecdotal, but my friend took the covid vaccine, and it turned him gay! It's true. I sucked his penis mere moments after he was given his second vaccine to be sure. (btw I was there for an unrelated issue - a routine prostate exam)</p>

        <p>We need less people who get prostate exams? Listen. I can understand being apprehensive about the procedure, but take it from me, it's nothing to be afraid of. It's over very quickly, and the alternative to getting it is that you might miss the signs of a very common type of cancer. And I'm no doomer! I'll be the first to tell you that prostate cancer is very treatable, and the survival rates are high as far as cancer goes. But it's still best to catch it early. </p>

<p>Just look into it is all I'm saying. It's not an exaggeration, just a point of fact, to say that these screenings have saved lives.</p>
