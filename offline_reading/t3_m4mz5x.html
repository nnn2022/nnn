    <strong>Sometimes I wish i was ignorant to learning things...</strong>
    <p><p>It’s sad to see that the people who are open minded and want to learn about a situation such as covid and see through the lies of the government are scared to speak up. On a day to day basis I ask my friends and peers to what they think about the Covid situation and they all respond with the same thing “it will be over soon” or “covid is so scary” without having a clue what’s going on in the back ground and how they see this new dystopian society as normal. I sometimes honestly cry myself to sleep about thinking how idiotic people are and how they are blinded to what the media puts in front of them without doing and type of research to form a personal opinion. This “virus” has really shown that people are the real problem to our world. I’m 18 years old living the everyday for the last year the exact same. I’m tired of this.</p></p>

        <p>I get it man. I really do. I'm in the exact same situation, everyone around me are completely and utterly oblivious to the nefarious schemes at play here. This community has helped lift me out of the despair though because I have realized there are a lot more people than you think who have the same mindset as you do. It's just that we are hidden precisely because of the fear of going against the herd. We're social animals. No one wants to be disliked and shamed for holding a view against the narrative. But at some point we have to decide whether being in line and liked is better than foregoing our future as a free being. I say nothing is more important than the latter. We have to fight to keep our liberties alive and fight we shall. Don't give up hope.</p>

        <p>Try 10 years older twice as tired of this. In fact now I don't know how you could not see what is happening, it's doesn't take a rocket scientist to see there is some very bad people up to some very stuff, and that nothing about this so called pandemic adds up in the least. I can't off the top of my my head think of anything the media and health authorities who seem to be in world domination  contest has said about it besides some accidental truth here and there that nothing in particular is as bad as they're making it out to be that's quickly changed or deep scrubbed from the internet ASAP because people might notice and question what is happening.</p>

        <p>It seems like I’m in your exact situation I can’t say how much more of this I can take. I love my friends and family and I don’t want them to hate me because of thinking this way. I really wish I was how I was years ago. I really am starting to hate this country and I want to leave so bad.</p>
