    <strong>Why are they doing this?</strong>
    <p><p>What is the reason the government or whoever is calling the shots to lockdown the entire population, and make it so people can’t have social lives. I’m just confused, I get that governments like control but how does this benefit them? Surely it was easier for them before when most people just ignored them and went about their business but now they must have a growing population that is against them. I don’t understand.</p></p>

<p>Something a lot of people are forgetting is who is getting the biggest benefit out of this. Follow the money.</p>
<p>Remember, you neighborhood convenience store has been forced to close off for months and it's currently in bankruptcy because it spreads evil viruses. Truly aware people only order online, going outside is scary and for selfish people only.</p>

        <p>It is a hostile take over of life. The elite running the show want to force humans to give up their free will and connection to our humanity so we can be physical and mental slaves and our energy/ingenuity can be harvested to provide sustenance for those really in control.</p>

        <p>There may be varying reasons and I'm sure many of the regional leaders are just useful idiots who has no idea what's going on, they just follow orders from WHO and UN thinking it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p>As for the top, they already have money. Both stored and a stable income from loan interest, bank fees, M$ subscriptions etc etc.. They don't want or need more money. </p>
<p>But, a constantly growing middle class means the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less space to build a fancy mansion near the coast line, without getting disturbed by noisy neighbours</li>
<li>Too much traffic on the road to enjoy your fancy luxury car</li>
<li>Too much air and boat traffic, so you'll have to wait all the time when traveling</li>
<li>Noisy small boats and middle class tourists enjoying nature, no matter where you hike there's always other people around</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, just look at the NWO plans, they clearly wanna erase the middle class, making everyone stay at home all the time while living in high density cities. Those who work could work as servants for the rich elite, but I'm guessing they prefer being served by robots, just to avoid having to deal with poor people.</p>
<p>And is there a better way to reach those goals then making a plandemic, forcing people to stay home, or more accurate scare people enough to stay home "volounterly"?</p>
<p>Try to imagine a world where everyone is rich, that would be a nightmare for the elite and they're probably expecting that type of development considering how more people also means a growing middle class. It's all about control and has little to do with money.</p>
