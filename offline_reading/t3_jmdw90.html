        <p>I found another source to what you are talking about. </p>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/gates-global-empire-threatens-life/">Bill Gates 'Web of Power"</a></p>
<p>In her introduction to the report, Navdanya International’s founder, Vandana Shiva, said:</p>
<p>“The European Court of Justice has ruled that gene-edited organisms are GMOs. However, Gates is hastily pushing for deregulation with no regard for caution or potentially dangerous consequences. His ‘Gates AgOne’ … initiative is a clear declaration of his intent to create an Empire over life and biodiversity, over food and farming, and over our daily bread.”</p>
<p>With a net worth of nearly 17 billion Gates is now the most powerful philanthropist in modern history... So he thinks he can play with the Human race at his whim? Scary thought really.</p>

        <p>The report gathers evidence and throws light on the dangers of philanthrocapitalism, which is boosting the corporate takeover of our seed, agriculture, food, knowledge and global health systems, manipulating information and eroding our democracies.  Over the last 30 years it has emerged as a major force, able to derail the international agenda and push our future and the future of our planet towards extinction and ecological collapse.</p>
<p>Throughout the   report, we see how the patterns of technocratic solutionism, powered by an unholy alliance between big-capital, science and technology institutions and states, are embodied by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and  put into accelerated action through philanthropic development. Through its various initiatives, sub-organizations, development schemes and funding mechanisms, the Gates weave an intricate web of wide-ranging power and influence, obscured through all its separate strands. The report addresses a large part of this web of power. A power which deliberately ignores the past failures of the very technologies they wish to push, and which disregards any potential problem their initiatives might yield, power focused primarily on profit and market expansion.</p>
<p>This democratic emergency is analysed in detail by leading experts and civil society movements’ leaders, such as Vandana Shiva, Farida Akhter, José Esquinas Alcàzar, Nicoletta Dentico, Fernando Cabaleiro, Seth Itzkan, Dru Jay, Satish Kumar, Jonathan Latham, Aidé Jiménez-Martínez, Chito Medina, Zahra Moloo, Silvia Ribeiro, Adelita San Vicente, Ali Tapsoba, Jim Thomas, Timothy A. Wise. The report counts on the participation of international organisations and national movements, such as ETC Group, Community Alliance for Global Justice/AGRA Watch, Soil4Climate, Bioscience Resource, GM Watch, Naturaleza de Derechos – Argentina, Masipag – Philippines, Terre à Vie – Burkina Faso, UBINIG – Bangladesh.</p>
