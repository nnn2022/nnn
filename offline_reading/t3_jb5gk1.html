    <strong>Why the hell is Bill Gates at the center of all this all the time? His foundation has paid millions to go profit media for basically infomercials on his interests</strong>
    <p><p>He is giving millions to even for-profit media companies to put him at the center of attention all the time.  It's his bias that is driving all this.  No wonder The Guardian has come out strongly.against the Great Barrington Declaration, he's paid them millions.  They accept it probably because they are going broke due to online competition.</p>
<p>&rt;I recently examined nearly twenty thousand charitable grants the Gates Foundation had made through the end of June and found more than $250 million going toward journalism. Recipients included news operations like the BBC, NBC, Al Jazeera, ProPublica, National Journal, The Guardian, Univision, Medium, the Financial Times, The Atlantic, the Texas Tribune, Gannett, Washington Monthly, Le Monde, and the Center for Investigative Reporting; charitable organizations affiliated with news outlets, like BBC Media Action and the New York Times’</p>

<p>considering he was a very public cheerleader for depopulation and now he wants to "save" everyone with an injection, I think we  can guess why he is giggling and all giddy in those puff piece interviews.</p>

<p>&rt;AstraZeneca also received $750 million from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, an organization the Gates Foundation helped set up and continues to fund to this day. Despite questions on the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine, governments worldwide have already bought it, on the taxpayers dime.</p>
<p>&rt;Also notable is the Gates Foundation’s grants, totaling $20 million, to Moderna, whose vaccine has also been described as a COVID-19 frontrunner. The foundation has a “global health project framework agreement” with the company, agreeing to give it up to $100 million to develop its mRNA technology, in exchange for receiving “certain non-exclusive licenses,” which have yet to be publicly specified.</p>
<p>&rt;Even with all this, Gates doesn’t publicly disclose his conflicts of interest when appearing on TV as an expert on COVID-19. And, as The Nation reports, when Gates wrote an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, <strong>he simply listed his conflicts of interest as “numerous.”</strong> <strong>According to Forbes, Gates has seen his personal net worth increase by more than $10 billion since the onset of the pandemic.</strong></p>

        <p>And governments fork over billions to his foundations. Canada just gave another half billion to Covax. Largest transfer of wealth in history is happening while we're slowly converted to a cashless society.</p>

        <p>My Family and I lived in washington. we all moved to Idaho during Lockdown.
Among many many other affiliations Bill Gates has, Jay Inslees daughter works for him.
This man has a vision of the NWO
He is an expert on matters because he pays to be and he is not the only one.
My family and I call him God, because everytime he speaks, you know that God has a plan for you.</p>
