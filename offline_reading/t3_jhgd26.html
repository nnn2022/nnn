        <p>TL;DR, but I hope some of you find this interesting...</p>
<p>How we got here, is both easy to explain, and complicated. I'll take a stab at this, in some sort of chronological order (US-centric, but but general principles apply in Canada, UK, Australia, NZ, etc):</p>
<p><strong>1800's:</strong></p>
<p>- Rise of Prussian style education systems, with emphasis on obedience, conformity, and rote memorization.</p>
<p>- Rise of "Big Government" - the beginnings of environmentalism, "Public Health" tyranny. the dole, judicial activism.</p>
<p>- The rise of a global, unaccountable class of uber-wealthy (see Rockefeller, JP Morgan, etc), who had no loyalty to their countries of origin. The rise of monopolies and "crony capitalism".</p>
<p><strong>1900's</strong>:</p>
<p>- The introduction of fiat currency and the growth of stock markets. The massive growth in power of nationalized banks, and international financial cartels.</p>
<p>- The use of "proxies" to destroy opponents - "Lenin and the train", Bolshevik attempts to spread international revolution, US meddling in Central/South America, etc. Often funded by the elites discussed earlier, for their own ends.</p>
<p>- New Deal economics - massive government intervention in national economies, which insinuated government into ever-more spheres of life. Nationalizations, picking "winners and losers" in the economic arena based on government largesse.</p>
<p>- The failure to crush Communism, either in it's cradle in 1917, or post WWII, when Stalin was allowed to swallow half of Europe. See also China, Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>- Post fall of the Berlin Wall, failure to have a "Nuremberg Trial" to hold Communists responsible and accountable for their crimes, including agents, agitators, and "fellow travellers" in the West. They were allowed to slither away into the environmental and  "social justice" movements.</p>
<p><strong>2000's to today</strong> - failure to address the ills discussed previously, from which all of our miseries stem:</p>
<p>- Failure to bring the globalist elites to heel.</p>
<p>- Failure to protect the education system from leftist infiltration and maintain the growth of critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>- Failure to stop the runaway train of government entitlements and use of them as a weapon and path to harvest votes.</p>
<p>- Failure to recognize the environmental and social justice movements are simply old Communists doing new tricks. Allowing them to take over media, academia, the judiciary, and the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>- Failure to stop the growth of "big government".</p>
<p>- Failure to recognize the crises we face today stem from more than a century of interconnected events and policies and have been created, deliberately, to further tyranny. The 'Rona is but one aspect of this.</p>

        <p>Really good post man. Excellent. I've covered a lot of this in some of the videos I've done. I recommend James Perloff's The Shadows of Power on how the Council on Foreign Relations has had a hand in all of this too.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the compliment!</p>
<p>There is so much I wanted to expand upon and go deeper, but I wanted to keep the post at a readable length.</p>
<p>My hope is always that if people see the broad strokes and start to question what is going on in our society, they will dig deeper - and start encouraging others to ask "WTF is going on here?"</p>
