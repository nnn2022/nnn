    <strong>An Immunologists Response to Dangerous Vaccine Effects in Autopsies Video...</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of us have watched this video of a scientist who shows us the supposed effects of the vaccine in autopsies, here's the link if you wish to see it once more.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/p0o1o7/scientist_shows_vaccine_effects_in_autopsies_dont/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Post LINK</a> </p>
<p>Like many others on that post, I wanted to here someone's refutes to the remarks made in the video. On another post relating to vaccines, I saw a user, u/VichelleMassage, who claimed to be an Immunologist. I hit up said person to see their viewpoints on what was stated in the video and they had some things to say. I hope that this doesn't break any of the rules of this subreddit, I think its important to hear both sides of the argument and to make sure that we all get the best possible information whether they be pro-covidvax or anti-covidvax.</p>
<p>Here's the replies that was given to (none of the responses have been altered and are simple copy and pastes):</p>
<p>&rt;Hi</p>
<p>&rt;So I started taking a look</p>
<p>&rt;But my first step when looking at a sensationalist doctor/scientist is check their credibility.</p>
<p>&rt;You can see the White Coat Summit: America's Frontline Doctors watermark on the video</p>
<p>&rt;I looked them up, and they have been pushing hydroxychloriquine and ivermectin</p>
<p>&rt;neither of which have any clinical evidence of efficacy and are actively harming patients who don't see out medical attention while self-medicating AND taking meds from people who need them for their intended indications</p>
<p>&rt;Cole's credentials are legit, and he is board certified. But that has never stopped quack docs like Dr. Oz (who is also board certified)</p>
<p>&rt;He also casually drops "PhD research in immunology" but he never acquired a PhD. So... that's a red flag.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm checking the sources on the actual papers he cites in the talks now.</p>
<p>&rt;This will take longer</p>
<p>&rt;So... None of the figures he shows in his slides are properly labeled or cited from literature.</p>
<p>&rt;You can't tell if someone just took some random pictures and said this one is X and this one is Y</p>
<p>&rt;he doesn't even tell what kind of stains he was using</p>
<p>&rt;The one paper he did cite is from Nature Neuroscience which showed spike protein crossing the blood brain barrier</p>
<p>&rt;Which could be a possibility, given the COVID fog symptoms, but this was in mice in a direct dosage to the brain (via intranasal instillation, meaning right in the nose near the brain)</p>
<p>&rt;I couldn't tell whether the dosage was high or low from their methods, and they never did a dose curve (meaning testing how different dosages affect the results) or if they reflect what happens in humans with the vaccine or live infection</p>
<p>&rt;But that doesn't automatically mean inflammation.</p>
<p>&rt;Inflammation is complex.</p>
<p>&rt;The COVID spike protein DOES elicit an immune response, meaning it's immunogenic. That's part of why it was chosen: 1) because if it's targeted by your antibodies, it stops virus from entering the cell and 2) it doesn't require an adjuvant to help boost the immune response. (which is what anti-vaxxers were worried about with the ethyl-mercury thimerosal and aluminum)</p>
<p>&rt;But that alone doesn't mean you'll get the kind of damage that sick patients get</p>
<p>&rt;Viruses also have other pieces that trigger different sensors</p>
<p>&rt;the combination of those sensors causes alarms to go off</p>
<p>&rt;The serious symptoms that you see in COVID patients isn't due to the virus killing all your cells</p>
<p>&rt;It's from your immune system going nuts</p>
<p>&rt;Or at least, the viral damage is probably not the biggest contributor.</p>
<p>&rt;So, although people usually experience flu-like symptoms the first 24-36 hours after vaccination, it stops soon after, even when spike protein is still being produced</p>
<p>&rt;meaning that the immune system has determined the threat isn't an all-hands-on-deck situation</p>
<p>&rt;All this to say, even if the spike protein crosses the blood brain barrier, it doesn't mean it will cause massive inflammation or COVID fog like we see in infections.</p>
<p>&rt;1.21 Billion people have been fully vaccinated</p>
<p>&rt;We would have seen people experiencing serious COVID-like symptoms by now in similar numbers</p>
<p>&rt;We would have seen people experiencing serious COVID-like symptoms by now in similar numbers</p>
<p>&rt;The other red flag is that he calls the spike protein a "toxin"</p>
<p>&rt;It is definitely not a toxin.</p>
<p>&rt;Most toxins fall under the 'exotoxin' umbrella which are usually proteins that actively harm your cells to help a microbe infect you</p>
<p>&rt;The only other being endotoxins, like LPS, the thing that causes toxic shock syndrome</p>
<p>&rt;But that, even in teeny tiny amounts can cause you to go into anaphylactic shock</p>
<p>&rt;whereas you can inject much more spike protein and be fine.</p>
<p>&rt;This guy has no quantifiable evidence</p>
<p>&rt;He's just pointing to images and saying "trust me, this side is COVID-vaccine, and it's worse than the other picture</p>
<p>&rt;which is unvaccinated"</p>
<p>&rt;Without any kind of peer review, and especially without proper labeling, I would not put much trust in any scientific presentation like that</p>
<p>&rt;As far as I could tell, he didn't tell where the tissues came from or explain why the patients died.</p>
<p>&rt;Presumably he operates under the assumption that they died from the vaccine? But if someone died of a heart attack, guess what? they're gonna have pericardium inflammation like in his picture. If they died of a stroke, guess what? brain damage.</p>
<p>&rt;The one thing he does talk about is viral reactivation of dormant diseases like chickenpox and mono</p>
<p>&rt;And there seem to be case studies of this happening and in a few trials of people with rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune disease)</p>
<p>&rt;So that could very well be an adverse effect.</p>
<p>&rt;Similar to the blood clots from the non-mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt;But there isn't enough clinical and epidemiological data to back that up.</p>
<p>&rt;Oh, also, I read a little more on ivermectin, and there are some promising results from a review. HOWEVER, it has not been formally tested in a large clinical trial.</p>
<p>&rt;So to make that recommendation before it's been tested is really bad medicine.</p>
<p>&rt;It's like how you hear there's a miracle cancer drug that works 95% of the time in mice and never makes past Phase I clinical trials, but you decided to recommend it to people anyway.</p>
<p>&rt;Anyway, that is my assessment.</p>
<p>&rt;There is a lot of suspicious and red-flaggy stuff going on.</p>
<p>&rt;You can't say for sure it's wrong, but I think most clinicians and scientists would not trust this presentation based on this data alone.</p>
<p>&rt;Hope that helps!</p>
<p>(My response thanking user and asking for permission to post these messages)</p>
<p>&rt;(User Agreeing)</p>
<p>&rt;As I re-read my blurbs, I'm realizing they were very stream-of-conscious late at night lol. So two other things I want to point to are: 1) the reason why I mention the credibility and the pushing HCQ/Ivermectin is because people who refute accepted medical consensus oftentimes have a "great alternative" that will solve your problem and will in some way monetarily benefit them and 2) the importance of the labeling and sourcing of samples is that without knowing how they were acquired or having proper positive/negative controls, how are we supposed to make fair comparisons? So even if the stains show more blue, how do we know that that's bad? Compared to what? It also doesn't prove causation. An n of 1 is hardly enough evidence to come to any meaningful conclusion</p>
<p>So this is what I got, what do you guys think? Either way its good to hear both sides on something like this. Oh and please don't target and harass the user, that's not cool.</p></p>

        <p>The claims of Ivermectin being harmful are easily refuted by a simple Google search. </p>
<p>Ivermectin is safe for humans and has been successfully used to treat parasitic worm diseases in all countries for many years now. </p>
<p>The creators of Ivermectin have received a Nobel prize for creating a cheap, safe and effective treatment for a common disease. </p>
<p>It's included in the WHO list of essential medicines. </p>
<p>The side effects in humans are so rare, that it's safe to take it even in cases where the diagnosis is unclear.</p>

<p>I think a lot of the kneejerk "ivermectin is dangerous!1!" response is from westerners who had never heard of it before so they think it's some obscure new drug with no track record of safety instead of something with decades of use and that's no more dangerous to the average person than Tylenol.</p>

<p>Did he ask himself how much money they are making by pushing existing drugs, versus how much money is being made by pushing novel approaches? I can't help but think that if there is no money to be made, then the only reasonable reason to push existing drugs is that there actually is evidence that they work.</p>
<p>I don't have time to read the rest; sorry.</p>

        <p>"claimed to be an immunologist" then bashes someone else's credentials in the first few sentences. No thanks. This person is just looking for reasons to discount someone else's knowledge. Saying you are doing PhD research in immunology when you already have an MD, is perfectly acceptable and shouldn't be a factor. If they stuck with the information and data only, I might listen. Plenty of people don't have PhD's and contribute a lot to science and the world in general. It's people with this mindset being in powerful positions that are keeping information from being shared and investigated properly.</p>
