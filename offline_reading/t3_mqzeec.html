<p>At 3:47 is when it gets weird.  After already dishonestly framing "vaccine hesitancy" as an issue about vaccines in general as opposed to this experimental biological agent, the host lies further by suggesting that hesitancy stems from dangerous talk by people in media like Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p>He tells Mr. Fauci that he prefers to read a Tucker Carlson quote rather than play a clip of Tucker because <strong>"I'm not sure that helps the cause..."</strong>  <strong>He begins shuddering and says, "...here of of of of savings lives."</strong>  It is as if there is a <em>private cause</em> to destroy western civilization, and he wants Mr. Fauci to know that he is speaking about the <em>public cause</em> of pretend-saving lives, so that they are on the same page.</p>
<p>The host shows and reads the first part of the quote, <strong>"If the vaccine is effective, there is no reason for people who have received the vaccine to wear..."</strong></p>
<p>Then, he shows and reads the second half, leaving only this portion on the screen.  The host reads the last sentence a second time.  <strong>"...masks or avoid physical contact.  So, maybe it doesn't work and they're simply not telling you that."</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Fauci deliberately ignores the question of why a vaccinated person needs to wear a mask or antisocial distance themselves from others.  He dismisses the idea that the vaccine doesn't work as a "conspiracy theory."</p>
<p>Looks like he is the one involved in a "conspiracy" to evade basic and obvious questions regarding all the contradictory nonsense that he himself says on television.</p></p>

        <p>I notice that Fauci didn't answer why we should wear a mask if the vaccine works. He instead turned it into a how dare Tucker question the vaccine efficacy. Fauci is nothing more than a propagandist tool.</p>
<p>As a side note, I'm no fan of Tucker but he did raise a valid question.</p>

        <p>They say you can't judge a book by its cover, but I think people who read enough become well versed in doing exactly that. In other words, you can tell just by looking at Fauci that he's a lying piece of shit.</p>

        <p>Tucker Carlson's "why should vaccinated people wear masks?" question was a drug company talking point, I can't believe people are falling for it.</p>
<p>He's planting the idea that unvaccinated people should wear masks, while vaccinated people don't need to. That's probably what they're going to do, there's already a precedent with nurses and the flu vaccine. They're going to use masks as a way to coerce vaccination.</p>
<p>Nobody should be wearing filthy, breath stifling face diapers, vaccinated or otherwise.</p>

        <p>Sadly, it’s not “probably” what they are going to do, it is what they are doing. My friend, who is a Covid rule follower spilled some interesting details over lunch the other day. Her husband’s job was in discussions about mandating the vaccines. She explained that he spoke up(as a fairly high ranked employee) suggesting they encourage vaccines not mandate them. His idea to encourage them was to explain to their factory employees that if the got vaccinated they would no longer have to wear a mask in the already hot and hard to breathe environment. The company instead decided to mandate. But then she went on to tell me her company chose the persuasion method. The boss called her into the office, and in a legally allowed round about way asked her whether she was or would be vaccinated. Then proceeded to tell her about the perks involved with vaccination. The first one being that she wouldn’t have to wear a mask at her desk any longer.</p>
