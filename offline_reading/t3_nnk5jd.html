        <p>I get my information from the mainstream media. </p>
<p>The information they've provided is plenty enough for anyone with a modicum of reason to conclude the whole threat of Covid is bullshit. </p>
<p>The numbers indicate it isn't a real threat. </p>
<p>And this is after they've told us they're inflating the numbers. </p>
<p>They openly admit the vaccine is ineffective against receiving or transmitting the virus. </p>
<p>They aren't shy about censorship and deplatforming anyone who even questions their narrative.</p>
<p>It really takes very little thought or situational awareness to figure out that it's a lie. Those still touting masks and lockdowns all fall into one of three categories. </p>
<p>Dumb, dishonest, or mentally ill.</p>

        <p>Reading studies, the science articles on how the delivery mechanisms work, how the mRNA works, how spike proteins work, how PCR tests work, how previous attempts at SARS vaccines went, how T-cells work, how cross-reactivity works, how long natural immunity lasts. It's a deep rabbit hole, but once you've studied up you won't really want to jump out and get these "vaccines".</p>
<p>Only information I get from the MSM is what they have planned next, the current narrative, and how the trends may be shifting. Any of their fearmongering is met with intense skepticism.</p>

        <p>Most of my family got covid and they all said it ranged from bad cold to mild flu with my sister losing her smell for 2 months. She said it was a joke. My family keeps pretty healthy so they knocked it out in a few days. No one I know died from it.

        <p>It's a mix of community. Some go to fringe websites, some CDC some MSM.</p>
<p>I trust CNN (The most trusted name in news ). Do you trust CNN?</p>
<p>Here are some CNN articles I find trustworthy:</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>‚Äú(CNN) THE TIMETABLE FOR A CORONAVIRUS VACCINE IS 18 MONTHS. EXPERTS SAY THAT'S RISKY.‚Äù,</strong> Robert Kuznia, April 1, 2020, ‚ÄúEighteen months might sound like a long time, but in vaccine years, it's a blink. That's the long end of the Trump administration's time window for developing a coronavirus vaccine, and some <strong>leaders in the field say this is too fast -- and could come at the expense of safety.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Dr. Emily Erbelding, an infectious disease expert at NIAID -- which is part of the National Institutes of Health -- said the typical vaccine takes between eight and 10 years to develop. While she is careful not to contradict her boss's timeline -- although she did say <strong>"18 months would be about as fast as I think we can go" -- she acknowledged that the accelerated pace will involve "not looking at all the [safety] data."</strong> </p>
<p>Volunteers in each phase need to be monitored for safety, Erbelding said. <strong>"Usually, you want to follow their immune response for at least a year,"</strong> she said. <strong>But that is not what will be happening</strong> in the current study in Seattle and Atlanta, where researchers will test animals and humans in parallel, as opposed to sequentially, according to Stat, a health news website produced by Boston Globe Media.</p>
<p>Fauci, who did not respond to a request for comment for this story, acknowledged the importance of safety in his March 26 remarks. <strong>"The worst possible thing you do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse," he said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[V]accine history is dotted with devastating failures, in which people who got a dose fared far worse than they would have without it.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies programme, said testing new vaccines takes time. <strong>"Many people are asking, 'Well why do we have to test the vaccines? Why don't we just make the vaccines and give them to people?' Well the world has learned many lessons in the mass use of vaccines and there's only one thing more dangerous than a bad virus, and that's a bad vaccine," Ryan said. "We have to be very, very, very careful in developing any product that we're going to inject into potentially most of the world population."</strong></p>

<p><strong>PAST VACCINE DISASTERS SHOW WHY RUSHING A CORONAVIRUS VACCINE NOW WOULD BE 'COLOSSALLY STUPID'.</strong></p>
<p>(CNN) <strong>Vaccine experts are warning the federal government against rushing out a coronavirus vaccine before testing has shown it's both safe and effective. Decades of history show why they're right.</strong> September 1, 2020</p>
<hr>
<p>Their concern that <strong>the FDA may be moving too quickly heightened when FDA Commissioner Dr. Steven Hahn told the Financial Times that his agency could consider an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a Covid-19 vaccine before late stage clinical trials are complete if the data show strong enough evidence it would protect people. Otherwise, vaccines have had to go through the entire clinical trial process and FDA approval process, which can take months or years.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>When the vaccine making process has been rushed, there have been bad outcomes.</strong></p>
<p>Markel said people's mistrust of the system makes <strong>the idea that the FDA would rush this process before late stage clinical trials are complete "colossally stupid."</strong> "This is one of the most ridiculous things I've heard this administration say," Markel said. "All it takes is one bad side effect to basically botch a vaccine program that we desperately need against this virus. **It's a prescription for disaster."</p>
<p><strong>"This could do substantial damage,"</strong> Kinch said. Kinch, who is a patient in one of the vaccine trials himself, said the clinical trial process needs to be followed to the end. A too-early EUA for a vaccine could cause a "nightmare scenario," for a few reasons.</p>
<p><strong>One, the vaccine may not be safe. Two, if it is not safe, people will lose faith in vaccines. Three, if a vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, people will have a false sense of security and increase their risk. Four, if a substandard vaccine gets an EUA, a better vaccine may never get approval, because people would be reluctant to enroll in trials and risk getting a placebo instead of a vaccine. "People are going to die unnecessarily if we take chances with this," Kinch said. "We've got to get this right."</strong>
