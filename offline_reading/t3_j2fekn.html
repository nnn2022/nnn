        <p>That could be a valid arguement if they did protect others and did it beyond a certain threshold and were no downsides. I know its tempting to compare Covid to the flu in every way, but there are differences, youve misimagined covids affect on children and young people, who luckily are not affected by this the way they are flus. My compassion is based on suffering and how you treat people, and i simply cant treat others as horribly as people like you are comfortable with</p>

        <p>Naked: on so many levels that is very false and stupid comparison you guys use. The vast majority of societies all over the world wore clothing, we assume by their own consent, as when they learned how to skin animals and tan hides. This is a universal societal norm dating back hundreds of thousands of years, not forced. The laws are there to back up what society has decided by common precident, and even then there are legal public nudist colonies and beachs and of course private nude gathering were allowed. The only weak comparison I can think of is the way some Muslim countries force veil and restrict movement of women in order to protect both society and the women, and in some cases those laws happened very quickly and were enforced like masks are now. </p>
<p>You do not affect anyone by wearing a mask, and you are, and have been before this, free to do so; in a civil democratic society we should not dictate what clothing people wear, or forcably remove clothing.</p>

        <p>Also, the negatives of dealing with a mask improperly that could affect society, like transfer of bacteria and viral fomites, etc, I accept as part of what comes with humanity and not micromanaging a person's body.</p>
<p>If you think a vulnerable loved one will be 'saved' by mask wearing, you need to come to terms with the reality of life, death and illness, because it wont work, and you cant blame self, friends, government, family or society.</p>

<p>First, I wear a mask around everyone, not just loved ones.</p>
<p>Second, I never said it would 100% save them. I think it is just a simple step 99.9% of people can take that can make infection rates go down, like washing your hands</p>
<p>If you can't understand why someone might take basic preventative measures (and why private businesses may enforce said measures), then I feel sorry for ypu.</p>

        <p>My point still stands, wearing clothes is still forced to everyone at least in the general public spaces in the US, yes there are some specific places you can be naked, and some countries don't force you to wear anything even in public, and that's basically what happens with masks. </p>
<p>&rt;You do not affect anyone by wearing a mask, and you are, and have been before this, free to do so; in a civil democratic society we should not dictate what clothing people wear, or forcably remove clothing.</p>
<p>Then I don't see how I'm being selfish.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I don't think forcing people to wear masks (or clothing for that matter) just because they are outside is right, forcing them to wear in places where social distancing isn't expected is ok imo.</p>

        <p>Being a societal norm doesn't make it right tho. We are still forcing people to do something without a bigger reason other than, it was always like this.</p>
<p>Scientific evidence indicates that masks can mitigate the spread of the virus, so if social distancing isn't at all possible you should wear it, otherwise you can just social distance and not wear it. Trying to prevent the spread of a virus isn't being selfish.</p>

<p>Is very important to what exactly? A person not wearing clothes, isn't harmful to anyone.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 5 studies, that prove that the use of a face mask can be an effective way of reducing the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0016018</p>

<p>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0376</p>
<p>I have many more papers, including studies, analysis and reviews if you want to see those. As you can see there are huge amounts of data that support it.</p>
<p>One thing is clear the possible disadvantages of wearing a mask pail in comparison with the possible advantages.</p>

        <p>'rightness'/clothes : u are missing the point by miles; because it is the agreement of society dating back to documented beginning of civilization. </p>
<p>It is likely that I have already read the others also, I have read many studies, and I have my own list saying they dont work or have side effects. It can be clearly demonstrated that they dont work, that many people have serious problems with them, and real data shows they dont work. Studies "supporting" it have to be good studies, not just the researcher saying 'everybody wear masks'. Just as an example, fluid dynamics used to be a field of science that has been rendered obsolete by Covid. I have not seen a pro mask study that wasnt flawed, and I am not alone in that. As others have said, there is also the matter of whether something should be forced no matter what the effect is. In addition to societal norms, alcohol is killing people, transportation kills even when used as intended, they are not banned.  </p>
<p>And no, <em>possible</em> advantages as you yourself admit, do not pale in comparison to the real documented suffering of others.</p>

<p>An agreement? Why do we have to force everyone to participate in that agreement? Just because of tradition?</p>
<p>&rt;saying they dont work or have side effects. It can be clearly demonstrated that they dont work, that many people have serious problems with them, and real data shows they dont work.</p>
<p>Could you provide those studies? I have never seen one that claims masks have serious side effects, at most they do nothing.</p>
<p>&rt;I have not seen a pro mask study that wasnt flawed,</p>
<p>I missed any obvious flaw on the studies I sent, care to point out what where they? I can send you more studies if you'd like.</p>
<p>&rt;And no, possible advantages as you yourself admit, do not pale in comparison to the real documented suffering of others.</p>
<p>I said that even if those advantages don't exist I simply don't see what those huge disadvantages are.  I haven't seen real documented suffering due exclusively to people using masks, what are this huge side effects you are talking about?</p>
<p>Sure I believe there might be one ore other edge cases where people can't wear a mask, but for the far majority of people it won't be a problem at all.</p>

        <p>Which brings me to my next point:</p>
<p>Even if masks work as intended, they aren't necessary. They don't significantly increase quality of life or decrease years of life lost. This virus doesn't kill young healthy individuals, most deaths or long-term complications are in the elderly and chronically/terminally ill. People who would die relatively soon with or without COVID.</p>

        <p>You find high risk group deaths negligible because young healthy dudes like yourself lack compassion towards strangers. If hypothetically someone you loved got really sick, you wouldn't show up in the hospital without a mask and argue that even if you infected them with COVID, they'd die relatively soon regardless. You're not the grim reaper to decide when to put an end to someone just because your face feels funny with a mask on.</p>

        <p>Deaths in high risk groups are negligible because they already have a lower life expectancy. When elderly/infirm individuals die, less years of life are lost than when young otherwise-healthy individuals die. Compassion has very little to do with it, as you too lack compassion for strangers; humans are only truly capable of genuine compassion for a dozen to maybe a few hundred close social contacts, and so-called "compassion" for thousands, millions, billions of others is only a thin, shallow, hollow shell of the compassion we feel toward our close family and friends. That said, I wouldn't visit a loved one in a hospital for any reason, except perhaps to bring them home. If they are going to die soon, they deserve to die with dignity in the comfort of their own home instead of withering away in a cold unfeeling government/corporate institution.</p>

        <p>It could be argued that cancer is overtreated and we shouldn't bother trying to "beat" it, especially considering how many chemotherapy agents simply trade one kind of cancer for another down the line. So many substances and lifestyle choices are carcinogenic that cancer is possibly the worst example of an illness worth treating or preventing. If you were so compassionate, you would value dignified end of life care over extending life indefinitely.</p>

        <p>It isn't up to us to decide whether someone goes through treatments for more difficult diseases. It's their choice. I've had a close friend have cancer in his teens and now, a decade later, he's got a film school degree and is producing his own movies. He's working his dream job, living his dream life.</p>
<p>Man, you're free to have your own views on mortality. But others are free to have their own. And through your actions, you're indirectly removing their choice.</p>

        <p>I'm not deciding anything for anyone, they have the right to take their own precautions. It isn't my job to protect a total stranger, and whatever precautions I take - or don't take - to protect a loved one is between me and them. If I'm "indirectly" removing someone's choice to not catch a cold by not wearing a mask, your insistence that I wear a mask is "indirectly" removing my choice to not trip and fall because a mask disrupts my peripheral vision.</p>

        <p>Which brings me to my next point:</p>
<p>Even if masks work as intended, they aren't necessary. They don't significantly increase quality of life or decrease years of life lost. This virus doesn't kill young healthy individuals, most deaths or long-term complications are in the elderly and chronically/terminally ill. People who would die relatively soon with or without COVID.</p>
