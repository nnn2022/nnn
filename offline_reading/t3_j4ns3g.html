<title>How NYC has taken the arbitrary, malicious and dishonest mandates laying down with no pushback only STRENGTHENS my ANTI-IMMIGRATION stance. I reckon that the only resistance is from red blooded Americans who fought and suffered here and have much to lose. I am not a conservative BTW</title>

        <p>Dude, visit Mexican neighborhoods.  No fucks given.</p>
<p>Mexican immigrants and their descendants are usually American as fuck.  They work hard, don't complain, and think whining safety nazi's are stupid.  They're like the Italians from the early 1900s.  Legal Mexican immigrants are badass.</p>
<p>It's almost exclusively upper middle class and rich white people driving this shit.</p>

        <p>Yeah basically. Most Indian owned places I been to dont care. When I spoke to them theyre like "well theres lots of viruses in India."

        <p>Immigrants know the difference between danger and normal risk.  They left <em>everything</em> to make a better life in a new country.  They aren't willing to sacrifice that new life on the off chance they catch a survivable virus.</p>
<p>I talked to the foreman replacing my roof a few years ago.  He was bragging about how his son got into college and how he was working extra jobs on the side to pay for it (in Texas heat, on roofs).  His attitude was that his family came first.  Immigrant from Argentina.  Solid guy.  I guarantee he's disgusted at what we've done.</p>

        <p>Going to disagree. Most people pushing this are upper class white people. The sane people of that group picked up and left in the summer. Any majority immigrant neighborhood, at least in my experience, does not give a shit.</p>

        <p>I have to disagree with this. I live close to NYC and most people I know in the area are born Americans. They support lockdowns with no push back because it aligns with their political views and personal beliefs. </p>
<p>My husband is an immigrant and is 100% against lockdowns. We frequently visit a store in NYC that sells goods from his home country. That store doesn't enforce any covid guidelines,  but I've also never seen many (if any) Americans in there. </p>
<p>I dont think immigrants are the problem, just peoples collective beliefs as a whole regardless of where they're from.</p>

        <p>Eh Im actually conservative and I don’t agree with this. The issue here is that immigrants, unless they’re full citizens, have a lot to lose if they speak up and try to retaliate. All the born and bred American citizens who could leave NYC have done so and essentially voted with their feet. And anyone who is not done with the immigration process or is here undocumented is almost certainly still living better in a shitty NYC than they were in the country they came from.</p>

        <p>You just realized you are a civic nationalist. Being an immigrant isn't an issue it's more of the frame of mind. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism</a></p>
<p>Nationalism is an idea and movement that promotes the interests of a particular nation (as in a group of people),[1] especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining the nation's sovereignty (self-governance) over its homeland. Nationalism holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference (self-determination), that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity[2] and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power (popular sovereignty).[1][3] It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity, based on shared social characteristics of culture, ethnicity, geographic location, language, politics (or the government), religion, traditions and belief in a shared singular history,[4][5] and to promote national unity or solidarity.[1]  Nationalism seeks to preserve and foster a nation's traditional  cultures and cultural revivals have been associated with nationalist  movements.[6] It also encourages pride in national achievements and is closely linked to patriotism.[7][8][page needed] Nationalism is often combined with other ideologies such as conservatism (national conservatism) or socialism (left-wing nationalism).[2]</p>

        <p>I have to agree with this actually. In NYC it is surprising who are complying with the masks and this post is accurate. In addition, the people who you would think are anti authority and would rebel - like heavily tattooed and goths are complying as well</p>
