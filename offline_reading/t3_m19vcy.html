    <strong>The fear mongering needs to stop</strong>
    <p><p>I have been loving the passionate posts on here lately so I figured I'd write one of my own. The fear mongering needs to stop. We have dramatically changed our way of life all over a virus with a 98% survival rate. The constant push for fear of your neighbor from the media has turned the general public into shaming assholes. Social media is a disease, filled with virtue signaling celebrities and doomers who think they're better than everybody because they have stayed inside for the last 6-12 months, deprived themselves of real human interaction, and shifted to living their lives online entirely. These people exist because they're fucking bitter that every body else is still trying to live their normal lives while they whither away in their gross apartments, typing furiously to people who didn't wear a mask outside online. </p>
<p>It makes me sick to my stomach that this year at Christmas I went to hug my own grandmother and she pushed me away because "we shouldn't be doing that", while the rest of my family glared at me in judgement as if to say, "How dare you hug your grandmother, you could kill her!" Embarrassed, I just walked away and sat in another room. We can all sit in the same room next to each other with no masks and eat and touch the charcuterie board you made for us, but I can't hug you. Merry fucking Christmas I guess. Then even better is about a month later I did end up getting Covid, and my grandmother passive aggressively texted me, "Shouldn't you have let us know you were Covid positive when you saw us?" even though I wasn't, they just don't bother to try and hear me over their own fear. </p>
<p>What's even worse to me is social media. Seeing posts like "well this could all be over if YOU didn't go to that party." or, "if everyone was just like ME and stayed home this wouldn't be happening." all me me me, I'm the best, I'm doing what's right, YOU are the enemy. The one that was the worst to me was a comment saying, "This wouldn't be happening if you Trump supporters would stop screaming about 'yOuR rIgHtS!'" Like ... actually mocking people for caring about their personal liberties and not willing to sacrifice them for a little bit of safety. People like that are the reason we are in this mess. I guess if you don't care at all about your rights and freedom of choice, that's your business. But don't you dare shit on people for caring about their freedoms. </p>
<p>We have been wearing masks for months, tried multiple lockdowns, tried the 6 feet apart, nothing is working, clearly. It's fine to stand right next to someone in fucking Target but you can't see your friends and family. Church is a no go but the liquor store is A-ok! You have to wear a mask to walk from the door to your table in a restaurant but you can take it off as soon as you sit down. Seriously, why are we still doing this? The only way things will ever go back to normal is when we all decide "I'm done" and we stop following these ridiculous rules. You're not a bad person for seeing your friends, you're not the devil for choosing to not wear a mask, you are NORMAL. This needs to fucking stop.</p></p>

        <p>I've got a buddy who will never admit he bought a crappy video game. Whatever the flaws may be, once he's bought it he'll overlook them and defend his purchase.  </p>
<p>That same psychological phenomenon is primarily what is driving the covid situation at this point.  People have too much pride in their own judgement to admit they bought a lie (or a lemon in the case of my buddy).</p>

        <p>Well, the mortality rate is definitely lower than 2% they're reporting, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was even lower than the 0.2% you're claiming, but since you're making that claim, I would appreciate if you were kind enough to show us the data you're basing that on, because to the best of my knowledge, nobody knows the number of infected people and without that it's impossible to calculate that. Just saying.</p>

        <p>The WHO admitted that around 1 billion people have probably already contacted covid (this was also 5 months ago)...the IFR is now undeniably in the territory of the annual flu. Remember what 1 billion infected by H1N1 meant? It meant the virus's mortality rate was not 3%, but 0.1%. This means the exact same thing. 800 million people already having covid brings the IFR down to 0.15%.</p>

        <p>"Probably" is hardly data you can base claims like that on, me thinks. Just the same, if I were to extrapolate from the information I have, I would assume that more than half world's population already had covid. But that's only a guess in both cases. Nobody's testing large groups of people for antibodies, so there's that</p>

        <p>You do realize IFR is an estimate, right? It's still more reliable than CFR, because in a highly contagious respiratory virus like covid, for every case that gets recorded, there are ten more since the vast majority of people who get infected either have mild symptoms or none at all &amp; which doesn't warrant a test.</p>

        <p>If you think the IFR is "just a geuss" than you need to study virology &amp; epidemiology more.</p>
<p>Also, not even half the human population will get covid, (most likely only a fourth of the human population actually will). Herd immunity kicks in long before that.</p>

But if you're starting to claim actual numbers, you better have something to support your claims, because otherwise all you're doing is providing the point to people claiming that those against lockdowns, masks and all can't even count, all they do is making numbers up and thus cannot be taken seriously.</p>

<p>“By this time in December last year, we had diagnosed over 100 flu cases in our laboratory. This year we have had none,” Landry said.</p>
<p>It’s thought that flu transmission has been suppressed by the precautions in place for COVID-19.</p>
<p>But numbers aren’t lowered from covid? Covid spreads thru droplets right? And influenza from aerosolized particles but particles go thru the mask but droplets much less.</p>

        <p>**Que the crickets!!!  I'm expecting nothing but silence in response to all these sources that never get looked at:**</p>
<p>Here are some sources showing more about how the deaths were over counted:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw9Ci2PZKZg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw9Ci2PZKZg</a></p>
<p>Illinois Head of the Department of Public Health states that if there is a positive PCR test, the death is recorded as a covid death no matter what. She says this in her own words to the camera in a video.</p>
<p>Dr. Birx says the same thing:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHp1GdOD4k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHp1GdOD4k</a></p>
<p>Deborah Leah Birx is an American physician and diplomat who served as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator under President Donald Trump from 2020 to 2021</p>
<p>She's on video stating this. You can't disprove this.</p>
<p>That is not accurate reporting of covid deaths. And if you think that it is, just end this conversation now because we have nothing more to say to each other.</p>
<p>US flu cumulative hospitalizations in 2017-2018 flu season: 710,000</p>
<p>That was just one flu season- BEFORE everything was called Covid-19.</p>
<p>Now, with every hospital visit being called a covid visit:</p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_coronavirus_hospitalizations">https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_coronavirus_hospitalizations</a></p>
<p>It's at 853,414. And we all know that's over-inflated, includes every common cold and influenza, and is spread WELL OVER 1 flu season.</p>
<p>Influenza in Bolivia is the number one killer every single year.</p>
<p>Stop telling me to be afraid of something that's WAY less deadly than the flu. Covid isn't shit.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWNkJUDctdk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWNkJUDctdk</a></p>
<p>Watch this video. PCR test is a farce and should never be used to determine the existence of covid-19.</p>
<p>The New York Times: PCR is giving 90% false positives.</p>

<p>All these are influenza cases causing hospitals in UK to be overrun BEFORE 2020</p>

<p>All different years. Someone even posted a collage of headlines dating back 8 years and every single one had flu cases overrunning hospitals.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page, you'll find a download link for an excel spreadsheet that gives the number of pneumonia / influenza deaths at each medical or nursing home facility in the UK from 2015 to 2017. It's quite a lot. Breaks it down by sex and age. This is way before covid so again, you cannot blame all this on covid or pretend it never happened before covid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/008999numberofdeathsfrominfluenzaorpneumoniaclinicalcommissioninggroupsinenglandregisteredbetween2015to2017">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/adhocs/008999numberofdeathsfrominfluenzaorpneumoniaclinicalcommissioninggroupsinenglandregisteredbetween2015to2017</a></p>
<p>and</p>
<p>In 2018 alone, pneumonia killed 800,000 children, and while deaths from other infectious diseases, including malaria, diarrhoea are falling, fatal pneumonia cases are declining at a much slower pace.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/11/1051161">https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/11/1051161</a></p>
<p>And the CDC is under a lawsuit for violating federal law and inflating Covid deaths by up to 1,600% based on this study:</p>
<p><a href="https://medicalkidnap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CDC-Illegal-COVID-Deaths.pdf">https://medicalkidnap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CDC-Illegal-COVID-Deaths.pdf</a></p>
<p>It's been called out several times last year for inflating numbers. This is nothing new.</p>
<p>Sorry, but calling every single death a covid death is pretty fucking lame. I don't submit to fear porn.</p>
<p>Watch some of this doctor's videos. Check out her book.</p>

        <p>I would call it a 100% survival rate.  We all survived whatever the fuck it was in March through May.  After that, every single graph shows a normal death rate with the expected increase that happens every single year.  </p>
<p>Every single year sees an increase in deaths from the previous year because we always have more people.  It's a steady curve.  The ONLY spike is from March to May and almost all of that was in nursing homes.</p>
<p>So no... this virus now has a 100% survival rate because it's come and gone and we're still here.  It's over now.  </p>
<p>Unless someone can show me lab tests other than PCR that are used to identify this virus (and I want purified cultures in living human tissue samples), I will maintain that this virus does not pose a threat all all to me or anyone I know. </p>
<p>New variants?  Lies.  Second, third, or 4th waves?  Lies.   Vaccine?  Not needed and poison.  It's hurt a LOT of people and it even kills... all for nothing!</p>
<p>Even if covid is not a lie, our response to it sure was!   If it wasn't for the media, no one would have even noticed it!  Life in hospitals would have remained the same and those few that got overrun would have recovered like they do almost every single flu season.</p>

        <p>&rt;It makes me sick to my stomach that this year at Christmas I went to hug my own grandmother and she pushed me away because "we shouldn't be doing that", while the rest of my family glared at me in judgement as if to say, "How dare you hug your grandmother, you could kill her!" Embarrassed, I just walked away and sat in another room. We can all sit in the same room next to each other with no masks and eat and touch the charcuterie board you made for us, but I can't hug you. Merry fucking Christmas I guess. Then even better is about a month later I did end up getting Covid, and my grandmother passive aggressively texted me, "Shouldn't you have let us know you were Covid positive when you saw us?" even though I wasn't, they just don't bother to try and hear me over their own fear. </p>
<p>Dude. Cut these people out of your life. Full stop. Your life will only get better, I promise.</p>
