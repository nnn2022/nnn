    <strong>Watching my grandparents lives be destroyed by doomers is killing me</strong>
    <p><p>This is honestly a pretty small thing but I'm extremely, *profoundly* pissed off by it and have nowhere else to share. (Sorry for the swearing)</p>
<p>My almost 90 year old grandpa has been alone on the other side of the country for over a year now. His dog passed away last week and he's obviously pretty shattered, so my amazing sister and her partner flew out to spend some time with him and look for a senior dog to adopt. My gramps made a reservation at a nice restaurant for the three of them, and when they showed up they were turned away for *not being residents of the province*.</p>
<p>Are you fucking kidding me right now? The three of them are fully vaccinated. My sister has a Masters in Microbiology and spent the last year doing COVID RESEARCH for fucks sake. They've done everything they were supposed to do, done everything right, PLUS WAY MORE.</p>
<p>I know it's so stupid and minor, but my grandpa is really old-fashioned and we're his only granddaughters so treating us out for meals is really special to him. Imagining how happy and excited he must have been, only to get sucker-punched *again* by a government that just barely pretends to give a shit about him. It actually made me cry. I'm crushed and I'm just so tired. </p>
<p>I started typing out "I'm grateful that she could be there at all" but then I realized that's a bootlicker thing to say, and actually, I'm not grateful at all. I hate this country for stealing the joy from my grandpa's last few years of life. This man is literally a fucking top-ranking general officer and dedicated his life to this shithole, spent 6 months+ away from his wife and kids on a regular basis. As thanks, he hasn't even been allowed to play golf, his favourite activity, *outside*, or take his granddaughter out for dinner.</p>
<p>To be frank, Trudeau can suck my ass. Our government is out of control with power. Seriously, imagine spending the last year you have on Earth in fucking lockdown lmao. What a joke. Watching my grandparents be destroyed by this shit and being told "it's for their sake" and that *I'm* a granny killer is too much. I can't deal with it anymore. My family is very pro-vaccine (I was the only one who didn't get it) and even they're starting to doubt things. I think the restaurant situation will be the straw that breaks the camel's back for them because it really makes no sense. My dad is a smart guy and I get the impression he's starting to feel duped.</p>
<p>I'm getting so fucking mad at people insisting this is all to protect the elderly. They're not "being protected" anymore. My grandpa barely had any time left before and the stress and sadness of all this has probably cut that down by half. And this isn't even mentioning my other grandpa, who passed within days of receiving the vaccine. He was in his 80s but still living independently with his wife, happy, no health problems, active with the grandkids, etc. It was out of the blue.</p>
<p>Tldr: fuck these dickheads.</p></p>

<p>It isn't though.  Don't let these doomers gaslight you into feeling selfish for wanting to enjoy life.  Life is precious.  It is a tragedy to waste it living in fears of germs.  I'm old enough to remember, way back in 2019, when excessive fear of germs was considered a mental disease.  Now it's being normalized and even celebrated.  Don't doubt yourself.  You are 100% right to feel cheated and outraged by this deplorable treatment.</p>

        <p>Also, yes his one particular situation is minor, but the whole thing stops being minor when you realise it's been applied to every single person in the country/world. Everyone losing a small amount = in total, a big amount has been lost.</p>

        <p>I know someone who's grandpa deteriorated from the constant lockdowns in a care facility. He had Alzheimer's and the lack of seeing family and him not being able to understand why no one could see him really hit hard. I'm sure he thought that he was forgotten about or no one wanted to see him. His family was furious and would try to see him, but they had stupid restrictions and "just following orders". Eventually they were able to see him for an hour outside a few times I think, but by then the damage had been done. He regressed so far. He died from Covid alright - but not from catching it. He died from the lockdowns and the insane mandates. How is that "saving lives" and "saving grandparents"?</p>

        <p>As a fellow Canadian I can 100% assure that we're being HEAVILY lied too in Toronto. Our "case numbers" are a huge lie based off forced and random testing via a false PCR test.
