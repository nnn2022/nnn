    <strong>I can't wake him up to what is going on, and not sure why. What about those of us with no support?</strong>
    <p><p>I convinced him of the medical dangers of the vaxx [he has a condition that can cause blood clots very easily] but with the rest I am failing and not sure why. I showed him this article and it's like he got angry...[it is even written by a fellow leftist] I didn't get it. He said, It's full of rhetoric.</p>
<p>https://cjhopkins.substack.com/p/the-propaganda-war-and-how-to-fight</p>
<p>He seems to think I am "crazy" and gone too much into "conspiracy". He knows about my conspiracy past. When I was a fundamentalist Christian, and into conspiracy theory and bible prophecy, he never converted in, I converted in after we were married. I deconverted but spent over 14 years as a Christian fundamentalist. Somehow things worked out between us. He had friends even asking why he was staying with me. He was happy when I deconverted and returned to the regular liberal world", I always kept some leftist views like antiwar etc. </p>
<p>I know my latest thoughts are upsetting him, my rejection of the DNC [hate both parties], my questioning of Covid and not trusting the system.</p>
<p>I have been shocked and dismayed that he trusts the system out there. I even brought up the PCR tests and told him about that several times, and he just ignores the facts, though he went silent having no answer for that one. He shook his head and said "So much about this is confusing". I said, "It's because we are being lied to."</p>
<p>I told him I believe there is still some real virus out there but PCR tests exaggerated the numbers. My head hurts, I had to work so hard to even prove the case about vaxx to him.</p>
<p>What scares me is when I said they may make the vaxx mandatory, he pooh-poohs it. He says oh the Republicans won't let it happen, I said I'm glad some are standing up against it. He said, "It never will happen, I said "That's what they have planned.".  The denial is immense. He keeps saying "What do you expect me to do about it?"</p>
<p>His parents were pre-teens in Nazi Germany [they were Germans, and one ate out of trashcans,  and one was abandoned in a hospital and had a sniper shoot at her in the woods and had to run to escape Prussia, according to her journal, so why isn't he waking up seeing how bad things were getting?</p>
<p>I know he's upset when I talk about bible prophecy. He's upset I am a disaffected leftist and keeps talking to me about voter suppression, which I hate that too, but we have bigger problems on our plate. </p>
<p>We are surrounded by Covid disciples, his NPC friend, our very liberal church, etc etc. He's being indoctrinated. I even worry about the vaxx though he has no plans to get it for now. I am scared, I can't even speak openly in my own home without him getting upset. He does help me with caretaking and I am very disabled. I love him but I am so disappointed. I even said, "Why do you believe in the system?" and got angry.</p>
<p>I probably will have to drop all discussion of these topics including politics. I'm not achieving anything talking about it. scary. I do not feel listened to at all. This is forming a chasm between us, our marriage was a happy one too.</p>
<p>I have no one to talk to around here. I am so alone, and its EGG SHELLS with everyone and now that includes husband.</p></p>

        <p>Take a different approach. We can’t let this be the new normal. No vaccine passports, no QR codes, no social credit score, no more lockdowns, no more mass lay offs. If you focus on those aspects, you might make more progress and find common ground.</p>

        <p>Oh I told him about digital ID and vaccine passports, he just doesn't care. I even told him it will be a social credit score and more lockdowns are coming. I think he LIKES living this way which is a whole other issue. [he works from home and even went into this litany, saying well we are where we'd be now today anyhow, because you are housebound from the heat and I am working as usual] He ignores the dangers of collapse etc etc. Just shrugs his shoulder. I can't do anything about it.  So I tried those approaches too.
He reads this website constantly which is IRONICALLY named.</p>

        <p>Then let him know he is the real extremist and you just want to go back to normal and this whole thing started with two weeks to stop the spread and here we are over a year later. It’s possible they are so brainwashed nothing will reach them. I’d move on to someone else.</p>

        <p>I am not sure what to do. This is a almost 25 year old marriage. I don't think I can reach him at all. I am going to just have to take care of myself but I am so depressed from having no one around it's taking a massive toll. I am very disabled, and could end up in a nursing home. </p>
<p>I have woken up crying more then often some mornings. He is only person I have to talk to in person. I mentioned last night we were told two weeks to flatten the curve and now it's been two years. </p>
<p>If he takes the vaxx, I will see that as total submission to the system. So far I see no plans to do that, but it scares the hell out of me. </p>
<p>He did say what if you are the one that is wrong? I said I assess myself all the time.....I've researched this heavily, I said I would rather die of Covid than become a human GMO or owned by the system. He thinks I am nuts, I can tell. :'( I think I was born into hell.</p>

        <p>We can all relate and you are not alone. We must stand strong. This is a major turning point in history. It’s bigger than any one of us individually. You can agree to disagree on other facets but and for now you can use the non fda approval to stave off him getting the “vaxxx”.</p>

        <p>Yeah I should focus on him not getting the vaxx, the rest is neither here or there. I'm going to take a "vacation", if they make it mandatory, it will break my heart if he doesn't go with, but I guess I better prepare myself for the possibility.  Thank you for the support. So far he's not giving in to the vaxx, so that is a good thing. He knows and admits it would be dangerous for me.</p>

        <p>Count your blessings on the vaxxx part. Many of us have had our entire family get it despite our pleas not to. That’s a major win for you and I would be content with that even if you can’t find agreement on other points.</p>

        <p>&rt;I always kept some leftist views like anti-war</p>
<p>Sorry darling, that's a kinda conservative view now. The leftists are warhawks and eager to fund the industrial military complex. </p>
<p>But to the point... cognitive dissonance and the backfire effect. </p>
<p>That is what is plagging your husband.</p>
<p><strong>Cognitive dissonance</strong> is a theory in social psychology. It refers to the mental conflict that occurs when a person’s behaviors and beliefs do not align.
It may also happen when a person holds two beliefs that contradict one another.</p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance causes feelings of unease and tension, and people attempt to relieve this discomfort in different ways. Examples include “explaining things away” or rejecting new information that conflicts with their existing beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>Belief perseverance</strong> (also known as conceptual conservatism) is maintaining a belief despite new information that firmly contradicts it. Such beliefs may even be strengthened when others attempt to present evidence debunking them, a phenomenon known as the <em>backfire effect</em></p>

        <p>Oh I agree the left is prowar now, there's no damn antiwar movement left, they succeeded in becoming bootlickers to the industrial military complex along with big Pharm.</p>
<p>I think he is having major cognitive dissonance, I can see the wavering. He says things like "I don't know what to think". "I don't know what is going on".  He is a life long leftist, but he had years of hearing me talk about conspiracy stuff, I told him this matches Rev 13. He gets uncomfortable with some things I say.  Is there a way to break through cognitive dissonance. He simply seems unable to believe that our politicians have evil intent. [he is a bernie/AOC supporter]</p>
<p>Yeah I worry about the backfire effect. I'm not haranguing him, leave the topic alone a lot because I don't want him doubling down, or proving me wrong. I thought he was smarter than this. I have laid out so many facts, I am exhausted. He knows I believed in everything and then woke up. I plan to keep mouth shut today. When I cry, he is still asleep from working the night before.</p>

        <p>Cognitive dissonance can actually be physically painful so there are many physical effects from it. One of the problems is with the Overton window and how it moves left.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:
&rt;The Overton window is the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time. It is also known as the window of discourse. The term is named after American policy analyst Joseph P. Overton, who stated that an idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within this range, rather than on politicians' individual preferences. According to Overton, the window frames the range of policies that a politician can recommend without appearing too extreme to gain or keep public office given the climate of public opinion at that time.</p>
<p>So as the Overton window moves the views of each party change. The left becomes farther left, the farther left becomes socialist, the socialist become communist, the Communists become totalitarian. </p>
<p>This happens on the conservative side as well as the left wing parties push left this drags the conservative parties to the left. Now you have people who were normal liberals and centrists being categorized as center right or conservatives. They didn't leave their party their party left them. When I was younger I was a liberal and the liberal party left me behind. Well certainly my views have matured and evolved as I have become educated but my principles are still the same and the left doesn't have principles they stand on.</p>
<p>I believe your husband is also struggling with this Overton window shift. In order to stay a liberal he has to shift his beliefs and his principles to a place he might not agree with. That has caused a tremendous amount of cognitive dissidence for liberals and centrists alike. The walk away movement is based on it. So he can either be abandoned by his political party and feel that sadness or he can bend himself to fit in and feel the mental anguish. </p>
<p>&rt;The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of leftist anti-war activists out there, look up the grayzone crew with Max Blumenthal, Aaron Mate, Ben Norton etc... Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi have always stayed consistent with their ideology. If you want some real leftist anti-war and anti-covid look up Eva K Bartlett, Vanessa Beeley, Whitney Webb etc. There are some people out there doing good work.</p>
<p>Mainstream "leftism" in the USA isn't actually leftism per se. Biden is a neo-liberal warhawk and has never been associated with the left. Those who are super woke antifa "anarchists" have a completely mistaken identity, and likely don't give a shit with the USA/CIA operations abroad - because they're just middle-class whites who have nothing better to do than to complain about identity in their ultra progressive city.</p>
