    <strong>The New Normal, also know as The New World Order, The coronavirus Plandemic and everything around it goes like this: The classic formula of: Problem &gt; Reaction &gt; Solution.</strong>
    <p><p>The New Normal, also know as The New World Order, The coronavirus Plandemic and everything around it goes like this: This is the classic formula of:</p>
<p><strong>" Create a problem &rt; wait for people reaction &rt; offer a solution "</strong></p>
<p>The solution is something horrible that people would never accept under normal conditions, that's why this sibylline strategy is used: you create an artificial problem and use social engineering to your  advantage, wait for people to gladly take your horrible solution and beg you on their knees to be applied.</p>
<p>A power grab, more control over people, the violation of individual  freedoms and our fundamental rights, change and application of  tyrannical laws, more power for the police to enforce it, violation of  our privacy, internet censorship, single thought in the mainstream  media. The excuse is a deadly virus, inject fear into people minds in a  year of incessant propaganda from the mass media, because people who are afraid are easy to control, repeat a lie a thousand times and it will come true, make this grain of sand as big as the moon and soon people  will accept anything without question it. Just like Malcolm X said:</p>
<h1>“If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”</h1>
<p>The mass media have played a fundamental role here, we must also denounce this, they all  are also part of this snowball getting so big, they work for the elite, they all manipulate us, they all are playing with us to achieve their own interests. With politics is the same history, everyone works for the same ringmaster, we have to denounce this now too and start to wake up, critical thinking and questioning everything, this is the era of the great deception. This is a world war and is happening right now, the war of the 1% against us the 99%. It's a worldwide war, no matter where are you from, your race, sex or convictions. We must start to fight back all of this, is the future of the humanity what is being played. we have to wake up others, and share as much information as we can, and denounce manipulation, oppression, corruption and the tyranny.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>I forgot to mention collaborationism: Collaborators, those people with stockholm syndrome who willingly work for the tyrant. In our current scenario, all those who are doing gestapo-police right now with other people not wearing masks, with other people trying to open their businesses to feed their families. Collaborators point to others, they do virtue signalling and patrol around taking photos of those who do not comply with the new established order, it's the banality of evil that feeds on itself and becomes common, normal and accepted because everyone does it. </p>
<p>Collaborationists fervently applaud the establishment of concentration camps, indiscriminate arrests and they're always willing to give up all their freedoms, passive conformists, in exchange for stability, personal benefit, immunity, or an acceptance within this new normal.</p>
<p><strong>This is exactly what happened in the Nazi Germany with the Jewish ghetto police, they were Jews who guarded and watched over other imprisoned Jews, they served as support police.</strong> <strong>they were even more cruel than the Nazi military themselves.</strong> The Jewish ghetto police watched over others Jewish prisoners day and night, they did intimidation, extortion, torture, sexual abuse and denounced those breaking the rules, <strong>all of this in exchange for stability, personal benefit, immunity, or an acceptance within this new normal.</strong></p>
<h1>When the war ended, some former members of the jewish police were accused of collaborating in the Holocaust, and in Israel some of them came to be tried.</h1></p>

        <p>Absolutely spot on with everything you've written! This was taken from the Rockefeller playbook, from the lockstep portion specifically... don't tell this to doomers because their heads would explode</p>

        <p>Absolutely fantastic, thanks for share.</p>
<p>Love the way the Problem Person is drawn so small and the Solution Person as a giant.  makes it very clear.</p>
