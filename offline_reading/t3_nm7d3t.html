    <strong>Food for thought for everyone. Especially you lurkers</strong>
    <p><p>The UK government counts a covid death as:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-reported-sars-cov-2-deaths-in-england/covid-19-confirmed-deaths-in-england-report">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-reported-sars-cov-2-deaths-in-england/covid-19-confirmed-deaths-in-england-report</a></p>
<p>"In this report deaths are defined as a death in a person with a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test and either:</p>
<p>died within 60 days of the first specimen date</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>died more than 60 days after the first specimen date with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate"  </p>
<p>The American government (Michigan specifically, first one I found):</p>
<p>"Taking the COVID-19 cases that are referred to the Michigan Disease Surveillance System and comparing the entire list for the past 30 days to the vital records data to see if any cases in the system have died in the past 30 days from natural causes. An accidental death or an accident wouldn’t be ruled out, but natural causes that are recorded on a death certificate for a confirmed case of COVID-19 within 30 days and the onset of symptoms would count as a COVID-19 associated death, state officials said.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.clickondetroit.com/health/good-health/2020/07/23/why-are-additional-covid-19-deaths-added-to-michigans-state-count-after-review-of-records/%3foutputType=amp">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.clickondetroit.com/health/good-health/2020/07/23/why-are-additional-covid-19-deaths-added-to-michigans-state-count-after-review-of-records/%3foutputType=amp</a></p>
<p>Imagine if the government counted any death within 30 days of marijuana use to be a marijuana death? How many millions would marijuana have killed by now? Clearly none, but the data would say millions! Why would they use that methodology when you will get horribly inaccurate results? They are manipulating data.  </p>
<p>Isn't it interesting that we all social distanced, masked up, and hand washed enough to get rid of the flu. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/11/amid-coronavirus-flu-cases-record-low/4127197001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/11/amid-coronavirus-flu-cases-record-low/4127197001/</a>  </p>
<p>But we also did all that so little, that we kept seeing resurgences in Covid??<br>
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm</a>  </p>
<p>How come you all are so hellbent on making sure everyone is vaccinated, when according to the CDC the vaccine will not prevent you from spreading it to others, or even catching it yourself. Meaning a vaccinated person is no less likely to spread covid to grandma than a non-vaccinated person. " Until we know more about how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19, people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should keep <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">taking precautions</a> in public places like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others, avoiding crowds..."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html</a>  </p>
<p>I also find it peculiar that in 2016, preventable medical errors were the 3rd leading cause of death in the US, but they are not talked about in 2020? (I can't find data, just articles about potential changes to prevent medical errors) <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us">https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us</a></p>

        <p>Something I found to think about:  “An incubation period is the time it takes between contracting a virus and experiencing symptoms,” says Dr. Abreu Lanfranco. “For COVID-19, the incubation period is 2 to 14 days, while for the flu, it’s on average 1 to 4 days. The discrepancy between these incubation periods is because of how each virus attaches itself to the cells.” </p>
<p>Because the flu has a shorter incubation period, you’ll experience symptoms more quickly and you’ll know to stay away from others to avoid spreading the illness. But you could potentially be exposed to COVID-19 and develop symptoms for up to 2 weeks. A large number of people could spread COVID-19 even before developing symptoms, as this 2-week period allows for a much longer time to unknowingly infect others.</p>

        <p>Excess death statistics shred your theory. </p>
<p>I’m not sure what British deaths are in a normal year vs how many should have died in 2020 of covid didn’t exist, vs how many died in 2020 OVER what was expected. </p>
<p>If you’re looking at US data, ~2,800,000 died in 2019.  Around 2,800,000-2,900,000 should have died in 2020.  That number shot up to 3,300,000ish confirmed dead Americans by the end of the year. </p>
<p>If I’m tracking deaths shortly after a positive Covid 19 deaths, I’m very likely to get decently accurate numbers because there’s proven causality between contracting covid-19 and dying from it.  Positive marijuana test vs death is useless because we both know there is no link between marijuana usage and deaths. </p>
<p>Vaccines work.  I don’t have to explain it.  They work and there’s plenty of data to back it up.  </p>
<p>Did you even read your article regarding “preventable medical errors”?</p>
<p>“The researchers caution that most of medical errors aren’t due to inherently bad doctors, and that reporting these errors shouldn’t be addressed by punishment or legal action. Rather, they say, most errors represent systemic problems, including poorly coordinated care, fragmented insurance networks, the absence or underuse of safety nets, and other protocols, in addition to unwarranted variation in physician practice patterns that lack accountability.”</p>
<p>Give people access to healthcare and make sure hospitals are funded and have appropriate staff levels and you’re going to prevent a lot of these deaths.</p>

        <p>Huh, who would have thought shutting down everything, including medical appointments for life threatening conditions, could possibly lead to more deaths? I did read it, these are the type of medical errors I'm sure they mean.   </p>

<p>Funny how suicide rates haven't gone up at all, but yet according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield, MD, "We're seeing, sadly, far greater suicides now than we are deaths from COVID. We're seeing far greater deaths from drug overdose that are above excess that we had as background than we are seeing the deaths from COVID."<br>
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/these-2-things-are-killing-more-young-people-than-covid-cdc-director-says/ar-BB17iype">https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/these-2-things-are-killing-more-young-people-than-covid-cdc-director-says/ar-BB17iype</a>  </p>
<p>And according to Canadian suicide hotlines, "Distress Centre Calgary says suicide-related calls, texts and chats were up 66 per cent in October compared with the same month in 2019." </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/dealing-with-a-lot-suicide-crisis-calls-mount-during-covid-19-pandemic-1.5215056">https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/dealing-with-a-lot-suicide-crisis-calls-mount-during-covid-19-pandemic-1.5215056</a>  </p>
<p>So there's increase in domestic abuse, <br>
"Reports from local police near the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China's Hubei province, indicate that DV tripled during February 2020 compared to February 2019 [[8]]. Also, according to the United Nations entity UN Women, DV reports in France have increased 30% since they initiated a March 17 lockdown. DV calls in Argentina have increased 25% since their March 20 lockdown [[9]]. The organization also reports a 30% increase in helpline calls in Cyprus and 33% increase in Singapore [[9]]. However, in the US, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on DV is just beginning to be realized via anecdotal reports since there is limited data available to assess how DV has changed following implementation of stay-at-home orders."<br>
<a href="https://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(20)30307-7/fulltext">https://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(20)30307-7/fulltext</a>  </p>
<p>Increase in drug abuse and overdose, "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of June 2020, 13% of Americans reported starting or increasing substance use as a way of coping with stress or emotions related to COVID-19. Overdoses have also spiked since the onset of the pandemic. A reporting system called ODMAP shows that the early months of the pandemic brought an 18% increase nationwide in overdoses compared with those same months in 2019. The trend has continued throughout 2020, according to the American Medical Association, which reported in December that more than 40 U.S. states have seen increases in opioid-related mortality along with ongoing concerns for those with substance use disorders."</p>

<p>Plus historically pandemics bring more suicide. But there's no rise in suicides? Seems strange. <br>

        <p>So you've established the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suicide rates did not increase during this pandemic.</li>
<li>Overdose deaths increased during this pandemic. </li>
</ol>
<p>And in the US Context, COVID19 was the third leading cause of death in 2020 with 350k American COVID deaths</p>
<p>I don't dispute the data or links.  More people overdosed, more people were in distress, hospitals laid off workers (meanwhile those working in covid units were incredibly busy),.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>47,000 Americans committed suicide in 2019.  70,000 people overdosed and died in 2019 in the US.  You quoted an 18% increase in nationwide overdoses.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm</a></p>
<p>It looks like we're on track to seeing 80-100k overdose deaths in 2020 using the 12 month count as of Oct 2020.  </p>
<p>You claim "Government lockdowns have killed way more than the virus has."  Where's your evidence?  You have the death tables, you have the CDC reporting increased overdose deaths and you believe that.  But when the same CDC reports 600K US Covid deaths, you call that into question?</p>
<p>"Plus historically pandemics bring more suicide. But there's no rise in suicides? Seems strange.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsguides.com/hopkins/view/Johns_Hopkins_Psychiatry_Guide/787393/all/Suicide_Risk_in_the_COVID_19_Pandemic">https://www.hopkinsguides.com/hopkins/view/Johns_Hopkins_Psychiatry_Guide/787393/all/Suicide_Risk_in_the_COVID_19_Pandemic</a>"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You concede that pandemics bring more suicide.  You literally recognize that past pandemics have caused hardships that led to people commiting suicides.  Why is it so hard for you to accept that 350k Americans died in 2020, about 50k died of suicides, and anywhere from 80-100k likely died of an overdose.</p>
<p>No shit a disease that killed 600k Americans and millions around the world forced governments to take action and even then, not everyone was lucky.  Millions died and continue to die globally and the stress/hardship took a toll on the population as well. </p>
<p>Not taking any precautions and letting 2.2 million Americans die so you and the rest of this sub can pretend everything is normal was never an option.</p>
