    <strong>Doomer is actually aware of the uselessness of the vaccine in young healthy people, but lets the government force them get it anyway</strong>
    <p><p>Background information: my sibling pretty doomer and pretty left, obsessed with npr. Also, I live in New York State and am planning to transfer from a private college, to a State University of New York in the fall.</p>
<p>We were having a casual conversation talking about the vaccine. They outright admitted that getting the vaccine as young, healthy people (like them and I are) is basically pointless, because even with the vaccine you can still get the virus and spread it. The only thing it could really do is possibly lessen how ill you get from it. If you're already young and healthy you wouldn't get very ill from it anyway, if at all, so it'd only be useful in unhealthy or old people who are more likely to die from covid compounded onto their preexisting conditions.</p>
<p>Sounds good so far right? Well then I talked about how Cuomo is doing the Excelsior Pass, and how other colleges in the country are requiring all students attending in person to get the vaccine. I said that because of this, I'm worried Cuomo will make all State Universities require vaccines to attend in person classes. I said if this occurred, I would not get the vax to attend the state university.</p>
<p>They basically go, "What? If that happens you should get the vaccine to be able to go to (state university). It would not be worth it to not get it and have to stay at (my current private college)"</p>
<p>This kind of disturbed me. Because, they are well aware that the vaccine is basically useless in us young healthy folk, AND they agreed that the vaccine was rushed and is not thoroughly tested and studied. And yet, the government's coercion through taking away our freedoms and only giving them back if we agree to get this procedure done on us, is enough to convince them.</p>
<p>They don't ever question, maybe we should fight against this and not play along. They don't say, maybe we should think before we obey the government and get a USELESS, UNDER-TESTED drug just because they're trying to force us, by taking away our rights if we don't.</p>
<p>This tells me that questioning the vaccine is not enough for some people because they will just get walked on by the government and obey just to be free again. The government is getting their way with these people despite them being aware of how useless the vaccine is. That's fucking scary.</p>
<p>What are your guys' thoughts?</p>

        <p>I don’t understand how people are okay with our rights being taken away for refusing the vaccine. Some people actually want unvaccinated people in jail. It’s craziness. The only reason I can think of is mind control from too much mainstream media.</p>

        <p>I think you should trust your gut about the vaccine. If something in you is telling you not to get it for any reason, don’t, even if you have to change your college plans. If you actually want it, go for it but it sounds like you don’t. </p>
<p>I’m not giving medical advice btw. But for me personally, I feel really strongly about not getting it and would even be willing to quit my well paying job and work at a lesser paying job if my current employer required it. You’re the only one who can make the decision though.</p>
