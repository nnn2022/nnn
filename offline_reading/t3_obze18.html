        <p>r/aww and r/pics and some other sub did that to me, unprovoked. These mods complain about fascism, yet practice it in their daily life.</p>

        <p>We really need these posts to stop it makes it seem like we want to be victims. I get it I have Subs I have participated in that I went dark from and recently posted and was immediately Auto banned. They're cranking up the propaganda of it but at least this is a safe spot where we can talk it's all being monitored but at least it's an easy access point for communication</p>

        <p>You have to realize most of these posts come from people quite new to this sub, and they are naturally and correctly shocked at such shitty behavior.</p>
<p>Perhaps some automated reply to the poster would help but banning people from saying they're banned is just more banning.</p>

        <p>Everybody that has gotten, or does get, any ban from unrelated subs like that, please report each of them as harassment.</p>
<p>After just finishing reporting a couple, I think that most ways of reporting them <em>might</em> go back to the sub mods.</p>
<p>The way to be sure that a harassment report goes to reddit admins seems to be ONLY by doing it exactly this way (I'm sorry if I'm mistaken here, but this is the best I've got so far):</p>
<p>Use a web browser and go to https://new.reddit.com/</p>
<p>I think it's likely critical to use new. Rather than just www. or old.</p>
<p>Navigate to "messages".  The URL should be:  https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/  but I think just following this link will <em>not</em> take you to the right place.  It seems like you have to navigate there.</p>
<p>Find the offensive message and capture the permalink.  In android, this is long click and select "copy link", in windows it's like r-click and select "copy link", so do whatever you need to do in your web browser to capture the permalink into the clipboard.</p>
<p>With that link in the clipboard, maybe use a new tab, or not, and go to:  https://reddit.com/report  I think you can follow this link and get to the right place.</p>
<p>Select the choices "I want to report spam or abuse", "this is abusive or harassing", "it's targeted harassment", "At me", and then paste the link in the spot for link.  I don't see any need for "additional information", but you do you.  Just keep in mind you'd be taking up a person's time to read that.  Please be considerate.</p>
<p>This is long to describe, but it's pretty quick and easy to do.</p>
<p>You will get a "Help Center Report" message confirmation.  That's how you know for sure it went to reddit administration, and definitely not back to the perpetrating sub.</p>
<p>But please don't make another post here about it.  There's been a whole fucking lot of them already.  We know already.</p>
