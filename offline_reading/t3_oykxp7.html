    <strong>The old science about masks</strong>
    <p><p>This is an article from the Sydney Morning Herald in the SARS1 era in 2003 fact checking the misinformation that masks protect would against the virus and threatening huge fines against retailers who make that claim.</p>
<p>How things have changed in New South Wales:</p>
<p>&rt;Retailers who cash in on community fears about SARS by exaggerating the health benefits of surgical masks could face fines of up to $110,000.<br>
NSW Fair Trading Minister Reba Meagher yesterday warned that distributors and traders could be prosecuted if it was suggested the masks offered unrealistic levels of protection from the disease.</p>
<p>I have noticed that the masks become useless after they are saturated because your breath no longer passes freely through them but puffs out around the sides. I daresay so has everyone who has worn one. This was the Science in 2003.</p>
<p>&rt;Health authorities have warned that surgical masks may not be an effective protection against the virus.<br>
"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney.<br>
"As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets."<br>
Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed.</p>
<p>Are businesses which mandate mask wearing by their employees willing to supply every one with 24 masks each day and also cope with the resulting biohazard waste? Because that is how many it would take to wear them effectively over an eight hour shift.</p>
<p>But this is the key:</p>
<p>&rt;Mr Bell agreed with Professor Cossart's assessment regarding the effectiveness of the masks.<br>
"I think they're of marginal benefit," he said. "In a way <strong><em>they give some comfort to people</em></strong> who think they're doing as much as they can do to prevent the infection."</p>
<p>Can you say, placebo?</p>

        <p>I think it's more than that. </p>
<p>&rt;Public health officials wanted to be seen as recommending something during COVID <strong><em>[in the absence of any positive guidance on early treatment</em></strong>].  </p>
<p>It seems to have been decided early on that any talk of effective early treatment in the midst of an unprecedented epidemic should be sat upon pending the sighting of that elusive creature - a gold standard double blind RCT. Early treatment was therefore removed from public health discourse except for the purpose of debunking or banning the most promising candidates. </p>
<p>But the authorities needed to be seen to be doing something; ergo, mask mandates.</p>

        <p>Everything about public health officials' advice during COVID (lockdowns, mask mandates, and suppressing early treatment) was all meant to coerce people into getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Now, public health officials aren't even recommending that things return to normal after vaccination.</p>
