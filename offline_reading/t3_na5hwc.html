    <strong>Everybody knows they're larping, right?</strong>
    <p><p>I just heard a commercial for vaccine sites in the area, and they're saying "Finally, you'll be safe to get back to what you love--to get back to living your life" like covid was this plague that you could drop dead from at any time, but with this vaccine you're finally safe and free. But we all know that's not the case; not just us on here, but basically everybody knows it's hardly a danger at all.</p>
<p>The people standing 6 feet apart at the grocery store with a bag of chips and a 6-pack <em>know</em> they're not going to drop dead. The people wearing masks on packed planes <em>know</em> they're not in any danger or they wouldn't be there. The people going out to restaurants with a mask and taking them off to eat <em>know</em> they're going to be fine, because they wouldn't risk certain death for a burger. The rioters and looters <em>know</em> covid won't kill them, so they do what they do. Biden and the governors <em>know</em> the virus is not a threat--they hypocritically flaunt the rules they set any chance they get.</p>
<p>Maybe you know some elderly people who have died from it, but the vast majority of people don't even know someone who was hospitalized for covid. Everybody knows they're not really in any immediate danger, but they keep pretending like they are. We're all just in this petty game of make believe that won't end. I STILL see over half the people on the street and in the park on a bright and sunny day wearing masks, even walking by themselves. How are they not embarrassed?</p>
<p>Can we all just stop playing this childish game of pretend?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, they know.</p>
<p>These people have been lying about their "fear of the virus" for some time now. They aren't any more scared of it than we are. They know the threat is exaggerated and their arguments otherwise are disingenuous.</p>
<p>What's at play here is a weird form of "identity politics" where these people have wrapped up their identity into the Covid-19 response.</p>
<p>A trap was set up for them and they fell right in. First we had a cartoon President, Donald Trump. Rather than seeing through the setup, seeing through the farce -- these people became obsessed with him. Media spent 4 years building up such strong emotions against the guy (and Trump played along in the charade) that all they had to do was transfer these feelings against Trump into the Covid-19 response.</p>
<p>Now, if you point out a lie or exaggeration on TV they hear Donald Trump's voice in their ear: "Fake neeeeeeyyywwwz" and you are instantly a "Q-anon conspiracy theorist" to be ignored.</p>
<p>If you are skeptical about the Covid-19 response -- then you're a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>If you oppose lockdowns &amp; mask mandates -- you are a hardcore MAGA racist.</p>
<p>And these people worship the mask as a symbol. They wear it to symbolize that they are NOT "Trump supporters" and they love the idea of people who don't want to wear a mask having to wear one, because subconsciously they are muzzling a "maga supporter."</p>
<p>In reality, they've muzzled themselves and everyone -- but their emotions run so strong that there's no logic or reason here. It's just "my team against yours" and they see things in black &amp; white.</p>
<p>For them, you either support lockdowns &amp; masks forever -- OR you are a hardcore redneck Trump supporter.</p>
<p>That's all it's about at their core. That's as deep as these people go, and it's not even deep enough to be aware of their own motivations.</p>
<p>It literally is "ORANGE MAN BAD. WEAR YOUR MASK."</p>
<p>It's all they have... and as the Covid-19 is exposed as being a farce they're going to feel as dumb as Trump supporters did by the end for supporting him.</p>
<p>See? We're all tricked. They turn us against each other and keep us arguing about stupid things while they loot all the remaining wealth in the country.</p>

        <p>Are you crazy? It is terrifying. The 1918 flu pandemic killed 50 MILLION PEOPLE!! </p>
<p>I threw nobody into poverty. That isn’t my responsibility? and those who lost their jobs I actually aided them in finding the resources they needed whether it be unemployment or just buying them groceries for the week. What did you do last year other than tell others they’re sheep? Idk if you went to school or not but science is a real thing mate.</p>

        <p>No one is denying science. The science tells us you have at least a 99.8% chance of surviving covid. The science shows us that mask mandates had a statistically negligible impact on deaths. The science shows us that the testing on this vaccine has not yet revealed what the long term consequences will be. What are you referring to when you say we don't believe in "science"? I don't believe the government has my best interest at heart, that's for sure.</p>

        <p>This is quite the delusional bunch. If you’re in this sub and on the rocks on how to feel, the pandemic is real. People are dying everyday. Check out India. Children are losing their mothers, fathers, siblings..and vice versa
It is not a .02% death rate. This has been happening for the past year and /r/nonewnormal calls it a game.</p>

        <p>Per the CDC: In only ~5% of the 560,616 "COVID deaths" was COVID-19 the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. The other ~95% of "COVID deaths" had an average of 4.0 additional comorbidities. So, since ~March 2020, an absolute maximum of ~28,000 people in the US have died solely from COVID.</p>

        <p>This is what I like to see. A strong, scientific, rational argument against the covid lunacy. I remember reading on the website that they have an average of 4 comorbidities but I can't find it anymore. Could you provide a link to a source for your comment so I can have it for reference?</p>

        <p>Okay, then what is the death rate? Yes the virus is REAL. I'm saying the response (masks mandates, complete ongoing lockdowns, forced quarantines, a huge uptick in arbitrary government power) do not match the danger. </p>
<p>My specific point on this post was that everyone knows healthy people are in practically no danger and are just participating in the madness for social conventions. I just saw a dude wearing a mask walking completely alone on the side of a country road in daylight. Do you think he genuinely believes that right then and there he is in grave danger of covid and that mask is going to save his life? Of course not. He's wearing it because those are the rules of the game we're playing</p>

<p>The "New Normal" you support is what did that, buddy. I understand you won't actually hold your self accountable and blame others for your support of their actions...</p>
<p>But they couldn't have done it without you and people like you.</p>
<p>Have you considered how many hypochondriacs your policies have created? How many agoraphobes? How many children's ability to socialize you've destroyed for life - at a time when science knows that socialization is THE MOST important thing for them... </p>
