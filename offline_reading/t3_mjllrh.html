        <p>The reason being that on a given day you'll write hundreds of lines for charting. Typing out "History of", or "Signs and symptons", or "Complains of", or "Chief complaint" (you get the idea) is pretty annoying. So, the medical community has developed a fairly extensive short hand system. </p>
<p>It's not 100% universal, but there are some really common ones. The quality control department of the various hospitals, fire districts, and ambulance companies will usually have their own list of acceptable short hand.</p>
<p>The ones I used above are hx (or h/o), s/s, c/o, and c/c. You pick them up as you go along.</p>

        <p>Yes. But the whole linchpin behind lockdowns, social distancing, rushed vaccines, masking and all the other fear porn was their claim that asymptomatic transmission (silent carrier) was this huge menace.  You take that away and you just have to quarantine the sick...like every other respiratory virus in history.</p>

        <p>Half my ER team and I were furloughed last year because of lack of patients. The idea that the hospitals were ever overwhelmed is pretty laughable. We even had one hospital in our metro are that was shuttered because they simply didn't have enough patients. None of our hospitals ever hit 75% capacity from March 2020 to February of 2021.</p>

        <p>This has always been my assumption based on my life experience and understanding of how getting sick works.</p>
<p>It's kind of frustrating to see them circle back to what I have suspected the entire time but asymptomatic spread is the basis of mask wearing so we best be ditching that now.  Oh wait, it's been two months since he said that and we are still doing the same bullshit.</p>

        <p>Here's the kicker with asx transmission.  If it is significant, then this means the actual number of people who've had the virus was an order of magnitude higher back in 2020.  This was supported by antibody tests.  Might still be that high now idk.</p>
<p>That drops your mortality rate dramatically.  More caeses, same deaths, easy math.  Too bad that gets glossed over, but it will dawn on the masses eventually.</p>

        <p>I think because the original tests had such a high false positive rate if you had previously had the virus and not had it at the time of the test, this should've maybe accounted for this? If anyone knows more about this feel free to correct me.</p>

<p>&rt; From FDA.gov:
&rt; From February through the middle of May, the FDA issued a total of 59 EUAs for IVDs for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 based on validation data using contrived specimens derived from SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. As the pandemic progressed and more patient specimens became available, on May 11, 2020, <strong>the FDA recommended in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests that developers obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests.</strong> So just from Feb-May 59 tests were authorized (so how many since then?) and the FDE recommended testing against real samples.  </p>
<p><strong>I can’t believe they would actually allow test developers to obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests without isolating, purifying and examining under an electron microscope. UNREAL.</strong>  </p>

<hr>
<p>&rt; “I think if a country said, “You know, we need to end this epidemic,” They could quietly send around a memo saying: “We shouldn’t be having the cutoff at 37. If we put it at 32, the number of positive tests drops dramatically. If it’s still not enough, well, you know, 30 or 28 or something like that. So, you can control the sensitivity.”  </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">Yes, you read that right. Labs can manipulate how many “cases’ of Covid-19 their country has. Is this how the Chinese made their case load vanish all of a sudden?</a>  </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”  </p>
<p>&rt;But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rt;Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  </p>
<p>&rt;But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like <a href="https://bpa-pathology.com/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/">“No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification”</a>   </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Countless labs have reported a 100 percent positivity rate, which means every single person tested was positive. Other labs had very high positivity rates. FOX 35 News found that testing sites like one local Centra Care reported that 83 people were tested and all tested positive. Then, NCF Diagnostics in Alachua reported 88 percent of tests were positive.  </p>
<p>&rt;How could that be? FOX 35 News investigated these astronomical numbers, contacting every local location mentioned in the report.  </p>
<p>&rt;The report showed that Orlando Health had a 98 percent positivity rate. However, when FOX 35 News contacted the hospital, they confirmed errors in the report. <a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-florida-department-of-health-says-some-labs-have-not-reported-negative-covid-19-results">Orlando Health's positivity rate is only <strong>9.4 percent, not 98 percent</strong> as in the report.</a>   </p>

<p>&rt;Development of new vaccine technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current RNA based SARS- CoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing. In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients. The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations. In the current analysis a total of sixteen UG tandem repeats (ΨGΨG) were identified and additional UG (ΨG) rich sequences were identified. Two GGΨA sequences were found. Potential G Quadruplex sequences are possibly present but a more sophisticated computer program is needed to verify these. Furthermore, the spike protein, created by the translation of the vaccine RNA, binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a zinc containing enzyme. This interaction has the potential to increase intracellular zinc. Zinc ions have been shown to cause the transformation of TDP-43 to its pathologic prion configuration. The folding of TDP-43 and FUS into their pathologic prion confirmations is known to cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases. The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.  </p>

        <p>How do people put up with these complete 180s and not see that the story changes to accomodate shut downs? Between this and where he’s saying masks aren’t necessary... Do people actually think it’s only a coincidece that “the science” has been updated at the same time as the largest transfer of wealth we’ve ever seen? 
I got hit with “the science” line the other day by my 70s ultra liberal landlord. Her and her husband locked themselves in for over a year, feeding off the news 3x per day. People like this want to tell me how bad the virus is, when I’ve been going to work every single day of the lockdowns, interacting with people, and only know a few people who think they’ve had mild cases... She got pretty worked up too, all because I mentioned we were hesitant to get the vaccine (which sugarcoat for over my dead body). I could tell her ideas were threatened as she spouted off like 5 platitudes in quick succession “It’s safe we didn’t have any side effects, our daughter got it, we listed to Fauci who do you listen to? He’s the top doctor in the world” - and I’m just silent, acting oblivous. “Oh really??”</p>

        <p>January of last year.  It was echoed in June by the WHO, who then immediately walked it back.</p>
<p>In March, Fauci said it was unnecessary for healthy people to wear masks.  He then went on to say he only said that to save PPE for medical staff.  But as the science now says, 100,000's of lives are saved by wearing masks.  So from March to the time he did a 180, he is personally responsible for an uncountable number of deaths.  Kind of counter-intuitive too, really.  Could have saved the medical staff an untold number of patients showing up at hospital.</p>
<p>Also said that any facial covering will do because they block respiratory droplets, but apparently didn't know that in March.  This was his great revelation in 40 years as a doctor.  I could have told you that and sometimes I don't wear pants all day.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long answer.</p>

        <p>Maria Van Kerkhove didn't really 'walk it back' though, but you'd think she did by the way it was reported, and the headlines.  Listen carefully, she said the studies in Singapore and other places indicated asymptomatic spread is rare..... in the 'walk it back' part the next day she reiterated that, but added a caveat.... something about how we still speculate it might not be yada yada.  So the media ran with the 'speculate' part, and that's what most people heard.</p>

        <p>It's pretty well accepted that asymptomatic people do not spread the virus. However, most people don't understand what "asymptomatic" means. Asymptomatic means you do not and will not ever experience any symptoms at all. </p>
<p>What IS true is that <strong>people who do not feel sick spread the virus</strong>. Those people are <em>not necessarily "asymptomatic:"</em> they may go on to develop symptoms, or have mild symptoms they do not yet associate with being sick (e.g., fatigue, headache, scratchy throat).</p>

        <p>That’s one cohort of 59 people. And if presx transmission is truly prevalent in the population at large, I’d like to know how this differs significantly  from any other respiratory infection. The response to this virus has been and continues to be absurd.</p>

        <p>To be fair, COVID may well be revealing we should be doing things like wearing masks more often for other types of respiratory viruses. This is commonplace in East Asia, for example. When I last visited Japan 3 years ago many people just wear masks in public as a matter of politeness. Of course I admit that doesn't justify mandating them.</p>

        <p>While I think masks  for healthy people do more harm than good, I appreciate the civil discussion. Kind of rare on social media.</p>

        <p>Remember guys, only cherry pick what scientists tell you as long as it supports your claim. It doesn’t matter what the actual science is, just use it when it suits you. /s</p>

        <p>This is not cherry picking; this is pointing out Fauci's total reversal from well-established science regarding respiratory diseases.</p>

        <p>Guess you didn’t realize this is satire. Nice job, buddy. If you read this critically however, you would have realized I was making fun of the people who no matter what scientifically proven facts you present them, they completely disregard anything you said because it doesn’t support their narrative.</p>
