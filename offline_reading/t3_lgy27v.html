    <strong>Thoughts from an ICU worker</strong>
    <p><p>This originally started as a comment to a separate post, but I didn't want to hijack OP's post with this long rant. I'll try to make this not too rambly or long, but please read fully before commenting or downvoting. I'll open by saying: fuck dancing TikTok nurses.</p>
<p>So the original post was "how has your mind changed about this whole thing since last year." My short and sweet answer is: at the start of this, early spring last year, I was on board. Ok we lockdown for two weeks, we wear the mask, and we will be back at it. Hell, even if takes a month, then we can go back to normal life. They told us it was to not overwhelm the hospitals. It's plain as day now: <em>this has all been a farce.</em> It should have been easy to see this would be used as a power grab.</p>
<p>So to get this out of the way: whatever it is, is real. It's real in the sense that the symptoms, in critically ill ICU patients, manifests itself differently than say the regular flu. Now whether this was a Chinese bioweapon, an accidental spread from a wet market, etc. it is foreign and new. Yes, the media is dramatizing the extent of it, but I have seen first-hand people become very ill and die from it. I feel sympathy for anyone who has lost a loved one or friend to this. <strong>The disease itself is not the hoax,</strong> <strong><em>the reaction is</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I'd like to point out some main themes (without getting too far into it, I could talk about this all day) that shows how this was used, and still is used, as a power-grab for the neo-liberal Establishment, and is aided and abetted by the "free press" in the USA.</p>
<p>- <em>"For the hospitals":</em> The whole reason this lockdown started was to "not overwhelm the hospitals." That's how they branded it. I work at a pretty big hospital in my region. We have not been overwhelmed since last spring (and that is only because we took patients in from other areas.) Even during this "worse than ever before" wave we're currently in- we are not overwhelmed. The hospital capacity has been hovering around 75-80% since November. We never broke 85% capacity. Numbers have been steadily declining since early January. The "covid ICU" is now half-covid patients, half regular patients we'd have any other winter with other issues. Over the course of the summer and early autumn we had one or two Covid patients in the ICU at any given time. Sometimes we had none.</p>
<p>- <em>"Riots: state-approved pandemic activities":</em> Ah the gaslighting. This is the catalyst that changed my mind. Thousands can go in the streets- scream, assault people, burn businesses down; to the Establishment this was necessary (their words) but other activities were not "state approved." Attending a small, masked funeral for a loved one? Superspreader. Small wedding? Superspreader. Riding a motorcycle? Superspreader. Visiting a dying loved one? Superspreader. Our hospital had some pretty barbaric visitation rules early on in this pandemic. Patients died without a family member/spouse/friend present. No one allowed in. Thankfully those barbaric rules have changed now and are more compassionate. But let's go back to last spring. It's ok for thousands to go into tightly-packed urban streets and yell at the same time you're telling people they can't see a dying loved one (even with a mask and full PPE.) To be ok with that takes serious balls or serious cognitive dissonance. The mayor of NYC attended a gay pride parade as his city had the highest numbers in the country. The media, as per usual, set the narrative. "These things are ok, because we say so, but the things we don't approve: well you're all evil grandma-killing bioterrorists." Remember when a woman without a mask was dining alone outside and because she was not rioting with BLM/Antfa she was surrounded by a mob of people, up in her face, screaming at her? In a sane world, one that truly cared about the pandemic, we'd call THAT a superspreader. Not people walking their dogs outside. Remember BLM/Antifa spitting on cops outside the RNC? The news didn't even so much as acknowledge it. The "science" (more like politicized bought &amp; paid for pseudo-science) can try and say "there's no known cases tied to protests/riots" all they want- but guess what? Contact tracers in states like NY and CA were legally not allowed to ask non-violent protestors if they had been to a protest. Violent rioters obviously aren't even going to answer the phone when a contact tracer called, even if they were allowed to ask.</p>
<p>- <em>"Election":</em> I get this is a contentious issue, and this is not meant to be a political post, but just hear out this one main point that should get the noggin' joggin' and I'll move on. For months leading up to the election we heard "WE NEED MAIL IN VOTING! YOU CAN'T EXPECT US TO SPREAD DISEASE BY GOING IN PERSON!" Well, we got mail-in voting and what did the CDC say on 11/2/20, four days before the election? "Even if you are under quarantine for Covid or have Covid symptoms, you can still go vote in person." Absolute madness. I'll leave it at that and let you make of that what you will.</p>
<p>- <em>"Big Pharma &amp; Corporations":</em> pharmaceutical companies get rich by developing new drugs, not with already existing meds. An already existing drug, Ivermectin, has shown great promise in stopping the disease from going from a mild case to a severe one. So much so doctors went to Congress last November and PLEADED that they review the data. I have yet to see a patient on it where I am, but others have used it with pretty promising results. Ivermectin, vitamin D, zinc, going outside (vitamin D, the sun, hello! maybe this is why cases in the summer plummeted?), and regular exercise would all GREATLY improve outcomes. But there's no money to be made in that. There's no money in telling people to exercise and eat healthy. The "vaccine" (shouldn't even be legally be allowed to be called that) is where the money is for Big Pharma and we can't have this whole charade ending before they're able to get their billions in profits, right? As offspring of small business owners: fuck these corporations that made billions then preach to us that we're not doing enough. Fuck them, the government, and the media for all teaming up to take out the little guy even more and take out small businesses. Am I more likely to get Covid in the local hardware store rather than Home Depot? No, everyone knows that.</p>
<p>- <em>"Outdoor dining":</em> Last one then I gotta go. Ok outdoor dining, good concept for the summer- get people outdoors there's more ventilation, more sunlight- great. Oh shit winter is here, now what? Oh I got an idea! Let's put people in a small, non-ventilated plastic bubble that is SMALLER and less LESS ventilated than the dining room of the restaurant! They can all re-breathe their own air, and not only that, the waitresses and busboys can come in the bubble and breathe it too! Genius!</p>
<p>- EDIT: actual last one because this one is important and I forgot. We've seen an uptick in suicide attempts and drug/alcohol ODs since this all started. I don't think that's a coincidence. You're telling people they can't see anyone, they can't work, they can't have social hobbies, they'll get covid if they exercise or go outside, etc. Well what do you think is gonna happen? Humans are social beings. Humans need a purpose. I completely believe the "cure has been worse than the disease itself." Those words ring true to me now. We're at the point we're cutting our nose off to spite our face. Sure, "correlation doesn't equal causation" but when you tell people to sit inside all day with no purpose of course they're going to resort to drugs/alcohol if they're already pre-disposed to living that way.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I could go on &amp; on, but you all already know. Be good to each other out there, stay safe, keep calling out this upside-down clown world bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>I don’t feel like anybody with any sense states that virus does not exist, it definitely does. People in my circle have passed from COVID and its extremely maddening that the media turns them into martyrs for their insidious agenda. Good people, turned into propaganda. You are spot on when you state that the reaction is the problem. Social distancing? Does more harm than good. The theory is good but it is not sustainable. Cloth masks? Come on man. My 2 year old could figure out a mask is bullshit. Anyone who says they work either does not know or is in on the lie.</p>

        <p>Sorry for your losses. My grandfather died from Covid because our government thought it'd be a genius idea to put Covid patients in nursing homes/rehab facilities. Very sick for these peoples' lives used as propaganda for the elitist oligarchs.</p>
<p>There are some people that state the virus is not real. They say because it has not been isolated/a Koch's postulate fulfilled. And they're right in that regard, but they're wrong on why IMO. Think about it, isolating it would lead to two things: more accurate tests &amp; a traditional vaccine (weakened strain put in body for antibodies). They're making billions in the never-before used mRNA vaccines and they <em>want</em> the tests to be inaccurate. False positives = higher case numbers = more fear/panic = more justification for lockdowns = they make more money and have more power. If we had 99-100% accurate tests the jig would be up. It's the same reason they pushed "asymptomatic spread" so hard. I've been around coworkers for full 12 hour shifts in tight quarters who wound up getting Covid a day or two later, this when they weren't symptomatic/before they knew they had it, and a lot of us never got ill.</p>
<p>Cloth masks are the biggest joke. Any time tell me people cloth masks "at least do something" I tell them to wear their cloth mask in front of their bathroom mirror when they have to sneeze. Look at the mirror after, you'll have to Windex it down. These are the same people telling us to follow the science. If a drop so small only a microscope can see it than why are we playing this charade with masks with holes big enough to spit through?</p>

<p>Not to mention the amount of times people fidget with their masks. I'm a barista and the amount of times myself and my coworkers touch the front of our masks and then hand people coffees, pastries, change etc.  I'm surprised its not spreading more.</p>

        <p>Absolutely excellent! Yeah, the outdoor dining with plastic is a funny one. I swear, some of these practices almost seem like they WANT it to spread more to get the numbers up. </p>
<p>One thing I don't understand is: If an old person is dying in a hospital or nursing home, why can't people who are healthy and young visit and comfort that person during their final days? The person who is most vulnerable is already dying. Now the family has to go on living with guilt &amp; resentment for not being able to be there. It should be their choice and the choice of the person who's dying. They can still take precautions. It's just so infuriating.</p>

        <p>Great post! As a fellow healthcare worker (I work in emergency department) I concur with all that you are saying. Especially your last point about an increase in suicide attempts and ODs. We have also seen a significant rise. We even had a 13 year old boy in the other day who slit his wrists as he could not live through this pandemic and the relentless and never ending lockdowns that come along with it. Now if that doesn’t sum up the damage that this is doing to people, especially our young and vulnerable, then I don’t know what does. It’s terribly sad</p>

        <p>Exactly. As you said:  "<em>this has all been a farce.</em> It should have been easy to see this would be used as a power grab";  "<strong>The disease itself is not the hoax,</strong> <strong><em>the reaction is</em></strong>".  </p>
<p>The classic formula of: "Create a problem &rt; wait for people reaction &rt; offer a solution" </p>
<p>The solution is something horrible that people would never accept under normal conditions, that's why this sibylline strategy is used: you create an artificial problem and use social engineering to your advantage, wait for people to gladly take your horrible solution and beg you on their knees to be applied.</p>
<p>A power grab, more control over people, the violation of individual freedoms and our fundamental rights, change and application of tyrannical laws, more power for the police to enforce it, violation of our privacy, internet censorship, single thought in the mainstream media. The excuse is a deadly virus, inject fear into people minds in a year of incessant propaganda from the mass media, because people who are afraid are easy to control, repeat a lie a thousand times and it will come true, make this grain of sand as big as the moon and soon people will accept anything without question it. Just like Malcolm X said:  </p>
<h1>“If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”</h1>
<p>The mass media have played a fundamental role here, we must also denounce this, they all are also part of this snowball getting so big, they work for the elite, they all manipulate us, they all are playing with us to achieve their own interests. With politics is the same history, everyone works for the same ringmaster, we have to denounce this now too and start to wake up, critical thinking and questioning everything, this is the era of great deception. This is a world war and is happening right now, the war of the 1% against us the 99%.</p>

        <p>Yeah I definatelly agree the disease is real, I have relatives in the hospital right now. But everything else absilutely is, you put it all into words very well.</p>
<p>Also, </p>
<p>&rt;going outside (vitamin D, the sun, hello! maybe this is why cases in the summer plummeted?), and regular exercise would all GREATLY improve outcomes.</p>
<p>I can't stress this enough, PEOPLE ARE WEAKENING THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS in the face of a new disease, and everybody is just ok with it. Please if you read this, go outside and get some sun.</p>

        <p>Very well written. Thank you for articulating all the things I have been feeling/thinking.</p>
<p>I'm a nurse as well. I believe COVID is real. I've seen it. However the response, the widespread hysteria is not warranted. </p>
<p>I'm sick and tired of hearing people defend the extreme lockdowns. I can't even talk to my coworkers about a restaurant I ate at on the weekend (in a mask with distancing enforced) because most of them are so scared and haven't left their house since March. </p>
<p>I got backlash for my wedding in May (downsized and only 40 people with distanced seating) If I had waited to get married until COVID went away like certain fearful people in my life were telling me to do, I still wouldn't be married. </p>
<p>I'm curious to see more about the results of Ivermectin but I somehow doubt people will give it a chance. I have only seen it given once at work and the MD only ordered it because the family insisted. </p>
<p>Of course the media would rather promote a vaccine (a questionable one at that, for which I'm currently being bullied for not taking) instead of healthy choices, vitamin D, zinc, and exercise. </p>
<p>I hope people start to wake up to this soon.</p>
<p>Also curious to hear what your opinion is about the flu or lack of cases. I haven't had any flu patients at all this year.</p>

        <p>Very well written! I wish more people realized what this is all about. However, denial is very powerful, especially if it means that people were being manipulated, lied to, and scammed for almost a year. And you know that once enough people get the vaccine, they will need another "booster" for each new variant and to continue with restrictions.</p>

        <p>About the pharma/corporations point:</p>
<p>What grinds my gears is that as you mentioned they make the most money from new drugs. They've been trying for a long time to get DNA/RNA treatments approved with no success, regulatory agencies had no stomach for them and didn't want to take the risks.</p>
<p>Setting aside all questions about who, how or why, the pharma companies have used this opportunity to push through these treatments with zero long term testing, which is why they've now started talking about all their other uses for other diseases.</p>
<p>You exercise caution relative to probable risk. Risk waking around with an ice cream? Low. Low caution. Risk of disaster when messing with DNA? High. High caution. And they used this event to throw it to the wind.</p>

        <p>Yeah as for protests and things, I've always said this: If you want to claim that these things are worth the risk of catching the deadliest virus in history, ok whatever. It's dumb but you know. Just don't claim that they're somehow immune from catching anything.</p>
