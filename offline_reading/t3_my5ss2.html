    <strong>Cure For Covid</strong>
    <p><p>For Sars Cov 2002 and MERS (Previous versions of Co) Pfizer came up with a drug Molnupiravir. Right now they are coming out with PF 07321332. </p>
<p>1 There is 80% similarities between Sars Cov and Cov 2, why isn't Molnupiravir being prescribed and talked about?.</p>
<p>2 what is the cure for cov? 
Looking at various braid spectrum anti virals that bind with spikes of virus, surely pharmas and scientists can come up with a cure.</p>
<p>3 Coronaviruses show up almost every flu season, gives us cold and fever. Surely they have drugs to counter them, why aren't they being mentioned and shared with the world, alongside other suppliments? </p>
<p>4 Vaccine isn't the cure, it just prevents you from having severe illness, so medicine/drugs/immunitybooster are still a huge requirement. Why aren't they being mentioned? 
(Because profit margins in vaccine are 10 times bigger than generic Salt tablets/drugs manufactured in India, Indonesia and Thailand) </p>
<p>What's the Cure of Cov? And why is Sars Cov 2 called 
CovID 19 and not Sars Cov 3? Because MERS is technically Sars Cov 2.</p></p>

        <p>You can only sell a cure to those who are sick enough to consider it worthwhile.</p>
<p>So your profit-margin depends on people actually getting sick and how much these people are willing to pay for a cure.</p>
<p>Now if you get governments around the globe to buy a vaccine for everyone from their tax-money regardless of what it costs, that will obviously generate a larger margin.</p>

        <p>Because there is no Covid,.never was. Its all renaming of flu numbers, false "asymptomatic" positives with bogus PCR tests, and now vaccine reactions (from the non mRNA vaccines which make you sick just like "Covid". mRNA will make you infertile and maybe more later). </p>
<p>They still have not given a single sample of fully isolated "Covid-19 virus". Its all random strands of RNA found in people sick from flu, cold or other things, and sometimes even exist in healthy people.</p>
<p>Can't cure what doesnt exist.</p>
