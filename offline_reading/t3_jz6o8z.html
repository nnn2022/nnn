    <strong>Alcohol Prohibition and Eugenics: Historical Examples of Authoritarianism Coming From Progressives</strong>
    <p><p>Most Americans are aware of the era of alcohol prohibition which lasted from 1920-1933, but what's less well known these days is that Prohibition was very much a progressive cause, framed as being for the good of society. The results ended up awful enough that Progressive fell out of favor, but we're still stuck with the legacy of Prohibition as the same strategy has been used with marijuana and other drugs, as well as there being still some pretty intense bureaucratic red tape around alcohol licensing.</p>
<p>Eugenics was also a cause born from the Progressive movement. For a time between the World Wars, it was common for people to suggest that whichever group of people they didn't like should be sterilized "for the good of society", and every university that wanted to keep up with the times had a eugenics department. We all know now what kind of atrocities can come from eugenics because of what Nazi Germany did with it, but Germany wasn't the only place where it fashionable during that period.</p>
<p>Progressives like to portray themselves as always on the right side of history, but that usually comes with the omission of things that failed miserably like prohibition and eugenics. I notice that the achievements progressives have done in the past that are still widely admired are generally things that have expanded rights rather than taken them away, for instance the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, and the nullification of Jim Crow laws, things which I am personally grateful for. It's when progressives turn authoritarian and try to control people that it goes haywire, and we're living through one of those times right now with this "New Normal"</p></p>

        <p>Be wary of any movement purporting to be for “the greater good.” You’ll find most of these arguments either completely ignore the negative effects of such a change (prohibition is a great example of this), or they benefit only certain groups, while greatly harming others.</p>

        <p>One of the reasons progressives supported women's suffrage was actually because they thought they'd vote for prohibition.</p>
