    <strong>I just watched my neighbor across the street take her trash cans out to the street wearing a mask</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m in my garage working on a project and I hear cans being rolled out so I take a look away from what I’m doing to see who it is, it’s the recluse neighbors across the street who never say hello and wont even wave back when you wave hello to them.  She came out of her own house wearing a mask, rolls her trash cans out to the street and went back inside masked the whole time.  I don’t live in a densely populated area, and there was nobody else around outside.  What is this world coming to?  Do people actually think a thin piece of fabric will keep them safe from getting the flu?</p></p>
