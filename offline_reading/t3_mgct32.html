    <strong>The Covid crisis shows the weakness of representative democracy</strong>
    <p><p>For the representatives it is easier to sell themselves with fear mongering than with rationale, so naturally they'll do that.</p>
<p>It is all about selling, that is why politics has become so PR heavy. It's almost like watching advertisements. No wonder the same agencies advise politicians. Every word, every picture is carefully crafted, like for an advertisement. That is also why actual policies revolve around aesthetics so heavily (PC). It's just the natural result of the constraints of representative politics as described.</p>
<p>And politicians again sell their power to the highest bidder, don't need to go deeper into that I think.</p>
<p>Our democracy is just a shell, and the Covid crisis painfully demonstrates this.</p>
<p>I know I'm hitting a spot with many here saying that, but China seems to be doing better in the regard of political effectiveness although there are congressional democratic processes apart from voting for a party as far as I know - which as for the US is just the illusion of choice anyway. Nothing will ever fundamentally change, and the peoples discontent is channeled into a fraudulent "democratic" process which thus just acts as a stabilizer for the status quo. The corrupt media which are staffed with profiteers of the system help to drive home the message that "the enemy" has it far worse in their inferior system. </p>
<p>Do I want it like in China? Hell no, we can't just take our corrupt society as it is and take away more power from the people. What we need is to give more power to the people, we need transparency and responsibility for the powerful and wealthy. Honestly, I don't see how we can heal without a cultural and political revolution.</p></p>

        <p>if anything we should give less power to the sheeple, sure manipulation bla-bla but they do vote don't they? And they do buy other stuff that is advertised to them. Apart from taking their voting rights the only solutions are mass extermination or better education etc. for next 50 years. Maybe we can relocate them into a mandatory VR reality or a "post-mortem social network".</p>

<p>there is really no answer. Are the people idiots? Mostly, depends a lot on the media though. Are the powerful corrupt? Mostly.</p>
<p>I'd want a dictatorship if the dictator was just. I'd want a democracy if the people could at least freely decide, or let's say if I am okay with the culture I live in. On the extreme I'd want anarchy if people <em>really</em> weren't idiots. Unfortunately all solutions are looking grim right now.</p>
<p>&rt; the only solutions are mass extermination </p>
<p>Going by the conspiracy theories the powerful might be working on that. I don't think that it's fair to say that it's a desirable option. The situation we are in has grown on their shit, or rather their ideology that lead to this exploitation of resources. The agenda they propose, may it sound so humanistic (climate change, technocracy) also would never take away their own power, on the contrary. They try to sell us a society where we give up on personal rights completely. Again, this <em>could</em> be desirable, if the powerful were to be trusted or mechanisms would be in place to keep everything in check. But imo the opposite is the case. </p>
<p>We could live an actual sustainable life without mass extinction but that would require too much change, and too much change scares them (and honestly, change is hard to come by, even for "them"). That's why they likely come up with solutions like "just kill people".</p>
