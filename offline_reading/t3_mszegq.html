        <p>While I disagree with some of your points, I think the general idea is correct, and similar to my own conclusion. A year ago I would have never believed any of this but I had way too many insane experiences both sober and using psychedelics. It’s real and it’s scary and most people will deny it to the death. The sad part is that you and I are not special, these experiences do not require someone’s belief. If more people looked for answers and pushed past the fear, they’d find them. Or at least more questions, lol. Not to downplay how terrifying breakthrough experiences with psychedelics are, it took ALL my willpower to push forward. Due to personal experience I am a firm believer that Christ really is the son of God and walked this earth in the past. I was not religious going in but I hit the motherload of warnings and synchronicities after my last trip where I was possessed by an entity/demon. Not fun and I stopped all my experiments.</p>

        <p>oh wow! sorry to hear that you had to learn in the hard way. hope you are fine now! and yes, i have stopped psychedelics as well (but think about going back for self-healing since i now know how to do shadow work -which i didnt back then - and some traumas still sit so deep i feel this could give me the necessary state of consciousness to get to them..).</p>
<p>the matrix has done a fine job of brainwashing people and disconnecting them from their intuition and higher self. there is almost noone to blame really if he doesnt "get it", its really sad (but honestly i often am still mad at those dumbasses lol).</p>
<p>i agree with christ being the son of god but i will add in contrary to your view, i believe he is nothing so special (altho he ofcourse plays a very special role in this universe and is a mighty galactic being of light) compared to us.. we will once ascend like him and will be able to meet him again, like litterally. he just paved the way for us so that we can follow. we are all sons and daughters of god :) (at least thats how i see it).</p>
<p>have a good one! happy to have met another truly awakened one :)</p>

        <p>I love you sir. We have already won, this chaos we see is like the dying beast in his death throes, thrashing around in one last attempt for survival. They're rushing everything in an attempt to secure their power, and being sloppy and fucking it up, people are becoming aware of the agenda far too quickly for them to keep up with</p>
<p>The people doing this, they may be unaware the roll they really play, for they've always been playing a losing game. Light shall always conquer Dark.</p>
<p>As far as Christ goes, if that's your flavor of belief, by all means dig in. But we are all destined to become Living Gods. At least, the ones of us who use our own willpower to achieve it. Surely though there will be those that dissolve their individuality over and over again until they create one that can take them the entire journey. In the end though we are all shards of God, self discovering our true nature and Power along the way. The Immortal Soul never perishes.</p>
<p>As Above, So Below.</p>

        <p>Very much possible. They have done everything in their power to prevent people from protesting this by closing up all places where people could gather and communicate, like bars and gyms. They have also suppressed protest information and broken up protests for the mere reason of protesting against the lock down. </p>
<p>What is happening very much feels like the first giants step toward mass murder or sterilization with the vaccine. Like they have big plans with this and I wouldn't doubt if they would have also thought of this one and added it just in case.</p>

        <p>That’s just wrong, Islam doesn’t force Women to cover their Faces, only their Hair, covering ones face is is an Arab Cultural thing, and even then the covering of hair isn’t done “to show submission to man and king” it is done for God, and only for God.

        <p>Speak for yourself. I am a self employed business owner, I build things for a living. I write music, read a lot of books, meditate and exercise daily, go out of my way to assist others in fields I am knowledgeable in, and overall enjoy a pretty well rounded and fulfilled life. I have had to work very hard to attain this, it wasn't given to me, but I don't know where you'd get the idea that myself, or even the average person here, its so consumed by "crippling paranoia" that they can't function in the real world. Most of the people here are the hard working conservative type, anyway.</p>
<p>You're just projecting your own beliefs onto other people, and thats never the right thing to do. You suffer from a level of immaturity that is becoming common in young adults today.</p>
<p>What you don't seem to realize is that people can learn to accept the bad things happening in the world and open their eyes and mind to the full picture <em>without</em> letting it destroy them. That is <em>your</em> fear being projected onto other people. But that's not how it works, plenty of us have accepted reality for what it is and work within it, rather than deny it out of fear as people that like to call others "conspiracy theorists" are often guilty of.</p>

        <p>The past year has been undeniably difficult on most people. I had it pretty easy compared to many, so no complaints here.  I disagree that most of the country thinks "I am crazy" or that people against the lockdowns and masks in general are "crazy." </p>
<p>I think thats the propaganda you've been eating up distorting your perception of the world around you. People I come into contact with on a daily basis have never indicated they think I am crazy, and some stranger on the internet holds no sway over how I view myself.</p>
<p>Caring what other people think about you won't get you very far in life.</p>
<p>How many hours a day do you spend on reddit trying to tear other people down in attempts to boost your own self-opinion? Don't you realize how transparent you are?</p>
