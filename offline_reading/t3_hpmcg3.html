    <strong>The new normal *is* desirable to millions of people because their lives outright sucked</strong>
    <p><p>Millions of Americans had terrible lives and quality of lives before the lockdown, especially in regards to work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I  used to get physically ill when I had to drive myself to work. I was  working a degrading job, going to school fulltime, and it was incredibly  draining. being at home has been a lifesaver for me and my mental health, and there are  millions in my situation:terrible job, long commute, draining  schoolwork, stress, unsatisfied with life. Why would we want to go back  to that? Especially people who used to do low wage customer service jobs. Almost every person I worked with in customer service had been hit, screamed at, threatened, called names or racial slurs by customers. Obviously staying at home and getting a check is preferable to <em>that.</em> </p>
<p>I've known people that commuted more than 1-2 hours for jobs that pay slightly above minimum wage. </p>
<p>Obviously, I care about  civil liberties and I don't want the government shutting down our civil  liberties forever, but I am showing the perspective that many do not  see: there were so many miserable people, driving 2-3 hours to a job  they hate that barely pays the bills, why wouldn't they want to stay home and get a check?  especially if you have nice amenities at home, or a decent social life  with your partner/family/roommates, that's much better than getting  yelled at by karens all day or getting bullied by an incompetent boss.</p></p>

        <p>I can see this, but paying people to stay home and not work is not sustainable and already will leave lasting damage. Maybe it will inspire people to switch to a new career.</p>

        <p>That might have been viable before the economic damage done from the shutdown. Now, because of difficulty vetting and hiring, companies are doing so less. Another nail in the coffin is many desirable small businesses are cash poor right now so it’s short term less expensive to have the current workers work extra hours rather than increase the work force in a volatile economic climate.</p>

        <p>All my middle class friends that are scared to death and/or virtue signaling had great lives before the lockdown. Most work from home. They used to have lots of social engagements. Maybe the break from the busyness was nice but you’d think they would be stir crazy by now. (Unless they’re all getting together on the sly and not inviting me). I lost my job. I’m very extroverted. I’m super depressed. After a conversation with my SIL today I realized this will never end. I contemplated just giving up as I feel no hope. </p>
<p>My husband bought me pad Thai and I probably just ate my feelings. But I’m feeling a little better after crying all day. Going to visit mom tomorrow. </p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my pity party.</p>

        <p>I can relate to that. Customer service jobs suck, the mentality of "the customer is always right" incentives people to act very entitled. Ive been yelled at by customers an untold number of times for simply following the rules laid out by my boss, it was especially bad working at a call center where I spent 40 hours a week getting screamed at by irate customers.</p>
<p>When it was at a movie theater, dry cleaners, amusement park, in hindsight, there was never going to be any room for growth within the company. But, even though the call center was the worst, it was an opportunity that allowed me room to grow into a fufilling, lucrative, flexible job.</p>
<p>There should be more jobs that let us work from home, its obvious that due to the pandemic, more people will be able to work from home once this is over.</p>
<p>What we cant do long term is pay millions of people to not work. SOMEONE has to work, to grow food, deliver the food, build houses, maintain roads in order to deliver the food and housing supplies, the list could go on and on. </p>
<p>Incentivizing people not to work, by paying them more than they made before (CARES Act), is also going to lead to inflation, so the people not working right now are going to be worse off in the long run with reduced purchasing power.</p>

        <p>OP proves what I’ve been saying.  This has NOTHING to do with a virus or saving lives.  It’s a bunch of selfish people looking for an easy way to sit at home and live off of the taxes of people still working.  It’s pure selfishness.  People are dying due to delayed medical procedures. People are losing everything they’ve worked for.   Why?  Because some lazy, selfish idiots don’t want to go to work.   Pure selfishness.  Sickening.</p>

        <p>I imagine most of us on this sub have worked terrible jobs before.   It's not "selfish" to feel relief, like OP, at leaving a stressful situation.  </p>
<p>It is selfish to expect society to give you a paycheck for staying at home, though.  And to be OK with other people losing their businesses and jobs because you happened to hate yours.</p>

        <p>Here is my stance. If the government makes it impossible for you to work to gain meaningful wage, as in this economic shutdown, they have an obligation to pay until they restrictions are lifted. Abruptly shutting down the economy was thrust onto the people so temporary relief is needed. Also we may need to rethink how we see things if economic levels don’t go back to where they were, simply put less jobs that have a living wage will be available. </p>
<p>I don’t know how we pull out of this tail spin, but the simple pull yourself up by the bootstraps answer will not work</p>

        <p>It’s not that simple. Fear is a major reason. The news cycle and social media have turned the fear porn to 11 and people are believing the air is poison. We know it’s not but that’s not what the news is telling people. If people think leaving their house will kill them, a business or economy doesn’t seem important. The largest problem is the media and the misinformation, not people being selfish.</p>

        <p>It’s the attitude that this lockdown is ok if you get to stay home.  I used to work retail and stock shelves and shit.  Then I worked in a call center taking calls from people who’s gas was shutoff. It sucked.  I took a job paying less than that one because the job paid less but I could learn a skill.  So I took it.  It sucked.  It was hard.  It was physical.  It was a lot of responsibility.  It was the hardest job I ever had and paid less than a call center.  I saw people quit after weeks or months.  But I worked hard to learn as much as I could.  I lived off of cheap food.  The apartment I rented was freezing in the winter because I couldn’t afford to turn the heat up.  I slept in layers of clothes and a winter hat.  I didn’t have spending money but I knew it would pay off because a job would come open somewhere else eventually.  I eventually found that job minus all of the hard physical labor and it pays pretty well for a non-college grad in this area.  So well that I’ll probably never want to look elsewhere.  I got hired because I learned so much while I was breaking my back to get it.  I never wanted to shutdown and go sit home because it was hard.  I wanted to learn and work towards my goals.  My dad worked hard his whole life and never made very much.  He only ever wanted to go to an NHL game.  Finally I went from not being able to heat the house to being able to but my dad NHL tickets which meant the world to him.  And it got canceled because of lockdown.  And now people want to stay locked down forever so people can’t enjoy what they’ve earned and so others can’t even work towards their goals.  All because some retail kids want a break?   Fuck everything we’ve worked for.   Crash the whole economy because working retail sucks.  It’s a shitty attitude and it doesn’t get my sympathy.</p>

        <p>So unemployment is at historic levels.  And it will only increase as the lockdown continues.  And you think a collapsed economy and high unemployment is going to make better jobs and wages available to you?  You just said you couldn’t find a decent job before this.  Wait until shit is open again and the unemployment rate is 25%.  You’ll be lucky to be back at your old job because many people won’t.  And they’ll all be applying for what’s available.  This lockdown killed all that fight for 15 shit.  When jobs are scarce and unemployment high, wages and opportunities don’t get better.  They should teach that at your school.</p>

        <p>So now everyone has to put their life on hold. Children can’t have friends and grow up.  People are losing everything they worked for.  People are dying because they can’t get treatments or screenings for illnesses.  And that’s all worth it to some losers that don’t like their jobs and want to stay home.  No thanks.  People are already fed up with the lockdown and the only thing that is going to happen is there will be less economic opportunity when this is over.</p>

        <p>Yeah OP is a little off the rails here. Everyone is at a different point. Maybe OP likes the all-inclusive paid vacation provided by people who still have to work, but the kid with alcoholic and abusive parents isn't having a ton of fun with permanent lockdown and homeschooling. And maybe I have a nice white collar job (that still was never WFH during this whole thing), but think about how degrading it is compared to being a trust fund baby who gets to do whatever he wants all day? Yup, life pretty much sucks. So burn it all down?</p>

        <p>I don’t like that things are this way, but you speak the truth. This is probably why the “new normal” crowd are so quick to call others “selfish” it’s classic DARVO- deny accusations reverse victim and offender. It’s also projection.</p>

        <p>The problem isn't a new one.  Many know that Thoreau's quote: "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation..." but haven't read the remainder: "What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things."  Why is that?  I think it's the human condition to not be satisfied, and to strive for better--even when simply staying the course and chilling out is the better option (this isn't always the case).  But why do so man of us choose to live on top of each other, spending an hour to go a few miles instead of just walking or biking, or living a simpler life?  Frankly, I think a perk of any proposed 'new normal' is that you get to choose how you want to spend the rest of your time.  It's a reset.</p>

<p>No one will ever criticize you for working hard.</p>
<p>But you want to stay home and mooch off others who are out working hard? My sympathies for poor little you and your poor little tough life end the second you have the government reach its hand into my pocket and forcibly take my money to give to you to lay around and watch Netflix all day. Guess what kid, everyone has had to suck shit at least once in their life to pay their bills. You're not unique, you're not special</p>

        <p>Yeah, and society needs to say fuck off to people like you.  In this country, you get paid a market rate, and not what you "feel" you should get paid.  There are ways to get wages to rise, but that conversation never gets taken seriously because it goes against the open-border socialist agenda.  If you truly cared about civil liberties, you wouldn't want to force other people to pay your way through life while you sit at home.</p>
