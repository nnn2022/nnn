    <strong>This pandemic has just showed how many people were leading hollow, aimless lives.</strong>
    <p><p>I was alone with my thoughts (as a lot of us are in this hellhole called Ontario), and i was thinking: "These lockdowns have taken everything out of life that makes it worth living. I haven't seen a stranger's smile in months and no communal activities have taken place in the better part of the past year. Why do people put up with this?" And then it hit me. A lot of those people who support these lockdowns didn't have a purpose in their lives. They had no good familial bonds, no community they were apart of. They were just going through the motions, hating every moment of it cause they had no <em>reason to be</em>. So the lockdowns are perfect for them! they don't have to go through the motions anymore and their new reason to be is to tell others to mask up and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It makes me sad really, that people were leading such terrible live that all it took was a bit of media propaganda to get them to accept this dystopian nightmare. No gestapo, KGB, CIA, or actual threat. Just some words on a screen and poof, there goes your life. But i'm certain that all those <em>absolutely trustworthy</em> individuals in the media would be quick to call me an alt-right Trump loving white supremacist. And we know how the sheep love their talking heads. Thus i'll let you guys be the judge. Am i on to something here?</p></p>

        <p>No doubt. It has been compared to religion for while. Iâ€™ve noticed, most (not all, but most) of the people that I know who are obsessed with the pandemic are not religious people at all. They have no purpose for their existence.</p>

        <p>When a people become godless they lose their moral compass, their moral fiber. This whole thing is the result of subverting people's faith in a higher power in favor of blind faith in authority trough public education. Seeing it all play out almost makes you wish you were blissfully ignorant</p>

        <p>As a muslim, it's good that we can come together against the mindless masses attacking us all the time. I am extremely grateful for even being able to be religous, it is truly a gift in and of itself</p>

        <p>Despite being Canadian, I grew up with a lot of arabes, mainly Algerians. I can't speak for all, but the muslims i was raised with were for the most part loyal, honest men (expect for that one Turkish kid lol). I could compare this to the other white Canadians who didn't grow up religious and many years later i can see that they ended up as degenerates in most cases. Having a guiding set of principles in life is most certainly a blessing.</p>

        <p>I consider myself a home-body. I do like to be at home more than in a bar or other social situations. At first, I did see it as a good, justified excuse to stay in. But even I can see this isn't healthy and I can at least recognize that government control is bad. I would never want things to stay shut down cause it legitimizes my normal way of life. Nobody else should want that either.  This is serious. It's ruining lives. Many small businesses are done.... Many people committed suicide.</p>

        <p>I usually stayed inside during spring and fall due to some pretty rough allergies, and i definitely don't spend my time out partying. My friends and family kept telling me that lockdown was a good thing for me. Truth is i'd take the bad allergies over the anti-social distancing and masking <em>any</em> day. You're absolutely right this has ruined and ended far too many lives.</p>

        <p>Could you people stop falling for the trap that there is a growing and dangerous "alt right" in Canada? The far right are a bunch of alienated weirdos disconnected from the mainstream and very few and far between. The "Alt Right" was funded by the CIA to discredit Trump's midterms and comprised entirely of stupid people and government leaders.  They really do not exist in Canada, this is not remotely part of the milieux.  Opposition to mass migration is sensible and normal if you actually understood the stakes and not just a bunch of state propaganda.</p>
<p>It amazes me how you can go to events with supposed "anti-establishment" woke protesters and they will buy the line on immigration hook line and sinker, because a bunch of propaganda finger traps caught them in college.</p>
<p>Mass migration is not a net positive for ANYONE but the ruling class, the richest 1% who are creating a feudal economy through rentierism by inflating the price of land. It is only being pushed by the (neo)liberal parties across north america to destroy the power of labor, destroy the political influence of conservative politics, and create a one party state regardless of the social costs. And we know the costs are enormous, multicultural states are known historically for being cauldrons of violence and dictatorship. They are the source of most modern wars. Strong evidence shows that racism is not only genetic, but extremely pronounced in the people we are bringing in. Strong evidence shows that social cohesion in a community collapses the more it diversifies. Ever since the 60's America has been trying to integrate black-white relations and every attempt has collapsed until now, where it is literally just divide and rule politics. Stop believing a bunch of government lies, you don't have to want a KKK ethnostate (and I don't) to understand that this will utterly destroy the fabric of western society and is being done knowingly for this purposes.</p>
<p>Do you want to live in Brazil? Do you want to live in the former Yugoslavia? Do you want to live in India where there's a racial caste system going back millennia? Do you want to live in a failed state? Why do you supposed CrItIcAl ThInKeRs continue to live in the lie that this position has to be reducible to irrational racism? Don't you understand the exact same thought policing is being used to control the sheep with the vaccine by framing resistance as AnTiVaX? Are you stupid?</p>
