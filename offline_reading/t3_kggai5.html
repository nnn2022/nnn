    <strong>I’m enjoying the hell out of the lockdowns myself.</strong>
    <p><p>The economy, not the lockdown, is the reason why my company is still closed.</p>
<p>as for the rest I’m loving it. Spent all summer doing everything I wanted to do. Fishing, prospecting, picking wild plants. It was great. Wife didn’t bug me about going out, friends didn’t bug me about going out. It was solid me time 100% and it’s still going on. I just spent yesterday morning in the woods. Just me and my rifle. Sometimes you need to find the positives in things.</p></p>

        <p>That's pretty difficult when most people:</p>
<p>- Can't socialize due to lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>- Can't check out clubs or organizations for things that may interest them since they are closed.</p>
<p>- Can't investigate new hobbies or buy supplies because stores are closed.</p>
<p>- Can't afford anything except the bare minimum to keep a roof over their heads on food on their table.</p>
<p>I agree with the others here - you are beyond blessed to be in a rural area where you can come and go as you like, commune with nature, and find simple ways to indulge yourself and make a few bucks.</p>
<p>Some dude living in a 400 square foot studio apartment is going to be having a way less pleasant experience than yours.</p>

        <p>Every Saturday night I get on a zoom call with some of my old military friends. We drink, laugh and swap stories. So technology has helped with that. Never did like clubs, they were an obligation to them. You also don’t always need money or special supplies for a hobby.</p>
<p>I could be living in the middle of a major city in a tiny apartment and feel the same way. It’s a state of mind</p>

        <p>I definitely know what you mean, I don’t know why I was complaining. For me it’s a time poverty thing, the way I used to spend my small amount of free time was coaching my sons’ baseball teams, photography and videography, and self development. Covid for me has caused my schedule to be busier, and I have less free time now. But you’re right, it’s all about what you make it, and I don’t want to be defined by what I can’t do.</p>

        <p>All things you could have done still if we weren’t locked down. </p>
<p>I’m happy you found the positives, I think that’s great, but so many lost everything and had lives destroyed. I was so depressed I was suicidal for a while. I have family friends who lost their 30 year old business and had to sell their house and move into a friend’s basement for the time being. My family was in a very bad spot ourselves financially due to my dad losing his job and mine being delayed.  Those who weren’t negatively affected have no place saying lockdowns are a good thing, in my opinion.</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing "beautiful" in the destruction of our liberties taking place before our very eyes. Soon they will come for the things you love doing, too.</p>
<p>No one will be allowed to have their "normal", whatever that normal may be. That's the whole point of the exercise.</p>

        <p>How do you think I bought my fishing and hunting license this year. I lost about 60% of my income but I have always lived frugally. </p>
<p>In April and may I picked morel mushrooms and sold them to a local store for $20 a pound. In may I picked ramps (leeks) and sold them to the same place for $1.50 a pound. Then I did some prospecting for people in June for a few bucks. That bought me my fishing license.</p>
<p>In August I picked blackberries and sold them for $5 a gallon. In September I picked gensing and sold some of it, the rest I’m selling next week to buy Christmas presents. Those 2 things bought my hunting license.</p>
<p>In between I have been reloading ammo and scraping metals.</p>
<p>So no I’m not privileged and yes I worry about money. I’m getting to the point I’ll have to dig into my retirement savings. I already sold everything I could sell</p>

        <p>Good on you for being resourceful (and that’s not me being sarcastic) but I get so tired of people telling me to be positive about this shit. But throughout this whole time, I have not been able to do any of the things I want. I have been helping family pay bills or make rent since they have been laid off, or pay for their daycare since their kid’s schools have closed. I’m lucky and blessed to still be working but I have lost money due to helping family, and I don’t care because it’s family. </p>
<p>But when I see posts about people who have the luxury to go out in nature and hike, or fish... and get told to look for that “silver lining” I get very frustrated because not all of us have that opportunity.</p>

        <p>Well fishing is free. Hiking is free. Find a good book. I rediscovered my passion for reading. Lots of free books on amazon. They generally aren’t that good but it’s an escape for a while.</p>
<p>I grew up dirt poor being resourceful was how I survived. I just thought this threat would start with other people sharing how they have found some enjoyment, not matter how small. I am lucky I have a guarenteed check, but it isn’t much. I even had to take my car off the road because I can’t afford the insurence on it</p>
