    <strong>Local Politician is Mad at Vaccinated for Throwing Their Masks Away</strong>
    <p><p>Honestly what do they expect?</p>
<p>I have already seen vaccinated people with others on Zoom in the same room who have ditched their masks.</p>
<p>I believe most people never investigated the vaxx and would say mRNA WHAT? and believe the vaccine now leaves them free and clear--totally immune and unable to spread Covid.</p>
<p>But in the cluster confusion of Covid, nothing makes sense, and this local politician posted, get your masks back on even with the vaccine you can still spread Covid.</p>
<p>All of this probably makes our heads hurt. </p>
<p>From what I can see the vaccinated believe they are free and clear and have thrown their masks away and are going out to eat, and hanging out with other people.</p></p>

        <p>In fact, the vaccinated should add a fourth mask to prevent spreading the zombie infection to us. ðŸ˜‰</p>

        <p>Laboratory rats shouldn't be acting like the peril is past us... the shots have been released to be used experimentally on the public while governments, workplaces, and public venues work to justify institutional economic coercion to induce more to take the serum so the sample group is larger- giving researchers better data tp judge actual efficacy and safety.</p>
<p>The true measure of the experiment may be less the therapeutic value of what's being injected and more toi gauge the willingness of people to take the injections- albeit with a small measure of "encouragement".  In no way can lifting restrictions be an end game.  As much as the swarm of citizen insects allow, the rules, distancing, and masks are here to stay.</p>

        <p>The fun is seeing that all the theater was just that. Selfish assholes, the lot of them. Now they believe they can't get sick &amp; are just carriers to give diseases to others- PARTYTIME!!!!!!!! Bunch of MFing Typhoid Marys. </p>
<p>The rest of us just have to hope for the light at the end of the tunnel isn't an oncoming train though. IF almighty Fucki &amp; Billy-boy Gates don't dream up a new scam, as more of these MFers get their freak on, they have to end the pointless lock-downs. </p>
<p>They won't though. Power is too addicting! So, tough shit all the jabbed cunts! It's all for naught because the shit will never fucking end.</p>

        <p>Some are warning these vaccinated people are going to produce worse strains. I don't know. Right now I question the talk of all the variants. All I do know is they have thrown the masks away and are openly hanging out with each other. I mean if most of the vaccinated people are going to return to "normal life" won't the lock downs fail by attrition. They ARE NOT WEARING MASKS with each other or when going out.  I already see this on facebook and Zoom.</p>

        <p>It's the insanity of the whole story. By the 'official story', getting the jab ONLY means you might not die when you get Covid. It does not mean you won't get it, spread it or not be affected, or maybe even die anyway. So, those who immediately dump the mask after the jab are saying "I hope I kill you!" </p>
<p>Now, in reality, the lockdowns &amp; masks don't actually do much of anything. Florida isn't worse than NY or CA... There is supposedly a "British variant", despite Britain locking down so hard they outlawed even having sex with anyone you don't live with!</p>

        <p>Yeah they are walking around with no masks, maybe wearing them only in stores that "require one" but that's it. I think the majority as I said, don't understand this vaccine does not make you immune and does not stop transmission. I find myself thinking the vaccinations are going to make everything worse.</p>
