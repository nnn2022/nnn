    <strong>A nurse and myself had a convo I’d like everyone’s thoughts.</strong>
    <p><p>I have a friend that’s a medical nurse in the ER. She claimed her, “family friend developed an arrhythmia and had to be hospitalized twice and is now permanently on heart meds with atrial fibrillation from this vaccine.”</p>
<p>And that “Women are miscarrying and also becoming infertile.“ </p>
<p>I replied with “I can’t find anyone else seeing a correlation or a causation between a-fib and this vaccine. Is this the only case you’ve seen of this? Also, in regards to infertility. I can’t find anything on this as well. In order for them to be able to directly link Infertility with this vaccine wouldn’t they basically have to test your egg count and then get the vaccine and then test it again there after to be able to directly link? I’m not saying you’re wrong, I’m just not finding any studies nor reports from anyone on this.” </p>
<p>“Also, more on the afib case. A few things there I believe afib can often be treated with surgery as was the case of navy seal David Goggins had afib basically his whole life ran marathons and didn’t know until one day he almost had a heart attack, underwent a surgery and he’s fine now. So are you 100 percent sure and certain that this persons afib was related to the vaccine? Are there other things to consider like age, weight, diet, exercise etc? Or we know for certain that it’s this vaccine? Just trying to educate myself here as you’re someone in the medical field.” </p>
<p>Her response was: “I’ve spent years researching vaccines since I was vax injured. I don’t have the time or energy to justify my beliefs nor do I have any interest in attempting to change your beliefs, the information is just as accessible to you as it is to me. </p>
<p>Does anyone not see the issue with making claims and not being able to back them up. </p>
<p>Telling me to google stuff when I DID and found nothing??</p></p>

        <p>Let me ask you this. Are there any studies evaluating the impact on reproductive health from these vaccines? Considering the number of women who are having issues with their mensural cycles doesn't it make sense to have such a study? If not. Why not?</p>

        <p>I bet most doctors don't even see this as a problem. </p>
<p>A serious systemic upset like this is going to mess up a woman's cycle.  So a messed up month and 1-2 to get back on track doesn't sound crazy.</p>
<p>But more than that means something is messed up.</p>
<p>I would like to have some womens perspective on this.</p>

        <p>Right they need to test for this. I’m
sure there’s going to be a lot of issues that come from this they didn’t see I the trials. What we need to do tho is make sure we know these things to be true before anyone with influence says them.</p>

        <p>Her claims square with other reports.  Google is not our friend!  If you relearn how to perform websearches you'll soon come across studies that conflict with the narratives you've been reading.  Databases may not be as transparent as decades ago and Boolean operators can be hit and miss but if you want to search in journals you'll have to see why you aren't getting proper detailed results.</p>

        <p>You can look at my post history if you like, I am in the process of diagnosing my infertility right now. It's taken over a year and a half for me to get to this point after asking for help and my doctors still don't know what is wrong with me. It's not a simple process at all. Testing for infertility is like fumbling around for the light switch in the dark, only you're on the opposite corner of the room, no where near the light switch. So it won't be cut and paste to find out if the shot is causing infertility until we see actual evidence in birth rates dropping dramatically around the world and that won't be until at least a year from now, but likely longer. And that's only if they can prove without a doubt that it's the shot causing it, which is very unlikely when it comes to infertility where the woo-woo advice even from the professionals reigns supreme, trust me. </p>
<p>When the people in their early 20s getting their shot now go on and try to have kids in a few years and can't, and then start the long process of diagnosing infertility after a full year of trying (again, this takes <em>years</em> to narrow down the cause of infertility once it's confirmed to be a problem) and the doctors start noticing patterns in the people who are vaccinated vs unvaccinated and do proper long term studies, that is when you will get definitive proof. Until then, all we have to go on is anecdotes like the nurse gave you unfortunately.</p>
