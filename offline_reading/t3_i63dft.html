    <strong>Why do my children live in a world where their lives don’t matter as much as the 86 year old who was dying anyway?</strong>
    <p><p>My twins will be born in March. I don’t know what the world will look like then. </p>
<p>It is infuriating that we have these orders to “protect us” when it’s putting people out of work and harming the children of the unemployed. My husband and I are both working but it’s possible he could be laid off soon. I’ll keep working until I give birth and I can work at home after that. We won’t have much money and things will be hard. I’m so sick of people saying “well if we had a competent government we wouldn’t be in this mess.” Shut the fuck up, we don’t and stop saying “what if” because it makes you look like a pretentious asshole. </p>
<p>I see people wanting this lockdown bullshit to stay for a long time. Imagine how privileged you sound saying that. I’m very lucky to have a very good job. I’m saving as much as I can but I’ll be out of work after my kids are born. I’m so sick of everyone saying “we’ll just get another covid stimulus check” because I don’t want more stimulus money, I want everything to go back to normal.</p>
<p>I’m worried things will be getting worse. I’m worried riots and civil unrest will break out. I think it’s going to happen. I’m a bit of a prepper, I don’t have a bunker in my backyard but I have lots of food stored in my basement, plenty of guns and ammo, and one of my vehicles is always ready to go if I need to leave. I’m worried that it will spread to suburbs and I’ll be at risk of the violence. I don’t want my children to grow up in that world. Hell, I’m only 25 and my husband is 20. WE still have our whole lives ahead of us. It’s all fucking bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>And most of those were fake death numbers-  People who died WITH Covid, not OF Covid.  There is a difference.  Not to mention that forensic specialists are coming forward saying that no one they autopsied died of covid-19.</p>
<p>And that most of the deaths were people so elderly that they were already dying anyway.</p>
<p>AND let's not forget the hospitals who are faking all of the positive test results.</p>

<p>You will note that the latter is estimated at more than 100000 American deaths and the former is estimated at about 100000 American deaths, which, again, adjusted for population growth, is more than covid so far.  No lockdowns, no mask mandates, no nothing, no empathy from current grandmas who were young adults back then and didn't care about saving lives.</p>

<p>I don’t expect miss 86 to be the leading expert in how to stop influenza type viruses from spreading. I can forgive her for not knowing. Heck the CDC itself only recently just recommended everyone wear a mask. So I myself can understand that we weren’t too smart back then, but are now. </p>
<p>That’s like tearing down a Columbus statue now because he was bad(but par for the course) back then.</p>

<p>I mean, it's not, it's just describing how many people died as a percentage of the population (i.e. how deadly the virus is), but if you like feel free to look at the raw death count instead.  People were describing 100000 covid deaths as a "haunting milestone" and talking about it like it was some kind of calamity.  Meanwhile in the 50s and 60s it was barely a blip on most peoples' radar and the government did essentially nothing, and that's when it was a much larger percentage of the total population.  </p>
<p>But as to your other point there <em>were</em> mask mandates all the way back during the flu pandemic of 1918, so people absolutely did understand that masks can mitigate the spread of flu viruses even half a century ago.  People in the 50s and 60s just didn't have any empathy for the 100K dead, apparently.</p>

        <p>I really, really feel this.  My 60+ family members have decided that they "don't care if they die because the world isn't going to get better in their lifetimes." But, they simultaneously prevent their younger family members from preparing to survive that future by hoarding <em>all</em> the resources and refusing to do anything but take.  They are so used to living comfortably that they can't fathom having less of anything, even if for the sake of future generations having a bit more.  I'll never understand that level of greed.</p>

        <p>I have a new baby daughter. There are no good answers here. It’s because people are selfish and value their lives more than that of future generations. The boomers have been in power for 40 years now and they have left us with a shell of a country. Generation that grew up with no world wars, no major pandemics, and the greatest increase in wealth the world has ever seen. They took it all for themselves and they will keep taking until they die. They are the most selfish generation to ever live, and that is how they will be remembered. We, the younger generations, need to remember that life is more than how much $ you have in your bank account, and happiness can be found in other ways, even when your financial future is highly uncertain. Cause ya I don’t think many people in our age group are ever going to be able to retire. That was a privilege they took from us.</p>

I won't deny that there are boomers who support and benefit from what's been happening, but to act like only boomers are doing this, and pitying the millennial and Gen-X generations as if they had no hand in this is just completely ignorant.</p>

<p>This is so untrue. Especially on Reddit where the demographic is much younger. Hell, most of social media skews towards a young demo, and we've seen many accounts on this very sub of young adults encouraging and supporting lockdowns and the "New Normal". Also, I've known and seen many, <strong>many</strong> pro-lockdown supporters who are much younger than boomers, in the 20-50 age range. Many of these people are frightened, so much that they don't care about their lives being ruined.</p>

<p>Clearly, you are biased, and allowing your hatred of boomers cloud your judgment, and you're denying just how much the "young people" have fucked up their own lives, and those of everyone around them. You even use "some" as if you're implying they're a minority. </p>
<p>There's even a video posted here recently of a group of, surprise surprise, 20-50 somethings attacking an unmasked woman that is clearly 60 or 70 ("boomer age"). This is not just a bunch of "evil boomers" ganging up on the "poor, innocent younglings".</p>

        <p>The part where you act like people younger than boomers had no part to play in this mess. I also find it quite laughable you act like politicians were the only ones to blame for the lockdown. Honey, the citizenry accepted the lockdowns with open arms, and many of them are still clamoring for more. Politicians have no power unless the populace follows their direction. The average citizen, particularly people in the 20-50 age range, have a lot of "blood" on their hands for what's going on here. Stop denying it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think that some people forget that politicians are very cunning. They're definitely checking social media to see the response to their policies, especially with elections coming up. If people on social media weren't clamoring for lockdowns, would some of these politicians have went that way? The UK was originally supposed to go the Sweden route until young millennials on social media bitched and moaned about how Boris was willing to kill people and soon enough, he caved to the pressure and locked down. How many times have governors in the US said that they weren't gonna lockdown again, only to go back on their word? How many said that they wanted to reopen schools only to flip flop on that, too? The Boomers are on the way out. For a politician to be successful, they know they have to start reaching the young people.</p>

But people (yes, <strong>young people</strong>) are lapping up everything the politicians and "experts" are telling them, without doing their own research or asking questions.

        <p>&rt;They took it all for themselves and they will keep taking until they die. They are the most selfish generation to ever live, and that is how they will be remembered</p>
<p>I definitely feel this. My dad, born in 1953, is pretty much in his last year or two of life with his health conditions right now, and he refuses to get off his ass and complete inheritance and trust paperwork to this day for my brother and I. He has even said he doesn't care about anything and just wants to be left alone and die. And he's been a drunk, abusive a-hole all his life beforehand.</p>
<p>I have cried for his parents, my grandparents, when they passed but I'm not crying at his funeral, and I don't have it in me to write a eulogy or even say a few words at the funeral. I literally feel nothing towards him because the one thing he could do to make up for messing with my brother's and mine lives he's digging his heels in.</p>
<p>It's always been my opinion that not only did the immigration, economy and religion get messed up under the votes of boomers, but also that they were the most abusive and morally-questionable generation and their abuse led to the worst aspects of Gen X and millenials today (aka the helicopter-parenting and "participation trophy" cultures as well as lack of discipline)</p>

        <p>I think low fertility rates are partly to blame for this.  Not enough people are having kids and those that are do it much later, and therefore families dont have as much representation in the electorate as they used to. Back in the 80s there was a huge pro-family vote and every politician had to appeal to it to get elected.  That seems greatly diminished these days.</p>

        <p>well  in regards to prepping.</p>
<p>u might want to research a bunch more in regards to birth and pregnancy, well i guess u already are doing that, but u might be interested in some research i looked at myself.</p>
<p>first off during pregnancy we got ultrasounds, which are shown to be harmful to the babies:</p>
<p>random study showing harmful effect of it on animals:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18342141/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18342141/</a> </p>
<p>longer article with a lot more info and background:</p>
<p><a href="http://whale.to/a/ultrasound1.html">http://whale.to/a/ultrasound1.html</a> </p>
<p>during pregnancy it would also be senseful to look at vitamin d, b12 and iodine levels.</p>
<p>vitamin d and b12 are easy to supplement and to correct, but iodine can be complex, even complexer during pregnancy, if u would be having an iodine deficiency.</p>
<p>either way, feel free to read those articles on the topics and please don't shoot me for them not having peer reviewed references, as they are writing for very causal audiences, they do show the right tests and right amounts though, that also apply to pregnant women:</p>
<p><a href="http://health101.org/art_cancer_vitamin_D.htm">http://health101.org/art_cancer_vitamin_D.htm</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://health101.org/art_B12_Bottom_Line.htm">http://health101.org/art_B12_Bottom_Line.htm</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://health101.org/art_iodine.htm">http://health101.org/art_iodine.htm</a> </p>
<p>now in regards to birth, i would HIGHLY suggest, that u look at this presentation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yjdpqQ4tgs&amp;list=PLgH2vCx5TOgWuQtnPkwtwgrn5D-2pjhgc&amp;index=4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yjdpqQ4tgs&amp;list=PLgH2vCx5TOgWuQtnPkwtwgrn5D-2pjhgc&amp;index=4</a> </p>
<p>this presentation will be almost fully referenced with PMID numbers in it, so u can find the studies to look at yourself.</p>
<p>the rest of the playlist will mostly focus on infant vaccination and how it harms the baby's development and what not, while part 3 with hilary butler focuses on birth, breastmilk etc...</p>
<p>again most of it is referenced with peer reviewed research, so it is not just her opinion in a random youtube video. (a lot of people don't get that difference)</p>
<p>particularly to point out here, is the importance of delayed cord clamping, the avoidance of immediate hep-b vaccination and the avoidance of the vitamin k injection. both the vaccine and vitamin k injection contain neurotoxic aluminium.</p>
<p>example study showing the importance of delaying the cord clamping:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778270/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778270/</a> </p>
<p>&rt; The results suggest that delaying the UC clamping for 60 s reduces the risk for iron deficiency. </p>
<p>and this was just for waiting 60 seconds, i would suggest to wait 1 hour at least, before the cord gets clamped.</p>
<p>and the video will go over the importance of breastfeeding if at all possible and the issues with formula feeding.</p>
<p>a lot of this u might already be aware of, BUT sharing it certainly can't hurt.</p>
<p>in regards to the birth itself avoidance of pitocin (synthetic oxytocin) :</p>
<p><a href="http://whale.to/c/pitocin776.html">http://whale.to/c/pitocin776.html</a> </p>
<p>it can cause many issues for the mother and the babies and it should at best only be used in extreme emergencies, yet it is thrown around like candy resulting in many many many issues for mother and babies.</p>
<p>and after your beautiful babies are born, there are also further harmful standard practices beyond just injecting neurotoxins in the form of vaccines.</p>
<p>swaddling for example, that  can actually traumatize the babies as in the position, where they can't move at all even dissociate and thus get silent. they can also get hip problems from this practice.</p>
<p><a href="http://birthofanewearthblog.com/please-dont-swaddle-your-baby/">http://birthofanewearthblog.com/please-dont-swaddle-your-baby/</a> </p>
<p>if u don't like  a website called "birth of a new earth blog", then u can look at the 23 references of the article a lot of which peer reviewed studies or papers.</p>
<p>and if u get boys or one boy something extremely important:</p>
<p>DON'T  MUTILATE THEIR GENITALS. or how a doctor and nurse would call it: "should we circumcise them?"</p>
<p>while i could go into great detail on why this is a horrible practice, this should probably be enough:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/boyhood-studies/4/1/bhs040106.xml">https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/boyhood-studies/4/1/bhs040106.xml</a> </p>
<p>showing an estimated 117 neonatal deaths caused by circumcision in the usa alone per year!</p>
<p>i guess, that would be most of the important stuff, that i found when researching birth and child health.</p>
<p>i would also suggest to u, to look at home birth or birthing centers as places, where u get your babies, instead of  a hospital. given the fakedemic madness having a homebirth like a nice waterbirth with an experienced  midwife might even make more sense than it already does.</p>
<p>and to actually be in control of YOUR birth, it needs to be out of a hospital, because often doctors and nurses will straight up ignore what the parents decide, but let's not go into detail about that.</p>
<p>that is just a suggestion to look into. friends of mine had a beautiful waterbirth in a birthing center  :)</p>
<p>now please remember, that i put in all the effort to write this long comment with all the references, because I CARE! so please take the effort when u find time to go over them.</p>
<p>i care for u and your children, that is why i wrote this comment. i don't have an agenda, except the well being for u all, so again please read them and watch them.</p>

<p>don't put words into my mouth.</p>
<p>and my statement is actually based on the experience of many parents, that had their clear guidelines for their birth ignored during it.</p>
<p>for example hilary butler the researcher at her first  child's birth in hospital, despite extremely clear guidelines coming from her, had them ignored by the incompetent doctor, who clamped the umbilical cord out of the sight of the mother.</p>
<p>stuff like this is common practice. either parents' clear guidelines straight up get ignored or everything will get done to pressure them into changing their mind, often while the mother is drugged up during birth and the other parent is stressed out massively.</p>
<p>&rt;if you, the parents want to be in control of your birth, then it needs to be out of hospital.</p>
<p>that was what i said, DON'T put words into my mouth like this. i am sharing research here and information based on the experiences of countless mothers.</p>

<p>I’m not putting words in your mouth. Take a deep breath. I am simply saying that I don’t personally consider it polite to start ranting at a stranger on the Internet about what they should/shouldn’t do with their baby, especially when no one asked. How do you know OP can’t and won’t conduct this research on their own? I would assume they are both adults and will do their best. </p>

<p>my comment didn't get edited, u are trying to ignore the rest of the sentence to create a false idea.</p>
<p>i showed research to the person, who created this post.</p>
<p>there is nothing wrong with sharing research and the comment is deliberately created, so that the soon to be mother can make up their own mind based on the research.</p>
<p>u are also assuming, that a lot of this research is easy to find and a quick look up and hey doctors will probs know this already, so u just have to ask them, right?</p>
<p>that is not the case. most doctors won't be aware of any of this research and will practice 100% against the up to date peer reviewed research and against the health of the baby, that is the reality of the matter.</p>
<p>so the question needs to be asked:</p>
<p>why do u have a problem with me sharing research, so that the mother can make up their own mind?</p>

        <p>in reality most doctors won't read the latest studies.</p>
<p>at best they will  take a short look at some abstracts of studies, that they heard about and maybe the conclusion.</p>
<p>if most doctors actually read the peer reviewed research, then we wouldn't have the insane harm done in common hospital birth practices.</p>
<p>in your fantasy world, of fully up to date doctors, there would be 0! immediate cord clamping, while in practice we are looking close to 100%.</p>
<p>doctors might also get punished for actually acting based on the research, rather than false common practice, this is VERY common and is probably most known in regards to vaccines and cancer.</p>
<p>hell  doctors and researchers even use a made up verb of a doctor, where they did whatever possible to destroy his career.</p>
<p>so u will hear statements like: "i know, that  the hepatitis-b vaccine at birth is harmful and makes 0 sense, but i can't speak up, or i would get wakefielded."</p>
<p>"wakefielded" based on dr. andrew wakefield, a doctor who did what he was able to do for a set of children, but still the industry attacked him as much as possible to set an example. an example, that is so well known among other doctors and researchers, that he is even used as a verb. story about the case:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb_logo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb_logo</a> </p>
<p>so no u have no idea how things are going in the real world it seems.</p>
<p>and i didn't even bring up the financial interests of increased profits, if the birth happens much faster, than it would naturally happen, health of the baby and mother be damned, so pitocin in and off we go.</p>
<p>but have fun in your  unicorn world, where doctors are always perfectly up to date on all research and alternative ideas based on current research are appreciated and incorporated with open arms :D</p>

<p>So are you a tech geek (like me), or are you in the medical field? </p>
<p>You seem to hold a lot of confidence in your ability to “research” a subject by watching YouTube videos or reading blogs. I’m curious, how do you know that medical practitioners don’t read studies? Are you psychic? Peering over their shoulders? Or are you suggesting that their tests for licensing are inadequate? </p>
<p>You are barely scratching the surface of the medical field and spouting unfounded assumptions.</p>

        <p>how do i know this?</p>
<p>personal experience, tons of statements of other doctors.</p>
<p>continual existence of deadly practices, that  have been shown in studies to harm babies. this includes for example male genital mutilation or instant cutting of the umbilical cord, or vaccines.</p>
<p>if doctors would have kept up with the research, then no male genital mutilation would happen anymore on babies by doctors and the umbilical cord would stay connected until it changed to fully white at bare minimum!</p>
<p>those are just 2 extremely clear examples, where doctors and nurses don't read the literately.</p>
<p>delayed cord clamping research:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29097178/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29097178/</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778270/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5778270/</a> </p>
<p>and for male genital mutilation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/boyhood-studies/4/1/bhs040106.xml">https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/boyhood-studies/4/1/bhs040106.xml</a> </p>
<p>an estimated 117 deaths per year in the usa alone due to this horrible practice.</p>
<p>and that is just deaths and does not include all the other issues.</p>
<p>the basic reality of horrible practices still going on, despite clear research, that shows their harm, shows, that doctors don't keep up with the research.</p>
<p>and as stated doctors saying the same and from my personal experience this applies too with doctors.</p>
<p>also it doesn't matter what i think. i don't want people to believe me or wonder what i am thinking.</p>
<p>i am providing the research, so that people can look at the research and make up their own mind, because  very often the doctors and nurses won't.</p>

        <p>It’s called scientific dogma, and it’s an unfortunate phenomenon in multiple fields. That’s not a guarantee that doctors don’t “keep up with their research,” it means that many doctors are peer pressured to uphold a particular narrative, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Another name for this in the psychology field is called groupthink.</p>

        <p>groupthink is certainly also a huge issue.</p>

        <p>might very well be the reason. it would certainly be nice, if proper longterm RCTs would be done, to say for certain how many side effects and even deaths are coming from those vaccines, but surprise surprise the governments, pharma, government agencies and universities are refusing to do such studies.</p>
<p>i mean we know at least for DTP, that it increases overall mortality rates in 3rd world countries, but hell unicef and the WHO are straight up ignoring that data:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360569/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360569/</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Among 3–5-month-old children, having received DTP (± OPV) was associated with a mortality hazard ratio (HR) of 5.00 (95% CI 1.53–16.3) compared with not-yet-DTP-vaccinated children.</p>

<p>In this new normal, should we replace quarantines with larger penitentiary facilities or modern concentration camps? What you think?</p>
