    <strong>What’s wrong with the residents of this sub?</strong>
    <p><p>The other day I made a post about the survival rate of the virus and the success rate of the vaccine. I was simply curious and wanted to understand a perspective. I was happy when someone came into the comments and pointed a few things out so I proceeded to ask him for a source of his information to maybe better understand his point. But that is the point when he refused to show me anything and now I’m confused. </p>
<p>I’m willing to understand the people of this sub and understand their perspectives on this topic but if you can’t even show where you got your information from then no one is simply going to believe you!</p></p>

        <p>Not everyone carries arounds sources, and I'm not sure why people expect anyone to. Also one person doesn't represent the entire sub, I'm sure there would be a few people who would be willing to help you understand the statics. I will admit that some members here don't seem to want to inform people, but want to argue with people. I personally believe that we should try to educate people with the facts, because that's the only way to convince people that we aren't tinfoil hat wearing covidiots. Unfortunately some people don't want to listen to facts either, so sometimes people don't want to provide sources or go back and forth because the person isn't willing to learn, or is just wanting to troll.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I used to have a dozen tabs with papers and reports for various aspects of the science, the biology, the stats, the government comments on "we count anyone who ever tested positive as a covid death" and the uselessness of PCR, but a) it's a TON of work, and b) it never matters.  If someone really wants to argue, all the papers in the world don't convince them, and if they're really curious, just referencing "the danish mask study" or the "critical assessment of the corman-drosten protocol paper" is enough for them to find it if they want to.</p>

        <p>I most definitely understand your point. When I first found this sub, I thought it would be a great way to learn what the other end of the spectrum has to say. Now all I’m seeing is a bunch of people arguing a point but never telling me how they know that point is real. If you show me proof of your point then I’ll understand and agree with you. But I won’t agree with you until I see any truth.</p>

        <p>See that’s the problem I have. You people say all the information is readily available but every time I go to research these topics I am never able to find something. Also I’m in my 3rd year of medical school majoring is dentistry so my methods of research are much more then just the first few google results.</p>

        <p>Ok. Are you actually searching for “masks ineffective,” or are you just scrolling through news articles.</p>
<p>I’m a healthcare professional myself. I know how to research, I spent my entire last degree doing it. It’s really not hard to find the information if you’re actually trying. The difference is whether you’re trying or whether you’re just trying to be argumentative. The fact you “can’t find” any of the information leads me to believe the latter.</p>

        <p>The problem with this attitude is rooted in how our brains work.  We all have vast networks of information and ideas behind our beliefs, whether they're 90% science or 90% "i heard on twitter."  Anything else we hear is colored by that framework and positions that don't fit are surprisingly easily dismissed.  So I can show you a paper that says PCR is useless for diagnosing/detecting disease, and if you don't want to believe it, you probably won't give it the attention is deserves.  We're ALL wired this way.  But it means if I want to convince you, I need to back you in to a corner that makes you question your underlying assumptions, or present such a mound of background information to rival (without confronting directly) your current beliefs.  This takes TIME and lots of reading.  I've been researching aspects of biology, epidemiology, data science models, physics, all within the context of my stats background, professional mask usage (N95 and SCBA as a fireman), and with the resources of an EMT and Bio PhD wife with her medical and nursing contacts for MONTHS.  It would take weeks or months to relay all that to you, and when I have done so in the past, most continue with "yeah well you're still selfish and ignorant and don't know what you're talking about!" so it ceases to be worth it.</p>
<p>And it turns this space in to an echo chamber where there is little real discourse within or without.  (I believe vaccines are amazing, I just don't want this one, but many here will get angry if you tell them even the polio vaccine was a blessing to humanity.)</p>
<p>Yes, this lack of discourse is harmful, but there are so many bad actors and trolls that it wears you down after a while.  Why write pages of well cited conclusions that you suspect will fall on deaf ears?</p>

        <p>I get that, and that's why I said we need to try to educate people. I'd try to teach you but I'm honestly not the best at teaching and I don't keep sources. :L Like I also said, I'm sure someone here would help you.</p>

        <p>One of the first (and I mean late 80s dial-up bulletin boards) internet memes was "rtfm" (read the fucking manual), the grandfather to "lurk moar". Basically telling newbs to put in the initial effort to participate in the community. We're not your fucking wikipedia. We're not your mom. We don't care if you're sincere. <em>You</em> cannot contribute to the community because of your lazy ignorance, yet you expect others to provide for you.</p>

        <p>Tbh, we probably thought you were trolling, or a shill. Unfortunately, it's not like we can pull out a stat and suddenly open your eyes. To overcome the average person's cognitive dissonance and convince them the news is all lies, government has been bought and sold big "corporations", and that big pharma is essentially evil and doesn't care about your health, all in one fell swoop is a large task. There are too many sources we would have to list all at once  We know what we sound like. That's why we tell you to do your own research, because it's the only way you'll be convinced.
Where can you get valid info? 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/allvaccinesarefake/?ref=share 
is a Facebook group that advocates for vaccination, and posts side effects for people to get informed. It's scary as hell, and this is just one, obscure Facebook group.
Others are sourcing and saving similar horror stories from social media to document deaths and side effects of the " vaccine" because MSM isn't. If you stop watching and believing the news and research, you'll find a different world than you thought. The "statistics" are lies. Look for yourself. That's why we don't bother responding to poorly researched, "but why?" questions. Feel free to ask specific, intelligent questions that show you've looked into it a bit and want to understand, we will answer. Try and overcome your belief that the government is on your side, and that the world hasn't always been run by a small group of people that have never cared at all about us, and look at things objectively.</p>

        <p>This isnt entirely true. If you look beyond all the memes and the stupid people, I believe there is a small percentage who have legitimate causes for concerns with COVID-19 and all the mandates that have been put into place to battle the pandemic.</p>
