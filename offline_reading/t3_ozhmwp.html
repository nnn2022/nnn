        <p>Interesting ... Most of those articles indicate timelines in the general span of weeks, maybe a month or 2 ... How long has this pandemic been ongoing for?</p>
<p>Also, let's highlight, the language hasn't changed, they are saying they are beyond capacity like the other times, are you implying since hospitals have been stretched to the limits of their resources before, that since it's happening now during a once in a hundred year event, the public shouldn't be made aware of it, that the public shouldn't know hospitals/health services need more funding to be able to help the public?</p>
<p>If you live in the USA, where emergency services aren't considered essential, hospitals are basically privatised, and people die regularly of easily preventable diseases due to medical costs, them sure whining hospitals are "overwhelmed" sounds silly, they are a luxury I suppose.</p>
<p>Seriously what do you want them to say, nothing, oh majority of hospitals are triaging patients in parking lots, and bringing in shipping containers to handle the massive influx of bodies, but don't make a scene.</p>
<p>Please tell me, good individual, what is the point of this?</p>
