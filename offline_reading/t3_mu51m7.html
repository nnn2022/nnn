    <strong>COVID is the only vaccine in history where people are still required to mask up</strong>
    <p><p>The flu vaccine began 1n the 1930's, and became available large-scale in the US in 1945. Prior to then, and even afterwards, <strong><em>no one was mandated to wear mask AFTER receiving the flu vaccine.</em></strong> This is a graph that shoes the vaccine efficacy for every year for the past 10 years (through 2019-2020 flu season). It has been less than 50% effective for the past 6-7 years, and less than 50% for 8 of the 11 years included in the graph. Yet no one was required to wear a mask and lock down. Today's Covid vaccines claim 94% (Moderna) to 95% effectiveness (Pfizer), but everyone must still wear a mask, even if they had the full vaccine and are past the ramp-up period.</p>

<p>What about, say, the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine?  In general, DTaP vaccines are 80% to 90%  effective (the DTaP vaccine is a 3 in 1 vaccine and the aP part is acellular pertussis). Source: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/faqs.html#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20DTaP%20vaccines%20are,effectiveness%20in%20each%20following%20year">FAQ about pertussis vaccine--CDC</a></p>
<p>Even in a year with lots more cases of whooping cough and a highly vaccinated population, there has not been a mask mandate in the past century, or at least since the introduction of the vaccine. Whooping cough is more lethal for babies under 6 months, but adults and older children can get a milder case and still be quite sick. Even in young vulnerable babies, pertussis has about a 1% mortality rate. In older children and adults, it causes a milder illness, with a lower death rate. Cases of whooping cough (Bordetella pertussis) have been slowly increasing since the 1990's, despite widespread vaccines. There are several theories behind this, including waning immunity over time, but the increasing case numbers are all we need to know at the moment. <strong><em>So where are the mask mandates against whooping cough?</em></strong></p>
<p>&rt;<em>JAMA. 2012;308(20):2126-2132. doi:10.1001/jama.2012.14939</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>ABSTRACT (Excerpt)</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>Pertussis remains a poorly controlled vaccine-preventable disease in the United States, despite a well-established childhood vaccination program and high coverage. Although infants have substantially higher rates of pertussis compared with other age groups, data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System reflect a recent increase in the number of reported pertussis cases among children aged 7 to 10 years. In 2010, this age group had the second highest incidence of pertussis in the United States.</em></p>
<p>Two doses of the Measles vaccine is about <strong>97 percent effective</strong> at preventing measles, and one dose is about <strong>93 percent effective.</strong> This is pretty darn close to the claimed effectiveness of the Covid vaccine. There have been measles outbreaks in recent years, probably in those who haven't been fully vaccinated. <strong>Yet vaccinated people and even the general population weren't being forced to wear a mask.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;We can reduce the risk of measles with the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live (M-M-R II, commonly called MMR) approved by the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/consumers-biologics/vaccines-children-guide-parents-and-caregivers">U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in people ages 12 months and older</a>. Just two doses of the vaccine is about 97 percent effective at preventing measles, and one dose is about 93 percent effective. Children ages 1 through 12 years may also get the Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live (ProQuad, commonly called MMRV). This FDA-approved vaccine also prevents chickenpox.</p>

<p>Pneumococcal pneumonia such as Pneumovax is another vaccine, usually recommended for seniors.  Overall, the vaccine is 60% to 70% effective in preventing invasive disease caused by serotypes in the vaccine.  In seniors, the efficacy is about 64%, or similar to the troublesome J&amp;J Covid vaccine. It's not perfect, just as we are reminded about the 94-95% effective Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, yet no one is forced to wear a mask to ward of pneumococcal pneumonia, and "protect Granny" <strong>From the CDC itself:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Researchers conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial (CAPiTA trial)  in the Netherlands among approximately 85,000 adults 65 years or older during 2008–2013. This trial evaluated the clinical benefit of PCV13 in the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia. The results of the CAPiTA trial demonstrated:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;45.6% efficacy of PCV13 against vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;45.0% efficacy against vaccine-type non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;75.0% efficacy of PCV13 against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Substantial evidence demonstrates routine infant PCV7 and PCV13 vaccination reduced carriage and transmission of vaccine serotypes. This resulted in lower IPD incidence among unvaccinated persons of all ages, including infants too young to receive the vaccine.</p>

<p>I could go on with this, but I believe that this is sufficient for now to demonstrate that this hype and all the mandates, lockdowns, restrictions and all that are imposed on the general public, including those who have had the vaccine, are tied to some other purpose besides protecting vulnerable people and "stopping the spread". I encourage everyone to prepare a thumbnail version of this information wit references to our own government's recommendations in the case of other illnesses that have vaccines to present to those doomers, mask-holes and martinets who insist that it's "for everyone's good, vaccines aren't 100% you know"... and watch their eyes roll around.</p></p>

        <p>My guess was preventative towards many other conditions. I got bronchitis from a boss with walking pneumonia years ago and the following year from a plane. We also all got a flu that crippled my family all through Christmas and caused a 911 call and temporary blindness from dehydration. My mother in law and neighbor both died this month and February of non covid pneumonia and a lung infection. I think the masks could have prevented much of the above.</p>

        <p>Wear your mask if you choose, but don't get in anyone else's business if they choose not to wear one, and for God's sake, it should NOT be mandatory.</p>
<p>If you think that a mask might be beneficial... then you do you, and I'll do me. </p>
<p>BTW, did you take a flu shot this year? FYI,  the influenza vaccine for the 2019-2020 season was 45% effective overall against 2019-2020 seasonal influenza A and B viruses.</p>
<p>Specifically, the flu vaccine was 50% effective against influenza B/Victoria viruses and 37% effective against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Fifty percent is a coin flip. Thirty-seven percent is less than a coin flip. You are more likely to get the flu or have a more severe case under those conditions than not.  In fact,  severe illness markers, including laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalization rates among children and adolescents and among adults ages 18-49, were higher than at that time in recent flu seasons, including the 2017-2018 season, during which influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated.  So basically, the 2019-20 flu shot wasn't much protection at all. Some years were even worse...</p>
<p><strong>Influenza season and Estimated vaccine effectiveness</strong> (Source: US Center for Disease Control)</p>
<p>2018–2019 <strong>29%</strong><br>
2017–2018 <strong>38%</strong><br>
2016–2017 <strong>40%</strong><br>
2015–2016 <strong>48%</strong><br>
2014–2015 <strong>19%</strong><br>
2013–2014 <strong>52%</strong><br>
2012–2013 <strong>49%</strong><br>
2011–2012 <strong>47%</strong><br>
2010–2011 <strong>60%</strong><br>
2009–2010 <strong>56%</strong> </p>
<p>By comparison, the Pfizer Covid vaccine is 95% effective after 2 rounds once the ramp-up period is complete. The measles vaccine is 93% effective after one dose, and 97% after both doses. Follow the science, and do the math. But, you do you and I'll do me.</p>

        <p>I have no issue whatsoever understanding that none of us have ever been compelled to wear a mask after receiving a vaccine, even a piss-poor flu vaccine. The efficacy rating of the flu vax is noted above. Pfizer has a reported 95% efficacy after 2 rounds and a proper ramp-up period.</p>
<p>19-60% effective flu vaccine=no mask. 95% effective COVID vaccine=mask still required. Why?</p>
<p>Measles is far, far more contagious than Covid, with an R0 if 12-18, the most contagious virus known in humans.. Pertussis (whooping cough) has an R0 of 15-17, just behind measles. We have effective vaccines for both of those. </p>
<p>R0 (R naught) is the basic reproduction number, or a measure of how many other people could become infected from someone who has the virus.  R0 of COVID-19 as initially estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) was between 1.4 and 2.4.   The review by Liu et al. compared 12 studies published from January 1 to February 7, 2020, have estimated R0 ranging from 1.5 to 6.68. They found a final mean and median value of 3.28 and 2.79, respectively, with an interquartile range of 1.16.   The Imperial College group has estimated R0 to be between 1.5 and 3.5, while the Italian model estimated R0 between 2.76 and 3.25.  R0 evaluated on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship was 2.28 in early February of 2020. This is nowhere near the R0 indices associated with pertussis, measles, polio (R0 \~ 5-7), chickenpox (R0=10-12), rabies (R0=2-4, and rabies is 100% lethal if not prophylactically vaccinated for after exposure); rubella (German measles... R0=5-7), smallpox (R0=3.5-7). </p>
<p>We now have vaccines for all of these illnesses (routine rabies for animals, which protects humans and post-exposure rabies for those who have potentially been exposed... and limited pre-exposure rabies vaccine for humans who are at high risk due to their work with animals that potentially have the disease. I took rabies vaccine and titer tests back when I was working heavily with stray and feral animals, and wildlife). We have never required masks post-vaccine for any of these illnesses, which are more contagious than Covid which has a mortality of around 2%. Even that's questionable, considering that a significant number of people died "WITH" Covid, and not FROM Covid. Yet, if a person has a positive test at death or on autopsy, it's frequently shown as a "contributing cause", even if it's NOT. Person has a widowmaker heart attack during a bike ride and has coronary artery disease? "Covid is a contributor", even if it's not. So the true death rate that's DIRECTLY attributable to Covid is questionable. George Floyd tested positive for Covid on his autopsy. He died under the knee of a cop, had a positive test... "Oh, Covid made it hard for him to breathe so it must be a Covid related death as well as a police-related death (not finding guilt or innocence for Chauvin, only putting events together). Grandpa had a heart attack... he was Covid positive. Must have been Covid related (never mind that Grandpa smoked like a chimney for 50-60 years and had blocked arteries. Yeah, the virus killed him).</p>
<p>Due to my current job, I was required to take the jabs or become unemployed without appeal to unemployment. However, I do NOT wear a mask now that I have had both rounds of Pfizer AND passed the ramp-up time. If a mask is unnecessary after a shot that gives protection as low as 19%, then why is it compulsory after a vaccine that affords 95% efficacy? Yes, I get it. "REEE! No VaCcInE iS pErFeCt". But some are much better than others. If YOU want to wear a mask, that's your choice. My choice is for no mask. And it should be just that-- a CHOICE, not a MANDATE, particularly for the fully-vaccinated population.</p>
<p>But, you do you, and I'll do me.</p>

        <p>I legit do not understand the stance of this sub and your response. I thought I was banned. I’m not trying be brutal. I read the about section and it doesn’t answer my question. I don’t know why it’s letting me even reply other than the appeal. </p>
<p>People keep replying to me on here and I don’t understand the point to my response. I have articulated experiences and keep getting attacked on these actual experiences and actual deaths discussed. </p>
<p>What is this sub? People against the world Covid has altered and regulations? </p>
<p>I was responding on this sub to deaths and illnesses that came about pre Covid and during covid and stating where masks may have helped or where a 1 year plus known virus research is showing not all is known as comparing with centuries of cancer research with still no cure. </p>
<p>I don’t even understand who would have time to moderate a sub that’s in healthcare or lab research presently and those seem to be the only people that could discuss my concerns. Not ban for a discussion that falls under someones power controlled topics and thought process.</p>
