<p>Also they will definitely pass it on to their pets:</p>
<p>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57666245</p>
<p>And that means that the fleas on those pets will get the Rona. Then those fleas will spread it to other pets, who will spread it to their owners. We need to urgently vaccinate all fleas and make sure pets are socially distancing from each other, and their owners. Fleas will need to keep 1.5 inches socially distant until they are vaccinated or can show a negative test result.</p>
<p>Currently there are not enough masks for fleas available as we donâ€™t want the flea medical workers to go without. When we have enough masks for the whole flea community they will be mandatory if you are away from your pet.</p></p>

        <p>I saw this coming last year. Everyone said their cat/dog was the only thing keeping them sane, and the MSM was like DOES YOUR DOG TRANSMIT COVID?   </p>
<p>I tried to wake up a diehard doomer friend over the phone while her dog was in the room with her and all I could think about was that she'd kill the dog if the government asked her to</p>
