    <strong>Anyone else struggling with loneliness?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm 18 years old and I haven't seen a single person my age in person since the beginning of the lockdown, and the loneliness has really started to make me suicidal. It's impossible to make friends in the new normal.</p></p>

        <p>You gotta get out there and meet people. Don’t let them win. There are tons of people like you. I go into town when the lockdowns are lifted, chat with people. Almost all people I talked to know this is a scam or at least know about the hypocrisy. </p>
<p>Find these people. They are looking for a community too. </p>
<p>Community is the only way forward for people like us. Start your own. Gotta get creative. It’s your life. Take responsibility. </p>
<p>God bless</p>

        <p>I am 22y and lonely as fuck since 16. No friends, nothing. I will give my advice:</p>
<p>Find the reasons why you are lonely, look for them in your soul then you try to fix what can be fixable. I think its important to leave your comfort zone, friends dont need to be exactly like you or have the same interests, if you feel good with the person, just enjoy it. </p>
<p>The new normal is to connect with people in the internet, people that you know or people that are completely strangers. </p>
<p>If you are lonely just because of the pandemic, it will end, my friend, sooner or later. Try to hold on.</p>

        <p>When you get older you'll learn to turn that into anger and actually make changes. My only advice to you is to find a partner. That's the best way to get out of that hole both mentally and physically</p>

        <p>Wow. Some interesting responses here.</p>
<p>As an extrovert, I was fortunate that I have a job that is essential and social (working in grocery retail that requires me to go to several different stores). My wife is suffering much more than I as a stay at home mom who has had to shut down much of her normal social life.</p>
<p>First of all, if you need help, get it. Talk to a councilor, a psychiatrist, a priest, whatever. Humans are social animals (usually) and isolation can certainly be damaging to the psyche. </p>
<p>Secondly, find friends. Seriously. This is going to take breaking out of your shell, dealing with rejection, and taking chances. Its okay. Go grocery shopping and strike up conversations. Call up old friends and ask to meet for coffee (at a shop of just for an outdoor picnick, or at one of your houses). Write letters to people with fun little effects. </p>
<p>Do you have any hobbies? Do those and find others that enjoy them as well. </p>
<p>The "new normal" is not what you are experiencing now. This is a societal seizure. It will pass. But you can use it to learn to harden your resolve, practice the skills of meeting new people, and come out a better person. </p>
<p>Best of luck, friend. You can do this.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately that's a normal response to this. Nothing is wrong with you, even just being around people at uni was something that had a huge positive mental impact when I was your age.</p>
<p>Once people wake up and start going back to normal, take a look at your life. If you're still unsatisfied, do some journaling and reflection to figure out what you think is missing. </p>
<p>Also, you will gain a lot more experience as you get older even month to month. It doesn't matter how perceptive you are right now, you will always look back and realize you did something wrong. Just accept that and do something right every day.</p>

        <p>I've been introverted even before this scamdemic. I actually had plans to change that last year since it ended on such a bad note for me personally. Little did I fucking know, ha.</p>
<p>With the way people are now, I've come close to just giving up. No point in trying to do stuff with friends or find dates when they're all terrified of breath and will scream at you for asking questions.</p>

        <p>My 17 year old daughter might not agree with everything I think about what's going on, but she's been happy to violate the cdc guidelines from the begining. Luckily we live in a state that has reopened schools, with masks unfortunately, but her and her friends hang out constantly. You have to find some like-minded friends and get out there. We need you.</p>

It doesn't exist unless you manifest it.<br>

You AS Inflated Consciousness, the Ego and You AS Sentienceness, the Soul.<br>
