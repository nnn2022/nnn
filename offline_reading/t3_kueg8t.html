    <strong>Update on siutation in various states outside of the problematic urban areas (NYC, LA, Bay Area, Chicago, Portland, Seattle, Detroit, Philadelphia, Twin Cities, Boston, Cleveland) and the overall way of thinking</strong>
    <p><p>FIgured I'd do what's become a periocic inquiry of sorts into the method fo thinking currently being adapted by comunnities in various US states outside of the problem areas.  The cities mentioned in the OP are presumed to be lost causes; they're gonna have agitators who for various reasons have desires for us to be in survival emergency mode for years on end.  Texas and Florida are also not part of the inqiury for now since they've thankfully made it perfectly clear they're not gonna stand for the asinine demands leaders of other states and countries have been putting on their people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When it comes to, for example, Pennsylvannia outside Philadelphia, California outside LA and the Bay Area, upstate NY, West MA and other regions away from Boston, Eastern and Southern Washington, Illinois outside Chicago, Ohio outside Cleveland and Columbus and the ither states in question, hoqw have they been?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Are minds changing about lockdowns and understanding the absurdity of it?  Is there more freedom and are restuarants, gyms, bars, retail, manufacting and other businesses finding ways to stay functional?  Is there a desire to not be stuck in suvival mode?</p></p>

        <p>Outside of Harrisburg, PA: 
According to the owner of Fenicis Restaurant in Hershey,  Govenor Wolf assured restaurant owners that he wasn't going to shutdown indoor dining over the holidays so they filled their freezers. Governor shut it down anyway so many restaurants stayed open. Health dept in York County was closing non-compliant restaurants. Mask wearing appears to be above 90%, except in local convenience stores with primarily working class or rural customers. I personally know 3 people who died from Covid complications (had diabetes, obesity &amp; recent surgery - died from respiratory &amp; organ failure) and several nurses who have taken the vaccine - said the 2nd dose is supposed to be stronger. No reports of side effects other than arm pain from the 1st dose. 95 yr old relative and her 71 yr old daughter got pneumonia, night sweats and lasting fatigue but survived. My cousins family all got the virus in Palmyra, symptoms ranged from none to mild in the young, mild to severe with blood clots in the older mother-in-law but they all survived. The virus is making the rounds. I'm a self-employed contractor. Most people ask that I wear a mask when working in close proximity but I get the sense that the average working or middle class person outside the high-risk category is taking this in stride. Most people are interested in lockdown skepticism if they ask my opinion because I'm educated beyond political arguments. Thanks for reading.</p>

        <p>I live in NJ. We had one of the countries longest stay at home orders, however,we never had a second shutdown like many other states. People are mostly over this, at least in my working class community. Retail is definitely back to almost full capacity, the majority of restaurants are open for dine in (except McDonalds or Chipotle), bowling alleys, museums, and movie theaters are all open. The biggest difference is that many schools are sadly remote unless you attend a private school.</p>

        <p>Tulsa, OK: notable urban/suburban divide with the city proper mad as hell that the burbs refuse to mandate masks - some even refuse to pass toothless “official recommendations” for them. Masks are more common than not inside stores, and mandated in city proper, but non compliance is high; 10-15% don’t wear them or leave their nose out. </p>
<p>Everything is fairly open throughout the region, except Tulsa proper school remain closed and the suburban schools are hybrid/all in person with random shutdowns when cases get high.</p>
<p>Capacity restrictions (50%??) in restaurants in city proper, none in the burbs. </p>
<p>No masks outside - In city or burbs. Zero masks in cars. People seem to be struggling to take it seriously - like they aren’t all red-pilled NNN people but they are just like “eh, is this really necessary? Okay whatever but I won’t cover my nose.” </p>
<p>No mean looks or angry admonitions to non-compliant people, from cashiers or other shoppers. Don’t know if that’s apathy or southern manners or what. </p>
<p>Predictably: people are in much better spirits than other places. People are still laughing and chatting with strangers. The economy seems to be doing okay.</p>

        <p>Just outside of Austin, TX. Some restaurants have indoor dining, most just do takeout. I'm not sure about bars but some of them appear to be open. Mask mandate all over, but you can get away with not wearing one in larger stores. Most people outside don't wear masks, but you'll see the occasional crazy masked up with no one around for hundreds of feet. Cars too.</p>
<p>The further you get from the central city, the more people seem indifferent about everything but the local Nextdoor page is full of the kind of people you'd expect to see. I feel like if the mandates and restrictions were to expire tomorrow, you'd see about 5% of the people holding onto them.</p>
<p>Not as good as Florida, but far better than what we've seen out of Quebec and UK. Ironically we're in the middle of a rare snow storm so there's a lot of people outside playing in the snow, no masks.</p>
