    <strong>Boyfriend getting vaccinated tomorrow</strong>
    <p><p>So I saw on my boyfriends phone that he has an appointment to get his first dose of the vaccine tomorrow. He knows I am strongly against it so he hid it from me. He himself was agreeing that it didn’t make sense to get one since it doesn’t protect you from getting covid and doesn’t protecting you from giving covid to anyone. He’s basically doing it because his kids and whole family are (my opinion). I am very concerned for him. He’s about to be 51 and I have read so many bad things about it. He basically thinks I only read all the bad news and that he doesn’t agree the government is doing any harm and he says that if it could help then he did the right thing and if it doesn’t help that he just wasted an hour of his life and he has wasted more time on much worse stuff. I know I shouldn’t try to convince someone of their own health decisions but I am genuinely concerned for him. If anyone could post any reputable articles about this that I could send to him, I would appreciate it. I have sent him some from other countries and some about the AstraZeneca vaccine but in his mind, because none of that was in the United States it’s somehow different and doesn’t apply. He has also refused to wear a mask at work and he works at a waste water company so I just can’t understand why he’s doing this.</p></p>

        <p>Look, the chances of having an allergic reaction to vaccine is extremely low. I didn’t think Astra Zeneca is used in the USA so you don’t have to worry about that. His body his choice too. As long as he isn’t forcing it onto you then there is nothing worry about.</p>

        <p>You’re right, it is his body. And he isn’t at all forcing it on me. But I love him. I have also read things from that prior Pfizer Vice President saying the vaccine can kill you from other viruses and such and I just don’t want anything bad to happen. I wish he would just go along with his original plan and consider getting it after it has been out for about a year.</p>

        <p>I went thru the same thing with a loved one, basically their family bullied them into it. I dont think anything would help, &amp; sending more info that he isnt interested in doesnt help, thats what I did and I think actually made it worse, because like your BF he was also somewhat ashamed of caving in but he felt he had to prove himself. </p>
<p>You and whoever else pushing him gives him nowhere to turn.  So what I wish I had done differently: tell him he doesnt have to prove himself to anyone, not you or anyone else. Tell him that you love him no matter what. These are the messeges he isnt hearing enough of from anyone right now. He knows your opinion, maybe if he changes his mind it will be towards what isnt putting so much pressure on him.</p>

        <p>His family isn’t really pushing it on him. I honestly think that this has just turned so “trendy” with people posting their vaccine cards to social media and such that he’s doing it for that reason and because his daughters are getting it so he wants to like fit in and make them proud he got it. Because I know that if they were against it, he would be too. But you’re right-I know it pisses him off when I send him things and he told me that there’s the people who try to shove it down your throat and persuade you to get it and he said I’m the opposite and “fear shaming” him into not getting it. Which I am strong in my views about it and he is the kind of person that does not like being told what to do. So I know I’m not helping in the situation. But it’s hard for me to be supportive of this and not be scared and somewhat angry. But that’s my problem I suppose. But yes,I will try to be supportive of his decisions moving forward. Because I know he supports mine just because he loves me. Thank you for that.</p>

        <p>I'm so scared too. Just try to rememeber he is also scared and doesnt know what the right thing to do is. Social pressure is such a strong thing. My person is proud of himself for resisiting everything else, it already must be so much harder for him than it is for me to resist. I think maybe he feels this is the best thing to 'give in' on  maybe? Just tell him how proud you are that he has the courage to resist the other things and hope he will be ok.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I thought that too at first. I do try to realize that I an definitely hard to talk to about this because my mind just cannot be changed about how I feel and I do try to convince him to believe the same things I do. And whenever he tries to tell me anything that might be good about it in his mind, it is complete nonsense in my mind and I always have something to fire back with. So I do understand why he hid it in a way. Just wish he wasn’t doing this.</p>

        <p>Respect is about being open and honest. Concealing feelings and actions in a relationship is disrespectful. Yeah, he is absolutely entitled to do whatever he wants to his body. That's not what I was talking about. It's not getting a shot that's disrespectful. It's the fact that he's hiding it. It would be the same as if he promised to quit smoking but his partner found out he was sneaking cigarettes at work.</p>
<p>I know you're just shilling but you wouldn't want your partner to hide things from you either. Or like an affair in a monogamous relationship - yeah you have the natural right to fuck whoever you want, but it's still wrong to hide it from your partner and do things they don't like on purpose. Just don't be in the relationship if you don't agree.</p>

        <p>I do wish he wouldn’t have hid it. That aspect, I did find disrespectful. I try to understand where he is coming from. I did try to talk him out of it and maybe he found that to be disrespectful on my end.</p>

        <p>He should tell her, or else break up with her, yes. She should also know and express if that’s a dealbreaker for her so he can make that decision. But comparing it to an affair is beyond ridiculous. She’s freaking her shit out on him about a medical decision so he isn’t disclosing the appt. Not the same as cheating on her with another person. </p>
<p>I’m not a shill and I think the vaccine is dangerous and unnecessary.</p>

        <p>I’m not freaking out on him lol. But I am definitely strong in my opinions about it and I am very vocal about it. But he definitely does not at all need my permission to make any medical decision that he thinks is right for him. I was only trying to get some information for him so he could think about his decision because I truly am concerned about this. But I understand why he hid it from me kind of. I think he thought I would be mad at him or something. Or he didn’t want to hear me try and talk him out of it. And I can’t say that I didn’t try. But in the end, it is his decision and I need to respect that.</p>

        <p>Yeah - this is all I was trying to say.</p>
<p>Sorry you’re going through this though. My parents got it and I wasn’t  surprised but I was saddened. </p>
<p>He may just not be the guy for you... these issues are just going to keep coming and you know now that he bows to familial pressure and/or that he’s actually scared of this thing. Hard to be with someone who feels that way.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it makes it extra difficult that this whole time him and his family have been getting together for parties and such and not wearing mask but now they’re all so desperate to get the vaccine and talking about how if something does happen and they could have gotten the vaccine and didn’t that they would have the guilt of it. But in the same sentence say that it doesn’t make sense. And I’ve just always been strong in my opinions about it so it’s been hard to be with someone who goes back and forth. But I can’t blame him for getting it if he thinks it will help. Just very scared for him. If anything, I could totally be more on board with him doing it if he were to wait at least a year. Especially considering all we have been doing and not wearing a mask and haven’t gotten it. Maybe we have just been lucky but I don’t know, I don’t really believe that deep down either.</p>

        <p>They haven’t been thoroughly tested that’s for damned sure. The younger you are, the more years you’ll have to live with side effects, too...</p>
<p>Keeping my fingers crossed that he doesn’t suffer at all from the vaccine. Many/most people appear to be fine afterwards.</p>
<p>Super weird that he eschews the mask but not the vaccine. They are all part of the same massive overreaction/public freak out!</p>
