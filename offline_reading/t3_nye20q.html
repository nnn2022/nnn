    <strong>They admit on camera that they will have to rewire their brains to know how to hate those who are outside-the-box. (23-second clip)</strong>
    <p><p>The CDC said in May that those who had been vaccinated (not those who had natural immunity) could stop wearing masks. <a href="http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RachelMaddowSaysWillHaveToRewireBrainToNotSeeMasklessAsSelfishThreateningCovidDenierWhoIsDefinitelyUnvaccinated-23s.mp4">Rachel Maddow said in response that she had seen the maskless as selfish, as a threat, as Covid deniers, and as unvaccinated. She then said would have to rewire her brain</a>.</p>
<p>It is about a month later, and employers have begun concluding that everyone who wanted a vaccine has gotten one, and they are thus are allowing those who show their vaccination card to go maskless, while forcing those who do not show their card to wear a mask.</p>
<p>Instead of the mask indicating who is OK, the mask will now indicate who is not OK. Either way, masks are still being used to indicate who is OK, and who is not OK.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jews+wearing+star+of+david&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X">Making people wear something to indicate who is OK and who is not OK is one of the things the Nazis did.</a></p>
<p>One may be confused if they watch what Maddow said right after that (not in this clip) because she in no way admitted she was wrong, but then seemingly contradicted herself by saying that we should view everyone with compassion. Her statement was actually consistent in context though because she made that statement on the first day of the new CDC mask policy, but many still had not yet been vaccinated, and many who had been vaccinated still hadn't reached the 3-week mark after their second dose, and thus still had to wear a mask <em>at that time</em>.</p>
<p>About a month later, now that everyone who wants a vaccine has had one, everyone now knows how she must see those of us who are outside-the-box, but more importantly, we know how her fans and those on her side (about half the country) see us. Of course, those of us who do not conform already knew that such hate flowed from her side, but now everyone can see it.</p>
<p>To be clear, Maddow is just another front man, and she may even be a true believer, but all front men ultimately work for the same masters, and to their masters, it was never about science, it was always about control.</p></p>

        <p>Fortunately the rewiring can be done remotely... once the brain has been thoroughly thawed, of course.</p>
