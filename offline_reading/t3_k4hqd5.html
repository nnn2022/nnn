    <strong>As a long-time conspiracy researcher...</strong>
    <p><p>... I now shudder when I think that what I've been researching on for years is actually true.</p>
<p>I mean, from time to time I just sit up and think, "holy shit, all that is actually true, because it's happening, and they aren't even trying to hide it anymore".</p>
<p>There must have been a glimmer of hope in my mind that all that was in fact fantasy, surely reality can't be that fucked up. But no, it is THAT fucked up. Probably way more fucked up.</p></p>

        <p>It sucks. I was redpilled immediately after 9/11 because the whole thing was bogus, but after trying and failing to show people "unofficial" information in the immediate aftermath, I realized that it was pointless and eventually just stopped reading conspiracy stuff for the most part. I still privately believed it, just thought that it was hopeless to seek deeper truths on a planet where people prefer comfortable lies to any amount of uncertainty or doubt. What's the point of trying to see behind the scenes if you can never share it with any other humans - especially not anyone you care about? And even being dimly aware of any of it tends to isolate you, lest you slip up and admit to not buying into some widespread belief system?</p>
<p>As you can imagine this year has been a big kick in the ass. I didn't want to get back into this stuff, I didn't want my 'kooky ideas' to come between me and other people, blah blah. But now we're at the point where the common man is literally begging to be mass-vaccinated and global reset-ed by real life Bond villains, and I can't put my head in the sand and pretend it's all not happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, it really sucks. I wish I could have been born some time right after WWII and lived up until right before 9/11. The boomers had a great run. But things just keep getting darker and more dystopian. It's hard to imagine any kind of good future stemming from all this, short of major bombshell leaks coming from the people and organizations who engineered all this.</p>
<p>But when has anything good like that ever happened? If the media doesn't acknowledge something, it's like it never happened. I've told numerous people about Event 201 and they just shrug it off as nothing - it doesn't even register in their consciousness. THEY REHEARSED THIS WHOLE CHARADE OUT IN THE OPEN JUST A FEW MONTHS BEFORE AND THAT'S A MEANINGLESS DATA POINT TO THE AVERAGE PERSON. "Huh, that's weird. Anyway, yeah, I'm excited that there's going to be a vaccine soon!"</p>

<p>You and me BOTH!<br>
I've told people, someone's response was that the Gov do trainings like that all the time...to plan what to do. No sign of conspiracy, it's merely "normal" for that to happen.  </p>

        <p>I feel for you so much. Although it does feel pointless and so damn frustrating trying to share with people, communities like this have given me more hope that people are at least partially awakening. Even my left-leaning 60 y/o parents don't want the vaccine. My dad admitted it's suspicious that two pharmaceutical companies came out with a vaccine at the same time, right after the US election.. as if it were already prepared! They're rushing their agenda, which is just making people more suspicious, and causing an accelerated awakening. Right now a lot of bots are being used as an attempt to create positive outlook on the vaccine, but I don't really think it's working. Aside from those who see what's going on, there are plenty of naturalists, rural libertarians, and skeptical minorities saying "fuck the vaccine".. I think there will be a dark time (winter?) of further lockdown measures heading toward dystopia. But, I'm mentally prepared for that, and remaining hopeful that enough people are not going to stand for this shit, and that there may be some light on the other side. Perhaps even a shift of consciousness? I like to think exploring these "kooky ideas" (the truth) will allow me to make the right decisions, at the exact time I need to. Stay hopeful, my friend!</p>

        <p>An "actually dangerous" virus emerging to take me out of this shit show wouldn't be the worst thing. It's the World Economic Forum's warnings of "cyber attacks on our power grids" that I'm more concerned with. Thought that might be the dark winter they're referring to. Also, if "they" release a really deadly virus, it wouldn't be that easy to protect themselves.</p>

        <p>I know I'm half starting to believe that Alex Jones interacted with interdimensional human beings on DMT at this point. Seriously, though, if this does turn out to be as bad as some of us fear, we've all got a job to do and that's clearly fighting it. I've honestly started to feel more at peace over the last month or so. We KNOW we're right about this and you have a part to play in fighting it (even if ultimately it's futile lol). It really does give you a sense of purpose that slogging away at a 9 to 5 in the good ole pre-reset days couldn't provide.</p>

        <p>I feel you. Now that they feel confident enough to put it all out in the open, it feels like they're showing vulnerabilities and it's giving us an opportunity to bring their whole system down. Their power comes from making us believe we can't do anything, but more people now than ever are being inspired to fight back.</p>

        <p>I read about the forced vaccinations years ago and thought surely this is fucking ridiculous and no one would allow such bullshit to occur but here we are. They will force you by taking away your livelihood and not being able to travel, work, live basically. Then I thought ok this happens in movies and everyone fights in the end. Well our sleepy population is welcoming all of this thanks to media and social media. I'm done. I'm in such shock rage isn't even a word to describe how I feel on a day to day basis.</p>

        <p>my perspective is that there is no conspiracy. </p>
<p>this is how power works they were always taking us in this direction because that's how most of human society has been setup. </p>
<p>from the village chief to the "civilized" societies of ancient empty and peru, people already try to centralize power. </p>
<p>"democracy" is a lie. they know at the end of the day we are controlled. they figured out how to put a nice bow on the packaging. </p>
<p>there will always be people like us, who don't believe in living controlled lives and want to break free. but there will always be more people like the promaskers who believe that they need to follow someone else's authority. </p>

        <p>All that conspiracy requires is a shared incentive to commit illegal or immoral acts. The ruling class has that incentive, and is committing those acts, so yes there is a conspiracy. The incentive structures that guide the behaviors of the working, middle, upper, and ruling social classes differ, and in the past the elites were held in check (somewhat) by pushback from the other classes. Nowadays the middle and working classes have been neutralized by a combination of drugging, media saturation, and selection pressures for docility. This allows the ruling class to press forward with their parasitic extractive and oppressive schemes without being limited by a balance of power. Their parasitism is now killing the host, but they do not have the wherewithal to hold themselves back. These forces are coming to a head now, and the next decade represents the greatest potential for change in a multitude of possible directions.</p>
<p>Regarding your other point, I have been going to protests weekly since March, and at least half of the "conspiracy theorists" I have talked to are just sheep looking for a different wolf. The amount of shilling for Trump or QAnon is revolting. (Both are controlled op - controlling the opposition demonstrates an intentional conspiracy rather than simply a convergence of incentives.) Even some of the leaders of the rallies (many of whom are feds) shill for Trump or other sockpuppet political leaders, but somehow most demonstrators miss this towering red flag.</p>

        <p>I think you missed the point. </p>
<p>My point was calling it a conspiracy is a misnomer. </p>
<p>They're not hiding what they're doing. It is very out in the open. I mean we have the words right out of their mouths. "New normal", the phrase "things will never go back to normal", "health passport", "vaccines will be required to travel". We have Agenda 21. Event 201. Lockstep document. </p>
<p>It really can't get more blatant. So I think we need to stop calling it conspiracy and call it reality. </p>
<p>Calling it conspiracy allows people to dismiss it as some kooky internet weirdo nonsense. While calling attention to what are <em>facts</em> helps people realize this isn't a made up "theory", it is the reality of the people and societies that control us. </p>
<p>There is no logical reason people you've never met control your entire existence and take money from you everyday. Yet we all participate in that system, most of us without question. </p>
<p>This is more opinion, but I think you overestimate historical pushback. The people rarely push back significantly enough to bring down the ruling class. </p>
<p>If they do, another ruling class simply swoops in and replaces it. </p>
<p>As it stands we haven't seen the true oppressive levels necessary for people to revolt. </p>
<p>This is unfortunately run of the mill government control practices.</p>

        <p>Thousands of years, really, but at one point the public was definitely able to push back more than they are now. The hippy/anti-war movement was one such example, which was discredited through the <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/tate.pdf">Charles Manson hoax</a> and destabilized through LSD-pushing. I don't believe that the public was always <em>this</em> ovine, though of course any pushback throughout history was infiltrated and misdirected at the wrong culprits.</p>

        <p>This is also a good thing and a bad thing. A lot of people are finally waking up to who actually runs the world and the direction they are taking it. They = "Sabbatean Frankists". If you dig deep enough. But the powers at be know this and are rushing in their centuries old plan too fast and are really sloppy with it. The pushback will soon gain momentum.

        <p>You should provide a source for your claim that Sabbatean Frankists are the progenitor group of the current elites. From all the research I have done, Zevi was <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/occult.pdf">just another agent</a> (you can ctrl-f Zevi, but the whole paper is worth reading) and the furthest back we can trace the current rulers was ancient <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/phoenper.pdf">Phoenicia</a>.
