        <p>Exactly. So many people just blindly trust whatever a doctor tells them, forgetting that they are simply human beings like them. Everyone makes mistakes, even doctors</p>
<p>They aren’t a godsend from above, they’re people who have a lot of money (or a lot of debt) and went to school for a decade. Has no correlation to their morals, common sense or intelligence. Someone working a fast-food job could have more common sense than a doctor, all depends on the individual. That’s why I say always get more than one opinion from different physicians, chances are you’ll hear something different each time</p>
<p>Not saying there aren’t good doctors out there, there’s a lot of extremely intelligent doctors for sure. But there are many bad doctors as well, and most people don’t seem to want to accept that or even want to believe it to be true</p>

        <p>I am a surgeon (so a doctor) and i agree with you. We do everything in our power wih the knowledge we have but i always felt like there's another force operating. When a patient's time is up it is..Heartbreaking everytime but it brings you back to the reality that we do not have as much power as some people think. We do not always have answers and/or cure and most people want a magic pill instead of working on their health.</p>
<p>The only thing i don't agree for me personally is that i worked extremely hard to get there,i wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I know that some do and that's good for them but even with money it isn't a walk in the park. It takes sacrifices.</p>
<p>Knowing that i could lose all that over a vaccine is terrifying but if i have too so be it.</p>

        <p>Oh yes,there's a big Omerta going on and anyone working at the hospital will say it (if they are honest of course). We cannot speak. Federations are checking on some of their employees facebook and such to make sure they don't do "misinformation". </p>
<p>Same with employees in elderly residences,why the hell this vitamin D story is the same in many continent...</p>
<p>People are scared to speak but we have trusted sources where we can send crucial and confidential documents. Many of us are whistle blowers. </p>
<p>Doctors and higher grades nurses get a bonus ($$$) to diagnose and write down covid on death certificate. That's how many of them had their silence bought and if they speak they'll automatically be compromised. It is in their best interest to shut up.</p>
<p>I know that at some point they'll tell us that we are putting patients in danger and that we have to take it. I won't as well as many others. Mainstream medias are trying to destroy us for this.But we are prepared to fight because we have the law on our side.</p>
<p>I strongly advice to every health worker that suffers from bullying at work to keep a recording machine (not a phone as it is obvious),as long as you are part of the conversation it is legal.</p>

        <p>Like with any field if there's new technology not everyone understands it, but I'd trust a car mechanic with older technology. Do I trust all mechanic/manufacturers/designers to know about self driving car technology? No. Not at all. Not to denounce the regular doctor or car mechanic for they can be extremely knowledgeable, obviously more so than google-fu me, but anyone claiming they completely understand a new technology, without proper safety testing etc, is speaking bullshit.</p>

        <p>Big Tobacco basically created the roadmap to funding bias by circumventing peer reviewed studies declaring the detriments of cigarettes by funding their own studies and launching massive marketing campaigns. </p>

        <p>And the very pharma industries pushing these vaxx have been sued within the past 5 years, dozens of times collectively throughout history, but "Trust the Science"</p>
<p>If you google Pfizer Criminal History, it comes up with a special heading that they are "repeat habitual offenders"... <em>not that anyone is inhibited from researching what they are injecting in themselves anyway.</em></p>

        <p>I think the only cigarette I ever enjoyed was a Camel Turkish Royal, how fitting. It had a sort of sweet tobacco flavor, but I wouldn’t say it was particularly tasty enough to make me consider picking up the habit or anything. I’ve been told by older family members that cigarettes (and tobacco products in general) tasted different back then, but that could just be due to a change in perception rather than actuality.</p>

I think that's the only way.  I hope not.  I still have hope that I can quit.  It's my cake day ND I want to have many more. I know that by not quitting its going to get me in the end.</p>

        <p>Have you actually tried anything else or did you just give up right away? Try a vape. Try patches or gum. Try to go cold-turkey. Try to slowly cut down</p>
<p>Just because you can’t quit doesn’t mean a substance should be illegal. All substances should be made legal, because everyone has the right to choose what they want to put into their body</p>
<p>You chose to start smoking one day, therefore YOU have to deal with the choice you decided to make. The only person that can make you quit is you. You decide to go to the store to buy a pack, you decided to start smoking and you decide if and when you want to stop</p>
