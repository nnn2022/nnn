    <p><p>Riddle me that. According to doomer logic we all should be dead ten times over. Maybe because it’s a protest the virus doesn’t come out and play. We did see similar behavior at the BLM/antifa protests after all and those were BEFORE mass vaccination.</p></p>

        <p>They do not care about COVID cases/deaths in this situation. They had no problems reporting on large gatherings such as the Sturgis biker rally last year and various full-capacity events in Texas/Florida. </p>
<p>They called them "superspreaders" and bemoaned the inevitable piles of dead grannies that would be rotting in the streets outside of overflowing morgues. That doomsday scenario never actually happened, but that didn't stop the fearmongering.</p>
<p>They love to demonize conservative-associated events, but these protests are different. They do not wish to acknowledge their existence at all.</p>
<p>They are mostly not being reported because the media selects what will be shown, and they shape a narrative by doing so.</p>
<p>They want viewers to believe that there is a wide public consensus in favor of pandemic measures. </p>
<p>Now, they are lying by omission, but that does not bother them. They can claim objectivity because they are not making up fraudulent claims, but in this case they are lying nonetheless. </p>
<p>By not showing the extent of anti-pandemic measure sentiment, they are not telling the whole story, and leaving these protests out distorts the truth.</p>
<p>If they show hundreds of thousands of people in the streets angrily protesting lockdown measures (like we've seen in London,) their illusion cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>If they let on about the truth there, the public will begin to see that a rather large amount of people disagree with the pandemic response. </p>
<p>They can show small anti-pandemic measure protests, because that portrays dissent to be a fringe movement comprised of low-IQ far-right nutjobs.</p>
<p>This is why you will occasionally see the media run a story on a few people holding a protest, where they are then shown in the worst possible light to make viewers feel that the movement is based on irrational beliefs. </p>
<p>They will not show the absolutely massive ones (that include protestors from every part of society) that have been going on recently, as that would show the truth.</p>
<p>The public will start to acknowledge that you can have an opinion independent from the liberal media-dictated value system, and their stranglehold on the public mind will weaken.</p>
<p>This cannot be allowed, so they simply will not admit that a large-scale lockdown protest could even exist.</p>
<p>They want people that question the narrative to feel isolated. They want them to feel like a social pariah; they want them to believe that nobody agrees with them except the insane and/or evil.</p>
<p>They want to gaslight them into believing that nobody supports that type of thoughtcrime but them, and that they should feel morally inferior for maintaining such an "irrational" belief.</p>
<p>They did the opposite with BLM protests - they constantly portrayed them as much more popular, much larger in scope, much more peaceful, and less of a COVID risk than they actually were so that they could creative a narrative that supporting those events was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Once you begin to see the narrative being shaped, and study how the state media of authoritarian nations works to suppress dissent, you will see exactly what is going on right now. </p>
<p>It is no different than what was done in the USSR, Nazi Germany, Maoist China, or any other nation that had (or currently has) to maintain public support for tyrannical actions. </p>
<p>They are simply attempting to shape reality and only include the parts where their side is shown favorably.</p>

        <p>TLDR:</p>
<p>It’s not about cases. It’s about making us feel like 99% of the world disagrees with our desire for freedom. </p>
<p>I agree.</p>
