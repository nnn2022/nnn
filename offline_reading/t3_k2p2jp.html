    <strong>Reddit and sites like Reddit DO NOT represent real life.</strong>
    <p><p>I think it's important that everyone is occasionally reminded of that. Surrounding yourself with these retards can be alarming and make you think the world has gone mad. Most people aren't nerdy shut-ins who want the entire planet to be lonely and miserable like them.</p>
<p>Just remember that your average person may wear a mask and follow orders, but even they are getting tired of this shit and want to move on. My opinion is that they just need a good leader to make the first move -- most people are followers after all.</p></p>

        <p>I can’t even look at the Vancouver sub when they post updates for the province. There are so many comments begging for a complete shutdown, saying if I go to the gym I’m trash, even though my office was opened for the last several months until just recently they closed unless you wanted to go in. They panic over the case number without acknowledging the testing went up, and there’s no updates on rate of recovery or info on the people that died, such as age or health issues. They just want to shut the world down and if you disagree you’re evil</p>

        <p>Same thing with the Edmonton sub. But I have to say, if you're interested in the ages of people who died, comorbidities, etc. Alberta health has made all that information public for our province and it's very enlightening. 76% of deaths in AB had 3 OR MORE comorbidities. And the average age of death is 82, but it has a full breakdown of every death in each age group and numbers of comorbidities. Hardly anyone has died without at least one comorbidity, including the very old. (So some of the deaths with zero comorbidities could also have been 90 year olds) I think Alberta is one of the few provinces that actually keeps track of or at least makes this data public.</p>

        <p>That’s the thing, if they showed data that backed up the claims that family gatherings were leading the spread, I’d be able to stomach not seeing my family. But I’m single and live alone and sometimes it’s nice to see them, yet my siblings are terrified of getting it despite going for dinner to restaurants with their spouses and stuff. Whatever Bonnie Henry says, they believe</p>
<p>Also that’s awesome Alberta shows that data. That at least should quell some fears people have. I’ll admit at the beginning of this due to the uncertainty of what we were facing, I was reluctant to go out and live my life. But now that I keep seeing pro athletes get it and be asymptomatic or get minor symptoms, it tells me that if you’re relatively healthy you should be fine. Even Georges Laraque, a former NHL tough guy, got it and was hospitalized because he has asthma, but he said he just woke up and did a mini workout and eventually he was good to go. His advice was not to lay there and do. I thing because it makes things worse</p>

        <p>I was at a local mall yesterday. I never go on Black Friday but figured hey it shouldn’t be too crowded given “pandemic” and I’m in a very “woke” wealthy suburb. Was I wrong. Other than mask wearing it was any ordinary holiday season at the mall. Most people I know also had thanksgiving or traveled somewhere. </p>
<p>The media narrative used to be that everyone was hunkered down while only a fringe minority were out living their lives, but they can’t hide the fact anymore so many are done with it. Even doomer types I know are mostly back to normal, some have even made fun of the ridiculous decrees by our mayors/governors. It’s the vocal minority of freaks on Reddit and social media who make you think we are the crazy ones.</p>

        <p>I would agree with this, but why does political polling say the opposite? </p>
<p>I can only speak for my country, but UK polls often show massive public support for strict lockdowns. Like 3/4 or more. Even allowing for error, how do you reconcile this apparently massive weight of opinion?</p>

        <p>news polls are often a poor representation of things too though. Even though they have no bearing and there is no punishment for the answer, people are proved to often lie by saying the "approved" response. Not to mention these polls often ask people ambiguous questions that lack any detail or nuance</p>

        <p>the sub for the college I attended is horrible. Knowing I live in close proximity to people who think we could make everything better by 'shutting down for real' is startling. And of course if you don't take the vaccine you're basically a sociopath. But it's comforting when I remind myself those who are on Reddit don't represent the population as a whole.</p>
