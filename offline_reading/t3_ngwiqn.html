    <strong>Wanted to share a ridiculous thing my job expected us to do</strong>
    <p><p>When all of this bullshit started my job was quick to get on the good boi train and wanted us to do all of this extra shit that didn't help but one thing stood out to me. </p>
<p>A money tray. </p>
<p>We were supposed to have customers put their money on a tray which we would pick up, take the money, then put the change on the tray and slide it back to them. </p>
<p>It's seriously no different than just handing someone the money. If not worse because everyone was touching the same tray. </p>
<p>I went along with it for a couple of days so I didn't get backlash from my boss. Even sanitizing my hands between each customer.  And then this old lady came in saying "You know you should really be wearing gloves." </p>
<p>How would that be more effective than literally sanitizing my hands between each person? Am I expected to throw away my gloves every time I help a customer? </p>
<p>I told her simply "But the germs would just get on the gloves?" And then she just shook her hospital badge at me. I was expecting her to be a doctor or a nurse. But nope. She's a front desk worker. Wow you really got me there. I just shrugged and she left. </p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh afterwards.</p></p>

        <p>The tray thing is so god damn stupid. I saw it for months around here in Arizona. And also passing straws by placing them in another container for you to take. </p>
<p>I swear to God this was all designed to laugh and mock people with common sense to be tortured by their complaint little zombie population. I guarantee they are all laughing behind the scenes and jerk off to how many lives have been destroyed by their prank.</p>

        <p>The goal posts for virtue signaling keep moving. At first, you were a good little boy if you didn't buy masks because it meant healthcare workers would have them. Then from masks to the vaccine to gloves, now it's just a competition to see who can conform the best and give up the most freedoms.</p>

        <p>Because people are so stupid they can‚Äôt comprehend basic common sense. They don‚Äôt understand that gloves are not some magical article of clothing that zaps away bacteria. Gloves are only effective at lowering the spread of germs if you change them constantly, most people aren‚Äôt doing that</p>
<p>I see people at the grocery store with gloves on touching everything, touching their faces and masks. Like what the actual fuck is the difference? You‚Äôre better off washing your hands than wearing the same gloves for weeks on end. People are so dumb, it hurts my soul</p>

        <p>l did some physiotherapy sessions for my knee and when l was getting out of the facility l was confused to see a young lady staring at the exit door. I went and opened the door and she said thanks for opening it so l didn't have to touch the handle üôÑ l was like okay. You're afraid to touch a handle but are okay if someone else does.</p>

        <p>Look, I wore disposable gloves anyways because I had to collect garbage and often clean sticky shit off of shelves. I got a lot of cuts and bleeds as well. (Someone tossed chewing tobacco in a shelf once), so that doesn‚Äôt bother me. Of course wash your hands after disposing of gloves as well.</p>
<p>But when I see customers with gloves and face shields and that crap, those are the special kind of people.</p>
<p>Customer asked me once if she needed to bring a mask into the store, and despite it being enforced by the shore, I just shook my head and said ‚Äúno.‚Äù Because I couldn‚Äôt care less about it.</p>

        <p>What absolute insanity.... Honestly this whole pandemic has made me REALLY despise nurses and other hospital workers they are self righteous assholes who pretend to care for others but only care for themselves. Case and point something like 40-50% of them are refusing the vaccine while their god damn union is calling for masks to protect them. Well if you want to protect them then make these morons get the vaccine! Ugh I am so done with this stupidity</p>
