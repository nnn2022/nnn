    <strong>Me and millions of others have been immunocompromised and vulnerable for years, did anyone give a fuck? No.</strong>
    <p><p>I have an autoimmune condition which requires me to take immune-suppressing medication in order to function. I’ve had to do this for many years. This puts me at increased risk for infections, especially life-threatening infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis which kill millions per year. Millions of others take similar medications or have other conditions which also make them vulnerable populations in this regard. </p>
<p>Did any of these pro-mask pro-lockdown people ever once give a single fuck about people like me before this pandemic? Did they ever consider wearing a mask in public places, in the hospital, using hand sanitizer, etc before the media gave them a trend to hop on so they can feel good about themselves while displaying sick and disgusting hatred toward anyone who doesn’t conform? Of course they didn’t. </p>
<p>And I don’t blame them for that. I never expected anyone else to adapt their entire life around me. It was and always has been my responsibility to be as safe and careful as I can. I weighed the risk and benefits of doing the things I want and need to do and getting sick, and I made and continue to make those decisions every day because I’m a fucking adult. </p>
<p>I would never in a million years want people’s lives to be destroyed, their businesses wrecked, their mental health in shambles, their kids sheltered, etc to make me feel safe. Even if it means that doing the basic activities of living for me means multiple severe illnesses per year which can last months and make it hard to function. </p>
<p>Just pointing out what massive fucking hypocrites these people are. They will try and convince you that you’re the one who doesnt care. In reality they are the ones who don’t care. Not only do they not care about the average citizens who have been destroyed by lockdowns, they also don’t even care about the vulnerable and immunocompromised people who they pretend to champion. They never did. They have and always will only care about themselves and their own self-righteousness. I will never forgive them for this. </p>
<p>Fuck them. Fuck lockdowns. Fuck masks.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you! It’s incredibly frustrating seeing them pretend to care and pat themselves on the back when they ignored it their entire lives. And did they ever even ask the vulnerable and elderly if they wanted all of this? Do they really think grandmas would rather live their last years isolated and alone and then die in a hospital bed with no visitors rather than spend time with their families and take the risk of catching a cold?</p>

        <p>“Now that there’s a pandemic they seem to care and that frustrates me” what a strange argument. These same people who frustrate you are pro vaccine because they know herd immunity is what protects people like you. But we don’t have a vaccine in this case.</p>

        <p>That’s simply not true though. Even though we have some vaccines, immunocompromised people are still vulnerable to plenty of infections. Tuberculosis is a good example. A lot more people have died from TB than coronavirus. We could have decided as a society years ago that we need to lock the world down and mandate masks to stop the spread of tuberculosis. Of course we wouldn’t do that because it’s ridiculous. Just like it’s ridiculous to lock down the world and mandate masks for Covid.</p>

        <p>And that's the true reality of all these sanctimonious, virtue signaling doomer assclowns...it's ALL about them! They want you to believe it's because they're just SO concerned about human life and their fragile little hearts break with the knowledge of every death that happens. That is all complete bullshit, they're just scared for themselves because Covid has been made out to be the most dangerous virus ever &lt;cough&rt; 99.998% survival rate &lt;cough&rt; and they are literally at deaths door if they so much as step foot outside! And since the media has done such a phenomenal job with the fear mongering these people all feel they now have a legitimate need to be afraid, where that didn't happen in the past. And since now they're afraid, EVERYONE must comply so their precious lives don't come into any potential risk. They are 1000% completely only looking out for themselves, nobody else. And that's why, before Covid, you never heard a single peep from these people and they were perfectly fine with the decades that went by and all the deaths that happened from all other diseases. They could give two shits deep down about all those lives lost or deaths, but they can't say that because then they'd look like selfish assholes. So it hides in grandiose displays of lecturing everyone else so we can save humanity and protect all those lives they care SO deeply about. They can all get fucked.</p>

        <p>And the irony, we get labeled as the "selfish" ones. Meanwhile we are the ones actually looking at the collective and the big picture and not in total tunnel vision by our fears. We are the ones not wanting to destroy the world for the many, billions and billions of people, to protect the statistical few. How selfish of us.</p>

        <p>I’ve been immune suppressed since the age of ten. Seeing healthy people walk around like there sick is super fucked up. Never in my life did I imagine a group of adults behaving so stupidly. It’s like all critical thought has left them. Get this through you head, you are healthy. Unless you have a legitimate health concern you are not dying. Stop acting like you are ill. If you have to be told your sick you are obviously not. The only thing that’s evolved over the past ten years is humanities level of stupidity and laziness.</p>

        <p>People ask how could Nazi Germany happen... how could the Soviet Union happen... dude this is how. This is exactly how. We all have it within us to become the worst thing we imagine, to become that which we profess to hate; you aren’t automatically exempt by benefit of being “a good person.” </p>
<p>You avoid it by choosing, every single time, to not even start down the path to what those nations became (and they’re just the most egregious examples - both history and the present day are full of such examples).</p>
<p>If they don’t stop this course, the way will be set, the future written, the destruction inevitable; and they’ll only have themselves to blame.</p>

        <p>But.. there is no medical reason to not wear a mask.. studies have shown that even in senior adults, o2 levels do not drop when wearing one.</p>
<p>So, there’s that.</p>
<p>And, sorry if you’re immunocompromised, but I’m still going to wear a damn mask if it helps me NOT kill you with a damn cough.</p>
<p>Masks work, so does social distancing, in an effort to keep a hospital bed available for you, should you need one.</p>
<p>And people have always cared about you, you probably just don’t walk around with you “I’M IMMUNOCOMPRIMISED” suit on.  Another reason we wear masks, because how are people supposed to know I have 3 potential comorbidities that I was born with?</p>
<p>Furthermore, every single person pushing for Medicare for all.. cares about you.</p>
<p>Be well, stay safe, or not.. I guess it’s your choice.  But your choice to infect other people, it is not.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re catching a bit of attitude back due to the one your putting out there.  And if it’s frustration, that’s understandable, but your frustration is misdirected.</p>
<p>Other counties have beat this shit, we’re just collectively so dumb we probably never will.</p>

        <p>I used to work with someone who had an autoimmune disease. She would count her cash drawer, then eat chips and donuts without washing her hands all day. She used to laugh at me because I washed my hands before snacking, obsessively.</p>
<p>Anyway, I went to a bar and posted a picture. Cue the paragraphs long text message about how I'm killing grandmas by going out during a global pandemic, and how people like her with suppressed immune systems aren't safe because of people like me.</p>

They don't need to rely on the general population sacrificing every aspect of normal life for them. They have lived thier whole life knowing an infection could be devastating to them.</p>

        <p>That is all it is. A huge projection of the true ugliness of people.</p>
<p>I have immunocompromised people in my family and so have always known to be extra cautious and shit around them, and they have always been extra cautious themselves. </p>
<p>That was my first thought when all of this tripe came about. "Where was this level of care and caution before?" Because nothing has changed for immunocompromised people! </p>
<p>Even a member of my family who has to be cautious are wanting things locked down and masks to be worn. Ive tried making them question what has actually changed in regards to how they live, and their response is just that this virus would kill them instantly. So would the flu! They didn't hide away and stop living for that! They only worry so much now because its in their face daily with masks and the news. </p>
<p>If I bring up the fact I have family members who are vulnerable im asked why the hell im against lockdowns and stuff as if im selfish and uncaring. Like, no, its more annoying hearing that these people care all of a sudden.</p>

        <p>Again, nobody outside your family would really know you’re compromised without telling them.  If they act like an ass afterwards that’s your answer on what kind of person they are.</p>
<p>However, this is an ENTIRELY NEW boogie man.  And there surely will be more.  But you don’t submit to the new boogie man without protection, you do the best you can with the knowledge available.</p>

        <p>They are virtue signalling. They jump on any old bandwagon to feel righteous. They don't care about the racially oppressed or those struggling with mental health. They just pretended to when it was the trend. Then it changes and they throw those people under the bus and move onto screeching about something else. Eventually they'll move on from this too.</p>

        <p>My great grandma died of viral pnumonia. At that time no one gave a damn about masking or social distancing or contact tracing who infected her. We realised she was very old and in poor health and we lamented that better medical treatment was not available, but we never blamed ordinary people as murderers because they infected her while living their ordinary life doing ordinary things. The hypocrisy displayed now is at amazing levels.</p>

        <p>I have to take a medication that suppressed my immune system for life because of an illness when I was a little kid. My parents never sheltered me and I lived like a normal kid. Never got seriously sick. I actually seem to get sick a lot less than most people which is odd. Imagine if my parents sheltered me out of fear and I never got to have a childhood. Unfortunately that may become a reality for many children.</p>

        <p>Just remember the exact same people chirping for years about mental health awareness, are the ones who shout down anyone who wants to talk about the suicide rate..</p>
<p>If I hadn't escaped psychosis last year, i'd probably have killed myself in 2020. I wonder how many undiagnosed schizophrenics the goverment has indirectly killed, those are usually the suicides that perplex family and friends even in a normal year, the "we had no idea" ones, just imagine how anonymous &amp; unknown these people feel this year. And how many more have died because of it.</p>

        <p>Good to hear some someone who is anti-lockdown/mask and as well has an autoimmune condition. This post made me feel slightly more sane after a day of being shamed from other shoppers for not having a mask, a few days before Ontario goes into lockdown. Getting bad over here.</p>

        <p>I completely agree. No one cared about my debilitating fatigue until they started looking at Long Covid. I've been on steroids and immunosuppressants for most of my adult life. Being admitted to hospital for intravenous antibiotics for painful kidney infections usually got me. I even had Covid-19 myself. I was sick for two months, it was awful and I even started hallucinating. There is nothing quite like it but still, the global response is not warranted. Even if I had died, I still wouldn't want all of the suffering that's happening in light of this. I don't expect people to have their lives wrecked to protect me and I don't agree with it.</p>

        <p>Stay safe out there man. I know that their overblowing can lead to our own underplaying, but for those who are compromised and have comorbidities don’t want this. Lost a long-time friend to covid recently. Stay safe. Wash your hands. Tell your loved ones you love them.

        <p>THANK YOU. my friend has a friend who has basically no immune system and at this point she is willing to take her chances, as is my very overweight aunt with several health problems. It's their choice. Here in the UK, everyone is so pissed off at the government that even if another short, strict lockdown was implemented, so many people wouldn't follow it....and more to the point, as soon as they started to gradually reopen the economy, cases would obviously go up like they did the first time because IT IS NOT WORKING. </p>
<p>People say 'well, immunocompromised people cant stay inside forever'. Correct. It feels like a lose/lose situation right now tbh.</p>

        <p>I agree with most of your sentiments. Even if I was dying of COVID I would not blame anyone else-- that is life, that is nature. But most of the people I know who are pro-lockdowns and masks are either 1) Terrified to an existential level by the lies in the news 2) Extremely empathetic people who have been misguided / had their empathy weaponized against them by the lies in the news, or 3) Both. I don't think it is productive to take a hateful stance against a whole group of people. You know, we could go round and round forever with liberals hating conservatives and vice versa, both with legitimate reasons, but that won't fix this shit. Let's do better.</p>

        <p>Yup. Immunocompromised people have always been at risk for worse outcomes. People only “care about the immunocompromised” w/ covid because it’s politically convenient for them to do so</p>

        <p>This post really struck a chord with me. You, OP, are the truly selfless one. I think this really resonates with me because I have several family members who are “high risk” or “vulnerable.” Despite the fact that only the very elderly may be at risk from dying of Covid, there are so many fear mongering stories in the media that make us feel otherwise. </p>
<p>I lost my Dad (64) unexpectedly last June. He most likely passed from a pulmonary embolism. In the days/weeks that followed, I received zero sympathy from my boss, a superintendent of a public school district that would not let me out of my contract to move to a job closer to my Mom and family. </p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t feel bad for those affected by Covid or death, I just feel like there’s millions of people who’ve had to restart their lives/ deal with grief and the loss of loved ones before this. All of a sudden, this disease, among so many others, is supposed to be worse? The only mentality which helps someone overcome the sadness of death is to live life to the fullest- to truly embrace and live life for the moment. No days are guaranteed. Unfortunately, this is the complete opposite view of all the Doomers out there.</p>

        <p>I agree with most of your sentiments. Even if I was dying of COVID I would not blame anyone else-- that is life, that is nature. But most of the people I know who are pro-lockdowns and masks are either 1) Terrified to an existential level by the lies in the news 2) Extremely empathetic people who have been misguided / had their empathy weaponized against them by the lies in the news, or 3) Both. I don't think it is productive to take a hateful stance against a whole group of people. When did that ever work out?</p>

        <p>This doesn’t make any sense. If you’re immunocompromised, why are you advocating for something that is objectively harmful to you? Now, more than ever you should be advocating for lockdowns and masks and for people to get the vaccine because you are one of the most at risk members of the population. But now you say to hell with it? For what? Why? There’s no consistency in this argument.</p>

        <p>The difference being that the diseases you mention don't have the virulence that COVID has shown, and depending on what part of the world you're in aren't really problems.</p>
<p>More importantly is that mask-wearing reduces the spread to people, in general, reducing infection and <em>keeping the burden on healthcare services down</em>. If hospitals are spread too thin because of COVID, there's no way they can adequately respond to the typical seasonal issues, like the flu. By masking up and reducing the spread, generally, it eases the burden on hospitals allowing them to be ready for the typical diseases they deal with year after year.</p>

<p>You realize you're comparing two completely different groups, right?</p>
<p>Among people wearing masks, flu cases are down. Among those refusing to mask up, COVID infection is much higher. The good part of all of this is that there are more mask-wearers than not, which keeps the seasonal flu outbreak down.</p>

        <p>I’m going to assume you’re commenting I’m good faith, so this too is intended to be a good faith reply. Let’s try to keep it that way.</p>
<p>I don’t actually in principle terribly mind wearing the mask. I’d rather not wear it, I don’t like the loss of communication it introduces, but it’s not the hill I’m going to die on.</p>
<p>I do mind the sudden religion that has been built up around masks so that it’s suddenly ok to bully 2 year old children on airplanes - this at least should be a signal to us that something has gotten out of balance and yet instead, predominantly the response has been hate and shame for the family. I mean... I thought we said we cared about children?</p>
<p>I do mind disrupting all of normal life for what are truly specious reasons; instead of focusing on care and prudence for the high risk, as we’ve basically always done for centuries, somehow it became holy to destroy everyone’s lives, livelihoods and humanity. I don’t honestly understand how that happened and it’s ... disheartening.</p>

        <p>It's really not hard to comprehend. We wear masks to stop hospitals becoming overwhelmed and collapsing. Simple. In the UK, that is the primary reason for wearing masks and locking down. When too many people are hospitalised for covid, it fills up the ICUs which means people with other life threatening illnesses won't have beds etc. </p>
<p>I get your frustrations, but this is on such a huge scale and yes whilst Corona isn't life threatening to a lot of people, it could result in so many preventable deaths due to overcrowded hospitals.</p>

        <p>Please go educate yourself. Masks do not stop aerosols, let alone a microscopic particle. Period! Of masks worked then numbers wouldn’t be going up by your logic. Look. The only thing you are promoting when you wear a mask is bacteria. Stop spreading propaganda.</p>

        <p>That’s what they told us but it’s obviously not true. Hospitals never got full in the vast majority of places. If it was to keep ICUs from becoming overcrowded it should have ended long ago. Instead we are still being forced to wear masks 8 months later with no end in sight. It is about compliance and control, nothing else.</p>

        <p>Congratulations on repeating exactly what the mainstream media has been repeating.  Do you have any definitive proof that hospitals have ever been more overwhelmed than they typically are at this time of year?  Do you understand that responding by saying 'no but they would be if we didn't wear masks' doesn't make any sense given that everywhere you go people are wearing them yet you're still going into another lock down?</p>

        <p>There's nothing to suggest that hospitals are actually overwhelmed. And guess what - they <em>were</em> overrun in the 2018 flu season, but we kept on going because we have to. Now we shut down society because they <em>might be</em>?? Hospitals are always at close to full because they too, are a business, and it wastes money and resources to have them half full.</p>

        <p>According to records from the DHHS the vast majority of American hospitals are not overwhelmed, and those that are at high capacity are within numbers that are the norms seen in the last fifteen years. There are a few emergency tent hospitals set up but that was also the case during the flu seasons of 2018, 2016, 2009-2010.</p>
<p>"The daily mail" published a story claiming that a hospital near me was "near collapse". Nothing could be further from the truth. I was in that hospital and it was not overflowing, many beds were empty, the waiting room had 3 people. </p>
<p>My point is don't beleive what the talking heads tell you. If they dont know a thing they will lie about it which they are doing constantly.</p>

        <p>&rt; it could result in so many preventable deaths due to overcrowded hospitals.</p>
<p>In this particular case, that rings a bit hollow; OP is asking “why did nobody care before?” The US and indeed the world is full of preventable death - if I had been born into a world where when someone is sick, they stay home, and if they MUST go out they wear a mask, and they don’t travel till they’re better; I’d consider it normal.</p>
<p>Except we didn’t do that.</p>
<p>And we aren’t doing it now.</p>
<p>If we did so it might fairly make the case that we ACTUALLY care about preventable death.</p>
<p>No, now, we are destroying everyone’s lives to avoid the 3 in 1000 that will die due to this disease, predominantly among the elderly who have never actually been asked if they prefer dying alone and isolated. We never felt this trade off to be a balanced one, ever in human history. Why now?</p>
