    <strong>Difference in mRNA vaccine and vaccines like poliovirus, smallpox, tuberculosis, etc</strong>
    <p><p>Are there any concise sources that discuss the differences in these vaccines?</p></p>

        <p>mRNA (Moderna, Pfizer) and rDNA vectored (J&amp;J, AstraZen) vaccines send instructions to your cells to manufacture spike glycoproteins. NYT has very detailed articles explaining how each of the pseudo-vaxxes works.</p>
<p>Polio, TB and smallpox use either inactivated or attenuated whole virus/bacteria to teach your body to recognise the WHOLE pathogen and to mount an innate and adaptive immune system response. </p>
<p>For the first time in a very long time, I would even recommend that you use Wikipedia and its footnotes to get the peer-reviewed sources because these are old-fashioned ACTUAL vaccines.</p>

        <p>So, mRNA attempts to essentially modify your immune system to nullify the effect of virus protein spikes and in turn its ability to establish itself? Regular vaccines introduce some sample of a virus to allow your immune system to be exposed to it, Which equips it with the knowledge to fight future natural infection more rapidly/effectively?</p>

        <p>Theoretically, the pseudo-vaxxes simply send instructions to your ribosomes to manufacture spike glycoproteins. Your immune system is then expected to mount an innate immune response against the spikes. Your adaptive system will remember (through B and T cells) how to neutralise the spikes. </p>
<p>In reality, the composition of the vaxxes is not open source so we cannot reverse engineer either kind of vaxx to prove/disprove the BigPharma's claims. The fact that the genetic material introduced to the cells is designed to code for a specific spike glycoprotein, which means that the slightest mutation will render the vaxxes ineffective.</p>
<p>The dark reality is that when synthetic genetic material is dumped into our cells, they CAN be integrated into the human DNA in the nucleus without reverse transcriptase (ref: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o9f1ix/no_human_reverse_transcriptase_no_problem_pol%CE%B8/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o9f1ix/no_human_reverse_transcriptase_no_problem_pol%CE%B8/</a></p>

<p>You're right about the regular vaxxes. I would add that since the entire pathogen is introduced, the body can deal with mutations (variants and strains) because a virus won't mutate 100%. Contrary to post-2020 pseudoscience, a pathogen can mutate as much as 99.99% and the adaptive immune system will be able to generate neutralising antibodies against the 0.01% of the pathogen's protein surface that did not mutate. BUT not before the innate immune system has tried its best to nuke the pathogen (even if it were 100% mutated).</p>
