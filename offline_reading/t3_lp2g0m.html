    <strong>What people who yell "conspiracy theorist" really are</strong>
    <p><p>We are in an abusive relationship with our governments.  </p>
<p><a href="https://infographicnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/psychology-8-warning-signs-of-an-abusive-relationship-infographic.jpg">Here's an infographic showing the signs of an abusive relationship</a> </p>
<p>To summarise: <br>
<strong>1. Intensity</strong> - non-stop fear mongering propaganda in news and advertisting<br>
<strong>2. Jealousy</strong> - don't look at what other countries are doing (no lockdowns)<br>
<strong>3. Control</strong> - strict, arbitrary rules, eg. don't sit on benches<br>
<strong>4. Isolation</strong> - stay at home, don't see friends and family<br>
<strong>5. Criticism</strong> - eg. hit pieces on people going to the beach<br>
<strong>6. Sabotage</strong> - small-medium businesses failing through lockdowns<br>
<strong>7. Blame</strong> - if you'd all worn a mask and distanced properly from the start, this would all be over<br>
<strong>8. Anger</strong> - police showing up at protests and attacking peaceful protesters  </p>
<p>Coaches who specialise in supporting people leaving abusive relationships immediately noticed the signs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1o--TPzZQs">This is a video from Meredith Miller</a> validating those who have also noticed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUZDCLKA6Fg">And here are</a> a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FYU4j02fGk">couple of videos</a> from Richard Grannon which mention neurolinguistic programming and psychological operations in particular.   </p>
<p>Things to know about abusive relationships. They don't get better. Over time the abuse, and particularly the control will tend to ramp up. It takes someone in an abusive relationship an average of 7 attempts to leave that relationship. Some never leave and waste away. Some are killed by their abusive partner. We need to be strong and leave.  </p>
<p>So what are the people who yell "conspiracy theorist"? Say you know a woman in a bad relationship. Her husband controls and disrespects her and you suspect he's also cheating on her. She's very unhappy but she doesn't think she can survive without him. One day you see him at a party making out with a woman and they leave together. You tell her but she yells at you. You don't know where they were going. Besides, you're probably remembering wrong. She gets even angrier. Actually, you're just trying to break up her marriage because you're jealous.  </p>
<p>She doesn't want to process the information even though though the evidence is strong because it will destabilise her whole world. He has in fact already destabilised her world but she is <em>in denial</em>. That's what people who yell "conspiracy theorist" are - they are in denial that their government is abusive.</p></p>

        <p>This is one reason I am sometimes heavily misanthropic. The human mind fights obscenely hard to convince itself everything is the same as always and is really ok, a process called "normalization." It's a fundamental aspect of the human cognitive function and can't be avoided. There are lots of these little "bugs" in the human brain that are easy to exploit and it happens all the time (it's easier to fool someone than to convince them they've been fooled, the famous Twain quote, is another example - Dunning Kruger effect).</p>
<p>We have tried for millennia to put systems in place that blunt the impact of our worst bugs, but those same bugs are so damn resilient that we are forced to pay in blood for progress every 100 years or so only to start the cycle again.</p>
<p>I've never found a convincing reason to think we'll ever do better.</p>
