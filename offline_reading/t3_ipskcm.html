    <strong>Help me understand pro-lockdown mentality</strong>
    <p><p>Hey fellow skeptics. I’m feeling rather low and hopeless today and in these situations I start losing my ability to think straight. Help me out with this one:</p>
<p>I keep reading posts and comments by pro-lockdown people claiming that “we didn’t do it right the first time and that’s why it’s out of control now” or that unending lockdowns are the actual flattening of the curve. At this point, I just don’t get how anyone with half a brain and earnest ability to seek out information can keep this opinion anymore.  Any place that “won” the battle with covid by widespread restrictions only face the virus picking up right where it left off once restrictions are lifted. And that makes sense because covid acts like every other contagious respiratory virus. </p>
<p>And I give a lot of lockdowners the credit of being pretty intelligent and thoughtful in other avenues of life, but this area is a huge blind spot. I’d love to have a repository of honest theories to this phenomenon to hold onto when I’m feeling low and overwhelmed as I am today.</p></p>

        <p>Sunk cost fallacy. If we admit we are wrong now, then everything is was a waste. </p>
<p>Infallibility of Authority.  If we admit the experts are wrong, then we have to admit that a lot of things experts say is wrong.  Its easier to trust the experts than engage in critical thinking.  Plus, you can never go wrong with appealing to science and reason. </p>
<p>Anti-Trump. I am not a Trump supporter by any means, but lockdowns / COVID have clearly been weaponized against Trump.  Its a useful tool to highlight the "good" Democrats versus the "uneducated" Republicans.  See also virtue-signaling. </p>
<p>Click-bait (aka the dog that did not bark).  Nobody clicks on a head-line that says schools have been in session in Amsterdam for the past several months with no deaths from COVID.   But one kid gets sick in a red state and its automatically front page news and forwarded endlessly via Twitter, the Book of Faces, etc. </p>
<p>Confirmation bias. Similar to the above, everyone seeks out "facts" and news to support their position. This creates a feedback loop. Pro-lockdowners  will credit a headline that says 250k people infected after Sturgis as gospel because it fits the narrative, but BLM protests continually get a pass. * This being said <em>everyone</em> is a sucker for this *</p>
<p>Heads-I-win/ Tails-you-lose.  If cases go, up it is because everyone is not complying properly, which means more lockdowns; if cases go down, its because lockdowns and masks are working so we need to keep doing them.   Its a feedback loop which no politician can break, because better to keep precautions in place than to risk loosening them and having more "cases." </p>
<p>Inertia. No one ever loses their job (in government) for assuming and reacting to the worst case scenario. Better to keep things close indefinitely, schools online, capacity limited, rather than for an administrator to jeopardize their career position and reputation. If this fails, they can always falls back on just following orders (looking at you school super-intendents).  See Fauci's comment at the beginning - if it seems I overreacted, then I am doing my job.</p>
<p>The beat goes on.</p>

        <p>I would add.</p>
<p>Some people genuinely prefer things locked down. Think about someone working for Microsoft in Seattle. They have an hour commute both ways with terrible traffic that can double that commute. They live in a home that is ridiculously expensive, that they never get to enjoy because of their commute. Then at work they have to deal with an annoying boss, annoying coworkers, office politics, busy work, etc. But they can't quit because they need that high paying tech job to afford their overpriced home. But then covid hits. They are forced to work from home. And just like that, no more commute. No boss looking over their shoulder. No annoying coworkers. No stretching 4 hours of actual work into 8, just so their boss doesn't get mad. Now they can work in their pajamas. No need to wake up at 5 AM to beat rush hour. Now they get to spend time with their family and actually enjoy their home. Maybe they can finally do some of those home improvement projects they never had time for. They are able to finally save money (they most likely have crazy student debt, and all their savings went to the down payment on their house), because they can't eat out as much or go on vacation. All this while not having to lose their salary or benefits. They are compensated the same, but now get to enjoy all the things they were sacrificing due to having to go to the office. These people never want things to go back to "normal". They will look for whatever information/talking point they can that will allow them to justify not going back to how things were. They will ignore logic, data, common sense, and other people suffering, because they desperately don't want to return to the misery that was their life before covid.</p>

<p>One word, OP: Fear. Not just any old fear either, but utter, abject terror of their own mortality that only ~~the greatest propaganda apparatus in human history~~ the modern mainstream media could promote.</p>

        <p>Two words: presidential election. </p>
<p>Democrats and the media see Covid chaos as a Trump failure so they need it to be as bad as possible so Trump loses the election. </p>
<p>If it weren’t an election year, no one would care. If Clinton were president, no one would care. If Biden wins and next year COVID is twice as deadly, no one will care. </p>
<p>It’s just like how when Bush was president they reported on every single soldier that died in Iraq or Afghanistan. Even though soldiers died while Obama was president, they never talked about it. And no one mentioned H1N1 deaths under Obama. </p>
<p>Just like they blamed AIDS deaths on Reagan but never mentioned them during Clinton’s presidency. And even though JFK &amp; Johnson ramped up Vietnam and Nixon ended Vietnam, guess who gets blamed for Vietnam - Republicans. </p>
<p>It’s a tale as old as time.</p>

        <p>We have many many more people who are much much more mobile, and we also have many more seniors. Northern Italy, which has many seniors, also got hit very hard. America has a bustling economy in all walks of life. New Zealand is big for tourism which shut down rather quickly. </p>
<p>In areas of the US that are similar to those examples you mentioned - like South Dakota for example - rates weren’t bad at all. The crazy numbers of NY, CA, MI, and NJ account for most of it for the US.</p>

        <p>The media - The media has given millions of people who sit inside and do nothing all day a purpose and power in life. They narc and snitch on those not following their rules because it makes them feel good about themselves.

        <p>Fear is a big part. </p>
<p>But also ... stupid, egotistical human brains. When you invest heavily in believing something, when you yell at your mom for seeing a friend for tea, when you lose friends because they refuse to live like hermits indefinitely, when you advocate for the intentional destruction of the economy until you’re blue in the face ... your top priority eventually becomes simply “not being proven wrong.” No matter how many lives you tear to pieces to avoid the horror of owning your mistake. </p>
<p>Also, this is a common thing I see: </p>
<p>&rt; my friends are usually so intelligent and thoughtful, but on this one issue they are completely irrational </p>
<p>People often like to use the fear excuse to solve this conflict: they are intelligent but right now they are scared and fear makes them irrational. </p>
<p>And that’s a fair excuse when you’re scared of imminent death. It may have been a fair excuse the first few weeks of lockdowns. But ... it’s been months, and at some point during this time, all of the intelligent people have (a) noticed they haven’t died and (b) done some basic research and critical thinking. </p>
<p>The most likely explanation for an intelligent person still being irrational about covid at this point ... your original assessment was wrong, and they’re simply not all that intelligent.</p>
