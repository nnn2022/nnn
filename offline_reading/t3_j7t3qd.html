        <p>Interesting. I’d imagine people will say something like “the numbers”, “I stand with science”, or “trust the experts”. </p>
<p>But...my trust in science is not limited to some guy on the news relaying some message from some scientist out in Washington. </p>
<p>Yes, I know we trust others to do things like package our food securely, to create medicine, to keep us safe in cars and planes, etc. you get the idea....but when the livelihood of the entire globe relies on a few people out there on TV, then yes. I’m gonna question it. There is an incredible amount at stake here. </p>
<p>Not only that, but what I see with my eyes, and what I see on TV/the news are drastically different....then I am questioning the narrative.</p>

        <p>I may be downvoted for not following directions, but IDGAF.  </p>
<p>I’ll tell you why I DON’T trust my government:</p>
<p>I used to blindly believe my government had my best interests at heart, that we were the good guys, the evil Soviets were the bad guys.  Then I grew up and came of age in a world where despite being told I have a right that shall not be infringed, it’s chipped away a little every day.  A world where though I’m secure in my papers and possessions, carrying a large amount of cash is evidence enough that cash is intended for criminal purposes and can be seized so the government can buy itself more nice things.  A world where despite it stopping exactly 0 acts of terror, I have to let some lowlife federal meter maid paw through my possessions and take my shoes off to travel.  And if all that isn’t enough, a government that tried to collect every communication I ever made they could search later for an excuse to prosecute me because a warrant from a secret, unaccountable court is just so much bother.  The guy who campaigned against the program for president even expanded said program; leaving me 2 options: believe either a: a Nicholas cage movie was historically accurate and the book of secrets contains information so heinous the president must curtail my freedom because I’m a baby who can’t make my own risk assessments, or B: the government is full of a bunch of power hungry authoritarians. </p>
<p>This is further supported by the fact that the very people who created our government said not to trust it and a revolution is good every 20 years or so. </p>
<p>So yeah, wear that security blanket that they told you wasn’t effective until they said it was, that doesn’t have to be following any standard for particulate, let alone aerosol containment as long as it’s there, and they don’t actually really enforce anyway if it makes you feel safe.  This line to suck my dick if you think you’re making me wear one forms to the right.</p>

        <p>&rt; the government is full of a bunch of power hungry authoritarians.</p>
<p>I used to think this, then I did some work around government entities.  I found that individually government workers have similar desires of workers in the private sector.  The differences however are that workers in the government sector have VERY different organizational incentives.  Government entities have no incentive to be fiscally sound, they have no incentive to be effective, they only have an incentive to be effective in the eyes of their political overseers.  In addition there is little to no economic pressure from the potential of failure.  To me when you combine that perspective of incentives (I tend to think of things in terms of economic incentives) the behavior of government tends to fit the model very well.</p>

        <p>I had this argument recently.</p>
<p>Trump is somehow to blame for 210k covid deaths because he did not push mask usage.
But Obama is somehow blameless in 242k flu deaths, also not having pushed mask usage.</p>
<p>The double standard is incredible.</p>

        <p>The difference is the Flu kills ~30,000 per year and has for decades. This is similar to all other comparable countries in the world. Just as you don't fault them no one would expect a president to bring that number to 0. Now, we're talking about 210k deaths in 7 months. Other countries have kept that number to under 1/5th or even 1/10th per capita of what the US has seen. Why are we so bad in this metric? I don't know who else is to blame other than the current highest leadership.</p>

<p>Similar to how covid's danger is heavily skewed by age, the impact in the US is heavily skewed by state. Nww York, for example, has had the highest mortality rate. Though it accounts for &lt;6% of the population, it has almost 16% of all US covid deaths.</p>
<p>The issue hasn't been a lack of nationwide mask usage, or other preventative measure. The issue has been the existence of policies in 5 states that have actively increased the spread to the most susceptible population.</p>

<p>I don't know what you're saying here. There are tremendous efforts that go into minimizing annual flu deaths. Just as there are tremendous efforts that do into preventing traffic deaths. But no one expects these to go to zero and unless there is an outlier year we aren't going to blame leaders for every single death. </p>

<p>There are 16 states that are above the US average deaths per capita at 658 per million. (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) Both red and blue states. Which shouldn't matter because all of these states fall under the per view of the President.</p>

<p>Many countries have implemented measures that have kept the cases down, such as lockdowns. But not living in a dictatorship and having the 1st amendment, people have the right to gather. Given the number of cases, the US is about "middle of the pack" in terms of mortality rate, even including the intentional nursing home infections.</p>
<p>&rt;So the president has no blame or responsibility on the health of the states? Does federal funding not exist in your world?</p>
<p>I didn't state that there was "no" responsibility. However, it's also not all unilateral. For example, the president tried to temporarily halt immigration from affected areas, but was blocked by congress. He mobilized the Navy's floating hoslitals (which ended up being almost unused), and tasked Ford and GM with mask and ventilator production.</p>
<p>In terms of federal funds, you're confusing the head of one branch of the federal government with the federal government as a whole (or at least congress, whose in charge of funding). But even the <em>federal</em> funding is state directed. For example, the CARES act, granting federal funding to the states became law in March. It has been held, at least in Pennsylvania, by Governor Wolfe until now.</p>

<p>We are all humans. The mortality rate is largely a factor of healthcare quality, age of population and pre-existing conditions. I shouldn't care nearly as much about mortality rate as I do deaths per capita. If a country has one case and that person dies but another country with the same population has 500X more infections with 100X more deaths which country would you rather be?</p>
<p>&rt;The president tried to temporarily halt immigration from affected areas, but was blocked by congress. </p>
<p>Source? Is this what what done on April 21st? (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-s-immigration-ban-raises-more-questions-answers-here-s-n1188946). The virus was rampant in this country already and has been since. Just like banning China was too late because it was already in Europe these actions didn't appear to have much of an affect based on our current rankings in death per capita. </p>
<p>47 of the 50 states have a worse death per capita rate than Germany. So almost every state is failing. Who is MOST to blame if most states are failing. This is a connected country and a virus who doesn't care about state boundaries.</p>

<p>Unless the government policies affected the populations infected.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you're right. We're all humans and would be effected in a similar way. Along with that, we all equally share the right to make decisions such as gathering peacefully. To blame a third party for an individual's decision to do so would be ridiculous. </p>
<p>&rt;47 of the 50 states have a worse death per capita rate than Germany.</p>
<p>As I said, the deaths per capita is misleading. In Germany, the total death rate has only been kept low because the infection rate has been kept low. Because of that, the population's still uninoculated and susceptible. Just yesterday, Germany's health Minister waned that they may be about to see covid spread uncontrollably through Germany now that it's spiking again in Europe. They're not saving lives, they're just dragging the pain out over a longer period. </p>
<p>&rt;If a country has one case and that person dies but another country with the same population has 500X more infections with 100X more deaths which country would you rather be?</p>
<p>If the increased infections are because peolle are choosing to exercise additional freedom rather than the government intentionally infecting them, I'd prefer the freedom. If I want the same level of danger as the less infected country, I still have the freedom to further restrain myself. Further, if it's been going on for any considerable period of time, I'd much prefer the country with numerous infections. There's a level of safety built ip there that doesn't exist in the other.</p>

        <p>&rt;Unless the government policies affected the populations infected.</p>
<p>Government policies do affect the number of people infected?</p>
<p>&rt;Beyond that, you're right. We're all humans and would be effected in a similar way. Along with that, we all equally share the right to make decisions such as gathering peacefully. To blame a third party for an individual's decision to do so would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you're saying here but the reality is someone else's decision to continue reckless human interactions will continue the spread of the virus and thus make it more likely that others are to contract it. That means those actions are affecting and harming fellow citizens. Just like you don't have a right to speed 100 mph down the highway you don't have a right to recklessly harm fellow citizens. Failure to put in place to implement frameworks that will decrease spread are the fault of the leadership as well as inividuals themselves for not recognizing this reality. </p>
<p>&rt;As I said, the deaths per capita is misleading. In Germany, the total death rate has only been kept low because the infection rate has been kept low. Because of that, the population's still uninoculated and susceptible. Just yesterday, Germany's health Minister waned that they may be about to see covid spread uncontrollably through Germany now that it's spiking again in Europe. They're not saving lives, they're just dragging the pain out over a longer period.</p>
<p>This is largely dependent on your belief that a vaccine will be available and effective enough in a reasonable time. The current administration thinks that will happen this year. More conservative estimates have this at next spring. Yes it sucks to live like this but the alternative of 100k's of more deaths is pretty unreasonable too. Many countries have gotten back to more levels of normalcy while we wait for a vaccine because they've taken it seriously. I doubt that will happen here unfortunately but its not a good excuse to go A-wall on our vulnerable population. </p>
<p>&rt;If the increased infections are because peolle are choosing to exercise additional freedom rather than the government intentionally infecting them, I'd prefer the freedom. If I want the same level of danger as the less infected country, I still have the freedom to further restrain myself. Further, if it's been going on for any considerable period of time, I'd much prefer the country with numerous infections. There's a level of safety built ip there that doesn't exist in the other.</p>

        <p>&rt;Government policies do affect the number of people infected?</p>
<p>In the US, the policies effecting the infections were those putting people into nursing homes. The spread otherwise is not due to policies, but due to natural human interactions. Unless you're suggesting that humans not be able to interact, but again, you can choose to forego this without a government restriction. </p>
<p>&rt;This is largely dependent on your belief that a vaccine will be available and effective enough in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>This fear was voiced today, due to a current uptick im cases in Germany. However, this is largely irrelevant. If we claim that it is rightfully the government's decision if we can leave our houses, etc. (it's not, but I'll humor the idea for this argument) and say that the right decision is based entirely on the number of deaths (ignoring the plummeting quality-adjusted life year, increased domestic violence rates, etc.), and say the right decision is simply to follow the estimates: the lockdowns were still wrong. Given the world-wide population, mortality rate, and herd immunity rate, an unmitigated covid would still kill fewer people than the WFP estimated would starve due to the economic impacgs of the shutdown in just the first 3 months.</p>
<p>&rt;I'd rather be Free and dead than alive and not able to do certain activities. Sure that's logical.</p>
<p>In a free society, are you not welcome to remain indoors as though you live in a restricted society? The issue here is not your germophobia. It's your demand that all others live by it, when this is statistically safer than the flu for the majority of the population.</p>

<p>What YOU do affects OTHERS. That is the reality of the virus. Yes, I can stay away from others when it makes sense to like I am. but If I intended to get back to some level of normalcy and safety before a vaccine that requires everyone to be on board. YOU speeding on the highway can kill me and my family. YOU continuing to spread a disease can kill me and my family. There are plenty of examples in society where you are not FREE to do what you want because it HARMS others. That is where this lies and it shouldn't be difficult to grasp.</p>

<p>There were plenty of similar measures taken in 1918. This is a generational virus. Saying something doesn't apply now because you think it hasn't before is a pretty soft argument. If an asteroid was coming toward earth do you think there would be some unprecedented measures taken?</p>

        <p>Or any other health problems. At the moment I think the majority of the panicking sheep are people who have never had a serious health problem in their lives. They don't understand just how little the government cares about people with chronic health conditions. It's not like we had a fully functioning healthcare system before that the "pandemic" suddenly destroyed - for decades people have been suffering because the government doesn't care that they can't afford their meds, or that they can't get a doctor's appointment, or that they've been on a medical procedure waiting list for years. People who haven't had health problems before haven't seen any of this, and I think it means that they put too much value on quantity of life over quality.</p>

        <p>Aside from Trump's concern for foreign policy and the economy, I don't have any faith that my government cares about the people of America.  But with a strong economy (which means zero lockdowns) and a good foreign policy (which means no wars), I am capable of taking care of myself which is all I need.</p>
<p>Is that a good enough answer?</p>

        <p>I can think of no evidence that my government cares about me <em>personally</em>, let alone my well-being. 
I can say my government cares about its people, collectively.
It cares the way a golf course cares about the green. It cares about the overall green, not an individual blade of grass. </p>
<p>How does government show they care collectively? They pass laws and ordinances that make communities clean and desirable to live in. They pass safety laws. They maintain the roads for safer driving conditions. </p>
<p>Now Let’s dig a little deeper and ask <em>why</em> they care enough to do these things?</p>
<p>1- sometimes , the people come together and demand these types of things of the government. Government leaders want to stay in office so they do what the majority of voters want.  </p>
<p>2- the government might enact certain laws and safety requirements to avoid liability. Government leaders don’t want that hassle, and, it makes them look bad. </p>
<p>So. .  I’d say in conclusion, that the government and its leaders care about us only as far as it benefits them.</p>

        <p>Lol which communities are you talking about? Rich neighborhoods look nice becuase those areas collect more municipal taxes. The federal government wholly ignored most poor  neighborhoods to the extent that some of them look like 3rd world countries. The homeless are almost completely ignored. Food kitchens are going to run  out of food because of the covid lockdowns and i havent heard shit from the federal government in a possible solution. Idk if you have ever been to some of the poorest neighborhoods in LA or any other major city, but I happen to work on one of the poorest neighborhoods in east LA and holy shit what mess. The government forgot about those communities a long time ago</p>

        <p>I'll address these two questions. What evidence do I have my government cares about me? The government has a responsibility to the general public. The evidence of this: In the constitution preamble, the part "...  provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity ..." gives ample proof that our government has an aspiration to follow (at bare minimum). While it might not "care about me and my wellbeing", it does have a responsibility to promote the general welfare, which includes myself.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As far as how that warrants me blindly believing in my government and offering them a similar obedience, it doesn't. I think there is a free market of ideas, and generally the best ideas float to the top. Eventually, we can agree that math is a more accurate description of the world than astrology. Eventually, people in charge of "... promoting the general welfare..." may agree that it's a good idea to force everyone to wear a mask during a pandemic. But hey, it's a free market of ideas, so think what you want.</p>

        <p>Government only serves to strip away the rights of it's citizens, and protect criminals from those who they wrong.  I'm not saying government should be totally abolished, but most everything the government does can be privatized, and be much more effective.  The government's only purpose should be to defend the nation's borders, and protect the rights of it's citizens.</p>

        <p>It’s not so much “trust in the government” as it is that I only have access to so much info. I did my own reading on masks and how effect they are/aren’t and made my own choice that it’s probably a good idea right now.  I only have so much time and energy to spend on the subject but it IS possible to not trust the government and to come to ones own conclusion about what is likely happening.  I have a good friend and several people I deeply care about that disagree and that’s okay, too, as long as we are respectful and open to learning from each other.</p>

        <p>I think in a moment of crisis, local, state and federal leadership plays a factor in decision making. It does not define mine, but it is a factor.</p>
<p>If a nuke goes off in LA, I have about 2 -6 hours to leave my area before fallout reaches my house. I have a plan. But additional information from our leadership will be helpful on planing the next step.</p>
<p>Now a nuke is very easy to see the result of. A virus, not so much, so not a perfect apples to apples comparison.</p>
<p>In March leadership called upon its citizenry to make a sacrifice for the common good. Many complied, including me. However, come June the data was no longer supporting the narrative leadership was painting.</p>
<p>It was that point I broke rank in my "citizen's duty".</p>
<p>Do they have my personal best interest at heart? No. Do they want to ensure their citizenry remain effective and productive? Yes. This is why I the information they  disseminate initially plays into my own family's personal plans for crisis. They wish to preserve a functional society from which all their power is derived.</p>

        <p>Not sure this is targeted at anti-lockdowners (I am one) but I can still see that there are some people in the government who mean well. The gov is made up of people. Humans who care about humans. Now that's not to say that this is even relevant. Because the principal-agent problem means that vast groups of people end up not serving the agent (us) and that vested interests take over.</p>

        <p>Great question. Here in the UK the gov only seems to care about one thing - appeasing scientists drunk on attention and hitherto unknown power.</p>
<p>It's sickening. I get covid is dangerous for some...buy not most. Hospitals 'could be full' in a matter of weeks...so we're going to restrict life and shut down livelihoods for your own good.</p>
<p>Fuck that. If hospital is full, use triage and focus whatever resource you have on who will benefit most...as we have always done.</p>
<p>The fact someone else is sick should not mean your work, social or cultural life stops.</p>
<p>Government should be protecting the interest of all citizens, not just those with covid.</p>

        <p>Im HONESTLY, WHOLE HEARTEDLY looking for genuine answers..  the point, yes, is that indeed the government doesnt care— but im hoping people who lurk in this sub that truly believe anything/everything the government/news says can provide some insight that might help me genuinely understand where they are coming from.  Cause I tried to empathetically come up with even one thing, and I couldn’t.. so figured I reach out..  Id get bombarded with “conspiracy theorist” labels and banned if I posted this in any reddit mainstream sub.. so this was best resort.  Simply put, it’s food for thought.</p>

        <p>I'm lurking. Im pretty middle ground on most subjects, and I agree that for the most part thay the government doesn't care. But to play devil's advocate, there's one thing that always comes to mind when people say things like "the government's trying to poison, kill and make us stupid" My brain always defaults to the fact that:
Why would the government want to make EVERYBODY stupid and not try to care for people sometimes. There's many reasons, but the one I come back to is they need us. Not just the masses who work and consume and repeat. But they need people to become doctor's, scientists, politicians. Where do all these people come from? They dont just pop up. They have millions of people who run the government, our hospitals, our research centers, our world affairs, our military etc. All those people arent just keeping some giant secret, and some you may have even lived next door to. I know this page is about masks and shit, but reading this makes me more aware of the people who are on here. It's not as black and white as you think, there are so many factors. 
Now do I think our political system, the way things are run, people are trained and where our money gets funneled to is wrong? Of course, and I barely trust anything the government says. But I don't think they're out to kill us all or make us stupid (some people are born into shit places, and of course I know they are the ones that will be neglected, because we need dumb workers and co sumers)
That's my 2 cents</p>

        <p>I actually agree with this.  Ive always thought the same.  I dont believe they are proactively attempting to kill us.</p>
<p>However.. to counter this.. think about all of the things recently that have gone to robots and automation.  And tracking.  The surface says no big deal.  But if I had relied on millions of people for xyz... what would be the number one way I could shrink that number exponentially?  Automation and robots.   </p>
<p>Then, what do you do with the surplus of people that no longer can contribute?  You monitor and track them.  You dont allow them to even think about starting their own society or living off the land unnoticed... they want everybody and their every action accounted for.  Whats next?  I dont know...  but thats my thought process.</p>

        <p>As someone in California, I can turn on the faucet and drink straight from it without worry. I can go to a park and have a BBQ. When the forests are on fire, they are fought. And every election I am sent a ballot and can participate in choosing who represents me. When there is an emergency or public health crisis, top elected officials personally inform me, and strive to maintain my health and safety.</p>
<p>But government and citizenship is a two-way street (perhaps more uphill in one direction, but still), and so we must be able to trust each other. It is not blind obedience. I respect my local elected officials enough that I will follow their guidance during this crisis.</p>

        <p>This has to do with the particular personalities who are the public faces of governments. In my province, the head of the provincial government gives off strong daddy vibes and people quite openly project a father-figure archetype onto him and say that he makes them feel safe, just like a paterfamilias. I’ve seen Scots use the phrase “mummy Nicola,” so presumably the same phenomenon happens elsewhere.</p>

        <p>What you assholes don't understand is that masks are simply a pragmatic solution to stopping the spread of an infectious disease.  If anything, our government has been too lax in promoting protective policies, but that's neither here nor there.  This is not an issue of governmental authority, it's just a matter of making the personal choice to be a functioning, considerate human being who lives in a society in the midst of a disease outbreak.  I'll say it again, you guys are assholes.</p>

        <p>Lurker here.  Pro mask.  Why would anyone think their government cares about them?  Government is controlled by politicians.  Politicians of ALL parties are slimy creatures in my opinion.  By being pro mask does that mean I have blind obedience to my government?  No.  I have a mom and a sister who are medically fragile.  That’s where my choice to wear a mask in public comes from. I don’t need evidence to support mask use because I’m willing to do it for them.  The mask doesn’t bug me.  It’s a very small thing to me.   But it is sad that by doing this for my loved ones I get told I’m wearing a muzzle or a face diaper 🤷‍♂️. For me my mask is not political. It’s just my personal choice and I don’t really understand why it’s so offensive to other people like some of the people here.  Why do you care if I wear a mask? Why does my mask tell you I am blindly obedient to my government? You don’t know my story just as I don’t know yours.</p>

        <p>I never mentioned mask once in the OP.  But what if youre giving blind obedience into the fact that there’s a pandemic in the first place.  What if you are giving blind obedience to 200k people dying, when it could be that normal deaths that always happen every year are continuing, and theyre just spewing out this garbage to put people in fear, or other agendas.  What if your family members or you never needed to be in a mask in the first place.. and if you/we used our eyes to observe the world instead of listening to the media, we’d realize that nothing catastrophic is taking place.  Admit it.. the only reason you all are in masks is because you watched the news, or someone who watched the news convinced you to do so by instilling fear.  Wish you and your family the best.

        <p>I live in Canada. We had thousands of deaths in old age homes in Quebec in March for people that tested positive for a COVID-19. .  So much so that staff from the army had to go in to work as staff in the care homes. That is not normal deaths that happen ever year.  So in my country there is a pandemic.  In Italy there was a pandemic. If there is no pandemic right now in the US then you are very lucky indeed.</p>

        <p>Look.  You said you were open minded.  Now you are asking if I heard about the dead elderly people and the army working in the homes on the news?  If the publicly operated Canadian Broadcasting Corporation manages to fabricate the entire thing, and kept that hoax going for 7 months we better all head to our bunkers  now.  👀 because we’d have bigger problems. </p>
<p>The Canadian government has paid millions of unemployed people $2,000 a month so they wouldn’t become homeless.  Just putting it out there... but I can’t see any reason for that other than .... I don’t know.... an actual global pandemic?🤔</p>
<p>So, this is my last comment on this thread.  You clearly don’t want to hear anyone’s perspective.  I tell you why I’m wearing a mask and you insist that the MSM scared me into it rather than acknowledging my perspective.  I told you I have medically fragile family members and you still want to tell me I shouldn’t wear a mask.  If I was told to hop on one foot for 3 hours a day to keep my mom alive longer maybe I’d do that too.  I love my mom.  Maybe just maybe not everyone is acting out of fear????  ✌️</p>

        <p>You said to open our eyes and see it, so I'll tell you what I saw. I saw my grandfather and my uncle slowly die over the course of a week from Covid. I saw my roommate spend a week coughing up blood and make three trips to the hospital and he now has permanent lung damage from it. One of my best friends who is a gravedigger has seen a dramatic increase in work at the graveyard he works at, due to covid. He's also seen the building he works get used as an overflow for when other morgues and hospitals ran out of room. I've seen news sources from every country in the world that has news in a language I can read say that there is, indeed, a pandemic. I've spoken to friends around the planet on every continent (except Antarctic because the internet there is ass) who, coincidentally, also are under lockdown and have seen more or less the same thing I have. So even if the government was lying to me (and trust me, I'm a history major I don't trust any of them any farther than I could throw Trump's overweight orange ass) about this thing in particular, why is every government around the world lying at the same time about the same thing, which also happens to line up with things that we are seeing?</p>

        <p>The idea is that if people smoke all their lives, by the time they get cancer and the NHS have to look after them they have effectively paid for their treatment through the taxes they’ve paid on cigarettes.</p>
<p>Similarly with the sugary drinks tax. It follows basic economics. If a very sugary drink costs slightly more than the sugar free version and they both taste more or less the same, then people will tend toward the cheaper sugar free version because it is considered a substitute good.</p>
<p>But this is not the same as limiting the amount of sugar in drinks. Because: </p>
<p>-This can cause problems by making certain products no longer viable.</p>
<p>-It removes the choice from the consumer, it is tyrannical.</p>
<p>-Sugar and sugar free options still cost the same. Meaning it does not encourage the same level of transfer to sugar free.</p>
<p>-It could in fact be illegal under the mutual recognition doctrine found in articles 35-36 in the treaty on the functioning of the European Union... not that it will apply for much longer.</p>

        <p>Interesting thing about smokers and obese people, they cost the healthcare system less over the long run. Average age of lung cancer diagnosis is 70, and average survival is 6 months or so. Old age care is as expensive as hell. No matter how healthy you live, eventually your body will begin to break down. </p>
<p>Here in the US, consider the savings for Medicare and Social Security alone.</p>
<p>Oh, and unfortunately that lady on twitter is a moron. A person with high functioning autism is  more likely to get diagnosed today than 40 years ago. Increasing maternal and paternal age also play a factor. Not vaccines.</p>

        <p>It would be absolutely tyrannical to disallow cigarettes and fried food. How would you even enforce the latter? Would you ban the sale of cooking oil? People have the right to make reasonable decisions about their lifestyle. Even if they’re poor ones. The government tried banning alcohol before on public health grounds. Do you need reminding how that one went?</p>
<p>The second argument might work for the USA but literally nowhere else in the first world. If I am sick then my government loses money, they don’t gain anything.</p>

        <p>It may come as a shock to you but “the world” is not the United States of America. You’re not even 5% of the world’s population. Every restaurant in the world wasn’t and isn’t shut. I can go to one right now because we locked down early for a short period of time while the government paid everyone’s wages and we listened to the advice given. Now everything is fine.</p>
<p>Again. People have the right to make lifestyle decisions that they choose. Even if they’re bad ones. That includes smoking and drinking and eating shitty food. This is understood and respected by the state as they know that any attempt to infringe on peoples right to reasonably indulge themselves has always lead to disaster. This is why alcohol and cigarettes are taxed so highly, because the taxes the government loses out on from you dying at 60 rather than 78 is levelled out by you dumping thousands of dollars into their pocket every year.</p>
<p>Stopping people from dying unnecessarily is obviously in your government’s interest. This is why every civilised nation in the world has fully or near-fully socialised healthcare funded entirely by the state. It’s not based on any sort of altruism. But rather because dead people do not pay taxes or generate economic activity.</p>
<p>Yeah foreign pharmaceuticals definitely benefit from the USA’s absurd laws pertaining for public health. But how would that give my government a vested interest in me being sick? If I get sick THEY have to pay for it. Which is why public health initiatives tend to stick better in places which aren’t the US.</p>
<p>Better yet, ask yourself this. What would a government stand to gain from your death?</p>
<p>Just... you know... being real :)</p>

<p>But it’s not “absolutely tyrannical” to disallow:   <br>
- children from going to school      <br>
- adults from going to work       <br>
- people from socializing with each other/co-mingling outside the household       <br>

- mentally unwell or unstable people from seeing their therapists/seeking help      <br>
- children from playing on playgrounds      <br>
- adults from working out in gym facilities </p>
<p>You’re so close to understanding but not quite there...your first paragraph is literally applicable to every lockdown, social distancing, and mask mandate that has come out of government agencies.</p>

        <p>It would be tyrannical if any of those things were permanent or arbitrary measures.</p>
<p>However they are temporary, and controlling a pandemic is anything but arbitrary. We locked down early and for less than a month whilst the government paid everyone’s wages. Now everything is fine and life is back to normal. This “new normal” shit is almost exclusively an Americanism because you are categorically incapable of just getting your shit together for once.</p>

<p>The government would not be paying for me if I died. That was never even implied let alone suggested. But they would suffer the opportunity cost of me no longer alive.</p>
<p>That is to say, dead people don’t pay income, sales, capital gains, or other tax.</p>

        <p>I don't blindly follow my government or some man on the news. I can do my own research are easily understand that the US has one of the worst deaths per capita rate for any developed country. I can also see that plenty of developed countries have been able to limit their deaths per capita to one tenth of what we have seen. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</p>
<p>How do we get to less deaths? Well probably less infections. How do we get less infections? Probably by limiting unneeded human interactions especially where cases are high. Once infections are lower we can bring back interactions as reasonably as possible.It's really not that complicated.</p>

<p>Instead of looking at the numbers for the whole country, look at them for individual states. They are wildly different. Canada looks much better because we don't have the southern/hot areas, which run on a different "Covid schedule".</p>
<p>Canadian population also has a much lower obesity rate, poverty rate and in turn, nutrition levels are much higher. USA death rate also looks LOTS worse because they lump pneumonia and influenza in with COVID deaths. 200k reported, more like 20k actual.</p>

<p>Plenty of other countries have been able to get down to manageable levels and get back to more normal lives. Yes, flare ups will happen and you have to snuff them out as soon as possible. That's not a arugment against the srategy.</p>
<p>&rt;And a vaccine won't fix it. The flu shot only has an effectiveness of 10% and it has been perfected over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Source? CDC shows 40 - 60%. Yes, a vaccine is the solution. </p>

<p>Pnemumonia is casued by COVID, yes it should be included if they are positive. Normal flu does not normaly kill in the summer at the rates we've seen.</p>

        <p>Would you agree with the illegal Iraq war (which is still going on) and the Patriot Act that resulted in mass surveillance, panic and jingoism which used 9/11 as justification? Do you believe that was the best way of responding to this emergency? Do you think Dick Cheney’s interests in Halliburton had nothing to do with it? Do you imagine that President Trump or his successor(s) wouldn’t do something similar with this crisis?</p>
<p>I’m sure they exist on this sub and others like it but most people here aren’t conspiracy nuts in tin foil hats. I for one believe that the authoritarianism, paranoia and surveillance resulting from this is far more threatening in the long term than the actual disease. </p>
<p>For what it’s worth Steve I’ve upvoted all your comments on this thread. As you say, you were invited to provide a conflicting opinion and you gave one, so your comments deserve to be seen.</p>
<p>EDIT: It was /u/<em>steve_zissou</em> who gave me the gold award. We might never agree with each other but it’s good to know we can still have a discussion. Caricature and name-calling will not make us seem like reasonable adults and will make those on the other side of the debate move away from us more. God knows there’s enough division in the world as it is. I’d recommend saving the piss-taking and mockery for r/coronaviruscirclejerk.</p>

        <p>Possibly, the issue here is that at no point did it say "ask questions". It asked for comments. If you have difficulties reading then the downvotes appear a little harsh, otherwise, as a grown adult take some responsibility for your life. </p>
<p>And no-one asked for some bullshit about why you thought masks were OK, they asked "why do you trust the government?" I hope that clears things up for you. I am sure someone can do a nice drawing that explains this if you are still struggling with the English language once you've read it.</p>

        <p>BECAUSE THE “GOVERNMENT” IS THE AGENCY THAT INSTALLS, MAINTAINS, AND ENFORCES LAWS RELATED TO SIGNAL LIGHTS. “GOVERNMENT” installed the signal lights for our safety. “Government” is the agency that penalizes you for running a red light. </p>
<p>I don’t understand why you all are ok with obeying signal lights, but not ok with wearing masks, when they both serve the same purpose - ensure the safety of other people.</p>

        <p>Your second paragraph is empty. Each new thing that "must be obeyed" creates a new obligation upon citizens above and beyond all the previous things that must be obeyed. Each new that must be obeyed comes with a cost with respect to time, attention, money, and so on. Each new thing that must be obeyed may run afoul of concepts like "human rights" or "freedom of action and thought". It may run afoul of democracy itself, depending on how it is implemented.</p>
<p>Your second paragraph is empty, because it is subject to a reductio ad absurdum such as "I don't understand why you are all ok with obeying signal lights, but why you are not ok with the government assigning you a partner in marriage for life. Like, what the fuck?"</p>
<p>If you cannot engage in debate about the differences between "each new thing" that the government asks of us, on the grounds of <em>that new thing only</em>, then no reasonable discussion can be had.</p>

        <p>Umm... not wishing to be rude given the fact that you seem to be very emotionally volatile (did someone touch you in your special place, today? If so, go find an adult and show them on a dolly where that happened), but I don't obey signal lights.</p>
<p>I don't drive. I am a pedestrian and, occasionally, a cyclist and I freely ignore signal lights and have done all my life. Obeying such lights has nearly gotten me killed, in fact. </p>
<p>I also left the country I grew up in and stopped paying taxes because I don't trust governments to organize a piss up in a brewery and I am certainly not funding their incompetence.</p>
<p>My government has variously managed to pretend homeopathy was medicine and spend billions on quackery, they ran a "5 a day" program for years despite the fact that 5 a day comes from a marketing program and not any kind of scientific research,  and so on. If you think I trust those clowns on masks? I have a lovely bridge for sale in the desert that should be a great opportunity for you. </p>
<p>I am, however, a qualified scientist and I can read scientific papers and I know that masks are worthless according to all current science. So, given that - I shall trust the "science" and the political class which is made up of idiots that can't add up or spell their own names properly. </p>
<p>So, I'll put it to you again, what makes you trust your government when you start thinking, instead of trotting out stupidity?</p>

        <p>It's called burden of proof. If you're claiming there's proof out there, then provide it. Otherwise, don't claim it.</p>
<p>Most of what I see on this sub is complaining about "mask-nazis" and how we suck because we wear "muzzles." If I see anything about proof, it's most likely a Tweet, a YouTube video, or some kind of news article/blog entry.</p>
<p>If you have proof, then provide it, because right now, YOU look like the fucking moron, and a selfish prick at that.</p>
<p>EDIT: But hey, to show I'm not lazy, here's one journal that points to masks being effective: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7253999/</p>
<p>Here's a study from the CDC, suggesting that cloth masks aren't as effective as surgical masks, but not completely eliminating the possibility of their effectiveness: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-0948_article</p>

        <p>The way i see it no safety measure of any kind should ever be mandatory. People should run red lights without a ticket whenever there is no risk and be educated in such a way that they are competent to choose what to do. No mandatory seatbelts, no lifeguards telling people what to do instead of educating people to know what to do etcetc because control and restrictions are adding every year and you dont notice. They treat us as if we are mindless robots that need protection from themselves and  40 years ago when i was a child there was a lot less safety control, i would sit on people lap while they drove and let me steer the wheel yet i survived...those who didnt, well, natural selection is healthy.</p>

        <p>This sub claims to be open minded, yet downvotes people who don't agree with them. I'm not surprised you got downvoted.</p>
<p>You're totally right though, I don't agree with having to obey stop signs, so why am I required to follow them? After all, there's no conclusive proof they stop accidents from happening. Same with seatbelts, we wear them, but there's no proof they stop people from dying in the event of a crash.</p>
<p>That's because neither of them are intended to 100% prevent an accident, or death, just like a mask won't 100% prevent the spread of a disease. But wearing your seatbelt does lower the chances of being flung from your car, just like a mask lowers the chances of catching a disease. If someone says a mask will prevent covid, they're wrong. The mask is not a miracle cure, same as a seatbelt is not a miracle device.</p>
