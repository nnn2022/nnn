    <strong>Toxicologists worries: bol.com removes possibly dangerous masks.</strong>

<p>In brief: these masks contain silver. This is mostly in belgium for mow. Where they had bought 15 million of these masks for their population, but the government is discouraging the use of them. This because researchers have found nanosilver and titan-dioxide that you "can ingest if the mask is washed and it wears down" according to toxicologist Alfred Bernard of the UCLouvain.  </p>
<p>In the Netherlands these masks that contain silver are still for sale everywhere. At least 8 businesses plus <a href="https://Bol.com">Bol.com</a> and Wehkamp sell them, some versions made specifically for children. Acoordint to Professor of Toxicology Paul Borm of Dusseldorf university there has been resaersh into hundreds of product over many years that contain silvers like this and it lets go after only a handful of washes or rinsing. With masks this is especially bad because they can be breathed in. </p>
<p>Even experts who arent entirely convinced that inhaling nanosilvers is harmful still admit that there is no reason why the silvers should even b√© in the masks. </p>
<p>The two biggest businesses have now removed the masks from sale but still claim they were always safe... kinda fishy..</p>
<p>The Netherlands has no specific laws that masks have to meet, they are under a general supply law along with other clothes.</p></p>
