        <p>I'm 27 and have used reddit for probably the last 7-8 years, and I've about had it with this site. I've watched reddit get so awful over the last ~4 years or so, it basically began when they started banning subreddits for wrongthink and were partially bought by a Chinese company. Now (outside of this sub) it just feels like there is a global narrative, and you will be downvoted to hell for saying anything that goes against it in any way. Not to mention the pig-shit awful site redesign, but that's an aesthetic issue.</p>

        <p>I just know the PsyOps guys. I'm not a PsyOp guy myself. I just see how The Army saw social media and immediately saw it as a weapon where stateside we believe social media is this harmless form of personal progression. </p>
<p>That's ultimately my point is to change the narrative from "No the government isn't manipulating social media" to "Yes, the government is doing this abroad but not at home."</p>

        <p>I am not from the army but i definitely saw this. It's interesting on how technology mainly evolved and developed for military reasons, like radio and telecommunications. and we have the best possible technology ever known to modern man, yet what they gave us was a GPS, a camera and a voice recorder. And made it highly addictive to write all of our deepest thoughts and messages in it.</p>

        <p>I've got a few friends who are former SF and they live for PsyOp shit.</p>
<p>One of the towns near me instituted a town wide mask mandate where you could get fined $100 dollars for not wearing a mask.  When it passed, the town assured people that the fines would most likely not happen and only be used as a last resort.  They were also looking for volunteers to act as "public health officers" to enforce the mandate.  My friend, who is against masks, signed on as quickly as he could.  He started writing tickets for the $100 fine to anyone he found not wearing a mask within town limits.  It was only a few weeks before people were angrily complaining to the town about the mandate and they walked it back.</p>

        <p>Not to profile, but the town is a very liberal college town and he is former special forces and still in phenomenal shape, so I don't think anyone is going to kick his ass.  Second, the local cops were like "No, we're not enforcing that." so they had to turn to the public.  Third, his goal was to piss off as many people as possible, getting them to complain to the town and force the town to abandon the mandate.</p>

        <p>Honestly some people act like 12 year olds anyway. Somebody said to me that we "come out of lockdown unscathed" and when I pointed out the horrible effects of the lockdowns they said "reality says otherwise, the lockdown stop anyone from being hurt by the pandemic" and if that's not 12 year old logic I don't know what is. Honestly my 6year old sister is smarter than that...</p>

        <p>It’s dreadful; I’m “attending”university in the UK, there was a Q&amp;A session today on Teams today which I received an email notification for, with <em>no link</em> to the meeting. Cue my family getting all irate because I “failed to get to the meeting” and I “don’t care about my education” Trying to navigate these websites with my mother over my shoulder is like an aneurysm full of AIDS. The longer these lockdowns go on the more likely I am to do something I’d later regret.</p>

        <p>Agreed. People are sick and TIRED of limiting themselves for a virus that is 99.8%+ NON-LETHAL.</p>
<p>It is people over 60 and those with pages of pre-ex's that we need to be worried about. Best thing to do for those people? Give them FULL income replacements until this pandemic is under control and have them STAY THE BLIP HOME!</p>

        <p>Me too. But it's up to us in this community and others like out in the real world to resist at every turn. I used to be scared to go places without a mask because I hate confrontation. But now I say "fuck it" I'm not gonna let the elite take away my rights and turn me into a sheep that asks the government if I can have my rights back. We are individuals but we have to power to change things by acting and encouraging others to act with us.</p>

        <p>This exactly.  I know folks who are in their 30's while still tethered to their parents and have no kids, spewing the same nonsense to stay home and just play video games.  They have no sense of what normal really is.</p>

        <p>In a lot of cultures it is, and it used to be like that here too. The key difference being people worked, paid, and did their fair share around the house as they lived with their parents. I’ve got cousins who are successfully running businesses that still live with parents, as a lot only move out when they get married.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I get that.  And I do think that this bizarre post-war white American habit of picking up and moving 8 states away from your parents is bonkers.  We're both on the same page though, that living like you're 15 when you're 25 is disgusting.</p>
<p>I guess that's just my cultural baggage.  When my Dad turned 18 in 1961 he was expected to leave and he did without complaint.  It was what was expected.  I got the boot at 21, which was 3 years too late according to my Dad, lol.</p>

<p>This. I certainly don't want to live with my parents as a 32yo with a wife and two kids. Nor do I want to live next door to them. We need our space to be our own family, with a separate identity from our parents.</p>
<p>But these people who think it's normal that their kids grow up never even knowing who their grandparents are, because they see them once a year, tops? Yeah, that is not normal in the grand scheme of human history.</p>
<p>We live about 15 minutes from my folks, and 2 hours from my wife's family. That's enough for everyone to have their space, yet still maintain family bonds.</p>

        <p>I am one of those people who grew up 1800 miles from everyone and saw grandparents once or twice a year.  It sucks. Now I live closer to them than my parents and I’ve learned a) they’re basically strangers to me who I don’t really connect with (my family is also very small, between low birth rates and some deaths) and seeing them is not comfortable, and b) I’m now realizing I hate living this far from my parents. I think I had the ‘get away from parents’ attitude when I left in my 20s, but now I see how important and special it is to have family close by. In my experience (saying that bc I know some people have awful bio families and have made a chosen family), friends are great, but they’re just not gonna be there and support you like family does, especially as they pair off and start having kids.</p>

        <p>If I remember correctly, I've read that those who leave home in their late teens or early 20s to go live in an apartment with roommates are actually more likely to move back in with their parents than those who just stay with their parents until their mid 20s when they have a house and spouse lined up. Key thing though: spending those years actually working toward that house and spouse.</p>

It's kinda annoying how many people oppose the "New Normal" but think it'll all blow over soon. We didn't go back to "normal" after 9/11 and we probably won't this time either.

        <p>The vast majority of the people who support lockdowns, masks, and the entire covid narrative are privileged, middle and upper class young urban liberals, and suburban PTA parents with 2.5 kids. They love to virtue-signal and LARP that they're going through a time of worldwide hardship "we're all in this together!". The vast majority of them have well-paying jobs that are paying them to stay in their pajamas in their nice house all day and go on Zoom and Tiktok while getting everything delivered to their door. They exemplify bourgie privilege and have no understanding of how society works...and they frankly just don't even care, it's basically "let them eat cake" for the rest of us going through hell. They think they are making a huge sacrifice for giving up the things they loved to do last year. They love to jack off to how heroic they are for "doing their part". This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to them, their own little WW2 moment, and they have a new-found purpose with their self-righteousness and fake morality.</p>

        <p>Same. I'm extremely introverted, I have social anxiety and anger management issues, I'm probably undiagnosed autistic, my husband and I live with his mother, but I'm arguably one of the more anti-lockdown people on here. I've always been suspicious of the government, corporations, mainstream media, any "public health" or "greater good" bullshit. I was never even on board with "just 2 weeks to flatten the curve" because I have so few people I give a fuck about that I'm statistically unlikely to know someone who dies from COVID or even tests positive. How "hermits" could want authoritarian collectivism is completely beyond me, as lockdowns and other measures to control ~~us~~ the virus are in violation of personal privacy and voluntary association on so many levels. Actual hermits would rather mind their own fucking business in the hopes of other people minding their own fucking business.</p>
<p>If anything, every pro-lockdown person I know is an extraverted Boomer or Gen-Xer who does whatever Daddy Government and Mommy Megacorporation tell them because "it's the law" and they "care about people" and Zoom is this cool newfangled thing everyone is doing nowadays. Most "introverts" on Reddit are those attention-seeking extraverts who say "I'm shy!" while they act all buddy-buddy with total fucking strangers.</p>

        <p>Not only that but there's only 3 days worth of food on average at a grocery store. If everyone tries to do 2 weeks worth of shopping at the same time again there won't be enough for everyone, again. Plus emergency services need to be able to access gasoline for personal and work vehicles, and you can't allow food to rot in the fields, so someone needs to pick, transport, and process it. </p>

        <p>School is all about indoctrination and compliance.  The "one size fits all" model, where 32 children are crammed into a classroom and forced to learn to a certain standard, where some 3rd graders may be reading on the level of a 7th grader and vice-verse, with their being absolutely nothing wrong with either child, is a tragedy and the ultimate example of a blanket attempt at mediocrity and conformity.  What I have seen recently where I work (digital/reference librarian at a somewhat large regional library system) is parents now are actually getting to *see* the crap schools are trying to force down kids throats via Zoom 7 hours a day. They have been coming in basically saying "this is crap. I can do much better as a teacher. I'm unemployed because of lockdowns anyway, so why not."</p>

        <p>I keep thinking about what I would have done if I were still in school now, especially with a very uninvolved single parent. First of all I would have gone crazy not being able to leave my awful home life. Probably would have sent me into mental health treatment a lot sooner... I also would have dropped out and gotten my GED since I could have passed the exam any time after 15. I'm not sure that's a good outcome at all. But one-size-fits-all mediocrity didn't work for me either. I kind of hope the obvious terribleness of zoom school can start a revolution in schooling to better nurture kids' special talents and abilities. Also no one has thus far sufficiently explained to me why school choice is a bad idea... I keep hearing it's racist but not exactly sure how.</p>

<p>Among many early advocates of the open schooling model, which I really admire, was Tolstoy. He had some very insightful things to say about how children learn (and how compulsory schooling crushes their curiosity). Fast-forward about 100 years and Ivan Illich wrote much the same in "Deschooling Society."  Illich would be utterly appalled at the current state of schooling and society in general. He was much like Tolstoy in many ways--a Christian Anarchist who knew the innate goodness of people when not corrupted by the state.</p>

        <p>Never thought I'd say this but I genuinely think I hate this fucking website. I came here as a kid 7-8 years because of some gaming subs, obviously have grown out of them as I got older but I don't remember reddit being like this. In the last few years it has attracted and formed a base of idiots like that one in the picture which don't represent the general population at all and they are fucking everywhere. The smugness, the holier-than-thou attitude and the inability to hold a rational conversation is what defines idiots like these. They are incredibly mentally tiring and I think I will distance myself from this site apart from a few subs in the near future.</p>

        <p>I was having an arguement with a great aunt recently, and I kept trying to get her to understand that while she, a retiree with a good pension and social security who bought her house long before the housing crisis, can lockdown as long as she wants with no problems, the lockdowns are destroying me and my friends. All the responses were basically politely worded versions of "I got mine, fuck you".</p>

        <p>People are so brainwashed by the "we're all in this together" line that they actually don't know how to respond if you simply tell them "No, I don't WANT to be in this together with you."  They're so hyper-socialized (in the Ted K use of the word) that to them this sounds sociopathic.</p>

        <p>I like that response, the "I don't care for you, why should I?" attitude can really confuse some people who think the world revolves around them and theirs.</p>
<p>You can always reverse the shame gun right back at people and ask where they were when X went wrong for you? Or what they did to prevent people losing their jobs, how they helped people with depression etc. Because many who spurt out catchphrases and propaganda never really think beyond surface level and aren't really being honest to their mantras. I've always found that the people who do help others and DO care do so humbly. Oh and if anyone tries to weasel out with staying at home being the most helpful thing they do, then you can applaud their slacktivism and tell them there are shelters that they could volunteer at if they want to put their money where they mouth is.</p>

        <p>Well.  The Boomers, for all everyone shits on them, are the children of the Greatest Generation. They grew up with parents that had been through the Great Depression and WWII.  They grew up with parents who taught them to save money, spend it wisely, and to be self-sufficient, but also to use things up....</p>
<p>Example:  Cut up old towels to make kitchen towels and wash cloths.</p>
<p>How to grow a garden.  How to can the produce for winter food stores.</p>
<p>How to sew and make quilts... </p>
<p>How to change your own erl.</p>
<p>Now here's my theory on why we are where we are in the US specificially.</p>
<p>Most of the Can Do Generation just wanted their kids to have food every day and to not wear hand me downs as much.</p>
<p>Can Do wanted their kids to have 'more' than they had, which is entirely relative.  Hella lot of poor people just wanted their kids to get a HS diploma, have a steady job, and not go hungry.</p>
<p>The Boomers were probably denied a lot of 'fun' toys, but still saw a lucky few get that 2+2 Mustang.  A lucky few had swimming pools.  A lucky few had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Boomers wanted their kids (Gen X) to have all the fun shit they never got to have.  We (I'm Gen X) got to have better cars, a lot more fun, and never went hungry.  We didn't wear hand me downs unless we were hella poor.  We got to have boom boxes and cassettes and later CDs.  We got to bring movies home instead of going to the cinema.  We had a lot more than our parents and surely far far more than our grandparents.  We had HS diplomas and if that fell through, the GED was on offer.  We went to college in droves, got degrees (And watered down the value of a white collar degree in the process) and were on the whole fairly well off.</p>
<p>Here's where it goes off the rails.</p>
<p>SOME of the Gen Xers can't give up their HS and college years.  They get married, have kids, and graft themselves into the lives of their children, thus begins the age of Soccer Moms and Dads.  They have every child they have involved in so much shit (Piano, dance, soccer, story time at the library, etc) they are never home (because those McMansions are just for show, they aren't really 'homes').  Teen pregnancy is on the rise, despite free access to birth control at every health department, because 'Who needs two people to raise kids when women can do it all!?'.  The home as a safe place is instead a display area to show how well off we are, a giant window display.  Helicopter parents can't let their kids be kids and have their lives and grow past them - the parents have no other lives, so they have to cling to their children's lives and friends and the parents of those friends.</p>
<p>Usher in the Millennials. Their parents do everything for them, they make doctor appointments, they call attorneys when their adult kid gets a ticket for being a dipshit on the road.  They keep their kids on their cell phone bill, their health insurance, and keep them living in their homes.  They do their laundry for them, cook, bring in takeout, whatever.  They raise the children of their children so their children can continue to have a 'normal' life which means party and leave mom and dad to raise the kid.</p>
<p>NOW the Can Do generation is dying off.  The Boomers are stigmatized as the ONES WHO RUINED THE WORLD (Because they wanted their kids to have it better than they did, I guess? Thus facilitating the comfortable lifestyle the millennials have now).</p>
<p>And it's trickling down into the Zoomers.</p>
<p>THIS is what happens when enough people don't have enough to do with their time.  When Mazlow's Heirachy of Needs is met.  You get generations of pussies who like to LARP, thinking they're doing something meaningful with their lives.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it has something to do with where I live, but maybe 1 out of 5 Boomers know how to garden, sew, or change their oil. That's a Millennial/Zoomer thing here. Boomers (and Gen-Xers) are the "just buy it!" "just pay someone else to do it!" generation. They also tend to hoard perishable food that molds and rots before it gets eaten, but go "huh?" when you suggest stocking up on water and non-perishable food.</p>

        <p>I agree. I’d say the boomers tend to be outspoken about their beliefs but when it comes to people with real skills, the very old (silent and what’s left of the greatest generation) and the relatively young (millennials) tend to be the ones interested in gardening and outdoor stuff. You see a lot of 20-somethings into canning and making your own <strong><em>_</em></strong>. Some of it is hipster BS but who cares if the guy making your deer sausage has a hand tattoo and a “cool” beard, fact is that guy has skills.</p>

        <p>It's very much a state of psychological warfare.  IMO, the lockdowns exist to force people online so that they must be exposed to the warfare.  They must either soak up the conditioning or, if they're resisters, make themselves known so they can be tagged as potential problems.</p>

        <p>Most of the 70+ people go "Why don't we just have the people my age stay home and let the rest of society do their thing?" when I talk with them.</p>
<p>They understand that this virus is uncommonly lethal to people over 60 for some reason however they do not think that we should shut down society simply to protect them.</p>
<p>Just give people over 60 a full income replacement that is enough to actually LIVE AND THRIVE ON until this pandemic is over. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Same thing for people with pages of pre-ex's, who are the majority of the people dying under 60.</p>

        <p>I would think there is a split same as elsewhere If not more. There's a group that also thinks "I didn't work all those years just to not be able to do what I want in retirement, or see my family." My grandfather is one of those.  even back in June he was even less worried about the virus than I am and he is a retired doctor (an eye doctor mind you).</p>

        <p>To be fair I don't really like being around most people (because I knew they were all dumb sheep even before all this) and I'm quite an introvert.</p>
<p>I spend most evenings by myself and only break that rule when I decide to have a woman over. </p>
<p>That being said I understand what human dignity is. I understand how societies move towards authoritarianism and I don't want to see outgoing kids suffer because of scared busybodies making rules. </p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is I don't go out much but I would fight to the death for the right to be able to do so. Just because I'm a broken introvert, doesn't mean I don't hope the world will be a better place that doesn't produce people like me in the future.</p>

        <p>"Introvert" and "anti-social" aren't interchangeable. There is nothing wrong with introversion. It's nothing more than how you're energized vs what drains you.</p>
<p>The people who want everyone to live as hermits like they do are antisocial, not introverted.</p>

        <p>You aren't "broken" at all. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert. This year proved beyond any doubt what most people are like...to subject yourself to their vapid company is tiresome and stress-inducing. But these people are NOT introverts. Some of them are just completely socially inept, like the nerd stereotype taken to the extreme...that's not being introverted, that's just a complete lack of any sort of social skill. But most of them aren't even that. They have good-paying jobs, they live in nice suburban houses, they're either single young urbanites with techie jobs or suburban PTA/soccer moms and dads. They used to love going to restaurants, bars, clubs, the movies, sporting events, etc etc. They used to love taking their kids to their basketball games and wine parties, and having backyard cookouts. But you see...this year they are doing this because they feel like they are making sacrifices to "save the world from an evil horrible plague".  I've spoken about this here before numerous times. These people are typically middle class and upper middle class with jobs that are paying them their full or most of their salaries while they sit at home watching Netflix. They are privileged, sanctimonious pieces of shit who want to feel like they are going through a big worldwide event, like WW2. This whole fiasco gives meaning and purpose to their superficial lives. They want to feel like heroes and saviors. So don't disparage yourself...there's nothing wrong with you. The world would actually be a better place and we wouldn't be in this mess if we had more free thinkers like you.</p>

        <p>One of the Angry Whitehouse Staffer Twitter pages just started pushing a 6-8 week lockdown.  I didn’t reply out of self preservation but the number of replies from people who have no idea where their food comes from and who cares for their elderly is astronomical. </p>
<p>Counties that had successful lockdowns did in early and more importantly had functioning social safety nets. We do not. Even if the lockdown could work, it couldn’t work here. This should not even be in discussion.</p>

        <p>I think a real lockdown is possible. But the second you tell those people your Amazon orders will be delayed for a few weeks they’ll have a conniption. If we could close grocery stores, hospitals and other critical infrastructure for three weeks we’d be rid of the virus but no one wants to do that.</p>

        <p>The media will never put these numbers into context, because then they would look less scary, and the people would ask " Why are we doing all this?". How many people die in the US, on average, every day before Corona? How many people will die this flu season, from the flu that isn't Corona? Yes, those x-rays of destroyed lungs are impressive, but how many people have gotten pneumonia and died from it before Corona? How busy were our emergency rooms, on average, before Corona?</p>

        <p>My genius governor DeWine said that if “current trends continue” we’re gonna lockdown again in like a week. If the lockdowns were really about protecting people’s lives there wouldn’t be any language like that. He’s basically saying “yea Ohio your lives don’t matter unless you make our numbers look bad.” Idk why stuff like that wouldn’t infuriate the pro-lockdown folk just as much as we do. Honestly if they put more restrictions on, if anything it’ll make me less likely to follow this bullshit.</p>

        <p>I mean, that’s because the US is one of the only countries that creates a lockdown, and doesn’t give money to the businesses and employees to cover the shutdown costs. That’s so stupid, it’s a guarantee for bankruptcies.</p>
<p>Although, deaths are also permanent. If the hospitals are full, and way more people need hospitalization because of COVID, then there is available, then people will be permanently dead.</p>

        <p>Where do you want the money to come from? We’re many trillions in debt and the lockdowns have exacerbated that problem while cutting tax revenue. It’s all well and good t say, “give people money” but at some point somebody actually has to foot the bill. And before you say “tax rich people more” realize this, the first coronavirus bills cost considerably more than half of the combined net worth of the Forbes 400 ($2.59 trillion vs $3.2 trillion). If we pass another bill 1/2 as large, we’ll have spent the combined net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans and remember, as you go down the scale the amounts you can take get smaller. Obviously, nobody is suggesting seizing all of anyone’s wealth, but even aggressive taxation has a point of diminishing returns.</p>

        <p>A better idea is to not have lockdowns. Adults can evaluate their own willingness to take risks. If you’re too scared to open your business and I’m not, I might make a lot of money and I might get sick. You might go bankrupt but you wind get sick. That’s life.</p>

        <p>If there’s no lockdown there’s no reason to be out of work and there’s no livelihood destroyed. End the lockdowns, support small businesses with loans like you’ve been doing, and there will be no shortage of employment. We’ve already gotten most people fired back to work.</p>

<p>Unemployment right now is exactly where it was November of 2013. If that wasn’t a massive crisis in need of gigantic government intervention, this isn’t either. Since the only reason people are getting fired is the states shutting down businesses, don’t do that and we’ll be fine.  </p>

        <p>No offense, but the definition of marginally attached is so broad as to include basically every lazy jerk off who’s smart enough to pretend they want to go to a job interview once a year. </p>
<p>Even then, we were at 6.9 October of last year which is about as low as it’s ever going to get. Spiked up to 18 and are now down to 12. Meaning that about half the people who lost their jobs already have them back. And the trend is moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>You see the same trend regardless of which measure you use. Spike in summer and since then 1/2 or more of those people have found employment again. </p>
<p>Check out page 27. Here https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_12062013.pdf</p>
<p>November 2013, U-6 rate was 13.2 seasonally adjusted, 12.7 not adjusted.</p>
<p>Compare that to current.</p>
<p>https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm </p>
<p>Once again, if November 2013 wasn’t a crisis crying out for massive government spending, this isn’t either. The fact that 5 years after 2013 we had a booming economy would tend to suggest that it wasn’t.</p>

        <p>I don't know where you are getting that idea but as someone who has utilized both platforms as well as several other well known "gig work" platforms at times as a source of extra income and at others as an easy way to make money in between jobs and now as a full time source of income I can assure you if you are persistent and take the time to figure out how best to plan your time and trips in relation to the unique patterns in your city it is very possible to make om average 15 to 18 dollars an hour. Factor in the ability to schedule my day around my kids schedules and any other side hustles I have going on and that wage is even higher...just the close to a thousand dollars a month I am now able to save not having to pay for childcare puts my typical monthly bring home pay around $3000! Success or failure in the gig economy depends on the individuals level of commitment and hustle so it's not for everyone but let's not hate on one of the few low barrier of entry sources of decent income still available to the average person. </p>
<p>P.s. that is not to say that these platforms do not have their drawbacks and issues by any means just that they are not the exploitive slave labor robber barons that some on the left would like us to believe they are (individuals and groups with a vested interest in controlling access to employment opportunities and thus the fees and votes of made dependent on their protection and political power)...I agree that if there is money to prop up irresponsible banks and maintain troops across the globe to protect the interests and security of corporation's and other nations then there is money to help hard working Americans who lost their livelihoods due to overzealous fear based acts of tyranny!</p>
