    <strong>Censoring my posts huh?</strong>
    <p><p>Scared of someone that isn't a part of your hivemind? For people who claim to be independent and outside of the norm, it's ironic that you've created your own little safe space where you feel the need to censor dissent. What, don't like your shaky beliefs being questioned?</p></p>

        <p>When Donald Trump isn't enough of a populist for you, it should be a sign that you've gone off the deep end. Let me ask you this: do you believe that China, the most ruthless economic machine in the entire world, would shut down their economy for no reason? </p>
<p>I'm going to put my mask on, over my nose, every time I leave my house. You won't, because you don't care about hurting others. Either that, or you've convinced yourself into you're doing it for freedom. Honestly, I don't care why you have the beliefs that you have if they lead to other people getting sick. </p>
<p>You can try to persuade me to empathize with you, but after about three hours trying to talk to you people, I doubt you have much more substance to provide aside from surface level insults and easily rebuked "fans".</p>

<p>Anyone who still defends lockdowns is sick. </p>
<p>Luckily the face diapers your cult wears are not as destructive as your lockdowns. Just utterly pointless as we can clearly see they haven’t stopped anything.</p>

        <p>Dude, you are dense as fuck. America never went into a full preventative lockdown. I work at a grocery store, and tons of people don't wear masks. <em>That is not a lockdown</em>. </p>
<p>I said this in another comment, but I'll just repeat myself: the people in this sub are a direct representation of why we are continuing to have COVID-19 related economic problems. You don't wear your fucking mask, you don't socially distance, you don't take any precautions at all, and you're wondering why this virus keeps spreading? Get the fuck out of here. You're just going to cause another economic shutdown, and that's what happening right now. </p>
<p>Also, I find it funny that as soon as I acknowledge one of your arguments, you go into a manic, crazy rant that has zero fact based arguments. You need to reevaluate the way you see the world, because as of now, I think you have a weak grasp on reality. </p>
<p>Nice link by the way. No shit shutdowns are bad. Why do you think everyone is having a miserable year? If you don't want shutdowns, be fucking safe so we don't have to have another one.</p>

        <p>As a consistent and harsh critic of our government for many years, before Trump, I laugh at the idea that I don't ask questions. You, me, and everyone else should be critical and skeptical of what our government does, and why it does it. We should all be on the lookout for power grabs, for shifts towards an autocracy, for the stripping of civil liberties. Like the Patriot Act, like Citizens United, like the bomb strikes during the Obama administration, like the ignoring of the Enoluments Clause during the Trump Administration.</p>
<p>But that's not what's happening here. This is a literal pandemic, and you're just grasping at straws. You have zero proof to support that this is a shift towards authoritarianism, or even tighter post COVID-19 regulations. The government is losing money and resources, and the economy has never been more unpredictable. What is to be gained by telling people to follow safety regulations?</p>

        <p>The WHO position you are referring to was mentioned by a spokesperson, David Nabbaro, who was taken out of context. That same person, in the 20 minute interview, said “We’re saying we really do have to learn how to coexist with this virus in a way that doesn’t require constant closing down of economies, but at the same time in a way that is not associated with high levels of suffering and death." He also states that the U.S. was never in a lockdown, so it didn't even make steps towards readjusting society to be more safe. </p>
<p>The WHO official position is that shutdowns are for redistributing resources, techniques, and practices to our everyday life that will make it safe for reopening. As of now, our society <em>is not safe for reopening</em>. In this way, the WHO position is consistent that we should be in a lockdown right now. The original statement by Nabbaro says “We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources; protect your health workers who are exhausted. But by and large, we’d rather not do it.” He's saying that once your country has made its adjustments, lockdowns should not be seen as a solution. </p>
<p>If anybody here would actually take the time to do research, they would see how often they're taking things out of context and applying them. In other words, do your research next time.</p>

        <p>You took your time about it, but you effectively just made my point for me. This bit:</p>
<p><em>We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus</em></p>
<p>is <em>exactly</em> what I was referring to. Lockdowns are being used as a primary method of control - in fact, the only method of control - and the WHO disagrees with that. Claiming 'the US was never in a lockdown' is just a lie: tens of millions are confined to home or work right this very second.</p>

        <p>You literally just quoted the original, out of context quote. How are you this dense? Did you read my entire comment, or are you taking that out of context as well? </p>
<p>I literally copy and pasted this from the first article I could find on the matter:</p>
<p><em>We checked with Nabarro to find out if the clip accurately reflected the points he raised during a nearly 20-minute interview. He responded, by email: “My comments were taken totally out of context. The WHO position is consistent.”</em></p>
<p><em>That context Nabarro mentioned covered a range of topics, such as the estimate that about 90% of the world’s population is still vulnerable to COVID-19, that lockdowns are only an effective pandemic response in extreme circumstances and what Nabarro means when he talks about finding the</em> <a href="https://www.4sd.info/covid-19-narratives/reflections-about-the-middle-path/"><em>“middle path.”</em></a></p>
<p><em>“We’re saying we really do have to learn how to coexist with this virus in a way that doesn’t require constant closing down of economies, but at the same time in a way that is not associated with high levels of suffering and death,” Nabarro said in the interview.</em></p>
<p>As of now, America is not coexisting with the virus in a safe way. WHO is simply stating that opening and closing economies is bad for everyone, and so we should make the proper precautions to avoid it. Which we haven't done. Because of people like you. And so here we are, wasting time shutting down the economy and laying people off, only to waste our time and wait for another resurgence to shut down the economy again. You and your representatives are the reason why we don't have proper safety infrastructure to avoid another shutdown. </p>
<p>Also, I call bullshit. I live in one of the most liberal cities in the country, and people still go into stores without masks and nobody cares. If you think this is a true lockdown because people have lost their jobs, you should consider the fact that during Italy's spike you were required to provide documentation stating where you were going. <em>That</em> is a lockdown. In several states, masks aren't even required. Thats not a lockdown.</p>

        <p>Your 'context' contains two direct, crystal-clear statements: "lockdowns only effective in extreme circumstances," and "lockdowns should not be primary method of control." I completely agree.</p>
<p>The problem is: we aren't in an extreme situation (more fool you for assuming everyone is American...). Lockdowns have been used as the primary method of control for nearly a year, <em>contrary to the WHO's clarified position</em>, ruining tens of millions of lives and causing several million unnecessary deaths.</p>
<p>How would you define a 'person like me,' exactly? What image do you have in your head?</p>

        <p>You're right; WHO directly states that lockdowns are bad for everyone, and disproportionally effect people who are already poor, sick, or weak. They should be avoided until there is no other option. However, WHO also says, in literally the exact same page, "Governments must make the most of the extra time granted by ‘lockdown’ measures by doing all they can to build their capacities to detect, isolate, test and care for all cases; trace and quarantine all contacts; engage, empower and enable populations to drive the societal response and more." America, and many other countries around the world, have not traced cases, have not empowered populations to drive societal response, and have not tested and cared for cases. So they are in an extreme situation. As is evident by the cases going up. And the deaths. If countries wanted to control lockdown states, then they need to establish the proper infrastructure, which they have not been doing. And so people resume life, there is another spike, and then we have to go into shutdown again. They are not learning from their mistakes, and we are paying for it through shutdowns. </p>
<p>I don't particularly care whether or not you're American. You are propagating an ideology that is encouraging people to spread a disease in my country and others around the world. Perhaps your country is smaller, and so you contained it easier. Perhaps it's more organized, so your government could contact trace better. I don't care. What I do care about is that your ideology is spreading like a cancer throughout the world, and poisoning people into thinking that this virus is not a big deal. That's what kind of person I think you are. Someone who is actively promoting death and sickness through disinformation.</p>

        <p>What did you say? Or how did you phrase it? Based on how you’ve responded in the comments I’d imagine you may have been looking for a self fulfilling prophecy. </p>
<p>I’ve had plenty of conversations on plenty of topics where folks disagree with me. I’ve found that if I keep it cordial that each of us come away with at least a better understanding of the other persons stance.</p>

        <p>I agree with you, we should be communicating to each other, especially right now. I think the few other comments I've posted in this thread are a good representation of the way I'm conducting myself. I'm being harsh in a way, but I've received way more insults than I'm giving.</p>
<p>Coupled with the fact that I think this sub is propagating actions that lead to premature death, I hardly think I'm being crude by calling someone selfish. Which is what I've been doing.</p>

        <p>You've started the insults 100% of the time, calling me dense and someone else a walking time bomb who is 'off the deep end.'</p>
<p>How about we call <em>you</em> selfish, for placing your own protection above the two million people who will die from not getting TB jabs this year - thanks to the lockdown? How about we call <em>you</em> selfish, for thinking millions of people should be out of work and grow up poor to reduce <em>your</em> incredibly small risk of death from one contagious illness out of many? How about we call <em>you</em> selfish, for thinking your need to feel 'safe' (pro-tip: no-one is ever safe) outweighs the need of people with severe mental illness to access therapy?</p>

        <p>Yeah, you're right, I actually walk back my claim that I haven't started the insults. You <em>are</em> dense, and you <em>are</em> off the deep end. Why else would you be in a fringe, alt-right subreddit that's going to be banned in a week? Do you feel emboldened by having such frowned upon views?</p>
<p>Logic tells us one thing: the longer dumbasses like you don't follow safety regulations, the longer we're going to be in this mess. You don't want people to die from a lack of access to medical care? Then perhaps you should focus on our hospitals not getting overrun with COVID-19 patients. Why the fuck do you think there's no nurses right now? They're terrified of getting this virus, or their busy helping those that are infected. But yeah, keep telling yourself that you know more than the WHO and the entire scientific community. I'm sure it's pretty validating.</p>
