    <strong>Top 5 reasons to not take the Covid vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Here are my top 5 reasons not to take it, from number 5 to number 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(5) The vaccine is pushed so hard in the media - When a vaccine is pushed this hard in the media, it's probably the best idea not to take it, especially when it's free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(4) The vaccine manufacturers are immune to any and all liability in the event of an adverse effect, regardless of severity - Why would you have something injected into you without any liability from the creators? That would be like not being able to sue a restaurant if you were to get food poisoning after eating there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(3) The vaccine is experimental and still in trials - Anyone who takes the vaccine is essentially a human guinea pig. Any long-term effects it may have are completely unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2) There's been several deaths and other adverse effects from the vaccine - More so than every other vaccine within the past 20 years, going by the reported cases. This includes blood clots, fertility issues and death. Keep in mind that only a fraction of adverse effects from vaccines are reported to VAERS in the first place. Sadly, most of the general public is unaware of these problems the vaccine is causing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(1) It doesn't completely stop infection or transmission - Even if you're fully vaccinated, it is still very possible to catch Covid and spread it to others, rendering the already weak "take the vaccine for other people" argument moot. This is why it's advised you still wear a mask after being vaccinated. Originally, this was going to be reason number 5, but then I remembered since the vaccine doesn't completely stop infection or transmission, this could cause the virus to mutate into more powerful variants, bumping this right up to number 1. This is exactly what happened with the vaccine for the Marek's disease, as that didn't completely stop infection or transmission either. As such, people taking the vaccine may only help prolong the pandemic, rather than end it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, there you go. There's my top 5 reasons to avoid the Covid vaccine. Do you guys agree with these top 5 reasons, and the order they are in?</p></p>

        <p>Yes, this is a correct statement. But what stupid people don't realize is it isn't actually free. Our tax dollars paid to develop this miraculous, fastest ever developed vaccine, and our tax dollars pay to produce, advertise, and administer it. But yeah, it's free! Hurry! Go get it for free!</p>
<p>Big Pharma is currently at an all you can eat buffet if money was food.</p>

        <p>Don’t forget there have been more deaths by the reaction of this vaccine than any compared from around the 1950’s until now. No vaccine has killed more people than this one. Let that sink in.</p>

        <p>YES, you are ENTIRELY correct, but the population today compared to 1955 is almost 3 times as much and so far more people have received the covid vaccine compared to smallpox ALONE</p>

        <p>I have 2 fundamental reasons not often see them discussed for mainstream vaccines</p>
<p>1) Substances that cannot be independently evaluated in any way. Vaccines do fall in this category because they are monopolized secret serums. Any paper brought in as a proof to anything around vaccines, cannot be independently analyzed, it cannot be independently tested, it cannot be independently verified, these drugs cannot be traded in the open market since 1906. And that is a big red flag.  So anyone who claims he did vaccine research and he knows, he must have access to those drug substances by principle. Which is limited to a pharma-gov cartel. </p>
<p>2) Mandates. Something useful for the society, needs no mandates. Critical elements for life, like water for example need no mandate.  Because it's an element that works for the recipient 100% and without it, well your are SOL. On the other hand, vaccines are mandated therefore automatically they can't be possibly beneficial for the user, by definition.</p>
<p>As a side note I would mention these drugs are called "safe &amp; effective". Ordering terms in that sequence, is yet another red flag. When I shop around for something I will use, I search for what I need primarily. I don't search for the term "safe" because there are many "safe" products which are completely useless to what I need. Even this marketing "safe &amp; effective" title defies common sense. It's nonsense.</p>

        <p>Well it is a law, just showed you the airline industry as an basic example. Government funds and bails out the airline industry financially who in turn impose mandates essentially using taxed money. Can't be more clear than this. And of course there wouldn't be a reference to "Vaccine passports" ever if there wasn't a mandate. So you can't access basic necessities in life without being drugged.</p>

<p>&rt; safe vaccines out there </p>
<p>Most useless for me things, are "safe". Did you even read my comment?</p>
<p>How do you know what vaccines are safe the moment there is no independent vaccine access? Do you work for big pharma? </p>
<p>Or you are just a believer? Can you clarify?</p>

        <p>I can look out into the world know that every public school student in my country has received the required immunizations and they are all fine I can look at the death statistics and I see the infant mortality/child mortality is very low that's enough to make a heuristic to say that they're safe. Non-industry researchers look at the results of vaccinations all the time.</p>
<p>I don't think the vaccine mandate for flight will continue forever, just for a little while. Regardless of whether governments have bailed them out they are private companies and are not required to admit anyone they don't want to. I'm not happy about vaccine passports I don't think they should exist, but not being able to fly out of your country into another is not violating any of your rights.</p>

<p>That's because living conditions improved. If it was to trust the pharma-gov cartel we'd be extinct, historically proven....</p>

<p>For flight? How about travel or work does that count? </p>

<p>&rt;governments have bailed them out they are private companies </p>
<p>No if a government funds a company, that company is no longer private, by definition.</p>

        <p>Haha I'm pretty familiar with human rights. Be honest, do you think you have a human right to enter any country in which you are not a citizen?</p>
<p>I think it's very hard (read impossible) to argue that we would have eradicated polio or smallpox without a vaccine. The point of vaccinations is to make it harder for diseases to spread by making it harder to become infected, then conditional on having been infected speed convalescence and reduce transmission. So spare me the 5g conspiracy b.s.. you do not have first-hand knowledge of everything you think to be true either. If it were to be demonstrated that vaccines are unsafe and the risks are not outweighed by the protection they offer I would change my mind. Could you say the same if the reverse were true?</p>

<p>Which makes leaky vaccines a real issue. See the vaccine derived version of polio for instance.

        <p>These 'vaccines' only prevent severe Covid among the weakest and unhealthiest people, they don't even fully succeed in that either (only %66 and %90).</p>
<p>Unlike traditional vaccines, they don't immunize you so transmission/infection rates are <em>NOT</em> affected at all.</p>
<p>Notice how countries suddenly started reporting more 'cases' once they started their vaccination campaigns?</p>

        <p>C'mon, man. This is akin to saying there is no evidence the common cold exists.</p>

<p>We know there is a virus. But we also recognize that it's been overblown, most of the measures are unlikely to prevent the spread, and it is bizarre that people are not worrying about mitigating the effects anywhere near as much as they are trying to avoid it (which is comical).</p>

        <p>I suggest you do some research my friend. No virus has ever been isolated, purified and then put in something to make it sick. I'll point you to Stefan Lanka, Andrew Kaufman and Tom Cowan. These 3 are the founders and pioneers of the information that will both change our lives and also make us doubt everything we've ever been taught.</p>

        <p>I'm not disputing that.</p>
<p>However, if the claims that the virus doesn't exist start being repeated here often enough, the sub will be banned. Never isolating the virus doesn't mean that it's not real, but again, I don't think this conversation will lead to any positive outcomes for anyone.</p>

        <p>So even if its true don't mention it? So accept that this is happening without proof? Surely that goes against everything this sub stands for?</p>

        <p>There is a stark difference between claiming:</p>
<ul>
<li>The evidence of mask mandate efficacy is weak;</li>
<li>The evidence supporting the efficacy of lockdowns is weak;</li>
<li>There is a high number of false positives</li>
<li>Most people dying are obese and deficient in vitamin D</li>
</ul>
<p>...and suggesting the virus isn't real.</p>
<p>It may or may not be true, but it is a paradigm shift orders of magnitude larger than most people could possibly accept IF it is true. Look at all the basic things that many are unable to admit are contradictory and illogical.</p>
<p>I am here because I am unhappy with the measures that have been taken against this whole 'crisis'. But I don't think the merits of the idea of the virus not being real are going to help here. We have so much evidence to support everything else without sounding like crazy conspiracy theorists, and I feel like this particular aspect is just a little too far out there, that it will be used as the primary narrative when people are rallying the troops against this sub.</p>

        <p>I completely understand your point but I also completely disagree. Why should we settle for defeating this tyranny a step at a time if there is one thing that debunks all of it? Just so we don't get called quacks? 
I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I've never had much interest in conspiracies before this shit show. I fell for it for the first week or 2 then realised something wasn't right. I've spent the best part of 14 months looking into this and no I'm not a virologist, I don't have letters after my name but I'm well educated and literate. 
The virus myth is a huge thing to get your head around, I struggled for a while to comprehend that everything we have been told from a very young age until now is wrong but I genuinely can't see any other alternative. 
I'm not trying to get the upper hand in a debate, I'm not even trying to win you over, I'm just hoping that someone might be reading and look into this to gain more insight. 
Again, look at Andrew Kaufman, Tom Cowan and Stefan Lanka. Also look at German New Medicine, it is our future.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly. Flooding people with so much information is overwhelming.</p>
<p>&rt;The virus myth is a huge thing to get your head around, I struggled for a while to comprehend that everything we have been told from a very young age until now is wrong but I genuinely can't see any other alternative.</p>
<p>Even for someone like me who has been pushing back since very early on, largely because I had covid prior to the world falling into a state of emergency, this is a huge rabbit hole to go down.</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's not true, but I would wager that most people on here who are against these measures would have a hard time even entertaining the idea that the virus is 'fake'. If you can't even convince the people who are largely on your side, what hope could you possibly have to convince those who think a mask will protect them?</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not trying to get the upper hand in a debate, I'm not even trying to win you over, I'm just hoping that someone might be reading and look into this to gain more insight. Again, look at Andrew Kaufman, Tom Cowan and Stefan Lanka. Also look at German New Medicine, it is our future.</p>
<p>Neither am I. I'm not saying you're wrong or that people shouldn't at least consider the possibility, either. I encourage people to question everything. I just think that, on the face of it, from your perspective, people need to know this. But from the perspective of many of us skeptics, this may be more detrimental than it is helpful because it is an extraordinary claim.</p>
<p>Something as rudimentary as understanding that governments largely don't have peoples best interests at heart is too much for people to handle. Imagine something on this scale? True or not, most people could not handle this kind of thing even if it is entirely accurate. But because it is such a bold claim, it would be the first thing used to take subs like this down.</p>
<p>That I can promise you with a high degree of confidence.</p>

        <p>Appreciate the reply mate. I get you I honestly do. You think that this will end up labelling us as crazy rather than having legitimate arguments against things that are obviously wrong. 
I also know that even hardened conspiracy theorists won't think this is a possibility, however, what do we do? If it is true, and I have no doubt in my mind it is, do we keep it under wraps? 
Glad we can have a civil conversation rather than bickering. Although I do feel we will probably have to agree to disagree on this! 
Peace brother.</p>

<p>We keep pointing out the <em>obvious</em> until that becomes accepted, and then we move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>Throughout history, it is often the minority that gets ostracized for not following the herd. Sometimes they are wrong, but more often than not we know how history rhymes.</p>
<p>What I would suggest is speaking with those around you, asking them questions and doing your best to educate them. You may learn something from them. One thing I do know is that getting authentic information is getting harder and harder, and there is a lot of bullshit out there. From the MSM and from skeptics and conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, I think that most of this stems from the control over the monetary system. You can make people do almost anything if you threaten their financial stability and reputation. 'Experts' are easy to buy off if they are "just doing their jobs". You know, the same excuse used in the 40s.</p>
<p>They have taken advantage of this situation and perpetrated the largest wealth transfer in history, so from my perspective, we win the fight by defunding them and moving to a decentralized currency. If we can eliminate their source of corruption and power, we can have a chance at building a better world for everyone.</p>

        <p>Where's the proof? They haven't isolated and purified it (contrary to what fact checkers say) and it has no distinguishing symptoms from any other respiratory illness?

        <p>He's right though. The book you want to read on this is called  "Virus Mania". Whatever the Bubonic Plague was doesn't compare to modern "epidemics". Covid-19 (the virus) not existing is just tip of the iceberg stuff. There are a LOT of so-called viruses that have caused so-called "epidemics" in the last ~100 years where no evidence exists for the theory that the disease was caused by a virus.  Spanish flu, Polio, BSE and HIV/AIDS to name a few.</p>

        <p>Yea, you do. Covid 19 has not been isolated by Koch's postulates, not even close. The CDC is saying that's it's been 'isolated' according to new criteria that they have determined themselves. Lol. Science.</p>

        <p>Good list. Another one is that some countries are making longer-term deals for once or twice a year “booster drugs” so it’s just a source of revenue for drug companies and part of the “new normal.” I would move #2 to #1 only because there have been 157,244 adverse reaction reports, mostly reported by medical personnel, at ~1% reporting rate.</p>

(3) same with every other vaccine?

        <p>It's a sub for pushing back against all the 'new normal' things that are happening. There's a great deal of concern about how the drug approvals process was circumvented for this pandemic. The sub isn't anti vax, but there's a large number here that are anti this vax. Of course all the anti vaxers get drawn here from across Reddit.</p>
<p>Moderna has <em>never</em> had a drug approved in the entire history of the company. </p>
<p>As for me I get my first shot on Friday - stoked. But I'm super troubled by how quick my government was to seize power, deny freedoms and spend like money was no object.</p>

        <p>Find me a sub with no idiots. Yeah there's a higher concentration here than other places, but I'd much rather be here than somewhere more sinister like sino.</p>
<p>I don't actually know what to think of people who are happy to have their rights taken away. Like I get it, you're scared, but you have agency and can control the people you spend time with and what you do. So many positions that people have taken have been revealed to just be naked and unprincipled. </p>
<p>I don't know how one can, in principle, be pro-choice and pro vaccine mandate.</p>
<p>I don't know how one can, in principle support free the nipple and outdoor mask mandates.</p>
<p>I don't know how one can, in principle, be for BLM protests, but against mask-mandate protests. </p>

<p>Well, you just said it yourself....</p>
<p>&rt;I don't actually know what to think of people who are happy to have their rights taken away</p>
<p>"Have their rights taken away" - what contradicts rights taken away? And it is  to save many more's rights? By having yours "taken" away, you are saving many other's rights for life. If you disagree with that, that is just plain selfish because the government cant just let a specific group of people feeling like this is not fair to them have the rule exempt for them.</p>
<p>&rt;I don't know how one can, in principle, be pro-choice and pro vaccine mandate.</p>

<p>No idea where you live but outdoor masks sounds crazy.</p>

        <p>"what contradicts rights taken away" I'm sorry I don't understand what you're asking.</p>
<p>That whole paragraph about rights is just nuts. I mean it's fine to be a utilitarian, but then don't pretend to believe in rights. It's not like if I have a right to free expression and you have the right to free expression than there is twice as many rights to free expression as if only one of us has it. A right either exists and is recognized or doesn't.</p>
<p>Pro choice is, in principle the recognition that women should have the right to decide what happens to their body even if this abrogates the very life of the fetus. How you reconcile that with forcing people to undergo a medical prophylactic treatment which might prevent exposing someone to a virus is beyond me and if there's a principled argument that reconciles those two positions I have yet to see it articulated.</p>
<p>I do live in a place where some regions (not mine thankfully) do have outdoor mask mandates. A man was also recently murdered because he wasn't wearing a mask outdoors. I'm glad you are against this lunacy.</p>
<p>Freedom of assembly has been heavily restricted. This was mysteriously not an issue when thousands of people gathered to protest in favour of the BLM movement, but other protests (particularly anti-mask) have been dealt with much more violently. I see no principled argument that can support this behaviour.</p>
<p>Yes I do think it's mostly politicians. Gavin Newsom dining indoors maskless with high ranking members of the medical establishment is one. I don't think you know enough about me to make that assertion, but I'm used to being assumed to be in bad faith because I'm subbed here, so no worries.</p>

<p>Wow, so what you are basically saying (if your logic works in place and just setting an example) is that if a serial killer is arrested they should still have their rights and be released since the logic does not make sense that they should have all their rights?</p>
<p>Since when is it 'forced'?</p>

        <p>I'm not saying there are current laws that force people to have the vaccine (although the talk of passports comes very close), but there are a shitload of people who want there to be a mandate or a total exclusion from society for anyone not vaccinated.</p>
<p>It's very much germane when the government will give freedoms to people to protest thing that the government approves of them protesting and denying others under the auspices of the virus.</p>

        <p>No you slipped back into utilitarian thinking. If there is such thing as a right it does not get restricted except when you violate the rights of others. If you think you have a right to something that can be taken and given by the government when it's convenient without you having done anything to deserve it then that's not a right.</p>
<p>I don't think it's moral to have a society where there are no human rights and everything is subject to whether or not it benefits society.</p>
