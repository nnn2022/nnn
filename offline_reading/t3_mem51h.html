        <p>How did mom get it if she was masked and washing her hands? I understand that she couldn't be socially distanced, but her mask and PPE work, right? I hope the person whining isn't anti-science.</p>
<p>&rt;And if you think that is okay, if you think that is a consequence of you having all the conveniences in the world that you had prior to COVID, if you think that her life and the lives of others like her who weren't as fortunate to have made it are expendable so you can go to a fucking <em>bar</em>, you can go straight to hell.</p>
<p>Remember when the world stopped revolving during the annual influenza surges, Ebola, Zika, TB, HIV crises for the immunocompromised? I don't either, and she shouldn't expect the entire universe to change because of her. She should stay at home and protect herself like she has been all along.</p>
