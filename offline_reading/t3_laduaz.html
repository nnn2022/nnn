<title>There was an r/AskReddit post last spring where someone asked people who have had covid what it was like and the overwhelming response was "if I didn't know about this I would have assumed I had the flu" and it was uncontroversial; I don't know how things went on so long.</title>

    <p><p>Also, I just spent awhile searching for it and haven't been able to find it... Reddit's search function is shit and google didn't help much either because there's soooo much stuff since then. If you remember commenting it and have it in your history please link it I want to refresh my (and everyone else's) memory.</p></p>
