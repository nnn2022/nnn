    <strong>It's been 2 weeks since Labor Day, where are all the new Covid cases?</strong>
    <p><p>Weren't the family gatherings and vacations going to put us all in peril?   And speaking of new cases, what about the Sturgis motorcycle rally and the 260K new cases it was going to generate?  Are the hospitals overflowing yet?</p></p>

        <p>Didn't boomers mostly make the x generation though? So I guess it's the X gen that is mostly to blame for the spoiled upbringing of Millennials, yet somehow the x gen has kept their head down and mostly stayed out of the fighting.</p>

        <p>Halloween is basically cancelled according to my local news and they are telling parents to not let their kids trick or treat.</p>
<p>Trick or treating was already in decline because pussy parents to begin with.  Poor kids. Getting to go out on your own for a night is a thrilling thing and a small taste of independence that is becoming lost with the new generation.</p>
<p>No wonder all of these younger people are so terrified and want the government to do anything possible to make them feel safe.</p>

        <p>It's probably because these idiots think the only safe time to have Halloween is during the day, lol.</p>
<p>The guy I worked with wasn't from America so he didn't understand the culture but I don't understand how any parent who got to experience a real Halloween would deprive their kids of the same.  His excuse was the whole "needles in the candy" hoax that I guess is still floating around so he just bought candy for the kids to enjoy at home, lol.</p>

        <p>I do think it's tons easier to do final prep on costumes, stay out late getting candy, and holding parties on the weekend though.  Danger had nothing to do with it, having more time to party had everything to do with it!</p>

        <p>I mean as an adult all the big parties or events seem to be on the weekend immediately preceding Halloween or in some cases right after it. So it wasn't a problem for adults partying.</p>

        <p>What exactly is trunk or treat?</p>
<p>I heard people take their kids to the malls for some sanitized experience.</p>
<p>What made Halloween so awesome for kids in addition to the costumes was how it's often a child's first breath of freedom away from parents and I see it as an important step towards adulthood.</p>
<p>You are let loose and you can do the obvious which is get a such candy as possible (which is what I did) or you can take the evil route and go TP or egg a house and maybe you get caught and arrested and then you learn a valuable lesson that life has consequences.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a stretch but I think it's just another indication of the change in mentality from personal responsibility ability to what we have this now.</p>

        <p>A friend of mine was telling me about life in Germany (she's native German, married to an American).  They let the kids drink at 12.  </p>
<p>She says (and I 100% agree) that if they don't get exposed to things early and in an environment to keep it under control, they lose control when they have too much freedom at once.</p>
<p>Kids who know the taste of alcohol at 12 think it's no big deal when they're 18.  </p>
<p>That's what we're up against.  People that are so afraid of tainting their kids that they forget kids need to get germy and dirty and banged up a little, and fail a few tests, and not win a few awards.  Because having only a good life and shielded from everything bad makes you soft, and unprepared for the real world when it hits you.</p>

        <p>Yep, that lesson has fallen on deaf ears sadly, kids get whatever they want and then when they are 18 or 22 and finally have to confront failure, they lose their cookies. In many ways it's not their fault, if I was raised that way, I'd be a spoiled brat too.</p>

        <p>I feel you on that but with drugs/alcohol I think it's pretty clear that the data shows that the earlier you start drinking etc, the easier it is to have problems with it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the important different is that with the European model, a child is introduced to alcohol by the parents in a responsible manner as opposed to how I was introduced which was high school parties where you are just trying to get hammered.</p>
<p>I dunno, I'm sure we could have a great discussion about this over a beer, haha.</p>

        <p>That research is tricky because it's correlational.  It could well be in the USA that kids who drink early often have parents that are not around or are alcoholics for instance.</p>

        <p>I'm sure that parental influence has a lot to do with it, though.</p>
<p>If you have good parents that contextualize it the same way they would with a diet (e.g.: "Cookies are only good as a sometime food, not all the time.") then you probably won't have any problems.</p>

        <p>It wasn't a thing when I was a kid but I do know people who have kids that participate in this nonsense.</p>
<p>A group of parents will find a parking lot, open their trunks (which are decorated) while their kids go from car to car, getting candy. Or so I'm told. Sounds pretty lame. </p>
<p>While this may have started in more rural areas where trick or treating is impractical, it is a huge thing in the suburbs, sometimes with a churchy overtone.</p>

        <p>I'd imagine around your age and lower?  I think it depends on the demographics too though.  I noticed that it looked like a lot of latino families are still doing trick or treating although more people go with their parents.</p>
<p>My family always went to a big party at friends house and the parents were presumably getting drunk while all of the kids were released into the neighborhood on the candy mission.
There were no cell phones or curfews.  We just headed back to the house whenever people turned out their porch lights and stopped giving out candy probably around 9PM or something.</p>
<p>Anyways, the point is that safety culture has changed society drastically since I was a kid in the 80s/90s  but it's happened slowly over time so it's hard to define a single pivot point.</p>
<p>I think too many lawsuits is part of the trend.</p>

        <p>Maybe part of it is lazy parents too?  When I was a kid, my parents would walk on the sidewalk and keep an eye on me while I went up to the houses for candy which I think is responsible.  But they did not love doing it obviously, it was a hassle for them and parents these days may not be able to walk more than a few blocks!</p>

<p>The same authoritarians that allowed me to be beaten down, discouraged and rent through with word of malice and discontent are the ones that do the same today through fear, and it's always the same tired line: "It's for your own good."</p>

        <p>That's great.
I'm personally just trying to figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life after doing something that made me unhappy for the last decade.  However at the same time I have this overwhelming passion about not succumbing to this new normal insanity and don't even want to go back to work to have to deal with that.</p>

        <p>You misunderstand. Let me give you more detail:</p>
<p>I spent my life growing up, being told that I would need to be dependent. When I was eight, a doctor told my mother, in his exact words, that I would need to be in a mental institution, with someone to wipe my backside for me.</p>
<p>I was told I'd never have a family, or be a husband. That I couldn't have a job, join the military or have any kind of life whatsoever.</p>
<p>When you hear things like this for many years, and then are forced to take social security by no will of your own because your own mother never taught you how to live out of her own fear, it kills your ambition. Your will to live is trampled.</p>

        <p>&rt; No wonder all of these younger people are so terrified and want the government to do anything possible to make them feel safe.</p>
<p>I've been thinking this.  If you are commanded all of your life to take no risks, of course you are going to be risk-averse.</p>
<p>In the park the other day I watched a woman put her (7-9) year old on his bike.  But not before slathering him with sunscreen.  Then making sure his kneepads were on.  Then adjust his mask.  Then add the helmet.  To ride 30 yards on a smooth concrete path.</p>

        <p>I’m really interested in the media narrative for the holiday season. Most people were scared and in lockdown for Easter. Now after almost a year of this crap people are going to be traveling for Thanksgiving and Christmas like crazy. They are going to try to make us feel like murderers for <em>gasp</em> seeing our families for the holidays.</p>

        <p>I suspect a big issue is that when you are young, you just have not lived through a lot of claims by media and govt that did not come true, so you are more compliant and naive.   The longer you live, the more you start noticing patterns of bs and falling for them less.  When I was a kid working in retail, I was often targeted for any scam artists trying to scam the register operator, but once i got older, they never came to me, they always looked for the youngest one.</p>

        <p>If just one person is caught playing golf without a mask, the media will pounce all over it and golfers will be blamed for the next lockdown because that is how the media works.  Even if 99.9999 percent of people comply, it won't matter, because plenty of research shows that lockdowns are not working to slow the virus anyway.</p>

        <p>How many months are they going to use that and people keep falling for it?  Just got a neighbor saying that a few hours ago, she assumed California is going under increased lockdown due to 'labor day.'  But the real reason is the governor has moved the goal posts, cases and deaths are down but he made the requirements more stringent.  Remember when Florida was surely going to burn in hell with deaths because they allowed spring break?  THen when it didn't happen, media just moved on to someone else that would surely burn in hell..</p>

        <p>Well, to be fair, case numbers have been going up here in my state (North Dakota) in an absolute sense quite a bit in the past month, they crossed 500 in a day for the first time today, though if you look at percent positives from testing that hasn't really gone up above a consistent 5%.  We're really only getting more cases because they're testing a lot more.  About a quarter of the state's population has been tested.  Yet we haven't even reached 10% capacity filled for regular hospitalizations, much less ICU beds.  Yet our media is still freaking out because of the rising case numbers, especially after they were previously so low.  Since we're out in the middle of nowhere essentially, it's possible that we're finally getting our "second wave" after the spring, since the numbers for percent positives and deaths are looking equal to May's here in August and September when they plummeted in June and July.  I had thought that it already had burned through, but I guess not, it's "second wave" time.  Better to get it out of the way now rather than have it ruin the holidays.  Oh, who am I kidding, they'll do their best to ruin the holidays anyway, no matter what happens.</p>

        <p>Well locally covid hospitalizations have dropped quite a bit but they were only ever a small percentage of hospitalizations to start with and overall hospitalizations have been fairly flat for most places so it depends on what specific number you are speaking of.  Even when the news says hospitals are 'overrun,' a lot of times if you really dig into it, they are the same hospitals that get over run every year due to not having enough coverage for that area (usually poor areas).</p>

        <p>Then thats your right, of course. </p>
<p>Blind trust in political/media authority is my issue.    Major worldwide media is owned by only six corporations...basically 6 CEO's can shape what is "truth".   Combine that with the blatant censorship that social media enforces where even the accounts of experiences of real doctors in their real clinics are being scrubbed because they run counter to the official narrative, makes for rocky terrain when trying to determine what is really going on, IMO.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you drank the Koolaid, covid deaths have been declining steadily in the USA and across the world and only a tiny percentage of those who get covid actually die from it, they did not 'all die,' LOL!!!  More people die from car accidents than covid and I bet you are still getting in your car and driving it at least sometimes.  Just look both ways before you pull out into an intersection and don't lick toilets and the odds will be on your side.</p>

        <p>Everyone here knows that 200k Americans have died with COVID-19. We are unperturbed by that number because instead of just reacting emotionally to the fact that it’s a number that ends in “hundred thousand” and just childishly assuming that that makes it really big-sounding and really bad, we contextualize it and think critically about what it really signifies. That includes considerations like the fact that early pandemic models predicted 1-2 million deaths, the fact that 3M Americans die of all causes in a normal year, and the fact that these particular 200k were almost all at the end of their very long natural lives. Then we weigh those considerations against the costs of the pandemic reaction, and we conclude that 200k is quite an acceptable number of deaths WITH ‘rona in the US.</p>
