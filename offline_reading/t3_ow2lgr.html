    <strong>A letter to the "I have a family to support" people that don't want the vaccine but feel they have no choice but to get it</strong>
    <p><p>It's high time to stop using your family as an excuse not to fight the rollout of vaccine mandates/passports and other overreach by their governments. </p>
<p>I get it. You want to provide your kids with a comfortable life. Almost everyone does. But is it really worth giving up your bodily autonomy, your freedom, to give your kids the comfy middle class lifestyle you enjoy within this increasingly technocratic Brave New Normal, rather than show your kids what liberty means and opt out of it?</p>
<p>If you don't make an effort BECAUSE of your kids, there won't be a free world FOR your kids to inherit.  </p>
<p>Some of us didn't grow up with a whole lot. I guarantee there is some sacrifice to be made in the fight for a free world of informed consent and the right to make our own medical decisions and not face some kind of sanction because of it. </p>
<p>If you've already accepted that there may be a time when you will have to fold and just get the vaccine you don't want, you've already given up. </p>
<p>So take a good long look in the mirror and ask yourself, is it really worth keeping this job? This position? Getting to travel to the places I want? If it means being coerced into participating in this global experiment? </p>
<p>Remember that courage is contagious. The more people that stand in solidarity against this tyranny, the better. Standing up for yourself and refusing is courageous. It sets an example for others to follow. Be the example. Don't be a coward and fold because things get tough for you. No, it won't be easy. Yes, you will have to give some things up. Maybe a lot of things. But it won't be your freedom to make your own choice regarding what you put into your own body.</p></p>

        <p>I didn't have as many years in, but here is my experience. I walked away from a career I spent five years working in, after going to school for two years to do it and basically planning my career since sophomore year of high school. I didn't leave because of a vaccine or some noble goal of fighting for liberty, I left nursing just because I didn't really like it and because I hated what the healthcare system does to frail old people to turn them into dollars. I went into a completely unrelated field that I knew nothing about and had no experience in, and now I'm much happier for it despite not making as much money. Now seven years of devoted time is not equal to 16 years, but it is certainly possible to spend a significant amount of time in one profession and then do a complete 180 based on personal satisfaction and principles.</p>

        <p>Well I quit nursing in 2019 so I don't have any info other than what my wife tells me, she is also a nurse. Yes plenty of the residents at the nursing home did die "with COVID" at the beginning, whether or not COVID is what did them in or the tests were accurate is a different story altogether. I knew many of the ones who died and not one of them had any right to be still alive in 2020, one foot in the grave or even two feet for every single one of the residents that I remembered.</p>

        <p>I get that. We can hope that there will be enough push back that it will be unenforceable. But I suppose it depends on the agency. I also hope to see class actions, but then I am definitely not putting all my eggs into the legal system to save us.</p>

        <p>Look hard for religious or allergy exemptions. They don't "advertise" them but they are typically there in the fine print of such vaccine policies. You are suddenly religious or allergic. </p>
<p>Or fake the proof?</p>
<p>Find other people in a similar situation who want to avoid the vax. They may have ideas as well. I understand the dilemma but there's usually a loophole somewhere. Don't give up without researching it a little if its important to you.</p>

        <p>I’m also 16 years in the federal government. I have two coworkers out for over a month due to adverse reactions. One lost vision in his left eye and some other health issues. The other had seven clots removed. I wonder how they will make ends meet when their annual leave and sick leave run out. I told my husband I am not getting the thing. I rather lose it all and keep my health than lose my health and then lose my job anyways. If undocumented people can find work, I’m sure I’ll be able to find something that won’t require proof of vaccination. My son and DIL are in the military and are facing the same dilemma. Unfortunately there isn’t a lot of information from legal experts regarding how to fight this.</p>

        <p>I told my ex I have to take our kid if I flee to another state BECAUSE he will just do what's most convenient for him, ie get him vaccinated. It's the truth even if he doesn't want to hear it. He swears he'll fight any mandate to keep his job, but his wife got the V the very minute it was offered to her even though she hates all this covid shit. I also told him I would rather homeschool our kid than put a mask on him again and he started whining about how hard virtual school was so he doesn't want to homeschool. It is VERY hard coparenting with someone who isn't taking this shit seriously. I feel for those who coparent with sheep/NPCs, but a weak coparent is basically the same fucking thing.</p>

        <p>I’m in the same boat. My wife (soon to be ex wife most likely) is a sheep who strongly disagrees with me about Covid and the vaccine. I don’t want to ever take it, I also never want my kids to take it or be masked. She will do whatever authority tells her and continue to live in a bubble. I feel so defeated and helpless. I know we need to divorce and I need to be with a woman who sees eye to eye with me.</p>

        <p>Exactly. We are only still together because of the kids at this point, but it’s become unbearable. I know in my heart it’s time to move on to the next chapter, but the thought of not seeing my kids very often makes me sick to my stomach.</p>

        <p>While I agree with the spirit if your post, but I'm actually pretty much over listening to fables about a "sleeping right" that will awaken and fight for the constitution. I've listened to and believed in stories about the legendary American spirit that would push back against tyranny if it ever tried to take over.</p>
<p>I do not believe it any longer.</p>
<p>It's just a imaginary quality Americans are too lazy or too weak to actually manifest. The left has pushed past so many red lines and taken so many rights away, and every time the response from the right is "exposing the lefts narrative" and empty threats about the "sleeping right" and its awesome power. The so called "resistance" can't even get their own representation in DC to truly back them, let alone reign in power hungry communists. </p>
<p>These people are actively removing our ability to live freely in our own nation and breaking federal laws in front of everyone's face, and we just keep "exposing" them, as if they're even trying to hide it‽</p>
<p>I served overseas, I've seen more open combat then I care to remember and have no problem fighting for what I believe in, but there's no actual resistance to join. Just random people basically jumping on social hand grenades, a go-fund-me, then back to daydreaming about 2022-2024 when we will supposedly take back our country by participating in another rigged election so we can get another corrupt politician in office, just this one will wear a red tie!! So that'll be nice...</p>
<p>Basically, I think it's over and I think people are fooling themselves into believing there's an underground army just waiting for the right time to spring up. If the constitution had any actual support with any actual power in DC, authoritarian Marxists  wouldn't have been able to take over the cia, fbi, nsa, universities, entertainment,  national sports, the medical community, the legal community, the upper ranks (at least) of the military, public education and all 3 branches of government. </p>
<p>The only hope we would have is a unification of the working class across ideological lines that holds the powerful accountable with a single focus, but everyone sees we're just moving farther apart in that regard. I can't even get many people to agree their problems are with the ruling class and not with the fellow poor person down the hall who voted for biden/Trump. We are closer to civil war then we are to a unified resistance, and divided we don't stand a chance IMO.  They would happily slaughter/imprison half of us if we stood in their way and if the other half gave them a pass. I don't see either side standing up for the other anymore, not in any meaningful way at least. </p>
<p>Who knows, maybe I'm wrong and the Horowitz report is coming out real soon??...</p>

        <p>Might be silly, but from this thread and LockdownSkepticism… from my dad… from the handful of friends that I know are on the same page as me… I feel like because of those people, there MUST be more.</p>
<p>I have a toddler and another on the way and although I have extreme guilt for bringing them in to the world, I HAVE to have some level of hope in order to be a good mother.</p>
<p>I really do believe we live in the best country in the world, despite our many problems, and I do think the “spirit” of our country will prevail.  Maybe not in it’s entirety, but some version of our country will continue on by those that band together.</p>
<p>And this is REALLY silly, but everything I wished for when I was younger has eventually come true… granted those wishes were to become a lifeguard, move to CA (I was naive!!!), become best friends with my college roommate and have my parents remain together, but they all came true! And my other wish was to live to be of very old age with a family.  Hopefully not jinxing myself, but I’m really counting on that last one to round it all out… so, that’s where my hope lies on these dark days!</p>
<p>I know the above is corny but it’s all I got.</p>

        <p>This is really the issue. Not many of us have the financial means to just quit our job, especially when every other one will require it too. I fear that they are going to get their way one way or another and those who don’t comply will be made poor and destitute. </p>

        <p>Silver's going to be worthless too.</p>
<p>Their plan is to implement a digital global currency and render everything else worthless. Gold, silver, bitcoin, whatever. All of it will be worthless. (And before you say "YEAH, WELL, PEOPLE LIKE US WILL WANT TO TRADE GOLD AND SILVER, YOU SHILL BIDEN BOT", well, good luck with that. If it's not worth anything, people won't care, and since they are gunning for an "own nothing" society, jewelry and metals will be useless for pawns like us.)</p>
