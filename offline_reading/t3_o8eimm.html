    <strong>To all the People who joined us Recently.</strong>
    <p><p>Every day more and more peoples eyes open, that theyve been lied to, cheated, swindled under false presidence, lying that all the measures were for their safety, that the vaccine was safe, without side effects and would be the key for you to get your freedoms back</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I want all of you who recently have joined us and turned their ways to know,</p>

<p>We hold no Schadenfreude for the pain you may have had to endure at the hands of those who swore to keep you safe under false pretense, lying into your face that everything was for your best,</p>
<p>The loved ones you may have been unable to stand besides as they parted out of this world or those who were struck down or forever scarred by the Vaccines, were not mad at you or make fun of you for such horrible things to have happened upon yourselves for we know that truly deep down you had good intent but were merely deceived into following blindly.</p>
<p>We hold no Anger against you, were simply glad that you have found out about the truth.</p>
<p>Welcome to r/NoNewNormal .</p>

<p>And No, we do not trust the Privately owned Organizations Info's on the safety of their Products.</p>

        <p>Welcome, everyone new! You will find that most of us are NOT "anti vaccine" - we just want the right to choose. That's all.</p>
<p>We are the people who want the most freedom for everyone. We want government and corporate transparency. We want disclosure when "experts" are financially incentivized (such as the CEO of Reuters being on the board of directors at Pfizer, but you'll find nearly ALL "experts" are connected financially to this agenda, including people at the CDC that own patents used in the new mRNA vaccines.)</p>
<p>When people have a financially vested interest, it colors their opinions and what should be news turns in to propaganda and covert advertising. When they couple that with force, coercion, censorship and silencing of doctors, medical workers, and scientists all over the world -- what we have is the greatest controversy of our lives.</p>
<p>Let's work together and put a stop to this madness.</p>

        <p>I don't know anything about the Measles Vax, I have no stance...</p>
<p>But think of it another way. Someone has already won the war of public opinion on that topic, causing the original anti-vaxxers to be viewed pretty negatively. I believe they are attempting to leverage that previous win in order to crush us here today by dismissing us as crazy anti-vaxxers.</p>
<p>Messages like the OP are likely our best chance at winning this one. By picking a very narrow topic, with a growing mountain of evidence and support in its favour. And if we win this one, perhaps mainstream people will be more open to questioning the Measles Vax in the end.</p>
<p>Sacrifice a pawn, to take a queen.</p>
<p>I don't like appealing to sheep either... but if you don't lead them to sanity, someone else will lead them to commit atrocities against us.</p>

        <p>I think measles vaccines cause autism. I think there is a cost/benefit analysis to be done when it comes to any medication. I also think the nanobots in the vaccine will react to the 5g in a “programmable” manner. If you think the reward is greater than the risk then good for you. If you don’t then good for you. Don’t speak for me</p>

        <p>I’m currently up to date on all my VACCINES. I try to not go that deep into discussing any of this. I just have my opinions and let other people have theirs. </p>
<p>In my own experience, Changing opinions is completely up to each person individually. I don’t think there are any “facts” that will change anyones mind. I feel “facts” only strengthen opinions. In other words I find Fact is a word open to subjection.</p>

Your kid doesn't have ADD if he can't focus and wants to run around. It means he's a kid with energy and it's normal. These drugs are turning kids into zombies.</p>

At any rate we don’t want the new normal. If we negotiate with these people then we lose. We are all people even if we are psychopaths or saints.

        <p>Agreed, they use the 5G people to paint all of us as unreasonable conspiracy theorists. I believe they are the minority. I think most of us here are not generally anti-vax, but simply skeptical to take a rushed experimental mRNA injection for a virus with a very high survival rate, especially for healthy individuals under 70.</p>

        <p>Honestly if there's one thing everyone should learn from this whole situation, it is to keep an open mind and think for yourself.  You are your own human and need to put effort into keeping up to date on everything that affects you, whether that be politics, medicine, etc.  Neither the Government nor private companies have your best interest at heart. Enough floating along and "trusting the experts" with your well being.</p>

        <p>ive been around 5g quite alot thanks to my industry i work at, so far hasnt done anything to me</p>
<p>i got very little vaccines (i just forgot em lol) and i still had ADHD as a kid, changed when i came of age, most my classmates were and now are vaccinated out the hoohaa and id definitely would never say theyre Autistic in any way</p>
<p>so, personal experience</p>
<p>however if you do believe these things, and if you do i support your freedom of belief all the way, id just say its important that youd atleast aknowledge that, and i mean this in the most respectful way possible, in this specific community that its a minority belief.</p>

        <p>I thinK you are missing the point. We are united on a singular issue, but that doesnt mean the singular issue is all vaccines or bad or that 5G is bad. Try to stay focused on one battle at a time because people like the OP And me are trying to unite over a singular issue...that something very fucked up and corrupt is going on, and psychological techniques are being used to brainwash and/or hypnotise the population in to complying.
Also, Id like to believe that what unites us is that we all each other to have different opinions about other issues, and we dont need to agree on everything to be united on this issue</p>

        <p>Did junk food and office jobs not happen until the '90s? Or is there maybe something else that was rolled out in the '90s?</p>
<p>&rt;In 1990, obese adults made up less than 15 percent of the population in most U.S. states. By 2010, 36 states had obesity rates of 25 percent or higher, and 12 of those had obesity rates of 30 percent or higher. (1)</p>
<p>&rt;Today, nationwide, roughly two out of three U.S. adults are overweight or obese (69 percent) and one out of three is obese (36 percent). (2) While U.S. obesity rates have, overall, stayed steady since 2003, the rates are still rising in some groups, and disparities persist: Non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and Mexican American adults have higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic white adults. (2)</p>
<p>&rt;Even more alarming, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is on the rise, and youth are becoming overweight and obese at earlier ages. One out of six children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 are obese and one out of three are overweight or obese. (3)</p>

        <p>As someone who has been against this "new normal" bullshit from the very beginning (I have receipts for anyone who doubts me), I don't agree.</p>
<p>It's not enough to simply change your mind about the "new normal".  It matters WHY you changed your mind.</p>
<p>Did you come to NNN because you looked deep inside, acknowledged your flaws, and experienced a profound change in response?  Or are you just here because you can no longer tolerate the insane rules and restrictions and want them to be over so you can go back to living in la-la land?</p>
<p>Obviously, I'll take whatever I can get.  The more people who oppose this insanity, the better.  But if you're only here because you were personally inconvenienced by the "new normal", then you haven't really changed.  You're still the same myopic, self-centered individual you were when all this started.  And while that shouldn't stop you from joining NNN, it does matter on a philosophical level.</p>

        <p>I was vaccinated many times in my life already, half of these jabs was my own choice after I was 18y old, the other half were the vaccines they give to all the kids. I never opposed, I trust the science of a vaccine that was tested for 20 years on average for any potential danger.</p>
<p>I’m not against vaccines, I’m against THAT ONE vaccine that was rushed in 8 months just so Pfizer can get the dibs on the panicking governments tax money. Yet I will be called antivaxx all the same, how does that make any sense?</p>

        <p>it doesnt.</p>
<p>btw it seems were very much in the same boat when it comes to our vaccination stories throughout life haha</p>
<p>then again thats the case for most people here, got vaccinations all their life, doesnt oppose them, doesnt believe in inherent harm, wants simply free choice and credible testing etc</p>

        <p>I’m sorry for the young people today who have so many vaccines forced on them as kids.  I grew up in a different era and only had the chicken pox, measles, polio and tetanus vaccines as a kid and a second tetanus shot at 18. Never took a flu vax and never will because I don’t trust the crap that is put in them or the companies that make them, just as I don’t trust our corrupt government.  I’ve had the flu four times in almost 51 years.</p>
