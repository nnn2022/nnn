    <strong>From the corona sub...</strong>
    <p><p>"This is why rational people need to start lying about Coronavirus.</p>
<p>"Do you *know* anyone who got it?"</p>
<p>If you're being truthful, you probably dont. Just as you don't know anyone who's eating fast food at this very moment, or taking a walk outside. That doesn't mean fast food joints are empty and nobody is walking outside right now.</p>
<p>The answer is yes, yes you know someone with Covid who died. Yes, you know children with Covid who died.</p>
<p>In this same way, if someone at work is spouting nonsense about Covid, you need to have the courage to say "I know people who died from this, and you need to stop saying this right now. It's disrespectful to me, to the memories of those we lost, and its disrespectful to the healthcare workers fighting this on the front lines."</p>
<p>Become a patriot for medical health and safety the way Yall Qaeda did about troops after 9/11."</p></p>

        <p>It’s called pious fraud and it’s probably been going on as long as there has been organized religions.  This article covers Christian and Islamic examples, but I’m sure the concept probably exists in other religions.   </p>
<p>https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pious_fraud</p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pious_fraud</p>
<p>Just goes to show how the doomers have turned this into a religion and it not about the science at all. </p>
<p>Btw, I do not think most Christians or most Muslims approve of this.</p>
<p>Edit:  also, I am sure that some/most of the doctors/scientists saying that the epidemic would end if everyone wears masks knows perfectly well that there is no evidence for that.  So, lots of the people pushing the new normal are doing this.  And, it’s utterly bankrupt because if you can’t convince people to do something with the truth, then maybe you shouldn’t even be trying.</p>

        <p>I’m kind of curious to know what percentage of people on that sub are religious. It’s feeling more and more like a cult mentality. </p>
<p>Their willingness to believe what a few “experts” tell them without any skepticism whatsoever. </p>
<p>Their tactics on keeping the narrative going and silencing/shunning those who dissent. </p>
<p>Some of the parallels with religion go pretty deep here.</p>
<p>Edit: 
I think it’s really cool that people from both religious and non-religious world views can come to the same conclusion that lockdowns are wrong. No matter what your religious background, we are all in this fight together.</p>

        <p>Ya I mean I am an atheist, I’m not gonna argue with the fact that some atheists act this way. People naturally like to feel like they belong to a group or a common cause.</p>
<p>For some people this “religion” is politics, for others, it’s science.</p>
<p>Then there’s those of us who don’t subscribe to any of these groups. </p>
<p>I believe in the scientific method, but I have a much higher threshold for belief than your average doomer. Science requires skepticism, reflection, and constant revision. </p>

        <p>I’d imagine that it’s a lack of defined religious sentiments that result in what we’re seeing. I’ve come to believe that most people need religion or some kind of faith system in life. There’s obviously been a large push towards atheism in recent decades and I imagine most of the “progressive” reddit manchild types consider themselves atheists. What they don’t realize is that their ideology of progressivism (which in many cases is just regurgitating the status quo and the issue en Vogue) has become basically a religion for them.</p>
<p>I think the phrase “believe science” reflects this quite well. Many don’t analyze or question what comes down from the priests and ministers of their religion. Some of these may include John Oliver, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Billy Nye, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Colbert.... You probably get the point. I struggle to succinctly put this into words because I don’t believe most of their proclamations are actually progressive, but I’m not sure of a word to generally refer to these people. Basically, their life is devoid of any actual spiritual practice, so they fill this void with things like science or social justice issues and any dissenters deserve to be ostracized from society.</p>

        <p>Sorry,I'm an atheist and I'm not into believing or telling lies.  I do my own research in the world and I don't listen to others.  I haven't seen any signs that the Covid-19, SARS COV-2, or coronavirus (pick your favorite title for the virus) is that dangerous.  It's just not.  I also don't believe that the virus has any religious significance nor does my behavior towards the virus.</p>

        <p>&rt;Taqiya is the Muslim belief that lying is not a sin if it's done in the service of Islam, ie a just cause</p>
<p>I'm a Muslim. </p>
<p>This is a common over-simplification and distortion that was created to cause the perception that Muslims are inherently dishonest and cannot be trusted.  </p>
<p>The historical background of this misconception: </p>
<p>It seems to have been popularised by far-right personalities who sought to foment hatred against Muslims among Europeans in the name of preserving European culture from the alleged influence of Middle Eastern, Asian, and African Muslim migration, which they claim is a kind of foreign invasion.</p>
<p>What Taqiyya really is:</p>
<p>Taqiyya exists primarily in Shi'i Islam, and is not really recognised by the Sunni majority(though it may exist to a much lesser degree). It revolves around lying about one's beliefs to escape persecution.  It has nothing to do with lying more generally. In my understanding, the reason for this practice is that historically, Shiite muslims tended to be (and still are) persecuted by the Sunni majority. It also applies to lying about whether one is a muslim or not to avoid persecution in hostile non-Muslim lands to save oneself from danger.</p>
<p>It does not have anything to do with lying in general. Lying is a sin in Islam.</p>
<p>Edit: In fact, there is a story about the prophet Muhammad (may the most high exalt him) which may have served as the original basis for the legal principle of taqiyya among Muslims.I hope I have the story right. The story basically says that a muslim man was captured during a journey by the Meccans, who were at war with all Muslims at the time. In an effort to get him to renounce his faith, they proceeded to torture him. Fearing for his life, the man renounced his faith  and they was released. On his return, the second man was deeply remorseful and is said to have wept. Muhammad basically told him that he did the right thing by denouncing the faith to save himself from harm or death, and that if confronted with a similar situation in the future, he should do the same. From this, Shiite scholars derived the legal principle of Taqiyya.</p>

        <p>You started off lying about how Muslims were peacefully migrating when it's well-documented, historical fact they were armed invasions. Then, you simply continued lying, like claiming the practice doesn't exist among the Sunni, when it does and is called muda'rat.</p>
<p>Since you insist on continuing your lies, here is the proof, literally chapter and verse.</p>
<p>Quran (16:106) - Establishes that there are circumstances that can "compel" a Muslim to tell a lie.</p>
<p>Quran (3:28) - This verse tells Muslims not to take those outside the faith as friends, unless it is to "guard themselves" against danger, meaning that there are times when a Muslim may appear friendly to non-Muslims, even though they should not feel friendly.</p>
<p>Quran (9:3) - "...Allah and His Messenger are free from liability to the idolaters..." The dissolution of oaths is with pagans who remained at Mecca following its capture. They did nothing wrong, but were evicted anyway.  (The next verse refers only to those who have a personal agreement with Muhammad as individuals - see Ibn Kathir vol 4, p 49)</p>
<p>Quran (66:2) - "Allah has already ordained for you the dissolution of your oaths..." The circumstances for the reader today are not specified, leaving this verse open to interpretation.  According to Yusuf Ali in his commentary: "if your vows prevent you from doing good, or acting rightly, or making peace between persons, you should expiate the vow."  Presumably, whatever advances the cause of Islam would qualify as ' doing good'.</p>
<p>Quran (40:28) - A man is introduced as a believer, but one who had to "hide his faith" among those who are not believers.</p>
<p>Quran (2:225) - "Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts"  (see also 5:89)</p>
<p>Quran (3:54) - "And they (the disbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed (against them): and Allah is the best of schemers." The Arabic word used here for scheme (or plot) is makara, which means 'cunning,' 'guile' and 'deceit'. If Allah is supremely deceitful toward unbelievers, then there is little basis for denying that Muslims are allowed to do the same. (See also 8:30 and 10:21)</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari (52:269) - "The Prophet said, 'War is deceit.'" The context of this is thought to be the murder of Usayr ibn Zarim and his thirty unarmed companions by Muhammad's men after they were "guaranteed" safe passage (see Additional Notes below).</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari (49:857) - "He who makes peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a liar." Lying is permitted when the end justifies the means.</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari (84:64-65) - Speaking from a position of power at the time, Ali confirms that lying is permitted in order to deceive an "enemy."  The Quran defines the 'enemy' as "disbelievers" (4:101).</p>
<p>Sahih Muslim (32:6303) - "...he did not hear that exemption was granted in anything what the people speak as lie but in three cases: in battle, for bringing reconciliation amongst persons and the narration of the words of the husband to his wife, and the narration of the words of a wife to her husband (in a twisted form in order to bring reconciliation between them)."</p>
<p>Sahih Bukhari (50:369) - Recounts the murder of a poet, Ka'b bin al-Ashraf, at Muhammad's insistence. The men who volunteered for the assassination used dishonesty to gain Ka'b's trust, pretending that they had turned against Muhammad. This drew the victim out of his fortress, whereupon he was brutally slaughtered.</p>
<p>From Islamic Law:</p>
<p>Reliance of the Traveler (p. 746 - 8.2) - "Speaking is a means to achieve objectives. If a praiseworthy aim is attainable through both telling the truth and lying, it is unlawful to accomplish through lying because there is no need for it. When it is possible to achieve such an aim by lying but not by telling the truth, it is permissible to lie if attaining the goal is permissible (N:i.e. when the purpose of lying is to circumvent someone who is preventing one from doing something permissible), and obligatory to lie if the goal is obligatory... it is religiously precautionary in all cases to employ words that give a misleading impression...  (See the Permissible Lying section on the Sharia page for more)</p>
<p>"One should compare the bad consequences entailed by lying to those entailed by telling the truth, and if the consequences of telling the truth are more damaging, one is entitled to lie."</p>
<p>I'm blocking you now. Goodbye.</p>

        <p>Why can't we have a civil discussion? There is no need to accuse me of lying just because I have a differing view on a subject.</p>
<p>To begin with, you have quoted a number of ahadith. I am not qualified to determine whether any of those narrations are actually authentic. Simply quoting a hadith says nothing about whether the prophet actually said or did any of these things, and I personally have always taken my Islamic views almost entirely from the Qur'an for this reason. There are muslims who will say that everything in Sahih al Bukhari actually happened, but many of us do not. The hadith literature is a compendium of narrations; some true, many false. Furthermore, there is a wide range of positions on authenticity of various hadith books, and the question of whether these narrations should be relied on at all. So every muslim is responsible only for defending those ahadith which they accept. If you want to attack anything in Islam based on ahadith, then attack people who actually believe in and accept the legitimacy of those ahadith.</p>
<p>&rt;You started off lying about how Muslims were peacefully migrating when it's well-documented, historical fact they were armed invasions. </p>
<p>I was talking about current ongoing Muslim migration from the parts of the world I mentioned into European countries. I'm not talking about past invasions by Muslim empires centuries ago.</p>
<p>&rt;Quran (16:106) - Establishes that there are circumstances that can "compel" a Muslim to tell a lie.</p>
<p>Yes, in situations where one is compelled, for example in the face of persecution. That's the context. That's what it means. You're leaving out the clear reference to compulsion to push your narrative.</p>
<p>&rt;Quran (3:28) - This verse tells Muslims not to take those outside the faith as friends, unless it is to "guard themselves" against danger, meaning that there are times when a Muslim may appear friendly to non-Muslims, even though they should not feel friendly.</p>
<p>This verse is commonly misinterpreted and misused. The Arabic word auliyah, can mean friend, but it can also mean ally or supporter or helper, in the political sense. At the time of the Qur'an first being revealed, there was a war being the muslims and the people of Mecca. Allegiances were often made along religious lines. It was important that muslims did not form allegiances with the polytheistic of Mecca to avoid infiltration. </p>
<p>Quran (60:8) confirms that muslims are not forbidden from being friends with people who are not hostile to us and do not oppress us. This confirms that (3:28) is in fact a restriction on forming allegiances with enemy factions. "Disbelievers" in the Qur'an here primarily refers to the Meccans and all who, like them, are at war with muslims as a whole. It does not refer simply to people who do not believe in Islam. This is, to my mind, the correct interpretation. One does not understand islam by simply choosing specific verses in isolation. So it is quite simple: don't make friends with you enemies, and make friends with those who do not threaten you.</p>
<p>&rt;Quran (9:3) - "...Allah and His Messenger are free from liability to the idolaters..." The dissolution of oaths is with pagans who remained at Mecca following its capture. They did nothing wrong, but were evicted anyway.  (The next verse refers only to those who have a personal agreement with Muhammad as individuals - see Ibn Kathir vol 4, p 49)</p>
<p>There seems to be some debate about the situation being referred to by the verse. Some scholars say it was the result of the Meccans breaking the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. The full context for some verses is not universally agreed upon across the religion.</p>
<p>&rt;Quran (3:54) - "And they (the disbelievers) schemed, and Allah schemed (against them): and Allah is the best of schemers." The Arabic word used here for scheme (or plot) is makara, which means 'cunning,' 'guile' and 'deceit'. If Allah is supremely deceitful toward unbelievers, then there is little basis for denying that Muslims are allowed to do the same. (See also 8:30 and 10:21)</p>
<p>This is a deeply dishonest and unfair argument, as we are exhorted several times in the text to be truthful and honest in our dealings. The "scheming" of God cannot be likened with human deception at all considering that we are speaking of a an ostensibly omnipotent and omniscient being. Predestination or some other expression of divine power driven by His wisdom can scarcely be compared to human manipulations and lies.  How can you go from God "schemes" to "Muslims can lie whenever they want for self-professed religious reasons"?</p>
<p>&rt;Quran (2:225) - "Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts"  (see also 5:89)</p>
<p>This is another deeply dishonest use of the text.</p>
<p>The previous verse reads: "Do not make God a pretext, when you swear by Him, to avoid doing good, being righteous and making peace between people. God is all hearing and all knowing."</p>
<p>Oaths here can mean the whole range of things that we promise to ourselves and others. The specific scenario here is but one such possibility. Furthermore we have been warned in the verse I just quoted that we are not to use God, and oaths before himn-and more broadly - religious devotion, as an excuse to cause harm or commit wrongdoing or cause discord among people. So to imply that this verse is a direct blanket endorsement of lying for religion (which is your interpretation of Taqiyyah - which I believe is false) is deeply inaccurate, dishonest unfair and an indication of your preconceived set of ideas - and dear I say - agenda. We are being instructed in this verse not to do the exact thing that you are accusing the next verse of being the permission for based on a specific interpretation of the verse, which isn't even warranted by the general nature of the verse. You are trying to prove something based on a verse whose prequel sets up moral caveats which disprove what you are saying. Is that why you didn't quote verse 224?</p>
<p>There is a clear indication that the justice and protection from aggression and harm is a precondition for what one does here. You leave this out, because it doesn't fit your narrative. So again, I claim that this verse(224) disproves your claim that God, or religious adherence, can justifiably be used as an excuse to deceive others for self-serving, or otherwise immoral reasons.</p>
<p>&rt;Quran (40:28) - A man is introduced as a believer, but one who had to "hide his faith" among those who are not believers.</p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p>Here is the whole verse: </p>
<p>"A believer, a man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith, said, "Would you slay a man merely because he says, "My Lord is God." He has brought you clear signs from your Lord, and if he is lying, the sin of his will be on his own head; but if he is truthful, a part of that of which he warns you will surely befall you. Certainly, God does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar."</p>
<p>He was among the Pharaoh's people(some interpretations even say his family) which obviously meant that he concealed it to avoid persecution or even being killed by the Pharaoh, (which is what would definitely have happened to him given what we know about that Pharaoh) from the Qur'anic (and even the Biblical narrative). You left whole section of information our deliberately. Is this why you didn't quote the verse? Again, this was concealment for protection from harm.</p>
<p>You're trying to portray these verses of the Qur'an as though they are supporting deception without qualification by any moral principles such as seeking to avoid harm to yourself and others. Yet the verses you are quoting are taken from contexts where it is quite clear that there are deep moral caveats underlying all these situations.</p>
<p>If you wanted an honest dialogue, and you weren't just here to push the narrative that the whole religion is evil, and that I am a liar, you wouldn't have blocked me. You would have had a friendly, calm, non-confrontational exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p>No PPE shortage at my hospital. I don't know what the problem is with any hospital that had a PPE shortage, but mine had plenty of masks. It was as if the owners knew how to run a hospital or something!  They knew to always have masks even before this started!!  And to think we are only a small independent Private hospital too. We weren't a huge corporate giant like other hospitals who claim to not have enough supplies.  My hospital, with no share holders had everything it needed!!  Any hospital that had a PPE shortage was either lying or run like shit. </p>
<p>And we only wear masks when in hallways and patient care areas. That is the policy. We don't wear them in offices. That means that I can talk to other staff members without wearing a mask anytime we're not where patients are.  My job is biomedical technician. That takes me all through the hospital to every deparent every day.</p>

        <p>That makes more sense. Thank you for the clarification. There seems to be a lot of variation between hospitals, even in hard hit areas. I know from my family’s experience that one of the NYC hospitals where there was a major crisis reported in the news was poorly managed and had a bad reputation for many, many years.</p>

        <p>Lying about knowing someone who died of COVID in the middle of a pandemic shouldn’t go wrong at all. If these doomers do that, they should be fired as soon as their lie is found out. People in offices gossip. </p>

        <p>dear lord they are just blatantly lying now. </p>
<p>I very very vaguely know one person who died who had covid. Notice how I dont say "died OF covid"? Yeah because this woman was 87 years old, very senile and had been in and out of hospital for many things in the past 2 years. And I think I may have met this woman twice? She was the great aunt of a friend of mine. </p>
<p>My friend is of course very sad her auntie is dead and that, due to the virus, she had to say her goodbyes wearing full PPE en wasnt allowed to hold her aunties hand. Yes her auntie had covid when she died. Did that speed up her demise? I dont know. Possibly.  But she likely would have died soon without it anyway.</p>
<p>All the virus really did was keep her family and friends from hugging her one more time.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And that is the only person I have any relation to at all that I know died with covid in their system. </p>
<p>Now America may be a shitshow now with many cases of the virus. But in my country it happens to be pretty chilled.  So dont go telling me I probably know loads of people who have the virus/who died from it.  I dont.  Stop lying.</p>

<p>Like, listen to Biden talking about how Trump is “the first racist president”. It would seem obvious that Trump is probably less racist than the presidents who <em>literally owned slaves</em> or did the Trail of Tears.</p>

        <p>Anyone claiming they know multiple children who died from covid is almost certainly a liar. Certainly, there are many more Americans who are straight-up habitual/compulsive liars than there are Americans who know multiple children who have died from this virus.</p>
