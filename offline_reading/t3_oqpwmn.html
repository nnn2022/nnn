        <p>Why aren't they using them on the illegals at the border!?  It's so important that everyone get the shot, that they want to go door to door inoculating all citizens...meanwhile releasing thousands of unvaxxed migrants into the interior of our country...makes me think this sickness is not the threat that we are led to believe...</p>

        <p>Sounds like quite a pickle. Only solution I can see is wide spread segregation and internment camps.</p>

        <p>Have you ever noticed how some small businesses are still requiring masks even as large chains have dropped masks?</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve lost a lot of sympathy for small businesses.</p>

        <p>Congrats for joining the club.</p>
<p>I have maintained from Day 1, and from direct experience that it was in fact Mom and Pop shops first, followed by big chains, who started mandating Masks on their customers - and long before any official government or health mandates - and now some are continuing almost a month after now that they have been lifted.</p>
<p>These businesses, including Edna's Grocery, are continuing to bar access to food/medicine/ essential services if their customers don't wear Masks, because Edna is scared, or is using her clout as an 'essential business' to affect political change or Pro-Vax mentality in her city.</p>
<p>It is unfair, it is unethical and is immoral.. to stop people getting food so you can further your own aims or serve your own fears.</p>
<p>This is typical though. Throughout history, businesses have been the 'tip of the spear' when it comes to changing society - what better way then to hold food and medicine ransom from certain villainized groups.. Like in 1930's Germany. Without businesses being the eyes and ears, the Snitches, and segregating people based on their racial group or other, Hitler would have had a far harder time.</p>

        <p>It would also be much too tempting to have those vaccines go to waste, and they might still keep them in circulation anyway, or sell them off to a desperate 3rd world country ...</p>
<p>I don't trust these buggers one bit.</p>
