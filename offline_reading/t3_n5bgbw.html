        <p>Full article:</p>
<p>When the coronavirus pandemic began, Isabel Díaz Ayuso was known as a gaffe-prone leader who had taken support for the conservative Popular Party (PP) in Madrid to a worrying low.</p>
<p>Now, despite her government having overseen the highest Covid death toll among Spain’s regions amid often chaotic healthcare management, Ms Díaz Ayuso scored a handsome victory in Tuesday’s snap Madrid regional election, winning close to 45 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>Styling herself as the “freedom” candidate, Ms Díaz Ayuso pitched the snap election - which she called on mere suspicion that a coalition partner was considering a manoeuvre against the PP - as a fight against the Left-wing national government of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and its months-long application of pandemic emergency powers.</p>
<p>“There are two models: the Chavista Caracas or Madrid; communism or freedom,” the 42-year-old Ms Díaz Ayuso announced last week at a rally in the blue-collar suburb of Alcorcón, a fiefdom of Prime Minister Sánchez’s Socialist party.</p>
<p>Ms Díaz Ayuso has promised to lead a rebellion against possible tax rises by Mr Sánchez’s Left-wing coalition, just as she has done against Covid restrictions. Last autumn Ms Díaz Ayuso faced off with Mr Sánchez when the central government ordered that her region be sealed off from the rest of Spain for non-essential travel as the virus’s second wave took root in Madrid.</p>
<p>It has not always looked like the pandemic would see her fortunes turn around. During the first wave of Covid, Ms Díaz Ayuso’s government failed to take action to save more than 6,000 care home residents from dying in a matter of weeks. Three-quarters of the dead were denied hospital treatment.</p>
<p>When details emerged of a madcap strategy to make care homes able to treat patients like hospitals, using a single team from a private company, the disaster looked like it might devour the conservative politician.</p>
<p>At that time, Ms Díaz Ayuso was already a figure of fun for Left-wing pundits, who had pounced on comments such as how traffic jams in Madrid, one of Europe’s most polluted cities, were part of what made the city so vibrant.</p>
<p>Her critics painted Ms Díaz Ayuso as a privileged apparatchik of the PP, who had worked in the party’s communications department before being selected as candidate for the regional presidency in 2019.</p>
<p>In 2019 under Ms Díaz Ayuso, the PP suffered its worst result in Madrid for more than three decades, winning 22 per cent and shunted into second place by the Socialist party. However, the party still managed to form a government - leading a coalition with liberal Ciudadanos that secured the backing of far-Right Vox.</p>
<p>Mocked by the Left because she used to be the community manager for former PP Madrid President Esperanza Aguirre - a job that included managing the social media accounts of her pet dog – Ms Díaz Ayuso has proved adept at firing back at her opponents.</p>
<p>She has avoided blame for Covid-19 partly because she has managed to make criticism look like a personalised vendetta against her.</p>
<p>“I didn’t invent Covid,” she insists, instead pointing to her defence of Madrid’s freedoms and keeping small businesses alive with the most relaxed restrictions in the country. Posters of Ms Díaz Ayuso have become a common sight behind the bars in Madrid’s watering holes, while t-shirts have gone on sale adorned with her face.</p>
<p>Madrid currently has a seven-day cumulative caseload of 167 per 100,000 inhabitants, the second-highest among Spanish regions after the Basque Country. But, unlike many other areas, bars and restaurants in the capital remain open as normal, until 11pm.</p>
<p>When the overtly feminist parties of Spain’s Left criticise her, Ms Díaz Ayuso retorts that they reveal their hypocrisy in hating the fact that she, a woman, freely chooses the Right side of the political spectrum. She has a knack of saying what many others might be thinking but do not wish to enunciate, describing the deaths of pensioners in care homes as “inevitable”, and accusing Left-wing Podemos leader of “making a song and dance” about receiving a death threat letter.</p>
<p>What Ms Díaz Ayuso’s popularity has also done is to destroy support for Ciudadanos, which won zero seats, meaning she will probably have to rely on Vox for a majority in Madrid’s assembly. Her assault on Spain’s Left-wing government has stolen Vox’s thunder to some extent, and the far-Right party will be happy to retain its nine per cent share of the vote from 2019.</p>

        <p>Id love to hear more from Spain. Last I catched was the impression that the rural areas and traditional strongholds were far more lax in covid restrictions, but the progressive and urban regions, especially in the north, were more covid restrictive. I believe they even recently had a law that masks must be worn in nature parks??</p>

        <p>in the Netherlands there were elections 3 months ago. The biggest winners were the liberals (classical liberals) who are known for their support of Great Reset and EU.. Only one party questioned lockdowns in its entirety and they did ok but did not win.</p>

        <p>But Great Reset is full socialism. You will own nothing and be happy. Liberals are defenders of private ownership of capital and resources.</p>
<p>Someone has a boatload of cash, starts a factory/service, people get hired to work, get paid and buys things they like and need. Like a house or a car. After the reset, only conglomerates will own property because people will get foreclosed on. Like small business owners in Canada. Easy target.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. I like the concept with free movement of people. But super strict about how they come, they must get the right documents before they come. But that should be fairly easy. And when they come, they will have no rights to anything. Got sick? Hope you have insurance. In need of welfare? You have a country you are citizen in. Committed a crime? Back to sender.</p>
<p>And then we have refugees. The real ones who run away from persecution. Every country could take a few. We can afford some.</p>
<p>Socialists want to rescue everyone. Did you know that Sweden throw out experts in much needed professions and the far left hold demonstrations to keep rapists?</p>

        <p>Free but not unconditional. Mass migration is another beast. Migration under strict responsibility are rarely a problem because if you don't pay your own way, you get sent home. A problem is underpayment of migrants, some work for pennies, but if you can't show that you can pay for living, you're out. </p>
<p>The problem is free everything for people with bad intents. It pulls people in and they live comfortably doing either nothing or having a criminal lifestyle. Without a successful law enforcement, migration is impossible. And with a police force putting down all energy on citizens and mostly honest people leaving the criminal migrants pretty much alone, that's a recipe for disaster. Bending knee for people who wants to destroy our society is insanity. And they do. Not sending them out because "they will be mistreated" if they return to their birth country. Like being imprisoned for crimes they committed before they migrated.</p>
<p>A Russian man shot a policeman and Russia wanted him back for his punishment. Sweden actually said no because prisons in Russia are not like comfortable 3-star hotels like in Sweden.</p>

        <p>No, you don't get the point. If you don't give benefits or "free everything", only the specialists and occasional hard working tradesmen and farmhands come.</p>

        <p>Youre the one not getting the point. A country should be more than just a market place. And if you attract only high skilled migrants you still put certain native people out of work. And then we havent even talked about cultural problems. 
You do show that both libertarianism and communism only look at countries as a collection of booty to be used. Not as the home of a certain people.</p>
