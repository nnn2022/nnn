    <strong>The silver lining to COVID for me...</strong>
    <p><p>So for a lot of people this has been an awful year. And it hasn't really been sunshine and rainbows for me either, but in despair one can find hope. I'm a veteran, and haven't used much of my GI Bill, and wasn't really planning to. But then, in Sept, after the "layoff stipulations" of the PPP loan the company I worked for expired, I lost my job. Luckily I qualified for unemployment, and only took about a 20% pay cut. I spent almost more time per day searching for work than I did actually working when I had a job.</p>
<p>Nothing was panning out, because no one was hiring (at least in fields I was qualified for). Being former LE, I even looked into applying for a federal LE job (such as ICE or CBP). Then, I saw CBP was hiring pilots and the hour requirement was around 750... This led me down a rabbit hole that would change my life.</p>
<p>I had initially joined the Army to fly helicopters, and due to deployments and various other missions and taskings my unit faced, this plan was derailed. I thought I would never get to live my dream. Then I went down the rabbit hole previously stated and found a university that would allow me to use my GI Bill and get me an AAS in aviation, a private pilot license in rotary wing, commercial license, instructor, instrument and instrument instructor ratings. And it's only one state over from where I live. I did the research, leg work, and everything required and I start ground school in two weeks. So maybe covid and getting laid off from my job isn't the worst thing possible. Hopefully my story inspires some of you to keep faith and know good can still happen, even if there are overbearing orders from awful governors and heaps of negativity from doomers.</p>
<p>TL;DR: covid restrictions caused me to get laid off, but I got accepted into helicopter flight school using my GI Bill.</p></p>

        <p>I am one of the lucky ones. I was only off work from mid March till mid June. I was able to spend lots of time bonding with my daughter and only missed a few months of work.</p>
<p>All on all I have wonderful memories breaking the law and going to beaches and parks.</p>
<p>I know the story isn't the same for everyone but I am grateful for the times that we had. Silver lining for sure.</p>

        <p>Nice!  I'm glad to hear it worked out well for you- nice to hear some good news for a change.</p>
<p>You will need to decide, though- will you make your dramatic entrance to "Ride of the Valkyries" or "Long Tall Sally"?  Or perhaps a combination of the two?</p>

        <p>Ohhh, tough choice right there. Probably "Long Tall Sally" as that's a movie from my childhood and I really wasn't exposed to Col Kilgore until my mid-teens.</p>
