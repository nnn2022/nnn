    <strong>Covid restrictions are allowing cover for people with bad intentions</strong>
    <p><p>You know the saying, "sunshine is the best disinfectant". That's the basis of Florida's "Sunshine Laws", which allows the public to view court proceedings to make sure everything is "on the up and up". This idea can be applied to everything. When schools, day cares, courts, hospitals, nursing homes, etc arent letting family and others to oversee operations, shady shit can, and will happen. Even people who don't think they are doing anything bad still act different when they are being watched. </p>
<p>I hate to use this as an example, because I don't want this to turn partisan, therefore divisive, but poll watchers were not allowed to have meaningful access to do their jobs in the 2020 election. </p>
<p>It's come out by whistleblowers within hospitals &amp; nursing homes that family not being able to observe care, most likely was a contributing factor to many deaths. </p>
<p>And who the hell knows what's going on in places where kids are involved. Will a toddler even be able to point out an abuser since everyone has a mask on? That sure makes it convenient for a perpetrator. 
[I'm not saying toddlers aren't smart. Yes, I know they recognize voices, but the mask makes it easier to cover up most of the face, therefore giving the perp plausible deniability if accused].</p>
<p>In the past, sensitive businesses that were more prone to get robbed like gas stations, banks, pharmacies, pain management and methadone clinics, etc did not allow someone inside if anything was covering their face. I would often see signs at the door of gas stations, particularly around Halloween stating this rule. Now they make people wear a mask. I bet the employees feel vulnerable because of this.</p>
<p>Bad things occur when there is secrecy. Extra cover gives extra protection for criminals.</p></p>

        <p>I think that's part of the plan. We know that govt/elite don't care if our children are abused, they want it. They want a small and victimized population, easier to control.</p>

        <p>This type of behaviour by various public-facing orgs was growing like a bad weed before Karen-o-virus.</p>
<p>Businesses/schools/government offices/hospitals/care facilities all went on a "Zero tolerance for abusing our employees" kick.</p>
<p>What that really meant was <em>"We are going to enforce any arbitrary rule we like, provide you shitty service, and fuck you over. And if you (rightly) complain, we will accuse you of being 'abusive' to our staff and throw you out or call the cops."</em></p>
<p>Now they have CCPvirus as an even better excuse to behave like uncaring robots.</p>

        <p>One of the most insidious aspects of this ordeal has been the banning of visitors from hospitals. Elderly patients are admitted and then isolated <em>with nobody to advocate for them</em>. Then after a few days in the hospital, the family gets the bad news that their relative has died "from covid".</p>
<p>Is that what they died from? Who the hell knows? Nobody has even seen these patients for days except the doctors and their staff. If the hospital determines it's in their best interest to mark deaths as "covid" in order to bring in some extra revenue, who is going to argue? The family that wasn't there to observe anything?</p>
<p>As OP notes--to imagine that shady shit is <em>not</em> happening under these circumstances is the height of naivete.</p>

        <p>What you said is so true. At the top levels all the way to the bottom.</p>
<p>I'm currently being sued by tenants who moved into a property and didn't pay rent for two years. They tore up the property, doing about $150,000 of damage and are suing us for $650,000 for pain and suffering living there. It is an insane situation.</p>
<p>(This is an inherited property.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, California government is sympathetic to them because of "Covid hardship" which they made up. They've painted the house up with graffiti, etc... But the city officials accuse us of racism while initiating the eviction process.</p>
<p>The whole thing is insane. Probably will win in court but -- it's costing us lawyer fees and much stress.</p>
<p>But to your point, these people are using Covid to try to steal my wife's inherited property from her. The home she grew up in. It's unbelievable.</p>
<p>But this sort of thing is happening to MANY small businesses and MANY smalltime landlords.  Everyone feels like it's a one off case happening to them, but it is coordinated and deliberate. It is systemic.</p>

        <p>I know from experiences that my mom had that if you are a landlord, you have very little rights. This is particularly hard on those that have 1 apartment that they are renting out. Landlords of mega complexes can afford when they get a rotten apple, but someone with only 1-2 properties needs that money for taxes. It's absolutely being used as an excuse for bad behavior.</p>

        <p>The whole situation is surrounded by secrecy.  The facts aren't apparent, it's not confirmed where the virus came from, policies are being put in place that don't make sense. The whole pandemic is a total exaggeration but people are believing it's not so they don't have to ask the questions.  It is strange for me that people are so complacent and I have realized that it is actually very difficult most to stand up and go against the grain.</p>

        <p>School are ban parents from entering the building and even if you can they have whole processes and steps to get inside. This is like a cult with the mask and how they defend each other.  Walmart making there employees to require the mask and demand from clients,  I told the employee no thanks and his like required..I screamed I don't care..refuse to shop any place requiring masks "the great reset" the sheep will die first by the vaccines and we warned them.</p>
