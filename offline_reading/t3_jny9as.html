    <strong>Parents of sick babies in Poland are being prohibited from visiting their children in certain hospitals</strong>
    <p><p>I thought I would share this, because I am finding out a lot of unexpected ways that these lockdowns and restrictions are affecting people through this sub, so this is another one of those... A few weeks ago I stumbled upon stories of women from Poland who have or have had their babies in the NICU, and they were completely prohibited from seeing their children because of COVID restrictions in certain hospitals. The extent of the restrictions is up to the executive directors of the hospitals so this is not even necessary by law!</p>
<p>One heartbreaking story in particular came from a woman who had her 6-month old son with critical stage heart disease in the NICU, and she was prohibited from seeing him for 6 WEEKS! She would only have the „privilege” of phone calls with the nurse who was taking care of him at the time - she specified „if it was an empathetic nurse, I’d get a picture and she’d tell him that mommy loves him, that he’s the bravest kid in the world, that he doesn’t have to fight anymore. If it was a not-so-empathetic nurse I would only get „no changes, he digests, no poop”.” Eventually, she managed to be able to see him for the last 14 minutes of his life - AND SHE STILL HAD TO FIGHT FOR THAT! Do these people not realize that the presence of parents has a therapeutic effect on children’s health, wellbeing and recovery? Does the miniscule threat of spreading a mild respiratory virus justify separating parents from their sick children, in some cases robbing them of the little time they had together, the ability to draw closure from and grieve these - ALREADY traumatic enough - experiences? Does it justify putting children and babies through the trauma of complete, forced separation from their parents? </p>
<p>The new normal kills humanity. Literally and figuratively.</p></p>

        <p>Public hospitals were bad enough. But now they have been transformed into prison cells. I wouldn't go anywhere near.</p>

        <p>Old colleague of mine wasn’t allowed to see her daughter for over 6 months - her daughter had a tragic accident about 8-ish years ago and needs full-time care. They finally allowed her in and I was in tears reading it.</p>

        <p>Parents were separated from newborns in the US per CDC guidelines as well, it happened to a family member of mine and an NICU nurse tell me it happened occasionally in my little town as well. CDC policy has been updated since then and their previous policy of separation has been memory-holed.</p>
