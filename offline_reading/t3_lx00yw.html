    <strong>I'd like to hear what you guys think about this.</strong>
    <p><p>So, Mississippi and Texas are opening and ending the unconstitutional fake "mandates" they had no power to put in place to begin with. Don't get me wrong, that's great. But something's been bothering me about it. </p>
<p>Why did they decide to end them? I always hear that the government will never willingly give us our rights back, that we will have to win them back and then the government will pretend they were going to give them back all along.  I completely agree with that, because if a leader isn't a tyrant, they wouldn't have put these crazy and unconstitutional measures in place at all. If they do put these unconstitutional mandates in place, it's obvious they are a tyrant, so why would they give the people their freedom back which wasn't even theirs to take in the first place?</p>
<p>I'm just confused at why this is happening because it just doesn't make sense for the tyrants who took people's freedom are just like "Nevermind, here's your freedom back!" </p>
<p>Even if they did "have a change of heart" (which I highly doubt) it still doesn't change the fact that they inflicted an unconstitutional freedomless hell on their people and they deserve to pay for it and not just get away with it. They acted tyrannically, even if they aren't tyrants anymore. Like if a murderer feels bad about it. Good that they turned themselves around, but it doesn't change that they killed someone. </p>
<p>Another bad thing is that since our rights were stripped from us, it's just plain unacceptable for the ones who took them from us just give them back, because that sets a precedent that they can take our rights whenever they please, and give them back whenever they please, like for "climate lockdowns," or some crap. </p>
<p>They are the ones who took our freedom from us. <em>We</em> need to be the ones to take them back. And I can't imagine a dystopian  future where people still remember us as the "crazy people" because that means society hasn't learned anything and we will live at the mercy of our leaders. </p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>Biden is in power. DeSantis Star is rising in the Republican Party. There had to be something these govs saw that said they can have a stronger future in the Repub party if they open states. DeSantis weathered the storm and showed the apocalypse won’t happen if you stay open. Basically the Repub party is slowly turning into the anti-lockdown opposition party. This is a good thing.</p>

        <p>Mate, I don't live in the states so I clearly don't have first hand knowledge of the situation over there, but I believe that politicians are pretty much the same kind of parasites everywhere and they all think alike. Their first objective is to get reelected, and thus they only push their agenda as far as the electorate is willing to swallow it. They do their polling and when they realize they went too far, they let go. Deceptively simple, but that's how it works</p>

        <p>There was a post on here about a week ago that basically said, "They will never give you your rights back willingly. The only way to get them back is to start ignoring the mandates, then the government will have to back off. Then they will say, 'We were always planning on lifting the lockdowns at around this time anyway'."</p>

        <p>Beautifully said. I’ve also been skeptical about this. It probably has to do with the fact that something worse might be in the works and if the states won their freedom back, they’ll push a passport or something that will limit you in worse ways. Just my opinion though.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've had this thought over the last 24 hours.  Also troubling are the reports that Biden is letting asylum seekers into the country without testing them.</p>

        <p>This makes perfect sense, they are allowing a few openings to give people a taste of the old normal so you remember how it was. They only allow a few states, while other state governors scream “that’s crazy” and Fauci claims “don’t go back to normal so fast”</p>
<p>They will claim a new mutated Corona called Covid-21 which they’ll say is more infectious and deadly. They’ll blame it on states opening to early and claim it was just to soon and it’s spreading all over. More forced harsher lockdowns and BS coming.</p>

        <p>When I point out that they had no rights to break the constitution in the first place, I always hear, "Oh, but they had to, their hands were tied! The federal government would withhold funds and then their entire state would starve, so they had to!"</p>
<p>Let me get this straight. The government is withholding funds from states if they refuse to force unconstitutional "mandates" on their people? If so, why aren't they going after South Dakota? Even in that case, they would still be allowing tyranny.</p>
