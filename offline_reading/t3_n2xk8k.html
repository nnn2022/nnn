    <strong>If those guys at Watergate were never caught, it'd be just another crazy conspiracy theory</strong>
    <p><p>... but it DID happen, didn't it?</p>
<p>So why won't people accept that conspiracies do happen?</p></p>

        <p>If Democrats broke into a Republican office, it would still be labeled as a conspiracy theory to this day, and probably memory holed some time in the 1970's never to be heard of again.</p>

        <p>People wanna believe what gives them the least responsibility and the most privileges. </p>
<p>Or put another slightly controversial way, people are complacent as fuck because they have been living this sheltered life for so long that anything to disrupt it, even if it’s as minor as a traffic jam will cause them mental issues. For things involving government they see the government as the ones who have “allowed” for such a peaceful life to persist and so they rather stay sheep than to even utter a word against the big players in the game. Everyone, if they stopped and looked at it would understand most sane “conspiracy theories” are true, but they don’t because it’s effort, and they want it easy, they don’t even want to question stuff because that requires brainpower. Everyone is going into a vegetative state both in body and mind and covid new world order has exasperated this 300%</p>

        <p>If those guys at Watergate weren't caught this takeover would have been 20 years ago.  </p>
<p>The distrust of government created by Watergate was great for society.  But it didn't last much more than 25 years.</p>

        <p>A big part of it is that a lot of, if not most people depending on where exactly you are, view the government as their mommy and daddy, so they can't fathom that it would do something to intentionally disadvantage or even harm them.</p>
<p>Do you know how many conversations, both online and IRL, I've had that have been stopped by "the government wouldn't do that" or something along those lines? A damned lot of them, I'll tell you. Or even better is what happens when I pull up shitty things Uncle Sam has done (up to and including literal, pre-meditated genocide) and the response will almost invariably be "that was a long time ago, you're just crazy" or something to that effect.</p>

        <p>Events remain in the realm of "conspiracy theories" until they are officially admitted. If someone isn't caught, chances are they aren't going to admit to it. Alex jones has been talking about Jeffrey Epstein and the "Lolita Express" for decades. I remember the first time I heard his name on the news and thinking "oh, I guess this is being admitted to now".</p>
<p>We entered the Vietnam war under false pretenses. The Gulf Of Tonkin incident was not what it was presented as. That whole thing was a lie. At the time they tried to silence people who talked negatively about it. If the Vietnam war was going on now, and someone made a YouTube video claiming that the Gulf Of Tonkin incident was a false flag, it would either be removed from Youtube, or there would be a nice boxed in statement that tells you the official narrative with a link to some government website.  Just like the one that says "The Associated Press has concluded that Joe Biden has won the 2020 presidential election."</p>
