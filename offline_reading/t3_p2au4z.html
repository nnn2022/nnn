        <p>My personal theory for the past 1.5 years is this is an extension of the current cultural interest in BDSM. There‚Äôs a huge portion of the population that now believes control and power dynamics are sexual. A ton of them are into being submissive to an authority figure, those are of course masked people. And we have the Karen‚Äôs and politicians and cops etc who enjoy controlling others behavior and are probably getting quite the thrill out of it all. Fucking weirdos the lot of them.</p>

        <p>An acquaintance of mine occasionally posts their texts with their SO that are related to their involvement in BDSM. Nothing terribly explicit but it‚Äôs enough that it‚Äôs obvious what it‚Äôs about. I remember wondering when this got to be so mainstream that people feel comfortable posting it for people they know in real life to see, as if we might actually have some kind of interest in knowing about it.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs the best thing to do with it, wipe that degeneracy from your mind. I have a few friends who are into it and one who‚Äôs entire life is dominated (pun intended) by this wack lifestyle. I try to put it out of my mind, but they continually flaunt their sexual life in public and online. I don‚Äôt want to know about anyone‚Äôs sex life to be frank, not exclusive to weird kinks, please people shut up about your sex no on wants to know.</p>

        <p>There's these liberal types who literally talk about nothing except sex. They are the most boring people on the planet. And I've been single for a while so when I don't have any sexploits to share in return they either mock me or act like I'm stuck up for showing disinterest in sex. As someone who is obsessed with semen retention, It's very hard to talk to these people. They can't fathom that I feel better off retaining than I would if I had pointless one night stands.</p>

        <p>I personally don't doubt covid is a virus that can be lethal, the original comment didn't mention it either. But giving the vaccines to those who already had covid and healthy younger people when the long term side effects are unknown and some severe short term side effects is wrong.</p>
<p>Forcing medical treatment all together is a complete disregard for bodily autonomy and the way it is being done by restricting access to society based on that condition is sickeningly cruel.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs like the flu, sad but the old,obese, smokers, underlying conditions have always died from the flu. Yes some young and healthy too. If you look at the data and compare they are almost the same. I fell for the media hype at first and it never felt like they were being honest and my spidey sense flaired up. Looking into this woke me up. It was always my choice to get a flu shot and it should be my choice to get an EUV shot too. I‚Äôm not high risk for dying from the flu so I don‚Äôt get a shot. My parents and grandparents all did when they got over 75. I‚Äôll do the same.</p>

        <p>Yeah I generally agree with yor sentiment here. I do understand that it's a new virus and the risk is higher. I know here it's recommended you don'tget the flu shot unless you are at risk, this is usually done to reduce the pressure on the virus to mutate to survive. This is similar to bacteria but viruses mutate far faster due to how fast their genetic cycles are. Just a question what's an EUV shot?</p>

        <p>Emergency use vaccine aka covid shot. It‚Äôs only approved as that now as it should take 7-10 years to get FDA approval but it‚Äôs now looking like it will be a forced FDA approval
by this September. Which will be pretty record setting for the FDA. Scary since they have just a great track record with drugs that are FDA approved.</p>

        <p>Ahh okay yeah i know. I don't understand how that can actually work since they haven't done the long term testing for it to be approved. I'm not from the US so hopefully that shouldn't effect me. Plus where I am there is a significant scope for exemptions and you don't even need to explain your exemption just that you have it.</p>

        <p>Holy shit I‚Äôm moving where you live! Where is that if you don‚Äôt mind? Things here are uprising mostly in the bigger cities. Kids in schools have it pretty rough. It‚Äôs a cluster f#*k. I dont live in a big city but I live in NY state near Buffalo. So pretty far removed from
NYC. It‚Äôs a nanny state here. They want to control you . Not that they can but it feels that way. But this whole covid thing has really gone mad . It just came out that phizer made a deal with a lot of the governments around the world that they would not be liable for anything vaccine related for 10 years. Which is crazy. I think it was just leaked this past week. But of course MSM isn‚Äôt mentioning it. But I stay away from that garbage anyway.</p>

        <p>Yeah I saw the leak as well, Albanian government deliberately leaked the example contract from Israel they were shown. Weirdly enough the UK is where I live. I think they may end up changing it or enforcing it in a different way. The passes for large events hasn't even reached parliament and I'm actually starting to believe it won't get through due to rebellion within the government majority. Although that also relies on some of the smaller opposition parties also voting against it which with covid they haven't always done.</p>

        <p>Wow from what the news says in the MSM is the opposite of what your saying. Your county‚Äôs people protesting this has obviously been a game changer! The people here in the US are not protesting as much which is sad makes me cringe. I live in the country so things here are so different than in the big cities. My governor just resigned. It‚Äôs a joke here. But seeing hat people in the parliament don‚Äôt even want the vaccines! I think our own government officials high up don‚Äôt want them either. So that should tell us all something!</p>

        <p>Seen several articles showing that they may struggle to get it through the commons and even if it does there would be legal precident for the lords to block it. The PM himself said back in January that you can't force someone to have a vaccine, coercion counts as force and limiting peoples access to goods and services is coercion. I mean yeah idk why Cuomo was revoted in, ig because party allegiance? I'm from a country area but live in a major city. Ngl here rn life is completely back to normal now.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs awesome that your county has common sense and morals and knows that the laws were put their to protect people. NY state will always have a democratic governor. No republican can have a chance. It‚Äôs the NYC voters just how it works here . Big cities alway vote democratic and the rest of the country the opposite. Where I live it feels like nothing has changed here. Watching the news however will a cate the crap out of you. Local or MSM. No one wearing masks here. 5 deaths in my county since day 1. Nursing home deaths. People don‚Äôt look at the whole
Picture. The People here in the US are spoiled and don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to fight for what they have. The last couple of generations anyway. Parents gave them everything and never taught them to think for themselves. That‚Äôs my take anyway. My grandmother used to say she saw this coming and was scared to see the outcome. She didn‚Äôt want to be around to see it unfold. She was British! Smartest woman I ever knew. Depression and Ww11 survivor and her husband was a POW while she was pregnant with my mom. She knew what we went through to have freedoms. Sorry I am venting but this makes me so upset as I have such respect for her and I know all of this would kill her . Thank god she isn‚Äôt around to see this.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's understandable with the voter thing, fairy similar here but often around regionality although that seems to have broken down which I think is healthy. The thing is we have a really high vaccination rate, I respect those people's choices even if I disagree with them. Whilst I know the history of my countries and the abhorrent catastrophies we've unleashed in the past on the rest of the world it does seem like maybe we learnt a lot along the way, although honestly who can tell. </p>
<p>As a nation we have a huge amount of issues to sort out and I can't see the current government doing that, luckily the conservative party is always very good at argueing against itself. The unfortunate thing is imo good governance requires competition and to be challenged by the opposition and right now the other parties don't seem to be doing that. Ig i'm lucky previous governments enshrined the Nuremberg with legal backing rather than just signing up to it. Ig it can get overturned but I hope it doesn't, would be a shame to stand up defiantly against facism only for it to take hold only a couple of generations later. We essentially lost our footing as global super power (admittedly already waning at the time), countless historical buildings and towns and a hell of a lot of people for the freedoms afforded to us from our history and traditions. </p>
<p>I think America built on those traditions and a lot of the similar traditions are there. I think a 2 party state is a dumb idea but I dislike the notion of politcal parties anyway but recognise their neccessity. I hope the american people and my own recognise and defend/argue their case.</p>

        <p>I completely agree with you 100%. Nothing is perfect but we are fortunate to live in places where we still have rights. We try here to have other parties get elected. Independent, libertarian for example. But the $$ that backs the dem and rep party is sick! Big corporations and pharmaceuticals mostly! I sometimes feel like the purse strings are being pulled by someone much higher up. Sounds conspiracy theory , I know . Maybe I don‚Äôt have a true understanding of how things go. I try to stay away from it or I‚Äôll get obsessed into it and it will make me crazy!  Like this whole covid-vaccine thing . But that affects my life as well as my loved one so I am very concerned. Power and money are something I never understood, probably because I never had either! Lol I look at that and say why would you want that stress in your daily lives!? Maybe I watch too much TV! Lol  But I do want the power to be able to make my own choices and that‚Äôs why our countries are built on. So I have a hard time believing that they can take that away from us. Looks like your country is much more passionate about keeping their rights than we are here. Maybe it‚Äôs the demographics? We are so spread out here. But time will tell!</p>

        <p>There are powerful people who try to influence government. Honestlyi'd ban corporate donations completely, lobbying is just legalized corruption in my eyes. Have only personal donations and limit the amount, sure people will find loopholes but it's a start.</p>
<p>Eh my job is quite stressful however it gives me an outlet to train my brain on, I enjoy it and I like my colleagues. Maybe it is demographics idk, we do have very large immigrant communties from other cultures that have been here for a while. Many of them have integrated the cultures together and it's very interesting to see. I do think there needs to be more work on how that functions tbh.</p>

Sadly I don‚Äôt see some of it ever changing until the blame goes away and they start to try to be part of society rather than put the blame out there. I understand why but. ‚Ä¶ anyway ‚Ä¶ 
Be thankful you have a job that challenges you and people that do too!!! I was never able to find that. I got bored too easily and without a college education I had limits. Then my children came and I wanted to stay home and raise them. That was my biggest challenge. But they are grown and gone . Grew up to be great thank god. But finding my niche in life ?? I trained horses  and taught kids riding while my daughter was you f because I had that as a kid and wanted to offer it to her. That was fun but burned out. I am a big workout and running freak but age is gonna catch up with me. That keeps me tame for now!!! Hahaha! I just could never understand why anyone would want the job as the president of the United States!??? That‚Äôs too much stress. Thank god someone wants to do it!lol</p>

        <p>That's awesome I grew up in a very horsey part of the UK but was never that big into it but they are beautiful animals. Ig i'm very lucky with my education really, I wish I put more into it at the time and i'm still quite young (maybe even a similar age to your children). I'm just getting back into doing sport and working out. I hate running though unless there is a ball to chase and yes I understand that makes me sound like a dog. </p>
<p>I think there are some people who just lust for power and don't care about the stress of it all if they can impose their will, even if they believe it is for a good reason or cause. Ironically I think the well intentioned who go into those positions always end up corrupted by the power itself.</p>

The first Lockdowns and the stress of losing my grad job that I was about to start (took my a while to find one I really wanted) made me balloon and get a bit to large for my liking.

        <p>Yeah  I hear yah! same here! The lockdowns here did the same for me. Too much wine,cheese and vodka! Lol the weight came fast but taking it off has been slower. The winter here was tough and I for the first time ever didn‚Äôt want to run outside. Hubby bought me an awesome treadmill which for both of us back. Then my gym opened back up. They only do Hiit workouts and required masks, that sucked so bad. But now masks are not required. For now anyway. You will get there I keep telling myself that . Thank for I was way to thin before(so my husband says) I disagree. But I‚Äôm nowhere near where my fitness level was. I thought until we went on vacation and did a measly 20 mile bike ride and my ass hurt for days. Then we hiked up Mt Mansfield and coming down I felt like I was gonna break in two. Just wait when your my age! But I feel like fitness is good for the mind just as much as your body.</p>

        <p>I never said covid didn't exist but it does have a 99,8% survival rate before covid the same amount of people died of the flu and we didn't do anything back then it's almost like it's a excuse for dictatorship, if it's not true that it has 99,8% survival rate I would like you to proof me wrong.</p>

        <p>I totally feel your skepticism dude, don't think I haven't considered the thought myself because I have.</p>
<p>What I'd say however is that we in the UK had roughly 24,000 flu related deaths in 2019/20 in comparison to 170,000 covid related deaths across 2020/21.</p>
<p>Now whilst I'm not knowledgeable enough to prove you wrong and while I also agree on the mortality rate, what I'd urge you to consider is how large a number 0.2% is in regards to population.</p>
<p>In that seemingly small percentile could contain our friends and loved ones. Hell if I'd somehow found out you had gotten ill or even died from this thing that would genuinely hit me like a tonne of bricks.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly what everyone's individual solutions are to this particular problem but I believe the first stepping stone is fully understanding what each side is trying to say.</p>

        <p>The UK counted any death up to 60 days after a positive covid test as a covid death until August 2020 when they changed it to 28 days.</p>

        <p>A lot of people are too occupied with filling their minds with absolute mundane garbage to even bother to learn their history. Before this Covid nonsense, I would often try to seek out people who would be willing to have a conversation about the past, history and just human nature in general. Many of them would reply with something along the lines of ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too dark‚Äù and would change the subject to something more light-hearted.  This is a direct desired result of the NWO‚Äôs education objectives in today‚Äôs society. If you don‚Äôt know where you came from, you won‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going.  To a certain extent it has worked. But I‚Äôm sure the reality of what‚Äôs happening now has woken a good number of people out of their slumber.  At least I would hope so.</p>

        <p>People are blind to the past because they no longer care to learn or know anything about it.</p>
<p>Especially if it's dark, brutal, and shows the worst of human nature.</p>
<p>Also, for anyone commenting here that cries bloody murder about the comparisons being drawn between the Holocaust and Covid-19 related societal engineering such as vaccine passports and public venue restrictions based on vaccination status, I only have two things to say. One, if you're not a Jew, you don't get to cry foul about the comparison. Two, do you really want things to become literally like the Holocaust II before you acknowledge the psyops principles that are equally applicable and arguably the same, be it now or back in the 1940s?</p>

        <p>Come on now. Jews were numbered, imprisoned and slaughtered. I'm pretty sure that pre-lockdown you had minimal complaints about having a social security or national insurance number?</p>
<p>I'm determined to have nice interactions with those whose views oppose mine so please don't let what I've said start an argument instead of a conversation. I'd rather you explain <strong>how</strong> I'm wrong over resorting to the usual arguments we both see every day.</p>

        <p>Agreed.  I'll do my best to explain.</p>
<p>Before being numbered, they had to wear the yellow star of David.  It was designed to separate the Jews from the non-Jews.  Jews were not allowed in many places.  Now, this type of segregation did not start until later years (1939 onwards); hitler came to power in '33.  In other words, it was a gradual forced segregation, following years of demonizing the Jews.  That's how so much evil was committed against Jews, without much complaint from others.</p>
<p>Pre-lockdown, SSN was not used, at least <em>prima facie</em>, to discriminate.  This post has nothing to do with SSN.  It has to do with the gradual forced segregation of people, based on some pathetic descriptor: vaccinated.  As with the antisemitism, the hate against non-vaccinated is cultivated in a gradual fashion.  So, by the time force is used against those not willing to vaccinate, those vaxxed will not bat an eye.</p>
<p>My family went through this before; we were taught never to forget.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve never said that i wanted to go back as before, since march 2020 i‚Äôve always said that there‚Äôs no turning back. What about viruses that existed before covid? Surely theyre some deadly viruses that we needed vaccines, why now with covid? People say that vaccine passport always existed in some sense, so then why create another/new one? Why didnt you have to show proof that you got vaccinated for chickenpox to eat at mcdonalds before covid? I know people who had no vaccines, should have they been removed from their freedom?</p>

        <p>The existence of unvaccinated people does not create vax-resistant mutations. Mass vaccinations are what create that evolutionary pressure. Covid is here to stay and more and more health officials of various countries (like Iceland) are saying natural infection, not endless boosters, is the only way to address the variants.</p>
<p>Plus the vaccines reduce symptoms but don't prevent transmission. If barely symptomatic/asymptomatic vaccinated people are not a threat, then barely symptomatic or asymptomatic uncaccinated people are not a threat either. Segregating them using covid passes is meaningless.</p>
<p>In fact vaccinated people are more likely to have a false sense of security which could lead to greater spread. At least when you're symptomatic, you know you're infected and stay home.</p>

        <p>Mutations can‚Äôt take place unless the virus is freely reproducing. Virus reproduction can only happen during an infection. Vaccines are still somewhere around 85% effective at preventing infections.</p>
<p>&rt; Plus the vaccines reduce symptoms but don't prevent transmission.</p>
<p>Again: only when infections in the vaccinated occur. Vaccines are still remarkably effective at preventing infections from occurring.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>This is a deflection, by the way. You still aren‚Äôt being treated like a Jew under Hitler, no matter how much you try to convince yourself otherwise. Sorry.</p>

        <p>There is no such thing as a "truly free" society. Accepting life in a society means giving up at least a modicum of freedom to receive that society's benefits. Want to be able to murder someone anytime you want? Can't live in a society. Want to sell any drug you'd like? Not if you want access to roads and the internet.</p>

        <p>I love how you immediately jump to extreme answers. ‚ÄúYou support true freedom, so you must want to murder people because not being allowed to is a restriction of freedom!‚Äù</p>
<p>Bad fallacy.</p>
<p>There are such things as morals. Living the life you choose based on sound morals is true freedom. Living an immoral life with no direction at all makes one a slave to their id and appetite</p>
<p>And let me ask‚Ä¶is forcing everyone to not live their lives because you‚Äôre afraid of something a moral action?</p>

        <p>News flash: not everyone has the same moral code. There are those who truly see no moral issue with committing murder or selling methamphetamine or crack openly. For these people, restrictions on their ability to do either constitute suffocating government overreach.</p>
<p>Just because your moral code says it's fine to spread COVID as much as you want, it's not justification to think your moral code is the correct one to which society should bend, any more than it should bend to the whims of sociopaths who think murder is a fine way of resolving conflicts.</p>
<p>&rt;Living an immoral life with no direction at all makes one a slave to their id and appetite</p>
<p>Interesting point, coming from someone who believes he should have the right to flaunt whatever health restrictions he wants, because his freedom trumps anyone else's care for themselves or others.</p>

No one thinks it's morally acceptable to intentionally harm others by giving them covid or anything else.</p>
<p>Other than that you are a pro medical segregationist, and I think that's fascist; and I don't negotiate my rights with fascist sympathizers.</p>

<p>Viruses can only mutate when they reproduce. Reproduction only happens during infections. Vaccines prevent infections at a ~85% effectiveness. Therefore, vaccines prevent new variants. QED.</p>

        <p>First of all as a family member of survivors I usually bristle at these analogies but I think it‚Äôs fair to at least question, hey is this going to a good place? The argument the Third Reich made against Jews was a scientific one promulgated by their Eugenics scientists. They also said Jews spread disease. They said for the scientific safety of the public we have to have segregation. </p>
<p>I would put a question to you, if the danger is non vaccinated people spreading variants why isn‚Äôt the vaccine being given away for free to the third world? Why are israel and Gibraltar with 85% vaccine rates seeing the delta variant spread?</p>

        <p>Lmao I assure you the Third Reich‚Äôs justification for its treatment of Jude was not merely based on scientific principles alone.</p>
<p>In any case, the Jews were a defined group of people outside of their treatment by the Third Reich. Anti-vaxxers are defined entirely by their opposition to the COVID vaccine, not some element of their identity they have no control over. Therefore, the comparison to Jews is invalid. </p>
<p>&rt; if the danger is non vaccinated people spreading variants why isn‚Äôt the vaccine being given away for free to the third world? </p>
<p>Over a billion doses are, with more on the the way. In addition, the danger of variants is only more being realized over the last couple of weeks. Before the spread of Delta, it was assumed the virus‚Äôs danger was essentially over, and vaccinations and masking were less necessary. Not anymore, now that states like Florida are setting their all time hospitalization records and DeSantis has asked Biden for 300 ventilators.</p>
<p>&rt; Why are israel and Gibraltar with 85% vaccine rates seeing the delta variant spread?</p>
<p>85, while still being much higher than 0, is less than 100. Ever looked up exactly how contagious Delta actually is?</p>

        <p>100% vaccinated is impossible, so basically we have to live in medical tyranny forever. Pass. You don‚Äôt really know the history of early third Reich, it was a combination of scientific eugenics mixed with older German anti Semitism. You‚Äôre saying that only a racial non choice is a valid reason not to discriminate. That‚Äôs insanely wrong. When the bolsheviks were killing hundreds of thousands of their political enemies was that ok because they had a choice to not be a Bolshevik. Discrimination is wrong. Period. </p>
<p>Idk where you‚Äôre getting a billion doses but that‚Äôs a lie. Only 1% of third world has received a dose. Where‚Äôs your outrage? Where‚Äôs your anger at companies not giving away the patents? Oh let me guess the media you follow never mentioned it. Because I was reading scientists saying in January if we don‚Äôt open the patent more variants will arise. Face it this isn‚Äôt about getting people vaccinated it‚Äôs about control.</p>

        <p>85 was in reference to the effectiveness of vaccines, not the percentage of those who have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>&rt;mixed with older German anti Semitism</p>
<p>...and you don't see how this makes discrimination against anti-vaxxers different? What's the modern equivalent of the pre-existing anti-Semitism against those who are anti-vaxx?</p>
<p>&rt;When the bolsheviks were killing hundreds of thousands of their political enemies was that ok because they had a choice to not be a Bolshevik.</p>
<p>Then start comparing yourselves to enemies of the Bolsheviks instead of to Jews during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>&rt;Discrimination is wrong. Period. </p>
<p>Society frequently discriminates against others. It discriminates against the poor. It discriminates against those who have committed crimes. Antisocial, selfish behavior has always resulted in negative consequences. That's how social groups work, lol. When you fuck your buddy's wife, do you tell your friend it would be wrong for him to discriminate against you? How about if you act recklessly and get him sick?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/podcast/2021/07/30/-absolutely-unacceptable-vaccination-rates-in-developing-countries-the-development-podcast">Not a lie</a>, and there's plenty of outrage toward the vaccine situation in the developing world.</p>
<p>&rt;Face it this isn‚Äôt about getting people vaccinated it‚Äôs about control.</p>
<p>Right, because it's secretly the dream of every epidemiologist to spend decades of their life doing research on contagious diseases so that one day, they might be able to tell residents of Pensacola, Florida, to wear masks when they go out to Outback Steakhouse to celebrate their anniversary.</p>

        <p>The fact that the goal posts have been moved consistently. Initially it was a 99% effective rate, then it dropped to 95, then to 92 and now, according to you, it's down to 85%. The fact that you still believe these lies from a corporation that has been fined billions of dollars in the last 15 years due to not disclosing side effects shows to me the kind of person you are. The same was done with these vaccines as well. Pericarditis and myocarditis were both added well after this vaccine was widely administered and now my country has also added bells palsy. </p>
<p>If only there was a way to find this information before it's administered to the gen pop.....kinda like a trial run or something.</p>

        <p>I'm copying my comment I posted as a reply to another user. </p>
<p>'I avoid these comparisons myself most of the time. But you have to look at the broader picture here, or at least try to. The Holocaust didn't happen overnight. It also didn't happen because Germans are by default a cruel and evil nation. It happened because people refused to speak up and see the warning signs until it was too late. If you spend some time in any mainstream sub and see a discussion about the so called anti-vaxxers, you'll often notice the other side talking about putting people into camps and advocating for violence. It is now an acceptable opinion to say that you want a certain group of people to suffer and die, or at least lose all of their rights. I've heard news reporters talking about beating us with sticks, a metaphor for taking our rights, I've seen lawyers and twitter blue checks talking about beheading us or going on a shooting spree, and many many many other examples. You have to be a fool to not see where this is going, and, sadly, most people are fools.And before you say we're literally murdering people with our disease carrying breath, think for a moment. Just think. No one has appeared on the TV to say that the vaccinated are unable to get infected and spread the virus. Literally not a single doctor and scientist has said it, and I'm talking mainstream doctors, not 'cranks'. You're not immune. You're protected from a more severe form of the virus but immunity is something no one can promise you. And yet for the majority of the people it is now acceptable to live in a segregated society and the calls for violence don't make them worried at all. They can't draw parallels because they haven't lived under such regime before. 'Nope, can't happen in our lifetime, we're too smart. And even if it happens, it's justified so it's all good.'</p>

        <p>Majority of the tattoo stories are bullshit. For starters why would keep that shit on your arm? Just yesterday an article came up about an 80 year old Holocaust survivor. That would have made them what 4 or 5 at the time. They where at a camp in Treblinka according to the article. The tattoos were ever only given to prisoners in Auschwitz. Surely there wouldn‚Äôt be Jews who could seriously make things up, and if there were surely they‚Äôd fucking the facts straight</p>

        <p>Think you've missed my point entirely there, brother. What I mean is, we're all already number and catalogued. You have a birth certificate, social security number and in most case a drivers license. </p>
<p>Most places you go will have security cameras, you'll use credit/debit cards and you'll use a smartphone. They already have almost every single detail about you and have done since your birth which makes the posters point somewhat redundant.</p>

        <p>This is how an opinion forms with limited information. </p>
<p>It's as if you don't realize nearly all American mass shooters (ooh and there are a lot of them) are/were right-wing kooks who think they are being proactive by shooting groups of whoever. If you recognized that fact, you wouldn't use that as your cudgel against authoritarianism. </p>
<p>You are misguided.  That opponent you have created in your mind has assistance from media that loves selling fear.  What you are saying about an army of aggressive citizens is the right-wing undertone of the Republican party.  So, how you spaghetti noodled your way into thinking the other team is preparing to capture you because of your stupidity is honestly laughable. </p>
<p>Look, you have every right to be cautious about the slippery slope with regard to regulations, but when you start unironically defending against the same myth you created, I just can't  stay silent about your dillusion.</p>
<p>Do you know that your news and that person ypu think wants to put you in a cage gets completely different sources of information?</p>

<p>&rt;It's as if you don't realize nearly all American mass shooters (ooh andthere are a lot of them) are/were right-wing kooks who think they arebeing proactive by shooting groups of whoever.</p>
<p>Cool, but does it apply to Europe and the rest of the world? I'm not informed enough on the gun issues in the USA that you projected on me for no reason, but if you think Europe is some sort of paradise because most people don't have guns, you're very very wrong. Just look at <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15150114/london-stabbings-2021-knife-crime-attacks/">this</a> and tell me if this non violent devoid of guns utopian paradise is working. The people who want guns will obtain guns. And if they don't obtain them, there's knives, axes, acid, hell, even cars. Any vehicle you enter can be used as a killing machine. So uh, what I'm trying to say is that it's a complex issue and I'm not a gun collecting republican or whatever you think I am, I'm just trying to show you a different perspective.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You are misguided.  That opponent you have created in your mind hasassistance from media that loves selling fear.  What you are sayingabout an army of aggressive citizens is the right-wing undertone of theRepublican party.</p>
<p>That American POV again. Hungary, a well known 'right-wing' country, implemented outdoor masking, lockdowns, vaccine passports and has one of the highest rates of vaccination in Europe. Sweden, a left wing paradise, the country that every american leftist gives as a stark example of equality and social justice, treated its citizens like adults and let them decide the level of risk they want to take for themselves.</p>
<p>No media is selling me fear. I observe the language people around me, both in real life and on social media use, I notice the tone they use to talk about people like me on the mainstream media and I make my own conclusions. Right now my conclusion is that a lot of people have been radicalized and I'm not talking about trump and gun loving republicans, especially not here in Europe. I'm talking about ordinary people - neighbours, friends, coworkers. The ones that won't say a word in my defense if tomorrow someone decides to shoot/stab/ram me because of my views on a certain issue.</p>
