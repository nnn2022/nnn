    <strong>Review of my views on the COVID vaccines &amp; Restrictions</strong>
    <p><p>(Pasted post of what I posted onto r/vaxxhappened considering it will probably get deleted there)  </p>
<p>To start off, I am not an anti-science, anti-vax type of person, as I believe that with science, you can do just about anything, if you follow the scientific methods and principles which we have created as a species. However, with the COVID vaccine, this is different. So, I will be supplying a list of reasons as to why I don't believe you should get the COVID vaccine if you are offered to take it, or pressured into taking it from a workplace.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pfizer, Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, and several other vaccine distributors have had issues in the past regarding the legitimacy of their trials, and the safety of their tests. Here is an article from 2014 regarding this - <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/bigpharma#:~:text=Sept%202009%20Pfizer%20was%20fined%20%242.3%20billion%20%2C,United%20States.%20Pfizer%20pled%20guilty%20to%20misbranding%20the">Big Pharma’s Big Fines (propublica.org)</a></li>
<li>These vaccine were rushed, and do not the approval in which it would have been required in a non-pandemic situation to be released to the public. No COVID vaccine has a full-use FDA approval behind it to back up it's safety and legitimacy, only an "Emergency Use Authorization," meaning that it does not meet the FDA's strong guidelines for safety, and is being used only as a method to calm the public and give a potential solution.</li>
<li>Many of these vaccines will have long term effects, and will require annual booster shots to keep their effectiveness up. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/04/23/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-updates-booster-shots-eu-supplies/?sh=36c74ccdad78">Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine Updates: Booster Shots, E.U. Supplies (forbes.com)</a></li>
<li>The Virus isn't as deadly as it is made out to be. Many deaths were falsely reported, as the virus has a 99.7% survival rate. 95% of these deaths have comorbities, and the average age of death is the average life expectancy, 78. The vaccine to the virus also has little effect, and this has been said even by health officials, the only effect it has is that you <em>may</em> get less sick from the virus if you catch it after being vaccinated.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few reasons as to why many people are refusing the COVID vaccine, along with me. And to shed some light as to the views and opinions (<strong><em>cOnSPirAcy ThEoRiEs</em></strong> as you like to call them), here is the merit and explanation behind them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Most governments never truly care about the health of their citizens. If they did, insulin, cancer treatments, etc, would be free or very cheap. So some people are a little suspicious when the government is all of a sudden offering them rewards if they go and get a shot.</li>
<li>The Government (The US at least) has been trying to infringe on their peoples basic rights, and the media has assisted this by using common, basic fear tactics to help coerce the population along into this. Pressuring people into doing things and giving up their basic rights tends to be frowned upon by a lot of the people who tend to fight for their rights.</li>
<li>Masks have little to no effectiveness. Texas for example has been 100% open for weeks now, and never saw the spike in cases that was predicted by many experts and media outlets. Approximately 30% of the nation is vaccinated (Most likely less considering the average political stance on the vaccine in Texas), so assuming best case scenario of 30% vaccination rates in Texas, that does not meet the 70% that experts suggested would be required as a minimum for a herd immunity to take place.</li>
<li>Media fear mongering during the entire pandemic. As seen in the graph below, the reported deaths are nowhere as world endingly serious as the media makes them out to be. This is generally seen as fear mongering to most people.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are just a few of the things that this situation has brought forth. There are many more details and views, some good, some bad. Many of which not many can agree upon, but these are some empirical facts which may hope to shed some lights on some of my views, and others who share my views.</p></p>

        <p>Glad to hear it, I believe that this is the best case scenario for a lot of people, obviously some people who are at a very old age and high risk should consider getting it as they won't really need to worry about long term effects (statistically speaking at least), but almost everyone who is getting the shot is taking in a huge risk that they are getting pressured into, over something they don't understand.</p>

        <p>Agree with you... I also have to say I will never qualify my reasons or rationale for not wanting with ever again by declaring that I am not an anti vaxxer or anti science. Fuck anyone who dares to call another person these terms as a shaming tactic. I don't care what they think of me anymore. When they start the insults I am done.</p>

        <p>Additionally now that things are starting to open up more there is even more pressure on people to get vaccinated. My work has issued a policy that if you are vaccinated you do not have to wear a mask but if you are not fully vaccinated you have to wear a mask. Now everyone can clearly see who is vaccinated or not. They may not say it outloud but if your not then your labeled as an "anti-vaxer".</p>
