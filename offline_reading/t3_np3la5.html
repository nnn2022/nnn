    <strong>Vaccinated percentage and pharmas plausible deniability</strong>
    <p><p>In all experiments I conducted during my university study both a control and test group were created. The formulation of these groups was carefully picked to ensure a valid experiment. </p>
<p>Since these vaccenes are still accumulating data and many countries are mandating upwards of 80% compliance the control group becomes almost worthless. </p>
<p>If there is a huge adverse reaction later on would pharma be able to plausible deny the vaccene  as root cause since any excuse such as "environmental pollution" or "Food related preservatives" virtually anything could be hypothesized without a control group?</p></p>

        <p>Typically, a clinical trial excludes any other experimental agent besides the one they are testing. When the covid vaccines were authorized, this became a big problem for all other trials - technically, vaccinated people would be excluded if we kept the language the same. We wouldn't be able to enroll other trials; enrollment is already a challenge and to exclude such a large group would basically mean a halt or very long and costly extension of everything out there.</p>
<p>FDA allowed trials to decide to include vaccinated people, as long as separate statistical analysis was included. So a very large number of other trials for other conditions will be completing statistical analysis of their main treatment but also of the vaccines.</p>
<p>It's my hope that in a couple years, these will be very valuable to see impacts of the vaccine if they are there, because we are missing some real opportunities now. But I don't know how or if any of those results will be released to the public, because they kinda just do what they want these days, it seems.</p>
