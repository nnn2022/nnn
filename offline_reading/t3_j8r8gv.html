        <p>This video begins with a lie - "The earth cannot handle the sheer number of humans who live here".  This is completely untrue. Why is there starvation in Africa?  It's not because they can't grow food.  There is more than adequate land, sunshine and water in sub-Saharan Africa. The problem is politics and war.  Zimbabwe and Botswana used to produce vast amounts of food for the whole of Africa and the world, but because of evil governments they now need handouts.  The earth could sustain billions more people easily.</p>

        <p>Africa has other problems.</p>
<p>Way too much intervention from rest of the world. I was reading about the Hutu Tutu massacre in Rwanda, how the two were living in peace for 500 years, until the Belgian colonization. The invaders purposely fanned the flames of hatred between the two by propaganda through the education system.</p>
<p>500 years of peace ruined by 50 years of propaganda. The manufactured violence caused by that was worse than the massacres committed by the Nazis, and Japanese towards the Chinese during WWII. Sure the numbers may have been higher, but the sheer violence, man. It was neighbour against neighbour, families against families, friends against friends.</p>
<p>Also the charity organizations and celebrities that send them food there. Don't trust their intentions. One of them sent bunch of shoes, which caused local businesses to collapse. Which meant they had to be reliant.</p>

        <p>It was years ago I read, I don’t know if it was an article, or just a random post on some random message board, but they went in depth on why depopulation wasn’t good. What would happen to the economy on a micro and macro level if there were less and less people every year. As a person who believed overpopulation was the end of the world, I never once considered the alternative.</p>

        <p>Agenda 21 and the Great Reset includes propaganda against population growth and climate change. The real goal is to divide the population so distract them from what the elites are really doing, and to create havoc.</p>
<p>Both are nonsense.</p>
<p>Population naturally stops increasing when the density reaches a certain level. In Japan and Korea its projected to seriously drop, because the problems due to insane population density causes its citizens to basically turn crazy, which reduces population.</p>
<p>Most of the issue regarding population actually has to do with waste. If people actuallly conserved...</p>
<p>Global Warming is another propaganda. Solar/Wind/Hydro are not as clean as they make it out to be, its way too expensive, and unsightly. Wind is the worst, Hydro the second, Solar only works for emergency scenarios when the power goes out for an extended period. Wind and Hydro can actually be quite destructive for the native habitat.</p>
<p>Research into fossil fuel and gas power plants not only provide more jobs, its pollution far more manageable to deal with.</p>

        <p>The elites running and supporting this Agenda want to decrease the population <em>dramatically</em>, they have a method or formula of some kind that extends life to like 150 or something, not making this up. </p>
<p>They want to enjoy the earth and all it has to offer without dealing with the ‘peasants’. They want all their holiday locations private and pristine. They literally want to own the world. I know it’s irrational but irrational people are the ones doing this.</p>
