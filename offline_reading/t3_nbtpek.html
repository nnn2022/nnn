    <strong>Confessions from a college student</strong>
    <p><p>Over the past summer, I completely ignored all COVID guidelines and had possibly one of the best summers of my life. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Things I did would get me banned from most subreddits:</p>
<p>-sharing the same joint with my friends </p>
<p>-sharing the same pen</p>
<p>-drinking out of the same bottle</p>
<p>-sharing a bed with a friend </p>
<p>-walking around in public with no mask</p>
<p>-being in the packed car with no masks</p>
<p>-having 7-10 people a small room for hours at a time (with no ventilation ðŸ˜¨)</p>
<p>-talking to brand new people standing an arms length away from me with no mask</p>
<p>-travelled by plane more than 3 times for recreational purposes </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, the summer job I have involves mentoring and teaching kids aged 5 to 14. <strong>We had over 1,000 kids come through our camp. Not a single one caught COVID-19.</strong> The ONLY person to catch COVID was a co-workers sibling (who didn't even work for us lol). </p>
<p>COVID is an overblown joke. Out of everyone I know who is around my age, only 2 people got COVID, and recovered in a few days. No young children got COVID despite them being in a summer camp and being in close contact with each other for hours a day. I go about my daily life and COVID is worry or think about.. until I go to social media and I am flooded with COVID-everything. It's a joke. Wake the fuck up. </p>
<p>What happened to the world? Get out and have some fun. Take some vitamin D (or better yet, sit in the sun for 20 minutes a day), Zinc, and don't be an obese pig. Put down the phone and go outside and you'll see life is fine.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Fight the good fight. It's not you vs. me. It's the common people vs. the 0.001%!</strong></p></p>
