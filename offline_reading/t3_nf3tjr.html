    <strong>Other than under 12 year olds, is there anyone they are telling not to get the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>So we keep hearing that we must get the vaccine for the sake of those who can't get it.  But who are they telling not to get it other than those under 12 who have almost no risk from covid?  I looked and what they are saying is if you have an allergy to components in the vaccine, don't take it.  But aren't the components all new?  Who would have a known allergy to new stuff?  For others like pregnant, lactating, those with autoimmune issues, the frail, those with history of anaphylaxis, they are telling them to consult with their doctor.  But everyone I know who has any such situation is being pressured by their doctors to take it anyway, some are being told to bring their epipen just in case!  So I know one person with history of anaphylaxis and one with severe lupus and they are both being heavily pressured to get the arm poke.  Another is in the middle of radiation and hormone treatments for cancer and they are pressuring him to get the poke as well!  I have not heard of anyone on earth who is being told not to get it by the mainstream other than those under 12 (and you can pretty much bet those will soon be on the list as well)  The only other person they are telling to not get the shot (yet) are those who currently have covid, so they are told to wait until they are recovered and THEN get it, so those peeps do not really count since they are just postponed (and they'd have natural immunity anyway).</p>
<p>So if 'vaccine hesitant' are being told they have a duty to get the arm poke for the sake of 'those that can't get the vaccine themselves,' what people are they referring too if everyone is being pressured to get it regardless?  Am I missing some group?  (note that 'consult with doctor' advice seems to always lead to being told to get it unless your doctor is more holistic and risking loss of license if they tell you no)</p></p>

        <p>Not at all, I am just seeing if I missed anything before I start using this argument more often.  I like to gather evidence to check my accuracy.  And so far I have not seen anyone even in conspiracy circles bring up this little tidbit of apparently illogical arguing they are doing, despite it becoming an almost daily mantra of the brainwashed.  It would be nice to have an accurate and effective counter defense against this argument they are using.  So far I have used my counter to it several times and it has totally and utterly shut down all responses against me.  It seems they have not come up with a defense for this one yet, heh.  ;-P</p>

        <p>So you have a source for the first?  All I see is them saying 'consult with your doctor' and then the doctor tells them to just bring an epipen with them and get it anyway.   "If you’ve had an immediate allergic reaction to an infused or injectable medication — such as a biologic for an inflammatory or autoimmune disease — the CDC says you should consider it as a precaution and discuss it with your doctor before getting either the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine."  For the second one, how many peeps would know if they are allergic to the ingredients of a vaccine that has never been used on humans before?</p>
