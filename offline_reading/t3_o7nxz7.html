    <strong>Up to 40% of vaccination appointments in Germany are missed or canceled</strong>
    <p><p>As "Die Zeit", a left-authorian newspaper is reporting, up to 40% of the dates are cancelled are no-shows. Some examples.</p>
<p>Berlin:</p>
<p>&rt;The Senate Administration confirms that in the Berlin vaccination centers around 87,000 second vaccinations were planned between June 8 and 15. Of these, about 19 percent were canceled or postponed. The numbers for the first vaccinations are similarly high. This means that about every fifth agreed vaccination appointment is canceled, postponed or simply not kept.</p>
<p>Mecklenburg-Vorpommern:</p>
<p>&rt;In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, 15 to 40 percent of the scheduled vaccinations fail, depending on the day, in the vaccination centers, said Health Minister Harry Glawe (CDU) on Tuesday. And that although there is enough vaccine available.</p>
<p>Sachsen-Anhalt:</p>
<p>&rt;The city of Magdeburg spontaneously invited its citizens to the vaccination center on Wednesday without an appointment because there were so many appointments left. "That has never happened before," said a spokeswoman for the city administration.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Are people afraid of a second dose? The article also states the following:</p>
<p>&rt;In the past week, 17 percent fewer second doses of the BioNTech vaccine were administered nationwide than planned. This number can be derived as follows: The interval between the first and second dose for mRNA vaccines should currently be exactly six weeks. Looking at the number of first vaccinations given six weeks ago, it is possible to estimate how many second vaccinations should have been given. This results from the vaccination rate monitoring of the RKI, which ZEIT ONLINE has evaluated.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In the case of the Astrazeneca vaccine, 28.5 percent of the planned second vaccinations were missing in the past week.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In case anyone wonders, Germany now has an Incidence of 6.2. You still must wear a mask everywhere, no matter if you get vaccinated or not. You still are not allowed to gather at some places at night, like the center of Stuttgart. No matter if you are vaccinated or not. You still have to do tests if you want to attend a footballmatch at the Euro2021, no matter if you are vaccinated or not. I can go on and on and on with the list. Of course there still a ban on all concerts, festivals and so on. My guess is, more and more people realize that they will not get their freedom back, no matter if they get the vaccine or not. Or they had such bad side effects from their first dose, that they are too scared now to take the second shot. And the third, and the fourth... </p>

        <p>We got quite a few promising news lately.</p>
<p>A University did tests on PCR-test and found that out of the 190,000 positive they checked &rt;80% actually werent infectious.</p>
<p>The Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Audit Office) came forward and said that due the way covid-grants were given out, hospitals massively underreported their ICUs and therefor suggesting a way higher % of hospital occupancy than actually happend.</p>
<p>Politicans had to resign due to profiting from illegal "mask-deals"...</p>
<p>Guess what happend?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>People are virtually incapable of processing this information. Like, when I heard the University study in the News... They realise, oh so that means PCR tests are useless and we cant base restrictions on the incidenz. However, this just creats another panic mode... If we cant use those numbers, which numbers do we use instead to justify restrictions?</p>
<p>Im losing my patients...</p>

<p>I read an article from the BMJ, that basically said the PCR test is useless at determining infection/infectiousness.  It could find coronavirus in you but it couldn't tell if it was alive or dead, and there would have to be other tests performed like a viral culture to determine that.  </p>
<p>In other words, you could have a whole shitload of people with inactive virus who pose no threat to others.</p>

        <p>I heard these news in radio today at my work place and i actually stoped walking for a second, and gave an empty stare to my coworker, because it caught me off-guard. Like they gave it a full list of possible reason why so many people missed their appointment, from warm weather, to forgetfullness, and I was able to think only about how ridiculous this is. Like do they report on how many people missed their dentist appointment? </p>
<p>It shouldnt have surprise me, but I dont normally listen to the radio, and was just taken aback for a moment.</p>

<p>What do you mean by this, exactly? You don't have to wear one outdoors, only indoors in most public places. And central Stuttgart had those riots last Summer, maybe the rules are related to that.</p>
