<title>Just keep an open mind: What if the vaccine/virus is some kind of nano tech. Those controlling the strings could've started by infecting the world leaders and then blackmail then into all of this. Considering that every government in the world is acting the exact same way. Blackmail?</title>

        <p>It is Nano tech. There's a Race for AI dominance between the major countries. Pandemic virus is  just an excuse to have the vaccine injected on you to implement this experiment. It will change your DNA from the inside with this tech. Thus we will be half human half machine.</p>

        <p>Interesting idea, but nano technology isn't advanced enough yet to do what you are thinking, and we are many years away from something like that. Even the secret operatives within the military are only about 10 - 20 years ahead of the tech that is available to the public. So no doubt we are not anywhere near that level of being remotely controlled or changed like that. </p>
<p>As for the world governments acting the same way, its a good observation and very suspicious for sure. But every government and politicians around the world all want the same thing... money, power, and control. It would be easy to get all of them to work together and do the same things if those things were promised to them or being threatened to be taken away. We dont need fancy tech to control human behavior, we just need the techniques found in social engineering.</p>
