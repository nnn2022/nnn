        <p>Yeah, but marketing Vaccines as if they’re both 100% safe and 100% necessary is ridiculous as well.</p>
<p>Btw I was on Accutane for 6 months with a rather high dose and I’m pretty sure it’s what’s caused a lot of my health issues I’ve been having as of late</p>

        <p>Sure. But some things are safer than others. </p>
<p>Drinking water (not inhaling!) has never killed anyone to my knowledge, but in theory if you drank too much you’d die of kidney failure. </p>
<p>Everything you put in your body has an LD50. The question is: what’s the threshold of “reasonably safe”?</p>

        <p>This is a very extreme case but at least one person has died of drinking to much water. I saw it on discovery health channel a long time ago. It was a show about bizarre deaths. Anyways a woman was on a radio show contest and they competed to see who could drink the most water and she won but then died shortly after getting back home. It was water toxicity, essentially every cell in her body drowned and ruptured. The electrolyte balance between the contents of the cells and the blood couldnt be maintained. To much water went into the cells and everything else was pushed out of the cells. After the show finished telling the women's story they explained that if they drank water with electrolytes instead of strait tap water she would have lived.</p>

        <p>If I remember right the contest took place over several hours. So that's plenty of time for the water to reach the bloodstream.</p>

        <p>No, I mean I’m surprised her kidneys didn’t force all that water <em>out</em> of her bloodstream. That’s literally (one of) their job(s), to maintain proper water balance.</p>

        <p>The kidneys simply couldnt keep up. And they weren't allowed to pee during the contest so after a certain point it backed up and the kidneys couldnt filter any more. Sorry I forgot to include that part.</p>

        <p>Good point! Everything has a risk associated with it. The question for all drugs should be "do the benefits outweigh the risks?"</p>
<p>In the case of mRNA vaccines for covid given to the general population, the answer is "not bloody likely", but no one really knows yet. Same thing for mask mandates. The likelihood of self-interested profit-driven pharma companies being honest about the risks are slim to none given their track records.</p>

        <p>Great, now line up so the government can force you to take all of them whether you need them or not, and you can't travel or return to civilised society until you do.</p>
<p>Seem reasonable?</p>
<p>And there were a lot of suicides and depression linked to accutane. Also a lot of deaths linked to Ssris, opioids, and a host of others. We really shouldn't let people have access unless they really need them and choose to accept the risks. Oh wait, we do that already. It's like we already knew forcing people to take untested and potentially dangerous chemicals was a bad idea, but forgot that like all other science in 2020.</p>

        <p>Who needs the scientific method of inquiry when we now have the Cult of Dogmatic Scientism?  It's far easier to listen up and do exactly as they say instead of dealing with all the asking questions, doing the experiment, analyzing the results, forming a new hypothesis, and asking questions again.  It gets tiring.  Let me have some of that Kool Aid.</p>
