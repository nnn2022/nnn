        <p>I don't agree with 99.9% of the stuff on this sub but like coming here to see what the "alternate" science folks are coming up with. Agree that anyone should be able to comment and debate, whatever their stance. Just because we don't agree doesn't mean we're trolling.</p>

        <p>None of it makes sense. That is why we are upset. State governors, members of Congress, members of Parliament, provincial leaders have all been caught breaking their own mandates with no accountability. That is why we don't trust them. When a member of the UK government was caught having an affair after telling their nation not to even hug their relatives they should be tossed out. It should not be used as a way to prevent people from looking into the actions of their officials. The amount of censorship is staggering.  Anyone from a decorated doctor to an average Joe to the president of the United States have been blocked from speaking freely online. We now have fact checkers who go over what we think and say. </p>
<p>I don't agree with a 99% survival rate disease creating this massive response.  Their unscientific fixes for a very real issue are laughable at best but are tyrannical in practice. There should not have been mask mandates or mandatory anything. We all had to take a test that the cdc then claimed did not work. They said we have to wear masks that do not filter items as small as a viral pathogen. If they had stopped at recommending washing your hands and staying away from others when sick it would make sense. They locked down the world, ruined economies, caused global ripples in supply chain, put soldiers on the streets of democratic nations to enforce curfew while still holding Olympic games. Small businesses are forced to close by mandate but mega chains can stay open. The transfer of wealth in insane.</p>

        <p>Masks absolutely do work where compliance is almost 100%. Almost every asian country has the proof of that in their massively lower local transmission rates and quicker containment. Most of their economies never shut, or it was a small percentage of those in the west. Half the people wearing them half the time is stupid though.</p>

        <p>I always thought, before all this, how Asian culture wore masks when they felt sick to not spread it to others or when they traveled (was the reasoning, as I understood it).  Just seemed like good manners.  It was bizarre to western culture before covid, like in The Big Short when Brad Pitt's character gave the nod to the other guy wearing one in the airport, or the guy in k-pax was literally in the mental institution suffering hypochondriasis and wearing a mask and scrubs.  Seemed crazy on this side of the pond.  But that said, with covid, I feel many aren't doing these things as the former example but more the latter.</p>

        <p>The politicisation of masks is a scandal. Toilet seat scientists telling us how they don't work with while countries proving they do. There were anti maskers in the Spanish flu epidemic as well, and there will be for the next one. Shameful.</p>

        <p>I don't agree with subs that ban me for participating in subs they disagree with, or mods who read my posts and ban me from their subreddits. I have been getting banned from forums and akilled off IRC since the 1990s, nothing new, to me. </p>
<p>All the subs that ban you for participating here allow you to appeal the decision, it isn't permanent without a grievance process or something, but personally I thought: why bother? I have almost 12 years account and plenty of karma. I am a member of hundreds of subreddits. Maybe over a thousand? Probably not, but either way, I don't care. I was banned from TD. I been banned from /r/politics for years... because I told a bot to "DIAF" (just the acronym). </p>
<p>The stupidest subreddits now are the dumb conservative ones that make you "prove" you are a conservative. Absolutely retarded (sorry, I am not PC, you can cancel me like everybody else does). Take this secret oath of allegiance to Donald Trump or else we don't want your opinion in our echo chamber!! Fucking morons. Dumb shits. Idiots. Zero input from outside sources, just like their genetics! Keep it all in the family, you backwoods hillbillies! </p>
<p>I used to love debating people on various subreddits. Isn't that what the internet is for?</p>
<p>Democrats ban you from their subreddit before you can even post there and Republicans want you to upload a picture of you with Trump's cock in your mouth so you can be allowed to post. Bunch of pussy shit from both parties, vagina diarrhea. Nobody feels safe unless they talk only with people that agree with them. </p>
<p>One of my last posts on a normal subreddit, I said that if one person drowned in a pool, Democrats would ban swimming pools and Republicans would ban swimming lessons and say pools don't really exist. Downvoted to shit. Why? Because Republicans and Democrats both got their little panties on a knot when somebody called out their collective bullshit.</p>
<p>Keep voting for whatever clown party you been voting for: voting for the other party doesn't change shit. When they trade power again you can all cry about how every minor inconvenience in your life is caused by the party currently in power that you disagree with.</p>
<p>Republicans whine and piss ohh 0bama (sorry, Biden now), made gas expensive and gave Mexicans covid and 5G and black people are getting too uppity and the gays are just everywhere now, whaaaaaa, bunch of big fucking cry baby jackals afraid of their own shadow.</p>
<p>Democrats did the same shit when Trump was in office. Anybody remember when COVID first came out and Trump banned China travel, almost immediately? Democrats don't remember because it shows he took it way serious and they all said he was being racist. Republicans don't remember because they spent all the time since then pretending Covid was a hoax.</p>
<p>News flash: none of you have working memories or common sense. You are driven entirely by fear and controversy - look at this subreddit, seriously. This is worse than /r/collapse - most conservative subreddits are. </p>
<p>I heard some dumb twat yesterday say Biden was going to "tear up the constitution" - like somehow the mere symbolic act of ripping a piece of paper would strip them of their "rights" they pretend to have. You don't have any rights. The government pretends you do to placate your dumb assess. None of those "rights" bestowed to you by some dusty piece of paper are going to stop the fascist police state from arresting your dumb ass and dragging you through court and destroying your life. That is a FACT.</p>
