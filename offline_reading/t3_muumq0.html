    <strong>Just had a thought: Why I'm skeptical</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not going to delve into what vaxxers and maskers call "conspiracy theory," I'm just using logic here. Here is one main reason why I'm skeptical about everything relating to COVID, and it's just basic logic and common sense (I know, rare). So they are telling us that we discover this virus sometime around December 2019, and within a few short months it becomes a "global pandemic." They freak out and start researching as much as possible, divesting millions (if not billions) into research, and are able to miraculously come up with a vaccine in less than a year. Less than a year, that's the fastest development of a vaccine in history. Do you know the next fastest development? Mumps, in the 1960s, and that took 4 years to develop. So they mean to tell us we have a successful vaccine for COVID in less than 12 months, yet over 40 years later, and countless TRILLIONS spent on research and we still don't have a cure for cancer. Cancer, which still has a fatality rate close to 50% overall compared to covid which has a roughly overall fatality rate of 1-2%. That doesn't add up. There are entire hospitals, universities, and multi-billion dollar laboratories set up strictly dedicated to cancer research, but in less than one calendar year we've managed to develop, test, and release a vaccine for a "novel" virus? Am I missing something here? Sorry if I just don't get it, but this doesn't make logical sense.</p></p>

        <p>Firstly you need to understand that cancer is </p>
<p>“a disease caused by an uncontrolled division of abnormal cells in a part of the body.“</p>
<p>Or “a malignant growth or tumor resulting from the division of abnormal cells.“</p>
<p>There are MANY different types of cancer, and I am not talking about like breast or brain cancer, those are locations, not types. </p>
<p>I’m talking about Carcinoma, Leukemia, Sarcoma and others like it. Each one is it’a own different thing and will probably have to be fought differently. A cure all drug would be unrealistic. </p>
<p>That being said many drugs have been found to work against certain types of cancer. For some reason they never get talked about though. For example Taxol.</p>

        <p>I would strongly suggest to share this reasoning with a professor in a relevant field. Or someone who works in a cancee research lab for example. He or she could elaborate on why cancer is not something you can just cure. The problem is, once it spreads you have to destroy most of your body to destroy all of the cancer cells. It's comparing apples to oranges frankly. The progress that the covid reseachers made is remarkable indeed and I respect them for their contributions</p>

        <p>Cancer can't be vaccinated against. COVID can because it is a virus, while cancer is a malignant growth that takes nutrients from the body.</p>
