    <strong>Just show some proof? Any at all?</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously. I get it. It happens with a lot of catastrophes. We want more than anything to find some sort of order in events which cause us distress. We want there to be someone behind the scenes pulling the strings because although that too is frightening, it’s better than chaos. </p>
<p>As someone with bipolar disorder, I inevitably became paranoid and began believing conspiracy theories when I became manic or had psychotic depression. I understand the thinking. I never lost my ability to think critically about the world, however. Critical rational thought would tell us that if this were a hoax, literally millions of every day healthcare workers around the globe would have to be in on the deception. How do you suggest this is possible? Have none of you ever worked in even a small group of people? Keeping a secret among tens of millions of people is impossible. </p>
<p>And why? That’s also very important. What does some shadowy secret society gain from tanking the world economy? In a capitalistic society you want growth, not untimely death. Every person who dies from this virus is one less person able to spend money and keep the cogs turning. I’m a rational, free thinker just as many of you claim to be. What pieces of hard evidence am I missing? Where’s the smoking gun? Because all I see are nations attempting their best at keeping their populations from dying off in large numbers.</p></p>
