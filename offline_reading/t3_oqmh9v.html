    <strong>Vaccine Opinions</strong>
    <p><p>I have been curious about the vaccine as I have recently been offered by my job. I turned it down in early march but now I‚Äôm taking the time to weigh my risks/benefits of getting it and trying to come up with reasons why I should or should not get it. I have asked many people but they all were pro vaccine and I‚Äôm looking for possible reasons to not get it so I‚Äôm asking here. I‚Äôm taking this very seriously and I am hoping for genuine reasons that support not getting it. I am a 20 year old male if that distinguishes anything. Please be respectful as I am asking sincerely and thank you to those that do!</p></p>

        <p>20 year old male‚Ä¶ that does indeed distinguish everything.</p>
<p>Just look up the stats on mortality rate with covid in that age bracket, particularly mortality rate without underlying health conditions. </p>
<p>After looking at those stats I‚Äôd struggle to believe how anyone would suggest the vaccine is the right thing for you.</p>

        <p>I know this is just a personal story and not evidence but:</p>
<p>I am also a 20 year old man with no problems at all, I asked the nurse at the covid testing place if the vaccine affects fertility she said she doesn‚Äôt know of all the side effects and went to get a doctor, the doctor then said he is unsure whether it does affect fertility, at the same time he can‚Äôt deny that it does. </p>
<p>So as a twenty year old man who wants children soon I can‚Äôt take the risk personally and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not getting it. Also I have like almost 0% chance of even noticing I have symptoms let alone dying</p>

        <p>20 year old male? Why even bother? And people are getting covid again after being vaccinated anyway. And there are concerns of really bad reactions with the vaccine. There is no logical reason to get it at all. Its all social engineering to create peer pressure.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs your own choice. Ultimately you should be deciding on medical intervention because it‚Äôs something <em>you</em> feel <em>you</em> need, for <em>your own</em> protection.<br>
My own opinion on your question is:
As a 20yr old your risks of having a serious issue with Covid are minute, to the point that falling down the stairs is as likely.<br>
If you take medication for any reason (wanting to travel etc)other than a concern for your own health, you are not making a rational decision.</p>

        <p>For your demographic, assuming you have no co-morbidities and are not obese, your chances of death from Covid are extremely low - probably lower than the regular flu. The chances of severe side effects from any of the vaccines are also extremely low, but there is an elevated risk in your demographic of myocarditis from the mRNA vaccines specifically. So if you do choose to get vaccinated, the J&amp;J or Astrozenica vaccines seem to be the best for you. If you were female, those have increased blood clot risk and the mRNA vaccines seem to be safer.  </p>
<p>Regardless, you're at super low risk from Covid, and the largest chance from getting the vaccine is no side effects, with about a 40% chance of having a mild side effect of feeling sick for a few days (especially from the second dose if you were to go with a 2-shot vaccine).</p>

        <p>The vaccine just creates an immune response to the spike protein in Covid. All the side effects are from this major immune response.</p>
<p>Form how I understand it, you can get these rare side effects from catching Covid as well as the vaccine because it's just your own bodies immune system </p>
<p>I've done research into a lot of the big claims made on here for eg. Spike proteins get produced forever, but that's not true your body breaks them down quickly.</p>
<p>Myocarditis for eg. Is from an immune response, not something in the jab.</p>
<p>The real issue most people have with the vaccine is its not needed, Covid isn't that deadly at all and people your age should probably just take your chances with that. </p>
<p>Given the mishandling of this around the world, there is a lot of pressure to vaccinate even though it's pointless. But it does seem safe, right now anyway. People speculate that it could have unknown long term effects but we really don't know anything about this yet. </p>
<p>In my opinion it won't have many long term effects since your body breaks down the spike proteins within a few days and the mRNA( the bit that makes your cells produce spike proteins) get broken down almost instantly on contact.</p>
