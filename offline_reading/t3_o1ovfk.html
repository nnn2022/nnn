    <strong>A list of points when dealing with MSM propaganda from the normie crowd.</strong>
    <p><p>Here's something I wrote to address some normies, feel free to use. </p>
<p>"Here are some things to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legally, J&amp;J, AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna have all had their liabilities waived in the event of damages and each stand to make billions of dollars on these therapies with absolutely no legal liability in the event of side-effects or harm to patients.</li>
<li>No long-term human testing has taken place.</li>
<li>For some of these vaccines (Moderna and AZ, I believe) they are still seeking FDA approval, and any side-effects will not be covered by health insurance for using a non-FDA-approved substance.</li>
<li>The mRNA gene therapy techniques used to create the spike protein necessary to fight the coronavirus is still highly experimental.</li>
<li>The inventor of mRNA rewrite technology, Dr. Robert W Malone MD, has expressed deep concerns regarding the use of this technology as a vaccine against COVID. He has been largely censored on social media.</li>
<li>To address the "total COVID deaths" number, the CDC quietly released the following stat after growing reports of gunshot and car accident victims being labeled as "COVID" deaths upon a positive PCR test.</li>
<li>"For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death."</li>
<li>Source: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm</a></li>
<li>Reviewing Table 1 of that same site shows that when broken down by age (and keeping in mind that the average COVID death has 4 other comorbidities) 96% of COVID deaths are in patients aged 50+.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, with <em>all</em> of that in mind, and realizing under point #1 these four companies stand to make billions and with the further understanding that all companies will prefer a Service business model over a Product business model to streamline and stabilize their incomes rather than rely on a fickle market, does it not seem <em>probable</em> that these companies, having somehow won the trust of the public, would state that vaccine efficacy is dependent entirely upon repeat injections to establish a continued product line.</p>
<p>Remember, the way a conman steals your money is by first convincing you of a problem, and then explaining that he has the only solution.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I write all of this just to encourage anyone with the patience to read all of it that there is a lot of money on the table and to please be exceedingly conscientious about trusting authority in a field that has repeatedly shown itself to not only be corrupt, but sociopathic in its mishandling of patient care in favor of the US Dollar."</p></p>

        <p>They've heard all of these things and they don't read or watch videos. They aren't even open to the <em>possibility</em> that this is anything other than a horrible deadly virus that will kill anyone it touches.</p>
<p>They are impervious to any facts, logic, or reason. You are fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>A more logical approach is to prepare yourself to defend yourself. Because that's what's next.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this. I find it hard to not just tell people to piss off and mind their own business when they have an issue with me not wanting to take one of these. </p>
<p>Dr Robert Maloneâ€™s Twitter is an interesting read!</p>
