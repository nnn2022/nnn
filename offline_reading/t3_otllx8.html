    <strong>You have to take control of the narrative!</strong>
    <p><p>As the title states. You have to take "control" of the narrative. I keep seeing people repeating the vaxxer vs antivaxxer narrative. STOP IT ALREADY! Stop referring to yourselves as antivaxxers if you haven't gotten the jab and to those who did as vaxxers.</p>
<p>You are just feeding into their agenda and narrative and labeling yourselves as something less, something that has it's humanity removed.</p>
<p>Instead take control. Why are you letting them label you as less than human? This is the start of them trying to dehumanize you. Instead realize and begin to speak up that you are healthy humans and it is they the vaccinated that are in fact NOT ALL RIGHT!</p>
<p>You aren't antivaxxers you are <strong>HUMAN</strong> and they are essentially <strong>MUTANTS</strong>. They have chosen to inject themselves with non approved, experimental (genetic) RNA therapy and are therefore no longer HUMAN as their body is now mutating at an accelerated rate to prep it for a lifelong dependence on Big Pharma.</p>
<p>You, on the other hand are still a genuine un-altered human.</p>
<p>You aren't anti vaxxers. You are HUMAN. You are precious, unique, as god and the universe has decreed you to be. Say it with pride.</p>
<p><strong>This is about Human vs Nonhuman not vaxxer vs antivaxxer.</strong> As they get more yearly injections and boosters they will become less and less human over time. Who knows what they will become? Maybe mindless synthetic robots, zombie mutants, regressed sub humans? Who knows, who cares....the end result is the same....at some point in the near future, they will no longer be human.</p>
<p>Humans need to band together and start to protect other humans from the Mutants! Yes there may be more of them but over time many of them will die off or become less powerful then you because they will no longer be human and no longer have the divinity that resides within you.</p>
<p>What is their goal? It's to get to a point where everyone gets jabbed at birth to destroy the humanity within and create a lifelong dependence on synthetic genetic altering therapy that can be used for total population management.</p>
<p><strong>Say No to the Mutant!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Call them out on it!</strong></p>
<p>Point out that they are the Mutant. They are the outsiders. You by your own divine right are fully Human!</p>

<p>Yes I do understand that I am labeling them as well, as something less then human because they are now,.</p>
<p>We have reached a crossroads, a new normal as this sub implies and if there is no other way then we have to fight fire with fire. It is time to label them now for what they are....Mutants. </p>
<p>and for all of you in Europe....you should already be familiar with this concept:</p>
<p>Say NO to the Xeno, <strong>The Mutant,</strong> the Heretic. The Emperor Protects!</p></p>
