    <strong>They've Weaponized Vagueness</strong>
    <p><p>Ah popular platitude that our side has used is, "Imagine a virus so deadly that you have to take a test to know whether or not you have it."</p>
<p>As funny as that is, it goes even further because they also say, "Even the tests aren't absolute. Even if you test negative, you might still have it." I have to take a test at work (UGH) and when you go to the results page, it says, "Note: It's possible this screen will produce a false result and should therefore not serve as a replacement for medical advice." This in and of itself is ridiculous. What other advice would a medical professional give? If testing is the primary way of finding covid cases, would a test not count as medical advice? </p>
<p>They have made everything surrounding the coronavirus so vague. You don't know if you have it, even if you do have it you might be asymptomatic, it could take up to 10 days to show symptoms, and even if you test negative, you might still have it. You simply <em>don't know!</em> </p>
<p>This is intentional. They never got away with draconian tyranny with past pandemics because it was clear cut. If you have Ebola, you have Ebola. But with Covid, you "don't know so it's better to be safe than sorry!" </p>
<p>They have effectively taken vagueness, and weaponized it, and people have bought into this hook line and sinker. After all, even if you're perfectly healthy, YOU MIGHT HAVE THE VIRUS! So why not just stay home indefinitely and sacrifice your right to live as a human, because you just don't know!</p></p>

        <p>It gets even worse.  They go back and forth between:</p>
<p>"Novel virus!!  We shouldn't assume anything!!" </p>
<p>To:</p>
<p>"Oh, but this vaccine has undertaken robust testing.  We know this vaccine works."</p>
<p>They are constantly flipping back and forth between "we can't know" and "we know and you can't argue".  It's maddening.</p>

        <p>It's funny because we know that asymptomatic spread is not common (studies such as that one with nearly ten million people made that pretty clear) but people say 'oh we just don't know'. Yet with masks, where the evidence is largely conflicted and the results of the RCT study were inconclusive, they say it's' settled science'.</p>

        <p>That's what annoys me, everyone is sick. Any other test is negative a doctor will tell you it's negative &amp; you don't have the illness. </p>
<p>Hey doomers do you use a condom everytime you have sex because you might have HIV. No? Then shut up about the mask.</p>

        <p>The worst is the intentional confusion using the terms "might" or "may" or "could".   Each of these indicates something that is possible but the probability is somewhere between 1%  and 99%.  Usually you know which end by context but media intentionally removes that.</p>
<p>A good scientist will always use what I refer to as "weasel words" in order to be accurate.  If something is not certain, it is "might".</p>
<p>"New strains may be immune to vaccine".  - Given the history of research in virology, it is a possibility, but it's not at all likely.</p>
<p>"Virus may be transmitted by contact with food".  - Likewise, we can't rule it out, but probably not.</p>
<p>"Further lockdowns may be required to curb the spread".  - We know it won't work, but you can damn well bet we are going to do it.</p>
<p>By conflating "mights" that have high and low probabilities the press makes every one sound like a pronouncement of truth from on high.</p>
