    <strong>Stop debating whether or not the vaccine is safe. That's beside the point.</strong>
    <p><p>Safe or not, we are entitled to choose what we put in our bodies. It's as simple as that. The real questions are:</p>
<p>a) Does the vaccine have any tangible health benefit? (we already know it doesn't)</p>
<p>b) Will the restrictions be lifted once everyone's vaccinated? (we also know the answer to this)</p>
<p>c) Will it be a one-off type of vaccine? (do I need to comment?)</p>
<p>d) Do they want to vaccinate people who are already immune? (yup)</p>
<p>e) Is it suspicious that the governments are so intent on vaccinating everyone considering the answers to the questions above? (hell yeah)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is not being anti-vaxxer or a conspiracy theorist: this is seeing the actual conspiracy that is unfolding. It's history repeating itself. It's a pretty dangerous situation for all of us.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: Hi everyone! Thanks for the upvotes and awards, it's good to see I'm not alone in our current dystopian circumstances (although it sure looks like I am, judging from the amount of friends and acquaintances I managed to alienate by voicing my opinion over the last year). A big thanks also for the doomers in the comment section, I always welcome debate. Too bad you had to use sarcasm, aggression and often a condescending tone that further evidenced how your arguments are fuelled by emotion and not by logical reasoning.</p></p>

        <p>I'm not, or I wasn't anti-vaccine.  I got all my shots.  Now I don't know what to believe.
This virus is in the same family as the common cold.  Are they saying we can cure that?  Why is that suddenly a problem?  Are there other diseases on the way?  Or is it all made up?  I'm not sure which would be worse.</p>
<p>Something is wrong.  I don't necessarily know what, but I feel manipulated, lied to, corralled.  I'm not sure what the end goal is here but it can't be good for most of us.</p>
<p>I'm not seeing convincing evidence the tests work well enough, some information or instructions out there make no sense, are contradictory or just plain have no scientific basis.</p>
<p>It literally feels like a gigantic propaganda machine.
I'm even questioning this whole debate about "Fake News" that's being decided alongside COVID.  It seems like the perfect tool to immediately put down any dissenting ideas.  "Nope, Fake News".  Get your news from Government Approved Official Sources only.</p>
<p>Tell me, what kinda society does that sound like?</p>

        <p>Haha my uncle went off the grid after he got back from Vietnam. Crazy billy we called him. Had a talking squirrel according to him. It was never the same squirrel twice. Eventually one of the little guys clawed him and he died of an infection out there but up until then he was living. Beautiful country.</p>

        <p>Crazy.  We actually already have a diff deep remote lake property with a 1 room cabin on it. Going to start using this summer, no one has used it in years.  The problem is it's a family owned thing so I can't really improve it.  The 20 acres is more for investment and if we decide to sell our place in town and build out in the boonies</p>

        <p>I already live in kind of rednecky area and have all my life. It’s not what it’s cracked up to be. </p>
<p>It’s a hassle to get by and then, You get cabin fever and there’s not many ways to relieve that without traveling, which can no longer be done in a normal and enjoyable way. </p>
<p>With mask wearing and so many things being closed, traveling is no better than staying home and watching a screensaver of scenic photographs.</p>

The wasteful model on manipulating markets by wasting resources and selling at a profit to people who can't refuse to buy will fall at the wayside, not so the human leeches who have raped the planet and it's people to achieve exorbitant fortune. They will place themselves in a new pantheon of benevolent rulers who dole out resources and justice from up on high. Each new Olympian will have status equal to the amount of wealth they have accumulated in the run up to the great resetvand dwell in towers that scrape the sky and shine bright as the sun. There in those guided halls thet will gather to decide the fates of mortal men.</p>

        <p>The demons of America are fraud and avarice. </p>
<p>That's the whole point of Luciferianism.  To become gods.  It's the same promises the serpent made to Eve in the garden.  </p>

        <p>Specifically, they want to become gods through knowledge and self-will. They want to replace God and be in every way like Him, which is impossible. <a href="https://theorthodoxlife.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/what-is-theosis/">God actually wants us to become gods, His sons and daughters.</a> It's why we were created.

        <p>That's not really becoming gods.  I see where you're going with this, but to say we'd become gods is too presumptuous. We're still human in heaven and when we're eventually reunited with our bodies. And that's if we're that fortunate to persevere to the end.</p>

        <p>I'm also not anti-vax. i got all my shots as a kid. If needed for a specific holiday destination i also get the required shots for that. </p>
<p>But I don't necessarily trust in them blindly. I was vaccinated for Whooping-cough and still caught that. And it wasnt fun.</p>
<p>When I was around 12 or something the HPV (uterine cancer) vaccination came to my country and everyone kept pushing and pushing young girls to get it "just to be sure" and "better safe then sorry" but that vaccine was also pretty new and side effects were vague and little was known on long term effects.  My parents made the choice (since i was a kid) to delay me getting that vaccine until they saw the outcome, and I'm pleased that they did.  </p>
<p>I'm not saying I'll never get this "covid shot" But I am gonna wait to get it until i feel good and comfy with it.</p>

<p>While perhaps mildly toddler-esque in this scenario, when dealing with what substances we put in our body, I think "I dont wanna" should be plenty or reason.</p>

        <p>Coronaviruses are not in the same family as the common cold. I don't know who told you this, but it's incorrect. There's a plethora of differences (and similarities!) between coronaviruses and the common cold.</p>
<p>Taxonomy wise, they are both part of: Virus&rt;Realm: Riboviria&rt;Kingdom: Orthornavirae&rt;Phylum: Pisuviricota&rt;Class: Pisoniviricetes</p>
<p>You might be thinking, right... this is a trend... they've followed the same categories so far... But that's where they diverge. Then Coronavirus is in the Order: Nidovirales, and common cold is in the Order: Picornavirales.</p>
<p>There is a family of viruses (consisting of one genus, one species) within that Class, under the Order: Sobelivirales (<em>you see how Order is at the point in which common cold and coronaviruses diverged too?</em>), that only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaviridae">attacks mushrooms</a>.</p>
<p>To put that into more perspective for you, y'know what else is in the same Class? Whales and humans. Dogs and rats. I wouldn't give any random human medicine to a whale. Probably won't be effective, or it might even be detrimental. Same goes with these viruses you're referring to. You can't make some comparison like you're trying to and say, "well this one has a vaccine and the other <em>somehow</em> can't have one?!?!" - there's a lot more to it than that.</p>

        <p>I think they are saying that healthcare systems can’t handle another endemic virus.  the flu already overwhelms global healthcare systems and now public health officials have covid on top of the flu to deal with year after year.  Do I think it’s being made into a bigger deal than it is, yes.  Do I think most health systems in the world can handle it, yes. Would covid have stayed a constant threat without a vaccine, probably.  But scientists and public health officials like to think everything is a crisis. The vaccine is just money making opportunity.</p>

        <p>Think about how bizarre and idealistic it is to have a pandemic that can only be solved by giving a shot to literally everyone in the country.  </p>
<p>I don't like going full schizo with conspiracy theories, but someone said awhile back that isn't it strange how we had all those memes about anti-vaxxers back in 2019? At the time I thought it was reaching, but now I don't know. Seems like the effect of that was not just to make anti-vaxxers look stupid, but more importantly to make vaccinating the "right &amp; good thing to do". Without that priming of the public, would there be as many people so eager to get the vaccine? If vaccines were more mundane a subject, I think we'd see a lot more skepticism.</p>

        <p>As soon as WW II got off and running, Hollywood (at the behest of DC) began cranking out propaganda shorts and then movies, encouraging women to get factory jobs and men to enlist. "We're all in this together" was the catchphrase.</p>
<p>As soon as WW II ended, Hollywood (at the behest of DC) began cranking out dimestore Freudian bullshit movies, about how women who wanted to work outside the home instead of as housewivesanmothers, or who weren't eager to marry and crank out a litter were mentally ill and would probably end up in an insane asylum/a suicide/dead at the hands of the husband they "emasculated".  DC took this action because a large majority of the women who worked in the munitions factories stated that they wanted to continue being gainfully employed, even with the war over. DC wanted all the jobs to go to returning GIs, and for women to go back into their homes and stay there.</p>
<p>Is that the ONLY time Hollywood has propagandized US citizens? Is DC the ONLY government to do this to its citizenry ? Are movies the only source of propaganda directed at "nudging" people into believing or behaving in a way convenient for our sociopathic overlords?</p>

        <p>Oh I totally believe it. I just don't have evidence to back up the antivaxxer memes. It's definitely something they could (and would) seed into people's heads. There's probably <em>some</em> CIA document out there detailing the phenomenon of memes and how this can be "used politically" (i.e. propaganda)</p>

        <p>I think asking if it’s safe or not is a HUGE deal. Why the hell would we be forced to put something so new, and completely untested for long term effects, into our bodies. Of course it’s not safe. Even if in the end it doesn’t cause any harm, just that fact that we don’t know it from any kind of trial process (WE ARE THE TRIALS) is something that should make people think “hey do they really care about our well-being?”</p>

        <p>We got some long email from a "nurse" yesterday that I deleted without reading. It was some kind of Q &amp; A. I got to the part where it queried whether the vaccine was rushed and just said NAH. I keep thinking about how they'll have to replace me before firing me and how I'm the only one qualified to train anyone on my job. I'd refuse to train them.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I think I got some new power yesterday. One of my coworkers left a lengthy note on a patient profile. It stated that the covid vaccine is new and not proven to be safe and effective. Therefore he recommends the patient use caution if he gets it and also still use covid safety protocols (masks/social distancing).</p>

        <p>If you accept that the government is not doing anything nefarious I think then it is reasonable to start considering the pros and cons of the vaccine itself. The problem is at this point we <em>know</em> that this vaccine is going to be used to exert an extreme amount of power over the people so who gives a fuck if it's safe or not? Just don't take it!</p>

        <p>If vaccinating people and moving away from COVID and lockdowns was actually the goal, dictators (aka governments) around the world would be talking about reopening relative to the number of people vaccinated. Given that mask and lockdown fetishes have gained far more traction, something makes me think that they are cooking up some other plan. It just doesn't seem right.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't be surprised if those that choose not to get vaccinated are dehumanized and portrayed as anything short of terrorists in the months to come. Your access to goods and services will be restricted and will be "justifiably" so. This will be done in plain sight for everyone to see and with everyone's support. It's a crucial step in the race government has been running for a long time to extend their power over us.</p>

        <p>I actually think the science behind the vaccine is really cool, I dont understand it that well so I'm not gonna get too into it here but there's plenty of resources out there describing it if you're interested. </p>
<p>But I refuse to take it for pretty much the exact reasons you've outlined above. If the world governments (perhaps the pluralization of "government" is unnecessary there) weren't so keen on forcing everyone to take it I would have no problem taking it but taking it is tacitly supporting the government securing the ability to force you to inject whatever they want so long as they can manufacture a crisis.</p>

        <p>The first thing to do is to stop calling the mRNA stuff a vaccine.   <br>
Because they're not, and, including the mRNA stuff in the vaccine group is to do irreparable harm to the reputation of vaccine's overall. </p>
<p>mRNA treatments are brand new, untested and of dubious merit in regards to the publicly stated use case.  <br>
The mRNA treatments <em>are not</em> vaccines, any and all arguments used to support vaccination cannot be applied. </p>
<p>Even if it was shown to be 100% effective and have 0% side effects, the only thing that matters is <em>informed consent</em>.  <br>

        <p>mRNA vaccines are vaccines. A vaccine is anything that primes the immune system and provides acquired immunity to an infectious disease. That's literally what mRNA vaccines do.</p>
<p>They do it in a different way than other forms of vaccines, in the same way that an electric car propels itself in a different way than a conventional car. That doesn't make an electric car not a car.</p>

        <p>No they are not.</p>
<p>I'm sure you can craft up any number of rationalizations for why you could call them that - none of them will change the facts. </p>
<p>Additionally, if these mRNA vaccines provided any immunity to a particular disease, why are people being told to continue wearing masks and self isolating if they test positive <em>after</em> being vaccinated?</p>
<p>What is the mRNA treatment actually doing if it doesn't meet even this most basic of requirements for a vaccine?</p>

        <p>I agree...I don’t really care about the vaccine being safe bc I genuinely think it is safe. I do care about forcing people to get it especially kids...I also just feel the messaging around the vaccine is so off.  It should be like the shingles vaccine.  If you are over 50, we encourage you to get it.  If you are under 50, it’s not necessary but if you feel you need it, get it.</p>

        <p>The messaging has been terrible. Governments have asserted their authority to shut down lives and livelihoods at whim and at the behest of unelected public health officials. And now that there is indeed a verifiable silver bullet, even that's not enough to banish the shutdown psychopaths back to whatever bunkers they crawled out of. This infuriates a lot of people, and it's not a clear left vs right dichotomy this time. </p>
<p>And unfortunately taking the vaccine is becoming a de facto capitulation to the endless bullshit so far and whatever bullshit is yet to come in a forthcoming "crisis." I don't mistrust the vaccine per se, but I don't want anything to do with the authorities that are pushing it. I'm not sure how to resolve that.</p>

        <p>In the negative sense, yes.<br>
In the positive sense, no.</p>
<p>For instance you definitely have the negative right to reject having drugs, dicks, syringes, or anything else being put in your body against your will.</p>
<p>But you definitely don't have any positive right to have something put in your body, like your neighbor's tasty looking handbag dog.</p>

        <p>In fairness I know 2 people who have had it . I was with one of them when they got the text (in close proximity for a long period of time) - I didn't get it. Could have been a false positive - he did have a cough though. He's sound as a pound now. My other mate got the text saying he has it as of sunday, he has a mild tickly cough though feels golden otherwise. </p>
<p>I had it according to my test conducted a month or so ago, though I barely coughed over the course of a couple of days, I may have had it though I'm not convinced.</p>
<p>I really don't think the vast majority of the population should even entertain the idea of vaccination for this. A handful of people who are likely to be affected? Sure, if they feel it's safe and right. But when I'm seeing people brush it off with next to no symptoms (the 2 people I know are 30 and 39 and significantly overweight with a fair drinking habbit, far from a picture of great health generally) It appears to be fear mongering. </p>
<p>The 'anti-anti-vaxxer' memes (propaganda) we sat through for the last 2 - 3 years seems really fucking dubious and well timed to me right now; considering this 'vaccine' is simultaneously being marketed as a miracle that every person on earth should receive- yet in the same breath it's explained to be no magic bullet and won't buy us back our freedom... so tell me how I'm anti vax again for not wanting to flush poorly tested bullshit through my body to stop me from getting AS SICK from a virus that gives you a mild cough; yet I STILL have to sit in my house and not mingle with anyone. If people can't smell the bullshit from a mile off, then i guess the media brainwashing really does work.

        <p>An effective vaccine IS a silver bullet. That's the point. No one gives a shit about chicken pox (for example) because an effective vaccine is available. There is no need to structure society around avoiding chicken pox. So yeah, the fact that the vaccines here are NOT being touted as a way out is..... peculiar</p>

        <p>I've never been an anti-vaxxer, and by all means I won't be. This covid shit is bullshit though. Especially since they prioritize criminals over the elderly, when they don't do that for flu shots. This seems to be a rapidly mutating virus, so why are they insisting we vaccinate everyone? like flu shots, people at risk should get them and people not at risk should just keep on keepin' on.</p>

        <p>I'm not against vaccines in general but I am against taking away people's decisions to make a risk assessment for themselves. For many of us, risk of covid is very very low and there is no need to take the vaccine. But due to the short testing time in comparison to the usual 10+ years, the health risks the vaccine could pose are very much unknown at this point, and for that reason I have deduced that I am going to take the extremely low risk instead of the unknown risk. I hope that the vaccines can help the people who are at legitimate risk from covid, but forcing them upon everyone (including those at risk, they should get to make the decision too) is a breach  of our right to choose what medical procedures we take, and that is both wrong and unnecessary.</p>

        <p>Lol. Yeah.... by the time covid is done, if it doesn't reoccur annually, we'll have lost over one million Americans. Is that not a dangerous situation? Is it really the proposed vaccine that could prevent some of those deaths thats the true danger?</p>
<p>Some of you are lost and need some guidance, the rest of you are the runoff of r/conspiracy who for whatever reason think every single God damn thing that you don't like was conspired to put you down in one way or another. And for those people, seek some fucking professional help.</p>

        <p>Well, is 1 million Americans more than the amount of people the common flu (or any other preventable death cause) kills every year? The vaccine does not prevent death in a significant way, therefore it's useless. Even if it did, it wouldn't be justified in an infection with such a low death rate. We're not lost, we're just capable of critical thinking, unlike your gullible lot.</p>

        <p>CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.</p>

        <p>Oh but it is bullshit. First of all, the PCR test isn't adequate as a means of screening, as many health experts have stated. That alone invalidates all infection and mortality rates. Secondly, people who tested positive and died are automatically labelled as a COVID death in the majority of cases, even when there's no causality involved. Do I believe your grandmother died of COVID? Sure, I'm guessing she was not exactly young. Would she have died with the common flu if COVID wasn't a thing? Probably. Does her death prove anything regarding mortality rates? Obviously not.</p>

        <p>a) It makes you immune to a disease, it doesn't require mental gymnastics to figure, we coined both this term and the 1st vaccine in the 1700's.</p>
<p>b) Rather, when there is no important number of active and/or new cases, which will very likely happen as early as when half the population is vaccinated if people use masks and distance, if not, then that'd be until almost 70% is vaccinated.</p>
<p>c) As several vaccines, some COVID ones it will require a 2nd reinforcement. Hopefully it doesn't turn into a flu, but models show that as you build immunity over time, new variants will be less aggressive so probably we won't need another shot, if any, in 3 years.</p>
<p>e) Maybe to someone who has not much of a clue on how epidemiology works, but not really. Nobody is making anyone take it, hopefully some don't get it now as there is people more deserving of it at the moment.</p>

        <p>No it does not make you immune.  Dr. Fauci and the WHO have already stated many times that it won't make you immune.  You'll still get the virus.  You'll still have the virus grow and multiply and spread throughout your body so that you'll be able to have enough of the virus in your body to spread to other people.  You won't be able to fight off the virus with the vaccine.  </p>

        <p>Just as any other vaccine that has ever existed does.</p>
<p>None will prevent infection as they are not physical barriers, but will prevent any significant replication and cell death.</p>
<p>Reinfections are well documented and there is nothing conclusive on the immunity infection provides and how long does it last, just as that with ANY other vaccine, the shot will provide better immunity than the pathogen and will make so that there won't be significant (if any) disease.</p>
<p>This self deception is incredible, laughable almost. Not surprising people who think like this never stepped in fucking lab or a science classroom.</p>

        <p>Reinfection hasn't ben proven.  The PCR test has been proven to be extremely faulty.  I can flip a coin and tell you that you've been reinfected.  That's essentially what the Rapid Test and PCR test do.  I can use a coin flip to do the same thing, but that doesn't prove you have been reinfected.</p>

        <p>10 years paramedic, masters in biology. Wanted to comment because i find all the BS you typed up cute. The only thing i feel like hitting on is your first point saying that the vaccine makes you immune to covid. Let me answer that for you real quick, the media has made it abundantly clear that the “vaccine” does not prevent covid. Nor does it make it to where you cannot spread it to others. The only “benefit” is symptom mitigation, but 99% of people that get covid have mild - no symptoms anyways. Huh, weird. Dont come on here lying about shit and then posting your almost “credentials?” To try and grandstand. This entire sub is littered with actual experts and people working in medicine like me who will call you out on your phony bullshit. Bye, study harder in class 😇</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, your credentials mean nothing to me and anyone that is scientifically literate.
If you were someone actually in the field, you'd know that opinions are the lowest form of evidence.</p>
<p>I said immunity, I never said it physically prevented virus replication, that's a given to anyone that took 5 minutes into searching how vaccines work.</p>
<p>All I said is well documented and truth, if you differ you're welcome to present your peer reviewed research that says so. Otherwise, don't waste my time and don't reply again.</p>
<p>May I mention too, I won't listen to an "expert" on internet when the overwhelming majority of actual experts in real life say otherwise ;)</p>

        <p>Ooooooh, a biological sciences student! Stop everything, we've got an expert here! Hahahaha... Let me guess: you're one of those who wanted to become a doctor but didn't have the grades for it and now still tries to play the physician when given the chance, is that what it is?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I leave you with an answer I posted above, it should give you some clues about why your reply is the product of deep brainwashing:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&rt;a) Does the vaccine have any tangible health benefit? Yes and demonstrably so. It prevents you getting infected by up to 95%. It doesn't, as some people have have said, only lessen the impact if you get it but this is something that it also appears to do.</p>
<p>The rate of success of the vaccines going around is still to be defined. "Up to 95%" is rather vague and considering the low death rate of COVID, makes the vaccine unnecessary, at least when it comes to low-risk groups.</p>
<p>&rt;b) Will the restrictions be lifted once everyone's vaccinated? Each country will vary but if we look at countries that have managed this pandemic properly like NZ and Australia restrictions were lifted when community transmission was no longer occurring, not when everyone is vaccinated. What is with the conspiracy thinking around governments suddenly enforcing perpetual martial law?</p>
<p>Australia and NZ have restarted restrictions, in some states even just for one COVID case! Here in the UK, the politicians are pretty open about the fact that generalised vaccination won't mean the lifting of restrictions. Your idea of "transmission no longer occurring" is as naive as expecting the flu to be eradicated. So the logical conclusion would be that no, the restrictions won't be lifted.</p>
<p>&rt;c) Will it be a one-off type of vaccine? This is down to the evolution of the virus as we are seeing with the SA and UK variants and how it interacts with the animal populations that can act as carriers. This is a question of basic science and we may end up in a situation like the flu with annual boosters.</p>
<p>Well, then by the logic used by those who see the vaccine as the way out of lockdowns, it wouldn't work, would it? There's always gonna be another variant, another vaccine, etc. It's not by accident that the value of the flu vaccine has been so contested throughout the years.</p>
<p>&rt;d) Do they want to vaccinate people who are already immune? Remains to be seen as who is actually immune. The immunity of those that have had COVID appears to be temporary and a number of people have had it twice whereas the vaccine driven immunity appears to last longer.</p>
<p>It doesn't remain to be seen. As anyone with knowledge of immunology will tell you once the body builds an immune response to a particular virus, it can no longer be infected by it. If anything, it can be infected by a different strain, which leads us to my previous reply. I don't know a single person who has had it twice. I myself was in close contact with infected people after I had COVID and I never got it again. What you claim about the vaccine-driven immunity is false: it has been the experience of medical personnel, however, that the disease triggered by the vaccine tends to be worse.</p>
<p>&rt;e) Is it suspicious that the governments are so intent on vaccinating everyone considering the answers to the questions above? Given the above why would it be suspicious?</p>
<p>Because it seems that the vaccine is not only unnecessary but also ineffective, so if the government is pushing it so hard, they likely have an agenda behind. Not to mention the strange coincidences and conflict of interests when you look at the people who are the forefront of this campaign.</p>
<p>&rt;Should you have full body autonomy? Absolutely. If you do not vaccinate will you have less privileges than those that do such as restrictions on flying or attending large events, most likely. These things are not rights, they are privileges and subject to conditions.</p>
<p>It's not just about flying, it's about more basic things, such as having a job. Still, I disagree that the examples you mentioned are privileges. They seem like essential rights to me.</p>
<p>&rt;Secondly, when you talk of history repeating itself, what are you referring to?</p>
<p>I'm referring to the various occasions throughout history where the government/king/authority/church/etc used a trojan horse to manipulate the masses to serve their own interests. The witch hunts are one example among many. Loads of people are losing their jobs, going into poverty, committing suicide, abusing their families... Surely if this was just about a virus that kills mainly the elderly and frail, the government would weigh the pros and cons and stop these draconian measures immediately.</p>

        <p>I mean it does have health benefits, mainly preventing the virus</p>
<p>The restrictions will likely be lifted as soon as a significant enough amount of the population is vaccinated or until we reach herd immunity </p>
<p>I mean you need 2 injections for this vaccine and that is all</p>
<p>Yes they want to vaccinate people who have already had the virus because while the body may have fought off the virus, it doesn’t mean you can’t get infected again</p>
<p>And for the last one, you guys are kinda just pushing a narrative for your own goals, I wonder why the government is pushing people to get a vaccine that can put an end to a pandemic and reopen the country. I can’t put my finger on it</p>

<p>See that is the problem we are having. How much is enough? I would think that around 20-25% should be enough, provided that those numbers include the most vulnerable. We already have around 30% (+/- 10% depending on where you live) immune from infections.</p>
<p>But they are pushing more than 85% vaccinated. Why? I don't mind that people at risk are vaccinated. I don't mind people who believe that they are at risk are given a chance to get vaccinated. But why not open after that?</p>
<p>We are not pushing for no vaccination and eternal lockdowns, we are pushing against an eternal lockdown contingent on 100% vaccinations.</p>

        <p>Herd immunity is pretty much the minimum amount of people in the population that need to be vaccinated to prevent the virus from spreading from person to person. So while 20-25% of the population getting vaccinated sounds like it would work, it wouldn’t achieve herd immunity. Imagine there is a room of 100 people and 25 are immune to the virus. You introduce the virus to one participant and leave them be. The virus would likely spread across the population of that room. If say 85 of the people are vaccinated and 15 are not and you introduced the virus to 1 of the 15, it would be less likely to spread from that 1 to one of the other 15. The only way you could reduce the percentage of the population that needs to be vaccinated is by finding a way to slow the spread or infection rate. The ways to do that are increase the distance between the people or by wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>There's no need to completely halt the spread of the virus when almost everyone susceptible to complications is vaccinated. We don't do this for the flu either.</p>
<p>You're also neglecting the existing immunity from past infections. That is what has been driving the numbers down the last month.</p>

        <p>Yes I understand that, I’m just giving the reasoning behind the vaccination percentage that they want. In most cases natural immunity lasts around 90 days according to the CDC but vaccines will probably last a few months at least so while natural immunity works in the short term, vaccination will make it easier for the immunity time to overlap.</p>

        <p>Natural immunity last for at least 8 months, probably for as long as the one from vaccination. Otherwise we would have seen <strong>many millions</strong> of reinfections by now.</p>

<p>The OC43 coronavirus jumped from an animal host to humans sometime in the late 1800s. The Russian Flu pandemic was probably this very virus at work. And today, 130 years later, the little fucker is <em>still around</em> as a common cold virus. It's still spreading. </p>
<p>So when you say that lockdowns can be lifted once herd immunity is reached, you are effectively pushing for endless lockdowns. Covid19 is not going away; it's not going to stop spreading. It will probably outlive all of us. You might as well tell me that we can stop the lockdowns when Jesus Christ returns.</p>

        <p>Does anyone else remember when the doomer narrative was that herd immunity is “a good theory” but would never work? I remember when all the sane people were saying, “lets just open up! We will all get it and then BOOM herd immunity! All good!” Then the doomers would reply and the “experts”, “herd immunity doesnt work”</p>
<p>Now look at them, suddenly herd immunity IS A good idea and all of a sudden hydroxy is a good medication for covid when they basically lynched trump for even suggesting it. Fucking wild</p>

        <p>I mean we could have except that would force the population to face a virus with possible long term side effects and a death rate that, while it seems low, would result in around 5 million deaths if we got 85% of the US infected. That would be like all of South Carolina dying</p>

        <p>I'm gonna post what I replied above, which I believe serves just as well to your comments:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Thanks for your reply.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;a) Does the vaccine have any tangible health benefit? Yes and demonstrably so. It prevents you getting infected by up to 95%. It doesn't, as some people have have said, only lessen the impact if you get it but this is something that it also appears to do.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The rate of success of the vaccines going around is still to be defined.  "Up to 95%" is rather vague and considering the low death rate of COVID, makes the vaccine unnecessary, at least when it comes to low-risk groups.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;b) Will the restrictions be lifted once everyone's vaccinated? Each country will vary but if we look at countries that have managed this pandemic properly like NZ and Australia restrictions were lifted when community transmission was no longer occurring, not when everyone is vaccinated. What is with the conspiracy thinking around governments suddenly enforcing perpetual martial law?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Australia and NZ have restarted restrictions, in some states even just for one COVID case! Here in the UK, the politicians are pretty open about the fact that generalised vaccination won't mean the lifting of restrictions. Your idea of "transmission no longer occurring" is as naive as expecting the flu to be eradicated. So the logical conclusion would be that no, the restrictions won't be lifted.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;c) Will it be a one-off type of vaccine? This is down to the evolution of the virus as we are seeing with the SA and UK variants and how it interacts with the animal populations that can act as carriers. This is a question of basic science and we may end up in a situation like the flu with annual boosters.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Well, then by the logic used by those who see the vaccine as the way out of lockdowns, it wouldn't work, would it? There's always gonna be another variant, another vaccine, etc. It's not by accident that the value of the flu vaccine has been so contested throughout the years.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;d) Do they want to vaccinate people who are already immune? Remains to be seen as who is actually immune. The immunity of those that have had COVID appears to be temporary and a number of people have had it twice whereas the vaccine driven immunity appears to last longer.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It doesn't remain to be seen. As anyone with knowledge of immunology will tell you once the body builds an immune response to a particular virus, it can no longer be infected by it. If anything, it can be infected by a different strain, which leads us to my previous reply. I don't know a single person who has had it twice. I myself was in close contact with infected people after I had COVID and I never got it again. What you claim about the vaccine-driven immunity is false: it has been the experience of medical personnel, however, that the disease triggered by the vaccine tends to be worse.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;e) Is it suspicious that the governments are so intent on vaccinating everyone considering the answers to the questions above? Given the above why would it be suspicious?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Because it seems that the vaccine is not only unnecessary but also ineffective, so if the government is pushing it so hard, they likely have an agenda behind. Not to mention the strange coincidences and conflict of interests when you look at the people who are the forefront of this campaign.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Should you have full body autonomy? Absolutely. If you do not vaccinate will you have less privileges than those that do such as restrictions on flying or attending large events, most likely. These things are not rights, they are privileges and subject to conditions.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It's not just about flying, it's about more basic things, such as having a job. Still, I disagree that the examples you mentioned are privileges. They seem like essential rights to me.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Secondly, when you talk of history repeating itself, what are you referring to?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I'm referring to the various occasions throughout history where the government/king/authority/church/etc used a trojan horse to manipulate the masses to serve their own interests. The witch hunts are one example among many. Loads of people are losing their jobs, going into poverty, committing suicide, abusing their families... Surely if this was just about a virus that kills mainly the elderly and frail, the government would weigh the pros and cons and stop these draconian measures immediately.</p>

<p>Conspiracy? Have you been paying attention at all? Technically not martial law, since that means the military doing it, but it is functionally the same, and has been going on for about a year now.</p>

        <p>Of all the diseases more deadly than this one (measles, chicken pox, tuberculosis), why do you want to bar unvaccinated people from concerts and the like on account of covid? Has an airline ever requested proof of a measles vaccine? What's the obsession with this single virus? </p>
<p>And I'm not talking about nations other than America. Sovereign nations can enact all sorts of batshit rules and non-citizens who live elsewhere have no control over that. But for domestic travel, none of these restrictions should happen..</p>

        <p>Simply because this is a new infection and we do not have either a prevention or a treatment for it. The diseases you mention above used to be killers and it's only because we have effective responses to it that we can be so blasé about them in our lives. If measles did not exist and suddenly it developed, you would be seeing exactly the same response as for COVID-19. The reason that quarantining and lockdowns used to exist in history and then stopped is purely the advancements in western medicine and it's asinine to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>Why should domestic air travel be a right? You have the right to travel in your own car, boat or plane but when it comes to a private company, they get to make the rules and if it comes to restricting passengers to vaccinated ones in order to not be sued into oblivion for putting profit before safety then that is what they will do.</p>

        <p>The airlines can make that rule, yes. But you need to understand that a LOT of Americans are going to refuse this vaccine. And they will still travel. So there will be a tremendous incentive for airlines not to require vaccines in order to capture that segment of the market. If Airline X decides to require vaccines, fine. But it will lose lots of business to competitors that don't. </p>
<p>And yes, this also creates an opportunity for an airline to advertise universal vaccination as a perk of flying with them. I don't see this working out well financially. But a given airline is free to try it. Other nations can enact their own rules and that's beyond the scope of what I can care about.</p>

<p>Because it seems that the vaccine is not only unnecessary but also ineffective, so if the government is pushing it so hard, they likely have an agenda behind. Not to mention the strange coincidences and conflict of interests when you look at the people who are the forefront of this campaign.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Should you have full body autonomy? Absolutely. If you do not vaccinate will you have less privileges than those that do such as restrictions on flying or attending large events, most likely. These things are not rights, they are privileges and subject to conditions. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's not just about flying, it's about more basic things, such as having a job. Still, I disagree that the examples you mentioned are privileges. They seem like essential rights to me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Secondly, when you talk of history repeating itself, what are you referring to? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm referring to the various occasions throughout history where the government/king/authority/church/etc used a trojan horse to manipulate the masses to serve their own interests. The witch hunts are one example among many. Loads of people are losing their jobs, going into poverty, committing suicide, abusing their families... Surely if this was just about a virus that kills mainly the elderly and frail, the government would weigh the pros and cons and stop these draconian measures immediately.</p>
