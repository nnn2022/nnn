    <strong>Amazon workers on 10 hour night shifts</strong>
    <p><p>The global economic crisis, which began long before "covid", led to rise in economic exploitation in every area of work. People all over the planet are losing their jobs, benefits, they're not getting paid their salaries or bonuses etc and all under the pretext of "difficult times for us all". Amazon workers, for example, were told they're now going to have 10 hour night shifts from 1 AM until lunchtime. So pretty much 19th century working conditions. How long until people wake tf up and realize they've been duped? That "covid" is a cover-up for a massive crisis and literally nothing else?  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266369/amazon-ten-hour-overnight-shifts-warehouse-workers#:~:text=Amazon%20recently%20told%20workers%20at,1AM%20and%20end%20around%20lunchtime">https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266369/amazon-ten-hour-overnight-shifts-warehouse-workers#:\~:text=Amazon%20recently%20told%20workers%20at,1AM%20and%20end%20around%20lunchtime</a></p></p>

        <p>A return to 19th-century working conditions is inevitable without resistance. Our vanishing freedoms weren't won because states and oligarchs became nice one day or more 'enlightened' (haha, good joke); they were won by the return of tens of millions of battle-hardened veterans. Those veterans are now dead, or being hermetically sealed off forever. Their torch passes to us. Not just in COVID, but in all things.</p>

        <p>All they have to do is quit and find new jobs.  Minimum wage jobs do this shit all the time.  This is nothing new and it's well within Amazon's rights to treat their employees like shit.  That's why there are other jobs out there.  If everyone walked out, Amazon would have no choice but to improve things, but that's never going to happen.  This leaves them with two choices- suck it up or find another job.</p>

        <p>I do agree with you that it’s all bullshit and definitely a cover up...but if people are out work, I think they would appreciate the opportunity to work the overnight shift. Some people are okay with working nights and it actually helps them. Personally I would never wanna work it, but in theory, I think it’s good to offer more shifts and job employments. I say if people wanna work, let them!</p>

        <p>It's not about "wanting". You have to eat, don't you? Pay the rent, pay for your kids' clothes etc. The Amazon workers are being forced to work 10 hours at night. Even though a hundred years ago it was established a person must not work more than 8 hours a day.</p>

        <p>It's every employers right to put any employee on any shift he or she wants.  Every company has this ability.  The employee has 2 choices: quit or suck it up.</p>

        <p>Plus Amazon is one of the few stable jobs right now. I bet many have no other options and have to stay there.</p>
