        <p>1913 was the start of all of our problems, end the central banks. END THE FED. They are neither federal or reserve, they have successfully stolen all the people's gold and silver. what was recognized as money for millennium is no more since these crooks have fooled everyone to trade their paper, backed in nothing but debt. Buy gold &amp; silver, while you can,  as it is real money and will hold value while they print more paper to crash this system in order to usher in one with even more control by the central banks. CBDC is coming and it will be a whole new level of government control carried out by those who control our governments. The central banks and the federal reserve are behind all of this.</p>

        <p>Look up for Altiyan Childs video on YT. It’s the only video he posted. Look aside his constant invitations to religion and just follow the information he is providing.
Then find Fall of the cabal series on bitchute and watch either all 10 parts or last 5. Keyword is freemasonry. But that is just another veil for a religion that is the oldest but also most dangerous.</p>

        <p>Oh no it all began much much further into the history. It started between 15th and 16th century. At the end of the 17th century they have already had enough control to start with their global plans which we still see unravelling today. Dig deeper!</p>

        <p>The federal reserve started in 1913. Before this time the dollar was set to 371 grains of silver (1792 coin act) and all of our money was backed by gold and silver. Through panics caused mostly by the big banks behind the creation of the federal reserve (America's central bank), congress was convinced to create a central bank to establish economic stability, through which they could print money at will. There was an economic boom as bubbles were inflated, then the great depression. Then in 1933 FDR (biggest crony of them all) confiscated every citizens gold by executive order. In order to prepare for ww2. In 1944 Bretton woods act was established, setting the USD as the world currency because the fact that US owns 2/3 the world's gold at the time. 1963 Kennedy was assassinated a week after defening the gold standard. 1965 silver was taken out of our coins. 1971 Bretton Woods act ends the gold standard, floating the dollar. This is our current faze. 2020 pandemic happens causes central banks to crash fiat in order to usher in CBDC to have much more control over our money and us. Buy gold and silver while dollars can still get it.</p>

        <p>I have already surpassed the level of ‘follow the money’ layers of conspiracy. Now I’m at the level of how long were they hiding this Luciferian religion of theirs and all the cruelty that comes with it. Sadly it’s all true. I wish it wasn’t and I was just a nutcase. That would be easier to accept. Much easier. Take pill and solved. This truth is different and no pills can take that away.</p>

        <p>The thing that pisses me off the most is the hidden satanism everywhere. I’m not religious but sure as hell it does piss me off that there are so many willing to sell their life to something like Satan. That certainly tipped me enough to quit what I was doing before and reject working for them ever again.
Edit; if I regret anything it is the fact that I decided to remain silent while I knew a lot more than I dared to admit. Sorry about that.</p>

        <p>I got tired of the "one eye" symbols and others I learned to recognize in entertainment. I don't know if the Satan stuff is just something used to manipulate the plebes [I think religion has been used as a control mechanism] but it is all over. Something evil is happening. I used to be a Christian fundamentalist, [I see Christianity different, believe a lot was add ons, but still remember a lot of bible prophecy and teachings of Jesus] I don't want the Covid vaxx even for spiritual reasons.</p>

        <p>Problem I see is that they managed to manipulate so much of humanity into projecting and manifesting their dark reality. Of course, they’re now using all the power because in fact they’re weak and losing their grip. Now more than ever. Thank fuck for their oppression, it’s waking people up. My time has come. :)</p>

        <p>Agree they have manipulated most of humanity. I don't know about them losing power, they seem to be gaining it, even with people putting self preservation on the back burner.

        <p>Read Sun Tzu Art of warfare. I cannot prove it otherwise than saying have a look at Twitter or YT feeds of WEF and see disliked vs likes ratios before the shill armies kick in. Check the comments. Without media no one would have been able to see any of their stupid ideas. Think of it. How much fear and violence do you really experience? It’s only there on the TV. They feed on that. But they’re tiny and afraid. Feel it. You can feel it. I’m sure.</p>

        <p>Agree. I shut off the news, I do see some headlines on the internet, but I couldn't take the propaganda and BS anymore. WEF they are basically announcing what they are doing. I used to write on my conspiracy bible prophecy blog the elite announce their plans always if you know where to look. Sociopaths and malignant narcs are always cowards at the core.</p>

        <p>Funny. I worked in broadcast tech; corporate. But I didn’t watch news or TV since 2001 practically. Movies and stuff yes. Now not even that. I just keep seeing the fucking symbols everywhere. Or them spilling the beans between the lines. Which I have also known before but acted the same as sheep; it’s just taking the piss out of tin foil hats. Well, at least my love for freedom of speech and human rights has saved me from my own indoctrination.</p>

        <p>I learned the hand signs, the symbols, etc, I used to post about them on the conspiracy blog. Even studied mystery cults and used to write they played out "rituals" in front of people. I didn't watch TV for some years. I do watch it now but the awareness is there, some shows I won't touch that are nothing but symbol fests. There's indocrination on multiple levels. Yeah they love to take the piss out of the "tin foil hats" like the Simpsons where they sang that certain song at the "lodge" meeting. Few realize a lot of the religions are ruled the same way with same levels of manipulation, leading every demographic where they want them. Glad you have love of freedom of speech and human rights, we need that now as a leading light.</p>

        <p>One thing I have noted and seen others write about is they enjoy the slaves choosing their own demise, some spiritual rule, where the vampires are "invited" into the home like the vaxx into the body.</p>

        <p>Whether you want to believe it or not, they do believe, they worship Satan and they are actively trying to fulfill biblical prophecy.  God is real, Jesus is the truth. Seek and you shall find.  Religion is man made.  Don't follow man, follow Jesus.</p>

        <p>I deconverted from Christian fundamentalism. I was "born again" sincerely. Some may say maybe it took, LOL because I am refusing this vaxx. I had a bible prophecy and conspiracy blog for years. I warned about the elite back then and used to believe they worshipped Satan. Since this happened I still believe they are evil now. They are following EVIL though I may define it a bit different.  I do pay attention to the core teachings of Jesus but know I can't return back to the evangelical/fundamentalist world either.</p>

        <p>I can understand you disliking organised religion but if you are able to see past the veil of what is going on and see the Satanic control, I do think you owe it to yourself to give the gospel of Matthew a read if you haven't already. </p>

<p>Maybe also check out the book of Revelations to see what's coming. </p>

        <p>I don’t actually hold grudges against religions themselves. Obviously there’s difference between one’s personal beliefs and the religious institutions which are for the most part under control of the same group of people which we are discussing about. I’ll give that a read but honestly, for me it’s a bit hard to digest Christianity too. Not that I wouldn’t be already well acquainted with the dogma and all but at the moment I believe that of God and Satan would really exist they’re pretty much two sides of the same coin. I pick no sides, which makes me feel left out but I serve no masters and no one serves me either. Or if we are going to serve, then we serve each other. So gods serve me just as much as I should serve them.
Good and evil are construct of a man, divisive and brutal at the core but both a lie in my opinion. I look at universe abs nature and I don’t see any of that. I will read the link just for the sake of learning another piece of information that may be important on my journey of learning the truth. As for book of revelation or any similar books, I will prefer to stick to intuitive discoveries as I did so far. :)
Thank you for sharing in any case brother</p>

        <p>I read it. Realised I already knew that gospel. I often quite Jesus’s teachings with personal experiences of achieving mental freedom through forgiveness. But I also read between the lines what Jesus said; we’re created in God’s own image = we are God and God is us or everything (even the Devil). And then the most misunderstood and misinterpreted meaning of Help yourself and God will help you. Or with more accurate words; God blessed those who realise their need for him; and who mourn will be comforted. </p>
<p>This is the one that tells me, when we do the God’s work ourselves we get the blessings. Which means I won’t just wait and pray for salvation while there is another group actively manifesting their own reality which I did not consent with. Neither am I willing to put up the other cheek. :)
But I do know that only United in Love we can bring about Heaven on Earth. :)</p>

        <p>I agree. Definitely. Positive thoughts and emotions have an immense effect on the fabrics of reality. Prayer is a mantra. Mantra is the projection of ourselves onto the universe. That’s why the second pic is there. I live this every day. Test it and see it work. We are all divine. Simple as that.</p>

        <p>The idea that we are because we are made in the image of God is absurd really. I can make an alloy that looks like gold but it isnt gold. Humans have no have no power, no knowledge. No control over anything. We don’t even know what gravity is much less omniscience or omnipotence</p>

        <p>I dare to disagree. Modern and still living proof is Wim Hof but there are many which you may have never heard about. We really don’t know much, because it is hidden from us. That’s one. Second, because people don’t have the guts to question it all and test it out. I have once used to think like you. It was a limiting belief at best. Try it.</p>

        <p>I was never not respectful, just straightforward. We simply have different opinions about ego. I don’t believe in universe energy nor human omnipotence or enlightenment.

        <p>I left Christianity [Christian fundamentalism myself] and saw those who would teach that God and Satan were two sides of the same coin. I think religion has been used by the elite to control the masses. I do think if there is a God or divine Source, world religions are just another control mechanism. The teachings of Jesus were altered or added to as well.</p>

        <p>That's the conclusion I arrived at. There's too much in the Bible that serves the ultra powerful in society. I believe hell is something they use to control people via fear. I studied the history of the Catholic church, Constantine et al when I was a fundamentalist. When I read Ishmael, by David Quinn, I realized how much of world religions was about domination. Definitely things were altered and changed. With Jesus I try to pay attention to core teachings but just like you I believe in a divine spiritual called by many names. God is too big too in a universe of two trillion galaxies--the last count for the part 'the real' scientists can see, to be scripted as a man that desires domination and power and control and punishes with eternal hell fire. I studied the bible extensively. The fundamentalist Christians are being USED just as much as any other demographic for the wealthy and powerful, with Dominionism leading the charge. There's a reason Christianity focuses on telling people how broken they are, and obeying authority [most of right wing Christianity pushes blind authoritarianism].</p>

        <p>Thanks, I hope they do too. One thing I faced was why was God [yahweh] scripted so cruel in the bible, even the desire to be worshipped night and day seemed to be a human desire, implanted on a God of their design. Once you strip it all down for the desire for power and control or DOMINATION as David Quinn talks about, you see the desire for CONTROL. I explored archon theories too, gnosticism a bit.</p>

I do consider the Christian god "too small" [the gnostics seem to be on to something about the cruelty of the Old Testament god-the demigurge, and believe Jesus's teachings were changed or added to.

        <p>Yup. That’s how I feel about it. I reject reading stuff, first I feel it and ‘see’ it for myself then reading comes by itself. 
On the seeing part it’s quite funny for me; I have what is called aphantasia. I cannot see anything in my minds eye. I cannot imagine stuff at all. So when I ‘see’ I see like blind people; I feel it all very intensely.</p>

        <p>When I really get visions they’re totally involuntary. I saw children.. dying and screaming in pain. I don’t want to go into more details. If I knew what I saw when I saw it, understood what I saw, I would have surely killed myself. I was too young and too inexperienced to be able to accept that. It’s the same painful now, I still feel all that stuff. But I learned to block the pain, as a child I had to learn that. That’s why I also feel those kids a lot more than other living beings. I know what they’re going through. The only difference is that I was just a victim of a sick person they’re victims of ritual abuses.</p>

        <p>As you know it, I have been basically saying I believe people giving this vaxx to children are monsters and sociopaths. I don't know if your visions mean the children will die of war or the vaxx, but I am very scared for them. I went through very bad things when young, it opens my eyes to a lot especially via recovery, learning how evil works and how it operates.</p>

        <p>While I cannot say whether I would count as enlightened or not.. I feel that love is the most powerful energy we could have researched far better a long time ago. I trust my intuition and this is honestly the level I got so far on my own. And I feel like I’m really not far off. It’s just not trying to interpret that Love the same way as Luciferians would. Nah, different pure love is what I mean.</p>

        <p>The teachings of Jesus as recorded by his direct apostles are pure but I am not sure of the teachings of the Pharisee Paul who never lived with Jesus but supplanted his teachings, or much of the old testament recorded by the Scribes who Jesus mistrusted.</p>

        <p>I agree. My beliefs about Jesus are very different. I am outside of the Christian world, and explore other religions too, but I agree about Paul who changed a lot of what Jesus taught and yes Jesus didn't trust those OT scribes either.</p>

        <p>Hard to explain; I feel stuff and words just pour out of me. And these ‘feelings’ are always right. Like predicting which asshole on a road is gonna cut me off, but I ‘saw’ or rather said ‘felt’ the 9/11 so accurately that I said 4 Boeings and WTC and pentagon are targets 4 months it happened. As for the event, I felt it in 2000 as quote for quote; Something big will happen, everyone in the world will know about it and it will change the way we live in future. </p>
<p>Apart from ushering those words I also felt AI, control, surveillance, police state etc. So 2020 in short.</p>

        <p>What do you think will happen with the vaxx? I had dreams in early 2019 where all these people died around me, even younger, in the dreams I was told [and I am in really bad shape health wise] I would outlive all these people, one group of people I care about all died and the dream was so disturbing, I went to husband and said I was scared something bad was going to happen, like a gunman or fire hurting people in the group of people and I felt scared something really bad was going to happen. Well all the people in this group just about have gotten the covid vaxx. I dreamed of all these people dying prior to Covid, and husband remembers me talking about these dreams, I was even saying Maybe a WAR is supposed to come.....I said two months before Covid something really bad is going to happen.  Some of the stuff I wrote about on bible prophecy and conspiracy blog, has happened. I wrote during the Ebola era, they could use a pandemic to unite the world for one world govt and oppress people and "bring in the mark".</p>

        <p>Many will take it, while they may not see any significant consequences in a short time frame, I am certain they have badly compromised their innate immunity. They will be continuously sick and dependent on drugs/vaccines or die sick. Either way, it’s bad for them. That’s why I don’t mock them or insult them other than being sarcastic. Fact of the matter is that neither by divine or human laws anyone can force us to take it. I already said they have to kill me first, and I stand by it. I do not consent and neither should anyone who values their own ability to heal. Please look up Wim Hof and the science part on his page. That is only scratching the surface of who we really are and what we are really able to achieve. ‘The Science’ club is a lie. Robust science is suppressed. Question everything and question your own beliefs. This is how you are freeing yourself. It’s a tough ride but with each day I am alive it gets more worth it.</p>

        <p>I think many will take it too. I do think most are going to die, and many people I care about and this is very very painful knowing. I won't mock them either. These are healthy people who have destroyed their health life long, I believe the immune system basically has been overridden by the Moderna/ etc "operating system" They also will get autoimmune diseases. The spike proteins will make for deaths the elite can hide via plausible deniability as people "stroke out" or have heart attacks etc. I think an ADE situation is very possible or even a prions one or they won't even be able to fight off a cold. </p>
<p>I do believe the vaxxinated are going to die soon. Three years at top end of time maybe a year for lower end of time.  I've tried to prepare myself for it happening. I would rather die too than take the vaxx. I believe it is a "mark of the beast" of sorts though I spiritually understand this a little bit different. It is basically mammon altering and entering the human dna system, GMO humans and making people sterile too. I would rather be dead [even if covid gets me and I am ultra high risk] then succumb to the system that wants to give poison to endless children who have no risk from Covid. I do not consent either. </p>
<p>I know about Wim Hof. I am a seriously disabled person who has seen the worse of the medical world--misdiagnosis etc, and my trust was always low for them. I do have to use some medicines etc that work, but I agree with you Robust Science is suppressed and the "science" we are oppressed by is a bunch of corporate technocratic bullshit that hates nature, ignores reality and is just out to make money and oppress people. I agree about questioning everything. I think our culture is killing people with toxic food and more, this is just a walk down the slide to death. It is horrifying to watch. Read the book Ishmael by David Quinn too, if you haven't. The Dominators are taking us to this place.</p>

        <p>I watched it live, obviously it all fell together that same instant. This premonition I had was playing out in front of my eyes on TV. I still remember that day as a movie. I yelled out of my lungs; this is a fucking demolition. For both towers. I didn’t even pay attention to building 7 until next day. I just knew it. That was the moment I woke up. And honestly I really rejected much of that for a long time. I couldn’t face the rest of the facts and accept them as true. 2020 helped me get over that and now I feel really free.

        <p>Wow like me, I said it that day, that looks like a demolition, and why the hell did it fall into it's own footprint? Yeah building 7 came up later. There was even that archeitects group that questioned it all. 9-11 proved to me the system was full of lies. It was a wake up call. It got me to see things different that very day.</p>

        <p>You’re not alone. I tend to find them a lot more these days. Just go out to places that feel good and spend time there learning about yourself.

        <p>It’s not hard to admit whether you observe them from the outside or spend working for them two decades like I did. Just the very simple fact that all people are just numbers to them is evil enough alone to me. Then you also have BBC hiding Saville for decades and stuff like that. Don’t get me started. I knew who I am working for and kinda glad I learned so much about that world too but man does that kinda also hurt. I helped them in a way. Maybe this here today is part of my own redemption. Because speaking truth is also dangerous, today maybe even more than ever before.</p>

        <p>I am glad you learned about that world and can help others. Yes the stuff with Saville was sick. I worked in a few systems that had evils going on, like where I saw decisions led by cruelty or racism. I tried to stand up against what I could but I noticed then malignant narcissists ran so much of the show. They do see people as only numbers or for them to profit from.</p>
<p>I have no respect for the elite and high status people in our society, while some are okay, many rose to their positions via family connections, graft, lies, cheating, evil and being cold and without feeling. I am no contact with an abusive "connected" family, they are more mid-level not 1 percent elites but high enough up for me to know how the real world works especially as I got older and my eyes were opened. I try to help and warn who I can. it's made me enemies, have lost friends who knew about my blog and twitter though I am more quiet in real life, not so sure how long I can be quiet IRL too. I notice I slip things in saying, things about the "billionaires".</p>

        <p>I must say I know a lot of wealthy people who are good and do good. Just no one talks about them. But I also met some filthy rich ones and they often feel very repulsive to me in my stomach. So I just have to stay away from that. Also fake people, I tend to really avoid interactions with them.

        <p>Media and technology; social media are trapping people.  They grab attention and don’t let go. And where you focus your attention matters the most. It’s not just what we sense around us but also what we push out from within us. That’s why switching off as much as possible is really step one. Step two, listen and observe every detail of the daily stuff. Listen to your breathe. Your heartbeat. The connections will open themselves as soon as you tune into your own body and vibe. No book here; my own experience.</p>

I talk to some friends on Facebook being very hearing impaired but I am seeing through that manipulation too. I think social media helped make this whole Covid and vaxx thing possible. So yes you are right about the grabbing attention thing, and we have to switch it off and live our own lives where they aren't feeding us propaganda or fear.</p>

        <p>I do meditate and practice mindfulness. I used to explore Buddhism. I agree, I do think one has to silence all the noise to be free of the mess to an extent.</p>

        <p>Buddhism as such can be deceiving. Mindfulness is great. As for philosophy I prefer to pick rather Zen if I have to. But then again, it’s totally Zen to just be You.</p>

        <p>That’s not how it works. That’s wishful thinking and fantasies. How it works is that for example you imagine your favourite car, the colour, the smell, the touch the sound etc. Feeling it all is important. And somehow you align yourself from subconscious along with reality to open more to that ‘manifesting’ in your life. Now you may get lucky and win that car, but still had to buy ticket. Or do something. Nothing comes out of nothing. However, thoughts alone are already energy. Everything is energy. Your thoughts create your words. Words you use create your behaviour. Your behaviour creates your habits. Habits create your destiny.
You’re okay with the way you think but that’s only thinking. Observe life and experience, then you will see how this works and can even be explained with science that isn’t dull and outdated.</p>

        <p>Or let’s say; when my chances against thousands of other candidates were very slim I just knew I want that job. My confidence and belief that I have that job in my hands already has helped me win every one I really desired with a 100% success rate. Using the same CV for years only update to experience of course. And the first significant one I landed helped me leave my country and reach all my wildest dreams over a night.

        <p>Well yeah of course. I cannot expect to fly to the moon without building a rocket. But when Jules Verne dreamt of rockets flying to the moon he sounded crazy. He knew more than that. I’m not trying to say anything is magical or mystical. However, “the science” is far too behind and on purpose to explain it all. Hence we sometimes still rely on poetry instead if I put it that way. ;)

        <p>Take me through the exact steps you would consider manifestation. As I understand it, most people use it to not have to work at all. Granted the subsection of society that considers manifestation valid, I am not exposed to very often. And they, the ones to which I am exposed, are not exactly bright, nor do they care about their future success. They simply want what they want without process. New age sheep I guess you could say.</p>

        <p>Ough in quite many ways; my health, how my kids look like, many opportunities/events in life have been in so called synchronicity. Or I needed 200€ got a scratch ticket which I never buy or whatever, won 200€. Needed more, got an unexpected side job that netted me just that much. Wanted to travel and be paid for it, sure got that too. I mean, I can really go on. And the best part is that my family was so broke we were kicked out of our flat when I was 13. Bullied, and had generally a tough life. I worked through forgiving, gratitude and lots of positive self work. With every effort I have received more. Even my partner is just like I imagined only way more beautiful. And that’s in a nutshell. No visual boards or crap. Just pure desire out of heart. And letting go was the ‘secret’ sauce.</p>

        <p>So all in all, for me it was a good mix of real hard work and manifesting combined. As for people who focus on manifesting money, they fail because ‘feeling’ money is much more difficult than feeling yourself on top of a sand dune in Africa for example.</p>
