    <strong>Some people are completely beyond saving and will never wake up</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone, long time lurker first time poster. Wanna thank all of you for being here. Can't wait for countless bans to pop up for me, should be exciting. Had an expirience last night talking with a completely brainwashed individual and it confirmed for me that some people are truly beyond being capable of seeing the truth. After I had mentioned restrictions would be coming back for both vaxxed and non vaxxed individuals, he proceeded to tell me that he had 6+ years of immunity from his vaccine. I got a confused look on my face and asked him where he was getting his information, to which he proudly stated he listened to daily podcasts from NPR, the BBC and CNN. I literally started laughing, completely natural response for me, to which he started talking about the 600,000 dead and all of the standard gaslighting that goes along with these people. I quickly defused and changed the subject because it was clearly not a conversation worth investing any more time into, but it confirmed what I had already known, the truth does not matter. Science does not matter. Facts and evidence does not matter. They are so absorbed in the lie that no amount of truth or evidence will ever set them free. I am grateful for this place and know that I am not alone, because it can feel like a very lonely world out there amongst the sheep.</p></p>
