    <strong>Defying the "law"...</strong>
    <p><p>...in our neighborhood bar. In our country masks are mandatory in all public spaces regardless of social distancing, except when you're eating or drinking. Smoking in public spaces also got prohibited two weeks ago.</p>
<p>So here we are, sitting at the bar (forbidden) without masks (we dared walk here unmasked too! So dangerous!), without sufficient distance to others, drinking beer and eating snacks (those come out of a big jar, taken out with bare hands! We will certainly die!) with the owner who has his (filthy, just to keep up appearances) mask hanging off his ear and smokes like a chimney. Some friends came in, we hugged and fist bumped.</p>
<p>The funny thing: nobody, not even the bar owner who knows everybody and their dog, knows anybody who got seriously ill of the virus. His elderly parents and all elderly customers and neighbors are fine. I know one person who supposedly had it, but he was asymptomatic. My husband knows one who had a bit of a cough and tested positive. There is no extensive testing like they make it look on the news. My town has 4 hospitalized cases, the police don't even wear masks on their "patrols". It's such a joke. I don't think I'm living in a happy little bubble, it has got to be like this in most places. How long are people planning on living in fear?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I’d say depending where you go, you’ll find none of this social distance shit.  In most places I go, I’d say about 70% are wearing masks.  Out of that 70%, 95% of them don’t wear them properly.  I guess they’re just wearing them so they don’t get thrown out of a store.  But the stores aren’t throwing people out.  I’ve literally had one store, Harbor Freight, refuse me entrance without a mask. My county has 2 covid deaths, both over age 85. I wish everyone would just take the stupid masks off. Probably 5% of people actually wear them properly so what’s the point?  It’s a big act and it’s stupid.</p>

        <p>I live in a province where masks are mandatory indoors. 80% of places don't say shit when you walk in without one. 15% will but will let you go if you say you have a medical condition. 5% wont let you in  no matter what.</p>
<p>IMO its simply a case of some employees and managers being more doomers than others vs others who see how much this is bullshit and wont do anything about it. Also masks are mandatory but  only owners of places can get fined but cops dont seem to be very into the idea of fining owners so it seems many owners dont care at this point either</p>
<p>a mandate is not a law which is why these masks mandates are very wishy washy in terms of how they can be applied. many have this idea if cops catch you without a mask theyll handcuff you and send you to jail  but its really not the case because even they know the mandate is not something that is super legal for them to do and can get themselves in trouble later on.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>most of thee videos of anti mask people getting arrested are idiots who act aggressive and wont leave private property when being asked by the cops. IMo if a business rejects me for not wearing a mask I simply leave and dont shop there anymore dont make a fuss about it and give doomers fuel to film</p>

        <p>In my state, none of this nonsense is a law.  When we were in full lockdown a business opened anyway and doomers were calling the cops.  The cops publicly said to stop calling because the lockdown isn’t a law and they can’t stop any business from opening.  And that’s how the state will get out of the lawsuits they’re getting.  They’ll say “it wasn’t a law.  It was a guideline you chose to follow.” And they’ll win too.</p>

        <p>That's how I imagine most "countryside" places to be. Most stringent laws are in bigger cities.</p>
