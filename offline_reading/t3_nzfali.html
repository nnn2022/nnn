        <p>Of course the doctors won't say it was the vaccine because if the doctors actually did their jobs, they would resoundingly say it was the damn vaccine that killed her. My theory is this, they are either strong arming doctors to say it wasn't the vaccine by threatening to yank their licenses, or they are telling them we'll ruin your career if you dare speak out against the vaccine. No sane medical doctor, coroner or medical examiner would go along with the charade and leave this bereaved family with no answers. I guess, at least this woman didn't die from a bullet wound and then they said it was COVID-19!</p>

<p>Nah, the real answer is they are teaching doctors wrong in medical school and with supplemental material. Doctors are assured the vaccine can cause no such injury, so the answer must be something else. At least that's my hypothesis where I try my hardest to give shitty doctors the benefit of the doubt.</p>

        <p>The problem is that it's not ONLY about death. To be clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No one is seeking to discount that there have been promising and tangible developments in mRNA vaccines over recent years. The question is whether enough historical safety concerns have been solved in these jabs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not only long-term effects, but understanding which populations have any adverse effect and WHY, which we don’t know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The argument is not to try to prevent other people from taking the vaccine, but defending people’s right to opt out. Especially young and healthy individuals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguing that any medical treatment be forced on someone puts the burden of proof on that party to provide evidence of safety; it should be enough that a person has the right to deny any medical treatment, so “reasonable doubt” is more than enough.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So the argument is whether there is evidence of potential medical issues with this new form of medical treatment.</p>
<p>First, a look at the 2016 medical study “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439223/">mRNA vaccine delivery using lipid nanoparticles</a>”. I learned that as of 2016, no lipid nano particle-mRNA (LNP) vaccines had ever been tested in humans because of “unanswered questions,” and also because the tolerance for side effects in healthy individuals is very low (cancer patients are already dying, so doctors will be more experimental to save a life, different than an already healthy person). Note that the corona vaccines have mRNA wrapped in LNP in order to deliver the code through the body’s defenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Currently, no mRNA therapeutic is approved for use in humans, and a beneficial safety profile in patients still has to be demonstrated. <strong>A first clinical application will likely not be a prophylactic vaccine, because the tolerance for side effects is very low for a drug that is injected into healthy individuals.</strong> Establishing the safety profile in a therapeutic application, such as cancer immunotherapy, will be followed by prophylactic applications.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Both the regulatory agencies in USA and Germany, namely, the US FDA, and the Paul Ehrlich Institute, respectively, do not classify nonreplicating mRNA as gene therapy. This, in turn, eases the requirements for preclinical and toxicological studies [145]. mRNA vaccines represent a very exciting application with multiple clinical-stage applications. Currently, no LNP [Lipid Nano Particles]–mRNA vaccine has been tested in patients, because there are still a number of unanswered questions.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So having lower requirements for preclinical and toxicological studies than gene therapy have been one reason why the platform garnered more attention, but still much to figure out at that point.</p>
<p>In “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology</a>,” a study from January 2018, there’s additional progress made with trials, but it notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>that ex vivo mRNA cancer treatment (where a patient’s cells are treated and then re-infused in the body) is much more effective in targeting but also more expensive than in vitro mRNA prophylactic treatments –- “Ex vivo DC [dendritic cell] loading allows precise control of the cellular target, transfection efficiency and other cellular conditions, but as a form of cell therapy, it is an expensive and labour-intensive approach to vaccination. Direct injection of mRNA is comparatively rapid and cost-effective, <strong>but it does not yet allow precise and efficient cell-type-specific delivery</strong>.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that mRNA inhibition of antigen can also have a negative immune response – “innate immune sensing of mRNA has also been associated with the inhibition of antigen expression and may negatively affect the immune response”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another study notes that until only recent developments in the few years before 2018, “The majority of investigations focused on DNA-based vaccines because of <strong>concerns about mRNA instability and the inefficient in vivo delivery”</strong> (“<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5987916/">Nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines</a>…”).</p>
<p>Back to the July 2018 paper, it provides additional information about recent clinical reports that were less promising:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“While preclinical studies have generated great optimism about the prospects and advantages of mRNA-based vaccines, two recent clinical reports have led to more tempered expectations 22,91. In both trials, immunogenicity was more modest in humans than was expected based on animal models, a phenomenon also observed with DNA-based vaccines171, and the side effects were not trivial.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Recent human trials have demonstrated moderate and in rare cases severe injection site or systemic reactions for different mRNA platforms22,91. <strong>Potential safety concerns that are likely to be evaluated in future preclinical and clinical studies include local and systemic inflammation, the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components</strong>."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms54,166 induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity167,168. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Another potential safety issue could derive from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination. Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to oedema” 169. [oedema is “excessive accumulation of fluid, mainly water, in the tissue spaces of the body”]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation [blood clots]170. <strong>Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations.”</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Further research is needed to determine how different animal species respond to mRNA vaccine components and inflammatory signals and which pathways of immune signaling are most effective in humans.” </p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>Part 2</p>
<p>This last study I found the most fascinating: “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631684/">A Comparison of Plasmid DNA and mRNA as Vaccine Technologies</a>” , one of the most recent major pre-COVID medical study that’s cited. Published in June 2019, this provides a clear overview of vaccines technologies as recent as six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 case. As it states, “the vaccine technology alone is not the only piece of the puzzle.”</p>
<p>I learned that mRNA vaccines are inflammatory in nature – “The greater inherent inflammatory nature of the mRNA vaccines is discussed for both its potential immunological utility for vaccines <strong>and for the potential toxicity. This instability of mRNA has been a significant reason for the lack of interest in mRNA as a drug</strong>.”</p>
<p>Also that “The largest number of mRNA clinical trials currently underway, notably for cancer immunotherapy, involve the ex vivo transfection of cells with mRNA encoding tumor antigens followed by re-infusion of the transfected cells into the patient. Because this is a more cumbersome process for making a product than having a non-personalized product in a vial, direct administration of the plasmid DNA or the mRNA to a patient is preferable for convenience, cost, and time.”</p>
<p>Again, noting that most of the research done has been on a different kind of mRNA treatments than the in vitro ones being widely administered under the Emergency Authorization Act.</p>
<p>Along with the instability of mRNA, the immune system response has the potential to be harmful and not only helpful – “In addition, RNA has long been known to be an immunologically active molecule. … mRNA has a number of immunostimulatory mechanisms, which may be useful—or detrimental—for mRNA used for vaccines or cancer immunotherapeutics.”</p>
<p>The study also lists <strong>nine areas that need continued research and development for mRNA vaccines, and nine “Issues to be addressed for clinical efficacy and safety of mRNA related to inflammation</strong>,” including:</p>
<p>• “Potential toxicity of mRNA due to inherent mRNA inflammatory activity, use of unnatural modified nucleoside, and the formulations;</p>
<p>• “Several pathways of RNA-induced inflammation: TLR 3, 7, 8, plus cytoplasmic pathways</p>
<p>• “Known toxicities of drugs containing unnatural modified nucleosides</p>
<p>• “Potential mitigation or enhancement due to formulation of the mRNA</p>
<p>• “Will anti-self RNA antibodies be generated and play any role in autoimmune diseases?</p>
<p>• “Design of clinical trials to detect inflammation/toxicity due to mRNA”</p>
<p>Finally, the paper also addresses an instance where one mRNA treatment for Crigler-Najjar syndrome was halted, and systemic adverse effects in rabies mRNA vaccine testing.</p>
<p>• “Liver toxicity was observed in pre-clinical studies with one potential mRNA therapeutic delivered in lipid nanoparticles for Crigler-Najjar syndrome… These were serious enough to apparently halt the work with this particular entity, or at least that formulation [59]. The formulation of the mRNA was thought to potentially play a role in the toxicity [60], and repeat doses were used. Nevertheless, <strong>this observed toxicity may be concerning for vaccines as well, since even live replicating viruses and viral vector vaccines (which generally are more immunogenic than subunit vaccines) need repeat dosing</strong>."</p>
<p>• “In addition, most of the mRNA vaccines in clinical trials appear to need formulation. The mRNA vaccines in clinical trials against infectious diseases from this same company are described as formulated in lipid nanoparticles, but whether they are the same formulations as those used for the Crigler-Najjar study is not publicly known.”</p>
<p>• “One should also not ignore the reported toxicities seen with the rabies mRNA vaccine [55] that included limited systemic adverse effects (AEs) for the majority of patients (78%) and even grade three AEs in ~10% of patients following doses of mRNA via different routes, although the conclusions were that the vaccine was generally safe. It is not known whether the pre-clinical hepatic toxicity that proved to be a “no go” result for a particular Crigler-Najjar mRNA candidate is relevant to the mRNA vaccine studies from the same company, because, despite the low doses used, the doses and mRNA formulation for vaccine studies may be different.”</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, most people should fall into the average range of the bell curve and quite likely have nothing more than mild or moderate symptoms from these treatments.</p>
<p>However, these studies also confirm my belief that there is a significant amount of research and progress that still needed to be made as recently as 2019, and issues described sound like an understanding of how mRNA interacts with the body and to what extent, so it wasn’t merely a matter of funding or “rubber stamping.”</p>
<p>Even at an accelerated timeline and funding, any advancements or improvement have not had time to be properly tested.</p>
<p>All that to say that there is enough reasonable doubt to not want to rush out for this new treatment, regardless of whether anyone can prove they caused "one death" or not (which no one but you is denying).</p>
