    <strong>How to fight the new normal? Step 1: Be the change</strong>
    <p><p>I am interested in growing this sub to ensure we share ways to fight against the new normal, and don’t just share ways the new normal is infiltrating society. To that end, I thought I’d start some discussion. I think Step 1 is simple: Be the change you want to see in the world. </p>
<p>I’m not advocating for breaking the rules / doing anything illegal, but I do think that living life - as fully as your government will allow - is important. I recommend you do extensive research into your own municipality/region, because I was surprised when I looked into it how much social distancing is <em>recommended</em> vs mandated. For example, non-essential travel is not recommended in my country, but the legal restrictions on doing so vary from province to province, and there were no restrictions between my province and my family’s province. As a result, I flew to visit family last week, even though that isn’t necessarily socially acceptable. Other things this can look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gathering like-minded people for outdoor gatherings of the maximum size, and only following social distancing if it is legally required (again, very location specific). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not wearing a mask for one second longer than required, and not frequenting businesses that require you to wear one (I got off the plane yesterday and the moment I was 6 ft from everyone as we spaced out in the terminal, I took off my mask. I saw another 4 people follow suit after noticing I had done so).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In places further along in the unlocking, chooses restaurants/pubs which do not force their staff to wear masks, over ones that do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not moving away on the sidewalk more than you would usually do for politeness, and certainly not putting yourself in danger (walking in traffic) to avoid others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know some of these seems trite, but I do think we have to fight a ground battle on this one. If meetups are legal, reach out to people and ask to get together. Don’t push if they don’t want to, but let them know you aren’t scared. Maybe they’ll ask why, maybe that will spark conversation, maybe that will change minds. When you do meet up, ask how coronanervous someone is - “Do you want a hug?” - I haven’t been turned down yet. </p>
<p>More people are opposed to the new normal than we realize. We just have to give them opportunities to feel comfortable demonstrating that opposition. Combine that with voting with your wallet by choosing places that reject the new normal (again, within legal boundaries) and we can start the grassroots change we need. </p>
<p>Any other examples / thoughts in this vein?</p></p>

        <p>Love these ideas, especially not jumping out of the way when someone walks past me (outside of normal courtesy that’s existed forever).</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of purposefully and subtly mocking the rules (especially in CA where they are still insane). Specifically at grocery stores:</p>
<ul>
<li>walk down the wrong “one-way” directions in grocery stores</li>
<li>don’t stand directly on the silly 6ft stickers for any lines</li>
<li>re-use a crappy disposable medical mask and have it in my pocket until I get to the grocery store store entrance where the “bouncer” stands</li>
<li>wear the mask sloppily on purpose</li>
<li>take it off on my way out the door</li>

        <p>I don’t want to encourage rule breaking but I am a huge fan of malicious compliance. Taking the mask off while walking through the door is a great example. </p>

        <p>I already kind of do most of that. I only wear a mask if it's required. For taking my mask on I do that before I get out of the car if I'm somewhere where a mask is required. I usually take my mask off when I get in my car. As for the 6ft stickers for lines, not all stores where I live even have that (or I didn't fully notice). I've been using cloth masks, though. I don't always follow the one-way signs (not always noticing) and at one store where I live they disappeared.</p>

        <p>These will be hard to abide by when I live in a city (Los Angeles) that requires the use of face masks at all times, in every store and establishment, by every employee and patron. </p>
<p>I follow the established rules because I still need to access food and goods, but I immediately take the mask (I refuse to wear a mask that looks like a muzzle. Instead I wear more of a cloth/bandana looking covering) off upon exiting. </p>
<p>Going out is depressing with all of these measures. Inevitably I drive home feeling pissed off or defeated because of the dystopian bullshit I just stood in line for — the plexiglass barriers everywhere, the endless signs telling me what I can and cannot do, telling me where to stand and where to walk, people running in fear if you so much as approach them in an aisle, the unsmiling faces and dead eyed stares of the masses of sheep who simply acquiesce, and just generally being made to feel powerless and oppressed. I genuinely don’t know how we are not seeing more people lose their shit and start freaking out refusing to go along with it. </p>
<p>None of this shit should ever be looked at as being normal. It is the complete opposite of normal or healthy.</p>

        <p>I figured but thought I’d ask anyway. </p>
<p>At some point, I do think non-violent civil disobedience becomes appropriate... but again, that’s a privileged view since it assumes you can afford the fines/time off work if you’re arrested/bail. </p>
<p>There was another suggestion in this thread for Meetups that somehow identify other anti-lockdown folks. I hope you can find some way to connect with people in LA.</p>

        <p>Exactly. </p>
<p>How do you protest when the consequences for protesting become a financial burden for you?  I can't afford to get arrested or fined. So I comply and that is a sick truth I have to sit with every day. </p>
<p>This new sub and the r/lockdownskepticism one are my only two lifelines keeping me sane at this point. Reddit is the only social media I use. I do wish that I could meet people in my immediate area. I was already super isolated before the lockdown, but now it's just so much worse because I feel like I can't express myself here without being attacked or dismissed.</p>

        <p>I live in nyc. I’ve only worn my mask at a small pharmacy. I just ignore it. No one has said anything and I nod to other non-masked people like you do to someone driving the same car as you. It kind of helps that there are so many people and I’ve noticed other people taking their mask off when they see I’m not wearing one.</p>

        <p>Ha. That’s good to hear. It’s eerie how compliant Angelenos are. I really did not expect it. </p>
<p>“No mask, no service” is posted everywhere and strictly enforced here. </p>
<p>The other day I went to get gas and ran inside to pay, forgetting to lift my mask up to my face for the less than 3 second interaction I had with the clerk. I was immediately told to put it on. She was already behind a huge shield of plexiglass. What threat do I pose?? </p>
<p>Just utterly ridiculous. Part of me wants to argue with these idiots but all I can do is shake my head.</p>

        <p>It feels extremely oppressive here. I don’t know what is wrong with these people. I see people outside walking with masks on when no one is even around. Likewise people wearing them alone while driving in their own cars. </p>

        <p>Hey, I'm in LA, too, and I feel exactly the same way you do.  I try to avoid going out as much as possible because I absolutely cannot stand dealing with the BS going on now.  It's very depressing to see what has become of our lives and how dystopian society is at the moment.  I also feel hopeless when I see that no one is taking a stand against these nonsensical rules.  The only place I get some relief is walking around the UCLA campus.</p>
<p>The mask thing is what I hate the most.  I had to go grocery shopping the other day and I kept my mask underneath my nose for most of the time.  I found it to be more comfortable because I could breathe better.  I also stared down anyone who looked at me, lol.  I wear a light cloth scarf and I literally pull it up as I enter the door of the store and have it removed as I exit in front of the security guard.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get together like-minded people in the LA area to start seeing what we can do to put a stop to these measures because it's very oppressive here and I can't take it anymore, really.  If you're interested, feel free to PM me.</p>

        <p>Ah. We are on opposite sides of the city but that sounds good. Glad to hear you are making these efforts. </p>
<p>Sometimes I think it’s best I don’t go out anymore because the idiocy is just too much to take in without wanting to scream. Yesterday I finally lost my cool in public and went off on some young guy who was uselessly slow while I was forced to stand in a huge long (socially distanced) line to simply purchase one item. I saw all these kids who looked like they had just come from a protest and I wanted to say, “Why didn’t you guys protest this lockdown shit? Why did you buy it so easily? Why has your protest been legitimized while any other type of justified protest was laughed off as selfish and stupid?”.</p>
<p>Needless to say,  by the time I got up to the front of the line, I was pissed. It’s getting harder and harder to hold my tongue.  I don’t want to be written off as a right wing Trump supporter (I am not one) or conspiracy theorist (not that either). Anyone who doesn’t have the common sense and critical thinking ability to see that none of this shit (especially 3 months later) is about public safety is a complete moron and deserves to have the rest of their lives dictated to them.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I only go out shopping once every 2 weeks because I’ve realized it’s best for my sanity that way.  I’m actually in the Valley, but I go to UCLA once a week because I feel normal there and can just walk in peace.</p>
<p>Exactly, I don’t get how people cannot see the hypocrisy of supporting one type of protest and demonizing another. The media has definitely made us outcasts and many people have bought into that, so they don’t want to be associated with the anti-lockdown crowd. It’s insane to me that people still cannot figure out that this is about control and manipulation.  Oh yeah, I’ve been labeled as a far right conspiracy theorist whenever I question any of the contradictions about the lockdowns, virus, or protests. It’s like, wtf is happening?!  I can’t believe this is real life.</p>

        <p>I live in Florida where mask requirements don’t exist by law. Some businesses may require them, but I choose to not shop there unless absolutely necessary. Retail stores were allowed to fully reopen as of Friday. Meaning at 100% capacity. Some stores still are playing games, such as “private appointments” in order to enter the stores. Others are requiring masks and gloves. I’ll play the mask game because they reopened, but I firmly refuse to wear gloves that actually spread germs more!  I also refuse to shop at stores that are allowed to reopen, but still choose to play silly games such as appointment only shopping. I do feel bad because some of these are small businesses, but it isn’t just small businesses. IKEA, Best Buy, and others are still playing foolish games. Listen, you are allowed to open, so open!</p>

        <p>Eh, you are assuming management is competent enough to pick up on the anti lockdown minority not shopping in IKEA. They are not that smart or attentive, this is why the vote with your wallet argument falls on its ass in niche situations.</p>
<p>More over, they probably will just assume people are still too scared to come back, so they will add more temporarily abnormal measures.</p>

        <p>I've slowly been "coming out of the closet" as a lockdown/New Normal skeptic and starting to speak more openly with coworkers and on social media about our "normal living" activities. I've been talking about our summer travel plans, posting check-ins at restaurants we've been eating at, places we're taking the kids, etc. </p>
<p>I would LOVE if there was a way on Meetup to find like-minded locals. I've learned we are pretty much alone in our views within our existing friend circles. I personally have struggled with this, though, as my general political views are pretty moderate, so I am turned off by a lot of the more extreme right-wing and Libertarian groups who might be meeting or meeting up specifically to rebel against The New Normal. I don't want to meet up and talk about politics, I just want to meet up and talk about normal shit, like movies and music and families and jobs.</p>

<p>He is one of the smartest people I know and tends to be right of centre.</p>
<p>Nope i had to send him an apology text. Currently the UK is so toxic there is no point trying to win hearts and minds, you are more likely get fired than change someone's mind.
I am going to keep a lid on it and practice mild disobedience with my one pair of friends who are also anti lockdown. Once furlough ends and we are three months after that point I think the UK will start to turn around.</p>

        <p>I never wore a mask while doing outdoor activities (I’m a big runner). I never really bothered with the dumb arbitrary 6ft rule; I’m not moving into the middle of the road and getting hit by a car to avoid you! </p>
<p>The good thing is I’ve met up with my friends to do runs and there’s not too much social distancing going on. We’re not on top of each other, but we’re close enough to run and talk and just enjoy ourselves without taking up the entire trail. I need to start driving to placed more and meeting my friends for runs and just getting back to enjoying life as it was meant to be enjoyed. </p>
<p>Of course there will be some Karen that calls you out, but the more and more that people act normal, the less and less it will happen - at least that’s what I think. It maybe a hackneyed phrase, but “be the change you want to see in the world!”</p>

        <p>The people jumping into the street are insane. I walk two hours a day, and it happens multiple times. I saw one guy actually get clipped (he was fine). I also saw a lady jogging in a mask and - shocker! - faint in the street. 
I refuse to risk my life because some dimwit is scared of a damn flu. I'm not enabling their hypochondriac nonsense.</p>

        <p>Went to seaside board walk today, hardly anyone in masks stores and stuff were open. Sadly I think the fun things for kids are really gonna take a hit, the aracades and such.</p>

        <p>I've been doing all this since the beginning.   I would also encourage people to not participate in any zoom/virtual events.  I don't want to go to a virtual wine tasting or virtual anything that I can do irl.   The new normal is trying to drive us closer to a mostly online existence and I have no interest in supporting that.  Share any real life events on social media.  My state has slowly started up with local live music and some other smaller events (outside art shows and such) I share the hell out of them on fb.  Do not support any business that still chooses to operate as curbside only when they're allowed to open their inside space.  Keep living your life as unafraid as possible.  People need to see other people living without fear as much as possible.</p>

        <p>I don't wear a mask, don't follow the arrows. I keep my distance from people but I don't jump off the sidewalk to do it. I go out for drives since this whole thing started and I haven't stayed home.</p>
