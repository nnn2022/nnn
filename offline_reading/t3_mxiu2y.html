<title>This is probably one of the best reads out there. A person who got vaccinated but believes people shouldn't be forced to get the vaccine thinks we should open up. It's nice seeing vaccinated people starting to wake up even if they aren't fully awake yet.</title>

        <p>They're just realizing that the carrot of getting their freedom back by following all the "rules" was a huge lie. They do say some rational things too, but nowhere do they address the fundamental issue that we are not going to be "given" our rights back, no matter how many "rules" we follow. </p>
<p>We get our freedoms back by taking them back. Living our lives. Hugging our loved ones. Evicting propaganda from our brains. And realizing that our rights were born with us, not given to us by some corrupt politicians. We go back to living normal lives, and the whole game crumbles.</p>

        <p>I do not believe this is a rare occurrence. I know dozens of people who have been vaccinated, but none of them would say you have to and all of them want things to open up. Which is why they have gone about their lives as normally as they can.</p>

        <p>Anti-lockdown and anti-new normal since last March and I chose to get vaccinated. If someone doesn’t want it, that’s none of mine or the government’s business. I have family who said they aren’t getting it and I couldn’t care less. If I’m vaccinated then I should be immune, and there’s no danger to me (at 27, there never was anyways). But I’m not asking for special favors for being vaccinated. Treat all people equal, vaccinated or not. We all deserve to have our freedoms back and if they won’t give it to us, I’ll join anyone vaccinated or not in taking those freedoms back. </p>
<p>Enough. Open the country, stop this divisive nonsense.</p>
