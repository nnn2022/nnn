    <strong>Situation in Greece</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Greece. Here the situation is pretty rough. We have been in a bad economic situation for many years even before covid. Restaurants, cafes etc have been closed since October and won't reopen at least until March. Shops opened again two weeks ago but the government is discussing closing them again. Masks are mandatory inside and outside. Even when you are walking alone. People are allowed to leave the house only if they text the government number stating where they are going and have to be back in two hours. There is a curfew at 9pm till 5am where no one is allowed to be outside. There is a 300 euro fine if they catch you breaking any of these. The minimum wage here is 520 euros. Many people make less than that. Our prime minister proposed that the fine becomes 500 EUR but took it back after public outcry.
The absurdity is obvious. 
But lately I've been hopeful because I see both left wing and right wing people realise that all this isnt happening for our own good. We are being played. Laws that are horrible for the greek economy are being passed while we cant protest because of the prohibitions. We are the second country in Europe with the most anti democratic measures. Maybe it is wishful thinking but I feel like we are very close to our breaking point.</p></p>

<p>First Lebanon and now Greece. Greece has had 10 years of economic challenges and was just starting to recover. Why are they doing this?</p>

<p>This is not a left vs right issue. This is about the most basic freedoms being curtailed.</p>

        <p>I agree one hundred percent. I've seen people in this sub supporting that left/leftists are prolockdown which was the case here too, but not anymore. I feel like the absurdity of the measures and all this pressure helped some people who were supporting the lockdown at first, realise that something is wrong.</p>

        <p>Greek here: I left the country and I am not planning to return except for visiting family and for vacations. You are totally right. The situation in Greece is unlivable and everyone can plainly see that the measures have nothing to do with any pandemic, but they are a result of the dictatorship aspirations of the politicians.  </p>
<p>To make things worse, the middle class is licking the government's shoes (μενουμεσπιτάκηδες), the media are in it too - without ANY exceptions - and Greece became effectively a dictatorship, while at the same time having one of the lowest death rates in Europe.</p>
<p>I hope you make it - many of my friends there are close to their breaking point, and I already know of Greeks who left the country (or who are seriously thinking of doing it) opting to move to eastern Europe, outside the EU because of this.</p>

        <p>Are Covid deaths in Greece mostly among the elderly, as is the case in the U.S.? What's the feeling toward Covid vaccinations?</p>

        <p>Yes, most deaths are among the elderly and people with underlying diseases. I think people are sceptical towards the vaccine. The population is pretty divided on that one. The pressure of the government about getting the vaccine plays a huge role. They want vaccinated people to have a vaccination certificate and there have been claims that people won't be able to work without it or even go to a bar.</p>
