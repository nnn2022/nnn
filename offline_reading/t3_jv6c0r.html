    <p><p>Apparently, they deem that as denying covid and gave me a temp ban.  Did that sub get overrun by doomers?  Mild doomers, but doomers all the same.</p></p>

        <p>I caught your comment before it was pulled. It was much stronger than what you imply here. You said no one had even seen or isolated the virus. And there was no evidence of its existence. Also claiming that FDA says no test can find the virus.</p>
<p>While I am not here to fight, nor do I have the expertise to change your mind, that sub does not allow things like this. I am surprised you only got a temp ban.</p>

        <p>All of which is true.  No lab has yet isolated the virus which is why tests cannot be used to diagnose it.  Its symptoms completely mimic influenza so not even that can be used as a diagnostic tool.</p>
<p>You can't verify a vaccine's effectiveness if you can't even verify that someone has the virus.  That cannot be denied or overlooked.</p>
<p>The virus hasn't even been proven to exist.  No test can detect it. FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>(page 38)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.  •The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.•The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.•This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</p>
<p>(page 39)</p>
<p><strong>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available,</strong> assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza.  Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage.  The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April.  That was proven without any doubt.  Influenza kills children and young adults.  Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it?  Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you?  I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019 Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html</a></p>
<p>And here is an article from the New York Times that states that 90% of all covid tests should have been negative.  That's 90%!!!!  So no one is dying of covid!</p>

        <p>This was my point exactly. This is a very misleading claim. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The virus has been isolated more than 1,000 times across the world. Infact they have even used it to infect animals such as monkeys and hamsters to check for vaccination efficacy and masks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure of a rapid test does not mean virus doesn't exist. It means the test is poor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have seen that quantified isolates document being misinterpreted across reddit. It is not what you think it is at all. It's a lab procedural document that is more than 5 months old.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NY times article is about exaggerated positives. Where high cycle thresholds of PCR tests pick up remains of the virus. That means someone might have the virus on them, but they may not be infectious.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all common knowledge. Again I am not here to fight. I'd suggest you look for information with a more open mind.</p>

        <p>Addressing each of your four points.</p>
<p>1.Interspecies cross infection was disproven from the beginning. We KNOW that the "virus" did not come from eating a bat. They have not isolated the virus what they have done is they've recognized certain genomes and had a computer model fill out the rest. This is an educated guess at best but it is still a guess. This is further corroborated by Dr Tom Cowan in his <a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/10/19/dr-tom-cowan-explores-the-covid-virus-invented-out-of-sheer-nonsense/">article</a> titled:</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tom Cowan explores the COVID virus invented out of sheer nonsense</strong></p>
<p><em>“First, in the section titled ‘Whole Genome Sequencing,’ we find that rather than having isolated the virus and sequencing the genome from end to end, they found 37 base pairs from unpurified samples using PCR probes. This means they actually looked at 37 out of the approximately 30,000 of the base pairs that are claimed to be the genome of the intact virus. They then took these 37 segments and put them into a computer program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs.”</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, the sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was done by assumption and arbitrary inference. If this is science, a penguin is a spaceship.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A poor test cannot identify something accurate so yes the existence of the virus is still in question due to there being respiratory illnesses prior that have the same symptoms as covid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes this document is 5 months old but when we look at the timeline of events, particularly the onset of Operation Warp Speed, it is interesting that the document comes out 6 months after the start. Which begs the question what template exactly are they working with/on?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, high cycle thresholds of PCR test pick up remnants of the virus but only remnants nothing live or that can be "cultured" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Vy6fgaBPE">as Fauci said here himself</a> in this interview. Currently the PCR test are ran at 40 well above the 37 cycles Fauci criticized in the interview. They have not decided on what viral load is considered infectious and that is revealed in this document from the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> :</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"</em></p>
<p>Seriously no offense but I think you are mistakenly interpreting all of this.</p>

        <p>Then imagine how much prestige you could make if you could provide one document that proves that this virus has been isolated.  And also, if the virus has been isolated, why is every single hospital in the entire world using tests that don't check for viruses?  Neither one of the tests do that.  The Rapid and the PRC tests check for responses, not for viruses.  Even the PCR test's creator has stated in public interviews that the test was not designed to test for viruses.  A fact seconded by the FDA in the test's documentation which I quoted to you.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire world, no hospital is testing for the virus.</p>
<p>Also, hasn't the CDC declared that this virus is airborne and therefore not blocked by masks?</p>

        <p>Testing does not mean isolating. It is extremely expensive to isolate a virus and requires lot of infrastructure. Tests perform poorly because they look for signs of the virus at the cheapest possible cost. </p>
<p>Also I am genuinely surprised that you are doubling down on the "virus hasn't been isolated" claim. How do you think they infected animal models or human cells? How do you think they did a genetic analysis of the virus? How do you think they know there are various strains of it? Your claims seem very odd and I am surprised that you hold them.</p>

        <p>I agree that the virus is not worth any consideration, but the tests labs are performing are.  Doing the tests as badly as they're doing them ruins lives and continues the fear and misinformation the media is spreading.   If the labs would do the tests correctly (at 30 cycles) then we could all open back up and begin rebuilding without masks.  The only thing keeping all this going are those falsified test results.</p>

        <p>That's bad. You know not only it cannot be verified, but even for known issues like say influenza vaccine if you want to prove a vaccine works, you can't, because there is no independent access. There is no way to independently trade, analyze, test, verify anything because these are restricted unknown substances. So all there is, is a belief fueled by propaganda. The only ones who really know are the manufacturer and their associates. And I see no reason they will ever state something against their own "creations"</p>
<p>There are DIY vaccine projects but of course nobody talks about them and mainstream will tell you these are bad because of course the market must be monopolized (since 1906)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://radvac.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/White-Paper-SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-ver-3-3-0.pdf">https://radvac.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/White-Paper-SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-ver-3-3-0.pdf</a></p>
<p>It's there, of course without isolating the pathogen this targets whatever RNA sequence is documented.</p>
