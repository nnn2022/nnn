    <strong>Worked with a Vanderbilt doctor today</strong>
    <p><p>I just wanted to spill this information with y‚Äôall. I live in TN and I work in healthcare. I spoke to a Doctor today specifically about our state and COVID. He said Vanderbilt has finished an 8 week study on the vaccine to better understand how it works by having vaccinated staff and non vaccinated staff self-test with PCR tests daily for 8 weeks‚Äî these are the staff members working directly with COVID patients (all of which are morbidly obese and or already have respiratory issues which is why they are unable to recover at home like the majority of people). Out of 100+ participants in this study, 0 caught COVID that were vaccinated and 1 caught COVID being unvaccinated. He said their findings further prove a few things...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The virus is not as contagious as first thought (which we all already know here) so long as good hand washing procedures are followed which...of course they are in our field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vaccines are ‚Äúefficient‚Äù, in his opinion and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They now will continue with their other studies to have it be that once 70% of our particular city of Nashville is vaccinated, no one, including those unvaccinated, will have to mask unless the particular business still requires it (for example healthcare facilities). Our governor does not support vaccine passports ‚úîÔ∏è </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>His prediction is that by June of this year, other states also doing these studies will come to the same findings and with that, MSM will be begin reporting about masks not being needed for things like grocery shopping, going to the gym, going to restaurants and bars, etc... he stated that Biden being moderate will be good here because even as a Democrat he knows the virus will not be eradicated, we all know that now, and by June, so long as COVID ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù are similar to flu ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù, Biden <em>could</em> make the call to leave masking up to the people...thus MSM reporting that? This was the only opinion of his I was weary on as a National thing.</p>
<p>Within our conversation he also said that he believes WITH THE INCENTIVE OF: Get vaccinated, no more masking‚Äî more people would be willing to get vaccinated so we can ALL go back to...‚Äùnormal‚Äù</p>
<p>I wanted to share this to open a discussion with other Americans. I‚Äôm very glad to be in a red state but I am in a blue city so it‚Äôs interesting crossing county lines and seeing 0 masks as opposed to most being masked within city limits (yes, even in their cars alone ü§¢)</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for being respectful in this discussion!</p></p>
