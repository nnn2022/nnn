    <strong>How Doomers justify Texas</strong>
    <p><p><strong>If Texas cases go up:</strong></p>
<p>- Obviously, it was because they removed the restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>If Texas cases go down:</strong></p>
<p>- Because they vaccinated a lot of people.</p>
<p>- Because it's still too early to tell.</p>
<p>- Because there's plenty of other reasons that also influence the cases, such as Summer approaching (and the end of flu season).</p>
<p>- Because it's Texas and you can't compare States because they are all different.</p>
<p>- Because people in Texas are still wearing masks and taking care of themselves.</p>
<p>- Because the State is hiding the real number of cases.</p>
<p>- Because it was going down anyways and it would have gone down even more otherwise.</p></p>

        <p>I really don't understand why these people want to cling on to Covid-19 the way they do.</p>
<p>They aren't even sincere in their "fear." They have behaviors that prove that over and over again. It's something else. Maybe the sense of identity it gives them, or the sense of feeling like they are important and better than others because they wear 2 masks. Or maybe they enjoy the power over people. Or maybe they have a Walking Dead pandemic fantasy.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, their fear isn't real. They do all kinds of other behaviors that will give them real health problems later. Most of them are fat. Most of them get very little exercise. They live sedentary lifestyles and eat junk food.</p>
<p>And boy, they don't want to let it go. They are clinging to the lockdown &amp; masks, probably because they had no lives before the pandemic and it gave them "something" to have interest in.</p>
<p>Now it's over and soon they'll have to face their real issues. Maybe they have no significant other. Maybe they don't have the children they wish they had. Maybe they have dead end jobs with no hope of advancement. Maybe they have no social life. Maybe they have no hobbies, so outside of work and outside of pushing the Covid-19 agenda -- they're bored.</p>
<p>I don't know what's wrong with them, but the way they cling to Covid-19 shows how mentally ill they are...</p>

        <p>I've seen a lot of them say the cases are down because there's less testing. </p>
<p>Which began the question - If a pandemic only exists when you're looking for it, is it really a pandemic?</p>
