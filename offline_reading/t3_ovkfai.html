    <strong>The reason why covid deaths are praised on reddit...</strong>
    <p><p>Finally this clicked and it seems quite obvious in hindsight. Why do people on reddit share news articles of covid deaths, especially with the borderline fantastical taglines like "He begged for the vaccine but it was too late!".  </p>
<p>Here is why... When you live your life in fear mode you expect others to do the same. I've known people that have come home from grocery shopping when this all started and sanitized every single bag / item they got. These are the kinds who flip out in line if you encroach upon the magic 6 foot viral shield, they wear masks in their cars and outside... and the notion of them not wearing one indoors at a public setting is just too much for them to handle.  </p>
<p>We have done the opposite of this. We've lived life. Some of us have had to of worn masks because of your work place or just to make everyday life a bit easier, but the social distancing? The arresting fear of covid sneaking up on you and killing your friends and family? Eagerly awaiting the vaccine so that we can post it on social media to let the world know we are putting up a good fight? NONE OF IT. Again, we have just lived life.  </p>
<p>... and we are all still here. Because of that, it enrages them. They cannot comprehend HOW we've broken these golden rules of society to stop the virus and yet none of us are dead. How can this be? They're telling themselves "I did everything right. I wore the mask. I socially distanced. I spread awareness, I distanced myself from the conspiracy nuts killing off everyone with their asymptomatic spread" - yet here we are. Both totally fine.  </p>
<p>So when they see a news article detailing a covid related death it validates their last year+ of living in complete paranoia. "Phew, that could've been me! He got what he deserved". The supply of "reckless" anti-vaxxer deaths does not meet the demand, and any scraps that can find that validates their theory of this - hypochondria is good - they will use.  </p>
<p>Anyway, just a thought.</p></p>
