        <p>IDK if it's really good news. We're pretty fucked if Dong's telling the truth.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In addition, Dong has provided DIA with the following information:Early pathogenic studies of the virus we now know as SARS-CoV-2Models of predicted COVID-19 spread and damage to the US and the world<strong>Financial records detailing which exact organizations and governments funded the research on SARS-CoV-2 and other biological warfare research</strong>Names of US citizens who provide intel to ChinaNames of Chinese spies working in the US or attending US universitiesFinancial records showing US businessmen and public officials who’ve received money from the Chinese governmentDetails of meetings US government officials had (perhaps unwittingly) with Chinese spies and members of Russia’s SVR<strong>How the Chinese government gained access to a CIA communications system, leading to the death of dozens of Chinese people who were working with the CIA</strong>Dong also has provided DIA with <strong>copies of the contents of the hard drive on Hunter Biden’s laptop, showing the information the Chinese government has about Hunter’s pornography problem and about his (and Joe’s) business dealings with Chinese entities</strong>. Some of the files on Dong has provided shine a light on just how it was that the sale of Henniges Automotive (and their stealth technology) to Chinese military manufacturer AVIC Auto was approved.Again, according to sources, Dong told DIA debriefers that <strong>at least a third of Chinese students attending US universities are PLA assets</strong> or part of the Thousand Talents Plan and that many of the students are here under pseudonyms. One reason for using pseudonyms is that <strong>many of these students are the children of high-ranking military and party leaders</strong>.As we initially reported, DIA has high confidence in the veracity of Dong’s claims. The fact that since our original report, which was pooh-poohed by Langley apologists, the New York Times published a rare interview with Dr. Shi Zhengli (the WIV “Bat Woman”), ABC News has started an “investigation” into COVID-19 origins, and now the actual name of the defector has been published in an anti-Trump, CIA-friendly blog, demonstrates what sources told RedState today: “This defector has the rest of the intelligence community and the LEO community scared sh**less.”</p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>Look at the sentences in the article such as "and that he flew to the United States in mid-February, allegedly to visit his daughter at a university in California", or "Dong Jingwei (董经纬) defected in mid-February, flying from Hong Kong to the United States with his daughter, Dong Yang" .</p>
<p>So here's the story : </p>
<p>China's vice-minister of spys is allowed by Xi to have his daughter study in California during a trade war, and permitted to take a civil plane from Hong Kong to the USA, with which China is currently at cold relations, during this pandemic period.</p>
<p>Quite credible huh?</p>
