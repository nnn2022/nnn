    <strong>I went into a police station without a mask</strong>
    <p><p>My wife had to go into the police station yesterday. There's heavy fines for entering a gov building without wearing a mask, so I said I'll wait outside because I didn't have a mask. While I was outside, near the entrance, I saw at least 5 cops coming and going without masks. </p>
<p>After about 10 minutes waiting my wife came out and said I could come in. The officer my wife was dealing with said I could come in provided I didn't sit too close to him, because his superior might get him in trouble.</p>
<p>So I went in without a mask and waited for a good 30 minutes. No one said a thing to me. Many cops weren't wearing masks. Some had them around their chin. </p>
<p>I get the feeling most of the cops are now just playing along with the Covid-19 security theatre to satisfy their superiors.</p></p>

        <p>A lot of cops are aware this is bs, especially when they get a call to an accident, and the M.E. (medical examiner) comes along, and instead of saying it was a car crash, says 'oh, must be convid'. then collects $30k or whatever amount.</p>

        <p>I agree. I seldom see LEOs in my area in masks. In fact, I was recently in a minor car accident and the responding deputy arrived unmasked and said not a word about myself and the other driver being sans masks.</p>
