    <strong>Why are they giving the Covid vaxx to stage 4 cancer patients?</strong>
    <p><p>I know someone who has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, a close online friend, she has been given 2 years to live at most. She told me she got the Covid vaxx. I had warned her but to be honest 95% of everyone I know online and offline has gotten it, and told her it is people's choice. </p>
<p>She knows I am against it, but we kept peace. I was upset. I know another cancer patient local acquaintance, who must have a more sane doctor because from her FB postings seemed she has not gotten it due to being "immuno-compromised". I don't know if the vaxxed friend got any side effects or not, she's so sick in general, it would be hard to tell. I just don't understand. </p>
<p>They want to put the already ill and sick at risk with it. When something has no medical contradictions that is suspicious. They want to give this stuff even to people with severe autoimmune disease and more and who are on chemo.  To keep peace with this friend, I am not talking about vaxx to her and just said it is your decision. She has enough on her plate too. I just do not understand. I felt like I was grieving that too.</p></p>

        <p>I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your friend... fuck cancer. So many peoples doctors are ill informed and don‚Äôt know as much as everyone thinks they do. My coworkers neighbor passed away from cancer, his doctor told him to drink Gatorade to stay hydrated üòë my aunt died from pancreatic cancer. She was also a diabetic and drank diet drinks and used sweet and low in here tea/coffee, her doctors had no issue with that. I saw a statement yesterday from the wish campaign, they want everyone to be vaxxed (family members and sick children included) before their wishes can be granted. It‚Äôs the quiet cull.</p>

        <p>Yeah forget "Make a Wish" foundation, pushing that crap on sick and disabled children. I don't think the doctors know as much as people think either, there are some good doctors and some bad ones.  Yeah all the sugars and chemicals in those drinks are bad news. Gatorade always made me throw up.</p>

        <p>Definitely some good ones and some bad ones. Stoked to see the good ones are starting to step up. Sad part is you have all these assholes screaming follow the science! Listen to the doctors! Then you give them doctors and science who are like nah y‚Äôall are killing people here‚Äôs the proof. Then they turn around and do everything they can to smear said doctors.</p>

        <p>yes evil as hell. They don't care what happens to those kids in the future, most all ready are battling severe health problems. That's sick. Again the nature of these false vaxx are exposed on the very fact they want to give them to the medically contradicted, and they don't care what happens to them.</p>

        <p>I was poisoned with refrigerant at a job in nova scotia. </p>
<p>My bosses laughed at me, wcb laughed at me, the doctors laughed at me. </p>
<p>They made me wait 9 months with my blood pressure in the 170/110-200/160 range. I consider it a miracle I didnt end up having a stroke or anything major happen. I do believe I did likely suffer some kidney damage and I still have some floaters. Which look like little squiggly lines. All things that WCB should be checking up on since they let this happen to me. </p>
<p>Good thing I am appalachian, I have always and always will be on my own. </p>
<p>To this day I am still told that freon cannot cause irregular heartbeat and that I did not have it. </p>
<p>They cant even make up a good excuse to deny my claim, they can just outright lie and there is literally not a thing I can do about it. </p>
<p>Frack mainstream society, I don't know how most people sleep at night. Oh wait they dont thats why half the population is heavily medicated.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm so sorry I love you I promise there are good people out here even if it‚Äôs few and far between. Before finding out I had cancer my parents and doctors called me a liar and even laughed at me as I was on the floor dying in excruciating pain from a tumor wrapping around my spine and it was only when I started breaking out in petechia all over my body that anyone believed me. It really is a cruel world.</p>

        <p>I think something is wrong with our medical establishment while some are good, the system is broken, they discount patients, call them liars, and rest, that happened to me in my 20s and one reason I am disabled today. You know having life ruined by a medical dictatorship now is hell on earth to me, like a reminder of medical nightmares I've had everyday. I would have perferred even a war compared to this. Hope you are doing better.</p>

        <p>Sorry you went through that, it sounds horrific, and then to laugh and ignore your symptoms is sick, I guess they think freon is non-poisonous, what idiots. Hope you have supporters and some close people in Appalachia, in regular America all social ties are broken up.  It sucks that they kept lying, I think this happens to many people to save companies money. Yeah most are heavily medicated or drugged out to be checked out.</p>

        <p>I've almost died of misdiagnosis, misdiagnosed with two later conditions diagnosed even by a team of doctors. Written off and severe symptoms ignored. One problem took 25 years to get diagnosed. I kid you not. I am sorry you faced mistakes in the hospital. I almost died in hospital from IVs failing and if a good doctor didn't show up at 3am to do a throw down on my behalf I would not be here.</p>

        <p>&rt;Dear Dr. Fauci,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I understand the need for the various stages of testing a new experimental vaccine, but in listening to you give a timeline for any new vaccine for the corona virus, it struck me that perhaps a modified approach might be considered. Why not allow early use of a vaccine that has passed a phase 1 safety testing, similar to what was done for the Ebola vaccines. If a vaccine is shown to be reasonably safe, why not allow its use it in more at-risk people (elderly , smokers) before phase 2 trials are finished . It could also be helpful as with the Ebola vaccines to prevent transmission in hot spots of community acquired infections. There doesn't seem to be much downside compared to the potential for preventing many more deaths than was seen in the Ebola situation.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Sincerely yours,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Bill Buikema , William J. Buikema, PhD, Research Associate</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Riddle me this.</p>
<p>If old people are the ones more susceptible to death, due to many contributing factors. Why would you test a experimental vaccine on them first?</p>
<p>The answer?</p>
<p>It's so when they die, you can just blame it on "pre existing conditions". The exact same reasoning they gave all the blood clot vaccines to the older people first.</p>

        <p>it's not the motive of the doctors, it's the motive of the globalists who own pharmaceutical companies, media outlets and politicians, who dictate these policies. 
They don't really need to profit off of one terminally ill patient, they can basically print money. They have bigger things in mind.</p>

        <p>I'm quite convinced at this point that a lot of people have somehow become convinced that it's impossible to die from anything other than Covid. I mean this quite seriously: a lot of the truly ridiculous things, like giving the vaccines to cancer patients, makes a lot of sense in that light.</p>

        <p>My cousin passed away earlier this year. She had stage 4 non-Hodgkins lymphoma. It was sitting right on her lung. Fought it for 5 long grueling years, but she always kept her spirits high. So deep in her faith. She was in remission for about 6 months when they found another tumor on the opposite lung. They wanted to try another kind of clinical trial on her. One she had never done before. They also NEEDED her to get the COVID vaccine to be able to start treatment. She could not start treatment without it. So...she goes through with it. New clinical trial that she has never been on AND the COVID vaccine given just days apart. She was fine for a week, then she started to get very sick. Immediately when she felt strange she went to the ER. They sent her home. A day or so later she was back in the hospital and the symptoms were getting even worse. In a matter of 2 days she was in ICU on a respirator and on the 4th day pronounced dead. We still don‚Äôt know what truly happened and my aunt never did an autopsy. She was too devastated. They couldn‚Äôt figure it out in time. They tried treating her for what they thought it was...and I don‚Äôt know the exact medical terms on this but I am 100% convinced that her body was not strong enough to take on both of those things. But she couldn‚Äôt get the treatment without one! It‚Äôs extremely upsetting but I try not to be angry I am trying to help other people who may be going through a similar situation and have doubts. Now in this case it wasn‚Äôt just the COVID shot but the combination of a COVID vaccine and the clinical trial...but I would still be VERY leary of this. It should not be mandatory. Period. She had been through chemo, radiation, 3 clinical trials (I believe). She had one good lung, a bad heart, her body was beat down from years of treatment. Why they would think this is acceptable, I do not know.</p>

        <p>That's freaking INSANE. Also how would they know the side effects of the clinical trial opposed to the vaccine? This is where thoughts that they WANT to kill people off comes into play. Her doctors sounded like idiots. There's no way her body could take all this on and then to blackmail the decision telling her they wouldn't give it to her without the vaxx is evil beyond belief.</p>

        <p>I left her alone and did not tell her, she is fighting off cancer. I did not add to her burdens. I already warned months ago. How much choice is involved when she is under the gun from terminal cancer and probably had people pushing this on her in a medical establishment night and day?</p>
