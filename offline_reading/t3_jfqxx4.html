    <strong>This is also about attention. The medics, nurses and health scientists have never had so much attention as before. They are the origin of the narrative.</strong>
    <p><p>Just wanted to bring this factor to the table. In a world where our Maslow pyramid base is fulfilled, attention becomes very important. In this hyperconnected world with social media, TV's everywhere, it's too easy not to search that gratification.</p>
<p>It's hard to let go the stage, the show must go on. Remember hospital personel were being clapped few months ago.</p></p>

        <p>It's more about the virulogists and public health grads. You are right they are loving this along with Bill Gates.  And they tell half truths because deep down they need this thing to keep going to keep the newly found power and attention.</p>

        <p>You’re absolutely right. What’s worse is the health department workers. Some of them barely have nursing degrees or not at all. Now they get to play dictator and the power has gone to their head.</p>
