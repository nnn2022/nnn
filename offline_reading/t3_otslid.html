<p>go a bit more in depth in thinking about why this is the case for other vaxxes and why this wouldn't be the case for the covid gene therapies. keep in mind the gene therapies only reduce symptoms and don't prevent spread. Even viral count is unchanged.</p>

        <p>Well it's not that it doesn't work. </p>
<p>It's like: it offers a 75% chance of protection. But if I'm in a room with 3 other people who are also vaccinated than that accumulates, because they each also have 75% chance of being protected.</p>

        <p>My man. You're talking stupid. Dr Mengele, I mean Fauci, just yesterday said that the viral load was just as high in a vaccinated person as in an unvaccinated person. So either this vaccine protects you from infection, or it doesnt. My participation has nothing to do with it to you since my viral loud is staying the same.</p>

<p>No, I don't believe this is their reason at all.  I think they just want to control other people and virtue signal.</p>
<p>I think there is a small percentage (mostly those with other major health problems) who have been scared into getting the vaccine.  But for most people I really do just think it's about belonging to what they consider to be a prestigious club.</p>

        <p>So the argument is that vaccinated people still get and pass it along. But it reduces symptoms. So less hospitalisations. They want everyone to get it because a vaccinated person doesn't want to come up to a non vaccinated person and pass the virus (which was not serious to them) to the unvaxxed where it could potentially be serious. </p>
<p>I'm not vaxxed though because statistically the Vax is fucken harmless to my age group and we shouldn't be worried about getting covid anyway unless you're old or have health issues, in which case get vaxxed</p>

        <p>Also, any vaccine only works on the individual- when you go to a country that has, letâ€™s say a high prevalence of yellow fever, you take the yellow fever shot to prevent you from getting YFâ€¦ itâ€™s not to make sure that you donâ€™t pass it onâ€¦ Which made me think why on earth should it matter to the next person if Iâ€™ve taken the cvid jab???</p>

        <p>You can get covid and spread covid. You might get some symptom relief with this "vaccine". Even the symptom relief sounds suspect. I mean how can you prove if that person would of caught covid they wouldn't of had the same symptoms? Sounds like a secondary prophylactic or pre-treatment. Doesn't even work as a therapeutic. The evidence doesn't make it sound any better than ivermectim or hydroxychloroquine. At least those drugs are proven to be safe. Should not be mandated and we should not be freaking out about covid.</p>

        <p>Personally, the more I think about it the more I consider starting the discussion from this point has already given too much ground to the Pro-Vaxxer.</p>
<p>From now on I'll be pointing out that the PCR cycles are too high (Even his esteemed High Chancellor Fauci declared 35 cycles was too high), Flu was reported to be extinct, Kary Mullis - winner of the Nobel peace prize for inventing the PCR test - is on video talking about the pitfalls of high cycles.... and now we have the FDA rescinding EUA of PCR tests as they can't differentiate between Flu and Covid.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In my opinion there's no point in even taking the discussion further than that. If it can't even be established that there was a pandemic in the first place what's the point in talking about policy, vaccines and treatments? Don't even give them the ground.</p>
<p>If they are blind to that then you're dealing with a mindless golem. No amount of talking and debating will ever convince them unless they come to the answer on their own. It's best to just leave the situation and avoid them if you can.</p>

        <p>no itâ€™s because they want their freedoms back and freedom is being tied to vaccination and they think if the magic number of people arenâ€™t vaccinated covid wonâ€™t go away and we will never be free.... theyâ€™re too moronic to understand natural immunity theyâ€™re too moronic to understand that even if the vaccine lowers viral load which weâ€™re seeing now isnâ€™t necessarily the case it still doesnâ€™t stop transmission and infections theyâ€™re too moronic to understand itâ€™s them that is driving variants which will keep covid around forever. theyâ€™re selfish and entitled</p>
