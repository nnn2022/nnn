    <strong>Felling sorry for close friends that are willingly wanting to take the vaccine without second thoughts.</strong>
    <p><p>So I've got a quiet wide group of friends around the world.</p>
<p>All the covidiot Vs doomer mentality can be reduced to one group no trusting authority and the other to trust them blindly accepting that the power at be has the best interest at them.</p>
<p>I can't really blame the doomer or even the not doomer but the ones that trust authority to have their best interests in them. Is easier for them to go to sleep thinking that their, family, children, friends are in good hands. Is easier to think that there's no conspiracy, is easier to think what the herd do, this way you have no responsibility of your own thoughts.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day it all boils down for them as why would they not have the best interest, why would they want to harm you and your family. In their mind there's no space to under the desk deals. So becareful when they ask you why would they do this. Although you can have an idea as why the power at be would they not have the best interest in your health to the point to want to kill you or sterilise you becareful what you answer, because we don't exactly know why, so let's stick to facts that already happened. </p>
<p>What are good examples of powers at be trying to do harm to the population in the past/present? How to talk i to dear people to have second thoughts about getting the vaccine without hesitation?  I love some of these people and I wouldn't like to see them harmed let alone dead. They aren't bad people, they just think that the people in power has the best interest in them, they trust authority because they don't see reason why they wouldn't. </p>
<p>How to try to make them reason?</p></p>

        <p>I dont. They are lost. At this point I care about my well-being, which is best served not listening to ignorant &amp; uninformed assholes.</p>
<p>If you find a way, let me know. But the propaganda has started long before this whole thing happend. Anti-Corona = Anti-Science = Trumpism = Climate Denial = Rassism... thats the narrative. Maybe you have different experiences, but it is quite insane the things I suddenly became accused of when I was argueing for self-determined health-care.</p>

        <p>Your well-being depends a lot as well on your surroundings. There's no way I could feel good if my friends would die in the near future due of getting a experimental shot (aka vaccine) which is showing to have had lots of controversy in really short time. </p>
<p>Look at Italy, they give the astrazenica vaccine to young people, that vaccine is forbidden in other countries and here they give it to young people.</p>

        <p>Indeed. But, Im a freedom loving person. If I want to discuss a topic with you and you dont want to discuss that topic with me, Ill let you be.</p>
<p>The people in my life taking the vaccine have made it very clear that they dont want to talk about it. Or at least not about anything that could conflict with their believes.</p>
<p>Again, Im open for suggestions. Its just, I have found there are people who are open for conflicting information and others arent. Trying to convince someone who doesnt want to be convinced is a waste of time.</p>

        <p>I think is more about reasoning or having a fair debate more than convincing them.</p>
<p>That's why I was asking for times in history when power didn't have best interest in us and using science as an excuse.</p>

        <p>I tried with several close friends [long distance and online] and two locals who had side effects from the vaxx on first dose. All my arguments failed. In my case I did cover things a little citing my own health problems which is a concern but the majority did not listen. One even close friend of 20 plus years ignored me, went to get vaxx for a job that laid him off only weeks later. I tried too. I even have a personal blog where I have links, like studies and articles people post here, and I put everything from animal studies to Dr. Mike Yeadon's warnings and a few of those websites that track vaccine deaths. I probably have lost a few friends who have access to my blog. </p>
<p>That didn't work either. I never imagined people would trust authority this much. It's really thrown me for a loop. Make sure to take care of yourself. Prepare for disappointment. I am seen as the "crazy" conspiracy Aspie, while a few were nice thinking well you do have serious health problems many see me as nuts for questioning the entire narrative.</p>

        <p>We have a WhatsApp group and is very hard to put my thoughts in a way that I don't sound nuts for them, I dont want to convince them not to have it, but I want to convince them to be aware of what they are getting into and not to be proud about it thinking that is totally safe and proven as they think it is. One of the guys in the group got it and said he had side effects from it and another guy said you're probably just paranoid and is in your head. They aren't ignorant people on the opposite they all travelled a lot and speak languages, world people but in this case is very hard to inform them.</p>

        <p>I struggle with this too. My closest friend who is generally very distrusting of the government (he’s from a country with a dictatorship) came to Canada for a better life. He has accepted that the dictatorship is worldwide now and will get the shot so he can travel and have fun. </p>
<p>His brother is a doctor who is gung ho on shots and he’s basing his decision on his family getting jabbed and having no long term reactions. </p>
<p>People will live their lives the way they want amigo. With a heavy heart sometimes we have to let go.</p>

        <p>Friendship for me is: </p>
<p>Honestly
Trust
Respect</p>
<p>Any of this missing and is not friendship. </p>
<p>If I can't say to them what I think they are getting into specially if this involves a possible life treating situation then I guess I'm not a friend.</p>

        <p>Save yourself. That's the only certain victory against evil you are able to influence. All else is bonus, but expect to lose most of your friends, and be in heavy discussion with family, for a time to come. Vax apartheid is rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>FYI, the same people behind all major wars are behind convid. They have no mercy, no regret in human harm, especially if taken voluntarily by the population.</p>

<p>For me friendship is being able to be honest being able to debate with respect.</p>

        <p>The chances of them getting horribly sick or dying from the vaccine is at least double the risk of from covid. But also remember that doubling such a tiny number is still. A tiny number.</p>
