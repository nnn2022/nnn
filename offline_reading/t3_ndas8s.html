    <strong>Family wants to get vaxxed. How can I try to convince them to wait longer?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, so my family wants to get vaxxed. Parents around 60, father may be considered at-risk (smoking + blood pressure medication), brother 30 and healthy. 
So they came over to my place and in our region(not USA) they announced vaxxes for everyone. They have appointments next month. I was at a total loss of words and could only say that corona viruses existed before covid19 and I'm not getting vaxxed because I don't want to get boosters every 6 months (they didn't knew about that, what a surprise). So I'm trying to figure out how I can convince them to skip their appointments for now. Any inputs appreciated. The only thing I can come up with is to send some horror stories but IDK I think the brainwashing was already done.</p></p>

        <p>Tell them this, and make sure to show them the evidence:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% IFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently‚Äîif someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace ‚Äútuberculosis‚Äù with ‚ÄúCOVID,‚Äù it‚Äôs suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual IFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu‚Äôs .13%, it‚Äôs not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>

        <p>You can't stop them, nagging is just gonna strain things. Mine all insisted, and they've <em>all</em>  been in the hospital at some point in the weeks since, every aunt and uncle on one side. I'm angry they were so dumb but I just avoid the subject now because they made their adult decision to get it and they were going to do it regardless. Everyone is gonna make their own decision in the end and trying to stop theirs ends up making them resentful of you.</p>

        <p>ask them if they're comfortable with the lack of liability protection for a vaccine that's not FDA approved.. those are 2 points that are not up for debate, and will either make them think about what they're doing or proceed in blind faith..</p>

        <p>1, you do not need a booster every 6 months.  Scientists are questioning the need for boosters right now, it's still not known exactly how long the immune response lasts  That issue has not been settled for most of the vaccines. </p>
<p>2, coronavirus has been around for ever but Covid-19 is a mutation of the virus of which there are many including SARS.  They all effect us differently. </p>
<p>3 If your high risk father wants to protect himself and be around for many years to come instead of slowly suffocating to death or suffering long term organ damage then you need to ask yourself who the crazy one is for wanting to expose him to the risks of Covid..  It's his choice and stop using inaccurate information to push your opinion.</p>

        <p>Maybe keep your mouth shut and let them get vaccinated. 1.5 billion people have been vaccinated worldwide and everything is fine. Your "horror stories" are bullshit urban legends. If there were really any danger it would involve a global conspiracy of millions of doctors, politicians, scientists, the media, law enforcement, insurance companies as well as billion-dollar corporations. It doesn't make any sense unless you are a crazy person. Sorry. You simply don't know what you're talking about. At the very least you need to quit looking for attention and mind your own business.</p>
