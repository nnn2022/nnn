    <strong>The Full Leak From The Whistleblower Within the Liberal Party of Canada, Back in October. You Wanna Something Scary? Everything is Going According to Plan, According to This Leak. Wake Up.</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;For the longest time, I refused to believe that letter leaked to the press in October 2020 was legit. It seemed to far fetched. However… I have to admit that its been right on point so far…</p>
<p>&rt;“Dear REMOVED,
I want to provide you some very important information. I’m a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning committee (which is steered by the PMO).</p>
<p>&rt;I need to start off by saying that I’m not happy doing this but I have to. As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes.</p>
<p>&rt;The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:
– Phase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020. CHECK</p>
<p>&rt;– Rush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020. CHECK</p>
<p>&rt;– Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020. CHECK</p>
<p>&rt;– Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 – early January 2021 CHECK </p>
<p>&rt;– Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021. [We are here]!</p>
<p>&rt;– Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021. [It’s happening]</p>
<p>&rt;– Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 – Q2 2021.</p>
<p>&rt;– Enhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021. [Talks of it in France. Quebec and Ontario follow France usually by a month.]</p>
<p>&rt;– Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.</p>
<p>&rt;– Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021.</p>
<p>&rt;– Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021.</p>
<p>&rt;“Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians. What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief.</p>
<p>&rt;This is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program. In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever. </p>
<p>&rt;The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada’s HealthPass) .</p>
<p>&rt;Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told “the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details”. Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling.</p>
<p>&rt; Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate. When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely. And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.</p>
<p>&rt;So as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I’ve ever witnessed before. In the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not. That it wont just be Canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas. That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone. The members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored. Our opinions and concerns were ignored. We were simply told to just do it.
All I know is that I don’t like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future.</p>

        <p>It was a hard night when I read this back in October.  And then lots of instant push back from media like Rebel News - made me think at the time maybe it was just an elaborate story. </p>
<p>Then in November, we went into "phase in secondary lockdowns" on a rolling basis....</p>
<p>And I've been fighting hard ever since!</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if we could get some corroborating documents on this? Another French one came out at the same time. The calendar one. But if it's real there has to be more.</p>

        <p>If this is real (which I doubt), their fatal mistakes were including mandatory vaxxes and making the forfeiture of property ownership permanent. Those 2 things would create far too much pushback in every population on earth, with resultant casualties among the enforcement puppets of the engineers. Can't enforce a power grab like this without living enforcement personnel.</p>

        <p>The property thing makes no sense to me at all. A lot of people in Canada don’t have debt right now/could sell their cottage/income property etc. And be debt free. Prices have gone up 30% in less than a year. </p>
<p>Anyone who bought a house prior to 2020 has a lot of equity. If it was a second, third, fourth property, they can afford to sell one and live mortgage free. I’m 32 and could be mortgage free right now by selling my rental property and paying off my actual house. If I sold my main house and lived in my rental, I would not only be mortgage free but have hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank. </p>
<p>Poor people already don’t own anything. </p>
<p>All you’re left with is middle class people who over extended themselves. People who kept borrowing against their houses to buy a boat or furniture or something. </p>
<p>Why would anyone work if they can’t get ahead? Our military and our police are all middle class citizens. Why would they ever enforce stealing property. Like they want to be attacked on a daily basis for stealing property while making 100k a year and not being able to do anything with their salary? </p>
<p>And if they do, are they going to replace every single roof, window, furnace etc.? Are they trying to act as a landlord for 33 million people? It just doesn’t make any sense.</p>

        <p>Yes! Thank you! I'm glad to see someone else has thought this through on a practical level. I agree with every word you said and I'd also like to add that even the people "underwater" on their properties (owing more than the current property value) or trying to get out from under a punitive mortgage might consider relinquishing their <em>current</em> properties in exchange for a clean debt slate. However, there is no universe in which they would freely agree to sacrificing all future hope of property ownership. </p>
<p>As for the landlord to several billion people worldwide question, my darkest speculation is that the parasite class have a goal of reducing the population and herding them into so-called "smart" cities (open air prisons) while destroying all rural real estate, so their fantasy is they wouldn't have to deal with repairing anything. Their hubris knows few bounds I'm afraid. </p>
<p>What they haven't accounted for is human nature, and that is a good thing. No one is going to sacrifice what they've worked years for without a fight. And people without hope/driven into a corner can be extremely... persuasive... in fighting to preserve what they have.</p>

The home of Microsoft and Amazon and this state's data is total shit! These people lie. They lie all the time...even when the truth would serve them better. It’s in their nature.
