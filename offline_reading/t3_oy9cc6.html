        <p>Then don’t do either. Actually look at the data itself which says:</p>
<ol>
<li>Covid is low risk for death if you are healthy</li>
<li>However there are many serious side effects if you survive that happen at fairly high rates, long covid, neuropsychiatric problems, blood clots etc. </li>
<li>The long term effects of covid infection are not known but based on what we’ve seen there are likely to be many (e.g., <a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/covid-19-linked-with-alzheimer-s-disease-like-dementia">possible increased risk of Alzheimer’s</a>)</li>
<li>Vaccines so far are safe and effective</li>
<li>The long term side effects of vaccines are not known but there is no theoretical reason why they should be harmful</li>
<li>The data so far on vaccines does not suggest there will be significant side effects in the future</li>
<li>Therefore current risk of covid complications (including death) outweighs the current risk of vaccine complications in everybody without specific contraindications to the vaccine.</li>

        <p>On one hand you highlight the speculative long term effects of covid-19, while on the other hand dismissing the speculative long term effects of vaccines — all while deciding by your own subjective standard that one side of your speculative scale weighs more than the other? Seems like logic fit for the craps table at Caesars on the strip instead of public policy (assuming your own subjective standard would permit Caesars to be open). So far, eating 7,000 calories a day hasn’t killed me. Does it mean it will in the future? Or not? </p>
<p>The truth of the matter is relatively nothing is known about this disease. Government has proven hugely unable to handle it and the public is starting to ignore them at higher rates. The fatal conceit of assumed human calculation ability once again rears its ugly head. </p>
<p>Oh and to top it off — Moderna is a largely unsuccessful company with an abysmal track record, Pfizer has been fined dollar amounts that make some NYC investment banks look like Jesus Christ, J&amp;J is full of racists, and do we need to talk about the debacle that is AZ? </p>
<p>I don’t suppose you’ll want to come to the defense of large multinational corporations, but then again 2021 has seen very unlikely political alliances take shape.</p>

        <p>&rt; the speculative long term effects of vaccines</p>
<p>Which are? What theoretical long-term effects could we speculatively see?</p>
<p>&rt; all while deciding by your own subjective standard that one side of your speculative scale weighs more than the other?</p>
<p>It’s not so subjective. You take the lists of side effects of covid and side effects of the vaccine. Put them side by side. Add the estimated rates at which they are experienced. What are you left with?</p>
<p>A massive list of possible complications of the virus, many of which are actually relatively common, compared to a vaccine which has a small handful of incredibly rare complications. The risk of thrombosis alone in covid infection is greater than all of the serious complications of the vaccines put together (most of which are, incidentally, also thrombosis). </p>
<p>So please tell me, what is the logic behind thinking that the latter is likely to be more risky going forward?</p>

        <p>Thing us authorities like WHO or CDC even contradict themselves from what they write in their documents and what they or the media say. This is just one little thing amongst plenty of others but it's much too late here for that</p>

        <p>This dumbass is over at forwardsfromgrandma chatting with other idiots about brigading r/NoNewNormal. The funny part is some of them were complaining about getting banned from other subs for posting here. The irony which was lost on them was one loser claimed that the reason other subs ban people for posting at r/NoNewNormal was because the members were brigading. Haha</p>
