    <strong>The "50¢ Army" is making us feel like we are alone.</strong>
    <p><p>No, "The 50¢ Army" isn't a cute name for rapper 50 Cent fans like Justin Bieber's "Beliebers". It's a group (that I just learned about) of payed keyboard warriors with no conscience that get paid for posting and commenting the official narrative on various social media sites. We call them shills. These people are paid 50¢ per interaction and have opinions that go something like:</p>
<p>Biden is great and won the election fair and square and him sniffing kids is completely normal behavior that's not creepy at all, you are selfish if you don't get vaccinated, All white people are racist, citizen gun ownership is dangerous, Trump supporters are racist terrorists, people having a comfortable lifestyle is causing global warming, Covid 19 is the worst plague in history, China has the best form of government and all countries should be more like them, anyone who can get over the border from directly south should be allowed in but if you are unfortunate enough to be from anywhere else in the world, that doesn't apply to you, and you must go through the process that takes years (and you still may not get approved).</p>
<p>I know people struggle with money, but I don't know how someone can live with themselves and get paid to write what they are told. It's literally selling out (which sure doesn't seem to be as taboo as it used to be). I'm sure some of them agree with what they write. Maybe some are indifferent. </p>
<p>The stats I've hear is that there are currently around 2 million of these contractors that are full time, and 20 million that are part time. That's a lot of spewed bullshit! </p>
<p>I wish more would blow the whistle but I guess it's too good of a gig to lose. Plus there's probably a non-disclosure agreement signed. I would love to see what the training looks like.</p></p>

        <p>I don't know about that.  It seems to me like an evolution of a practice used by legacy media for years.  For example, an actor on SNL says something edgy and political but completely out of step with reality and the laugh track kicks in.  Viewers at home think, "I guess that's how I'm supposed to feel too."  So they do.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's pretty sad really.  Also, the US basically created Communist China.  Look up Frank Coe.  He was one of, I'm sure, many State Dept. goons involved.  He was eventually exposed, but there were no consequences for him.  He just retired to China and probably lived pretty well for the rest of his life.  The West had a hand in the creation of Communist Russia too.  Check out Malcom Muggeridge's book, "Winter in Moscow" for a picture.</p>

        <p>Oh yea obviously. We’ve had a massive bot net for years now influencing people through social media.  They post extremist stances on both sides, all for the sake of causing confusion, animosity, and fear. 
Just google “Russian bots twitter” and you’ll find plenty to read up on. I think twitter was banning millions a month at its peak.</p>
