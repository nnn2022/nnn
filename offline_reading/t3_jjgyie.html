        <p>Wonder if she got put on a ventilator. She claims she got it in March when they were putting people on vents like Oprah handing out cars. I have a theory that all these "long term effects" are caused by ventilators, especially lung damage.</p>

        <p>This can’t be serious. Why would they put someone on a ventilator?! Ohhhh that’s right cause they couldn’t breath on their own. </p>
<p>People don’t just get put on a vent just because. It’s a last step. There are MANY things you do before placing someone on a vent as it CAN do damage to your lungs, trachea, etc. but it’s better than dying!</p>

<p>Yeah, that's how it should be, right?  But it doesn't seem to have been the case at first.  Early on I think we can all agree that we were hearing a <em>lot</em> about ventilator shortages because it seemed like they wanted to throw everyone on ventilators.  How much do you hear about people being put on ventilators now?  Additionally, here are a couple of sources from back in April discussing how medical experts are re-thinking the use of ventilators: <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-analysis-recommends-less-reliance-on-ventilators/">Source 1</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ventilators-specia/special-report-as-virus-advances-doctors-rethink-rush-to-ventilate-idUSKCN2251PE">Source 2</a>.  Clearly there was a change in philosophy here.</p>

        <p>Great points! It’s a novel virus and we are still learning about it. That’s one of the great things about science and medicine. We can admit when we are wrong to better the patient and get better outcomes. We practice evidence based medicine; however, that is difficult when there isn’t any evidence to go off of (I.e. COVID19). So we are using things (ventilators, BiPAP, Steroids, etc) that have worked with conditions that COVID can cause (ARDS for example). Ventilation with PEEP is very useful for ARDS and COVID-19 causes many people to develop ARDS</p>

        <p>Agreed!  That's my only point though: whether you want to call it irresponsible or not (and I'm not a medical expert so I can't be calling it irresponsible), the fact of the matter is ventilators were (based on reports) used frequently early on, and subsequent analysis suggests that that ended up not being the right call.  It's certainly possible that some people died that wouldn't have as a result of unnecessary ventilator usage, or at the least suffered long term complications from it; as may well have been the case with this young woman (in which case this "long COVID" she's suffering from is not from the virus itself, but from being put on a ventilator unnecessarily).</p>

        <p>Well I’m glad that we are changing course on this! I personally have been reading more articles about successful treatments and pathology of the virus Itself, rather than reading what’s not working so I didn’t really know about this. I’m sure this woman is suffering from long term effects of being on the vent (depends on how long she was on the vent as well). But COVID-19 May be playing a role too. I have said this to many of my friends and colleagues (in and outside the field of medicine) that it will be fascinating to read about COVID-19 research over the next few years. We will continue to learn about it and better our patient care and care for our community</p>

        <p>Trust me they were using CPAP and BiPAP before now. You don’t just intubate someone for shits and giggles. </p>
<p>Sure. Hospitals get paid more for ventilator usage as it needs more 1 on 1 nursing and constant monitoring, etc. but saying that the hospital administration is going down to the ER, ICU, or general floor and telling doctors that they need more money and to intubate someone is just asinine to believe</p>

        <p>Personally, I don't take these unverified stories seriously.   I am sure that some young people have gotten really sick, but they are outliers.  Just like some people get really sick with the flu or mono or any type of infection.   But, there are tons of people who lie about various things on the  Internet for attention or other reasons.   In fact, someone in r/coronavirus was telling people to lie about relatives dying to friends and coworkers so that they "would take the virus seriously."</p>

        <p>Exactly, it's funny how those on "the other side" are so quick to point out that people who disagree with the "science" are lying yet fail to see/acknowledge that it works both ways and people are just as likely to exaggerate their symptoms, most likely from the fear mongering of social media, or like you suggested, lying to get some clicks.</p>

        <p>I had mono as a teenager and I barely remember it in the beginning. 
Apparently my mom came downstairs because I wasn't getting ready for school and I just looked like death.</p>
<p>Two friends had been out of school for around a month with it. No idea how long I wasn't in school, no idea how long I was sick.. I just remember being not normal for months afterward.. so long so we thought I was the outlier with permanent damage and just had to "keep waiting and see what happens."</p>
<p>It was one of the worst illnesses I've ever had.</p>

        <p>Yo same. I’m 28 now and had it when I was 16. I have repeatedly had doctors tell me I’m still experiencing the lingering effects of mono (last of which occurred when I was 24). I’ve also had covid and tested positive on March 24th and suspect I’ve had some lingering fatigue. It fucking HAPPENS it’s just part of life.</p>

        <p>I’m trying to get back on the weight loss wagon, and I don’t know this woman, but it sounds like she’s not eating right. I’ve dropped two pounds in the last two weeks and I feel like I was stuck for so long because I didn’t measure portions correctly and/or snacked too much on crap. I’m trying to relearn all of that now. Ever heard the phrase “You can’t outrun a bad diet”? </p>
<p>Also would be curious if she does any other workouts or if she just takes “steps” and considers that good enough.</p>

<p>Conversely, you want to put millions and millions at risk of poverty and mental health problems for a virus with a 99.9 percent survival rate.   </p>

        <p>I want to make an income, not hit the bottle every night out of depression and mental fatigue, be able to go to my doctor appointments without being asked if I want a Covid test when I'm coming for an ear infection, to take my kids to museums and on field trips and to the zoo and the playground with peers, to vote without being intimidated by mask enforcers, be allowed to see my family without any of us risking losing our jobs for crossing state borders, visit my family without looking up the lockdown restrictions in the states we have to travel through to get there, not rely on government benefits to pay the bills due to hysteria and a closing economy, not be harassed in public for not being afraid of a virus, not have to sit in a van with my sobbing children as our cat is put to sleep in the veterinarian office without his family there..</p>
<p>That's just me.. one person. There's many more of me than there are who are dead from a fucking cold.</p>
<p>I don't even care anymore, no. I do fucking not care if you are at risk. Stay home. Let us keep the economy going for ourselves and for you. If you're so at risk you can't come into the community safely because of a bad cold going around then you need us to keep working so that you can continue getting state benefits to live off of (and I'm absolutely not shaming those genuinely unable to work ! You need others to work though, period !). </p>
<p>Why do you want to force everyone else to stay home too ? Are you jealous, selfish, what ? If you're so at risk if you contract this virus that you genuinely will probably die then you are knocking on deaths door anyway ...and if you are not you're an outlier and it fucking happens. It could be me, it could be your neighbor...but so could any random ass virus we come into contact with every day.</p>
<p>Any illness, car ride, swim, hike, or doctor appointment could be your last. Even now, as we all are supposed to sit inside and chatter our teeth over COVID we are wasting precious days we already have so few of, putting our children's children onto terrible debt to pay for it... Over what ? Why ? It is ruining lives.</p>
<p>Death is normal. This shit is not.</p>
