    <strong>Know any healthcare types who are reporting overflowing hospitals?</strong>
    <p><p>My relatives are. Cousin says "they're rolling out dead people every day". I didn't care to investigate the comment any further because I'm sure I've already alienated the rest of my family by not buying the hype.</p>
<p>Back in April, I wondered "If there wasn't a 24/7 propagandistic media blitz surrounding coofid, would our doctors and nurses even comment to anyone on how busy they are?"</p>
<p>It's possible that here in SoCal, the health bureaucrats are playing fatal tricks to pad the ICU pop numbers or even going back to the March classic, "Shove vents down people who don't need it."</p></p>

        <p>If they were seriously worried about reaching hospital capacity they would be actively building field hospitals. Most of the ones they put up in March have since been dismantled.</p>

        <p>Healthcare workers have literally been laid off or given substantially less hours in some places. The military is fully equipped and fully staffed, if hospitals were truly "overrun" the national guard medical units would respond first followed by federal medical units.</p>

        <p>Great job exposing your laughable disdain for the most successful economic model ever utilized by mankind while also not even remotely providing a worthwhile response. The lack of utilization of the military medical units has pretty much nothing to do with private healthcare or capitalism.</p>

        <p>&rt;Great job exposing</p>
<p>As if I was hiding it. Profit and optimal health care provision are not the same and often counter, the best interests of the patient and the company are not the same. Treating the frail and the comorbid are not lucrative, particularly if elective surgery and the big cash cows are reduced - layoffs can and will also reflect the need to save money.</p>
<p>&rt;The lack of utilization of the military medical units</p>
<p>Which I wasnt addressing. You discussed lay offs, to which I was replying. If you want a reply, it could be because they simply arent fucking competent, treating T1RF in 80 year old doris is not exactly their forte. It also wouldnt surprise me if it was simply a publicity stunt by politicians pretending to give a shit. Shit tier army, shit tier army medics.</p>

        <p>You weren't hiding that your disdain for capitalism is laughable, correct.</p>
<p>The hospitals are collecting additional money from at least Medicaid &amp; Medicare for Covid-19 patients, they are quite literally capitalizing on treating diagnosed patients. The "frail and comorbid" you are referring to are make up the vast majority of individuals who use those government programs.</p>
<p>Military Doctors not only go to the same medical schools as anyone and everyone else (this includes studying and even focusing on epidemiology &amp; infectious diseases), but are also trained additionally by the military. The military does the same exact thing for PA's, Nurses &amp; Combat Medics, they are all trained by both civilians and the military beyond the standards which are typically found in the private sector. The "Army Medics" you are referring to are essentially EMTs and paramedics, and are pretty much the least trained medical professionals in the military yet can still provide nursing &amp; other related duties, as needed.</p>

<p>You are right, they do! And then specialise. But there is not exactly a huge amount of resp,Gerrys and renal care in the army. It is not their service demand. It is not offensive to say that they specialise and it not offensive to say that the average army doc has very little experience of, for example, NIV or acute Hd</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, that's quite accurate, but under the current circumstances I would argue that it at the very least parallels the payments seen from private insurers.</p>
<p>The military literally has respiratory units, I don't think it's a stretch to say they could provide oversight to other medical units who were treating Covid-19 patients. If there were any actual real emergency those units would have been deployed to treat the alleged overflow of Covid-19 patients or potentially other patients which have been turned away.</p>
