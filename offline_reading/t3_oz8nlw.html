    <strong>COVID Day 5</strong>
    <p><p>Time for my update.  </p>
<p>Honestly I'm not sure if it's the Ivermectum or the Vid that's got me groggy this morning.  Found out that I can take the meds all at once or through the day so last night I dropped two of the 4 I'm supposed to take right before bed and slept deep and long.  </p>
<p>Throat is still a little sore but the dry cough has seemed to take a hike.  Still not the worst sick I've ever felt though.</p></p>

        <p>Under dosing is not advisable.. Follow protocols for active infection rather than prophylaxis and base it on exact weight .</p>

        <p>Oh I wasn't clear. I took all 4.  I just didn't like the effect and figured it might be better to take all 4 at once before bed time instead of feeling like shit all day :)</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm laughing my ass off ‚Äî you got Covid‚Ä¶ but you said you‚Äôre from another planet? üòÇ</p>
<p>&rt; believe or know?  I know I'm from another planet but I can't convince anyone of that :)</p>
<p>Your comment history is full of bullshit. Including threatening me with violence because you couldn‚Äôt defend your own beliefs:</p>
<p>&rt;Well first of all my skull is just fine.  Second of all you haven't made a single intelligent argument just like the rest of you children that wander in here and try to stir up drama.  Sooooo... let me put it on your level.  Your the opinion and the opinion of people like you means fuck all to me.  Let me make this clear.  I do not give a fuck about what you think.  I don't care if you die.  I don't care about your grandma.  So go live your life because if you try to intrude on mine it will not end well for you unless you're a masochist and I hope you're a masochist and one of you children come at me in person like you come at me online because I could use some stress relief.  Beating someone like you into the fetal position crying like the little bitch would make me smile.  And I want to smile AH.  I REALLY want to smile.  But you've bored me so.. goodbye</p>
<p>This is another comment by you that apparently <em>you</em> deleted:</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://imgur.com/a/Q57QFJ8">link</a></p>
<p>Take a moment to appreciate how conspiratorial and absolutely moronic that comment is, please. </p>
<p>You‚Äôre the most brainwashed, braindead &amp; delusional person that has ever threatened me online, and I <em>actively and maliciously</em> troll patriot-front &amp; 3%ers white supremacist forums. I am very comfortable with threats of violence and familiar with delusion. You don‚Äôt scare me. I absolutely pity you, and your vacuous mind. </p>
<p>According to your own comments you‚Äôre 57 y/o 
and 130lbs? Who <em>the fuck</em> do you think is threatened by you? Literal children? Infants? <em>What a painfully awkward joke.</em> You don‚Äôt scare anyone. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope you recover from Covid so you can work on eventually reading a whole Harry Potter book without paid tutoring. Maybe you can become a contributing member of society instead of a literal cancer. Otherwise, I guess you fucked around and found out eh?</p>
<p>I am looking forward to your painfully desperate &amp; equally pathetic reply. Please stop threatening violence though‚Ä¶ that is even less convincing than claiming you‚Äôre an alien and the ‚Äúmeesos‚Äù exist, per your own previously shit-tier comments. </p>
<p>The extraterrestrial claims are even less convincing than your Covid claims. You are a decrepit, delusional, weakling and you should accept that reality. Just check yourself into an assisted living situation and leave the thinking to those with functional brains.</p>
