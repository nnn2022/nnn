        <p>We did virtually eliminate smallpox. It didn't disappear though and it actually took centuries to eradicate, we'd crush up smallpox scabs and infect people with mild cases of it to inoculate against it before developing a modern day vaccine. According to Wikipedia (though not directly referenced) the inoculation technique had 0.5% to 2% mortality rate, compared to the 30% mortality rate of a full infection. It was eventually banned in favour of vaccines in many countries that finally eradicated it but centuries of inoculation was likely a big factor in it's eradication.</p>
<p>The idea that we could rapidly develop and deploy a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 seems a little far-fetched to me. You always have to balance between speed, cost and quality with any undertaking after all. But even if we were to manage such a task as creating a safe and effective vaccine a virus will take a considerable time to eradicate.   Logistically getting everyone vaccinated alone would be a nightmare.  </p>
<p>Viruses also can either lie dormant, spread quietly, or transmit across species. In some species viruses that are deadly to others are completely benign. We have an example of this in the UK with our old native squirrels actually; native to the British Isles are smaller red squirrels (I think they are similar to certain European squirrels), unfortunately they're susceptible to a nasty disease that the grey American squirrels that now dominate England are unaffected by but carriers of.</p>

        <p>&rt; but centuries of inoculation was likely a big factor in it's eradication. </p>
<p>sadly this is not how it went with smallpox, despite the story of the miracles vaccines being told over and over again...</p>
<p>so what is the real story?</p>
<p>the real story is, that people lived in unbelievable unimaginable conditions.</p>
<p>they had contaminated drinking water with shit in the  almost uninhabitable cities of the time.</p>
<p>no sewage systems. people starving and malnourished, horrible hygiene, etc...</p>
<p>again simply put people lived in shit pretty much. this caused much death and disease.</p>
<p>to show an example graph we can look at scarlet fever's mortality rate:</p>
<p><strong>England and Wales scarlet fever mortality rate from 1838 to 1978.</strong><br>
<a href="http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G11.1-UK-Scarlet-1838-1978.png">http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G11.1-UK-Scarlet-1838-1978.png</a> </p>
<p>there is no scarlet fever vaccine. what changed was the living conditions.</p>
<p>basic hygiene, SEWAGE SYSTEMS, CLEAN DRINKING WATER, enough and better food, etc...</p>
<p>could the same be the case for smallpox? could it be, that living condition changes fixed the smallpox problem?</p>
<p>well to figure that out we can look at how effective the smallpox vaccine was:</p>
<p><strong>Leicester, England, smallpox mortality rate vs. smallpox vaccination coverage from 1838 to 1910:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G7.1-Leicester-Smallpox-Cov-1838-1910.png">http://www.dissolvingillusions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/G7.1-Leicester-Smallpox-Cov-1838-1910.png</a> </p>
<p>at 100% vaccination rate with some even taking extra doses the biggest smallpox outbreaks happened.</p>
<p>the people saw, that this HORRIBLE HORRIBLE deadly vaccine provided 0 protection,  yet caused death and disease. what happened as a result was that the smallpox vaccine alone created the medical freedom movement against mandatory smallpox vaccines of the time, because the parents weren't willing anymore to sacrifice their children for a poison injection, that provided 0 benefit.</p>
<p>now remember, that this happened before there was internet, so that came about from people talking to each other in leicester england and other places. imagine how bad and useless an injection has to be to cause such massive resistance and push for freedom and against the mandates of the time.</p>
<p>i could go further into detail and go over acip meetings, that discussed, that a wide modern smallpox vaccination campaign would shatter the trust into vaccination as a whole, because of the massive side effects number and deaths or other stuff.</p>
<p>BUT read my badly written comment, when you can watch a 1 hour presentation full of references, that you can and should look up yourself about what is really going on with smallpox:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oot0HUqMcs&amp;t=758s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oot0HUqMcs&amp;t=758s</a> </p>
<p>the reality of the matter is, that you can go and thank your toilet, sewage system, clean food and CLEAN DRINKING WATER for making sure, that we are healthy and don't die from smallpox, NOT a vaccine.</p>
<p>understanding the history of vaccination is critical to understand what is going on rightnow, because history is repeating itself as the same criminals are trying to force inject us already again with other vaccines and soon the "covid-19" completely untested vaccines.</p>
<p>people's trust in vaccines generally comes from the myths of history. the myth, that vaccines saved us from smallpox and polio, but when you look at ANY of them you see, that it smells like shit and propaganda.</p>
<p>hell to just give a short example of the polio scam, they changed the definition of polio when the vaccines came out to fake, that the vaccines worked at all.</p>
<p>neurotoxins were put onto and into children back then in the form of lead arsenate and DDT.</p>
<p>now if we use the old definition of polio, which was basically some paralysis and look at the bill gates polio vaccination program in india, then guess what:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf</a> </p>
<p>NPAFP =  non-polio acute flaccid paralysis = fits old definition of polio</p>
<p>&rt; A total of 640,000 children developed NPAFP in the years 2000–2017, suggesting that there were an additional 491,000 paralyzed children above our expected numbers for children with NPAFP. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; The response to the reduction in OPV rounds (de-challenging) adds credence to the assumption that OPV was responsible for the change in the NPAFP rate. </p>
<p>this means, that bill gates mass vaccination program supposedly against polio in india caused 490000 cases of polio! if you go with the old definition of it.</p>
<p>but thank goodness the definition got changed and i am sure those 490000 paralyzed children will be happy to hear that too.</p>
<p>and remember, that the same people behind the indian mass paralysis/ old definition polio causing vaccination program are now pushing the covid-19 vaccines. bill gates being one of the big ones in the center of course.</p>
<p>and the scam of faking a vaccine being effective is even easier, when you have never isolated anything and don't have real tests at all like is the case for "covid-19".</p>
<p>they can just stop testing and claim, that the vaccines saved everyone. or they can lower doubling rates of the pcr method used from 40 to 3 or whatever, that will result in 0 positive results and it will also look like the vaccine saved people.</p>
<p>history repeats itself and the only thing, that history shows us, that vaccines continuously are good at eradicating is human health and human life sadly. :/</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to share this information. The medical industrial complex has done a thorough job of whitewashing most of this info and brainwashing the majority of society into believe their vaccines have eradicated these diseases. </p>
<p>In fact, Harvard Professor Dr. Kass gave a lecture to the Infectious Diseases Society of America in 1970 (which he was president of at the time), where he stated that “This decline in rates of certain disorders, correlated roughly with socioeconomic circumstances, is merely the most important happening in the history of the health of man, yet we have only the vaguest and most general notions about how it happened and by what mechanisms socioeconomic improvement and decreased rates of certain diseases run in parallel.”</p>
<p>Then in 1977 we were warned in <a href="http://vaccinesafetycommission.org/pdfs/McKinlay%201977.pdf">this study</a> that even though vaccines were introduced well after these diseases were on the way out, that vaccine companies would try to take credit for their eradication and use that narrative to serve their own private interests.</p>
<p><a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/106/6/1307">This study also</a> reiterates that sanitation and socioeconomic factors had more to do with the eradication of these disease than vaccines.</p>

        <p>Speaking as an Amazon worker, I'd really love to see the explosion from that. Seriously, "essential" workers are invisible. We get a food party (maybe!), a dress-up day, and constant cliche "we appreciate you" messages. Hazard pay? Unlimited time off? Paid time off? What's that?</p>
<p>If this virus is so deadly, why hasn't every essential worker dropped dead, especially when (at my job) we're now doing overtime? Can't have Thanksgiving dinner, but can pack no less than a thousand employees in a warehouse and have them work around machinery while exhausted. Yeah, that's safe.</p>
<p>I would revel in seeing the temper tantrums because Amazon shopping is closed for just one day.</p>
<p>(Amazon has PTO, but it maxes out at 48 hours and stops accumulating in June. And unless the state has a law about it, it doesn't roll over into next year.)</p>
