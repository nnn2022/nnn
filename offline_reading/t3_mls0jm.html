    <strong>I don’t want to get the vaccine, but I also don’t want to ruin my honeymoon.</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m in a position where I’ll be getting married in September (already had to move it back a year because all our guests were scared of covid). I don’t want to get the vaccine but I have an opportunity to and my only worry about not getting it is screwing my fiancé and I out of a honeymoon that we deserve.</p>
<p>I’ve been hearing that vaccine passports will be a thing so I’m worried that if I stand my ground and don’t get the vaccine I’m going to ruin any opportunity of us going anywhere out of country. </p>
<p>As much as I think this whole COVID and the vaccine stuff is total bullshit, I’m not willing to cause a fight or even screw myself out of something I’ve personally been looking forward to doing after dealing with this clown world for the past year. I don’t trust the vaccine at all, but I feel like I’m out of options here. Honeymooning inside the US is not an option because personally I just find that lame and not adventurous in the slightest. </p>
<p>Just wanted to post and talk about it in a place where I won’t get slammed. My entire family has been slamming me over not getting the vaccine and my fiancé wants me to as well but understands and is okay with my reasoning for not getting it up to this point. Anyone else in a similar situation with traveling out of country in the next couple months?</p></p>

        <p>I don’t mean this facetiously, but is the honeymoon worth potentially jeopardizing your long term health should unknown side effects arise down the road?  If the vaccine later causes fertility problems for you and / or your spouse, will you regret getting the vaccine so you could go abroad? Personally, I’m willing to make sacrifices and forego any and all travel,  vacations, and recreational activities that will require vaccination.</p>

        <p>I was in a similar position with an entire extended family cruise that was moved to later this year (assuming it's running). I got a Pfizer vaccine and it's been good to go. The cruises said they'd only allow vaccinated adults on, so it is what it is. I got vaccinated for the same reason I did diversity training at work: I don't think I need it, but people leave me alone more and it's not the hill I want to fight for.</p>
<p>It was a risk, but getting Covid is a risk, too. At some point you just have to pucker your poop chute and pick your path. I don't think vaccinations are required or the only correct choice, but it made life simpler and I didn't die from it (yet).</p>
<p>I'm not a doctor, I don't care much about Covid, and I have a high tolerance for risk. None of this is advice you should follow.</p>

        <p>There's a very good chance these vaxxes affect your ability to have children. If that's not important to you, they may also cause a lot of bad health in the future. I'm so sorry your family are all pressuring you! But this is your entire future that could be affected by one decision. Please think carefully before you cave in. </p>
<p>Maybe you could plan to go on your first honeymoon somewhere within the US, and plan a second international honeymoon for later? "Lame and not adventurous"... do you know how huge this country is, and what all there is to see and do here? Before you rule it out, at least spend a couple evenings researching "best vacation spots in US" or something. I don't know what you and the fiance like to do but there's everything from hang-gliding to cave exploration to beach resorts to about anything you can imagine doing on this huge part of the world.</p>

<li>Can you find a place that doesn't have it? </li>
<li>You'll probably have to wear a mask the whole trip, this doesn't sound fun.</li>
<li>Can you elope for now and worry about the honeymoon later? 
I've never been married, so I don't know how important these things are. If I do get married it would probably be at the courthouse because I can't imagine who I'd invite so please don't take offense to my comment.</li>
