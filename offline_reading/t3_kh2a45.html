    <strong>We are being tested for our own DNA</strong>
    <p><p>The PCR "test" is not based on viral RNA. For example, if we look at the WHO protocol ( <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/</a>... ) and pay attention to the second primer (CTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT) and then go to the so-called Gene Bank, to the page where the 8th chromosome is described ( <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/NC_000008.11?.">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/NC_000008.11?.</a>.. ), at the very bottom we see the exact same sequence. That means we are being tested for our own DNA.</p>
<p>The WHO protocol is not used everywhere, the primers differ from country to country, but this does not change anything since the origin of other sequences is not known, there are no scientific publications whose authors approach the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in a scientific way. Yes, Peng Zhou, Na Zhu, Jeong-Min Kim, McMaster University claim to have isolated the virus, but if you look at the "isolation" process, it is clear that purification and isolation are out of the question: they either don't filter the pulmonary fluid, or, having filtered it, they mix in Vero cells, liquid fetal calf serum, and antibiotics, in response to which the cells secrete extracellular vesicles. Dr. Andrew Kaufman has analyzed various German PCR testing protocols, and many of the primers mentioned there had an 80%-85% similarity in the genetic sequence to certain parts of the human genome. The number of cycles + the amount of genetic material in the sample will play a big role in determining whether you are "sick" or not.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, but why would they need so much of a peasant DNA when they simply want 6B people gone?</p>

        <p>They're not using vaccines to kill us, they're using them to sterilize us and as we see with the UK, they're using them to make the virus spread more.</p>

        <p>They don't need DNA. They need to make sure there are many cases of "corona" (the test finds your own DNA and that gets passed over for "covid"). Some people, having tested positive and unlucky enough to also have severe symptoms of a respiratory disease (flu, AVI, bronchitis, tonsilitis, pneumonia etc), are outright killed by lethal medication "which helps to fight covid". Like hormonal steroids, highly toxic antimalarial drugs, combinations of antibiotics, highly tovix HIV medication etc. Unless the doctor understands that the protocols for treating covid are BS and prescribes the regular anti-pneumonia medication. It's like a Russian roulette. And it's basically genocide. Why do they need many covid cases? To cover up a massive crisis of overproduction, Great Depression 2.0, with a "deadly virus". Under the pretext of the global "pandemic" the following goals are achieved by global monopolies, largest capital:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>closing down plants, factories and even whole industries (i.e. slowing down the production process in order to let old products gradually dissolve and stop the production of new ones; dealing with not only oversupply of products, resulting from incorrect distribution, but also services)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>downsizing workforce (because many workers are simply not needed when there is an overproduction of goods)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>killing off small and medium businesses in order to replace them on the market (this always happens during an economic crisis, a small capitalist gets eaten by a big one; for example, the so-called "swine flu" helps to effectively bankrupt smaller businesses, magically avoiding huge corporations https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever-farmers-idUSKCN1PQ47J p.s. no, China is not a socialist country)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cutting expenses on healthcare and education (millions of operations have been cancelled, medical staff has been getting laid off; schools and universities are switching to remote learning with plans to replace teachers with video lectures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fighting and slowing down the inevitable revolutionary uprise (protests and strikes resulting from downsizing, loss of small and medium businesses, loss of democratic rights etc) by banning social gatherings, putting muzzles on people's faces and demoralizing them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intensifying economic exploitation (cancelling bonuses and freezing salaries; making people work overtime under the pretext of "difficult times for us all"; not paying wages for several months etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maximizing profits, making billions of dollars out of thin air by forcing millions of people to buy a product they don't need (surgical masks against a respiratory virus, sanitizers, gloves, electronic thermometers etc. The daily profit from masks alone is so gigantic that they are for sure to remain with us forever now, until people abolish them)</p>
</li>
</ul>
