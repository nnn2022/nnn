    <strong>Normal in July</strong>
    <p><p>Anybody see that tik tok where a girl is asking a retired ‚Äúspecial agent‚Äù (I know, I took it with a grain of salt) when we will go back to normal and quickly says July? Now that more places are lifting masks, new movies are now only being shown in theatres instead of HBO max and sporting events,restaurants,concerts and other shit are going back to 100% capacity. I‚Äôm starting to think maybe he was legit üòÇ</p>
<p>Sorry I left out a pretty important detail. I saw this tik tok around Christmas time.</p></p>

        <p>Enjoy it while it lasts. And I sincerely hope that it does. Support local businesses more as things continue to open up to full capacity. Cyber Polygon simulation starts July 9th. Considering WEF's 2019 simulation was in October, I'd say the real thing will start a few months later, so maybe fall or even winter. Shit's already hitting the fan worldwide regarding agriculture and feed supplies, so it may be slow rather than all at once like with covid.</p>

&rt;America is finally winning its fight against the coronavirus For the first time in a long time, nobody needs to cherry-pick some misleading data to make it seem like things are going well, and the good news doesn‚Äôt need an endless list of caveats, either. It‚Äôs just really good news. We‚Äôre winning. Be happy.</p>

&rt;How the Covid pandemic ends: Scientists look to the past to see the future</p>
<p>Even over in Europe, and other Western "Democracies" the sudden harsh lockdowns from a month ago are suddenly peeling off.</p>
<p>The "End" is near.</p>
<p>Sure, The "End" also means they will hang a "New Variant Threat" over our heads, and spring one in time for the next US elections...</p>
<p>But that doesn't stop the "Victory Over Covid" narrative. It's kind of the entire point - to claim Democrats and Joe Biden gave us victory. Much like the lockdowns, the actual science won't matter. Just the narrative. And the rest of the world will follow suit pretty fast.</p>
<p>Afterall, there are a lot of members of the <a href="https://i.redd.it/2gtzvnevwzz61.jpg">"Build Back Better" global cabal</a>. The Deep State isn't just for Americans anymore. And they are all on the same page in the Plandemic.</p>
