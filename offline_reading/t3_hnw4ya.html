<p>Masks are totally psychological. I can't say I'm personally decided on the ultimate end-game for that, but they're certainly not about health. That's easily evidenced by the countless people wearing them wrong, touching their faces, etc etc. Or wearing them outside in the stifling heat.</p>
<p>What makes me lol is seeing obviously overweight and unhealthy people wearing them. Like, bitch, your first concern should be avoiding type-2 diabetes and heart disease, not getting the sniffles.</p>

<p>My personal favorite is the guy who pulls down his mask to drink malt liquor,  smokes a cigarette or eats a cheese burger,  sometimes all at once.</p>

        <p>Yeah there’s a family member of mine who has been so over the top. He’s 50 years old, a smoker, and to top it all off, at least 300 pounds. In a way I can understand his fear since he would definitely be in bad shape (no pun intended) if he got the virus.</p>
<p>With that being said, has this been a wake up call for him to improve his health? Not at all. It’s a shame, and I’m sure there are many others that are the same way.</p>

        <p>Seriously? Yeah...I'm aware of how diabetes and viruses work. Do you know how analogies and comparisons work? Just because diabetes isn't contagious doesn't mean it's not a major health issue. It doesn't mean we don't have an epidemic of obesity in America.</p>
<p>My point still stands. If you really give a shit about your health, ditch the mask, eat some broccoli and hit the gym.</p>

        <p>Dude, seriously? I'm not referring to you specifically. It's the royal you. All those "yous" out there who are overweight, unhealthy and at high risk for diabetes, heart disease or chronic respiratory distress. In America alone there are literally <em>millions</em> of them.</p>
<p>I'm highlighting the point that all those "yous" out there would much rather just put a mask on and think they're doing a good thing for their health when at best, it does little to nothing. But hey, it makes them feel better, and most importantly, it's <em>easy.</em> Why actually increase their health, lifespan and immunity when they can just put a dirty t-shirt over their face and call it a day?</p>

        <p>It's a "good thing" to wear a mask in the same way that it's a "good thing" to never drive a car so you don't get into an accident. It's a "good thing" to chop off your breasts so you never get breast cancer.</p>
<p>Being alive has risks. People still drive. People still keep their breasts. But hey, if you want to wear a mask to <em>maybe</em> avoid a disease with a 0.2%-0.6% fatality rate, go nuts. But don't expect or demand that others join in. Some of us like to drive. Some of us like our boobs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-2">I'm looking at the CDC site</a>, and the mean number of days from the onset of symptoms (not hospitalization) to death is about 15 days. The mean number of days from symptom onset to hospitalization is 7 days. The mean number of days in hospitalization, if ICU admitted, is about 10 days and, without ICU admission, it is about half of that at 5 days.</p>
<p>Edit, 7 days later: Damn... He deleted his account. In a comment to this, he was saying it would take an average 20 days for the deaths to show up. I wanted to point out that 21 days ago was June 26 and we had over 47,000 new cases that day. The most ever up to that point and there has been no significant or proportional increase in deaths.</p>

        <p>Numbers have gone down from 19 to 10. That is new information to me, thank you for providing it</p>
<p>Edit: The std deviation of 7 days is insanely wide though.</p>
<p>Edit2: Mean number of days from death to reporting of 7.2 with a std deviation of 7.7 is highly concerning.</p>
<p>From the beginning lets do it, and we're going to use the smallest number among the 3 ages groups provided for each calculation to err on your side of caution. 6.2 days from symptoms to hospitalization, 9.5 days hospitalization, 12.9 days from symptom onset to death, 6.6 days from death to reporting that death. So people are getting included in the death statistics on average 19.5 after showing symptoms and 16.1 days after hospitalization.</p>
<p>Your own source says death count is lagging a week behind actual death, let alone detection. But you're right. 60k cases today doesn't mean more deaths in the future</p>

<p>Two people I know were talking about them today...</p>
<p>person a was distressed as they were the only one <em>on a bus</em> not wearing a mask. This person did not disinfect the seats, or change their clothes before and/or after they got on it.</p>
<p>They were we commended by person b.</p>
<p>I respect their right to do this. But the sicophantic / virtue signalling my friends displayed today made my blood curdle. I was speechless.
imo, they should either be relaxed or commit to the fear - do not just conform and then sneer at others who look into things and decide to be careful in other ways (such as getting a cab, which arguably is safer as you expose yourself to only one other person).</p>

        <p>I would love to see you actually respond to guy's points. Let's not lie to ourselves and call it a once in a century pandemic. If the death rate was something like 10% then that would be scary and I would probably be more concerned. As I discovered by listening to the relevant Tony Robbins podcast, one of the experts point out that for under 70s, the death rate is less than a tenth of a percent. Nothing different here to a flu.</p>

        <p>I know you guys are stuck in this little echo chamber patting each other on the back for not wearing masks and convincing each other this pandemic is some sort of minor cold or even some strange global conspiracy.  One thing you guys are missing is this virus isn't just you live or you die.  It can disable you.  It can make being alive no fun, potentially for the <em>rest of your life</em>.  Here's <strong>70</strong> papers on the effectiveness of masks in preventing spreading this stupid virus so economies can open back up/stay open and normalcy can return ASAP: </p>
<p>https://threader.app/thread/1279144399897866248 </p>
<p>Read some if you want or just keep being stubborn.  Masks are just this stupid, temporary thing that keeps your city from being locked down and your economy running but that only happens when most/all people wear them.</p>

        <p>So what protection would you suggest from being crushed in a car accident?</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide in your home?</p>
<p>Food poisoning?</p>

<p>Falling down a flight of stairs?</p>
<p>Cancer?  Diabetes?  </p>
<p>Being beaten by a mob of complete strangers by being in the wrong place at the wrong time?</p>
<p>The fact is, CV is the latest in a list of things that CAN happen to you, and has varying degrees of ending badly for you.</p>
<p>You can wrap yourself in all the bubble wrap you want, but eventually you have to accept that virtually anything can disable, maim or kill you.</p>
<p>Once you've developed a tolerance for accepting the risk that comes with being alive, you're pretty much stuck with accepting that something out there, or even in your house, even on accident, completely on a fluke, might just kill you.</p>

        <p>I find this to be partially true. We won’t live forever and we can’t spend our whole life worrying about what might hurt us or even kill us. But I do buy cars with good safety ratings and air bags, I drive defensively and do my absolute best not to have a car accident, I use carbon monoxide alarms in my house, wash my skin when there is an open wound. I try to eat healthy foods and exercise, to avoid many known carcinogens such as those in cigarettes.</p>

        <p>Not only are those all things we take precautions for, they’re practically all things that have <em>legally mandated</em> precautions.  Seatbelts, co2 detectors, health codes for restaurants, handrails, cancer warnings on products, etc.  almost like we regularly legislate things that are dangerous.</p>

<p>We literally have protections and regulations for most of the straw man arguments you are making. And you see people in Asian countries wear a mask any time they so much as have the sniffles from allergies they are so considerate of others in the community. Wearing a mask during an extremely contagious is such a small inconvenience you might as well be asking why you have to wear shoes.</p>

        <p>...because in the US (and the West in general) there has never been a culture of wearing masks before this. Just because I didn't in the past does not make a hypocrite. If I didn't wear one now and told others to, that would make me a hypocrite. Or if I don't wear one in the future. Going forward, after seeing and understanding the importance of wearing them, I think people in the West will wear masks more often when they feel unwell. Obviously not some people, like yourselves, because rather than try and be better it seems you would rather be purposely ignorant.</p>

        <p>And just because we have those things, it doesn't mean they will 100% prevent bad things from happening to you.  That is my point.  </p>
<p>You can't legislate away every possibility of every bad thing ever happening to you ever.  You can't build everything for 100% safety.  </p>
<p>Eventually, you have to take a risk and get dirty or do something that might cause you harm.</p>

        <p>But you still make an effort to reduce the chances of something bad happening. And it's not just about you, yourselves, but others in your community. Is doing something as simple and effortless as wearing a cloth mask is too difficult for you? Do you also think that wearing a seat belt or having safety inspections on cars is ridiculous?</p>

        <p>&rt;for not wearing masks</p>
<p>Where is your proof for us not wearing mask? How could we possibly not wear one of it's the law? I like how you tried to pin the blame on subs like this. I don't think it will when over well when the diabetic dying of covid results in charging mask deniers with manslaughter. This prediction is a little extreme, but its definitely getting close to that. Fortunately,  I'm 6 steps ahead of you and other propagandists. </p>
<p>&rt;convincing each other this pandemic is some sort of minor cold </p>
<p>No. The agencies including but not limited to the CDC said that most common immune response to Sarscov2 is zero to moderate symptoms,  as in the common cold. A fancy name like COVID-19, doesn't make me look at these symptoms any different. There are other sources that have attributed the common cold to coronavirus. </p>
<p>&rt;strange global conspiracy. </p>
<p>It's not strange. It's a typical global "conspiracy", AKA business as usual.  Did you know that conspiracy is defined by the number if actors involved. Every organizational relationship is public information. I have stated no theory. Everything that I post is an observation. To idiots like you who don't really read industry news especially in technology, label anything above your understanding as a conspiracy theory. Just like I was called a conspiracy theorist for talking about social media data harvesting in 2010. Yet in 2015, Zuckerberg was sitting in front of a camera explaining to the government about his actions. Hmmmmm. The CDC and the WHO have decades long history in medical foul play. I am a victim of medical harm as a direct result of their policies. But I guess I'm making it all up. </p>
<p>&rt;One thing you guys are missing is this virus isn't just you live or you die. It can disable you.</p>
<p>The fear narrative and marketing message was originally about SARS, which most people didnt get and actively  reporting on "long term" damage only results in permanent fear, of the unknown. </p>
<p>They know this.  Again, this marketing 101.If they know this is the result, then I can only assume their is an agenda behind it. If they were planning to shut down JUST to flatten the curve, then build confidence in the economy shortly after then distributing "long term damage" news is in conflict of this objective. You think we are conspiracy nuts because you have a lower IQ. </p>
<p>&rt;It can make being alive no fun</p>
<p>Be more specific as in "no fun". I heard more stories about people catching non-covid illnesses that resulted in permanent or hard- to- recover damage, it was also contagious,  and yet no mandates. </p>
<p>&rt;potentially for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Funny because I had covid and can run a 5 mile with ease while these diabetic fat fucks are stuffing fried chicken under their mask to hoping to get a good chew AND I smoked for over a decade. First thing, I am VERY VERY strict on my diet. Lay off the milk and cheese product, it will do wonders.  </p>
<p>&rt;Here's 70 papers on the effectiveness of masks in preventing spreading this stupid virus</p>
<p>Wow you made a leap from "long term damage" to "wear a mask". Yeah sure. NO MARKETING HERE. C'mon guy, this script doesn't work here. </p>
<p>&rt;so economies can open back up/stay open and normalcy can return ASAP: </p>
<p>Again. Mandates were about keeping the hospitals from being overwhelmed.  Seems like that objective went out of the window, now that the hospitals experienced a false alarm. So NOW the mandate is the get out jail free card. Hmm. I surely hope you dont think that the stimulus and unemployment check is going to help you at the end. You are in for a RUDE awaking. You are coping by blaming your shitty situation on "ThEy NoT WeAriNg MasKs!!!". Naw. We were wearing mask. For 4 months. You fucked up. Now own up to it. You need to go back to the agency who sent you, and cry to them.</p>

<p>this is false. there may be <em>some</em> data, collected under very specific conditions with strict controls on known infections but the when the totality of evidence is considered the conclusion is that there is simply not enough reliable data or relevant studies to support measures that arise in masking healthy, uninfected mass populations</p>

<p>alright, but to what end? I don't know if you know this but the virus isn't just magically going to disappear because people mask up and foolishly cower from one another in the store. you're going to catch this sooner or later, mask or not. so is everyone, you're just prolonging it needlessly at this point. your precious curve was flattened long ago. and you know what is great about all of that is you're still free to wear your mask and stay away from people, no problem bro! you just don't get to tell me what to do or what to wear</p>

        <p>If it can't be stopped then how have loads of countries that were massive hotspots now seeing counts under 200 a day? The problem is it isn't as effective unless everyone does it. But I guess you prefer whining on reddit with a bunch of other brainlets about sheep or something, because otherwise you'd wear a mask and actually be a beneficiary to society in stopping this. "Wah don't tell me what to do" is such a ridiculously childish mindset, I feel like I'm asking a 5 year old to eat their vegetables because it's good for them.</p>

        <p>Nothing other than herd immunity will stop it. Same as <em>every other virus in history</em>. You are demanding eternal enforcement of anti-pandemic measures as a foolish attempt at replacing that reality, just slowing it to the most painful crawl possible. As <em>soon</em> as you lift the restrictions you demand, the virus will spike all over again and you'll stamp your feet demanding the same things again. "If you just do these things we could be done in a month!" Ha. Wow.</p>
<p>Bro. It was already done for longer than a month... The curve was flattened. Resources are not being overwhelmed. What is your goal now? Do you <em>really</em> think you can <em>stop</em> it? You can't be that daft.</p>

        <p>You can't stop it, but you can reduce it to the point where it's no longer a factor. Nowhere did I demand eternal enforcement, I said if people could just do this for a month it would drop it to levels we now see in other countries that are returning to normal. Also in my state we've broken our single case record on 5 separate occasions in the past week and a half so that's not exactly a flattened curve. Also I still don't understand why wearing a mask is so drastic. You wear a shirt when you go outside don't you?</p>

<p>This ironically is a leftist politically biased talking point. It also could be that there is no way for proper enforcement outside of controlled environment such  as a hospital.

It's like airport security only choosing to check certain people as if the other people have no chance of being a threat.

<p>"May". For you guys to be so certain, you deal with A LOT of hypotheticals.  For one, lockdown and mask mandates was never designed to make coronavirus disappear.  It was intended to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed. By the agencies OWN words.  You seem to have a short memory with all this shifting of goal posts.

<p>I dont have time right now to argue all the points. But this one, I'm not arguing against. What I mean by arbitrary,  is that even under the seemingly strictist mandates,  people arent following them properly while having the mask ON.  The burden should be on the one giving the mandates in which they have been  strangely relaxed on. Overall, the goal of the mandates have been achieved. From this standpoint,  it looks more like a show than actual achievement. </p>

<p>What is hard to understand? The microscopic pathogens travel via respiratory droplets that are released from exhaling, talking, sneezing, etc. So yes, if you put something over your mouth and nose, it stops those droplets from spreading because they hit the mask instead of everyone near you.</p>

<p>Why should we have an entire population of people with permanent lung damage when all it takes is wearing a mask and staying home a little more than usual to prevent it?</p>

<p>*or face covering. The mandate isnt specific on what you cover your face with. So why are officials telling people they dont have to wear mask, and that any face covering would do, if masks work so well? </p>

<p>The coronavirus isnt new. Common colds have been attributed to them before. And we had 2 previous coronavirus outbreaks, MERS and one from china, in 2002. SARS was the only concerning secondary infection known to a coronavirus, maybe ARDS, but now all of a sudden spring of 2020, we exponentially dug up more secondary infections and long term damage in 3 months than in 16 years previously? Nah. That's a lie. CV was contained in 3 months in 2002. What makes this one so different? Not much,  only the intend to fabricate a pandemic by any means neccessary.  The goals posts weren't in response to psuedoscience, studies without peer review and deceptive news reporting, and if it were, it would be just as non ethical. </p>
<p>&rt;So it's no longer a valid strategy to just "let everyone eventually get it" - the goal is now to have as few people as possible get it until a vaccine is created so that in a year or so it'll be the same as polio - something that was very dangerous that no one has to worry about any more. </p>
<p>That was never the strategy.  That's a strawman arguement as well. </p>
<p>&rt;the goal is now to have as few people as possible get it until a vaccine</p>
<p>Yet, "few people" has never been defined. There was no speak of a CV vaccine in the last 2 outbreaks,  neither was there a shutdown. Why all of a sudden? And it will take years for a safe  vaccine (unless they had one from the start), and not everyone will take it, and it is likely to only be a little less than 40% effective. The "vaccine" is now being used as a "get out of jail free" card, after economic destruction being blamed on covid rather than the lockdown. Hmm but anybody suspicious of this is a "conspiracy theorist"? It sounds like a profiteering scam, to be honest, especially when you factor in the level of marketing and advertisements around the pandemic that have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with our health, with the news being about 90% of that. </p>
<p>&rt;Why should we have an entire population of people with permanent lung damage when all it takes is wearing a mask and staying home a little more than usual to prevent it?</p>
<p>Permanent lung damage is a result of ARDS, SARS and other secondary infections, maybe. I had covid. It's no big deal. Permanent lung damage is not the baseline for coronavirus infections. Now you are straight up lying.</p>

<p>Well asymptomatic people don't just go out and get tested for something, unless they were told there was a "pandemic " and "should get tested". </p>
<p>&rt;you dont</p>
<p>Probably because he is asymptomatic. You dont know now how likely he can infect others. The asymptomatic super spreader is unfounded. </p>
<p>&rt;And exactly there's data that shows wearing a mask slows the spread, </p>
<p>You completely retracted the conditions in which they are effective, the basis for his arguement, while also changing the objective goal post, which was originally to control infection in a specific setting, to another goalpost while also inserting this marketing message: "stop the spread". </p>
<p>&rt;glad you agree</p>
<p>He said nothing of the sort. Now you have resorted to lying. </p>
<p>&rt;Now wear a fucking mask. </p>
<p>Another marketing message. Or fed posting. </p>
<p>&rt;If everyone wore masks and socially distanced </p>
<p>Another marketing message and zero data to support this "if" statement </p>
<p>&rt;this whole thing would be done in a month</p>
<p>That's a pretty specific timeframe. Where did you come up with this number?</p>
<p>&rt;Isn't that what everyone wants?</p>
<p>If people wanted to go back to normal they would have. But we are being held hostage by mandates and allowing retards to dictate policy. Most of us HAVE went on with their lives. It's YOU that is maintaining the illusion of a pandemic because you want to believe in it so much.</p>

        <p>The asymptomatic spreader is a fickle claim. However, the PREsymptomatic super spreader is a real thing and you dumbasses don't know the difference.</p>

        <p>So if true and masks work so well then how can there be a "surge in cases". Masks have been mandated in pretty much every state and have been for months. This person claims it will take ONE month of mask wearing to resolve the issue. It's been 4 months of strict mask mandates and the data is still being misrepresented as a justification for extended or second lockdowns. </p>
<p>They both cant be true. Which one is it?</p>
<ol>
<li>Masks work </li>
<li>Masks dont work because the mucus and aerosol of PREsymptomatic super spreader penetrates right through them</li>

<p>Check out how Japan has quelled the virus. Also, a virus alone may penetrate cloth, but it travels on mucus droplets that do not.</p>

        <p>No it won't. That is the whole thing. Government leaders want to wait until a vaccination. The threat will always be there till that point. As on a global scale it won't disappear.</p>

        <p>I'm not arguing that point. I'm arguing the marketing messages, which most of you seem to be absolutely BLIND to even though there has been tens of millions of dollars of covid marketing and advertisements spent on communicating the same exact talking points. But you people thrive on your ridiculous conspiracy theory accusations,  as if advertising and marketing isnt brainwashing. What the fuck do you think MARKETING IS? Do you ACTUALLY think that you perceive the world based on instinct? </p>
<p>Do you think, they released all of these messages without first designing them for a purpose?  Are you out of your mind? COVID-19 is a product of Madison Avenue as much as it is a product of Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>&rt;in a pandemic </p>
<p>We aren't living in a pandemic any different than we were living in a tuberculosis pandemic. You are literally regurgitating the media marketing message. Pure garbage</p>
<p>&rt;scary</p>
<p>I'm not scared. You want us to be scared, this is why you are projecting an emotion to try to make me associate coronavirus, with pandemic, with this emotion. That's very marketing 101. I wouldn't be surprised if you are some type of government agent or hired by a PR firm to incite fear over the internet.  This is how  ad-packaged your response is.</p>

        <p>I don't think living in a pandemic is scary.</p>
<p>We don't think coronavirus is scary.</p>
<p>That is why people like you want us to wear masks. We are not the scared ones because I don't give a damn if it is a pandemic.</p>
<p>I want to party. Look how scared I am doing a group hug at my student association.</p>
<p>Yes that is totally why I don't want to wear a mask because I am scared of acknowledging a minor viral threat.</p>
<p>You are scared. I just want to be left alone by hysteria induced technocrats.</p>

        <p>Ah so you only want to pretend it's not a thing purely for selfish reasons because you miss partying, got it. Says a lot about you as a person. I'm not scared either, I wear a mask so I don't spread it to others in case I have it because it really doesn't impact me at all.</p>
