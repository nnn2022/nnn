    <strong>I would like to debate</strong>
    <p><p>Now before you go so quickly as to call me a sheep I value your opinion as much as I hope you could value mine</p>
<p>I am interested in a formal debate of sorts. I will come into this with an open mind and an opinion that can be changed.</p>
<p>I believe that we shouldn’t be arguing by throwing spite at each other but instead informing the opposition with facts and evidence</p>
<p>I am looking forward to your debates in the comments below</p></p>

        <p>You don't offer any proposition, so what are we meant to be debating? Although a minutes old account is likely not one made for the purpose of a good faith debate, I have to say.</p>

        <p>What would you like to debate? Here is what I could assume, and what I could debate, on a surface level: </p>
<p>Face masks: cool. By no means are face masks the end of the world. HOWEVER...it seems like masks are the hill we chose to die on. I think we can all agree that masks are not the be-all-and-end-all of protection for this “deadly” pandemic. It truly disgusts me when I see people freaking out, fighting, virtue signaling, and straight up dying over fucking masks. </p>
<p>I personally have been witness to two  severe mask fights (pro-masker antagonizing a person  w/ no mask on...not the other way around.) 
These were truly serious fights, and they made national news. Both of them. My daughter and I have nightmares about it. It’s ridiculous. </p>
<p>Lockdowns: Also ridiculous. We are causing so much pain! Isolation, desperation, evictions, loss of education, famine, poverty, overdoses, etc. it is absolutely unethical to lock people down in a perpetual state of fear with no end game. </p>
<p>“But only if we...”: newsflash, other countries are also going through what we are in the US. Yes, some countries handled the pandemic better then others. But it baffles me that people choose to sit home on their high horse and point fingers at “authorities” like Trump for failing us. Newsflash: it is extremely “privileged” to be able to stay home &amp; stay safe, “hunkered down”. 
We are here now. People are suffering. They have needs that far surpass covid. You cannot “hunker down” when you have to feed your family, go to your essential job, etc. 
Covid is far from the only thing poking at our survival instinct. </p>
<p>Trust the experts: Fauci? What about other experts? The Great Barrington Declaration is a common one. Why do we only choose to listen to the experts that confirm our beliefs? </p>
<p>I am a very open minded person. I look at a situation, and try to assess what is best. Coronavirus = bad. Perpetual Lockdowns = worse. People are suffering. We need to strike a balance. What about BLM protests make it ok for thousands of people to gather, but other protests are not ok? 
Why is it ok to purchase black boots, but not pink boots? Why <a href="https://thewestfieldnews.com/humason-says-stay-home-as-walmart-shuts-down-non-essential-aisles/">shut down </a> certain isles in the store? </p>
<p>Why close small businesses to funnel everyone into one big store? </p>
<p>Why do we shutdown schools, and then accuse parents who have to quit working to be with their kids as “treating schools as daycare centers”</p>
<p>Its all so nonsensical</p>
