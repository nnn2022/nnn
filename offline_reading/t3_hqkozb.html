    <strong>Fuck everyone for politicizing going back to schools</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a democrat but I’m seriously about to fucking switch. As soon as trump rightfully advocated for school reopenings everyone is like “we should keep them closed” and fuck teachers unions for not caring about kids</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely. I wish I had a good explanation for this. Ok, I will try...</p>
<p>Progressivism is borne of a feeling of external locus of control. In most societies in human history, this comes along with lacking any power to do anything with it. In our society, they have as much power as anyone else, thanks to universal suffrage.</p>
<p>This external locus of control makes them create things for others who have power to do things, because they feel they cannot do those things. They create laws for others to enforce, rather than solve the problem themselves in real life. Similarly, they feel everyone is equally helpless, so they create structures that are to support everyone. Think socialized services. Think replacing the family with services.</p>
<p>It's hard, or impossible, to argue with someone who feels that they don't have the power to make changes. You can't tell them that they don't need a right to do something, or that they have responsibility for something that they don't think they do. Psychologically, it's neigh impossible, and logically, unless you get at that core assumption, the rest of their arguments can be pretty sound.</p>
<p>Oh, and this ideology is backed by many government leaders and many megacorporations because it makes people easier to control and extract money/time/resources from.</p>
<p>It spreads because fear spreads. Fear can make you risk averse, which will nudge you to start hiding behind those bureaucratic institutions. </p>
<p>It also has a very deep root in academia and media, so spreading is rapid, and it's nearly impossible to get at the root cancerous nodes in our society. Those institutions are basically above the law, and the only way to engage them is on their turf. And if you still try? Expect to get your reputation destroyed, your job lost, potentially your marriage lost, potentially jailed.</p>

        <p>Okay, but likewise there is a balance to be had. Putting all public protections and agreements in the hands of individuals with no central organization is anarchy. Organization is an incredibly powerful tool for amplifying economic wellbeing, and arguably explains why there are no anarchic regions of consequence in the world. For society to function there is some degree of external control that occurs.</p>
<p>Regarding your thesis that progressivism is born entirely of external locus of control: people will gather to certain ideologies for numerous reasons, so frankly any summarizing of any group will be inadequate. I think compassion is also a large driver of progressivism, citing my own personal feelings and discussions with friends and peers. I live a comfortable life style, and I would be accepting of increased taxation and a reduction of financial power to help other members of my society. Both because it is a compassionate thing to do, but also because I see it as a long term investment towards my society. </p>
<p>Can you expand on your notion that progressivism spreads by fear? You mentioned it but seemed to take it as a given with no elaboration. Arguably there are also 'conservative' movements like All Lives Matter, which are motivated by fear that Black Lives Matter is a threat. Im not making any comment on their policy stances btw, I'm just focusing on the emotional responses.</p>
<p>You state that progressivism is deeply rooted in media,  but there still exists an abundance of conservative media. Conservatives still draw a tremendous amount of their information from media sources that are unapologetically against progressive policy.</p>
<p>I won't deny that academia has a large progressive population, however publications are uniquely capable of being precise and transparent. Academic sources are expected to cite their means of gathering information and provide analysis to explain  how their conclusion is drawn from their data. Even if you disagree with the conclusion of an academic paper,  it is much easier to identify where the disagreement comes from (bad method of collecting data or believing there are other more complete explanations for the data). It is for that reason that defying academia without dedicating a similar amount of rigor to one's claims is seen as foolish. </p>
<p>Generally,  with exception of jail time, all of those repercussions are perfectly valid in a system of free expression. Anyone is free to state their conclusions and reasoning, and likewise everyone is allowed to respond to those conclusions. Whether that is criticism or consensus.</p>

        <p>&rt;Putting all public protections and agreements in the hands of individuals with no central organization is anarchy.</p>
<p>You lost me with this phrase. Public protections and agreements?</p>
<p>&rt;Organization is an incredibly powerful tool for amplifying economic  wellbeing, and arguably explains why there are no anarchic regions of  consequence in the world.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>&rt;For society to function there is some degree  of external control that occurs.</p>
<p>You do not understand locus of control. The point is not whether other people have power (over you, or just in general). The point is whether you feel that you have power or not. A couple fallacies to point out here that  I believe you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>power is not a zero sum game, just like economics is not a zero sum game (power is merely a more abstract concept of economics)</li>
<li>the actions you take will affect how much power other people actually do have over you. if you have an option to achieve self-determination, but you don't pursue it because of a belief, then it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;I live a comfortable life style, and I would be accepting of increased  taxation and a reduction of financial power to help other members of my  society. Both because it is a compassionate thing to do, but also  because I see it as a long term investment towards my society.</p>
<p>You don't think you could help them directly? You think someone in your government can make better use of your money to help them? External locus of control.</p>
<p>&rt;I think compassion is also a large driver of progressivism, citing my  own personal feelings and discussions with friends and peers.</p>
<p>I think this just a bias in which you think people who think differently than you are not compassionate. Two people can both feel compassion but implement it in different ways.</p>
<p>&rt;You state that progressivism is deeply rooted in media,  but there still exists an abundance of conservative media.</p>
<p>It pales in comparison to liberal media.</p>
<p>&rt;I won't deny that academia has a large progressive population, however  publications are uniquely capable of being precise and transparent.</p>
<p>No they aren't.</p>
<p>&rt;Can you expand on your notion that progressivism spreads by fear?</p>
<p>Progressivism teaches people to fear, doubt, and reject nearly all institutions, all traditions, and all positions of authority. These negative attitudes are contagious. If several people fear or doubt something, others will be encouraged to feel the same way. And if they don't, they will be pressured by the proselytizers (in a degrading way, of course) to believe the same thing. And if that doesn't work, they will be ostracized, which many people fear too.</p>
<p>The other point to make here is that the news media massively profits off of any kind of fear. It's not like they are in some big conspiracy to make everyone fear something in particular. Fear sells.</p>
<p>And that is true of this entire media/education/research/news structure. There are some cases of conspiracy, but much of it is merely explained by greed. The vast majority of people who participate in this structure and encourage its growth are not in on anything. They see themselves as doing the right thing. There is no leader required for the ideology to spread.</p>

<p>I can and do, but I am a specialized worker. It is more efficent to pay a specialist to do that charity work. The government is an organization too, and one which I can influence via my vote and correspondence with politicians.</p>
<p>&rt;I think this just a bias in which you think people who think differently than you are not compassionate.</p>
<p>I don't think this at all. I entirely agree with your second point. I'm simply stating that the draw of progressive policy is its compassionate nature.</p>
<p>&rt;It pales in comparison to liberal media.</p>
<p>Source? If liberal media is condemning Trump, and &rt;40% of the population still approves of him I think that handedly demonstrates that liberal media is not vastly overpowering other types of media. </p>
<p>&rt;No they aren't.</p>
<p>Your claim that academia doesn't have a higher rigor to its conclusions will be our greatest disagreement. Scientific research follows a consistent and logical process to prove or disprove an assumption. Even if you disagree with a study,  the study is obligated to include hypothesis, method,  analysis, and conclusion. This is a practice explicitly done so that others can attempt a repeat of the study,  or suggest other studies to disprove the hypothesis. It is a painstaking process that takes a tremendous amount of investment. For this reason I treat publications with significantly more trust and weight than any other form of information. Just because media likes to convert scientific literature into misleading headlines and opinion pieces does not make the actual research lesser. </p>
<p>&rt;
Progressivism teaches people to fear, doubt, and reject nearly all institutions, all traditions, and all positions of authority.</p>
<p>Most people consider progressivism to be pro- big government.  Which appears contradictory to this statement. Personally, I have not reached my more progressive opinions from a place of fear. </p>
<p>&rt;Fear sells.</p>
<p>I agree 100%. Which is actually a compelling argument for a non-capitalist news source. I'll also add that polarization/drama sells, and I accuse both conservative and liberal media of fostering fear and polarization.</p>
<p>&rt;education/research</p>
<p>So I see you put these together with the media. Research is dreadfully boring and makes for terrible media,  but due to its thoroughness it carries tremendous weight and value. Please don't confuse the media's sparknotes version of research, with the actual research. Research is an enormous capital investment, with very uncertain returns. This is why we have public funding for more general research initiatives: it's hard to justify private investment as a competitive firm when the ROI is so uncertain. On a national scale that ROI can be massive, and give a country a substantial leading edge (and it has, which is why china and Russia are so desperate to hack and steal).</p>
<p>The only cancer I see spreading, is a breakdown of civil communication. That breakdown is being motivated by the media (literally all of it) because fear and division sells (even if it is ultimately self destructive), and by politicians because powerful emotions like fear and hate gets people to vote and be less thoughtful. The polarization is polar, it is occurring to red and blue.</p>

<p>I don't think we are necessarily in disagreement here. Numbers matter because we're clearly talking compromise and efficiency.</p>

<p>&rt; Scientific research follows a consistent and logical process to prove or disprove an assumption. </p>
<p>That's great as an ideal, however scientific research is heavily affected by funding sources, and scientific communities (especially when small) are easily dominated from within and extremely hard to control from without. To put it all into one example, you have some fields of science in which individuals can affect the direction of research and deter outsiders from auditing for personal gain of authority and money.</p>
<p>&rt; Please don't confuse the media's sparknotes version of research, with the actual research</p>
<p>You're making these points about ideals, which is fine, but has mixed applicability to reality. The reporting of research is as important as the research itself when it comes to informing the public.</p>
<p>However, to be clear, I was referring to the corruption of both aspects: the research and the reporting (and the teaching). These are all arms of the same institution that controls truth.</p>

<p>The government is not made of individual workers?</p>
<p>&rt;People are not blank slates that get written into by experience.</p>
<p>I agree. However you still are not providing a source. Your course of reasoning can be equally well applied to any political camp. So why are liberals disproportionately effected?</p>
<p>&rt;scientific research is heavily affected by funding sources, and scientific communities (especially when small)</p>
<p>This is true and exactly why public funding of research is practiced, obviously it is not perfectly effective. However, the method of recording academic research means: the objective of the study is presented early as well as sources and method. Even if research is 'biased' you can still identify these sources and methods and identify flaws or incompleteness in their sources/ methods and design a new study to test the claim. Do you have any ideas on how science could be made more equitable or transparent?</p>
<p>&rt;The reporting of research is as important as the research itself when it comes to informing the public.</p>
<p>Research is reported in academic journals. Academia doesn't have any legal authority to regulate media's distribution of their work,  and they are not financially incentivized to create digestible interpretations. </p>
<p>&rt;These are all arms of the same institution that controls truth.</p>
<p>Can you identify or name this institution? Do you believe fields of research and education are coordinating to a goal? If so which fields and education programs, and what goal do you think they have?</p>
<p>&rt;I think this is how liberals see it because they believe they are right, and if only they could communicate better to the conservatives, then the conservatives would see things the same way too.</p>
<p>I think most people engage in conversation assuming they are right, regardless of their political affiliations. How do you propose we make compromise or try and satisfy the different needs of 300M people without communication? Your stance on communication seems counterproductive to any possibility of compromise or depolarization.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm putting effort into these posts because I do try to reform my opinions based on new information (consequence of being a strong believer in the scientific method). I respect the dedication to explanation, even if I presently disagree with some of your conclusions.</p>

<p>Yes, but they are no longer spending their own money or risking their own job (messing up in government has a weaker correlation with job loss than in the private sector). When responsibility is removed from power, efficiency will always go down. This is not having 'skin in the game', as they say.</p>
<p>&rt; I agree. However you still are not providing a source. Your course of reasoning can be equally well applied to any political camp. So why are liberals disproportionately effected?</p>
<p>Source that most media is liberal? There is no source for this. Fox is the only major network which leans conservative. The mere existence of Breitbart does not cancel out NBC or CNN.</p>

<li>It was talked about in the 80s (and is today, with the recent publication): https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-liberal-leaning-media-has-passed-its-tipping-point-11590430876</li>
<li>It was talked about in 2004: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/barro/files/04_0614_liberalmedia_bw.pdf</li>
</ul>
<p>But here's the thing: the media is simply not going to accurately report on its own biases. Your best bet for understanding the bias is to read analysis coming from outside of that community.</p>
<p>&rt; Can you identify or name this institution? </p>
<p>More properly, it is a meta-institution. It is an organization that cross institutional boundaries. Neoreaction calls this meta-institution the Cathedral. That should be enough to use your Google skills. I don't have a single source to reference, but this seems like a short enough summary: https://foseti.wordpress.com/2014/01/06/review-of-unqualified-reservations-part-1/.</p>
<p>&rt; Do you believe fields of research and education are coordinating to a goal?</p>
<p>Yes, as with any ideology, it is belief and subservience to the institution that defines it. The Christian church wants churchgoers to believe in Christian ways and to do what the church tells them to do. The Progressive church wants citizens to be progressive and subservient to the clergy of the Progressive meta-institution (the academics, the news media talking heads, the entertainment 'role models', etc).</p>
<p>So, this describes the power structure of the organization, but it still doesn't describe what the belief system of the organization actually is. This is where I diverge slightly from some neoreaction thought. Some people emphasize the connection to Protestantism (or Calvinism), but I don't really think it's that accurate. Early 1800s Protestants are not the same as 2020 Progressives. Late Enlightenment thought wanted a return to how Europe was before the Catholic church came to dominate it and change its institutions. (I realize this is getting long-winded, but bear with me). The actual Progressive mindset, in my opinion, comes from the reactionaries of the Industrial Revolution and the urbanization that occurred in the 19th century. One crystallization of this philosophy comes in the form of the 20th century's critical theory. The progressive mindset has always been to question tradition. To end tradition is to progress. And when that tradition is a power structure, to end <em>that</em> tradition (i.e. <em>to revolt</em> or usurp) is progress.</p>
<p>&rt; If so which fields and education programs, and what goal do you think they have?</p>
<p>This chapter talks about 3 fields which have been affected: https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2009/01/gentle-introduction-to-unqualified_22/</p>
<p>&rt; I think most people engage in conversation assuming they are right, regardless of their political affiliations. How do you propose we make compromise or try and satisfy the different needs of 300M people without communication? Your stance on communication seems counterproductive to any possibility of compromise or depolarization.</p>
<p>My stance is to not play a game in which the rules are not in my favor. I would accept neutrality, of course, which I think your fair conversation has provided.</p>
<p>I think the lack of engagement is at the philosophical level. The base set of assumptions (which are philosophical in nature) that people have makes arguing the finer details impossible. Philosophical discussion is not something that people are naturally designed to do, so they don't care, and they also probably don't have the time or stress-free lifestyle to do so anyway. It's not really our fault. However, from another angle, there are other roadblocks. People are afraid of hurt feelings (their own and others').</p>

<p>There's no reason government funding process can't be changed to better reflect incentive systems. Actually, I think most people familiar with government funding agree it needs to change.

<p>I think it's tragic you hold disdain for academics,  because your thoughtfulness suggests you would make a good social scientist and would have the patience for it. Specifically for scientists and experts, I typically concede their better knowledge on grounds that they have spent significantly more time researching the matter. Likewise to be an effective researcher/ scientist requires knowing what ground has already been covered, which is why specialized scientific communities can feel closed: trying to condense decades of research to someone who is asking foundational questions is a waste of time for those specialists. </p>
<p>Progressive philosophy of questioning tradition is invaluable. Constant self reflection and seeking of new ways to improve is the cornerstone of successful people,  successful business,  and successful society. Making an analogy to science:</p>
<p>Conservatism is the research. As I stated, for scientist to be effective they must first understand what has already been done. Progressivism is the science. Hypothesizing and then testing new systems.  Both are useful and necessary.  </p>

<p>To be clear, I think government funding of research was tremendously important for everything of the 20th century. Chomsky does a good job on this topic.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is not my critique, to be clear. Conspiracy is evidence of a phenomenon if you don't even believe the phenomenon has happened. However, the burden of proof here is higher, and ultimately it is not a constructive or even very descriptive explanation.</p>
<p>I see Progressivism as an ideology that was adopted because it suits the mental wellbeing of industrialized, urbanized, globalized peoples. That is, until issues with it form, and people react to that. This is praxeology: a theory of human action.</p>
<p>My feeling is that either the church has to be destroyed by some outside source (unforunately, probably societal collapse, as the accelerationists want) or through a serious schism such as the East-West Schism of 1054 or the Reformation (which I don't think we are quite right for, but things change fast -- see 2020).</p>

        <p>Both of your sources have flaws in their analysis but I'll start with the common flaw to both of them: the notion that progressivism and even more wrongly science is equal to a religion. The equivocation is made by making the observation that progressivism and religion share common morals. While this is an interesting observation,  your source uses it to conclude that therefore they can be completely synonymous (and proceeds to repeatedly draw conclusions about progressivism by analogy to religions). I propose an alternative theory: your sources have placed the cart before the horse. Religions are a subset of the Value Structure, as is Progressivism. Furthermore religion is definable as the subset of value structures that believe truth and morality is based on a sentient, all pervasive entity(s). Religions then consider ultimate truth to be a known,  based on the laws or will of their higher entity(s) which are captured and perpetuated in religious texts (which fundamentally do not change because ultimate truth doesn't change). Specifically for Science and perhaps partially applicable to the broader science-based ideologies, do not possess any ultimate truth. Additionally,  many of the values of Abrahamic religions aren't even original to those religions. Instead of calling it a 'Church' or 'atheistic Christianity' we could equally well apply the concept to older belief structures: 'Atheistic Zoroastrianism' or 'Atheistic Anamism'. Which predate the Abrahamic religions by 1000s of years. </p>
<p>Your second source attempts to reduce the ethos of science by targeting the character of leaders of scientific policy.  Science is a process of approximating truth via repetitive self-questioning and reduction with measurable data. (Unmeasurable data falls more into the realm of philosophy which is another value structure which predates Abrahamic religions). Science is only as effective as your ability to construct questions, and you will often not guess correctly on a first try. Scientific consensus is therefore so powerful because it can only occur when multiple different approaches are incapable of disproving a hypothesis. It's hard to disprove a scientist,  because scientists are literally in the profession of disproving themselves. Therefore science appears inefficient: the process will inherently generate dead ends and false ideas. This is what makes science expensive, if we got everything right on the first guess we wouldn't need scientists at all. The green scientists they accuse of pushing an agenda despite 'failure' are actually just practicing good science by exploring multiple avenues of solving a problem which has been understood by consensus (most of which will fail). The efficiency of their funding and distribution can be questioned of course,  but the underlying science remains true to concept. </p>
<p>Referring back to the original post and this sub. The critical misunderstanding of science is the belief it's a straight line to the truth. But real science is just a set of theories that have emerged out of the death and destruction of other theories. Something new and urgent like a pandemic exposes the public to the true nature of science. We receive information hot off the scientific press because its urgent,  but the phenomenon is new and therefore the information hasn't been well tested. This results in the information being 'changed' regularly as an onslaught of ideas are being considered, showing promise,  and then being ruled out. Its not that they're lying,  it's that they don't know and are giving the community a best guess (and all science is best guess, it's just that most of them are incredibly stubborn to disprove). This is fundamentally different from any religion,  because religions postulate truth first.  The religious response to a pandemic is (and has been) 'This is God's will'. It's unquestionably true, but offers no actionable information (because actions can be demonstrated to be wrong or ineffective which is devastating to a value structure built on already knowing absolute truth).</p>
<p>So your sources postulate why science is expanding as a "religion". It's because as science has been maturing over the centuries it has accumulated enough best guesses that even non-scientific people can be satisfied by the 'facts' and no longer require a 'divine' source (even if it makes it upsetting when situations unveil how uncertain science still is, because too many people are treating scientists like priests extolling sermons). Then there is the increasing body of people who stick to science, because once you acknowledge the uncertainty of things science offers a very reliable system of intellectual advancement.</p>

<p>This is not a misunderstanding. This is a skill or maybe a personality trait. Scientific practice creates an accumulated knowledge base, and it is a person's orientation to it that determines the rest of the definition. It could be a living set of documents if you wish to actively sort through the documents, make corrections, and come up with new ideas. It could be a bible, if you have no desire to participate and merely wish to use the knowledge for other purposes.</p>
<p>&rt; Both of your sources have flaws in their analysis but I'll start with  the common flaw to both of them: the notion that progressivism and even  more wrongly science is equal to a religion.</p>
<p>I do care about the weaknesses in the modern scientific system, which he provides examples of.</p>
<p>I don't really care about the correlations drawn by the author towards a particular religion. I think the argument format for that aspect of the writing is: A is similar to B. (You think B is bad, right?! Therefore, A is bad too. I'll let you make this conclusion yourself without my providing this logical link, so as not to expose my bias).</p>
<p>&rt; I propose an alternative theory: your sources have placed the cart before the horse. Religions are a subset of the Value Structure, as is Progressivism.</p>
<p>They are still value structures. Normally everyone's personal value structure is to some degree protected by their bias (you can't change their minds because they hold their own opinion higher), but applications of science to your personal value structure attempt to eliminate this protection. This creates a deep systemic vulnerability to corruption. </p>
<p>It is similar to going from many independent states, in which people have direct access to their rules, to a single totalizing state in which one act by the ruler might affect all of the formerly independent states at once.</p>
<p>You say that there is peer review and so forth. Of course, there are some controls in place. It's the same in politics; not even a totalitarian has complete power over his subjects. He needs them to cooperate, and he also ultimately needs to provide for their needs. Returning to the scientific community analogy: scientists still need to publish truth, otherwise they will never gain authority in the community. However, they do not need to be pure in their publishing. Importantly, the lies they publish can be the most important things of all that they publish. This is not just to others, if it is a big lie, but to themselves (in other words, there is plenty of incentive).</p>
<p>&rt; This is fundamentally different from any religion, because religions postulate truth first. The religious response to a pandemic is (and has been) 'This is God's will'. It's unquestionably true, but offers no actionable information (because actions can be demonstrated to be wrong or ineffective which is devastating to a value structure built on already knowing absolute truth).</p>
<p>Affirming truth before discovery is an evolutionarily effective behavior for many scenarios. At an individual level, it can provide certainty in a game where certainty of belief matters more than the content or accuracy of the belief. At a group level, it can result in demographics and societal structure that are more beneficial in the future, when <em>failure</em> actually makes the group stronger (an antifragile principle). I'm talking about a society that doesn't spend all of its health care money on the weakest, laziest, and most unfit; instead it lets the fittest populate its ranks. I'm talking about a society in which people trust each other, based upon a common individual game strategy, rather than a society which is perpetually in a state of discovery, and therefore strategies which are negative in the long-term can be allowed to coexist before that time frame becomes relevant. Sometimes, they are even allowed to thrive and dominate because of  the complete disarmament of the people.</p>
<p>One way these strategies are chosen for in the long-term is simply success or failure: eventual domination or total loss of power. War is crude, but it aligns interests when the war is over and power has gone from a state of disarray to alignment. This in itself is an evolutionary strategy. Why should we give power to those who succeed in war? (Not that you have a choice, but the invisible hand of evolution does...) In order to win at war, you have to be competent. Maybe an incompetent war lord can conquer a tribal village that isn't prepared, but he won't hold it for long. A stronger warlord will come along and defeat him, or the people will simply rebel. So, was there an agreement to transfer power to the person who takes it? No, but someone taking power in itself can give society the most competent to lead.</p>
<p>It sounds like I am advocating for faith-based organization, and yet I am slamming science for being faith-based organization. So, what exactly is the argument?</p>
<p>First of all, the game is to attempt to keep playing. There are successes in politics, only failures. In other words, you cannot say that you "won". You can make things better, but that is merely so you can play the game again tomorrow. This means the system is permanently in friction: you avoid a failure today, and no matter how great your success, you will still have to be on guard tomorrow.</p>
<p>Second of all, the game is always about ideology (and faith). If someone does not have an ideology, either they are unknowingly acting in accordance with someone else's ideology, or they are at least vulnerable to someone else's ideology. So why point out that there are religious metaphors in the education/news/entertainment superstructure? It's to show that this is always in the game.</p>
<p>Third of all, I would like to 'win' this game by continuing to play it. I would like my ideology to do so as well. What could I possibly believe that could support this idea besides selfish desire? I believe in things that humans have practiced for thousands of years. These are things that I believe are natural to human nature, at least among these people who practiced them. I fear that, despite these perhaps being better or more noble values than many others, they are at risk of being stamped out by the mob who also wishes to win, albeit with baser and lower values. That is what is at stake. A single totalizing force has the ability to destroy the work of thousands of years of evolution that has refined a value set that is most optimal.</p>
<p>One last thing: It is late for me, and I fear that I am losing the original thread of this conversation and starting to talk at you instead of addressing actual points. Is there a single question we can agree is in contention?</p>

        <p>&rt;A is similar to B. (You think B is bad, right?! Therefore, A is bad too.</p>
<p>This logic is inconsistent. Firstly, without defining what makes something bad you cannot successfully put an attribute of a subset on an attribute of the whole. Ex. Human is similar to Human&rt;Murderer. Murderer is a subset of Human. Murderer is bad therefore Human is bad too. There the error is more readily exposed,  while it is true that Human shares traits with Murderers it is the specific combination of traits and actions that make murderer bad.</p>
<p>&rt;applications of science to your personal value structure attempt to eliminate this protection.</p>
<p>This is exactly what makes science fundamentally different than religion. Science has no inherent value structure, it is a tool by which you can approximate the properties of any measurable phenomenon. Science places no inherent value on any idea, and (literally in survival of the fittest) only the most factual ideas are able to survive. If an idea is correct, then it can never EVER be demonstrated to be wrong. Even our most solid theories are still under question, the only reason they don't appear to be to most people is because any theory describing gravity still must account for things falling. Most of the commonly observable phenomena of daily life, had sufficiently accurate theories for most applications several hundred years ago.</p>
<p>&rt;Affirming truth before discovery is an evolutionarily effective behavior for many scenarios.</p>
<p>Indeed. Which is why we use scientific theories despite knowing they are still a work in progress. Going back to gravity, we might not know a tremendous amount about how gravity effects time or how it interacts with particular exotic materials,  but for most applications it's not really necessary to have such a high degree of precision. </p>
<p>&rt;I'm talking about a society in which people trust each other, based upon a common individual game strategy, rather than a society which is perpetually in a state of discovery</p>
<p>It hasn't occurred to you that science and discovery is the strategy society is playing right now.  If you want proof that it's made society stronger: why do you think in a world that naturally favors survival of the fittest,  scientific societies are so oppressively strong. Turns out the various gods aren't competitive against discovery of superior crafting techniques, discovery of physics to improve designs, and the discovery of capitalist theory for economics. Even more amazingly because science doesn't care about value structures,  it can be practiced even by highly disparate ideologies. The scientific method is used as an optimization tool for social structures,  economic structures,  and technologies. That still requires a value set to optimize these structures to. You could optimize your social structure with the objective of making it as stratified as possible, and I'm certain you could scientifically arrive at the most economically disparate society ever to exist. </p>
<p>&rt;negative in the long-term can be allowed to coexist before that time frame becomes relevant.</p>
<p>This is an inherent property of this:</p>
<p>&rt;Affirming truth before discovery is an evolutionarily effective behavior for many scenarios</p>
<p>&rt;First</p>
<p>What you just described is a political theory.  If you want to try a more scientific approach: try determining which outcome you desire and then trying various incarnations of political strategy and policy and observe how well the strategy achieves the outcome. Record it so you don't retrace steps,  rinse and repeat. </p>
<p>&rt;Second</p>
<p>Yes. Most social sciences concern themselves with social behaviors as they pertain to social policies that maximize happiness and minimize suffering. They are using the scientific method on what they expect will be productive knowledge, the scientific method itself doesn't make any valuation about its use.</p>
<p>You could become a scientist and study social behaviors as they pertain to social policies that seek some other end. You would still be a proper scientist,  even if you would have political disagreements. </p>
<p>&rt;A single totalizing force has the ability to destroy the work of thousands of years of evolution that has refined a value set that is most optimal.</p>
<p>I believe this is may be the core of what those who reject science fear. Science as a principle places no value on any idea,  and therefore all ideas are at risk of being destroyed. To which I say this: what is it that you actually care about? Do you care about the traditions or do you care about the outcome of those conditions? Science is a method of refinement, but in order to refine you must keep trying new ideas.  If a thousand years of tradition is optimal, it will stand up to scientific scrutiny.  And because I do think our ancient ancestors weren't idiots,  it's likely that many of the tenants of those traditions will carry forward into newer ideas. Why? Because while the technology, the tools, communication, and collaboration are improving to offer more ideas to try. The human condition that's being solved is the same.</p>
<p>Regarding what you see as a meta- institution. I'll provide an example: you give a bunch of blind children a test to describe a rock. Would you be surprised if all the tests came back similar? Scientific consensus isn't conspiratorial or planned its the result of applying a 'truth gathering' method to the same problem with a similar desired outcome.  Maybe you think that some scientific communities could use an infusion of fresh vigor to expand what they're studying. That's a perfectly valid thought to have, but it just has to be weighed against the understanding that science is expensive to perfom. And if you're using it in hopes of demonstrating your ideas to be correct,  be prepared for it to disappoint you. You'll be in good company though,  the VAST majority of ideas ever put to scientific scrutiny have died out. It's very likely that the VAST majority of modern science-informed-policy will be eventually be ousted by the very science that informed it in the first place.  Science is a living document,  if you treat it like a bible you might feel upset and betrayed when it's your pages being edited.</p>

        <p>I do have two social theories for this. Science is a practice of continuous questioning,  therefore it attracts an archetype of highly questioning individuals but as humans they have limited scope of 'Well answered' questions. This reduction of inherent trust means scientists are more likely to take up incentives even if they are disloyal, specifically if the groomers motives sit outside the scientists scope of interest.  </p>
<p>Secondly,  scientists are more likely to take on security risks because they place less value in societal security so their institutions are easier to infiltrate. </p>
<p>I don't see how the Twitter story implies broad scientific conspiracy.  The Chinese government weaponizing their native social scientists' knowledge doesn't seem that opaque to me. Their government has a motive and means....</p>
<p>Scientists are still people with all the imperfection that entails. The ethos of a scientist only holds the 'scientific' weight in the specific field and topic they study,  which of course doesn't bar the person from holding opinions outside that field. You wouldn't be expected to hold your medical doctor's political stance on foreign military exchanges in high confidence, it's not their expertise. However,  their opinion on that matter doesn't reduce their competence as a doctor. Unfortunately media outlets love slapping [SCIENTIST] as a broad qualification, but scientific study is a hilariously large area. The media might as well slap [MASTER MARTIAL ARTIST] as a guest on a story about classical Roman painting techniques, it's absurd. But journalists are paid to make you click, not deliver transparent informative stories.</p>

<p>How different would our response to COVID be if China didn't have terrifying reports of people being locked into buildings and then Italy didn't fall in line with China's astroturfing?</p>

        <p>Well I'd like for our own virologists to at least verify the problem. The frustrating part of China's response was hiding their problem, and then being stingy on details once they realized they couldn't contain it like SARS-2. Frankly if we had gone overkill,  and banned travel sooner this whole thing would've been a small nuisance getting around China's suppliers. But good luck motivating support for that... instead we have the predictable outcome of a highly infectious virus made really hard to track due to it's long incubation time.</p>

        <p>Political tags — such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist,  fascist, conservative, and so forth — are never basic criteria. <strong>The  human race divides politically into those who want people to be  controlled and those who have no such desire.</strong> The former are idealists  acting from highest motives for the greatest good of the greatest  number. The latter are surly curmudgeons, suspicious and lacking in  altruism. But they are more comfortable neighbors than the other sort.  -R. Heinlein</p>

        <p>I mean I'm not a liberal but it seems to me more like things that didn't used to "be political" now are because more people have voices through the internet, social media, etc. Something like a Disney movie with Asian stereotypes or whatever might have seemed harmless when you watched it, but an Asian person could explain why it's actually bad for such and such stereotypes to be perpetuated. </p>
<p>This is why I don't like the whole "why is everything <em>politicized</em>" argument. Everything is political. If something that didn't used to seem political now does, might be worth looking a bit deeper into why than "the left is politicizing everything"</p>

        <p>This is doing serious harm to an entire generation of kids. In my own kids I’m seeing anxiety, regression, depression and loss of social skills due to the isolation. My daughter is 7 and throws temper tantrums again. My 11 year old acts like he’s 5 because he only has his 5 year old brother to play with. My five year old misses his friends and is angry all the time.  </p>
<p>The child of a friend of mine said to me “I want a comet to hit the earth and kill everyone. Then the coronavirus will go away.”  The kid is 7 and he’s nihilistically wishing for a meteor to end it all. </p>

        <p>Because the media, government and public health officials are so shit at explaining things.</p>
<p>I had a friend who thought the virus somehow circled around in the air. <em>Airborne</em> just means carried in tiny aerosol droplets as they are projected into the air -- and it has been known since forever that transmission is possible in this way.</p>
<p>Yes, some data is now suggesting that it <em>mostly</em> happens this way. OK, that's why we have social distancing. That's why mass gatherings and crowded indoor events aren't happening.</p>
<p>But FFS, infection isn't inevitable just because you're in the orbit of an infected person. And then even if you <em>are</em> in their orbit, most people can afford that risk -- especially kids!</p>

        <p>most everything I read gives the impression that infection is inevitable no matter what - mask, no mask, stay home, whatever. This virus is so contagious, that everyone will eventually get it.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then why are people cowering in their homes? You are going to get it some time, may as well be sooner than later.</p>

        <p>You're right! There's a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the doomer narrative. If it's so inevitable, what's the point of all these measures? </p>
<p>In fact, such fatalism actually aligns with supporting herd immunity as an endgoal.</p>
<p>I guess the reason it doesn't is that the same people who are fatalistic still believe that death is a potential outcome for <em>anyone</em> who contracts the virus no matter how young or how healthy, even though we have the data saying otherwise.</p>

<p>Sweden did a study and closing schools had no effect on transmission or death rate when comparing Sweden to Norway. Kids need the social outlet school provides.

        <p>Nope, not even close. I went to quite a few protests, and there was absolutely no rioting involved. Sure there were some protests that devolved into violence, but we can’t generalize to all protests just because of the few that went wrong.</p>

        <p>500,000 dead would mean 99.9% of the population not in nursing homes will survive.  What a fucking joke.  It's mathematically impossible for millions to die.  The fear mongering is pathetic.  It's a bad flu.  It's actually weaker than H1N1 influenza for fuck sake.  9 out of 10 people who get it think it's a cold or nothing at all.</p>
<p>Authoritarians like yourself are going to lose this battle, regardless of how many people die.  You can't force people to wear masks for much longer.  You can't keep schools closed.  Online teaching is a joke.  You can't keep small businesses shut down or restricted.  People need to work.  People need to socialize.  Life must go on.  Simply existing is not enough.  Trying to isolate everyone and control their actions is not a viable long-term solution.</p>

        <p>&rt; 500,000 dead would mean 99.9% of the population not in nursing homes will survive.</p>
<p>Effects depend substantially on age. There’s an extremely high risk of death for anyone over age 60, and worse as people get older than that.</p>
<p>But tens if not hundreds of thousands of younger people could still die, and millions of people of all ages will also have permanent damage to their lungs, hearts, and brains, costing the nation’s healthcare system incredible amounts in the longer term, and leading to a steep reduction in quality of life for those people.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you think a 1/1000 chance of <em>death</em> is a good deal? If I handed you a bag of 1000 $10,000 bills and told you that one of them was poisoned and pulling it out would lead to a painful death plus serious illness for a good number of your relatives, friends, and coworkers, how many bills would you take out?</p>
<p>&rt; What a fucking joke.</p>
<p>If you feel that the already &rt;100,000 people who have died is a “fucking joke”, then it’s pretty hard to have a polite conversation about this. Grow the fuck up.</p>
<p>&rt; It's mathematically impossible for millions to die. </p>
<p>If more than 50% of the population gets infected (this is still below the threshold for herd immunity, assuming people go about their everyday lives without taking strong precautions), and the IFR is about 0.7% (estimates range from about 0.5% to about 1.5%, but it depends a lot on the state of the healthcare system and there is still significant uncertainty), then that will be more than 1 million dead in the USA.</p>
<p>&rt; weaker than H1N1 influenza</p>
<p>This is simply false. Whoever told you this was lying to you. This virus is both as or more contagious and significantly more deadly than all of the flu pandemics of the past century, and we additionally have no natural immunity, no good treatments at scale, and no vaccine. It is roughly comparable (probably not quite as bad, partially due to modern medicine) as the 1918 pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt; You can't force people to wear masks</p>
<p>Agreed. People’s intransigent selfishness is going to cause a whole lot of unnecessary death and destruction, and drag the epidemic out to a much longer time scale in the US than anywhere else in the developed world with the partial exception of the UK. It’s really hard for public health experts to get through a wall of anti-intellectual idiocy amplified by large-scale disinformation campaigns.</p>

        <p>The “dystopian hellscape” is the entire US south and southwest over the next few weeks as hospitals are overwhelmed and tens of thousands of people people die alone drowning in their own mucus and pus in hospital hallways while sleep deprived doctors do what they can, forced to choose to save the younger or healthier patients while letting the others go because they don’t have enough equipment and time to go around. The sirens will be going all day and night, as they were in NYC in March (where more than 1 of every 400 people have died from Covid), as ambulances drive dying patients from hospital to hospital.</p>
<p>The overflow is almost here:<br>
https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/14/texas-hospitals-coronavirus/<br>
https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article244192352.html</p>
<p>Here in San Francisco, where people have been wearing masks, avoiding indoor dining, and more or less acting responsibly, under responsible leadership, there haven’t been any new Covid deaths in about a month, though there will likely be at least a few more in the upcoming weeks. Unfortunately we’re still attached to a country packed with imbeciles, so unlike other parts of the world with locally controlled outbreaks, we will still be stuck dealing with large numbers of imported new cases for another year or more.</p>
<p>The whole of the US is going to stay economically crushed for another 6–12 months, while Canada, Germany, Japan, China, Korea, etc. go about their merry business, having first taken care of their local epidemics.</p>
<p>&rt; Side note I know 3 people who had tested positive [and suffered minor symptoms]</p>
<p>I am glad your friends are healthy. I know several people on the east coast who have died. Sadly we are both statistically likely to see more dead friends and relatives within the next few months.</p>

<p>That said, if the alternative is rotating days, plexiglass barriers, kids wearing masks, no sports or outdoor activities... then, honestly, I say fuck it. Just keep the damn things all the way shut down, and I'll just keep teaching my kid on my own. I'd rather do that than put him through the torture of whatever nonsense hybrid solution the idiots who run the school system would have come up with to make themselves feel better about themselves.</p>
<p>To be fair, this is only about me and my family, because i can easily do my job from home and take care of my kid. I feel for the millions out there who physically have to go out to do their jobs (trash collectors, delivery drivers, truckers, farm workers nurses, etc.) and figure out how the hell their kids are going to get an education in the midst of all this insanity. They are the ones the doomers don't seem to give a rat's ass about.</p>

        <p>It's going to absolutely widen the wealth gap.  The kid with two parents that work from home in a nice neighborhood isn't going to struggle with online classes (Social development mileage may vary).</p>
<p>But the child of a single working class parent in a low-income neighborhood that may or may not even have a good internet connection and consistent food on the table?  Closing down schools hurts these kids!</p>
<p>Everyone who cries out that black people aren't given enough opportunities in life, but also supports school closures is unbelievably hypocritical.  Like I can't even put into words how hypocritical it is.</p>

        <p>Yup. It's one thing to post a selfie on Instagram wearing a BLM facemask. It's quite another to go into the hardest-hit (mostly non-white) communities, volunteer to help feed the hungry, mentor the kids, build job skills, etc. Not a peep about that sort of thing from all these 'defund the police' morons. Yeah... The cops are putting there lives on the line every day working to protect these communities. And somehow they're the problem.</p>

        <p>A while back, maybe 15 years ago, I heard an interview on my local NPR station with this guy named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto">John Taylor Gatto.</a>  He was a successful school teacher who, after being named New York State Teacher of the Year, posted this <a href="http://www.educationrevolution.org/blog/i-quit-i-think/">mic drop op ed titled "I quit, I think"</a> to the Wall St. Journal.  Very interesting guy.  I've followed him off and on ever since hearing that interview.</p>
<p>It's also amusing to note that, only 15 years ago, you could hear this stuff on an NPR talk radio show.  You certainly wouldn't today.</p>

After all, it's too dangerous to work so they shouldn't get the fruits of every other "essential employee" slaving away for them to live their lifestyle. Fuck all of them.

        <p>Man trump could say “the sky is blue” and there will be 100 articles and posts about how it’s actually green and he is wrong. I’m not a trump supporter at all but this shit has become so damn ridiculous at this point it’s not even funny anymore.</p>

        <p>I've already walked away from the left and plan to vote for Trump this election. I don't even like him but it is what it is. As soon as he advocated for schools to reopen, not only did teachers threaten to strike but news articles released about "outbreaks" in summer camps and kids and counselors being infected (even though camps have quietly been open since mid-May; now there is a surge in kids being infected. Hm...and I normally HATE conspiracy theories but I have to wonder). Not to mention that article about the Arizona educator who died recently from COVID has been making the rounds.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen it up close as well, with my 3 kids. The distance learning is a total farce. The kids know it, the grown-ups know it, everyone knows it. No one will listen when someone points out that the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>Are you sure your schools are opening? I know people in the education world and I’m hearing talk of the <em>whole year</em> being canceled until there’s a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I'm expecting some kind of bullshit last minute closure of the schools. I think they're going along with the reopenings just to keep people from really flipping the fuck out, but I'd bet money on it, it won't last. </p>
<p>If it does happen, it's not gonna be anything like the school our kids left. Both of my girls already said they're not gonna wear masks all day, and I know they're gonna be brokenhearted not to have art or music, which were both once a week classes to begin with. I'm wondering if they're even gonna be getting an education or an indoctrination? I know they miss their friends, but another parent suggested having groups of students (less than 10 of course)  meet and study together, parents can rotate the classes.... Didn't sound like such a bad idea compared to the other options.</p>

        <p>100%. So hospital workers, supermarket workers, gig economy people and all the other essential workers are heroes who have to put their lives on the line to uphold a skeleton economy so the whole society doesn’t totally collapse. But teachers — who are on the government dole, who normally are considered “essential” and have been mythologized as heroes in the past, much like nurses and doctors are currently — somehow are more worried about their own personal safety than the futures of the children they teach.</p>

        <p>I mean, I agree it's absolutely essential for a litany of reasons. That comment is just my pithy way of pointing out the hypocrisy of the teachers and administrators who don't want to go back to work this year.

<p>This is mostly coming from people without kids who want to drag other peoples' kids into their political bullshit (or by parents who truly don't understand how dangerous Covid ISN'T to children).</p>
<p>Pediatricians want kids to go back. Perhaps with a lot of considerations and precautions, but bottom line is they want them physically present at their schools.</p>

        <p>I’m in the U.K. and I’m quite strongly left leaning and fairly libertarian but I cannot fathom why we are keeping the schools closed or not functioning properly. </p>
<p>We already know that socioeconomic inequalities lead to profound health inequalities and potentially large differences in life quality. Education was one of the only ways individuals had that could address these inequalities. </p>
<p>How can we possibly defend the extended closure of education over such a risk-benefit event such as coronavirus. I understand the severity of the disease and I don’t say this lightly but to sacrifice children’s educational prospects over the possibility of spreading the virus is unbelievable. If it was a childhood illness with a higher risk outcome I could maybe justify it. But this is not fair at all - especially on the disadvantaged. </p>
<p>Schools need to find a way of protecting vulnerable individuals without sacrificing the life chances of children. It’s not difficult it’s basic infection prevention and control and unfortunately I don’t think the risk can be eliminated, only managed. </p>
<p>What do schools do when there’s an outbreak of similar, or worse diseases? What was the policies there? Can we make new ones? It needs to be done safely and slowly so healthcare doesn’t become overwhelmed but it does need to be done.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the growing #DemExit crowd.  I switched to Green when the Dems cheated Bernie out the nomination - for the second time.  Until COVID I was solidly against Republicans as well, now I will consider Republicans if there are no Independent candidate options this election.  The only Democrat worth voting for is Shahid Buttar (primarily just to get rid of Pelosi), but I don't live in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>I've been angry about this all day. I saw one district in my state flip flop on in person already and I'm worried now that the frenzy over this plus the AAP caving due to political pressure is going to cause the whole state to shut school down in the fall.</p>
<p>I got tore up in the Indiana subreddit today for saying I wanted to send my daughter back for her senior year and I hoped it didn't set a precedent for other schools to close. </p>
<p>I had someone actually respond to one of my comments with this:</p>
<p>&rt;You're a fucking psycho with what I can only assume is a fetish for large piles of dead bodies. Please stop advocating for more death. Your voice on this issue is going to get people killed, probably you or your friends and family. I hope not, by the way</p>
<p>I know they're trying to get a rise out of me but if COVID was certain death why on earth would any sane parent want to send their children there? Yes of course, certainly I'm advocating for the death of all teachers and students because I hate my kid and her teachers and want them all dead. Do people even hear themselves?</p>
<p>I cannot even believe we've come to a day where I'm aligned on education with Donald Trump and Betsy fucking DeVos who is basically a public school busting cultist vampire. Like seriously what the fuck, everything is all upside down.</p>
<p>Everyone who is politicizing this should be ashamed of themselves and people who don't have kids and don't teach or work at a school need to stop egging this on.</p>
<p>What I'm actually doing instead of just being mad on the internet is organizing a letter writing campaign right now to make sure the state and local school districts don't cave to the pressure.</p>

        <p>I don't get the demonization of unions in your country. Do you even know how good you have it now thanks to unions? Business owners were literally poisoning and irradiating their employees to death so they could save money. Unions put a stop to all that. If a union is getting involved it's probably because the boss is fucking things up for everyone.</p>

        <p>Maybe they don't want to see one of their students get sick and die? Teachers know the kind of responsibility they have to bear. The way Americans generally treat their teachers is disgusting. There's no respect for them. If someone's kid were to catch covid at school and die, who do you think they would blame?</p>

        <p>Wow. Name-calling. Nice one. You sure showed me. It's not zero though is it? And the parents of the kids definitely don't have a zero percent chance of dying, do they? In fact it's high enough that someone in that kids family could end up in the hospital from an infection. And since nobody's working, no one has health insurance either. Maybe instead of sitting around calling everyone bad and retard, you should find a way to educate your kids in a pandemic. That way at least your kids will have a bigger vocabulary than you do.</p>

        <p>I never considered myself on either side because I despise politics entirely (the only strong political opinion I have is on abortion, and that's based on my personal beliefs, not the actual politics of either side), but this is the first issue I've really firmly been on one particular side about. It's weird, though. I didn't intentionally side myself with them.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I thought lockdown beyond 2 - 3 weeks was utter nonsense, but the schools reopening is what I feel most strongly about because of my niece. She's in NYC. I just read the guildelines for NY schools. She misses school so much, but she will be miserable if she goes back with those restrictions in place. She won't be allowed to be with her friends, she won't return to dance class, she won't have music class. But remote schooling was awful. Even she knew it was crap. It's so unbelievable kids have had one of their most basic rights - education - ripped away from them.</p>

        <p>My daughter called me out on that one. I kept saying “I’m a liberal, but.” She finally said, “maybe you’d feel better about things if you resolved that cognitive dissonance.” Smart kid, that one. (I know, spoken like a true mother.)</p>
