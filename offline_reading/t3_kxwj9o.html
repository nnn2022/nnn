    <strong>YIPPEE</strong>
    <p><p>Oh how I love online/hybrid school! I have to use this shitty program known as Blackboard and guess what? Yesterday and today I can’t access any of my classes! For some god damn reason the course page won’t load up. I emailed the tech experts (or whatever they’re called) at my school about this, and they suspected my Chromebook was malfunctioning and they’ll replace it. By the way, I’m only having problems with blackboard. I can access anything else with ease. Well, I don’t really care since the Chromebook was offered by the school for free. So I guess I have a 5 (It’s technically 4 days. I have in-person Tues and Thurs because yesterday I pretty much did nothing during class but we are still dependent on Computers) day vacation instead of 3 days (Martin Luther King day is this upcoming Monday). But yeah, this is the quality of education the American youth is getting.</p></p>

        <p>I honestly don’t understand why people want school to be remote for the rest of the year. I have decent internet yet I can’t even access any of my class sessions. This wouldn’t be happening if I was getting educated in-person. Imagine being too poor to pay for internet and your school was doing remote 2-5 days a week. I doubt the McDonald’s free WiFi is of any good quality.</p>
