        <p>It's a lot harder to go against the crowd and stand up for your beliefs than to go along with what everyone else is doing.  We become the targets of people spewing hate at us.  We're not telling anyone what to do or what to believe, we just want to be left alone.</p>

        <p>OP, you've got to understand that "hate" isn't actual incitement to violence based on someone's traits (which is already a crime, at least in the USA and most other places) but wokespeak for "heretic."</p>

        <p>When I was growing up, I imagined things like the American revolution as being the general consensus throughout the country at the time. Like there was this huge push from the common people toward independence. </p>
<p>I realize now that there are always going to be those who would rather be protected from the rain underneath someone’s foot than be free and get a little wet. I respect the people who spoke so passionately about freedom and independence so much more knowing that many thought it ridiculous, dangerous, and laughable. </p>
<p>We learned about civil rights leaders like Dr. King and Malcolm X, and though they were inspiring to me I again didn’t see the struggle. See, being “anti-racism” in the 90s and 2000’s wasn’t radical, but we thought we were just as woke as the freedom fighters in the 60’s. It’s easy to go with the social narrative, that isn’t bravery. That isn’t risk. The people who started that shit were speaking out in a time where the general consensus was “fuck no”. </p>
<p>I really think we’re in one of those times right now, and though it’s far more difficult than I was led to believe in school, it’s <em>supposed</em> to feel that way. You don’t get to be courageous if you’re spoon fed your “virtue”, it comes in the times when support is the lowest.</p>

        <p>They targeted gamers.</p>
<p>Gamers.</p>
<p>We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.</p>
<p>We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.</p>
<p>We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.</p>
<p>Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.</p>
<p>Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?</p>
<p>These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.</p>
<p>Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.</p>

        <p>Not sure how this comment relates to the topic here but gamers these days are some of the most conformist mainstream narrative drinking "science" worshiping jokers around. Generally because instead of spending all those hours privately educating themselves on history philosophy and economics, they sat around leveling up fictional characters in a fictional world presented to them in games that promote witchcraft.</p>
<p>Nothing against gamers though, i am one also, but that is the reality of the situation.</p>
