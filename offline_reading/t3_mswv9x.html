        <p>I’m anti-birth control, but they have a point. Imagine if all the women who wanted to take the vaccine stopped taking their pill? Abortions would skyrocket, which IMO i think is worse</p>

        <p>Should we not first investigate clinical studies on the interplay between the vaccine and other drugs?</p>

        <p>Oh definitely. But like the article says it’s wise to talk to your doctor first, although I don’t even know how much we can trust our own doctors anymore..</p>

        <p>I know I don't trust MY doctors.  I was already overweight for awhile and was have period irregularities, but I absolutely did not want birth control because A) I wasn't having sex B) a lot of birth control had the side effect of blood clots among other terrible shit.  So I went to my doctor about my freaky uterus wondering if I had cysts or something and instead of recommending tests she just tried to push birth control on me so I said no, cuz I'm fat, I'm already AT RISK for blood clots, are you trying to kill me?  I'm gonna try some other things first... I tried soy milk, because you give soy milk to women going through menopause and it actually worked!  When I told the doctor, they dismissed me and my solution and just moved onto the usual 'you're fat, fix it'.  I found out about keto diet through a Pokemon youtuber and I was sick with myself, so I tried it and lost over 45 lbs and look great, though I stopped drinking soy milk cuz it's not very keto, my period did a purge then became regular again because my hormones were more balanced out now that I wasn't overusing my pancreas by eating carbs and sugar.  Again, when I told my doctors this, they STILL dismissed me and my solution and said I'm still fat as well as took the credit for the fat I had lost because they'd told me to instead of just me getting sick of myself and finding my own solution.  These people really are quacks.</p>
<p>Sorry about long</p>

        <p>Thats all good information though CZebra, it does make you wonder how much better public health would be if we concentrated on dietary and lifestyle adjustments rather than going straight to the pharmaceutical options.</p>
