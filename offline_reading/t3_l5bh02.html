    <strong>They claim Sweden gave up on thier "failed" strategy and has succumbed to lockdown...</strong>
    <p><p>As of 10th of January:</p>
<p>Immediate restrictions introduced:
The government has taken immediate action following the bill’s approval. From January 10, many indoor venues including shops and gyms must limit the number of visitors to a maximum of one person for every 10 square meters. Additionally, private events will be capped at 8 people.</p>
<p>This limit doesn’t apply in private homes, although Swedes are being encouraged to limit social contacts. "We cannot regulate how people move and who they have contact with at home, at the gym or in shops; rather this is where the general recommendations apply," said Public Health Agency general director Johan Carlson.</p>
<p>Does that sound like a stay at home order to you? 
Does that sound like shops and businesses are closed? 
Do thier case numbers and deaths appear higher than elsewhere? </p>
<p>The media literally lie about Sweden. </p>
