    <strong>Source/fact mega thread needed!</strong>
    <p><p>Well folks we are truly in unprecedented times. My views have shifted during the past months and I cannot believe the hypocrisy I am seeing by our so called leaders. The misinformation everywhere has made it difficult to make decisions and I for one want to make sure that my rights are protected (Canadian here but all are welcome) and my well being also.</p>
<p>I invite everyone to comment down below and explain what your stances are on the pandemic, on regulations, and most importantly what you have found to be true. Please source if possible so others can make informed decisions from your post.</p>
<p>I have seen several family members catch covid and although they were sick they are fine now,some have lingering effects. My family members have been vaxxed but are doing fine. But I just know that there is something corrupt happening. </p>
<p>Please help me in justifying my stance against this covid nightmare and help others in making informed decisions. I would like to see some sort of nonewnormal fact-check thread.</p></p>

<ol>
<li>Whatever your age, you have a risk of Covid. It is a small risk if you're younger, but a risk nonetheless. The vaccine will reduce that risk even further. (Source: <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know">https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know</a>  and   <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/getting-a-pfizer-or-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-can-drop-your-risk-for-infection-by-91">https://www.healthline.com/health-news/getting-a-pfizer-or-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-can-drop-your-risk-for-infection-by-91</a>)</li>
<li>The vaccine protects you against all known variants right now. Catching Covid protects you against that strain and you can still catch other variants.  The vaccine protects you by creating an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience sickness. (Source: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01222-5">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01222-5</a>)</li>
<li>The vaccine offers longer lasting immunity than catching Covid does.  (Source: <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/marty-makary/92434">https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/marty-makary/92434</a>)</li>
<li>The vaccine stops you spreading the virus if you have it but don't have symptoms. (Source: <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1112">https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1112</a>)</li>
<li>People cannot shed the vaccine, and the vaccine does not make you magnetic (Source: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html</a>)</li>
<li>Even if you consider yourself low risk, if you don't have the vaccine, you may still get the disease and not know it, and then accidentally pass it onto others around you who are at higher risk. If you get the vaccine, you reduce that risk of spreading, and therefore, reduce the risk of infecting others. This will reduce the number of deaths and hospitalisations, and get the waiting times for other illnesses back down. At the moment, because of Covid, waiting lists are at 5 years. If people got vaccinated, it wouldn't spread, people wouldn't get ill, and hospital resources would be freed up. Vaccines save lives - not just by protecting against Covid, but also by saving the lives of cancer patients (among hundreds of other illnesses) by ensuring they get treatment quicker.  (Source: <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-record-high-hospital-waiting-list-in-england-as-5-1m-need-treatment-12329156">https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-record-high-hospital-waiting-list-in-england-as-5-1m-need-treatment-12329156</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Finally, for those of you worried about an experimental vaccine, it might be worth knowing some facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>This explains the rigorous and detailed testing and scrutiny that the authorisation process requires. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained</a></li>
<li>Every single component part of every single vaccine has been in development for years. The viral vector vaccines are the same type of vaccines that have been used for 50+ years. The mRNA vaccines have been used for other things, plus they've gone through huge amount of testing over the past decade. Recent technology advancements have improved the delivery method, which has allowed this vaccine to be made, but they absolutely did not just start making it a few weeks ago!  (Source <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-did-we-develop-a-covid-19-vaccine-so-quickly">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-did-we-develop-a-covid-19-vaccine-so-quickly</a>)</li>
<li>All types of vaccines have been given to hundreds of millions of people with an incredibly small number of problems. Out of 138 million vaccines in the US, there have been 280 deaths. This is 0.000002%. These deaths are also not yet confirmed as vaccine related. It is more than possible that these are coincidental, as people die all the time, and it's obvious that some of them would have had the vaccine recently. Even so, using the highest possible number gives a tiny percentage.  (Source <a href="https://fullfact.org/online/1102-vaccine-adr-death/">https://fullfact.org/online/1102-vaccine-adr-death/</a>)</li>
<li>mRNA stays in your body for 72 hours. So, you will have the same long term effects 73 hours later than you will 10 years later. There is absolutely zero evidence whatsoever about infertility, "lumping" of spike proteins in organs (that doesn't even make medical sense), heart problems, or anything else. (Source <a href="https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/18587406#:~:text=mRNA%20in%20the%20cells%20disappears,sooner%2D%2Dby%2024%20hours">https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/video-player/18587406#:\~:text=mRNA%20in%20the%20cells%20disappears,sooner%2D%2Dby%2024%20hours</a>.)</li>
<li>It is absolutely worth noting that any side effects the vaccine does give you is your body's natural immune response. Sometimes, this is mild or severe, but it is the exact same response that your body would have done if you caught Covid for real. The vaccine isn't anything else other than replicating the Covid spike protein. It causes the exact same response. So, if the vaccine is responsible for any side effects, that person would have experienced those side effects from Covid anyway! The vaccine does not cause side effects that Covid would not have caused. </li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The exact combination of the vaccine ingredients plus the delivery system is new. Point 1 above mentions how individual development has been happening for a while, but it is obvious that the entire package as a whole is new.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't pose new risks.</p>
<p>Consider this comparison. Samsung build a new phone, the Galaxy S30. They have added one or two new things into it, a more powerful camera and GPS chip, for example. That exact phone would have had no long term studies, because it's new. There's no data on how it effects people 10 years in the future. It might cause cancer for all you know. But people trust it, because it's an established technology. It is the exact same with the vaccine. There have been no long term studies, but like the phone example, it does not mean that it's unsafe.</p>

        <p>0 people have died after the vaccine. Confirmed by NHS, CDC, VAERS and WHO.</p>
<p>The vaccine massively reduces your risk of infection or reinfection. Massively.</p>
<p>If you are super old and have lots of underlying conditions, the vaccine will reduce your risk. But you will be left with a higher risk still. That's just obvious common sense.</p>

        <p>&rt;The vaccine massively reduces your risk of infection or reinfection. Massively.</p>
<p>Yet hundreds are dying. FUNNY THAT it clearly isn't working.</p>
<p>If you are super old a standard flu (like this one) would have killed you anyway.</p>

        <p>Well the mass vaccination to healthy people that would otherwise have been fine with Covid. Endless lockdowns and mask regulations. People losing their businesses. The G7 photos that are everywhere today of politicians socializing without masks. The addition of covid statistics from people that died of other causes. Lots of things just seem fishy and I would liked some sourced information to refer instead of just someoneâ€™s word as I wrote here.</p>

        <p>Youâ€™re way off base. Plenty of healthy people I know where not â€˜fineâ€™ with covid. The problem is that many of the covid deniers subscribe to the false dichotomy of covid having a life or death outcome but fail to consider morbidity. Personally, I got the vaccine bc I donâ€™t want to deal with even a mild case of corona. Same reason we immunize against zoster in the USA; shingles is unlikely to kill you but itâ€™s still miserable so why not protect yourself if you can. Iâ€™m a believer that at this point itâ€™s your choice to vax and it shouldnâ€™t be forced, but most healthy people prefer to not deal with any form of preventable illness in the first place even if you end up being â€˜fineâ€™ in the long haul</p>

        <p>Thanks for your insight, I think I am just concerned that people who may have been ok with covid are also getting sick for a week from the vaccine, so is that any better and will there be long term effects? Vaccine passports are discriminatory and people should not be segregated for choosing not to take a vaccine that is in an experimental phase.</p>

<p>Yeah the long term issues are the million dollar question. If you look into viruses tho, which unlike bacteria have a more systemic nature, youâ€™ll see viruses can have some nasty impacts that donâ€™t show up for years (hpv for example). </p>
<p>The side effects from the vaccine are very real tho, so plan for the worst if you get it which as you pointed out, could be a fever and feeling like crap for a bit. The benefit is that you donâ€™t have a virus replicating in your cells. Personally, my arm was real sore after the second dose and I was pretty tired for a day but that was about it</p>

        <p>Yes I totally understand that people will have medical issues regardless of taking to vaccine or not but there seems to be a pattern of blood clotting, myocarditis etc. Just from what Iâ€™ve read itâ€™s something that needs to be considered. Itâ€™s still early and I donâ€™t think enough studies are out yet but even from VAERS minimal reporting it shows a pattern in cardio vascular side effects.</p>

        <p>Yeah I donâ€™t disagree with anything that you wrote. Itâ€™s new and weâ€™re still learning. Fair to say that at this point, for most people, the benefit of the vaccine outweighs the risk. Certainly can change as we learn more about the long term impact (or lack there of) on both ends.</p>

        <p>Yeah I donâ€™t really disagree at this point with my parents or the more at risk population getting it but as a 28 year old with fine health I see no reason to risk getting side effects from an experimental vaccine that is not yet FDA approved and only gives marginal immunity and not even for the variants that are probably mutating because of the population vaccinating. There are articles that argue both sides of that discussion.</p>

        <p>Youâ€™re certainly on the lower end of the risk spectrum based on what you wrote so I get why you would want to hold off, especially since other high risk people have had their chance to get it by now so itâ€™s not like your doing it to benefit them. My reason for getting it was entirely self centered. Like you, Iâ€™m in great health (as far as I know) but Iâ€™m 15 years older. My thought was that I had seen enough people younger than me wiped out for over a week with covid, some of which had an incomplete recovery, that I didnâ€™t want to risk taking my self out of work and dad duties for a week. Plus, we donâ€™t know the long term impact of the virus, though i suppose a similar argument could be made against the vax (viruses have a crappy track record for coming back later in life tho)</p>
