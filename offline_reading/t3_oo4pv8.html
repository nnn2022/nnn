    <strong>This is how the French will fuck with the "Pass Sanitaire."</strong>
    <p><p>First we have the protests. If those keep on, they'll turn to riots (same as the Gilets Jaunes did).</p>
<p>Second we have the lawsuits. Groups of mall owners, restaurant owners, and the like.</p>
<p>Third the nurses, other healthcare workers, and healthcare support are quitting (it is unclear if they'll get fired, or if the government will allow them to remain employed and try to fine them to death).</p>
<p>Fourth the Pompier (Firefighter++. They fight fires and are first responders for multiple things) are starting to say "No" and quit (unsure how it works for the Pompier, so I'm usure if they can quit or not).</p>
<p>Now the smaller cinemas, and some gyms are saying "Ok. Less than 50 people in at one time. It sucks, but we won't play this game."</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll be able to add more to this as the time comes, or this shit falls flat on its face and we don't have to worry about it for a little longer (I have no illusions that they would try again, even if the current government was completely replaced.)</p></p>

        <p>Businesses are the 'tip of the spear' to enforce these measures.</p>
<p>It won't be the government or police blocking you access to food, medicine and essential services.</p>
<p>Most business owners are not going to forego their $$$ to uphold your rights, freedoms, liberties or body governance.</p>

        <p>Most won't, but some will.</p>
<p>I'll take my allies where I can get them, and I'll continue to go to my gym.</p>
<p>The owner knows damned well that those who live in his gym (including himself) won't get vaccinated, and he can't afford a 45k+ fine (this isn't a franchise joint), so he is doing the best he can with the hand being dealt. My membership was up last year, and when I could I went to the gym (both last year, and the beginning of this one) the whole time the owner never asked me for a penny, I ended up asking him if he wanted anything and he said "No, just pay this year, last year was a fluke".</p>

<p>I don't care. I will have to lose my income, some opportunities, long term plans and even my preferred choice by where I live, and may have to take a hiatus on my normal job and take a job I may not usually do.</p>
<p>To assert my rights.</p>
<p>At least him being a gym, it is 'non essential' to my life. But his compliance emboldens others to do the same, and many of them are food, medicine and essential services.</p>
