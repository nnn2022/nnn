    <strong>Hello folks</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone have solid proof that there is a significant risk of dying after taking a vaccine. A lot of people seem sure if this but I can't see any evidence of a lot of people dying. </p>
<p>I know there has been a few deaths from blood clots and such but that only affected a tiny amount of people. Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>There have been multiple posts to the vaers and eu-equivalent site showing what has been reported. There are also some anecdotal accounts of people claiming to be censored and silenced when reporting any side-effects at all, making the actual numbers (which also sometimes get reported as coincidence not causation) hard to pin down.</p>
<p>Age stratifying the data does suggest those who weren't at any risk from covid are at a higher risk from the vaccine, including children and fetuses.</p>
<p>I do recommend doing some searches here before essentially running in and yelling "i demand proof!"</p>

        <p>Thanks I didn't know that was a thing. The vaers says 4000 people died after getting a vaccine but it's hard to see if that was the cause. Most of the deaths were older people so that suggests it's not the cause of death for most of them</p>

        <p>While you're not wrong, one must be careful with this assertion.  To weigh the value of a vaccine vs a disease, you need numbers that are comparable.  If we start dismissing "old, so probably not the vaccine" while still including "old, had a positive PCR a month ago, must be covid" we will have greatly skewed data.</p>
<p>This is obviously nontrivial, but crucial to weighing risk.  There are some interesting analytics in vaccine fatality reporting and vaccine volume, the timing of which does suggest a relationship.  I don't have them to hand, I feel like @EthicalSkeptic has posted such.  It's interesting that only the skeptics seem to be doing these studies (that I've seen...) whereas the pro-vaccine crowd falls back to "it's safe!" and "trust the experts" while dismissing the cdc-hosted vaers as inapplicable.</p>
<p>Getting good data is very difficult, so we must pursue it ever more tenaciously to really understand the risks, and by and large this is not being shared if it is done, we're merely hearing catch phrases and bribes/coercion.</p>

        <p>You're looking for solid proof when studies are still ongoing. This is an unknown, all we have are trends that something might be happening.</p>
<p>In VAERS, it's about 30 in 1 million that reported deaths after covid vaccine. Of those, 4 in 1 million occurred on the same day as vaccination.</p>
<p>This is only a partial risk indicator, because it doesn't account for age, relative risk to encountering or dying from covid, long term disability, any long term effects, etc. So it's not just black and white numbers anyway.</p>
<p>But that's what we have right now.</p>

        <p>I think that plays a huge part here. Perception. Because for me I know only a handful of people who actually tested positive for “Covid” and all of them had hardly any symptoms at all. Whereas I know just as many (if not a couple more) who have been perfectly healthy people, got vaccinated, and then had horrible reactions. One guy I know was perfectly healthy at 40 years old and got his first shot, he then developed fluid around his heart, fluid around his lungs, blood clots and now is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer!! Where there is risk, there must be choice. Thats only fair.</p>

        <p>What I'm aware of there is none. The predictions are we should face them 18-24 months post-vaccination, if they are to come, thus we just need to wait.</p>
<p>However, you should acknowledge it doesn't really matter. Rushing the vaccination for mostly curable disease with so little testing was gambling that should never have happened.</p>

        <p>It's about 12 months now since trials started. I think that's close enough. Its very unlikely that people will be affected at this point so I think the risk paid off</p>

        <p>I don't find it unlikely, but just unknown. Remember thalidomide? They tested it four years, put it on market and yet later found it caused estimated 80 000 stillbirths and 10 000 - 20 000 injuries in newborns like missing limbs and such.</p>
<p>It is far too early to deduce much. And the mass vaccination has not been on 12 months, that only applies the first tests.</p>

        <p>There will be some people that die almost immediately, and some that have no side effects at all, and some that develop side effects later, and some that will die from it in the future. It is too early to say now, apparently the full effects will take up to 2 years to see. As far as I know, most of the people that got the vaccine from my family have not had side effects, however some have (eyesight and heart related), and 2 ended up in hospital with stroke. Its a mixed bag, but we really will have to wait and see what happens further down the line to make any real conclusions. But I personally think the vaccine is more about control, where we will be excluded for not having it, and they will use it to control people's finances etc. Also, possibly sterilisation which will only be apparent far later on. I don't think people will be dropping like flies, that is just way too obvious.</p>

        <p>"causing" people to die?</p>
<p>The way covid deaths are recorded (at least in the U.S., same is true in the UK as well) is that if someone dies "with" covid, that gets counted. Here is Dr. Birx stating as much:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHp1GdOD4k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHp1GdOD4k</a></p>
<p>And Dr. Ezike (Director of Illinois Public Health) reiterating the same thing:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw9Ci2PZKZg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw9Ci2PZKZg</a></p>
<p>So it is grossly inaccurate to say that covid has 'caused' 1 in 300 people to die. All we know is that about 600k people have died with a positive PCR diagnosis. To what extent covid is causal or incidental cannot be teased out from that figure. We also know the PCR tests are often calibrated to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">overly sensitive</a>--anywhere from 30 to 40 Cts--and thus pick up covid cases that are not covid cases in any clinical sense.</p>
<p>In that regard, the definition of a covid death isn't too dissimilar from the VAERS database, which records deaths post-vaccine, but makes no inference as to the cause of death. Thus far, there are about 5,000 deaths in the VAERS database. However, we know that VAERS reports are massively understated--<a href="https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">a report from Harvard Pilgrim</a> notes that fewer than 1% of adverse events are reported. So we know the 5,000 is an understatement--how much is difficult to say, but if it reflects only 1% as noted in the report then we're talking upwards of 500k or more actual deaths. In other words, we quickly approach the same death toll as covid itself. Again, no indication that the vaccine is causal for all those deaths--but there is no indication covid is causal for the covid deaths either.</p>
<p>So there is a double standard that occurs here, where the non-skeptical covid crowd asserts that all the covid deaths are "caused by covid" whereas all the vaccine deaths are incidental. But you don't get to pick the definition that suits your narrative, that is, you don't get to have a different standard for "death" in the context of covid vs the context of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The truth is that it is difficult to tease out causality. But we do know that the covid vaccines have led to more death reports in VAERS than any other vaccine (combined!). We also know that VAERS massively underreports vaccine incidents. In the past, for other vaccines, vaccine distribution has been immediately suspended upon 25-50 VAERS deaths--and now for the covid vaccines we have 5,000 deaths, and still the rodeo goes on. So all these factors combined don't create a ringing endorsement for the vaccine. And the calculus gets even murkier if you are young and otherwise healthy, since covid poses virtually zero risk to such people. It gets even more egregious when the government urges people who <em>already had covid</em> to go get vaccinated--for these people, the vaccine is literally zero upside and all downside risk; any thinking person should start to question the motivations at work here when such things are encouraged.</p>
<p>But if you are demanding proof of "significant risk of dying" from the vaccine, that is simply you painting people here with a very broad brush. This is a heterodox forum with lots of varied beliefs, but most people here see the issues as much more nuanced than just "OmG EvErY1 WhO tAkEs ThE VaX WiL dIe!!!1"</p>

        <p>Exactly. I'm one of those nuance guys. I think even with the very real risks, vaccinations make sense for people in certain risk groups. As for me, with new studies showing people who had and recovered from this brand of cooties, the vaccine probably provides no additional benefit, and so, probably makes no sense for me to risk a vaccine that likely provides no benefit.</p>

        <p>Then that qualification is easily met. 5,165 reported deaths. VAERS is a self-reporting system, meaning those results are expected to be understated, perhaps significantly understated (historically only 1-10% are reported). Any previous vaccine would have been pulled off the market after a few deaths, maybe a few dozen deaths at the extreme upper limit. Thousands is unprecedented. It is more deaths than every other vaccine combined.</p>

        <p>That includes people that died of other things soon after being vaccinated. It's possible that a few hundred people died from the vaccine but that's unlikely. still not even very bad considering 85% of deaths are in over 60s, and they have a much higher risk of dying from covid</p>

        <p>Because the natural death rate for young healthy people is tiny caompared to over 60s. So if they die after taking a vaccine it's easier to say the vaccine killed them.</p>

        <p>It still reduces your chances of holding and spreading the virus by a solid amount. I think they are exaggerating that a bit to reduce people's movement. It definitely reduces the reproductive rate enough so that the virus will die out when most people are vaccinated</p>

        <p>This is the problem. There is speculation on all sides. Contradicting information is being purposely spread and nobody knows the truth.</p>
<p>Like what is a “Solid Amount”?</p>
<p>How does it reduce the chance of you “holding and spreading”</p>
<p>You either have a virus or you don’t, you either spread the virus or you don’t.</p>
<p>You think they are exaggerating to stop peoples movement when in reality enforcing lockdowns are what’s doing that and nothing else is needed. Also I would like to ask if they are exaggerating this 1 point, what else is being exaggerated? What else are they being misleading about? How far does that go?</p>
<p>What has ever died out do due vaccination? Literally nothing. All the diseases we have vaccines for are actually still around.</p>
<p>I would argue the big difference is we have much “cleaner” lifestyles and that’s led to drops in these diseases, but none have just gone away</p>

        <p>My mom was anti-vaxx, so I grew up without them. Im 100% healthy, fit and have nothing in terms of allergies, food intolerances and what have you. Thats a rare, very rare sight these days at least within my peer groups I can safely say Im among if not the healthiest. My sick days are basically non-existent.</p>
<p>So I gotta wonder, am I the exception? Or, are humans per se healthy, but we become increasingly unhealthy due to our lives? Sure, there are thousands of other factors you can consider here, but certainly vaccines might be in there.</p>
<p>If I look at health datas, I dont feel convinced that vaccines cant be ruled out as a major factor.</p>
<p>Add on to that, that Im very interrested in science and history. Science history shows time and time again that we assume things to be healthy/good that turn out to be bad later on. These time scales however can be quite long at times.</p>
<p>With Vaccines Id like to give them a couple more generations before Im convinced, until then Im perfectly happy being in the control group.</p>
<p>Also there are philosophical thoughts on health. which I just a while ago have seen put together quite nicely by an expert, its in german but if you are interrested you might find a decent translator:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aerzteblatt.de/archiv/32976/Gesundheitssystem-In-der-Fortschrittsfalle">https://www.aerzteblatt.de/archiv/32976/Gesundheitssystem-In-der-Fortschrittsfalle</a></p>
<p>Basically it discusses our perception of health and how progress in the medical field leads to more sickness by redefining the very meaning of health.</p>

        <p>Vaccines don't affect your day to day health. They prevent you from getting sick from deadly diseases. You haven't been affected by those disease because everyone else who is vaccinated protected you by not spreading. </p>
