    <strong>The youth willingness to be controlled frightens me</strong>
    <p><p>Had a babysitter watch the kids tonight. Asked what her 4th of July plans were. She said a friend was gonna take some of them out on the boat but they were gonna cancel those plans now because the new mask mandate will make it hard to do and won’t be as fun if we have to wear masks on the lake. Same kids probably won’t listen to their parents but the governor says they have to obey, so they comply. I don’t get it.</p></p>

        <p>I understand your point of view. However at least she doesn't enjoy the mask. Life will be at a really low ebb if people start to enjoy living with a muzzle on.</p>

        <p>If the majority of people ignored the mandate it would go away. I’m convinced that 1/3 of people are pro-mask, 1/3 of people are against it, and 1/3 of people are spineless and afraid of getting in trouble, so now you have 2/3 of everyone on the mask wagon.</p>

        <p>Ugh. People around these parts keep claiming this.</p>
<p>"It's only 1/3 of people" or "It's a handful of people who really believe this!", etc. I think it's more than 1/3, honestly. We can't really ignore that there's many, <strong>many</strong> people who are terrified of the virus, and only feel comfort in the mask. There's also people who are "spineless" but many just don't want to have to deal with angry Karens and possibly cops everytime they head out somewhere.</p>

        <p>It is probably 75-80% if not more because they truly  believe the virus will somehow disappear, scared with tail between its legs, if we wear masks.</p>
<p>The sheer ignorance of what viruses do, how they behave, and the media pushing the ignorance is why we are in the state we are.</p>
<p>Now we have states where the Gestapo will come get us if we aren't compliant little sheep.</p>

        <p>You may be right. I’m certain there’s a direct correlation between the amount of news consumed and the amount of fear one has of the virus... also on a deeper level, the people who are genuinely afraid of the virus may be having their first existential crisis. The type of people who would try to hold jurisdiction over someone else’s face, are exactly the type of people who have probably led miserable boring lives, full of regret and missed opportunities, and now they are both dreadfully afraid of dying, and at the same time happy to feel like they are a part of something big.</p>

        <p>I think people have a really unhealthy relationship with death. I understand that even at 33, I could be dead tomorrow for various reasons, such as a freak accident. I have seen people on social media arguing that their 90-year-old grandmother has “years of life left”. It is so interesting from a sociological standpoint how people cannot process death in a healthy and realistic way.  This is why the lockdowns frustrate me, a year of not being able to live a good life is a long time of missed memories and adventures.</p>

        <p>I'm all for a masks during a real threat or even a seasonal respiratory disease, like in Japan. But flu season is long over and the context of an Asian wearing a mask and an American is far different.
An Asian wearing mask in NYC is not uncommon,  in fact, they were the only ones wearing them before covid. </p>
<p>I was an avid mask wearer, I wore them effectively and was very careful in its handling. This is not the same as some clown who wears "fashion masks", that has been brought from the street, thinking that they are effective. </p>
<p>Again, usually only hospital workers know how to effectively use them. The general public does not and all of these crisis actors and fed posters online are essentially using the term "mask" as a semantic indicator to measure who is compliant to mandates or not. </p>
<p>This idea that Asians live longer because of mask wearing is a complete farce. You cannot compare people who have a rice diet, stay the same weight since high school and age gracefully to an American who seasons their food with grease, sugar and salt and expect them to have the same health outcome.  Diabetes among Americans is FASHIONABLE and it's one of the TOP risk factors for having a hard time with the CV. They are not healthy runners. </p>
<p>To add if the non contagious Asian meme was a real thing, CV would have never left China.</p>

        <p>I agree, although it probably depends where you are at. I live in a state that mandates masks but in a small town/rural area and the majority of people are against it or are part of the spineless/don’t want to get in trouble percentage. I’d say probably far less than 1/3 are actually pro mask here. Stores and gas stations in town have the mask required sign posted on the doors but pretty much no one enforces it or cares.</p>

        <p>That’s exactly the makeup of my friend group. 1/3 of us are mask worshippers, another 1/3 are spineless and how to them, and the remaining 1/3 (myself included) see this for what it is and don’t comply. I try civilly debating with them, but even though they can’t counter my arguments, they’re too stubborn to admit they’re wrong. How can I civilly convince them they’re wrong and make them willing to listen, this bullshit is causing a divide in the friend group.</p>

        <p>As one of the older people on Reddit (58) I am really puzzled as to why there isn't more anger amongst younger people. There are some great, articulate younger people on this sub of course and on others, but more widely, I don't understand why they are not out on the streets raising hell about this. We are literally sacrificing the future of young people to give a few more months life to old folks. I know my father (93) doesn't want that. He wants my 16-year old daughter and her generation to have a full life full of opportunity. </p>
<p>Please don't take this as intergenerational criticism - I hate all that Millennials v Boomer stuff. We are all in this together and people from my generation are just as passive and ill-informed, maybe even more so. I'm just surprised that BLM or the environment will get people out in numbers, but this hasn't, when it is the younger generation that will be most affected.</p>

        <p>That's a great point. I think about my 92 year old great-uncle when this conversation comes up about protecting the elderly/vulnerable. He's very at risk. This virus would indeed kill him. He is mad as fuck that he can't go to his senior center and have his coffee with his friends every day. (He has since resumed going, but couldn't for a couple months). Did anybody bother to ask the elderly/vulnerable if THIS is how they want to live their last years? Locked away in their house, or even worse, inside their little tiny room at the nursing home?</p>

        <p>No. No, they didn't. And when the 70-year-old Lieutenant Governor of Texas said very early on, "No one came up to me and asked, 'As a senior citizen, is this what you want?'" he was vilified as someone who wants to kill grandma for the stock market, rather than hailed as the voice of a generation who understands risk assessment and has decided they don't want to live their last years in fear and isolation.</p>

        <p>&rt;  I am really puzzled as to why there isn't more anger amongst younger people</p>
<p>I can't prove this but I think a large fraction of the young people who aggressively push for more restrictions are casually breaking them in their own lives, and feel justified when they do it. It would match the way they approach so many other things ("Well sure, when <em>I</em> do it it's ok, because XYZ, but we can't trust <em>other people</em> to do it" is a very very common perspective amongst arrogant, entitled, elitist upper-middle class youth)</p>

        <p>Its very odd to me that following exactly what the media says to do is now considered by younger people to be "anti-establishment". When I was in high school it was the opposite. I think its the social media. There were no cell phones until I was in college. They are constantly bombarded with information and its left people unable to think critically.</p>

It's not surprising that the generation that was never allowed to play outside alone and who need trigger warnings and safe spaces is easily terrified and compliant with authorities who promise to protect them.</p>

        <p>Same here my brother, except I’m 16. What me and a few likeminded friends are doing is going to a bunch of businesses without following mask or social distancing bullshit and seeing how many enforce it. We’re in HelLA, Commiefornia so there are a lot of Karens and COVID-doomers who could snitch on businesses, but the business owners I’ve talked to say they put the “mask required” and “stay 6 feet apart” signs up so they don’t lose their business license, but won’t enforce the bullshit. It’s clear the government won’t enforce it either, just look up Santa Cruz County caving to beachgoers who ignored the closing of beaches.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you do what we’re doing, if a business enforces it, leave and tell them something like “then we’ll take our business somewhere else” and if someone tries to get confrontational you can either make Karen jokes or just ignore them and move on. If a business doesn’t enforce it, then patronize them. Go in groups because more people means more paying customers that a business would gain or lose. Good luck brother, don’t give up the fight!</p>

<p>We have political correctness and hiding behind your sofa wearing a mask. How utterly embarrassing.</p>

        <p>I don’t consent. My body my choice. If they think it makes me an uncaring individual, it doesn’t do any good to argue with them over it. It’s like when someone calls you a racist and you start naming your black friends to prove your not. There’s no winning the argument with these nosy Nancies. The only course of action is civil disobedience.</p>

        <p>One of my kid’s teachers told her and her classmates on the 1st online meeting that they should start practicing wearing masks and get ready for the “new normal”!! This was after she attended a meeting with the school board, of course!! They have been indoctrinating our kids into this for months, and now that summer is almost halfway over, they’re slowly introducing mandatory masks in many states... Because it will be easier to enforce and force kids to wear masks to school or stay home if that’s how it is in public everywhere</p>

        <p>I don’t know what percentage of young people are all following strictly these guidelines. But I don’t think if they are it’s just because they were told to, it’s because the reporting on this pandemic has made them terrified. You have 22 year olds who think they might die or have permanent lung damage if they ever catch it, which is not backed by data....but there’s so many stories in the news media and social media of that one person or few their age who died/had complications.</p>
