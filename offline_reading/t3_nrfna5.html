    <strong>Could July 4 actually be the end of this (at least in the United States) or are they going to shift the goalposts again?</strong>
    <p><p>They've shifted the goalposts time and time again in regards to herd immunity.... but what I've noticed is their end date has never changed yet, Biden is still saying July 4 since march/April 2021 and even promised free beer and childcare if 70% of Americans get vaccinated (the amount of bribing and begging is suspicious of course, though).</p>
<p>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-promises-free-beer-and-childcare-if-70-of-americans-get-at-least-1-vaccine-shot-before-july-4-11622660877</p>
<p>With this, it implies that Biden's end date is July 4 this year. What's everyone's theories on this? I have a feeling its a carrot on a stick tactic, but I'm not entirely sure though since I dont think the media will make Biden look like a fool, which would definitely make him lose credibility if they shifted the goalposts all of a sudden, rendering all the hope in the vaccines utterly useless (which is what they DON'T want, majority of the believers have put their hope in the vaccine as the "ticket back", so they have too much to lose if they decide to suddenly pull a "just kidding", especially with all the skeletons in the closet lately like Fauci's emails, wuhan lab investigation, loss of trust in public health officials, etc).</p></p>

        <p>I dunno. Ending it would give a lot of cover for them trying to sweep the emails under the rug. Plus, extending it would undermine Great Leader's predictions, and the establishment is going pretty much all-in on the "Biden is jesus" narrative.</p>
<p>I can honestly see it going either way.</p>

        <p>My theory is this, and this is not an attempt to hijack your post, but I firmly believe while they will roll back probably 75% of the martial law, they will keep some of it. The July 4th "deadline" is more of a soft goal post by Biden.</p>
<p>At least here in America, a lot Americans were duped into buying into the scam, and therefore, we passed the litmus test on what we are willing to be conned into. Further more, I do not believe, by a long shot, that these evil people are not done. They will find a reason to keep this going in one form another.</p>
<p>The best way I can relate this is if you look at the Native American experience here in the States. Once the general government pushed all the Native Americans onto the reservations, do you think they were done with them? Problem solved? Nope, they still are destroying them, well whats left of them that is! So if you think July 4th is the "deadline" for this nonsense to end, oh no, they haven't even gotten started yet.</p>
<p>The media, especially the MSM, can not afford for this to end. Think about that. Every one is tuned into the news, receiving all that advertising money and for that to go away suddenly? Think of all the money they will be losing because the "pandemic" is over by July 4th. It is my view, Biden's handlers told him, July 4th is when this ends, and we go onto the next manufactured crisis.</p>

        <p>There will likely be a last-minute date change and few people will be behind it. Few people will want to follow any guidelines and nearly everyone will call bs to go live life like we have been in many places.</p>
