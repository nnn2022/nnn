    <strong>Is it just me, or are some businesses now openly hostile to customers?</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone noticed that certain businesses are acting like we, the customer, are imposing on them by willingly walking into their establishment with the intent to spend money? I'm writing this a day after an extremely rude and confrontational barista told me it "didn't matter" that I have a medical exemption because I HAD to wear a mask and if I didn't like it I could wait outside, which I did. Like some kind of disobedient dog being punished. It's like, I don't NEED coffee, I don't need to spend my money here, and you're going to come at me rudely? At least she could say something like "I know it's annoying, but if we don't ask patrons to wear a mask we will get fined" or something. And besides, our city's ordinance has an exemption for medical issues, but apparently that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I know doomers will say that private businesses can have whatever rules they like. To which I say, if every private business makes no exceptions for masks, then people who can't wear masks are effectively locked out of society.</p>
<p>What happened to being kind to people because you don't know what they're going through?</p></p>

        <p>Honestly if I had a business I’d let people in with out masks just like I would if they were wearing one.  I for one want to keep customers and would only kick someone out if they were causing a disruption or loitering. Want to come in with out a mask? Welcome! Want to wear a mask? Welcome!</p>
<p>Want to cry because I let a non mask person in?</p>
<p>BYE! don’t let then door hit you on the way out.</p>

        <p>I think this whole mask and social distance thing is an exercise in control and compliance, not an exercise in public health.  That being said, some businesses  - at least in my state - face steep fines, closure, or even criminal charges for not following the health director's edicts.</p>
<p>Do you live in one of these areas?  If so, the barrista may have been instructed to do this.</p>
<p>If not, he's just a punk ass, virtue signalling POS who I wouldn't want making my coffee anyway. Spend your money with a shop that values its customer's right to <em>have</em> rights!</p>

        <p>The thing is, the ordinance allows for medical exemptions. So why should a business face a fine on behalf of a customer with an exemption?</p>
<p>I understand it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation, but the tone of the (female) employee was so hostile and rude. The FIRST thing she did when I entered was bark at me that I needed a mask. She could at least have been polite about it, but she immediately put me on the defensive.</p>

        <p>Where I am the mandate states specifically that businesses cannot be fined for allowing those with medical exemptions to shop maskless. However that doesn’t stop these businesses from denying entry even when you say you have a medical condition. In my experience around 80% of stores in my area won’t let me in without one no matter what, and many don’t offer any sort of curbside or pickup service as an alternative. Unfortunately the ADA has made it clear it won’t help in this situation. It makes me so mad</p>

        <p>Exactly what u/irunfortacos77 said: businesses won't face fines when allowing those with medical conditions inside, but every shop I have been to won't let you in without a mask.</p>
<p>The actions of the woman working there would piss me off beyond belief.  I probably would send an email to Starbucks or the location's manager about it and tell them they lost a customer because they neither respected you as a customer nor your medical condition.</p>
<p>We have to start calling out these mask nasssssi's because if we don't, the herd mentality will allow it to become the norm.  Fuck the new normal!</p>

        <p>I know it's uncomfortable. But next time be prepared and find the courage to tell her to call her manager. Immediately, or call yourself in a loud voice. Then complain to her manager in front of her how unfriendly she was and that you are going to inform the regional management, if they don't apologize. Probably manager will instantly apologize and give you a free coffee. Managers are always way more friendly, smart and relatable than normal staff (that's why they became managers...). If not, walk out. You have spoiled their day then already :)</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you said, I just want to share that I went to a certain grocery store today and the guy at the door just smiled and said okay have a good day when I walked past him without a mask.  So it’s not everyone, there are decent people out there.  But overall I have noticed a lot of power-tripping asshole people, and idk if it’s just me, but I’ve had a lot of really bad service lately.  Like they’re laying off workers, adding extra fees to everything, and the service and products are worse quality, slower, etc. for more money!  Kind of a tangent there but overall yeah I agree with you</p>

        <p>She handed me a mask too! I put it on covering my mouth and she said it had to be on correctly. Then she said I could wait outside. Such an unbecoming way to treat customers. I wonder if this is some kind of corporate policy.</p>

        <p>I'm starting to wonder that to. The one I went to was in North Carolina. I bet it is. It was dehumanizing so I made a couple snide remarks and walked out.</p>

        <p>Yeah a smoke shop / adult store wouldn't let my boyfriend and I shop without a mask even tho we said we had a medical thing. First place to deny service because they're private property. But I thought store policy couldn't infringe on state constitution?? </p>
<p>Pisses me off especially since the first thing that ever comes out of anyones mouth is "you need a mask!!!". No "hey hows it goin" or any type of basic manners anymore.</p>

        <p>I’ve been saying this whole time that the mask laws are discriminatory to anyone medically exempt from wearing them and all I get in response from people is: “they should wear it anyway!” Or “there is curbside pickup!” Or “you ONLY have to wear it from the door to the table” which doesn’t even make any fucking sense!!! My father in law is deaf in one ear and relies on lip reading. My GIL is completely deaf and doesn’t know ASL, relies 100% on lip reading to communicate with the outside world. It makes me angry seeing hay the same people who “fight for equality” throw it out the door when it doesn’t fit their agenda.</p>

        <p>I live in a state with no mask mandate. I went to a coffee place with some of my friends and no one said a thing about no masks. There’s no signs on the door or anything. I went back about a week later and an employee said I have to wear one. I asked why there’s no sign that says so and he just shut up. After I ordered I went to the area to pick it up and the girl said they don’t require masks for customers but her coworker is a control freak.</p>

        <p>The mask mandates are designed to destroy small businesses.  You can't win.  If you treat your customers like humans and let them choose, you'll end up paying a big fine.  It's horrible and sad :(</p>
