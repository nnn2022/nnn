    <strong>Rebellion needs to be a highly coordinated, and unified effort, otherwise it's useless.</strong>
    <p><p>My point being that yelling in the streets isn't doing shit but causing violence and arrests. I think yelling outside a governor's house is exponentially more effective. These are the kind of specifically targeted acts we should be focused on. When a small business goes against orders, support them. When a big-box store comes out with new testing proof/ va((ination policies, boycott them relentlessly.</p>
<p>I made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jx63c5/id_really_like_to_see_a_resistance_platform/">a post about starting a platform</a> to organize people behind various causes a few weeks ago, which didn't gain much traction (good concept, but perhaps more complicated than need be). I'm now working on an educational open-use flyer for people to distribute around their communities. </p>
<p>Focus on educating people with logical points, not aggressively confronting them. The more people that begin to see that the mainstream media is vastly deceptive, the larger our cause, and the rebellion grows. </p>
<p>Love all of you here&lt;3. We will not be silenced.</p></p>

        <p>This is an incredible idea. Need to make the people at the top know we mean business. I have been going nightly to the mayor in my city's house wearing nothing but a mask and wrist strap for my megaphone to prove how requiring of anything is unconstitutional and I have/know my rights as an American.</p>

        <p>The problem isn't organization, it's lack of numbers. You have to have enough people that they can't arrest all of you, can't easily separate and identify leaders, can't kettle or block your route, etc.</p>
<p>That's how BLM, AntiFa, and Extinction Rebellion get away with their bullshit (that plus complicity from city officials, which partly stems from the size of the protests).</p>
<p>But of course, to get numbers, you need organization - the chicken and the egg problem, so to speak.</p>
