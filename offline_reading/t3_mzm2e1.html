        <p>I don't understand why losing your sense of taste temporarily is supposed to be this massive deal we're all supposed to be afraid of. I don't know about anyone else, but that happens to me all the time when I get sick. Sometimes it doesn't last very long, other times I'm dealing with it for longer. Who cares!</p>

        <p>One of my friends is the most upset about the loss of his sense of smell and taste.  He was really fat, though his bad health made him lose weight after surviving covid. </p>
<p>He still gets emotional about saying his sense of smell isn't as good as it used to be now.  </p>
<p>I would be fine with losing my sense of smell and taste, because then I could just eat healthy, boring food for the rest of my life and save time, money and calories.  </p>
<p>He is pretty nasty and unsympathetic to my immense fear of vomitting and how much distress a month of nausea from a vaccine would cause me.</p>

        <p>Taste and smell are closely linked in the brain, which is why your taste gets messed up when you're sick usually (can't smell properly, so can't taste properly).
As far as I can understand, losing smell or taste from Covid is bad because it's a brain problem rather than a lung problem, but I can't find any actual evidence.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns are not an 'individual liberty vs group well-being' argument, nor are they a 'health vs the economy' argument. These are FALSE dichotomies designed to corral us into a competing rights debate. What is fundamentally at stake is ALL lives, liberties, and prosperities on the one hand, and gross arbitrary restrictions which are based on malice, not science or reason, on the other</p>

        <p>I would say that being an infectious disease shutting down the country and making people isolate in their homes will obviously reduce the spread while those measures are in place, that’s just basic logic, but anyone with common sense can see why that isn’t a solution. </p>
<p>I agree on what you said about this not being about freedom vs collectivism though. As I said in the video anyone who’s afraid of getting it can isolate and still protect themselves and us not doing the same thing and moving on with our lives won’t give them covid.</p>

        <p>Thing is, there is science on both sides regarding the reduction of transmission by lockdowns/social distancing. However, even if lockdowns do slow transmission, this is not necessarily a good thing:</p>
<p><strong>Journal of Epidemiology:</strong></p>
<p>“Epidemic theory dictates that a reduction in the force of infection by a pathogen is associated with an increase in the average age at which individuals are exposed. For those pathogens that cause more severe disease among hosts of an older age, interventions that limit transmission can paradoxically increase the burden of disease in a population.”</p>
<p>“The link between limiting pathogen exposure and improving public health is not always so straightforward. Reducing the risk that each member of a community will be exposed to a pathogen has the attendant effect of increasing the average age at which infections occur. For pathogens that inflict greater morbidity at older ages, interventions that reduce but do not eliminate exposure can paradoxically increase the number of cases of severe disease by shifting the burden of infection toward older individuals.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652751/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652751/</a></p>
<p>And at the end of the day, who gives a shit about mild cases all that matters is overall mortality—and the science is <em>very</em> clear on lockdowns not saving lives and has been for decades. Here are just a handful of the dozens of studies for reference:</p>
<p><strong>The Lancet Journal:</strong> </p>
<p>“Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30208-X/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30208-X/fulltext</a></p>
<p><strong>Aarhus University:</strong> </p>
<p>“Comparing weekly mortality in 24 European countries, the findings in this paper suggest that more severe lockdown policies have not been associated with lower mortality. In other words, the lockdowns have not worked as intended.”</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665588">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665588</a></p>
<p><strong>Frontiers in Public Health Journal:</strong> </p>
<p>“Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be linked with death rate.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full#SM6">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full#SM6</a></p>
<p><strong>Journal of the International Biometric Society:</strong></p>
<p>“The most notable feature of the results is that fatal infections are inferred to be in substantial decline before lockdown.”</p>
<p>“Taken together the results for England and Wales and for Sweden are strongly suggestive that full lockdown may not have been necessary to avoid health service overload, and more limited measures might have been effective.”</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.13462">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.13462</a></p>
<p><strong>Tel Aviv University:</strong></p>
<p>“We would have expected to see fewer Covid-19 fatalities in countries with a tighter lockdown, but the data reveals that this is not the case”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128520v1">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128520v1</a></p>
<p><strong>Frontiers in Public Health Journal:</strong></p>
<p>“On balance the lockdowns cost a minimum of 5X more WELLBY [years of well-being] than they save, and more realistically, cost 50–87X more. Importantly, this cost does not include the collateral damage discussed above (from disrupted healthcare services, disrupted education, famine, social unrest, violence, and suicide) nor the major effect of loneliness and unemployment on lifespan and disease.”</p>

        <p>To be fair, that freaks me out too. A relative lost his sense of taste and smell and he’s a brewer and beer taster. That’s an actual job. He can’t do it any more, though. He’s lost the subtleties.</p>

        <p>That's 99,9% stress related. Sleep and hair loss are stress symptoms. 
You'll find the ones with those symptoms are the ones most afraid and/or believe official narratives the most.</p>

        <p>Your post only mentioned hair loss. Don't know why you bring up the taste and smell.      </p>
<p>&rt; I think it’s a bit too coincidental that people who had Covid just happen to have similar symptoms</p>
<p>Did you do some research? Were they even confirmed cases?     </p>
<p>Do you know that in <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/26/long-haulers-dilemma-many-cannot-prove-they-had-covid19/">a survey of "long haulers", only 23% even had a positive test?</a></p>
<p>Going by Occam's Razor, we have hair loss. Could it be because of....</p>
<p>a) A media pandemic in which <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33144785/">mental disorders are at an all time high</a>, with constant fear bombardment form said media.       </p>
<p>Mind you, we <a href="https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/symptoms/hair-loss">know</a> that stress causes hair loss.      </p>
<p>b) A <strong>respiratory</strong> disease, with <strong>respiratory</strong> symptoms.    </p>
<p>Btw, <a href="https://www.raleighcapitolent.com/blog/lost-sense-of-smell?entryid=109&amp;tabid=89">loss of taste is also a respiratory symptom</a></p>
<p>Which one could it be?</p>

        <p>&rt;Covid attacks the nervous system.</p>
<p>Covid attacks the respiratoy system, as all coronaviruses do.    </p>
<p>Occam Razor time again: </p>
<p>We have <strong>option A)</strong> </p>
<p>&rt;According to the Mayo Clinic, any condition that obstructs your nasal passage or flow of air through your nose can cause you to lose your sense of smell. </p>
<p>These conditions include:</p>
<p>The common cold.  <br>
The flu.   <br>
Sinusitis.   <br>
Chronic congestion.  <br>
Nasal polyps.    </p>
<p>Or, <strong>option B)</strong></p>
<p>&rt;There are also neurological conditions that can cause anosmia. Although uncommon, the olfactory center of the brain---the part used for processing the sense of smell--- can be damaged by:</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease.   <br>
A brain tumor.   <br>
Head injury.  <br>
Diabetes.  <br>
Exposure to harmful chemicals such as insecticides
Certain medications. <br>
Zinc-containing nasal sprays (these have been taken off the market).          </p>
<p>Being a respiratory virus, from the same family as the common cold, is it more likely to be like a brain tumour or alzheimer, or could it just be behaving like a regular respiratory virus?</p>

        <p>It’s not a regular respiratory virus. Many of the complications are neurological- ‘brain fog’ aka dementia, tinnitus, pain/loss of sensation/pins and needles in the limbs, heart arrhythmia. If it was an ordinary respiratory virus, the respiratory system would be damaged but the rest of the body would be ok. Did you ever hear of anyone having long term confusion or limb pain after a cold?</p>

        <p>You're literally describing symptoms from forced isolation and anxiety. It's absolutely irrational to assert those are related to a respiratory disease (with no evidence) when there's such a blatant cause in front of everyone's eyes.     </p>
<p>Covid IS NOT DIFFERENT that other respiratory illnesses. It behaves the same way, it literally follows the same transmission mechanisms, same symptoms, same sequels, same immunity patterns. </p>
<p>&rt;So when you hear about vaccine side effects, do you apply the same ‘logic’? The side effects are similar to a lot of other conditions so you’re going to argue that they’re not due to the vaccines at all?</p>
<p>It seems that there is a straight correlation between vaccine administration and subsequent blood clotting (in the brain, in limbs, heart, and even could be affecting women's periods).       </p>
<p>I don't think that has anything to do with the other stuff though.</p>

It is a respiratory virus that is usually mild in younger people but sets off a whole train of complications in older people and people with pre existing conditions.

        <p>It’s not similar because it’s not affecting people in a ‘cohesive group’. It’s happening to random people all over the world. Mass hysteria appears in schools or among people who have some kind of social or locational connection.</p>

        <p>Random people in the same society and, for the most part with the same characteristics and sharing source of the problem: media. </p>
<p>We're in a globalized world. When you're isolated and only have social media... Social media is your social or locational connection.         </p>
<p>And I haven't said covid doesn't exist lmao I don't get your other post. Covid is real, but it's overblown and it's being given irrational superpowers such as being able to cause brain fog, anxiety and all that without a physiological explanation.        </p>
<p>The symptoms from mass hysteria or nocebo effect are real as well. I'm not saying people with hair loss are lying. I'm just saying it's not the virus causing it.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the Tourette outbreak in NY 10 years ago? The tourette symptoms were damn real. And local news were accusing a chemical spillage from 40 years ago to be the cause and nonsense like that.       </p>
<p>Most of them are 100% fine now. Cause they chilled.</p>
<p>That's a very good example of what's going on.</p>

        <p>In my husband’s case, the ‘narrative’ was getting recognition and a diagnosis. Why were these weird things happening to his body? Why couldn’t he do the things he enjoyed doing before he had Covid? It was a relief to find others like him and to know he wasn’t just ‘weak’ or ‘anxious’.</p>

        <p>So when you hear about vaccine side effects, do you apply the same ‘logic’? The side effects are similar to a lot of other conditions so you’re going to argue that they’re not due to the vaccines at all?</p>
