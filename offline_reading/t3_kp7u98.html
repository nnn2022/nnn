    <strong>When has it ever been socially acceptable?</strong>
    <p><p>When has it ever been socially acceptable to:</p>
<ul>
<li>not cover your sneeze or cough in a tissue, armpit, etc?</li>
<li>not follow the "say it, don't spray it" rule?</li>
<li>not practice basic hygienic practices?</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think any of these things have never been socially accepted for a long time. I think the majority of people cover their sneeze/cough, talk without spraying spit, and wash hands often. </p>
<p>So I'm having a hard time understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does asymptomatic spread even work if you don't have symptoms like sneezing or cough? </li>
<li>How can it happen to such a degree that people are convinced people who may be asymptomatic should be feared? </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, at least in my experience, people who felt sick proceeded with caution. For example, they would warn people that they were feeling sick and they would keep their distance from others out of respect. </p>
<p>I guess my final question would be: why are masks being pushed on the general (healthy) public when the vast majority of people are capable of doing the things I've listed?</p></p>
