    <strong>The shroud of the Dark Side has fallen. It is the silence heard round the world.</strong>
    <p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dILSt_EQgNM&amp;t=182s">5-minute video</a>, Dr. Mercola, the most valuable resource for personal health on the Internet, explains how he is being forced by the Biden administration to remove all content from his website.</p>
<p>50% of what I know about health I learned from Dr. Mercola and his guests. He has empowered tens of millions to improve their health over 25 years. Naturally, in our cronyist system, that makes him an enemy of the state.</p>
<p>This is a very dark day for freedom as <a href="https://endofinnocence.com/fascism-explained-conformism/">Fascism</a> comes out of the closet. The shroud of the Dark Side has fallen. It is the silence heard round the world.</p>
<p>There can no longer be any doubt--The <a href="https://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/">Apex Players</a> are in their end game.</p>
<p><a href="https://leagueofrealpeople.com/government-cronies-gang-rape-vaccine/">We were already being gang raped by government and its cronies slapping us around until we agree to let them inject us with their fluids</a> ....</p>
<p>I declared in July 2020 that the American people had been defeated, and by January 2021 that America was no longer America, and in July 2021 that we have been living in The Toxic Age of The Apex Players for some number of years. (I can't decide when it started exactly.)</p>
<p>I am not sure the best name for this particular point yet, but one thing is always true:</p>
<p><strong>When have the book burners ever been the good guys?</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: The Ministry of Truth has put Mercola's site down the memory hole by excluding it from the Wayback Machine. If you try to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/Mercola.com">find Mercola.com there</a>, it says "This URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine." Now as they continue to lie about Mercola and his site, humanity cannot do what they fear most--examine the facts and think for ourselves.</p>
<p>We should always accuse everything censors say of being a lie after they censor because if they don't want to be seen as liars, then they must leave the evidence and let us think for ourselves.</p>
<p>In the future, they could even deny the site ever existed, but as bad as that sounds, it could be even worse. They could replace it with a propaganda site of fabricated content to corroborate their lies.</p>
<p>Allies and useful idiots for the Apex Players will claim that Mercola censored himself of his own free will, and yes, he chose the life of himself and his family .... his employees and their families .... and his allies and their families .... over the site, and he he did so without any guarantee that it would appease the regime (I don't think he knows the <a href="https://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/">Apex Players</a> exist yet). </p>
<p>That 's how it worked in the USSR too. People were rarely directly censored, but they censored <em>themselves</em> because they did not want a knock on the door at 3:00 AM, after which, they may never been seen again.</p>
<p>Establishment goons and their allies will claim they would not have actually killed them, but remember, they are now proven liars and tryants, and we must assume that anything they say in their defense is a lie. We must assume that their motives could be as bad as the worst regimes in history.</p>
<p>If they would say that their <a href="https://leagueofrealpeople.com/presidential-medal-freedom-madeleine-albright-murder-iraqi-children/">killing 500,000 Iraqi children to get rid of Saddam Hussein was worth it</a>, then how many more would they kill to maintain the illusion of legitimacy? </p>

<p>it started in the 3rd century a.d.</p>
<p>it came to a head in the 16th with the 'reformation', which resulted in the 'counter reformation'</p>
<p>the political world was then 'counter reformed' from city-states, kingdoms and empires into secular corporate nation states</p>
<p>we are experiencing and witnessing the wrap up now, though we most of us won't live to see the end scheduled for 2100</p>

<p>the next phase is Agenda 2050, it's focus is on 'regionalization' as the population begins to decline in the 2040s by attrition, the goal there is move the slaves out of rural areas.</p>

        <p>they put pieces in place ahead of time so they are there when they need them</p>
<p>for example, all these dictatorial powers when a public heath emergency' is declared (no need for actual one only the declaration) were put in place starting in 2003, right after the war of terror was launched</p>
<p>they are already working on A2050s regionalization in the background. they are still putting the final touches on A2050 and havn't formally published that yet.</p>
<p>they have already regionalized local governments though.</p>

        <p>It is interesting that they seem to do all this through black letter law as you mention, this started years ago. Why do they do this? Itâ€™s like if they canâ€™t manipulate the law the right way they canâ€™t do it.

Now as they continue to lie about Mercola and his site, humanity cannot do what they fear most--examine the facts and think for ourselves.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We should always accuse everything censors say of being a lie after they censor because if they don't want to be seen as liars, then they must leave the evidence and let us think for ourselves.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In the future, they could even deny the site ever existed, but as bad as that sounds, it could be even worse. They could replace it with a propaganda site of fabricated content to corroborate their lies.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Allies and useful idiots for the Apex Players will claim that Mercola censored himself of his own free will, and yes, he chose the life of himself and his family .... his employees and their families .... and his allies and their families .... over the site, and he he did so without any guarantee that it would appease the regime (I don't think he knows the Apex Players exist yet).<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That 's how it worked in the USSR too. People were rarely directly censored, but they censored themselves because they did not want a knock on the door at 3:00 AM, after which, they may never been seen again.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Establishment goons and their allies will claim they would not have actually killed them, but remember, they are now proven liars and tryants, and we must assume that anything they say in their defense is a lie. We must assume that their motives could be as bad as the worst regimes in history.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If they would say that their killing 500,000 Iraqi children to get rid of Saddam Hussein was worth it, then how many more would they kill to maintain the illusion of legitimacy?</p>

        <p>So, in your head, if Mercola didn't take down his site there would be a knock on his door at 3am and he would never be seen again?</p>
<p>You haven't <em>proven</em> anything about any liars and tyrants---that's all in your head.</p>
<p>How about Mercola is a dangerous quack who knows lawsuits are headed his way and he's setting himself up as a martyr so he can keep grifting you?</p>

<p>Let's suppose it would come in the form of lawsuits. Who do you think creates and enforces lawsuits? What are the worst possible outcomes of lawsuits? Given how there are no longer any rules, imagine the worst possible procedures and outcomes.</p>

        <p>Okay, then Mercola's the "bad guy" because he's burning his own books.</p>
<p>If he's got so much truth on his side, why doesn't he stand up to the "censors" and just not take his stuff down? (again, nobody is forcing hi to take it down, he just decided to). Why doesn't he <em>make</em> whoever is against him <em>actually</em> censor him, then he can fight out in court under his first amendment rights---he definitely can afford lawyers and all his marks would donate to such a thing. And no, it's not because he will be "disappeared". It's because no one would actually make him take anything down and none of this would ever happen. </p>
<p>Some people critisized him and pointed out he prints a bunch of lies. That's not being censored. Why is he such a delicate little snowflake that he has to delete everything because someone critisized what he wrote? If what he wrote was true, he could sue his critiques for libel. Instead he throws a tantrum and deletes everything. WHY? It's not fucking rocket surgery to guess why. (Hint---it's not because the gestapo is going to disappear him. If that was the problem he has enough money to relocate to somewhere he was safe. But he won't because that's not an actual threat in his situation.)</p>
<p>I swear, you people just love to imagine you're so persecuted and so smart, when it's really all just a stupid, dangerous LARP.</p>
