    <strong>Are any IT guys here?</strong>
    <p><p>I have a feeling that the majority of IT people support the new normal as they perceive all of what is happening good for the society and progression of the world. I am not working in IT although I enjoy learning programming, cyber security and anything high tech. I am not against innovations. On the contrary I support new ideas that could solve perpetuating problems but I am very suspicious of things that are fiercly promoted or obstructed by media.</p>
<p>Generally speaking employees in IT are the least affected of this situation in terms of lifestyle or empoyment status. They worked in an office and still can work from home if needed. Business are still running and they never missed a payment, at least the majority I believe.</p>
<p>The whole hysteria didn't leave a negative mark on everyone. Some individuals got even benefit such as big market stores or online stores and transport companies. People who had positive to neutral economic profit are less inclined to contradict the measures.</p>
<p>Are any of you that were not influenced financially but still oppose this agenda? Or are we just a bunch of quaint conspiracy theorists that lost their jobs and / or miss their real social life?</p></p>

        <p>Computer programmer here. . . .</p>
<p>&rt;Are any of you that were not influenced financially but still oppose this agenda?</p>
<p>I oppose this whole nonsense. I want to be back in my office with my colleagues and being able to see faces. I have had limited contact with my co-workers, its all webex, zoom and very little face to face.</p>
<p>Yes, I have not been affected financially but that does not mean my job is 100% safe.</p>
<p>&rt;are we just a bunch of quaint conspiracy theorists that lost their jobs and / or miss their real social life?</p>
<p>Conspiracies cease being conspiracies when folks like Alex Jones, or David Icke who have been warning us for years about the very thing happening now is right in front of our faces. Suddenly now, their rantings, and theories aren't just crazy ramblings but facts. So, to answer your question, no, you are not.</p>

        <p>I left my job mid-2019 to start a tech company and have been working from home since then. </p>
<p>The pandemic made the work easier as everyone began spending more time online etc but I genuinely fucking hate the new normal and everything that goes with it. </p>
<p>Everyone around me that I knew from work before (Corporate IT) is the same - they all love it. Sit in bed on a laptop all day, do fuck all work, get paid, remaining anti-social IRL whilst posting to social media about how they are saving lives. The type of people you couldn't get to come for a beer after work on a Friday because they had to get home for a Rust server wipe.</p>
<p>I have close family members I can't see because they are brainwashed into thinking I'm an asymptomatic plague rat. I have friends I've lost because they've turned into lunatics. I have friends who are losing everything because the government wants their businesses shutdown.</p>
<p>I'd hope that a lot of IT guys would know who Aaron Swartz was and would understand the terrifying nature of information control &amp; censorship by governments and their corporate interests.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for the information takeover ever since he died. Looks like we are truly there now and it's fucking terrifying.</p>

        <p>Not IT but I do QA work for an AAA game developer that prides itself in remote working <em>(it's a unique trait of the company that we advertise on our homepage)</em>. My lifestyle didn't change at all. I feel like the past five years of my life set me up perfectly for 2020 and it has been relatively easy sailing all year.</p>
<p>The measures are insane and watching its' effects on the mental health of those around me has been wild. I have been extremely lucky.</p>
<p>My mom and dad do nothing but watch CNN for the first part of the evening, then pass out watching W channel movies. My dad used to be a successful high school football coach but with sports in Canada totally killed he basically has nothing to do so he sits around getting angry at Trump because orange man bad. My mom has expressed several times that she's depressed and also very obviously has nothing to do. She's big into photography but since nothing is happening, there's nothing to take pictures of.</p>
<p>Some of my gaming buddies became noticeably bitter and short tempered. Not getting as many kills as the other guy in Warzone resulted in a pair of friends not speaking to each other for upwards of a month. They won the match and it wasn't even like, eSports or anything, just a regular round.  Friendship over.</p>
<p>IRL friends fared slightly better but it was interesting to see how a lack of hockey on TV suddenly turned into buddies just grasping at straws to fill time. Sometimes you open up your phone and see a friend is playing the stock market. Another night you're up with the boys 'til 4am in someone's basement watching 90's Monster Trucks. One of my friends went to an anger management class because he was bored and felt more irritable than usual. My single friends have given up dating altogether and just binge on vidya all day. I guess I fall into this category too.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine is a shop manager for a large trailer repair company. Constantly has to deal with people just not giving a shit at work, phoning in sick because they're depressed, or dealing with addictions.</p>
<p>90% of women I talk to on a daily basis, got into porn or sex work of some kind. If they're not on OnlyFans, they're on SeekingArrangement or selling privately. On the inverse, a few of the chicks I was subbed to on OnlyFans added me out of boredom and we bullshit every few days about vidya or life or whatever - it's not like they have anything to do either.  The only woman I know who didn't get into porn, spends all day begging people to follow covid rules on social media and looks visibly exhausted in her insta stories because she's stuck in retail hell yelling at people for not following arrows on the floor.</p>
<p>It's bizarre and sometimes funny, but this can't reasonably continue.</p>

        <p>Yes. Work IT. My co-workers enjoy WFH but wish their kids could go to school/day care. I have to go on-site a lot for hands on things so it's crazy busy when I go in. Don't think they care much about advancing anything, they just like working from home, all are married with a kid or two. I live alone and miss socializing at the office tho there are a few perks to being home all the time.</p>

<p>OP: Yea, 20 years IT here, in all sorts of roles.  I'm damned sick of this nonsense and scamdemic.  I can see that this virus has been blown out of proportion.  I can read the journal articles and understand them since before I jumped into IT I spend a decade in applied Bioscience post college, where my focus of study was microbiology, emphasis in molecular biology and genetics.  I find it damned odd how so little influenza there is this season....</p>

        <p>No, because it's you cunts that's killed everyone I fucking care about this year...</p>
<p>All you needed to do is wear a mask, stay apart and keep your fucking OPINIONS to yourselves while the EXPERTS did what they needed to do for all of us...</p>
<p>But , you think this is a game. I would stomp on your skull given a split second</p>

        <p>I lost many people by cancer that's more dangerous than this flu and we didn't need mask for that.</p>
<p>OH yeah nobody cares about that anymore it's all about covid let's act like it's the most dangerous killer virus while it has a 99,5% survival rate.</p>
<p>Less people died by covid compared to non infectious diseases that caused more deaths</p>
<p>Show me proof it's a killer virus and it's not fake.</p>
<p>There's more evidence out there it's fake than evidence it's a killer virus that needs all these stupid laws.</p>
<p>It's not even about a virus it's about control and a virus is a great excuse.</p>
