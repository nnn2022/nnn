    <strong>For the first time, I'm actually getting a bit scared</strong>
    <p><p>The media are pushing the narrative that the unvaccinated are killing the vaccinated. It's so blatantly false and completely illogical but so many people would rather believe a complete falsehood than finally admit that The Science was wrong about something. What is scary is that a segment of these people are actually calling for forced vaccination or even the killing of the unvaccinated. Never in my life have I been threaten with death for anything, let alone making a medical decision.</p>
<p>I know the people saying this are maladapted social retards on Reddit but still... This needs to stop. This is getting way too ridiculous.</p>
<p>It's ok to be wrong. Just admit it: the vaccines do not work. And even if the impossible happened and new variants popped up that are more deadly than the original Covid-19 (mutations are never more deadly, just more transmissible), the vaccinated are just as responsible for that because they too can catch and spread Covid because, as I've stated previously, the vaccines do not work under any reasonable definition of a vaccine we would have used before 2019.</p>
<p>It's not ok to call for genocide because you're angry you got lied to by the great prophets of Scientism. Get a fucking grip.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you ever try something funny, I'm just letting you know right now that I won't go down without a fight. Back me into a corner and make sure I have nothing left to lose and find out what I can do.</p></p>

<p>British Columbia has 80% of 12+ (not just adults!) with one dose, closing in on 65% with two. We used to talk about herd immunity at 70%+, but that's silently disappeared from the news cycle.</p>
<p>Now it's all about the unvaxxed.</p>
<p>My province's top public health officer said recently that she's "not ready" to have unvaccinated guests at her home.</p>

        <p>If they’re worried about their neighbor giving them Covid (of which the vaccine SHOULD) protect them - but they are not worried about the origins of the virus, it’s all theater.  They are focusing on “unvaccinated variants” but we haven’t isolated if this came from a bat or a lab - who is to say another bat isn’t causing another more deadly variant?  They need someone to blame for their bad decision.</p>

        <p>It's absurd that they think unvaccinated people are causing problems... it makes no sense.  The vaccine was approved because the studies showed that after being vaccinated, people who caught covid had less severe symptoms.  They did not test to see if people were asymptomatic or how much they were transmitting it - and now reports are coming out that they transmit just as much as unvaccinated people.  (Seemed kind of silly to me that anyone ever thought it magically made  people with covid not transmit it to others... I mean, if you catch an infectious disease, you still spread it to others whether or not you've been vaccinated.  'I have the flu/chicken pox/measles, but don't worry, you can't catch it from me because I was vaccinated'.)</p>
<p>You said that mutated virusses don't become more deadly, just more transmittable.  I think that's incorrect.  The Spanish Flu of 1918 was just one annual mutation of the flu.  Certain flu years are more deadly than others.  MRSA is a bacteria (not a virus), but it became deadlier.  I think mutations can do just about anything.  The goal of a virus is to become less deadly and live in harmony with the host (because if the host dies, the virus dies too) - but virusses sometimes mutate badly.</p>

        <p>With utmost respect, you lost me at MRSA. Viruses and bacteria are very very different things. And if we entertain your apples and oranges statement, MRSA became more RESISTANT, because of antibiotic resistance. So by that logic, technically, the more you’re throwing at the virus ( antibiotics, vaccines, etc) the more likely it will then mutate faster than it would if left to be fought by the immune system naturally.</p>

        <p>Guy above me said mrsa - I agree with it become more resistant to anti-biotics, but if you get mrsa and don’t treat it, you’re chance of death in 1990 vs now is exactly the same. </p>
<p>I could see how it being more resistant makes it more deadlier though, agree there.</p>

        <p>I honestly feel like I'm subconsciously waiting for the tptb to ADMIT the vaccine is nowhere near as effective, doesn't prevent the spread or infection, (and may even make the infection worse via ADE), and also carries a much higher risk of severe adverse events than anticipated, as such the vaccination program will be made redundant. Is that a realy wishful thinking?</p>

        <p>I don't give a fuck about their marketing claims. When they said Pfizer was 95% effective, it just meant that 0,07% of the group with the vax caught Covid, compared to 0,74% of those without the vax. In reality, both have less than 1% chance of catching it (and we're talking about a virus with a 99,8% survival rate) SO WHO GIVES A FUCK?! </p>
<p>Also, you must not be aware that PCR tests just got recalled by the FDA because they're unable to tell the difference between Covid-19 and Influenza. So any study done using a PCR test is now meaningless.</p>

        <p>How do they know how effective it is if alot of people are asymptomatic but still have the virus? They dont get tested so your numbers are skewed. Who knows how many people had minor symptoms and said fuck it i have the vaxx im good. They would need to test everyone once a week for atleast a month before i ever believe anything over 50% efficiency</p>
