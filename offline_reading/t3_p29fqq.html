    <strong>My parents have figured out everything, but they still got the vaccine and keep pressuring me to get mine to "get my life back" and have no stress anymore</strong>
    <p><p>LONGER POST WARNING</p>
<p>TLDR My parents know that everything is a circus, but they just got vaccinated to keep "living their lifes stress free" and they keep making me do it as well. </p>
<p>They are a special kind of people. They both figured everything out quickly about this "pandemic". Hell, last year when I still believed this was real I tried arguing with them that it is not how they think.</p>
<p>Anyway, fast forward to this year, after the vaccines came in my country too, they went to get them. Why? Not because they believe in it or because they are scared of Covid. But because they want their lives back. They motivated their decision saying that they reached an age when they just want to travel and see the world and If this is what they have to do for it to end, they will. And they did it.</p>
<p>They had no severe side effects, except my mom who felt like the train hit her the first day after the first dose (AstraZeneca) but after, they seem to be okay. They got it in March. Now they keep asking me if I don't want to get it and every time I answered that I would rather live in the mountains than get the vaccine. They say I only say this because I am not forced to get it. And now every day they show me what's happening in France and Italy and ask me "how long are you going to keep up fooling around, look what's happening, this is the current state of society". I told them all the reasons I refused and they agreed with all of them, however they say that despite me being right about everything, it's being forced by the government and we can't fight it. I say "of course we can, if everyone, or at least the majority refuses it, they will back off". And they just laughed. They say this never happens and sooner or later everyone will get vaccinated because otherwise you won't be able to participate in society anymore.</p>
<p>Long story short, their reasoning is that you can't fight the government and you must obey in order to live peacefully. I asked my dad what would he have done in 1946 when the communists took over in my country and he replied that he would have shot them and die fighting rather than live 50 years in a dictatorship. I simply replied "no, you wouldn't have done any of this". Of course he got annoyed, said how do I know better than him what he would've done.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what I have to deal with, every day they keep asking me what I will do if I can't go to the gym, to the restaurant, to the mall if I don't get vaccinated, how long will I make this dumb resistance, what's my limit and where do I cross the line.</p></p>

        <p>It's hard to admit it, but we all have our breaking points. I think mine will be if they start transporting unvaxxed people off to camps, as we know from history that ends really, really, badly.</p>
<p>But, I still have a some optimism that:-</p>
<p>1)  vaccine mandates can be challenged in court under the Nuremberg code.</p>
<p>2)  more and more people are waking up to the serious adverse reactions and death that are much more common than mainstream media admit, especially when it happens to someone young or someone they know.</p>
<p>3) more and more people see around them that the vaccines are basically useless at preventing spread or illness.</p>

        <p>My parents are still holding out and very sceptical of the vaccines but I suspect will relent in the end as they are over 60 and nearly everyone they know has taken the vaxx. All complained about side effects too.
But I have absolutely no intention of getting the vaccine and may only consider it if and when Novavax arrives, after I've seen how it goes for others.</p>

        <p>Man 🤡 🌎 is alive and well in the most unexpected places. My parents spent years hyper focusing on the Biblical end times, but now the shot "definitely isn't" the mark of the beast and everything will go back to "normal" anytime now. Former conspiracy theories come to pass regularly these days and the people that raised me respond by burying their heads and tuning it out.</p>
<p>As for you friend, you must never give in, never falter from the path you've chosen. It has become clear the coming days will see families turn against each other, friends torn apart. Stay the course, the days will continue to get darker, but know that you and I are not alone. But also make sure you have a plan, if it comes down to no work/money/food/water, be ready to stick to your guns and accept the very real consequences.</p>
