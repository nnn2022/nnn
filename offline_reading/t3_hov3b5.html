        <p>And yet, if you read the full story, it makes even less sense given that it wasn't his employees who were complaining or who reported him. It was customers. </p>
<p>He claimed his employees did not want to wear the masks either so it wasn't as if he was forcing them into "unsafe working conditions". He felt it was unsafe for them to be wearing masks for their entire shifts and they supposedly agreed. </p>
<p>That last sentence in the article really drives home the absurdity of these measures: </p>
<p>"Although I hope we do not have further situations of noncompliance, we will continue to close down any business that does not feel it shares responsibility to keep our entire county safe from COVID-19."</p>
<p>Since when does a small business owner have a responsibility to keep an entire county safe from anything? People need to asses their own risk, just like they always did. Don't want to be served by someone without a mask on? Don't eat at that restaurant. It's that simple.</p>

        <p>Exactly!
The problem is that the majority are scared so much, they're eradicating those who are not scared of just Covid.</p>
<p>I so wish I could shop at a place that doesn't require masks, but most all places need to follow the majority. </p>
<p>We can't choose who to give our business to now.</p>

        <p>There is no longer any such thing as choice or personal risk assessment in the "new normal."</p>
<p>You are now responsible for keeping your entire county, city, state, and country from imminent death.</p>
<p>What kind of monster would you be if you didn't save them? Because there is certainly nothing monstrous about publicly shaming people for making their own choices, destroying their livelihoods and forcing their staff into unemployment, right?</p>

        <p>I for one will only go to no-mask stores and restaurants.</p>
<p>This is a battle of government against independent businesses. It's not my battle.</p>
<p>So long as I can get groceries and the occasional pints of motor oil, I'll be fine. I don't need to spend money to survive; but they need me to spend money for them to survive.</p>

        <p>Most people here will tell you to support local small businesses. I believe that's only true if they provide a valuable product or service. You shouldn't have blindly support one just because. A business that doesn't give a hoot if I wear a mask or not, even if they have a sign out front, is one that's valuable to me. It's a privilege for them to get my money, if they want it so bad, show me.</p>

        <p>The owner is a Trump supporter? I'm shocked.</p>
<p>Why would the media ever want to portray people who oppose these lockdowns and restrictions as ignorant, science denying, Trump supporters? Surely there is no agenda there. And surely there can't be any other kind of person who might oppose these restrictions. No such thing.</p>
<p>LMAO. This is ridiculously transparent.</p>
<p>By the way, I finally had my first experience with such a business owner here in L.A.</p>
<p>I went to a cafe today in an area of Los Angeles that is primarily Asian (mostly Chinese owned businesses and residents). The owner who served me and prepared my food and drink was not wearing a mask or gloves. Everyone seated inside (dining in is still not officially sanctioned here btw) was not wearing one either. I sat outside because it was hot as hell indoors, but I can tell you that this is the first time I have seen anything remotely like this in L.A. County. People just did not give a shit.</p>
<p>The owner was breaking all kinds of laws and by some miracle has not been shut down yet. I'm guessing because his clientele is not made up of WFH American Karens with nothing better to do than ruin a business. He is an immigrant and so is most of his clientele. I'm sure they have lived through far more bullshit than a virus. At least that was the attitude I sensed from them.</p>
<p>I'm sure the word will eventually get out about him, but he doesn't seem remotely concerned.</p>

        <p>I hate mask laws, but if you <em>have</em> to enforce them I can see it in grocery stores.  Or doctor's offices.  Or any place where people <em>have</em> to go just to live.</p>
<p>But a restaurant is not one of those places.  A restaurant is a luxury.  You don't dine out because it's the only way you can eat, you dine out because you want to.  For this reason mask laws should absolutely <em>not</em> be enforced in restaurants.  It should be up to the business owner to decide if they want to require their employees to wear masks.  Not to mention the fact that it's absolutely ludicrous and nonsensical: nobody is required to wear a mask when they're seated in restaurants.  A couple hundred customers might come through a restaurant in a given day, all of them breathing openly and potentially exhaling viral particles and that's okay, but a dozen or so employees working there is a threat?  It's safety theater.  And if someone is truly that afraid of the virus that they need these performances to feel safe they can choose to not go out to a restaurant.</p>
