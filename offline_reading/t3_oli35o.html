    <strong>COVID projections back in early 2020</strong>
    <p><p>On 03/11/2020, when the COVID scares began taking root I started a spreadsheet of 'Projected' cases and 'Actual' cases. At this time, I was completely 'under the spell' so to speak. Until 04/20/2020, it seemed the 'Actual' cases and 'Projected' cases were fairly accurate taking into consideration that we should experience a growth rate of 2X every 4 days. Were we successful in 'flattening the curve'? Or was it all propaganda? I stopped updating the spreadsheet 04/23/2020 as seen in the spreadsheet but according to the projections, the entire population could have been infected by 05/25/2020 - obviously this wasn't the case.   </p>
