    <strong>My college is run by fascistic dictators: a warning to future students</strong>
    <p><p>It's me again. It's been quite a while since I've posted here (at least with this account), but I think this most recent update warrants another post. As always, I'm avoiding personal details since I don't want Notre Dame to kick me out — and based on these new policies, they have no qualms whatsoever about removing students for minor offenses.</p>
<p>Just a heads up, this will be a very long post. But this is the only community where I really feel comfortable posting all of this, and I feel it is necessary to do so, if nothing else to serve as a warning for future students. And perhaps others can come forward with their own experiences.</p>
<p>Source material: <a href="https://dulac.nd.edu/notre-dame-compact/">Notre Dame Compact: COVID-19 Addendum</a></p>
<p>Before I get going, I guess I will give credit where credit is due: this is the first time all the rules have been located in one location, and is the least vague they have been since this entire thing started. It makes it much easier to criticize them.</p>
<p>Also, a few had suggested legal action in the previous post. While legal action <em>might</em> work, there are not many loopholes left in these new rules, and Notre Dame has made it clear that any rule changes apply to all current students. They have also stated that "The University operates under different policies, procedures and standards, and therefore it is not necessarily bound by the findings of a court of law." Pretty typical for most private universities, but worrying nonetheless (keep in mind this is buried pretty deep in their standards, so most people don't even know about it).</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Administrative Process</strong></p>
<p>This section lays out the administrative end of things — specifically in the area of COVID tests and the punishment for missing them. This semester, we are required to get weekly tests (including for off-campus students), in addition to random surveillance.</p>
<p>In 2020, Notre Dame created the COVID-19 Response Unit (CRU), which is a combination of medical personnel and random people who simply walk around calling out violations. If the CRU reports a missed test, you immediately get a formal warning which remains on record for the semester, and your hall rector also gets a copy.</p>
<p>A second missed test puts you on "COVID probation," and requires a meeting with the Office of Community Standards (OCS). If you miss a test again while on probation, and the OCS believes the violation to be sufficiently egregious, you are subject to "COVID dismissal," which is almost the same as expulsion, with the caveat that you can reapply in the fall.</p>
<p>Similar processes apply for those who violate any of the other rules. The CRU will report violations to the OCS, and the OCS decides if it is severe enough to put on record.</p>
<p>Most worrying of all is the following statement:</p>
<p>&rt;There is no right to a formal hearing at any stage of the Administrative Process. </p>
<p>In other words, students do not have any rights. This should be illegal, but private universities can do basically anything they want. </p>
<p>I'd also like to talk about the increased testing. This will seriously inflate infection numbers, because they are reported anonymously. If a student gets a positive test, they have to go into quarantine and test daily for two weeks, thus resulting in up to 14 positive tests reported for a single student. I also have connections in the medical field, and with this massive surge in testing, they will be even more overburdened than they already are — at this point they are almost incapable of keeping up just with the weekly tests from our athletes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Campus Compact (i.e., the rules)</strong></p>
<p>Before we even get into the rules, there's this lovely statement:</p>
<p>&rt;I understand that I must follow all of the University’s health and safety rules for as long as they remain in effect, even if I have previously contracted COVID-19 or if I have been vaccinated. I understand that this is critical for my own protection as well as that of others in this community. </p>
<p>I won't break down every single rule; many of them have been discussed endlessly already. But, there are a handful worth pointing out.</p>
<p>First, the university has banned off-campus gatherings over 10 people, and told students not to go to places where local/state/federal guidelines are not strictly followed. This rule applies to workplaces, restaurants, stores, and even church. Yes, they are actually trying to control students off campus. And they enforce this thanks to the fact that they have made a form where students can report each other. They claim to want to foster community, <em>but do the exact opposite</em>.</p>
<p>Students are also to remain in the local area unless <em>given permission</em> by university health services to travel. Again, massive overreach.</p>
<p>They have also included a very short section about residence halls, dining halls, and other community buildings. This section is incredibly vague — which leaves the CRU and OCS a ton of leeway when reporting and punishing students. This will absolutely be abused, like many of the other rules.</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>I won't bore you with repetition from previous posts. But please, incoming students, be aware of how colleges are right now. Unless you absolutely need the degree for your subject, or you're going to a school that isn't turning into an authoritarian dystopia, don't go to college.</p>
<p>I also encourage students currently in college to make posts like these. Spread the word and help us fight what is happening right now.</p></p>

        <p>Liberal arts colleges indoctrinate students into becoming liberals. </p>
<p>Also, how many teachers and professors are staunch liberals? I’d be willing to be a large majority of them are. The cycle continues. You hear about them pushing their political opinions onto their students every day.</p>

<p>It sounds like they're treating you like you're in prison where they can "write you up" on trumped up charges with no due process. And by the way, tuition at 76.8 thousand USD, you can get more bang for your buck at a community college, then transfer to a not-so-expensive college or university.</p>

<p>I just feel so bad for you guys. College should be the best years of your life and they took that away from you. For what? So they could virtue signal. That’s it. None of this stuff makes ANY sense from a public health perspective.</p>
<p>I think maybe the college students should start a nationwide protest. Even if it’s only 5-10 percent of students that would at least get their attention. No other generation would have put up with this crap. Not in a million years.</p>

        <p>Dude I feel your pain. I go to UMass Amherst, and the policies there are just as bad. Testing is mandatory twice weekly. I'm fairly sure that if you skip testing you can be denied access to the dining hall, so I can't get around it if I wish to eat. Masks must be worn at all time, including just walking down the sidewalk. Every moment of my day is impacted by the health administration, beginning in the morning when I have to fill a "symptom checklist". I am beginning to think that the officials are enjoying their newfound importance too much.</p>

        <p>Pretty much identical here. Though instead of cutting off dining hall access they just kick us out lol.</p>
<p>Honestly I’d be okay with the dining hall thing. I barely eat, and when I do it’s usually either in my dorm or off campus. Dining halls have been a joke anyway because apparently covid means all the food must be terrible and you have to eat outside.</p>

        <p>I have literally encountered the same issue at my college. It is what they call medical tyranny.. I just don’t get it, as if college wasn’t hard enough now we have to oblige by this nonsense. I thought anyway college students shouldn’t be a major concern since we aren’t considered a “vulnerable” portion of the population. I am absolutely EXHAUSTED of experiencing this level of bs.. &amp; then the most offensive part is that they send emails constantly and questionnaires asking us how we feel about the semester and how our mental health is..?? Like um idk let’s start by considering the fact that I’m still paying FULL tuition prices and basically teaching myself EVERYTHING on top of everything else that has been stated so yeah, just peachy 🙃</p>

        <p>I totally agree, the state college I go to is just as bad. I actually got kicked off of campus for visiting my parents for a couple days during the semester and was threatened with a “judicial process” and disciplinary action if I didn’t move out immediately. And this spring they’re getting even more strict, telling us we need to wear masks outside even when nobody is around, and saying that we can’t visit friends/family off campus without a mask, and even limiting off-campus gatherings to 2-4 people. I regret giving any money to my university and would be transferring if I wasn’t a senior.</p>

        <p>No I’m not surprised. Unfortunately it’s the best physics school in the state and most of my scholarship money required in-state education.</p>
<p>Prior to covid I had hoped to just stay under the social radar and focus on work and academics. I’m not a partier, nor a catholic (though I have dated one — what a terrible time). However after covid it’s difficult to do much of anything and I wish I had just picked another school, even if that meant a slightly less prestigious degree.</p>

        <p>Baylor did the same.</p>
<p><em>Beginning Monday, Jan. 18, 2021, all Baylor students are required to complete a COVID 19 test weekly at an on-campus testing facility. ....</em></p>
<p><em>Our goal is to make weekly testing as easy and convenient as possible for students with regular appointments and convenient testing locations. Each student will be pre-assigned a weekly testing day, time and location so testing can become a simple part of your everyday routine. If the pre-assigned time does not work for your schedule due to a class or work conflict, you will need to select a new time by 8 a.m. Monday, Jan. 18. You will receive a follow-up email with your testing assignment tomorrow morning.....</em></p>
<p><em>If you miss your assigned testing appointment for the week, you do not need to reschedule and can walk-in for an appointment at your designated testing location. All make-up appointments must be completed within the same week. Please note that missing your assigned testing appointment for a week may result in a “Failure to Test” charge under the Student Conduct Code as outlined below....</em></p>
<p><em>In appreciation for each week of testing, you will receive a $3 food voucher to local restaurants and be entered in a drawing for end-of-semester prizes, including $5,000 tuition, $3,000 housing credit and a $1,500 bookstore credit.</em></p>
<p><em>Provided that our COVID-19 case numbers are low and testing compliance is more than 95 percent, we are planning to provide students a "wellness day" in which there will be no classes on Tuesday, March 9.....</em></p>
<p><em>After two instances of failing to complete a weekly test, you will not be allowed to participate in University or student organization activities (All University SING, athletic events, student organization events, campus recreation sports, access to the Student Life Center for recreation, etc.). After missing three testing appointments, your WIFI access will be disabled for the remainder of the semester. After four instances of failing to complete a weekly test, you will be referred to Student Conduct Administration for disciplinary action. Disciplinary action will include a failure to comply charge, and sanctions may include a range of options up to and including suspension.</em></p>

        <p>Curious, is there an "underground" or a "resistance" among the student body? I imagine there are places that you college kids go to get around the rules? What are students doing to live normal lives?</p>

        <p>When this initially happened, there were quite a few students who were calling for President Jenkins to resign. However, most of these people were saying that because they wanted more restrictions, not less.</p>
<p>There are definitely some of us who want to end all of this. Usually I see them later at night when hall staff aren’t around. I would love to find a way to unite this group, but I know Notre Dame will shut it down if they ever find out, and I have no clue if I’d even be able to manage such a thing considering my major and my job.</p>
<p>Right now, the best most of us can hope for is socializing outdoors. It’s not ideal in the cold but there really aren’t many spaces that allow groups. I’m sure some people also meet off campus but there have been several instances just in the past couple months of people getting in pretty big trouble for things like that.</p>

        <p>Yes, of course, students wanting it to be more strict.</p>
<p>Keep your ear to the ground. I think people will probably just WANT TO HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE enough that they will find ways. Tricky that your job/major might preclude it.</p>
<p>Not to suggest anything, um, illegal, but students that have experience with let's say personal pharmacology (drugs) might be more inclined by nature to be rule breakers, and so might be finding ways to meet up.</p>
