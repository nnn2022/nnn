    <strong>"I can be like you any day I want, but you can never be like me." Why society is peer pressuring others to take the vaccine is like pressuring people to lose their virginity.</strong>
    <p><p>I work with teens for a living, as you can probably guess, peer pressure has always been rampant.  Enter 2020 with all things social justice and covid virtue signaling, our students have expressed social anxiety to feel pressured to do things they do not want to do.</p>
<p>Things like posting/sharing social justice movement slogans and or colors.</p>
<p>Pressure to get a shot they have reservations for.</p>
<p>Much of what we've done in this past year was to protect "grandma's" around the world and little has been done about supporting our teens, very little.</p>
<p>I reminded them that they can choice when to have sex, never feel like they have to.</p>
<p>Same goes with the shot, never feel pressured to do it. Cause once you take that shot, you can never go back.</p></p>

        <p>I am older [gen x] and disgusted most of the boomer generation is sacrificing the young now on a new level. Young people are at low risk from Covid. Their lives and health should mean more. I never had children but used to be in the old days, older people cared about the young. There's too many selfish narcissists now.</p>
