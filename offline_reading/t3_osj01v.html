    <strong>You are all wrong. Israel's data proves nothing about vaccine efficacy.</strong>
    <p><p>It does prevent transmission, and Israel's data doesn't refute that.</p>
<p>Lmao. Anyway to finally refute Israel's data once and for all</p>
<p>AFAIK, Israel's data from their mass testing was showing a 94% reduction in asymptomatic infection in it's population following vaccination way back in February/March (with the Pfizer vaccine) - which was also in a similar trend in UK's testing, although the UK had a lower number of data points. This has dropped to around 40% at the most conservative estimate with the Delta variant - basically indicating that in case studies among vaccinated populations, the vaccine <em>is</em> preventing infection in people (otherwise, there wouldn't have been a change in asymptomatic infection rate numbers). You don't see this in our local data because we're not mass testing at the level of Israel, so our asymptomatic cases are only those detected through contact tracing and not the actual numbers really out there.</p>
<p>The other part is that if the vaccinated people get infected, there's a 93% chance they won't require hospitalisation</p>
<p>Credit to u/syanda for articulating effectively what I've always thought was that survivor's bias bullshit you call data.</p></p>

        <p>That efficacy number will just keep dropping as more vaccinated people are exposed. Itâ€™s easy to make up numbers before doing any real studies. Remember, the people taking the vaccines are the studies and we do not have the results yet.</p>

        <p>&rt; way back in February/March</p>
<p>Here's the key. Same with the UK. If you look at plenty of european nations during the same time period, you will see similar reduction rates in infection <em>without</em> the same vaccination percentage.</p>
<p>The real test comes now, where 80/90% of the population is vaccinated. And the numbers, sadly, don't lie:</p>
<p>https://i.redd.it/qhveqxdg4kb71.jpg</p>
<p>These are overall infections, and vaccinated/unvaccinated ratio. The disturbing pattern you see here leaves pretty much no doubt around if the vaccine is sterilizing or not: take 100 people, in any age range, say 90 are vaccinated and 10 are not. You see 9 infections in the vaccinated, and 1 in the unvaccinated. Exactly the same ratio. The image above even saves you the trouble of calculating the relative ratios.</p>
<p>&rt; The other part is that if the vaccinated people get infected, there's a 93% chance they won't require hospitalisation</p>
<p>This still stands, for now. If you ask me, it should mean "pandemic's done, back to 2019", since everyone who's at risk has been offered a vaccine and the vaccine is non sterilizing. Seems like governments all over the world are not of the same opinion.</p>

<p>Wow, a huge drop in effectiveness proves it's working?  That's some Olympic caliber mental gymnastics.</p>
<p>You do realize that drop means people are getting infected, right?  That means it isn't working.  It also means that the high % effectiveness in the past was probably due to random chance.  This is further supported by the abysmally low ARR.</p>
<p>&rt;
The other part is that if the vaccinated people get infected, there's a 93% chance they won't require hospitalisation</p>
<p>Sounds good, except 98% of people didn't require hospitalization before the vaccines hit the market.
Even the most dire figure was only 5% had severe Covid.</p>
<p>Keep going for that gold, though!</p>
