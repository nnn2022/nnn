    <strong>New Mexico: 4 or more Sick People in Your Store &amp; Everyone gets a Two Week Vacation!</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.env.nm.gov/rapid-response-data/</p>
<p>&rt;10. Which businesses will close for two weeks once they reach four or more rapid responses in 14 
calendar days?
Any “food and drink establishment,” “place of lodging,” “retail space,” or “essential business” (other 
than those which meet the definition of a healthcare operation, utility, or media service) in which 
members of the public regularly visit, must immediately close for 14 days if there are four or more 
rapid responses within the last 14 days. These establishments are defined in the Nov. 13, 2020 
public health order.
When there are four or more rapid responses at a location that meet the criteria for inclusion on the 
Watchlist (see question 3) within 14 calendar days, the New Mexico Environment Department will 
refer the establishment to the Department of Health, which will evaluate and make the decision on 
establishment closure. An “essential business” may be permitted to continue operating if the 
Department of Health, after consultation with the Environment Department, determines that the 
business is a necessary provider of goods or services within a community</p></p>
