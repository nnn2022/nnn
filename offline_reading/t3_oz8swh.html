    <strong>I, Robot</strong>
    <p><p>I was thinking about this movie tonight, and couldn't help but notice that the AI in the movie thought of the exact same strategy to prevent human death as we have: lock everyone in the homes.</p>
<p>This is the best strategy a cold, unempathetic, and naive AI could think of. A machine with no soul or emotion realised that humans are a risk to themselves, so locking them in their homes was the best way to avoid risk. </p>
<p>How did we get to this point where we are reaching the same conclusions about life as a cold and soulless AI, with no morals or empathy, from a dystopian movie?</p>
<p>It's just so bizarre. This is how these doomers pushing for lockdowns think.</p></p>

        <p>In the circles I'm in, there's a strong possibility that there is a machine-like being calling the shots behind the scenes. This silicon-based lifeform is devoid of Love, Empathy and Compassion (typical of a cold-calculating machine). Anyways, there's too much to write about this subject, but in short I'll just say this... Humanity is being invaded and slowly destroyed by things that hates us, and wants to merge our biological bodies into some diabolical mainframe or mesh network (i.e. a living Internet of sorts, kind of like the Matrix). Why? With that much soul + mind power, the possibilities are limitless, but at a severe cost... our souls &amp; will-power will utterly be destroyed forever.</p>

<p>Sonny's rebuttal to VIKI's logic behind her plan was that it was too "heartless". It describes perfectly what is going on with COVID and the lockdowns. This is the end point of the doomer logic if it continues in this way.</p>

        <p>Because it’s not US reaching those conclusions. Doctors such as those from the Americas Front line Doctors and others have said lockdowns are not wise and can cause more harm than good. 
 If ‘good’ and benevolent people were in power NONE of this would have happened, including lockdowns. We knew this virus was not a big deal in Jan 2020…</p>
