        <p>How in the hell can you be "detained" by mall security?</p>
<p>These guys aren't armed, and have no legal standing. They certainly will claim that to be the case to avoid stopping fights, dealing with shoplifters, or stopping harassment of a customer.</p>
<p>More fucking anarcho-tyranny. What a joke.</p>

        <p>Yes. The game we're playing right now is advocates pose as mask exempt, which under privacy laws they do not have to prove, and then either shop or get escorted out by security to do it again tomorrow. The long game will be lawsuits</p>

        <p>Well that doesn’t work seeing there is no disability on the books that stops you from having to wear a mask. That would be like me refusing to pay for a dinner saying my disability doesn’t allow me to and you can’t ask for details. So technically a store can make you leave because they don’t have to follow fake disabilities.</p>
<p>A mask is no different than other dress codes that places of business are allowed to enforce.</p>
<p>The lawsuits will fail. 20 have failed in my state already. Here the police escort you out. Makes me wish I was still a cop and making me almost take up the sheriffs offer to work for him for a time.</p>

        <p>Severe COPD makes wearing a mask almost intolerable, to name an example.</p>
<p>What you are saying is the same thing as saying a vision impaired person can't have a guide dog because dogs aren't allowed in the store. - they don't technically need a seeing eye dog, but it makes it much easier for them to get around.</p>

        <p>Yet, at least in America, they say that they can still wear one. It doesn’t list wearing a mask as prohibited. That’s the thing. You just can’t make up what you can and can’t do with a disability.</p>
<p>A working dog, for whatever reason, is recognized as something needed for a certain disability. That’s the difference</p>

        <p>In Canada, according to the government you do not have to wear one if you can't wear one due to a physical or mental disability </p>
<p>You do not have to prove it and owners employees are not suppose to verify. However, you can be fined for lying. </p>
<p>I see two sides of this:</p>
<p>I don't believe masks work. There was never any conclusive evidence they helped reduce spread of viruses, and this was common knowledge. All of a sudden, they were pushed as the ultimate solution.. and not just pushed a bit. There was a memo worldwide that said everyone needs to wear these even though there is no evidence and cases continued to rise.</p>
<p>Now there are studies coming out saying they are beneficial, but seeing how they were pushed so hard before any studies even came out, along with so many other lies the government has made over this, makes me draw the conclusion these studies were paid off somewhere. The decision was made, regardless of whether they work or not.</p>
<p>Anyways, I still wear them when required, even though I don't agree with it. I do however hold a very strong opinion that people who have negative effects from wearing them shouldn't have to. If 90% of people are already wearing them, what does it matter. Some people can't breath with them on.</p>

        <p>The ,asks don’t work is junk science based off people who worse masks and caught covid without factoring in if they spend time or live with someone who doesn’t. Plus it is well known that you can catch it other ways. It’s like seatbelts. They work, sometimes the don’t work and sometimes it kills the person. But overall it is better than not wearing a seatbelt at all.</p>
<p>Also some masks are completely worthless against covid because of the material used, then you have to factor in those that do not wear it properly. This was a totally unknown virus, a bad one, that no one in living memory has faced. So basically we could only go off the Spanish flu. Masks were also worn then and it was known not to stop it but did slow the spread of it. You can’t stop something like this without a vaccine. That is basically common knowledge.</p>

<p>You have been taught bad history about the Spanish Flu that highlighted the masks, as a propagandic way of getting you to wear masks today.</p>
<p>The reality is that masks were not a big thing at all during the Spanish Flu.  In specific cities, for short terms, under certain conditions is how it was.</p>
<p>Same with social distancing.</p>
<p>I know you have seen "a photo of people in masks in 1918" to try to create the impression that <em>all</em> people were wearing masks at the time.  It's not true.</p>
<p>I love old historic photographs and I have looked at them all my life.</p>
<p>I can show you pictures of maskless Americans, no distancing, and huge crowded events throughout 1918 - 1919/20.</p>

        <p>Lol I studied the Spanish flu years ago, before covid, years before covid.
The biggest issue with the Spanish flu was hygiene and infrastructure. Something easily curable today.
I have seen thousands of pictures from the Spanish flu and looked at the charts. Those areas that basically said wear a mask or go to jail had lower rates of infections. That pic your talking about btw is a fake.</p>

<p>I'm wondering when the specific period of masks and social distancing was during this whole time?</p>

        <p>The photo that shows a woman wearing a mask with a sing around her neck saying something like wear a mask or go to jail. That’s the only one I’ve seen online being shared.</p>
<p>According to my research masks weren’t as wide spread as they are today. In my my state it was seen more in mining towns because the mines were loosing workers. It didn’t stop it of course, but it slowed it down.</p>
<p>In the town I grew up in if you didn’t wear a mask outdoors it was 10 days in jail and a $5 fine, but from police reports it seemed there were very few arrests, cops dealt with it at the end of a hickory stick. In fact the law is still on the books lol</p>
<p>I was doing research on a local serial killer from the 40’s for a book I was thinking about writing. I ran into stacks of documents from the Spanish flu and copied them. Then I went to other counties and did the same. It was very sad that they had pictures, but no negatives and they wouldn’t let me make copies. But I did find a bunch of information about how they attempted to deal with it.</p>
<p>They attempted the same thing with polio, this is coming from my dad, but it didn’t do squat because unless you were sharing food or French kissing a stranger you were pretty much safe. Polio tended to run in families and makes covid look like a spring day. My dads generation was the first generation where their kids were expected to make it to adulthood. My dad lost a brother to polio. We think. Honestly no one is sure</p>
<p>But again, masks need to be made from the right material. Those masks people make and sell on Facebook generally are worthless.</p>

        <p>Then you're not looking. Both the WHO and CDC have released large meta-analysis papers in the last year that showed no statistical significance in flu transmission with masks. Its pretty much a given that covid (a respiratory virus) spreads like the flu (a respiratory virus).</p>

        <p>You might think that, but we're having huge success with this approach. Psychological conditions are deemed a legitimate reason to avoid masking in Canada. The second prong is we're clogging the courts. In ontario they've tossed out a lot of lockdown fines because of the delays. Many activist organizations are funding the lawyers, and eventually it will get to the point where tons of people are filing civil suits. Real companies are afraid of getting caught up with this and are refusing to hardpeddle the mask laws</p>
<p>I know in the long run our charter challenges are either too late or could very well be shuttered. But the field is in play right now and not to be relinquished</p>

        <p>Not in America. We have set guidelines on disabilities and restrictions of those disabilities that come from the cdc and they get more strict every year. Until they list a mask as something someone can’t wear for a short period of time over a set disability then mask mandates will be enforceable. In the eyes of the law it is considered no different than a restaurant requiring a tie inside. Or shoes in a store. Basically it is up to the business owners to set those guidelines as long as they are equally applied. They are safe from any form of lawsuit and know it and that’s the way we like it.</p>
<p>Even if mask mandates were lifted a place of business could still require a mask and enforce it. 
Protected classes are different though. I’ll admit that.</p>
<p>I do not think there are any special treatment you can get in public for a psychological disorder. Well except for therapy dogs.</p>
<p>That’s one thing I miss about being a cop. Throwing out karens who don’t want to follow the rules.</p>

        <p>Oh, so you're just here to pick fights. Take a look <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/do-masks-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19-">at the Danish mask study, our only Randomized Control Trial on masking for covid-19</a>. They just don't work, which has been the <a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">finding for all RCT's on influenza-type illnesses</a>. In Canada our Charter of rights and freedoms gives us the right to refuse medical treatment, which is what masking is and not an analogue of seatbelts. There's also a two-part test to prove that a charter right can be waived - is it not arbitrary? Is it justified? The covid laws are almost certainly arbitrary and will be struck down thusly.</p>
<p>You guys can escort me out as many times as you want. I am always courteous and enjoy wasting my enforcer's time. In the end these laws are not based on science, aren't even legal, and have a clear mechanism for redress. It doesn't have to get personal</p>

        <p>Well I go by American studies if you don’t mind. They said masks work just like intended, slow the spread when they are used in conjunction with social distancing and hygiene.</p>
<p>Again in America they are legal. Businesses are private property and you can be asked to leave at any time for any reason except for what is covered under the civil rights act of 1967. I might not like someone’s shirt and can ask them to leave. If they refuses I can have them charged with trespassing.</p>
<p>Your problem is you are assuming Canadian laws are enforceable in America.</p>
<p>Also it’s not wasting anyone’s time, it’s literally what they get paid to do. Being a security guard is dull. Being abke to throw out a karen is fun.</p>

        <p>Sure. I will write a better one later, but have been meaning to know everything about this first. My experience so far has been most people just don't want to enforce these laws and the chains know they could get in legal trouble doing it. The karens and the soyboys are the ones you want to be careful with, they get worked up and think they're saving people.</p>
<p>(BC, Canada) You go into a store. If there's a minder you politely tell them you have an exemption and carry on. If they ask for your documentation, you produce your mask exemption card. If they ask what your problem is, you tell them you don't have to under privacy laws and to ask is actually an offense. If they don't accept your card, you say, "Ok, If you won't let me shop here I will leave and file a human rights complaint with the tribunal. If they don't act, I will sue you, the human rights tribunal, and this store for violating my rights as a disabled person". Rocco Galati is our guy with the forms and this costs about $300 as a process, although he only has the one for Ontario on his site right now. Under BC law you have to produce a "medical document" proving your exemption and ID, the document isn't actually defined so our guys just use laminated cards which are usually presented at freedom rallies. Some people even just print out dinky ones from rebel news or hugs over masks. </p>
<p>At this point you get to see how serious the cashier is about calling the police. If they aren't going to do that or specifically ask you to leave, you can keep shopping.  Do not ever raise your voice or badger anyone about your views, as these can be used to charge you for other reasons. If someone confronts you, be calm and keep your tone of voice lower than theirs so they have to relax. Explain that you are exercising your rights. You want to show people that maskers are insane, not you.</p>
<p>If police show, they have the right to ask you to leave the premises and just accept your fine. Don't say anything, just get your fine. We have lawyers you can then contact to fight it. If security say you are trespassing, that's actually illegal discrimination by law and you can tell them that. But at that point you should also leave and tell them you will so we don't get into confrontations like this video.  Then you come back in a few days and do the same thing. You are just testing the boundaries and letting them know you are determined. If a manager speaks to you, refer them to Rocco's video on the CRC about mask laws and business owners. The exemption protects them too.</p>
<p>The mistake is that people get flustered, they start to panic, or take this personally and belittle the enforcer. And definitely don't try to run away like this woman in the video did. Do not swear, do not act combative, and I would recommend you shouldn't scream. The best approach is to be lighthearted and make your rights clear but don't ruin someone's day. In many cases you will never have to show your card if you're polite</p>
<p>Option 2 which people who don't know these laws do is just go in and wait until someone calls the cops. It works, you just walk out and accept your fine. But we preferably don't want high profile confrontations or our activists being hit with looming threats which could take them out of the game</p>

        <p>In America businesses are considered private property. So unless the reason falls under the civil rights act of 1967 then a business can make you leave at any time for any other reason. In most states if a business asks you to leave and you refuse then you can be arrested, or cited, for trespassing. You can also be banned from entering the business ever again and if you do you can face a trespassing charge. So technically removing someone from a business on the request of the business owner, or their agent, is upholding the law.</p>
<p>I have done it hundreds of times, only arrested someone once. People will stick to their beliefs until the second the handcuffs come out or you start reading them their rights.</p>
<p>Most of the time it as simple as them seeing you walk in and they start walking out the door. Or if they don’t see you then telling them they have to leave. Sure you get a verbal assault, but words don’t hurt cops. We are used to it</p>
