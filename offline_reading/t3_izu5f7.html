    <strong>The "Second Wave" started on 9/22, all across the globe.....</strong>
    <p><p>I think things like this should make it pretty clear that we are being subjected to a well planned, very coordinated effort at this point. What is the plan? Why all the coordination, on a global scale? I don't know. What I do know is this, too many people are unwilling or unable to recognize it and we are losing so much more than most people seem to realize. </p>
<p>I am not worried about a virus. Viruses and colds and infections and the flu are a part of life. They have been since the dawn of man. I am not scared of dying. We have always known it will happen at some point. I am terrified of the world my 3 young children are going to be forced to live in because of what is playing out in front of all of us, right now. </p>
<p>I want my children to be happy and free, to have a better life than I did. That is all I care about. I don't know if that will be possible if we continue on the trajectory we are on. I don't know if my boys will have a chance to play sports, like I did. I don't know if they will have the college experience. There are so many things that seem to have an uncertain future. These things keep me awake at night.</p>

        <p>I don't know if doing something like that would be necessary or helpful. Reason being, the media and their journalists are simply relaying whatever message they are told to relay. That message is created somewhere, by someone or a group of someones. The public health people touch it. The elected officials weigh in. The Fauci crew, the scientists and so on. No matter what, the messages are carefully crafted. But, its the source, the people who develop the message that are hard to find. I wouldn't know how get to the primary source that develops the messages we're being given these days.</p>
<p>I don't care what anyone says at this point. When the same message is being communicated on the same days, all over the world, it is a coordinated effort. The media outlets probably don't even realize it. Hell, most people seeing it have no idea. But, when you do specific searches, for specific things on specific dates, it is quite easy to find things like my original post. Case numbers, death rates, number of deaths on a specific day, all kinds of stuff is being communicated in the same way, on the same days, at every corner of the world. Once you pull all of it together and put it side by side, you see the repetition. I've never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>I am an investigative researcher. I find information for independent journalists in the US. I find things like this all the time. But, its not the most concerning things I see. This stuff just tells me what this pandemic is all about. Its the shit everyone is being distracted from, with mask arguments, social distancing disagreements, etc, we need to be concerned about. </p>
<p>I am developing a story about the lady that runs the National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, the NCIRD. The lady's name is Nancy Messonnier. You probably haven't heard of her. Very few people have. Very few people have ever heard of the NCIRD. I think she is a bigger problem than Fauci, Brix and Redfield combined. She's one of the leads on the Warp Speed bullshit. She has been the lead on the weekly conference call between the public health people and the media and local and state officials. Interestingly enough, she was the lead doctor on one the Gates foundations vaccine projects in Africa. She oversees the disease surveillance program that was born out of the vaccine program. And, she is the sister of Rod Rosenstein, the guy who wanted to wear a wire to record his meetings with Donald Trump a couple of years ago. Big story coming out on this information soon.</p>
<p>There is a lot of nefarious shit going on with this pandemic. Its really tough to put a finger on what that one big things is though. I guess we'll know soon enough.</p>

        <p>I think I'm more concerned about what they are doing over at World Economic Forum. The plan they are rolling out in January of next year, just after inauguration day coincidentally, is going to change everything, on a global scale. Most people dont know about it or how it will change our daily lives, dramatically. </p>
<p>The pandemic and all the manufactured hysteria, that comes with it,  is the villain we have been told to focus on. But, as are leaning, there isnt much to look at. Its not the worst pandemic in history. So, why are we really being forced to look at it and fear it 24 hours a day?</p>
<p>There always has to be a villain or a hero out in front, for us to love or hate, to blame or to admire. That person or thing is usually just a figurehead or a front, for everyone to see or touch. There is always someone or something else behind the curtain, pushing thr buttons and pulling the levers that actually make the whole thing go. </p>
<p>Its like the Fauci phenomenon. He is out in front, doing interviews, throwing baseballs, giving us all directions to follow. We're told he is the covid master. I think he is just playing the role of hero or villain, depending on how you look at things. We see and hear him all day long. He keeps our ttention away from people like the lady at the NCIRD, the people overseeing the warp speed project and others that I believe are much more concerning and influential than Fauci will ever be. He is a figurehead. The people behind the curtain are cooking up vaccines, developing disease surveillance programs and managing all our health data that's being collected in the name of keep us safe from the covid.</p>
<p>I try to pay more attention to the people or groups of people that aren't being shoved down our throats all day long, what they are doing. Its those people and those groups that are doing the things and directing the things that are affecting us the most right now.</p>
<p>If you have some free time, peruse the WEF website. Very interesting information on there for all to see.</p>

        <p>Nice work!! This is great info and we appreciate your effort. </p>
<p>I understand what you're saying about the message being relayed. What you highlighted with Nancy Messonnier is exactly what I'd like to uncover. How do we spot the Nancy's using data? Surely we could trace this stuff back to common denominators or regions (cough China cough)?</p>
<p>Yeah we probably get the obvious suspects, like Fauci, showing up as influencers. But there has to be more.</p>

        <p>Messonnier came up in a crazy way. Someone I know got a call from someone who said she was with a group representing the CDC, a few weeks ago. This group was doing a survey to find out immunization records for everyone in the household between the ages of 4 and 18. They were really pushing for the info. They wanted  to have permission to contact the kids doctors to obtain the information. No way any sane parent would willingly allow the CDC to contact their kids doctors to get health info. Next thing you know, CDC is at your door with CPS to stick a bunch of needles in your kid or something! Anyways, the call ended and a few days passed. The damn CDC called and ended up offering my friend money for the information they wanted. $30 or $50 a kid I think. It was insane. Paying parents to hand over the keys to their kids health info. I couldn't believe it. </p>
<p>After that second call I started looking into some things. Turns out the NCIRD is the organization that ends up getting all the health information that ends up getting collected. One thing led to another and now I have a story about an organization, run by a woman that oversees a disease and vaccine surveillance program in Africa for the Gates foundation,  that is aggressively trying to collect american children's health information, just before an untested and unproven vaccine is set to be released, to stop a pandemic that isn't really a pandemic. </p>
<p>Its a mess. All of it. Over the last several months I have learned that all the same people seem to be connected to or involved in everything going on around us. Some directly. Others are related to or married to someone that is involved. Then you have people that did something years ago that ends up having to do with something happening now. Its almost hard to believe at times, even when I have 100% irrefutable information right in front of me. </p>
<p>I am very anxious about what happens next, as we get closer to the elections. These people that want to be in control, absolutely, will do and say anything to make it happen.</p>

        <p>Nope. Not suicidal at all. I do my work very carefully. I always have. I don't let anyone credit me when my work is used in articles or in anything else it might be used for. I don't care about credit or attention. A lot of my work has been used in many of the stories that have been written recently. I have no interest in taking any unnecessary risks for credit or attention. Not with the kind of things I am asked to dig into. And, especially with how people are behaving these days. </p>
<p>Attention and credit is not why I do what I do anyways. I'm trying to do whatever I can to make sure the information and stories get out to people. Its always been important for people to hear the stroies that rarely get told but, its even more important now than it's ever been. And, to be honest, I really enjoy the work. It can be very stressful at times and the things I find can be disturbing but, I really enjoy the process of finding the information for the people who use it. Its creative work and analytical work at the same time. I never get bored. Thats for sure. And, its always interesting to see what happens after the information breaks, in articles or whatever else.</p>
<p>So, no. I like being alive. Even now, with all the chaos and sadness we're all dealing with. I guess, just in case, I am stating, I am not suicidal now, nor will I ever be. Somebody save this just in case.</p>

        <p>Can you make a specific post about this and make it a poll? I sorta need this at least as the first set of requirements for such an application.  I had scratched some concepts for the past 5 years, however I haven't been able to pinpoint what exactly will drive users to make such a post. </p>
<p>I would like to think of it as a "data analytics tool for the common man, easy to use as pinterest" as the value proposition hypothesis.  </p>
<p>The main problem it was meant to solve was the lack of the ability to archive and collect comments mainly on Twitter and Facebook. It seem that now the need is centered around reddit. Tweet thread curation seems to be a thing. However a fully comprehensive tool that bookmarks, archives and organizes doesnt exist as far as I know</p>
<p>Other features may include being able to archive with timestamp sort by chronological order. Being able to make simple pie charts and bar graphs with custom label would also be a feature.</p>

        <p>You don't know the why? It should be obvious to everyone on this sub by now.</p>
<p>The goal is to impose a worldwide communist technocracy with money replaced by social credit, where everyone is under 24x7 surveillance, tracking and monitoring by Big Tech operating on behalf of our hidden masters.</p>

        <p>You are exactly right. Doing this demoralizes people. Tighten the noose, get everyone all worked up and pissed off. Loosen it for a little while and everyone is happy and hopeful. Shortly after people relax, tighten it again, even more so than the last time. People go right back to being pissed off. Do that enough times and everyone stops getting mad about it. Instead, they become exhausted and sad. Demoralized. Its text book psychological abuse if you really think about it.</p>

<p>&rt;The evidence presented in this paper indicates that there should be  no expectation of a large scale ‘second wave’ with smaller localised  outbreaks when the virus contacts pockets of previously uninfected  populations.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Current mass testing using the PCR test is inappropriate in its  current form. If it is to continue, then results and reporting should be  refined to meet the gold standard of testing methodology to give  clinicians improved information so that they are able to make  appropriate clinical decisions. Positive tests should be confirmed by  testing a second sample and all positive tests should be reported along  with the Cycle Threshold (Ct) obtained during the test to aid assessment  of a patient’s viral load.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is recommended that a greater focus be placed on evidence-based  medicine rather than highly sensitive theoretical modelling based on  assumptions and unknowns.</p>

I likewise have the same fears for my children but if you're going to swing for the fences at least share where you got it from.</p>

        <p>Well, you can take a look at the headlines of all the articles in the image posted. Those are real headlines, from real articles, written by actual people. So, I'm not sure what you would like me to provide sources for. There are a dozen or so in that nice grid collage that I spent too much time on. Would you like me to put together a bibliography or something for you? That seems a bit much but, I'll see what I can do.</p>
