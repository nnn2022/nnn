    <strong>Sanest US states?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m young and mobile, and I’d love to relocate, temporarily or permanently, to a place most likely to resist (or at least ignore) a nationwide mask mandate and/or mandatory vaccinations. </p>
<p>I’m on the west coast and it is truly bad (and lonely) here. Is it true that anywhere except the coasts is good and people aren’t buying it? If so, it’s definitely a tale of two countries going on. </p>
<p>Where would you live right now if you could live anywhere, considering reactions to the mandates but also livability. For instance South Dakota seems really damned cold and isolated.</p></p>

        <p>West coast is terrible no matter what. You would be hard pressed to do worse. Still, you might want to until the dust settles. What is good today may be tomorrow's next big tragedy. Alex Berenson was saying he was glad he didn't relocate, from New York of all places, because now that the virus has beaten itself, the northeast is better than some other places due to its low case rate. Similarly, a couple of months ago, I would have said New Zealand or Australia look good. Now they are among the worst police states in the western world.</p>
<p>The states that did not have lockdowns (Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) still look mostly sane, though Arkansas does have a mask mandate now, but could be one governor election (2022) away from that changing. The Dakotas and Nebraska seem the safest in that regard. Then there are states like Georgia and Florida, which did lockdown, but reopened early and have governors who seem to understand what they are doing. I'd be worried about Florida longer term.</p>

        <p>Good analysis. I wonder, though, when will the dust settle, if ever? You feel really crazy being an LDS on the west coast. It takes a tremendous amount of mental energy and is so lonely. </p>
<p>It sucks that New York is technically saner, only because of the case numbers (blah freaking blah), not because of principled opposition to government overreach and its dystopian corollaries. </p>
<p>I’ve been to Lincoln, NE and that it was an okay place. Wonder if the winters are any less harsh there than SD.</p>

        <p>Hilariously enough, as a young bartender looking to relocate from Maine to somewhere warm, with more people with less restrictions, I've been doing a lot of looking into it myself. And I literally just got done with a little research session.</p>
<p>In short: it REALLY seems like it depends on the county/city.</p>
<p>Most large or large-ish cities are gonna be a no-go. But in general, seeing as you seem to not like rural and cold, I found that Georgia, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee seem like the best places to go as far as no masks and things being open where there's also a good amount of people and has warmer weather.</p>
<p>Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming are also solid options, but are colder and/or have less people.</p>
<p>I hate discussing or even mentioning politics, but if you want to move somewhere that's more likely to say screw masks, go somewhere that's ran by a Republican governor. There are 16 states that don't mandate mask-wearing in public, and all 16 are ran by Republican governors.</p>
<p>In addition, rural America (the north, midwest, central US, etc.) tends to receive less tourists and really hasn't been all that effected by the virus and also contain more Republicans who are more likely to say fuck masks. Like up where I am in northern Maine, we're pretty much uneffected, yet still have regulations and mandates pushed upon us. But no business enforces the regulations and no one wears masks aside from places that are governmental or have their HQ elsewhere and really force you to. Essentially no independent businesses put up with the mask shit, and the citizens hate dealing with it.</p>
<p><strong>So if you really want the best shot to avoid all this mask shit, go somewhere rural with Conservative people with a Republican governor.</strong></p>
<p>The best two sites I've found to gather some of this information have been:</p>
<p>(States that are mandating public mask-wearing) - https://www.axios.com/states-face-coverings-mandatory-a0e2fe35-5b7b-458e-9d28-3f6cdb1032fb.html</p>
<p>(In what capacity restaurants and bars can open, by state) - https://www.eater.com/21264229/where-restaurants-reopened-across-the-u-s</p>
<p>So, to recap:</p>
<p><strong>Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wyoming</strong></p>

        <p>What about Utah? Outside of SLC and like 2 or 3 other counties, there’s no mask mandate there. Even the SLC suburbs that are part of other counties don’t have mask mandates as far as I know.</p>

        <p>Haha, I get it. Everyone on reddit is duly concerned about their privacy and also probably concerned about west coasters fleeing their crapholes only to try to change the places they move to into similar crapholes. I guess I feel like there’s power in numbers. I’m visiting some states in the heartland this fall and possibly Florida at summer’s end, so that’ll give me some perspective. I can’t wait to see some bare faces.</p>

        <p>Well, outside of the major cities it isn’t being enforced. Several county sheriffs have said they won’t enforce it, and in rural areas nobody really cares.  </p>
<p>Every big retail chain is requiring masks.  Small businesses may or may not.</p>
<p>The only thing I would worry about, regardless of what state I was in, would be some Karen recording me not wearing a mask and starting a scene.</p>

<p>FL panhandle was great, everything is open and normal. Not so much Miami and I got scolded by police in the Keys for having my mask down.</p>
<p>Louisiana was more strict, especially NOLA, so was northern Alabama. Southern AL was good.</p>

        <p>Utah is pretty good. No statewide mask mandate. Salt Lake has one, but pretty much everywhere else doesn't. Utah County has been very loose from the beginning, and there doesn't seem to be much support for lockdowns or masks in general.</p>

        <p>Like for gay conversion therapy? Where would you say doesn’t suck? I know this sounds awful but I don’t have kids right now and when I do have them, I don’t plan on abusing them or sending them to be converted if they are gay. I feel like as long as the state doesn’t abuse ADULTS, I can get by. I don’t know if that makes me a bad person, or what...</p>

        <p>Some of it is gay conversion therapy. Some of it is for kids who get big enough to fight back when their parents try to beat the shit out of them, some of it is for kids with anorexia or autism or stuttering or whatever else they think they can beat out of them. Even if I don’t have kids, I couldn’t stand paying state taxes to a state that would allow those things to happen. </p>
<p>South Dakota seems pretty sane from what I’ve heard. The more rural you go the more chill people seem to be.</p>

        <p>NH is just a small less Blue state surrounded by deep blue.  Its got some pros like a strong libertarian network but far from ideal.  And yes it does bode Ill that it's surrounded by "democratic socialism" states.</p>

        <p>I was disappointed by W. Virginia's government decision to issue a statewide mandate as well! Do you think their governor did it because he is up for re-election this year? While they have the mandate, I believe there's no penalty for not complying other than businesses being allowed to deny you service.</p>

        <p>I would think you need to check whether the governor's is clearly against lockdowns. If they previously quarantined I wouldn't trust much, because they may keep changing their position and a relocation is not simple.</p>
