    <strong>DAE get hit with the "your SO got it, shouldn't you get it to show support with them?"</strong>
    <p><p>topic, sorry for DAE but it's been bugging me.</p>
<p>So my stance is pretty firm on not getting it, for now.  Main reasons (including but not limited to):</p>
<p>1) No long term testing.  Being in research for 20 years does not equal long term tested.  Asbestos, as an example of why lack of long term testing is important.</p>
<p>2) COVID 19 is not a huge threat for my age group.  Last time I checked the CFR ( Case Fatality Rate ) from the CDC located <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics">here</a>, I found my age group has a CFR of rougly 1 in 2,000, ignoring all other factors such as obesity.  The Delta variant is honestly more of a joke, cases are always mentioned but the death rate is low and never mentioned.  Source, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1001358/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_18.pdf">New England Public Health Tech Briefing 18</a></p>
<p>2a) <a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/there-is-no-evidence-that-the-delta-variant-of-sars-cov-2-has-a-lower-fatality-rate-than-the-wild-type-virus-craig-kelly-dan-bongino/">I found a fact check that tried to say the Delta is more serious</a>, however from point 2 anyone can do the simple math of Unvaccinated Deaths divided by Unvaccinated Cases.  It's 21 / 70,664 = 0.03% or 1 in 3,364 for people under the age of 50, found on page 16&amp;17 of the Technical breifing 18.  Hell, even the CFR from Tech Briefing 18 states on page 11 "Case fatality rate is only calculated for those with at least 28 days since specimen date." meaning it's only counting people who tested postive 28 days ago or more.  So there goes any chance of "the deaths weren't updated!" unless they have like a 5 week lead time... which they might, and is exactly why I've been following all the technical briefings on Delta to see if anything major has changed.  Which used to be called research but is now called misinformation.</p>
<p>3) Personal anecdote, everyone I know directly who tested positive has recovered completely.  No long term effects, nothing.  A few 20 something cousins, people in their 80s and people in their 70s.  Everyone still kicking and they caught it before the vaccine.  So yea, I know my chances are good when the 70+ alcoholic survived it.</p>
<p>4) I never take medicine for anything.  I take only if I need it.  Hangover?  Too bad, I tough it out. The only "meds" I've been taking is Vitamin D supplement and a Daily Vitamin for over 2 years now - only because I had bloodwork done and it was shown to help (which it did when I had my physical, as bloodwork was much improved).  I was and still am against people snorting adderall and the like to get through work/school.  I don't even drink soda or cheap snacks, my diet consists of meat and veggies and I actively avoid bread or pasta.  Point being, I do care what I put in my body.</p>
<p>Every single time I go through these reasons it branches off into two paths.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Path 1 - "But you are just going around spreading it then!" (no i'm not, had anti body test done and I was negative so it was literally impossible for me to spread because I never had it).  <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article">Also asymptomatic spread research is a joke and isn't a thing, from the CDC itself</a> and the quote "In this cluster of COVID-19 cases, little to no transmission occurred from asymptomatic case-patients. Presymptomatic transmission was more frequent than symptomatic transmission."  This is literally result #1 for me when I search "asympotmatic covid spread" on DuckDuckGo.  Presymptomatic is not really defined well.  Some symptoms but not all?  0-100 real fast?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Path 2 - Topic.  Get hit with the emotional appeal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not going to lie, been with my SO for over 3 years now and this is causing a huge rift between us.  Their family has shut me out, I've been told I'm being stupid and unreasonable by their family members behind my back, but are all pleasant to my face.  Meanwhile I look at the above data and.. I'm just not scared.  More people have died in my graduating class of high school from suicide than covid.</p></p>
