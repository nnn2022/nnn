    <strong>Why even the curve was not flattened?</strong>
    <p><p>Lockdowns reduced the number of interactions between people.</p>
<p>But a birds eye view between US states or European countries does not show a different curve. UK and Sweden or California and Texas. You donÂ´t see a clearly different pattern. You dont see the bell becoming a flat hill.</p>
<p>At best, what you could see was that some places were hit hard sometimes later. Argentina, Czechia and Germany are the case: the worst took place in the end of 2020 and early 2021.</p>
<p>Even that is not guaranteed. Look at Peru. Locked down ultra hard in the very first few cases, closed the border but had an unbelievably agressive curve in order to reach the worst number in the world in deaths per capita.</p>
<p>That, apparently, did not make sense. How lesser interactions between people has not resulted in a longer pandemic that did not have the profile of a bell?</p>
<p>How lockdowns failed to do even THAT? Even to slow the spread?</p></p>

        <p>Because COVID began in October 2019 at the latest, and was present in the West by November 2019 at the latest.</p>
<p>Lockdowns can only work even in theory if they're established when a disease is at a very low level.</p>

<p>That does not look flat, specially the one about deaths.</p>

        <p>So there's a whole subreddit dedicated to corona as a hoax. Leads to people ignoring it. Leads to deaths. </p>
<p>Can't flatten what you don't believe in. People have been ignoring and downplaying this since March 2020. You're on a sub that actively promotes ignoring safety, please understand how the two are related without me going on</p>
