    <strong>Pregnant during the drama?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, so I realize this is a pregmancy question, however there is NO WAY I can post this in that section because they are all about the covid. So if you are pregnant, how was your experiance as far as dr. Visits, birthing in the hospital, and postpartum visits? Were you forced to wear a mask during labor, did they force vaccines on you? I am terrified to go into my appointment because of the fearmongering, and I am already anti vax  as is (not going to put that into a tiny baby!) Anyone have any experiance who is a NNN? Thank you!</p></p>

        <p>Just delivered my baby 3 weeks ago. I know it depends on the hospital and the state but I had to go to all my dr visits alone and wear a mask in the office. I did get the recommended flu and DTAP vaccines but I would have anyway, â€˜rona or not.</p>
<p>In labor and delivery my husband and I wore our masks in while being admitted (through the ER) and my L&amp;D nurse told me while they were in the room I was technically supposed to wear a mask but they were super laid back and didnâ€™t enforce it. I actually ended up not even wearing mine and none of them said anything. My nurse asked me to wear one once we transferred to a different room but she was not demanding about it.</p>
<p>My husband was the only one allowed in the hospital and he was able to stay. No visitors. He actually had to go home a day early to work but he was allowed to come back on the unit the next day to help us discharge. We didnâ€™t wear masks the entire time we were there except when we left the room to go anywhere else in the hospital. </p>
<p>I was admitted Sunday night, delivered early Monday morning and discharged Wednesday morning. There was really only one nurse who was a little b****y about the mask but she only made one comment then I guess realized it was a lost cause. My mask was the last thing on my mind after birthing a baby.</p>

        <p>Thank you! Glad they didn't force you to wear a mask while pushing out a baby!</p>

        <p>For real! I couldnâ€™t imagine wearing a mask during actual pushing! And I threw up everywhere during labor so a mask would have made it so much lovelierðŸ˜‚</p>
