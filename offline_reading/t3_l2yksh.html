    <strong>Don't bully fellow humans, they are in a state of psychosis ("doomer" related)</strong>
    <p><p>"What is psychosis? Each one of us has a family member or a friend etc who were seemingly normal before 2020, and then it's as if they went crazy. They are not blind, but they do not see the obvious in front of them. They are not retarded, but the impression is that during the last 10 months all scientific knowledge, memory, adequate perception of surroundings and the ability to logic, i.e. the ability to see events around them as they are, have been erased from their heads. The consciousness of such people resembles, in a sense, a magnetic tape from which a part of the record has been erased. They suffer from psychosis, a disease of the brain, which is expressed in impairment of consciousness, i.e. a person's ability to correctly reflect the surrounding reality in order to affect it purposefully.</p>
<p>The cause of many psychoses are unfavorable social conditions, while the physiological basis of psychosis - are such changes in higher nervous activity which disrupt the connection between certain parts of the brain. In this case, the human second signaling system (i.e. intellect, memory, ability to analyze and synthesize, as well as the higher human feelings) is affected the most and most severely. Thus, in a prolonged state of fear and constant intimidation, higher conditioned reflexes atrophy, until the most ancient, unconditioned, inherent in all animals, remain - the instinct of self-preservation, feeding and reproduction. The more intimidated and oppressed a person is, the less human he is. On this foundation was organized the "remaking" of workers in Hitler's labor camps. This is the same principle upon which all of today's fascist propaganda and social life is based.</p>
<p>The work of the brain comes in the form of reflexes and is based on the unity of excitation and inhibition processes. These processes have different strength and mobility, they are more or less balanced with each other. If social, i.e. external conditions disturb normal activity of the brain, for example, a person lives a long time in a state of fear or expectation of something horrible, then the strength, mobility and balance of inhibition and excitation are disturbed. There is a pathological state of the nervous system, irritation and inhibition are overstretched and quickly change each other, as if colliding with each other. A breakdown of nervous activity occurs. Especially easily this disruption occurs when the nerve cells are deliberately weak, when they have already been weakened by illnesses of the body, alcohol, previous episodes of psycological suffering, i.e. everything that the life under capitalism is generously equipped with. The intensification of psycological sufferung under fascism is the strongest irritant, which either overstrains the nervous processes or leads to such a weakening of the nerve cells that even ordinary, normal stimuli in daily life become unbearable for a person, overpowering, causing "stalling", delirium, a blurring of the mind. This, in particular, explains the aggressiveness of some ordinary people right now, who are ready to attack those without a diaper on their face on public transport and in stores. They say the craziest things on the Internet etc. The immediate cause of this psychosis is the indoctrinated fear of death "from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Fear is one of the causes of the so-called inordinate inhibition of nervous activity. This inhibition affects not only the cortex, but also the subcortex. It spreads differently in the cortex and subcortex, and at the same time has different strength in different parts of the cortex. Such inhibition has the strongest effect on the highest parts of the cortex, the highest instances of the second signaling system, i.e. the social thinking. Because of this, all kinds of intermediate states such as hypnosis or intoxication, hysteria, outbursts of aggression, etc., can be observed, when the person does not know what they are saying or doing. </p>
<p>On the other hand, constant fear causes disorders in excitation processes in the brain, when excitation loses its purposefulness. In such a condition, the person is badly aware of their actions, for example, they forget to put on a hat in cold, wet weather, but at the same time are always wearing a surgical mask. But it also happens that the excitation process seems to get fixed in one particular place. In this case there is a focus of pathological inertness in the cerebral cortex. Its character depends on what part of the cortex such fixation occurred in. And the trouble here is that such a pathological focus, caused, for example, by acute fear, can remain for a very long time, for years. A person who has suffered the fear of starvation or unemployment for years, or who once went mad because of the "covid" hysteria, may have deviations in their psyche even when the fascist dictatorship is defeated, the viral lie of the bourgeoisie is fully proven, and the preconditions for starvation and unemployment have been removed entirely."</p>

        <p>Yes, they are psychotic, but more importantly, they are victims of trauma-based mind control. They need to be freed and deprogrammed. </p>
<p>Cathy O'Brien's speech on this is highly relevant.

        <p>I’ve been in  a state of psychosis for about a month not too long ago. Not fun stuff. But I’d say they’re more delusional than psychotic.</p>
