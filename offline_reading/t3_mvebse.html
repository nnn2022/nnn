    <strong>UW "study"--Manipulation of "Long-Hauler" Data</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/%E2%80%8Beven-mild-cases-covid-19-impact-can-persist">https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/%E2%80%8Beven-mild-cases-covid-19-impact-can-persist</a></p>
<p>It seems hard to define what "long-hauler" even means, but the media likes to portray it as a chronic/never-ending condition. That's extremely misleading.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392393/">This data</a> shows that about a third of people still have lingering symptoms after 2-3 weeks. Fine, that I can accept. And <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/datasets/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveydata">sampling the UK population</a> suggested about 1 in 5 after 5 weeks and 1 in 10 after 12 weeks.</p>
<p>I noticed something interesting: there's almost a perfect inverse relationship between the fraction of people and number of weeks passed. It's roughly:</p>
<p>After 3 weeks: 1 in 3 still have some lingering symptoms</p>
<p>After 5 weeks: 1 in 5 still have some lingering symptoms</p>
<p>After 10 weeks (rounded): 1 in 10 still have some lingering symptoms</p>
<p>Clearly it's not black-and-white--immune systems that take a little longer are still working. It's possible we could apply that correlation above to estimate longer-term cases too. In this case, 1 in 50 would still have some remnants of symptoms after 50 weeks (around a year)--and it's also related to risk-factors, as well as things we can control like our daily vitamin intake.</p>
<p>But of course, just to make things interesting, University of Washington had to release this <a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/%E2%80%8Beven-mild-cases-covid-19-impact-can-persist">pseudo-study:</a></p>
<p>Now suddenly 1/3 of people say they're still affected 6 to 9 months after their diagnosis. One researcher had the nerve to say this was "consistent" with the stat above (1/3 still reporting them after 2-3 weeks). That's what I call "brain fog" right there: WTF? Do you think the virus has a built-in timer that determines that, once it's been there for 3 weeks, it's now a long-hauler and will stay there forever?! </p>
<p>Science doesn't work that way--and if 1 in every 3 people who were diagnosed last summer were still sick (beyond what the New Normal has already done to all of us), it would be big news, and wouldn't require an obscure study to discover. But people still believe this, and this UW number is now being cited in podcasts/videos regarding long-haulers. Whenever we have a reasonable risk estimate, they have to bring out some monster idea that contradicts everything.</p>
<p>I just want to know one thing: how did U-Dub actually pull this off, so they could release these numbers while technically following study guidelines?</p></p>

        <p>There were an unprecedented number of calls to poison control last year for cleaning chemical exposure.</p>
<p>Id be willing to bet a bunch of these 'long haulers' mixed (or keep mixing) cleaning chemicals, basically mustard gassing themselves.</p>
