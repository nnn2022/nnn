<p>Hi, this is my first reddit post ever, wanna see your thoughts, this man died in his sleep at home after "Battling" covid, i was thinking if he was really battling it, shouldn't he have been in a hospital.. anyways just more unnecessary fear. does this not happen with the flu too?</p></p>

        <p>“He was like a brother and a son to me at the same time.” Yeah...sure. Guy’s really laying it on thick. While it’s sad that people are dying from this, that was always inevitable. It was clear to me back in March that even if their projections were wildly pessimistic regarding the death rate, there was no stopping this. Sucks</p>

        <p>I know someone who lost a college age son to the flu who died in his sleep. It’s beyond tragic. It actually boggles the human mind and is too upsetting to look at head on.</p>
<p>But is no different than when you slip and fall and hit your head at just the wrong angle you freakin die. Or the silent brain aneurysm.</p>
<p>These things are tragic. Tragic isn’t even strong enough a word for it. That’s why it evokes such a strong response. But locking down won’t prevent young people from dying in freak accidents, or from covid.</p>

        <p>The <em>youngest</em> death was an overweight dude in his 30s????? Are you shittin me? Why on Earth are children being kept out of school then? And before you say they could be these silent-but-deadly disease carriers, realize that it’s pretty fucked up for full grown adults (who themselves enjoyed an undisrupted normal education when they were that age), to deny that to <em>children</em> for the sake of adults’ well-being. There is an association between children’s educational attainment and years of life lost associated with primary school closures. Scientists published recently in JAMA estimate that missed instruction during 2020 could be associated with as much as 5.53 million years of life lost. Adults <em>should</em> be winning to risk whatever it takes so that children can have an education. Anything else is shameful.</p>

        <p>Here in CT at the beginning of the lockdown, youngest "covid" death was a newborn.. but other sources claim the baby was accidentally suffocated to death.  They never release the autopsy results..</p>
