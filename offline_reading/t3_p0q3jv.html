    <strong>Question about exemptions</strong>
    <p><p>I thought I was in the clear but I was told today I’ll need to get the jab. My husband and a friend started our own business and we all agreed none of us were ready to get the jab. However we will be working in the music industry and we were told that venues are going to mandate vaccination as well as festivals.. 
Are actual exemptions a thing or will I have to provide a negative test each time? I really really really don’t want this vaccine. I also really want to live out my dream. I hate this so much.</p></p>

        <p>Choices. I know for me this is the hill I die on. I would literally rather die than be forced to take an injection just to participate in society.</p>
<p>You have to decide what you really want and hopefully you make the right choice.</p>
<p>Remember once you've been vaccinated you can't be un vaccinated but you can always find a way to play music.</p>

        <p>Heard my favorite fest that I have attended for 10 years was demanding workers/volunteers to get the shots and was very surprised and disappointed by this. I thought the family and musicians involved were accepting of people’s personal choices. It has been happening more, and I decided a while ago I would refuse to attend any event that had passports. I got this news as I was driving to a much smaller and more local fest this weekend, who’s organizers kept the music going last year. While the qualify of musicians is not equal, the music has still been great, and it has been life saving to have access to my favorite pastime, which is my therapy. It sucks, I feel ya, and I hold no judgment towards those that took it. I’m being told it will be the band’s decision on whether or not certain events will require it, so I just hope my favs don’t do so.  I am quite shocked bc support for this shit is contradictory to the values of the bluegrass and hippie community. The bluegrass community in particular, with roots in coal mining and other oppressive employment, was particularly disappointing. They done sold themselves to the mine</p>
