    <strong>Why do people get the shot because their employer wants them to?</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, this is a very privileged take, I understand that. A lot people canâ€™t just quit their jobs, they have families to support and bills to pay. Weâ€™ve all had to put up with stuff we donâ€™t like at work, but I would NEVER get a vaccine to appease my employer. No amount of money is worth my health.</p>
<p>I spent many years in school to work in the legal field. Iâ€™ve been working at a law office for over a year. My employer wanted to mandate vaccines (which I find odd because they never cared if we wore masks) so I quietly put in my two-week notice. I was planning on leaving within five months due to my pregnancy so it wasnâ€™t a big deal. Iâ€™m lucky enough to have a husband who can support me while I stay home. After I left, I thought to myself, what else have I wanted to do? Soon enough, I got a job at a bakery. Iâ€™ve been working there for a couple weeks and honestly, it is much better than my previous job. Iâ€™m not making lawyer money, but itâ€™s fun.</p>
<p>My point is, I donâ€™t understand why people feel forced to get the shot if their employer wants it. Chances are, you wouldnâ€™t be working there for the rest of your life. Why would you make a major medical decision based on what your boss wants? Sure, you may be going from a six-figure IT job to a middle class job, but is that sports car and biannual vacation going to matter when you have a heart condition or cancer?</p></p>

        <p>I can't answer your question, because I am refusing the shot even though my employer is now mandating it.</p>
<p>I do not have the luxury of just not working, or only working part time. I am the primary source of income in my household.
Even so, my life is worth more to me than a job. A company will gladly lay anyone off anytime. There are other opportunities out there, but only if my life and my health are intact.
I am willing to risk everything to maintain my freedom of choice.</p>

        <p>They cant force you to do it unless you work for the gov, they annoy the shit out of people in the corporate world with mandatory surveys and you have to fill out an religious exception waiver to get out of it. Most people see that as an annoyance i think. </p>
<p>Also you get to take your mask off once your vacced up, big carrot on a stick</p>

        <p>I don't agree with businesses forcing people to get vaccinated but as you say in your post, you are extremely lucky to be on the situation you're in. What if your husband's employer mandates it too? Are you guys gonna be ok with him quitting and working in a bakery too? For a lot of people it's not just that they're not gonna have a sports car and will be middle class. But in that vein, it's good for those who can stand up to this to do so.</p>
