    <strong>Have you ever known a ‚Äúsheep‚Äù to regret the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p><em>I realize this sub is pro-choice and I don‚Äôt mean someone who has personal reasons for getting a Covid vaccine.</em></p>
<p>...I‚Äôm talking about the kind of person who follows in line with authority because they were told and expects the same from everyone else, has anyone ever witnessed a change in someone like that?</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt even mean an extremist, just the average sheep..</p></p>

        <p>One of my parents' friend has stage 4 rectal cancer eagerly got the first shot, waiting for the 2nd. The first shot paralyzed him for a week but he still saying it's worth it and waiting for his 2nd. I don't think he can survive his 2nd shot. </p>

        <p>My mom got it bc she "felt so pressured".  Mind you she does not work so there was no threat of being fired. Her mother in law told her to get vaccinated, her neighbor gave her a weird look upon learning she was not vaccinated and the news told her to get vaccinatedü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è She doesn't tell others to get vaccinated though. </p>
<p>Anyhow, the vaccine fucked her up and now she regrets it. Says she won't get any boosters.....</p>

        <p>Dizzy, tired, can't breathe right. About 2 weeks after 2nd shot she ended up hospitalized and stayed a few days for supplemental oxygen. Released but still messed up. Now she has a (brand new) asthma diagnosis and daily inhaler that does nothing but at least she hasn't been hospitalized again.</p>

        <p>I went with her to the ER and we brought it up. The nurse and doctor both immediately dismissed it could be related to the vaccine. No reason given, just nah. I couldn't be there with her while she was in patient but she says she brought it up with the doctor she saw there and with the pulmonologist she saw later and was similarly dismissed even though they tested her for everything else under the sun and couldn't find anything. </p>
<p>As to whether they reported to VAERS, idk, I doubt it but couldn't say for sure. I've told her to call the hospital and check but she won't. I asked the nurse about it during her discharge and the nurse said she had never heard of VAERS. </p>
<p>The whole immediately denying any connection to the vaccine is what has me so convinced it is not worth the risk. I know of 2 other people who had bad reactions but were similarly dismissed. I don't doubt this is happening everywhere and things are not being reported. It's scary.</p>

<p>I only got it to end the mask mandate (remember that?) but my arm has been sore ever since (they're calling it "COVID arm").</p>
<p>Plus I'm finding out all this new info on the vax that they never made public (or buried it) --based on an immune problem I have, I probably shouldn't have taken it.</p>
