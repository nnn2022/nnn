        <p>Because you listen to the same people who are trying to kill everyone with this Vaccines of course they going to tell you its good for our health look at bill gates why is he even pushing vaccines he doesn't even have a medical degree, ask yourself why would people accuse the government of killing their kids if this is not true, because the kids are dying by the millions, do you even know what they put in the vaccines? They them self's admit, do you even know what they put in these vaccines? <a href="https://vaccine.guide/vaccine-ingredients/overview/cdc-vaccine-excipient-and-media-summary/">look for your self</a></p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/vaccines/@steemtruth/vaccines-kill-children-here-is-proof">here is prove of vaccines killing kids</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/B2N35yVQcSk">here is a good documentary showing you more prove</a></p>
<p>Edward Jenner was an s.J.-a Slick Jesuit-who taught the medical world how to use the POISONED NEEDLE. He was the first to associate human diseases with that of animals. This idea paved the way for pollution which is responsible for the deaths of multiplied millions of people around the world. The idea that humans and animals are related and share the same diseases led to the theory of evilution which is responsible for the spiritual death of multiplied millions more.In the countryside in Gloucestershire, England, where Jenner lived, the farmers had a legend or superstition that catching cowpox (a disease of cows which was transferred to the cows' udders by unwashed or bleeding hands) would act like a charm or amulet to make them immune from catching the human disease of smallpox. Medicine man Jenner took this local legend or old wives' tale and turned it into a scientific FACT.</p>

        <p>Because the people are brain washed by the media and my prove was coming from the CDC its not fake, the <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/about">center for health security</a> came out and talked about event 201 the same time "coronavirus" Got out event 201 is coronavirus because event 201 is a global pandemic exercise, coronavirus is an exercise thats all it is, guess who funded this exercise, bill and Melinda Gates, now guess whose funding the world Health organization, Bill and Melinda gates, coincidence i think not, bill gates is pushing the vaccines is that also coincides? , bill is the founder of Microsoft why is he funding all of this and why is he pushing the vaccines he doesn't even have a medical degree hes not a doctor. </p>
<p>The second-largest funder is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which provides 9.8% of the WHO's funds.<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/who-funds-world-health-organization-un-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-trump/">click</a> </p>
<p>All of these organizations are in it together, they are trying to kill us all believe it or not the rest is left to you to do the research i have given you some points there is no way i can convince you, you have to come to the realization by your self.</p>
