    <strong>Just got banned from a subreddit I never even used, knew, or cared about for commenting in this subreddit.</strong>
    <p><p>r/tifu sent me a message saying I was permanently banned and the only way I can get back into that subreddit is to promise that I would not use this subreddit anymore as if I am some child. Is this really the current state of affairs? Seems like a joke or a nightmare. But the thing is I really don't give a damn about that subreddit so they can have their ban.</p>
<p>Edit: The bans just keep rolling in as I was just banned from r/mademesmile. I wonder which one will be next. Can't wait!
r/HolUp was next. Again, what even is that subreddit!? It has to be a joke at this point.</p></p>

        <p>This is all you need to know about the future censorship. People will start digitally disappearing. 
If a tree falls in the woods does it make a sound?
If a person disappears from your electronic world we’re they erased or did that person decide to log off? </p>
<p>Remember it all started with Alex Jones and then once they knew they could do that they kept doing this up past a President! A President! 
What do you think they will do to the local parents whose kids are f’d up over this mass experiment ?</p>

        <p>Yeah it is quite scary inside when you really see the way things are going and I know this will be the start of a socialist, fascist, Marxist Society. Man, I just really want to find some place where none of this matters.</p>

        <p>Yeah it is quite ridiculous and it makes no sense how these subreddits that I have never even used or care about somehow find out about me using a subreddit that has nothing to do with them. Like what is there steak in it and why does it concern them so much that they have to ban someone just because they made one comment here or something!? I could have just been a guy passing through and making a comment that was to their liking, not that I care, but there are some major questions that should be answered here pertaining to this.</p>

        <p>Is just super ridiculous how people can get banned for commenting here a first time without even knowing the implications and it's just like people can't have options or make choices or use their free will or they risk getting silenced in other facets or areas of the internet. They are silencing people and minimalizing their options and free thinking. I could have something to add in this subreddit and their Sabrett it's but they don't want to risk having someone that thinks outside of the narrow box that they are in. That's just my two cents on it though.</p>

        <p>The bot will ban you again and the same sentence will unban you.    You can choose to “give in to it” or you can accept the ban.   Doesn’t matter to me.  But this sub is filled with people complaining about being banned from random subs.  So it’s obviously bothering some of you.   </p>
<p>Personally I like to watch the message chain grow with all the times I’ve been permanently banned from a sub only to be reinstated an hour later.</p>

        <p>Yeah the only thing that bothers me is the fact of how ridiculous it is but all of the subreddits I have been banned from I really don't give a damn about and really didn't even know I was subbed to them. But that is interesting to know.</p>
