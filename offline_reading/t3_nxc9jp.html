        <p>Ok, so if I get sick it’s just a coincidence? Or from “environmental toxins” or something? Sorry but I don’t buy that. </p>
<p>I’m really against all this covid restriction stuff and a rushed experimental vaccine but I believe viruses and bacterial infections exist.</p>

        <p>Based on what your told... I'm still reading through the article but at the very least it is plausible and the fact that the creator of germ theory said it was false should have us asking more questions, not reaffirming our 'beliefs'</p>

<p>Even if that's true, it's entirely irrelevant. Just because he pioneered an idea doesn't mean he's infallible. Many scientists have questioned their own work and thought they were wrong. Often it's only after they're dead that more information is found. </p>
<p>If it's so fake why can a person get anthrax and kill someone with it..</p>

        <p>Saying thats irrelevant may be your opinion but most people would probably disagree with you. I happen to think it at the very least warrants skepticism, aka asking questions aka part of what makes science science in the first place. Here is an article with various citations of studies showing flu transmission to not have been provable or replicatable https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/studies-question-transmission-1918-spanish-flu#_edn3</p>
<p>As to your point about anthrax, it is a bacteria that is deadly to animals... which doesn't have much to do with this discussions about viruses and their nature/transmissibility.</p>

<p>yep, and you have zero evidence to prove it. do you have him on tape saying that? no? oh well, good thing no human would ever lie. convenient that he didn't write it down. </p>
<p>so even if he said it, do you understand that as you die, your brain shuts down? why would that be the most reliable thing someone says? this is no different than the many 'death bed conversions' of people critical of the church.</p>
<p>by the way, on bechamps deathbed he said he was wrong and pasteur was right. trust me.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;Pasteur's strength diminished day by day, he now could hardly walk. When he was seated in the Park, his grandchildren around him suggested young rose trees climbing around the trunk of a dying oak. The paralysis was increasing, and speech was becoming more and more difficult. The eyes alone remained bright and clear; Pasteur was witnessing the ruin of what in him was perishable.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;How willingly they would have given a moment of their lives to prolong his, those thousands of human beings whose existence had been saved by his methods; sick children, women in lying-in hospitals, patients operated on in surgical wards, victims of rabid dogs saved from hydrophobia, and so many others protected against the infinitesimally small! But, whilst visions of those living beings passed through the minds of his family, it seemed as if Pasteur already saw those dead ones who, like him, had preserved absolute faith in the Future Life.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;The last week in September he was no longer strong enough to leave his bed, his weakness was extreme. On September 27, as he was offered a cup of milk: "I cannot," he murmured; his eyes looked around him with an unspeakable expression of resignation, love and farewell. His head fell back on the pillows and he slept; but, after this delusive rest, suddenly came the gaspings of agony. For twenty-four hours he remained motionless, his eyes closed, his body almost entirely paralyzed; one of his hands rested in that of Mme. Pasteur, the other held a crucifix.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;This, surrounded by his family and disciples, in this room of almost monastic simplicity, on Saturday, September 28, 1895, at 4:40 in the afternoon, very peacefully, he passed away.</p>
<p>&rt;1926 English translation of The Life of Pasteur by René Vallery-Radot, first published in 1900. Vallery-Radot was Pasteur's son-in-law, and therefore much more likely to have been there during Pasteur's final hours than some other anonymous biographer or someone who waited until 44 years after Pasteur's death to write a hagiography of one of his rivals (now forgotten except by quackery supporters).</p>
<p>interesting.</p>
<p>&rt;As to your point about anthrax, it is a bacteria that is deadly to animals... which doesn't have much to do with this discussions about viruses and their nature/transmissibility.</p>
<p>yes, it does. because you deny GERM theory, of which BACTERIA are a germ. so congratulations, you both believe and deny germ theory.</p>
<p>and it's interesting that your 'greenmedinfo' website uses links to studies which talk about the existence of viruses and bacteria. and the strongest evidence they have is from 1919 and 1921. funny how when research is continued over the years there's more evidence. <a href="https://news.wisc.edu/content/uploads/2015/03/ebola-virus-1024x959.jpg">found a virus</a> </p>
<p>in any case, if that's your evidence, then you've got a long way to go to prove anything. it's not even remotely convincing.</p>

        <p>You don’t by that, but you buy getting sick from flying invisible zombie unicorn bugs? Even though there is absolutely zero evidence to support the absolutely absurd pseudoscience of the germ theory? Haven’t you wondered why it’s still just a theory? That alone should give you pause. </p>
<p>One last question…..Did it hurt when they brainwashed you?</p>

<p>This is just a lie. If you actually have an argument make it. There's far more evidence in favour than against. </p>
<p>Why not be honest and present the evidence for your position? </p>
<p>So what is anthrax then?</p>
