    <strong>Reddit will never ban this page</strong>
    <p><p>I see every now and again someone pipes up about this page possibly getting banned and there’s a few subs dedicated to banning us. </p>
<p>I don’t think it’s going to happen or it already would have. </p>
<p>If anyone in charge of reddit with any power was legitimately for lockdowns and believed the covid lies, they would see this sub as an outrageous attack of people’s health and wild misinformation and ban it immediately. They haven’t. It’s been around a while and the blokes in charge of reddit would’ve gone through this sub by now and banned it ages ago if they were ever going to. </p>
<p>It seems like we’re here to stay :)</p></p>
