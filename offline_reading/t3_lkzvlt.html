    <strong>my brother makes me wanna puke.</strong>
    <p><p>"Whether or not this pandemic is real or escalated or whatever,  people are still dying; the majority of them being the elderly  population and those with compromised health. Sure, some of them are  already very sick and this flu is going to push them over the edge but  the fact of the matter is that deaths will still occur and this makes me  sad- especially those that are preventable. This flu has over a 1%  mortality rate , which if you look at the world, that's a minimum of  77million people who will potentially die. This could be any one of us  or our loved ones.</p>
<p>So I challenge you to look inwards at your  own humanitarianism and take pride when you put your mask on. You could  be saving a life when you do. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, is 12 sq inches of fabric really worth all the fuss?"</p>
<p>Oh wow, old people dying makes him sad. What a unique and gifted heart he has.</p>
<p>And that last part - "it's only..."  or "it's just..."  what these people don't realize is that by saying something, for example, the mask,  is "merely" 12 square inches (so what's the big deal) - I can make the exact same argument, against the mask. It's only 12 square inches of fabric <em>not</em> on my face. What's the big deal? Is it worth making a fuss that someone <em>isn't</em> wearing such a small cloth on their face? I mean, it's only 12 square inches. And for fuck sakes, didn't we make it this far without them?</p></p>

<p>It's only ______ for <em>that</em> person.  Not everyone.  </p>
<p>It was losing his business for that guy, or not being able to see your mother for that woman.  </p>
<p>For <em>you</em> it's "only" wearing a mask.  For other people, it was their lives.  </p>
<p>The arrogance of assuming everyone had to sacrifice the same amount is staggering.</p>
