    <strong>I Love Yall</strong>
    <p><p>This has easily been the Worse time in my life Ever. In the start of all this i was actually sort of a Doomer whenever I saw somebody without a mask or having a lot of people around one area i looked at them with Anger. I also don't know why for the life of me I Watched CNN and Andrew Cuomo Briefings Daily (I Live in NY) and I listened to Everything they said to do. Around May though is when it changed for me as you know the BLM protests started to Erupt everywhere and I'm thinking to Myself this cant go well for the spread right? Well i saw little to No pushback from Political figure's  or even other Super Doomers I knew and I'm like Wait Hold on Wtf. You close Basketball Courts (I'm a superfan of basketball and play any chance I get) and basically every thing else and say its for our Safety But aren't even affected over the mass gatherings in the Streets. And we know Overweight and obese people obviously have a harder time breathing and we know Covid is Upper respiratory so shouldn't we be Promoting Exercise and Vitamin D Exposure (Since we see having Vitamin D Helps you fight it). And whenever i would say this People would say I'm Fatshaming???? Like I'm sorry I take care of my Body and I'm trying to help Find solutions instead of these forced Lockdowns that are never ending. I don't wanna sit on my ass for months ordering Uber Eats and watching Movies and posting selfies with my mask on with the Hashtag ''Saving Life's''. So basically i was fighting this alone so I decided to Look around Reddit to find other people like me and i Eventually found this Sub, LS and CVCJ and I'm like these People Fucking Get It! My sanity was starting to slip from C19 and it really improved when I found other people like me so I thank yall I don't post Super Heavy on reddit but I felt like I had to express myself. I hope yall had a Good Thanksgiving Bless Ya'll fr</p></p>

        <p>BLM protests, Covid-1984, and taking away your right to play basketball are all tools of the communist global agenda. It's all connected. </p>
<p>Wake up anyone who will listen about the fake woke left and their games. Saddest population of people on the planet, they get used everyday and actually fight for corporately sponsored terrorism, and have zero clue it's happening to them. </p>
<p>Your future depends on it.</p>

        <p>You know I'm not really into conspiracy that heavy but your making alot of sense we are being used And most of this generation just bends over backwards and takes orders like we gotta be smarter than this of course the media is gonna install fear That's what they want is for u to sit at home and watch their network so they get paid and laugh off restrictions Such as Chris Cuomo with the no mask in the barbershop or even when he got in a fight with a guy for him being exposed Your right man</p>

        <p>The globalist communist agenda isn't a conspiracy. Not even close. It has worked several times over in history in the almost exact way it is today in the United States of fucking America! You're in stage three right now. There are only 4 stages. </p>
<p>High level defectors from communism have been trying to tell you how it works for decades. The majority chooses not to listen. Trump, although unwittingly, played his part to perfection. He got the United States to clamor for status quo politics that has always been about globalism. Now the REAL squeeze can start. </p>
<p>If you can't see it, you're still in the fog of perceived freedom, and the fog of living in a republic that is just a few short years away from not existing. </p>
<p>The republic loving right is the new counter culture.</p>
<p>Choose carefully.</p>

        <p>When people hear communism, they think soviet union, gulags etc. But when we say communists we mean leftists in general. Just look at what the left has been doing these last few years and you'll be able to realize their endgame.</p>
