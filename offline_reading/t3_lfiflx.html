    <strong>As someone who did get COVID, I know now why people are protesting.</strong>
    <p><p>First off, I am a 26-year-old who lives alone in my apartment, but my 52-year-old smoking father and my 23-year-old sister who lives with my dad all got it after me. (No, they did not get COVID from me.)</p>
<p>When I got a positive test result I was scared. I read stories about "Covid 19 Long-Haul" and how people who got it in march is still feeling symptoms in December. (When I got it). I quarantined, blah blah blah but interestingly enough it felt like the flu. I didn't get brain fog, I didn't experience shortness of breath, I just experienced your average cold symptoms. I got another test and it came back positive as I was skeptical if it really was covid. Symptoms cleared in about 4 days and I quarantined for 1 week and took a test and it came back negative. I then realized that the lockdowns, the mask-wearing, its all bullcrap. It was a mild cold, and to the fearmongers who make people think that healthy 20-30 young people can die of COVID, screw you.</p>
<p>My dad's experience though was still mild. He described it as fatigue, shortness of breath, and your average flu symptoms. He did not die, he was never hospitalized and it was basically a mild flu. </p>
<p>After I experienced COVID first hand now I know why people are making fun of the people who are pro-lockdowns, or r/NoNoNewNormal. Half of the people who complain about covid and say it's a deadly virus probably never got it, and to the r/covidlonghaulers, I pray for you all but I highly doubt there are 10 thousand people who have gotten covid and have symptoms for months. Covid is not that serious.</p></p>

        <p>I had it, it sucked, wasn't the end of the world but it wasn't a pleasant few weeks. No way in hell would I ever suggest though that my shitty experience with it is enough to warrant shutting down everyone else's lives. The problem is these people think they are the center of the universe.</p>

        <p>I mean it‚Äôs kinda what the other guy said but I‚Äôll try n put it in nicer terms. </p>
<p>you were being kinda self-centered while trying to call out ‚Äúthese people‚Äù as self centered . You got covid and luckily didn‚Äôt get the worst of it, as most people do. You then try and use that self-centered evidence to say that it‚Äôs ‚Äúno biggie‚Äù when really recovering is the <em>expected</em> result, even for a so called ‚Äúdoomer‚Äù lol. I really am glad it wasn‚Äôt that bad for you. but Yeah i do also hope you understand not everyone who disagrees (like me!) is self centered. Just like how even though it sounded ironic, I don‚Äôt think you are actually self centered. üòä</p>

        <p>You are being self centered. That comment is only ironic if you have no empathy and can't see that things look different from other perspectives. There is no irony in that comment for us because we are not part of your cult.</p>
<p>Only very unhealthy people die from this pathetic virus that you have decided is OK to ruin everyone's life over.</p>
<p>Again, either you have no idea about empathy and how things look different depending what side you are on or you have no idea what irony is. Either way you are wrong and don't worry so much about being "nice" as you put it. I couldn't give a flying fuck about your emojis and attempts to be nice. You can be nice by reading more books about how elites don't care about you and how society can fall apart much faster than you might expect.</p>
<p>There is no way that someone can have read a lot of literature and think that government mandated lockdowns or any rule that inhibits freedom is OK.</p>
<p>Also it wasn't me who wrote the original comment. Pay attention.</p>

        <p>These stories are always anecdotal, but here goes:</p>
<p>People in my life who got Covid-19:</p>
<ul>
<li>My wife's best friend. She's 40 and obese. She had cold like symptoms and was a little tired for about a weekend. That's all.</li>
<li>A close friend in the Netherlands -- his mom got it. She had flulike symptoms and was out of work for about 10 days. No hospitalization, just didn't feel well. She's all better now. No hospitalization, etc.</li>
<li>My closest friend, who has had to move in with his wife's grandparents due to a financial situation. -- His grandparents both got it. They are 89 and 90. Even I was worried about them! But... after about 14 days of flulike symptoms, they were better. The grandmother got cramps that were bad enough that she cried, apparently. But no hospitalization, all good now.</li>
</ul>
<p>People in my life who died during the lockdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>My friend at work killed himself unexpectedly. This guy had everything going for him. Quite literally I envied his life. His house, his money, the respect he had at work. Even his height &amp; looks. I still don't understand it. His children found him, hanging in the garage.</li>
<li>My friend's sister killed herself. She was a schoolteacher with no history of mental issues.</li>
<li>I live in my mother-in-law's house now because she died during the lockdown. Her social circle closed off to her, and she was too scared to fly out to see us. We crossed country several times to try to help her, and even had plane tickets for her after she finally agreed to come stay with us... But the fear and loneliness, I believe, sped up her death.</li>
</ul>
<p>What many people don't know is there was a world-wide population explosion 75 years ago. This went on for 20 years. The oldest and most unhealthy of those people are dying now. There's also a higher percentage of old people in the population now, so the deaths-per-thousand is expectedly pushed to higher levels (about the same as deaths in 1993 and every year before 1979.)</p>
<p>For the quick-to-downvote doomers, just look at what happened to population in 1946. Births jump from 1.4m to 2.7m in a single year and it doesn't stop for 20 years.</p>
<p><a href="http://demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm">http://demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm</a> </p>
<p>And... the population growth wasn't limited to USA:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-twentieth_century_baby_boom">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-twentieth_century_baby_boom</a> </p>

        <p>As someone who at 10 years old,  found my father after his suicide, I can concur with this statement. It's an image that will be burned into their brains for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>Don't do it to your kids or family in general, but especially don't let that be the last image they have of you and the one that pops into their minds first every single time they think of you.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the kind words. I have a wife and 4 kids so that keeps me going, but TBH if it wasn't for them I'm not sure I could find the motivation to carry on.</p>
<p>Any optimism I had about things ever getting better is quickly fading -- let's be real here, hope faded a long time ago.</p>
<p>It's quite clear that the people will go along with anything asked of them in the name of Covid emergency measures. Literally anything. Say it's for "sustainability" or "equality" or to "save lives" and no matter how terrible it is, they'll give up their freedoms for it.</p>
<p>And then they'll hate you, call you selfish, and wish death on you if you so much as question it.</p>
<p>These are impossibly dark times.</p>

<p>Humanity collectively decided to create a world that has no place for someone like me and I will not put kids through this ordeal. Finding it difficult to find any reason to continue. Very tempting to leave the idiots in the mess they made and nope out.</p>

        <p>I hear you.  I have a toddler myself and every day go back and forth between brief feelings of optimism for his future and dread of what potentially lies ahead for him.  But, children ARE the future, as corny as that is, and all we can really do is raise them better than the children before them were raised and hope things turn out better.  Take care.</p>

        <p>I definitely agree. Lockdown is a terrible thing and COVID is not worth all the mental health issues that make lockdown happen. I don't think we can stay in "quarantine" for longer, if we stay for another year like what Dr. Falsely is saying then I think that is how revolutions and violent people are made.</p>
<p>Most of everyone who I know has gotten flulike symptoms with a shortness of breath if their older. Lockdown is never worth it especially with a virus with a 99.97 survival rate.</p>

        <p>I actually had a pretty bad case of it back in January,  and I am a pretty healthy male in my everyday life (I am also 28). I was super lethargic and had a pronounced cough; I basically was immobile for a week and a half.</p>

        <p>We have a relative who's died from it, he was in his 80s.  Our friend's granddaughter got it, and she seems to have recovered with no lasting effects so far, she's in her early 20s.  A friend of our neighbor's got it, she's in her late teens:  She fell into a coma/eventually came out of it, and recovered from Covid, but lost her pancreas.  And she has no other existing conditions that they could find.</p>
<p>So I don't doubt that the virus is real, and can be severe for some people, both young and old.  At the same time, however, I don't believe everything we're being told.  What I believe is that both sides are right and wrong about different things.  I just haven't figured out exactly what's what yet.  Maybe I never will.</p>

        <p>The idea that Covid can cause lasting effects isn't some kind of bizarre foreign concept. <br>
People commonly suffer lasting effects from just having had the flu or a cold, or any other number of infections and diseases.  So while I suspect that not everything we're being told is true, the idea that Covid can cause lasting effects, just like other viruses can, isn't one of the things that sets off any alarms in my head.</p>

        <p>I agree about the likelihood of long term effects and how it's the same with the flu.</p>
<p>However, I bet you've never said "he recovered from the flu and has no lasting effects so far" right? Because that just wasn't in our consciouness before because it is so rare and only applies to people who have other issues anyway.</p>
<p>So why are you putting that here? That is my point. You have changed the way you talk about illness because of a powerfull propaganda campaign and I will continue to call this out. I met two people who claim to lasting effects and they are both depressed hypochonriacs who look for anything to complaing about.</p>
<p>Good for you for being on the right side about this but we're all brainwashed to some extent. It doesn't hurt to point it out.</p>

        <p>Being on the right side?  I don't think I'm on either side, really.  What I suspect is that both sides have gotten some things right, and that both sides are also dangerously mistaken about some other things.  So if I were to fully commit myself to either, then I'd be consenting either way to being misled to some extent.  What feels right for me is hearing what everyone has to say, and collecting the good information for myself along the way.</p>
<p>And then as a cancer survivor, I've been accustomed for a long time to thinking in terms of future effects resulting from disease.  Added to that, where Covid is concerned, I hear some people claiming that it doesn't even exist, and I know that's not true.  So I'm not going to just blindly believe someone who wants to tell me that the possibility of long-term effects doesn't exist either.  So, no, I don't believe I'm being brainwashed.  I'm just thinking for myself, and there are people on both sides who seem to not like that.</p>

        <p>The cancer thing makes a lot of sense as to why you would approach the topic like that but I think you are purposefully avoiding the fact that you said "no lasting effects" when you would never have said that for someone who recovered from flu.</p>
<p>That was my main point. We have all been propagandised in some way and you buying into the "long illness" hype is part of that.</p>
<p>Like you said sometimes people have long term effects from flu but nobody mentions when someone doesn't have that because that is the norm. That also applies here.</p>

        <p>People do talk about the long term effects of having had the flu or a cold:  People complain about the fatigue that can linger after a flu is gone, the annoying cough that won't go away after they've gotten over a cold, etc.  Maybe it just doesn't stand out, because in those cases we aren't talking about potentially life-threatening effects.</p>

<p>We aren't here either unless we are talking about extremely frail people. Pretty much the same as flu. Almost as if they just rebranded flu. Which is exactly what they did and exactly why there hasn't been any flu deaths since March. </p>
<p>I've never heard anyone talk about someone who recovered from flu saying he is lucky because he doesn't have any long term effects. Pretty sure you wouldn't have said that either without being influence by the bullshit of last year, that was my only point and you can't see to accept it. </p>
<p>Good luck to you on your journey of awakening. Spoiler: It's one big fucking scam which most people are too scared to wrap their head around.</p>

And then because I'm not willing to blindly believe you, you finish by hitting me with a condescending insult that I must not be awake.  And I don't care about that.

        <p>Covid long haulers sure do sound like people trying to fit their symptoms into "covid long haul" symptoms. Hypochondriacs converge!. Some people actually got depression from this "new normal" state we live. And yes flu or bacterial infections can fuck up your neurological system too...</p>

        <p>By now, all of us know waaaaaayyyyyy more people who got it, either with or without symptoms, and recovered.

        <p>Covid ‚Äúlong-haulers‚Äù tend to complain predominantly of fatigue, brain fog, and difficulty concentrating. </p>
<p>These are all things caused by a lack of exercise and social activity. They are also separately caused by depression and anxiety (both of which are correlated and/or often causally related with lack of exercise and social isolation).  </p>
<p>Finally, consider that these exact ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù are currently occurring with greater than usual frequency in the normal, never-had-covid population... because it turns out that having your life put on hold, getting no physical activity for months on end, and being socially isolated comes with negative consequences. </p>
<p>In sum: there is no evidence that ‚Äúlong-haul‚Äù Covid is a thing (in that it is significantly different from the lingering effects that occur with all respiratory illnesses such as the flu).</p>

        <p>I think I've had <strong>brain fog</strong> and <strong>difficulty concentrating</strong> since March or April 2020. I use all the free time I don't spend commuting anymore to exercise more, so I'm <strong>always tired</strong> and I've had multiple sports injuries crop up this year (and went from a really nice standing desk setup to a laptop on the couch--great for the neck and back, lol), which means I constantly have <strong>aches and pains</strong>, and basically a <strong>headache</strong> every other day because it turns out looking at screens for 16 hours a day is not healthy for anyone.</p>

I think underplaying how terrible covid can be will make us look uneducated or pretending not to see the truth. While I had it I needed an IV drip for hydration and to steady my heart beat. I'm only 28 and healthy af, I can run 5 miles no problem. Almost everyone I knew got a mild case but I had to be the unlucky one and nearly die lmao.</p>

        <p>The media might use some anecdotal evidence to make a point, but they're not trying to prove a point, they're trying to make people feel emotion so they keep tuning in. As for the people actually recommending lockdowns, school closures, and masks, they're relying on scientific studies. I can pull some up if you'd like.</p>

<p>It'll be hysterically funny, in a sad way, when half the mega-doomers that have been walking around inside beachballs and what have you get wiped out by the next regular cold season because their immune systems atrophied completely.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I find a YouTube video of a conference talk that‚Äôs just too quiet. Even when it‚Äôs set to maximum volume, with Windows set to maximum volume, it‚Äôs still too quiet. </p>
<p>First, open your web browser‚Äôs JavaScript console. In Chrome, click on the menu button, then ‚Äòmore tools‚Äô, then ‚ÄòDeveloper Tools‚Äô to open the developer tools.</p>
<p>In the Developer Tools, click on the <em>Console</em> tab.</p>
<p>Click in the empty white space after the &rt; symbol. Now you can type or paste code into the console.</p>
<p>Copy this code and paste it into the console.</p>

        <p>You could have come to this conclusion without getting it by using your brain.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt worth praising we don‚Äôt need a society of people who can only change their mind about something if it happens directly to them. We need people that can use their brain and not give into fear and propaganda. This person did neither and they will fall for the next scam. Fuck everyone who allowed this to happen. We need to be blunt and clear with these people. </p>
<p>I basically just read: ‚ÄúI thought Tyranny was acceptable until I got Covid and it wasn‚Äôt that bad for me‚Äù. It‚Äôs selfish and stupid and helped to get us where we are now.</p>
<p>I bet you got tested loads too adding to the case numbers which keep us locked up. Are you waiting for experimental injections too honestly fuck these people.</p>

        <p>Myself and my spouse got the flu last March. My spouse got sick last week and couldn't shake it off. Milder symptoms than our flu, but tested negative for Covid. But, man, he's got asthma so all the hype, had me scared during some of it. Nearly a solid year of the media cramming it down your throats about how scary it is... Still affected me. Even when I know they hyped up the dangers and lied about the numbers of deaths. I need to stay away from social media... Bleh!</p>

        <p>The vast majority of people in your age range that get it have, reportedly, about the same experience as you. Most are over it within a few days of diagnosis. It typically doesn't get remotely problematic or gingers until you get into the 65+ range, and even then not really severe until 78+.</p>

        <p>The only person I know who identifies as a "long-hauler" was a raging hypochondriac before Covid. She was always in and out of the hospital for things like "dizzy spells" from not eating and on massive amounts of counter-indicating drugs and anxiety pills she conned many different doctors into giving her. Now she's on even MORE drugs and complains of "brain fog," go figure. Everyone else I know who had it had mild symptoms if any.</p>

        <p>I can explain it. It affects everyone differently. Covid can show no symptoms in a 116 year old nun but can put a healthy 21 year old on the ventilator and have lung problems for years. I'm not saying that they don't exist, I am simply doubting the fact that there are thousands of them and that 10% of Covid patients are long haulers.</p>
<p>BTW, with every virus there is a chance of long symptoms. That's simple viruses for you bud.</p>

        <p>Good for you, your father and your sister.</p>
<p>The fact is however that for people over 50, CoVid-19 is 5% lethal... maybe even more considering that CoVid-19 infection rates are exaggerated by inaccurate PCR tests being used for diagnosis purposes, a purpose they were not ever meant to be used for.</p>
<p>That is scary in the real world. Why? Because CoVid-19 being even 5% lethal in those above 50 years of age marks it as the most lethal coronavirus in that age group in the past 120 years, including the 1918 pandemic flu.</p>
<p>For the average person under 50, it is a non-issue with a 99.97% survival rate.</p>
<p>For those over 50? Uh... no. It is something that you should really be concerned about, especially if you have one or more of those exceptionally common pre-ex's.</p>
<p>That said the lockdowns and masking requirements for everyone are not necessary in my opinion and even violate human rights.</p>

        <p>I got into a motorcycle accident on the freeway and and walked away with just a fractured arm. Motorcycle accidents are not that serious.</p>
<p>If you're a young, healthy person there is a 99.8% chance you'll survive, with the worst you'll see being some mild symptoms along with a weakened sense of taste if you're unlucky. When you spread it and it makes its way over to grandma or your weak cousin with the asthma, that's when it becomes an issue. Are you autistic, or just selfish?</p>

        <p>Actually once you pass a certain age, most states put restrictions in place to make keeping a driver's license more dfficult for seniors. It protects both them and us. </p>

        <p>Bad logic. Freeways are less important for daily life than dive bars for you to pick up toothless redneck chicks at. Correct logic:</p>
<p>Obviously we need to create straightforward rules to make motorcycling safer, including helmet laws and mandatory safety courses.</p>
<p>Oh wait, we already do, because sometimes straightforward legislation can help more than it hurts.</p>
<p>The entire world is taking covid seriously. Some countries are already done with it after taking it seriously. This doesn't have to be a political issue. Why are you stupid enough to let a bunch of old rich dudes convince you that it is?</p>

        <p>Did you know that telling your insurance company that you ride a motorcycle makes life insurance premiums cost twice as much? (But I like the point your making here, one person with a feel good story doesn't matter when it comes to the overall statistics.)</p>
<p>Now most of the people here know 1 or 2 people who had covid. If covid has a 1% death rate they need to know about a 100 people with covid to see the actual statistics that scientists study. Thats hard to find for your average Joe. Makes it feel less real. </p>
<p>They say you need 70% of a population to get herd immunity. Florida had a population of 21.48 million people in 2019. .. multiple that by 70% and you need roughly 15 million people in Florida to catch covid this year to help with herd immunity (or get vacinated that helps too). A 1% death rate gives you 150,036 deaths in a year. </p>
<p>In 2018 Florida had 3,091 deaths attributed to the flu.</p>
<p>So far in between 2020-21... Florida has had 27,822 deaths out of 1,783,720 cases of covid ...thats a death rate of 1.55%. Adjust the numbers.... 1.55% of 70% of the population will die to help get us back to normal thats....233,058 people.</p>
<p>In 2019 st. Petersburg Florida had a population of 261,388. If all but 30,000 of this city in Florida die... the state of Florida will have successfully achieved herd immunity. </p>
<p>That is of course if herd immunity can be reached at 70%. Measles requires closer to a 95%vaccination rate to be successfully suppressed.</p>
<p>Ps. Those on the autism spectrum are often quite gifted with math. It is more likely that posters on this thread are trying their best to gather a sample size of at least 100 cases, while not fully understanding what a non-biased study is.</p>

        <p>It's just interesting to see these anecdotes because the ones we see in the media are always terrible. We are led to believe that covid is a death sentence for everyone which makes people terrified, so it's good to see the other side for once.</p>

        <p>True. In Florida 95% of Covid deaths were in the 55 and over population. And only 1.57% of people who caught covid in Florida died.  Out of 600 random friends who catch covid, only 9 will die. (And 8.5 of them will be over 55 so they had a good run anyway.)</p>
<p>It is pretty comforting way to look at it. And in this thread you can hear stories from all those 591 friends who did just fine.</p>

        <p>Electrician is even easier. Just watch ElectroBOOM for a day and you are good to go.</p>
<p>The fact is that most don't die. Most get only a little sick. Some get very sick for days and 3 in 1000 dies unless you are already half dead. But with this new cool lockdown, maybe we can kill 4 in 1000 even without the infection. Kill more to save lives.</p>

        <p>Where does the 3 in a 1,000 statistic come from? Florida is at 1.57 people dead per hundred that catch it? (Today) and jan 6th was at 1.45 deaths per hundred covid cases.</p>
<p>(Florida statistics are an easy search- they have decent reporting)</p>

        <p>So which state would be a better basis of comparison? Which state was your 3 in a 1,000 number based on?</p>
<p>Edit - state of Oregon at 1.389 deaths per 100 covid cases. Not as bad as Florida, but still nowhere near your stat? I picked OR as the state with smallest number of covid deaths so far.</p>
