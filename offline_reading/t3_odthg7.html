    <strong>Here's my story.</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone.
So in November 2019 I got a text from my mom that said "you should buy N65 masks, goggles and gloves there is a virus and it might get bad." </p>
<p>So I messaged my husband and he went out and bought them.</p>
<p>I was at work at the time so I told my boss and he laughed hysterically and said I was crazy etc..</p>
<p>Fast forward to early March 2020.
Lockdowns ensued and I was terrified!</p>
<p>People dropping dead
Monkeys in Thailand going crazy because no tourists.
I wore a mask.
Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>Come the end of March and in my provide one of the restrictions was "no fishing, no bonfires"
Now. I live on a lake. 
If I want to walk out of my back door and throw a line I'm going to do it.
That's when the lightbulb turned on.
That's when I woke up.</p>
<p>So I'll admit it.
They had me at first, but now I'm looking at everyone like their crazy.</p>
<p>What was it that woke you up?</p></p>

        <p>As soon as lockdown started, I knew it was going to kill more people than a virus would. Even if the lockdown was only "2 weeks to flatten the curve."</p>

        <p>I took it seriously at first, too. I even kind of wrote off Fauci flip flopping on masks because I thought “well, we probably learned something new about this virus”. </p>
<p>I woke up during the George Floyd protests when it was apparently okay for thousands of BLM protestors to gather in the streets. I was like “this makes zero sense”.</p>

        <p>I knew I couldn’t handle full lockdown. I knew it would kill me anyway. So I broke rules from the start. Not major rules just rules that had to be amended to suit people like me anyway. I knew the government was wrong so I went against it.</p>
