    <strong>In a video posted on YouTube Tuesday, Fr. Daniel Nolan told Catholics “do not obey the bishop, do not obey the governor. They cannot tell you to wear a mask. This is a lie. They are lying to all of us.”</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://catholicmasses.org/church-officials-evaluating-priest-who-told-catholics-to-disobey-bishop-on-mask-wearing/">https://catholicmasses.org/church-officials-evaluating-priest-who-told-catholics-to-disobey-bishop-on-mask-wearing/</a></p>
<p>“If your bishop tells you, don’t do it. And I encourage everybody not to wear a mask. And I am telling you: disobey your bishop, disobey your governor. That’s what I’m telling you,” Nolan added.</p>
<p>His remarks came at the conclusion of a catechetical session offered at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish in Littleton, Colorado, which posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, and took it down on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Asked about the importance of obedience, Nolan told parishioners that “we ought to obey God rather than man. And if the bishop tells you to do something that is contrary to your health, contrary to reason, and contrary to common good, disobey it. And it’s contrary to the common good to continue to go along with an attempted communist takeover of the United States, which is what’s happening.”</p>

        <p>The bishops lost the last little drop of credibility they still had when they cancelled Masses. They're a bunch of athiestic perverts and wannabe mafiosos who are only tough when beating down their own people. There's a toasty place in Hell waiting for them.</p>

        <p>The Vatican, a political machine, houses those who are busy shuffling priests around parishes to protect the pedophiles. They don't CARE about anyone. Money and power take precedence over people. Have you seen the cost of a Catholic education? Jesus wouldn't have worn a mask and regarded humanity as a huge blob of bacteria no matter what your faith or religion.</p>

<p>The video was apparently taken down within 24 hours, but at least someone within the church is defending its rights and its purpose in modern society amidst all this earthly madness. Is it a coincidence that organised religion has been shelved since before Easter, but Marxist demonstrations have been pretty much encouraged?</p>

        <p>There’s context missing for these comments that go further, the priest was talking specifically about masking and the vaccine, making the point that if we don’t fight masking right now, it will be much harder to fight against the forced vaccine. </p>

        <p>He’s right on that. Everyone defending these insane control grabs by governments claims the measures are so small, temporary, and for our own good ... they’ll never lead to anything else. </p>
<p>Except that is literally how it <em>always</em> happens. </p>
<p>A year ago, if you’d asked someone in Melbourne if the government could indefinitely confine them in their homes for 23 hours a day - or indefinitely prohibit people from seeing their parents - they would have laughed in your face and told you it’d never happen. Yet today, the government does exactly these things and everyone accepts it (many of them happily). </p>
<p>When you give up control, it’s not just nearly impossible to get it back - it also makes it that much easier to give up more control.</p>

        <p>From Fr. Nolan:</p>
<p>&rt;This incident has made me realize just how many people are on our side! Wherever you may be, realize that you are very much NOT alone in your belief that something is dreadfully wrong in the world today, and our Church leaders need to be standing up and saying something about it. You will find it encouraging to know that many of the messages of support I have received were from fellow priests, and even from one bishop! (Orthodox) </p>
<p>He emailed this morning to people who had reached out to express support for him and his speech against masking.</p>

        <p>Based but I wish people would stop going on about a communist takeover. It makes you look dumb.</p>
<p>What is communist about corporations ruling over us and governments being in their pockets? NOTHING.</p>
<p>This is what happens when a movement gets larger like ours is getting. It get's infiltrated by opponents who spread stupid ideas that I keep hearing like "communist takeover". It's designed to make us look stupid so we can be ignored. Don't fall for it.</p>
<p>Trump and Boris are as far from communism as you can get. Stop this stupidity.</p>

        <p>Trump has nothing to do with the swerve left. Governments play zero role in the deep state changes. In fact, it’s only in the countries with right wing governments that you see the most effective left wing coups taking place right now. Counterintuitive, but true.</p>

        <p>Antony Sutton’s work neatly explains how western capitalism and ‘communism’ (thesis and antithesis) work together to form our imminent synthesis.</p>
<p>Bolshevism was instigated, funded from the start and throughout its history in Russia and China by banking interests in the west, running it as an experiment in labour, production and political control. The intention was always to synthesise the two. 2020.</p>

        <p>Check out Sutton’s work. This is at least a century-old plan. The western banking interests also funded Hitler and Mussolini. They have no ideological allegiances, beyond consolidation of power. Mussolini called his brand of fascism ‘corporatism’, which best describes the current synthesis. When corporations control governments, it leads to totalitarianism. Fascism and communism are two seemingly opposing ways for the state and corporations to merge. Result the same. Total population enslavement. BLM is one strand of this process, but it dovetails with Sutton’s research pretty well.</p>
<p>Edit: Where communism once played upon the class wars, current iterations are playing on the race wars to divide and conquer us.</p>

        <p>So I know about what you are talking about already (just not Sutton). I know all about WWII and how it wasn't what we were taught it was. I also like how you are calling them "western banking interests" lol. </p>
<p>Regardless, I still don't see this as a communist takeover and don't get why now I'm suddenly seeing it everywhere. Yes it's a global agenda to control us (in a million different ways) and slow down freedom of movement and consolidate power. You say yourself "They have no ideological allegiences". You are right. I agree, ideologies are used to control us. They know that no one ideology can be useful for every situation. </p>
<p>Here's an example of how they use ideologies to control us: See a growing movement of people who see 2020 for what it is. Infiltrate them and start calling it a "communist takeover" when it has nothing to do with Karl Marx and his writings, because then, it'll be a lot easier for everyone else to go about their day knowing they can safely ignore us, because we are talking about irrelevant shit like communism instead of trying to get our rights back; something that everyone can relate to. See what I mean? I think we should try hard to stay on topic and leave ideologies out of this. Fuck, I don't care if communists are on our side as long as they are fighting against this faceless tyranny. </p>
<p>The fact my comment got 7 downvotes and no replys apart from you and I assume you didn't downvote just adds to my suspicions. </p>
<p>Can you honestly say this isnt the new Qanon thing because I don't know, I don't follow that but it stinks of Q.</p>

        <p>You make some excellent points here. </p>
<p>Not sure why people aren’t responding, only downvoting. Back in June, the race war was pretty intense here on Reddit and I guess many are wary about wading back into that swamp (including me!)</p>
<p>My issue is that BLM is self-admittedly Marxist (see Patrisse Cullers, for example). Yes, they appear to be fighting for a common cause of equal rights, but in my opinion that is simply the pretext for discrimination and further division. There is an open call for dismantling the police, most institutions in fact, the nuclear family, and affirmative action will be the focus. This will only fire up the opposition, who would normally be open to helping disadvantaged minorities. I don’t believe trained Marxists have black rights at heart either, but are using this genuine grievance for their own purposes. Find a weakness and exploit to advance ones own agenda. White guilt and fragility is only intended to inflame the majority and the protests/ riots at the moment in the US further this deliberate reactionary sentiment.</p>
<p>I’m not so au fait with Q, so am not sure how this dovetails with the Marxist agenda here. Seems to be mostly about secret swamp-cleaning amongst the pedophile elite, and not a genuine attempt to root out corruption and inequality. Maybe I’m wrong, but I’m not looking to any movement to solve our problems with revolutionary thinking. I believe the western world is now the closest it’s ever been to fair and equitable and we do not need to abolish all its tenets and institutions to advance this admirable cause. </p>
<p>Clearly we all want a more equal and fairer world, but many - including me - suspect the cures presented more than the diseases.   </p>
<p>I base my understanding on the current campaign against us all as a hybrid of Sutton and Bezmenov. That’s pretty much all one needs to know to appreciate the direction in which we’re heading.</p>

<p>This stuff was known ever since the Bolshevik revolution. But well documented first by Sutton. You're just behind the times.</p>
<p>Qanon is a pretty obvious fake. But all good fakes must carry an element of truth in order to be effective.</p>

        <p>There is no differenxe bw government (a corporation itself) and its corporate tentacles dependent on government &amp; federal privilege from it.  They are one in the same and all beneficiaries of the counterfeit money (via gov devaluation of actual working oeople's earnings) that the keneysian monetary system (communism, slavery) allows.   Capitalism requires sound money (freedom) like that defined in the US constitution which cant be counterfeited or inflated by any 3rd party/government.  It has not existed in your lifetime. </p>
