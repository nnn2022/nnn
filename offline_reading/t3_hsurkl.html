    <strong>I have a source who told me about government plans for more lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>Hi. I wanted to bring something to light that I heard from a source. I will say that this is from a reliable source though I can't speak to its accuracy since it is hearsay.</p>
<p>The source told me that several states will be locking down in the coming weeks into August. It will likely affect more than half of the United States. This new shutdown is being planned to last until the end of December. The election results will not affect the outcome. The new shutdown will make it so even fewer businesses are open and my source says that many states will be closing even the grocery stores, instead to give out food vouchers to people to use for online purchases. No one will be allowed to leave their homes except for medical care. They will announce steeper punishments for the people who disobey like jail time. </p>
<p>The vaccine, which my source claims is the Moderna one, will be ready by December and the US government knows this so they are stalling until then. When the vaccine is done, they plan to distribute it as soon as possible. It will be mandatory for all intents and purposes. </p>
<p>Masks will become permanent, this is why they keep saying it is a part of the new normal. They also plan rolling lockdowns for the future even without a pandemic going on. People are probably reading this and saying that makes no sense. It kind of doesn't but they are hoping this will decrease crime, disease and more societal problems. </p>
<p>My source speculated that the reason trillions went to big corporations is to act as "hush money" to keep these businesses from throwing a fit over the lockdown taking revenue from them. </p>
<p>I will not reply to anything else in this post. I may even delete this account soon. I am trying to help warn people of what to expect. Goodbye.</p></p>
