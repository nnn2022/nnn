    <strong>This is how they condition us not to search for information...</strong>
    <p><p>And it started many years ago.</p>
<p>Noticed search engines like google, yahoo and even duck duck go no longer provides you with accurate search results like pre 2010s? Instead no matter what you searched for you either get a YouTube link, amazon link or some news site, back then you could still scroll to 2nd or 3rd or 5th pages for more results, but nowadays they rarely go pass 2 pages before starting to show image results. And out of those result 90% arent related to what you searched for.</p>
<p>The reason they do this, apart from monetary gains from paying customers like shopping sites and obviously YouTube (whom google owns) and sites that reports favorable news, is to discourage people from searching useful info online and use these few sources as their source of information. The only way you can get useful search results is when you know which forum or website contains the info you need. But nowadays they are censoring out many websites, which is why lots of search result dont go over 2 pages.</p>
<p>I raised this issue about googles search engine years ago, folks were saying the same thing when they tried to get info for their researches. They recommend duck duck go, but i actually find ddg worse than google. All search engines trying to be smart nowadays and asking you if you were asking for this instead of that. Using "" command no longer works as as the ai ignores your request.</p>
<p>I think they planned this years ahead just to tackle "misinformation" and people being too smart as majority people now rely on internet to get their information. With the redirection of results to youtube and reddit, it makes information control much more convenient, as they can carry out censorship even more efficiently.</p>
<p>Also by doing so, it takes away traffic from other sites, sites usually rely on traffic for ad money, to keep the site running, by redirecting the traffic, they are basically starving many sites to death as everyone switches to say reddit. There are sites and forums that remained but facebook and reddit has taken away most of their traffics.</p>
<p>And when people are coerced into selected few websites, it makes it easier to censor uncooperative users, ban them and they now have no where to go unless they create an alt, which is easy to trace nowadays. So people start to be more compliant, and now you only see news and information the big brothers want you to.</p>
<p>If i say the internet is a thing of the pass, it wouldnt have been crazy 10 years ago. But when heavy censorship hits, you would have figure out its much easier to control the internet than reality when all the infrastructure on the internet is controlled by few tech giants.</p>
<p>What you gonna do when they shut down your internet and phone lines? Have you not witness what governments did in india when the riot started? I am surprised that china did not do this during the hong kong chaos.</p>
<p>But what are we doing? Do we have enough radio operators to keep information going when they finally decides to hit the off button? Are you ready with times without internet?</p>
<p>We will soon find out in 2023. Stay tuned.</p></p>

        <p>i don't know, i'm more of a PC user. So i get to scroll by pages. my phone browser on chrome  expands when i click "Show more results", so they are essential similar to pages.</p>
<p>i'm not talking about pre 2010 pages disappearing, i'm saying the search engines were doing great pre 2010, they show you what you are looking for, they are actually smart in a sense they know what you are asking, post 2010, the engines act like they trying be smart, even when you type a detailed search criteria it will assume most part of your search words are not important and just search based on what they deemed "key entries".</p>
<p>the only reason amazon shows up is because they paid google for this. hey if i were to search for shopping stuffs, i could click "Shopping" search? now it has gotten worse pretty much you get shown a side scrolling shopping items on top. but hey it's ok, i just skip to the 3rd search results skipping amazon and youtube. oh no how bout this shopping link or this 5 youtube links? it ends up with 3 results before i have to click "show more".</p>
<p>on a PC i can skip to the 5th page, not on mobile.</p>
<p>and no, i don't mean deep web, i just mean many small sites gets buried until it pretty much doesn't show up on google. instead you get multiple results from the same website, and i'm not talking about "search more on this website" feature.</p>
<p>i have not changed my search habits, and it is pretty simple and straight forward, but google wants to make it complicated. now i have to type more entries to find something general. they used to show quora or ask.com as top results, but now, 1st row would be shopping pages, followed by maybe few youtube links, then a row or Q&amp;A, and finally they start showing some results, which are pretty much links in those Q&amp;A list.</p>
<p>I have had this discussion on other subs and many agreed, but never have i though about censorship being a reason behind all this, we just though it was because how websites are manipulating their google search logic. but it is getting clearer nowadays. they don't want internet users to be too smart.</p>

        <p>I agree, but it would help if one could learn to use the multiple search features rather than a lazy search. At the very least use the -omit</p>
