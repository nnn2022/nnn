        <p>There have been no double blind RCT’s that show that the masks we are all required to wear, to put on little kids, stop viral transmission.</p>
<p>An April 2020 Cochrane review (preprint) found that face masks didn’t reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. (Source). https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2 An April 2020 review by the Norwich School of Medicine (preprint) found that “the evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks”, but supports the use of masks by “particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.” (Source). https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1 A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. (Source). https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577 An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. (Source). https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591</p>
<p>CDC Study Finds Overwhelming Majority Of People Getting Coronavirus Wore Masks https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf</p>

<p>"To our knowledge, only 1 randomized controlled trial has been conducted to examine the efficacy of cloth masks in healthcare settings, and the results do not favor use of cloth masks." https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-0948_article?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app</p>
<p>Here is the study</p>
<p>A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers (2015) http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25903751</p>
<p>Conclusions: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.</p>

<p>"Cloth masks [...] may actually increase your risk of infection". "Not clear they work” Harvard Study published May 21, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine</p>
<p>From the New England Journal of Medicine</p>
<p>"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic." https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app</p>
<p>CDC study on the use of personal protective face masks against viral influenza transmission found no significant protection against or reduction of viral transmission of influenza among infected and uninfected individuals.</p>
<p>We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility</p>

        <p>a good deal of those were from earlier in the pandemic, where scientists were still ascertaining the usage of such masks.  The general consensus among people with a fucking brain is that masks are useful and help reduce the spread of infection.</p>

        <p>For this specific virus, yes.  And masks and facial coverings have been used to combat illness throughout history.  The Spanish flue, for example, and the Great Plague of the 18th century.  Fucking plague doctors had a mask.  So, when I say masks are useful you braindead FUCK, you can take that shit to the bank.</p>

        <p>people who are healthy can still carry the virus and transmit it to immunocompromised people or people with chronic illnesses, such as asthma, which make fighting the virus much harder, once infected.  Its better to just wear a fucking mask so you don't transmit it to someone with those health issues, even if you, yourself are completely fine.</p>
