    <strong>Testing on Babies</strong>
    <p><p>I belonged to a subreddit that was geared toward mothers of children born during a certain month. It was fun to compare what our little ones were up to, what their habits were and how their schedules were organized. Then, after being there a year, I saw a post about a mom whose daughter was accepted into the vaccine trials. She was ECSTATIC, and she reassured everyone that if they had applied and hadn't heard anything, to just keep waiting. Maybe their children could be a part of the tests too!  </p>
<p>Now, I don't particularly like confrontation, but I wouldn't say I'm afraid of it. Not to the point that it will stop me from speaking when I feel it's necessary, anyway. So I chimed in briefly, since the post was only an hour old, that I hoped they were weighing up the risks as well as the benefits. And that was it. Literally two sentences. This, of course, was followed by some replies accusing me of being an antivaxxer and not following the rules. And then the OP replied with some long-winded message about how everything is fine, they're so happy to be a part of science, and we can agree to make different decisions so long as we don't judge each other - but that she was "confident in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine". </p>
<p>I couldn't stay quiet on that. I said that she literally could not know that because the POINT of the TRIAL is to find that out! That submitting children to testing when they're healthy is absolutely wrong. That the CDC has even said it's not safe for younger age groups, and it gets less safe the younger you are. And to someone else, I said that if you're an adult, I support your choice to be vaccinated or not, but it's wrong to submit a child to trials when they can't consent. I was told we're all animals anyway.</p>
<p>Then the mods contacted me to tell me I was out of line, I was an anti-vaxxer, I was harassing people and my comments were removed. I told the mods they were abusing their user base by withholding valuable information that they, as adults, should be able to decide on for themselves. And that their conflict resolution skills were greatly lacking. And that they sounded eerily like an episode of Stranger Things, but the bad guys conducting experimentation on children. Oh, and that they're a platform and should be allowing conversation from both sides.  </p>
<p>I really hope this post was not a real person. But I'm afraid it probably was, and that poor, sweet 1 year old. I hope things don't go down for them like they did for the video we're seeing circulating now.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, they are. This one seemed to do okay since it was private, but the birthday posts all started with "everyone invited to the party was vaccinated" etc. Annoying that anyone felt they had to write that, or wanted to, and worse that EVERYONE did.</p>

        <p>You sound real bitter for being kicked out of a parent group. But here you are being bitter and trying to act like you were a victim and demonized for your opinions. </p>
<p>I’m part of that “toxic bump group” and i saw your comments and I’m very happy you got a warning and your comments were removed. I’ll likely be downvoted but you weren’t as passive as you come off here. You were judgmental, you spread your “facts” and continued to bully a parent who is doing more than your selfish self will ever do. While you likely refuse to believe in science, a parent is furthering science with reliable resources. I hope you haven’t lost a loved one to covid. Or seen your own father fight for their life on an oxygen tank while he was being evaluated “worthy” enough to continue on oxygen when there was a lack of resources for others. And I hope your child never needs to use the resources and volunteerism of other children and parents to keep your child alive because of Covid since I could safely assume you aren’t vaccinated nor are you practicing safety protocols to prevent you or your may baby from being sick. </p>
<p>You make me sick. And I hope for the best for your kid since she has to be raised by you.</p>

        <p>OP most definitely was the victim in this situation if you want to call it that. </p>
<p>She was just trying to be positive in the sense that she hopes the parent weighed all the pros and cons of submitter her child as a test subject for a virus that has a 99.7% survival rate. And for children is even higher. </p>
<p>I don’t know if you have looked into the VAERS database on the CDC website that is maintained by the CDC and FDA jointly. There have been 3,922 deaths reported to the database due to the vaccine. And those are the only ones that are being reported. The percentage for the number of all adverse reactions from the 4 different vaccines out for experiment at the moment, including death, being reported is 1%. Also young adolescents have died of heart inflammation shortly after receiving the vaccine. Completely healthy 13-17 year olds! Dead. </p>
<p>Just because you are not in support of an experimental injection being pushed on the population before clinical trials are over and short term and long term effects are know  does NOT mean you do not believe in science. </p>
<p>Also, i don’t think this is a sub you’d normally frequent so, I’m not sure why you’re trolling the OP.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, maybe OP wanted to share some of the historically known adverse side effects from attempts at mRNA vaccination that were SUPPOSED to be addressed before experimenting on large portions of the population.</p>
<p>In “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology</a>,” a study less than two years old at the time of the outbreak, it shares this info about mRNA trials:</p>
<p>• ex vivo mRNA cancer treatment (where a patient’s cells are treated and then re-infused in the body) is much more effective in targeting but also more expensive than in vitro mRNA prophylactic treatments (the current vaccines): - “Ex vivo DC [dendritic cell] loading allows precise control of the cellular target, transfection efficiency and other cellular conditions, but as a form of cell therapy, it is an expensive and labour-intensive approach to vaccination. Direct injection of mRNA is comparatively rapid and cost-effective, but it does not yet allow precise and efficient cell-type-specific delivery.”</p>
<p>• mRNA inhibition of antigen can also have a negative immune response: “innate immune sensing of mRNA has also been associated with the inhibition of antigen expression and may negatively affect the immune response”</p>
<p>Another study notes that until only recent developments in the last few years, “The majority of investigations focused on DNA-based vaccines because of concerns about mRNA instability and the inefficient in vivo delivery” (“<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5987916/">Nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines</a>…”).</p>
<p>Back to the original paper, it provides additional information about recent clinical reports that were less promising:</p>
<p>• “While preclinical studies have generated great optimism about the prospects and advantages of mRNA-based vaccines, two recent clinical reports have led to more tempered expectations 22,91. In both trials, immunogenicity was more modest in humans than was expected based on animal models, a phenomenon also observed with DNA-based vaccines171, and the side effects were not trivial.”</p>
<p>• “Recent human trials have demonstrated moderate and in rare cases severe injection site or systemic reactions for different mRNA platforms22,91. Potential safety concerns that are likely to be evaluated in future preclinical and clinical studies include local and systemic inflammation, the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components."</p>
<p>• “A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms54,166 induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity167,168. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.”</p>
<p>• “Another potential safety issue could derive from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination. Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to oedema” 169. [oedema is “excessive accumulation of fluid, mainly water, in the tissue spaces of the body”]</p>
<p>• “Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation [blood clots]170. Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations.”</p>
<p>To repeat: "Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations." I don't see any real evaluation of safety happening, only the claim repeated ad infinitum that they're "safe."</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we look at the recent Israel Pfizer study, we see the actual numbers in addition to percentages, and then we see that the vaccines aren't making much of a difference in preventing hospitalization and death, which is the reason we're being sold to take the vaccine, since it doesn't necessarily prevent you from getting sick (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext)</p>
<p>"Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were:</p>
<p>• 97·2% against COVID-19-related hospitalisation (4·6 vs ,0·3 per 100000 person-days),</p>
<p>• 97·5% against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation (2·7 vs 0·2 per 100000 person-days), and</p>
<p>• 96·7% against COVID-19 related death (0·6 vs 0·1 per 100000 person-days)"</p>
<p>The 96.7% against death is a relatively small number in both groups, with 0.6 deaths per unvaccinated versus 0.1 deaths in vaccinated in every 100000 people. The hospitalization range of 4.6 to 0.3 is also low in both, which means the fatality and hospitalization rates are low in both groups, and shows we're definitely making progress toward herd immunity in BOTH vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.</p>
<p>So, why exactly do we want to test a vaccine platform with a history of adverse side effects, poor efficacy, and significant safety concerns on infants and children?</p>

        <p>Wow, doesn't sound like I'm the bitter one here... You should not be happy my comments were removed because A) I didn't harass anyone, it was kind disagreement and B) your rights are being stepped on if my rights are being stepped on. My comments should not have been removed for being unpopular - that's a dangerous line that's being crossed.</p>
<p>Actually, I haven't known anyone who's died of Covid. So you're right on that one. I did not, however, get to attend my grandpa's funeral because some crazy conspiracy theorists, who conflated the infection rate with the death rate, closed the country down. Smh</p>
<p>And no, the vaccines aren't done with testing yet. That won't happen until 2023, as a matter of fact. Since you science so well, I would think you'd be aware of that. But until the tests are done, I'm not going to consider taking the experimental jab, and neither are any of my children. </p>
<p>I also didn't say anything particularly mean to that mom who was volunteering her healthy baby for experimentation. But, I wasn't going to pussy foot around the fact that what she was doing was unethical. If that hurts people's feelings, well, I think it should. You should feel bad if you're doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Also, thank you. I have 4 of them and a lot more experience than you. One day you'll go to the doctor and disagree, and you'll realize that the system isn't what you thought it was. But until then, I wish you the best.</p>

        <p>You left part of the group on your own after being disagreed with, and then got kicked out of the sub. This was after you said you always had trouble staying in mom groups with your previous kids. At some point you have to realize that the problem is, indeed, you. You're not kind. You're condescending, arrogant, racist, homophobic, and ignorant, and you will argue your point until nobody can stand to be around you. This was just another example of you putting your nose where it doesn't belong and being condescending to someone who doesn't need or want your uneducated opinion.</p>

        <p>Having a different opinion isn't a crime. I left other groups because they died, not because I had issues. But I'm sure you know everything about me. Like that I have a 4 year degree from a private university and am addicted to researching everything that catches my interest. You have no idea if I'm uneducated or not, or where I get my news or where I live or who I'm friends with. You sound like you're being overly judgmental for someone who's calling me ignorant, yet you know nothing about me.</p>
<p>Please go spend time with people exactly like yourself. Obviously you can't handle a nice Christian mom with 4 kids with a different opinion than you.</p>
