        <p>Yep. Been back in the office full time. Didn’t take long for the same old BS to start. Now it’s just with a mask on. Bosses are MIA as usual and workers being harassed. Some things never change.</p>

        <p>My company has been pretty great. I’m moving out of state and will continue to work from home. They were really relieved I wanted to stay on.  I can do the exact same job from home. Not all days but a lot of days I get more done, and a lot of things that are time sensitive I can jump on after the kids go to sleep. It’s both harder and easier to have a work/life balance but I’ll take it over the commute any day.</p>

        <p>If whatever the boss wants you to do can be done as effectively from home, then a requirement to do it from the office instead is merely micromanaging, which is generally a very bad idea regardless of occupation.</p>
<p>Many people are quitting when they get micromanaged.</p>

        <p>Wanting to work from home, if you have that kind of job, doesn't mean you're lazy. In fact, I think it's kind of dumb for companies to waste so much energy and money on running big offices full of desk drones that could do their job from anywhere.</p>

        <p>If I may offer a different perspective:</p>
<p>I was one of the poor saps that got left in office when everyone else went home. Trying to navigate that year when the world was suddenly not set up for in person workers, let alone in person parents was absolutely hell. </p>
<p>From my perspective: those that had to stay in office ended up having to take on additional tasks that those who went home would have previously done. When something had to get done it was impossible to get a response in a timely manner (things that you could just “swing by” to get). Since informal chat was now the way of the dodo bird you ended up with whole days filled with meetings that would have previously been resolved quickly. Some people absolutely could do their job at home, and do it well, but many people seemed to poof into thin air. The culture and trust in other associates went very downhill, and due to the increased difficulty and workload of those still in office resentment definitely grew. It was like there were two different worlds.  Those that were home definitely advocated, loudly, for lockdowns to continue. Meanwhile those of us in office struggled with distance learning and getting groceries with the reduced hours at the beginning. </p>
<p>The parenting thing while both of us were in office and kids had a chaotic schedule became untenable. I ended up seeking out a permanent work at home position (one that is actually long term work at home and set up to be long term work at home) and taking a pay cut and reduced role to do it. Night and day difference from a burden and stress standpoint. I can see why people do not want to go back, but I can also see why a hybrid schedule, at minimum is necessary even for those that “can do the whole job at home.”</p>
<p>Now all of this is anecdotal but my partner and I saw similar things and some of our friends in other industries also saw this . Some of it was cutting people slack in the beginning but ended up putting the job on others shoulders.  I would say, if you can do ALL of your duties, with the same effectiveness at home as you did in office pre-Covid, great, you should stay home. But if you job duties changed or were reduced or expectations changed once you were home, return to office or renegotiation of role makes sense.</p>
