    <strong>Two positive things today</strong>
    <p><p>1 - I took one of my teens to his doctor today and not a single question was asked about 'the vaccine'.  No mention of it at all.</p>
<p>2 - We ran into our dollar store briefly, and despite the sign saying masks were required, no customers were wearing them.  The cashiers just rolled their eyes and laughed when sympathy was expressed about them having to wear them.  </p>
<p>Maybe there is hope...</p></p>

        <p>Where are you?</p>
<p>Interestingly you will probably find media, government and peer pressure far more likely to recommend a vaccine to you. In this new world medical staff aren’t really listened to anymore. </p>

        <p>We live in far, far upstate NY.  It's a mostly red area, although there are some tourist trap towns about 50 miles away that are blue.  </p>
<p>Lots, and I mean lots, of 2nd Amendment supporters.  Also a lot of LEOs, and 'Back the Blue' signs are all over with virtually 100% support from the communities.</p>

        <p>Same where I currently am. (North Carolina visiting an ex boyfriend)</p>
<p>Masks are 'recommended' but not one store I have been in gives a flying damn. My ex says it's been like this for months and doesn't think most North Carolinians will ever go back to mask wearing as they're over this government control of everything we do.</p>
