    <strong>Finally admitting their "So effective vaccine" maybe it is so much: More than 1,000 Israelis test positive for COVID</strong>
    <p><p>They started admitting that their so "effective vaccine" it is not so much. Highlights from the article:</p>
<p>" <strong>The effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Delta variant is  “weaker” than health officials had hoped, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett  said on Friday, as over 1,000 people tested positive for coronavirus ..</strong>"</p>
<p>" <strong>At the moment, around 60% of the patients in serious conditions have  been vaccinated. Moreover, according to Hebrew University researchers  who advise the government, around 90% of newly infected people over the  age of 50 are fully</strong>  <a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-science/covid-vaccines-for-kids-under-12-could-come-in-early-winter-fda-674078"><strong>vaccinated</strong></a><strong>."</strong></p>
<p>And they are still pushing people into vaccination. What is the point?</p></p>
