    <strong>ComFluCOV study</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.nbt.nhs.uk/research-innovation/our-research/covid-19-vaccine-studies/covid-19-com-cov-study</p>
<p>That link tells you a bit about it. Its for participants aged 18 and over, and I think the study is based on just under 800 people. 
They were talking about the trials study on the 7th May 2021,  and the way they spoke in that article (different to the one posted) it did not sound like they had started the trials at that time. Though they might have done. </p>
<p>The study is to see about the safety of combining the two doses, basically. But from all that i have read about it, it doesn't seem to pull in people from different backgrounds. </p>
<p>The fact that in order to fit the criteria for this trial, you need to only have had your first covid dose pretty much rules out all of those over 65, which is the recommended age for the flu jab. So there will be very few, if anybody left in that age range to take part in the trial. 
It also rules out children, which are their next target for both flu and covid jabs. </p>
<p>So all of those who really would be at major risk, the elderly, young children, immunocompromised, are more than likely not participating in the trials. So the trials will glide through as if they are successful, and then it will roll out across the board. </p>
<p>I also don't see much of this being spoken about anywhere, which leads me to be even more concerned about it.</p>
<p>Second article I mentioned: https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/news/study-looking-whether-covid-19-and-flu-vaccines-can-be-administered-same-time</p>
<p>You also have to be under 65 to take part: https://twitter.com/UCLHresearch/status/1392464424024293376?s=20</p></p>
