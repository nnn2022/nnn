    <strong>Just how bad is virtual school?</strong>
    <p><p>So I'm curious, does anybody have any stories about how bad virtual schooling really is?   I'd like to hear them if you have them.</p>
<p>Are kids really just sitting at home playing Fortnite all day not bothering to log in?  Are teachers just putting YouTube videos up in front of their students and walking away for the day? </p>
<p>Or...are there rare instances where it's actually working, I'd like to hear about that too, if you have them.</p></p>

        <p>My niece is back doing online because of covid restrictions not because of the virus itself. Many teachers wanted to keep the schools open but couldn’t because of the governors stupid restrictions. To answer your question it’s bad especially for the younger students, my niece is in 1st grade and can barely understand the work even with the teacher/class on a zoom call. I have to help her with practically all of it, it’s a sad sad attempt of “school”. I imagine some kids aren’t even doing it and more power to them.</p>

        <p>I was talking with a friend about this. They're in a class with 23 registered people. Attendance is voluntary, so only 5 show up to class regularly. Everyone else googles the answers and the teacher expects people to learn by posting YouTube videos. This is not working</p>

        <p>I have a child with ADD that the school has been coddling over it since first grade. I didn't even realize it was a problem. I just thought he was being a kid. But they harped on it for so long that I let them evaluate him for special classes and eventually diagnose him. The school has bent over backwards to accommodate his "disability". It's weird, but whatever gets him to the next grade I guess. These aren't the kids that should be doing virtual classes, yet here we are. I didn't have to experience any of it since me, my ex, and his new wife are all "essential workers" and have to pay a "daycare" to cover what the school now doesn't, but last week they closed down both the school and his "daycare", so now I sit with him during virtual classes in the am until his Dad picks him up and uh there is no way he's actually learning anything. The teacher, bless her heart for real, runs a Zoom class, but literally runs through it. There's no time for questions or working out math problems. It's truly awful. The homework is laughable. I understand the teachers are doing their absolute best, but my son hasn't had a decent education since February.</p>

<p>I thought that kids with special needs got to go to school, but maybe that's only in some areas, or maybe your son doesn't qualify or something?</p>

        <p>I’m going on a hunch here but I would assume there is no personal attention given to any students. The lack of this in turn would make students uninterested, therefore increasing the loss of learning. Over a long span of time this seems dangerous.</p>

        <p>My 13 year old is depressed and rarely comes out of her room, no matter how hard I try. Every time I go in during her classes the teachers and students are staring at each other over zoom in silence. For my 6 year old, it’s even worse. She logs in for 5 hours every day and the first 2 hours are spent with her 70 year old teacher (no offense about age, but her teacher has zero understanding of technology) trying to figure out why her mic isn’t working, why she can’t see or hear students, why she can’t change her camera view, etc. then she’ll take a phone call while we can hear her (it seems like she doesn’t know we can still hear her) for 10 minutes. After which, I’ll finally get frustrated and call the school office. They’ll go down there to check on ‘Mrs. I don’t care’ at which time school will start with an hour left. Then the kids try to speak and the teacher tells my daughter there’s no time to speak now... and mutes her mic. About this time my 6 year old beautiful daughter tells me she is stressed, starts crying, and runs to her bedroom and shuts the door. I’ve sent multiple emails to everyone in the district with no response...
Yeah... remote learning is going great. 👍</p>

        <p>First person perspective as a high school student here. Btw feel free to ask me any questions about it.</p>
<p>We don’t learn anything. Some teachers have pre recorded videos that I really like, bc then you can pause it to take notes or re hear something. Others just do a 2 hr google meet which are the worst. My computer isn’t meant to handle that long of a meet and neither am I. I am usually a good student but my attention span drops after about an 1- 1 and 1/2 of learning. There’s a lot of youtube. Some teachers barely respond. I had a question for my counselor about a course and waited a week for an email. For me I definitely get over assigned work plus we switched to a system where we only have 2 classes at once rather than 4 to promote social distancing (when we were in person) This is terrible. It’s so much work for both teachers and students. It’s hard to absorb so much information in such a fast amount of time, especially online. I don’t know how it would work for anyone unless you were either a genius who knew everything, or if you had really bad social anxiety or autism or something like that. Most kids are exhausted and depressed.</p>
