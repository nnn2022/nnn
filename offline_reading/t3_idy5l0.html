    <strong>Please explain the aversion to masks</strong>
    <p><p>I'm hoping for an honest dialogue and mean absolutely no disrespect, trolling, or whatever.  Why are some folks so strongly against wearing masks in public?  I've asked neighbors and coworkers their feelings and got a few answers, but I'd like to hear from a more diverse audience.  What is it, exactly?  You don't like being told what to do?  You don't think they work to stop the spread of covid?  You don't think the virus is as bad as the media/government/whoever says it is?</p></p>

<li>They reduce our ability to interact as a social species - this causes depression, anxiety and even violence</li>
<li>They are bad for your health - dentists are already reporting a huge spike in tooth decay and gum disease, doctors are seeing a big jump in cases of fungal mouth infections, guess what changed this year to result in this?</li>
<li>They are there to cater to other people's fear - your fear is not my problem, in the same way that when I am stood on my bed yowling about spiders, my fear is not your problem</li>

        <p>As someone who fundamentally disagrees, but is open to broadening my view, do you have sources for your first and third points?  </p>
<p>I would also argue that your fourth point is misleading.  Someone else's fear is your problem when you could be contagious but unaware due to being asymptomatic or presymptomatic.  This bleeds into your fifth point as well, because the government has a constitutionally appointed responsibility to "guard and protect" the health and safety of its people.  <a href="https://www.acslaw.org/expertforum/face-covering-requirements-and-the-constitution/">Here</a> is a summary of litigation that essentially upholds the governments power to enforce a mask mandate.  The analogy to No-smoking bans seems particularly apt, and more applicable than your arachnophobia analogy.</p>
<p>However, if masks are fundamentally ineffective, and possibly dangerous, as you claim, this is a moot point.  So, I will defer again to your sources on points 1 and 3.</p>

        <p>No, someone else’s fear that I could be asymptomatically carrying a virus is not my problem. I don’t know what prompts you to say that it is. Your health is not my responsibility and your fear of the noses and mouths of total strangers passing you on the sidewalk is your issue for you to cope with.</p>

        <p>No, because being seen by others wearing a mask feeds a culture of hysterical fear that is actively harming people. Setting an example of sanity and helping to pull the culture away from the cliff is what is truly kind and loving. You might not believe it, but I do.</p>

        <p>Is doing something that is ineffective, being kind? Don't get me wrong, it's not that masks don't do anything, ever. It is that there is evidence that they are not effective in reduce the spread of disease in the general population.

        <p>Thanks for quoting a source!  I Googled one at random (2nd from the bottom) and found it was used in a study on COVID-19.  Here's a link:  </p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748920301139  </p>
<p>Please note the following under "results":  </p>
<p>In general, the results show protection for healthcare workers and community members, and likely benefit of masks used as source control. We found eight clinical trials (Aiello et al., 2012; Simmerman et al., 2011; Larson et al., 2010; Aiello et al., 2010; MacIntyre et al., 2009; Cowling et al., 2008, Suess et al., 2012; Cowling et al., 2009) on the use of masks in the community (Table 1). In the community, <strong>masks appear to be effective with and without hand hygiene, and both together are more protective</strong> (Aiello et al., 2012; Aiello et al., 2010; MacIntyre et al., 2009). However, some randomised controlled trials which measured both hand hygiene and masks measured the effect of hand hygiene alone, but not of masks alone (Simmerman et al., 2011, Cowling et al., 2009). In more than one trial, interventions had to be used within 36 hours of exposure to be effective (Cowling et al., 2009; Suess et al., 2012).</p>

        <p>That study was not on a list, but still appears valid. What makes it interesting is that it's a meta-study. In fact, it references some of the studies that the WHO published and came to a different conclusion. Taking a look at the 2nd in the table ( because it's on the WHO list and in the study you linked to) I posted came to interesting conclusions: 1) Mask use by itself did not make a difference, and 2) Mask use combined with hand sanitizing  was better than hand-sanitizing alone... an seemingly contradictory distinction which makes it possible to be used to say that masks do and do not work to prevent transmission.</p>
<p>The joys of studies is that it's often easy to find studies that contradict others. The key is to understand why.</p>

        <p>It's a bit confusing to me.  Part of the problem (imo) is the word "mask" is too vague and the studies being done aren't really for the public.  When researching this topic I found several studies on efficacy of surgical or N95 masks in a hospital setting, which doesn't translate to a <em>community setting</em> with a simple face covering.</p>

        <p>It quickly becomes a full-time job studying the subtle nuances of each study to understand why there's a difference. We're not going to solve the debate. My point in posting that list was simple that there are reasons to believe they don't work, and IF that's true, is there a point to wearing them even though people feel safer?</p>
<p>Another way to look at this would be to compare places with prolonged mask use like CA to other states without mask mandates like MO and ME and we find that CA has more cases and deaths per million than either of the non-mask states. There are other states like LA with no mask mandate, but with more cases and deaths per million than CA. This feels like the studies, and we're left with an effectiveness rating of: maybe.</p>
<p>What exacerbates the problem is the ever expanding list of mandatory measures, many of which have equally clear efficacy: stay-at-home, closing non-essential businesses, social distancing, increased surface-cleaning, group-size limitations, and masks. There seems to be no limit to the number and length of implementation of measures that help us be kind to those afraid of the virus while severely limiting the ability of people to live their lives. Perhaps if masks were the only limitation, we would see less of a push back, but for many people it (or one of the other mandates) is the straw that broke the camel's back.</p>

        <p>I'll take the bait, I guess.</p>
<p>I don't think they work to stop the spread of COVID. Many places that have been mandating masks for months already are allegedly still "deeply inundated with cases", such as New Jersey (Murphy changes his mind on whether NJ is winning or not on a daily basis). My state of PA is allegedly seeing more cases, and we've also had mandated masks in retail since around April, and "in public at all times" since July 1st with no meaningful decline, according to official documents. Our indoor dining even got restricted a few weeks ago, and we already had the mask mandate in place. I've been in PA and NJ, and I see near 100% compliance (I don't care what supposed PA and NJ residents here claim, I have rarely seen anyone without a mask, even outdoors since July). </p>
<p>I'm sure you'll say, "But doctors wear them!! Surely they work!!" Doctors wear them, sure. With caveats, of course. Doctors tend to clean or dispose masks and gloves very often. The average citizen does not. Only surgeons wear them for several hours on end, and even then, they operate in a temperature controlled, sterilized environment. Doctors also have specialized training on the cleaning and disposal of masks. Average Joes do not, they fuss with their masks, don't clean them frequently if ever, etc. Thus the masks are not as effective as they could be at preventing spread.</p>

        <p>i find myself touching my face constantly when i have a mask on, which is something i didn't do as often before. maybe i just think about it more, but i know i am constantly touching my face to adjust the mask, scratch an itch, brush off my eyelashes, breathe. </p>
<p>it's literally something sitting on your face - how can we expect people to not futz with it? i think that's a really strange behavioral thing. we're supposed to keep stuff off our faces, out of our noses and eyes - a mask is unnatural and it feels like a devolution in human physiology and social norms. the skin is your largest organ and strongest barrier against disease - why are we doing this to ourselves?</p>
<p>okay i'll go back to thinking about touching my face now, carry on, god bless.</p>

<p>There's a more limited quantity of masks. Most people have one or maybe two, or they have a pack of those disposable ones. Those surgical masks tend to sell out quick even now when they're being produced more. That, and I don't know about you, but I don't do the laundry every single day, if you wear a mask every day, that would require people to wash/clean them every day, whether by hand or in a washer. Many people won't or don't. I know some do, and some people are psychotic about cleaning their masks (one guy at /r/coronavirus claimed he would put just the mask into the washing machine three times a day), but still...</p>

        <p>&rt; So the problem then is the behavior, not the mask?  Shouldn't it be like an item of clothing?  Wear it once or twice and then into the laundry it goes.</p>
<p>The problem is unsolvable behavior. People naturally touch their faces all the damn time. Proper mask hygiene requires practiced skill and vigilance: NEVER touching your face, always washing your hands before and after touching the mask, frequently changing your mask.</p>
<p>Your comment alone reveals the problem: you think wearing a mask “once or twice” is okay. It’s not. Proper mask hygiene requires single-use (whether you sanitize or dispose of it) and very frequent changing of the mask.</p>
<p>If you touch your face without first washing your hands, discarding your mask, touching your face as needed, washing your hands, putting on a CLEAN new mask, and washing your hands again ... you’re doing it wrong. People touch their faces ALL the damn time.</p>
<p>If you are not changing your mask very, very frequently throughout the day (using proper handwashing procedures each time) and ANYTIME it gets damp from sweat or humidity, you are doing it wrong.</p>
<p>If you briefly pull your mask down under your nose/away from your face, or otherwise touch it without replacing it, you’re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>It takes serious effort to learn to wear masks properly for more than a few minutes at a time. It requires training people out of natural, lifelong behaviors they engage in many times a day.</p>
<p>This is not a behavior problem. This is an impossibility problem.</p>

        <p>My aversion to masks is I already had COVID and I don’t like participating in security theater for the sake of virtue signaling when I cannot contract or spread the disease. It’s that simple.  </p>

        <p>They’re uncomfortable and inconvenient. Needing to put a mask on just to go in my backyard is annoying as fuck especially for my young kids.</p>
<p>All the mask stans are basically ignoring the fact that you shouldn’t be putting it back on your face after taking it off. (It should be washed)</p>
<p>Wearing them outdoors is pure virtue signalling with no scientific justification based on limited transmission outdoors. Wearing them for a second while you walk to your table in a restaurant also is not related tothe science of virus transmission.</p>
<p>A temporary targeted mandate for public indoor spaces is a reasonable debate. Ad infinitum for every time you leave your home is annoying as fuck and not  just a mild inconvenience.</p>

        <p>You need to be trained in the correct use and disposal of masks. There are specific guidelines to minimise contamination from touching masks for putting on and taking off. You fuck up once and it's game over. Masks need to be fitted to your face. You need to be clean shaven to wear a mask. Masks filter 95% of visible particles, 0% of viruses. You need to wear multiple layers including shield to even begin to reduce your chance of infection. As soon as a mask is wet it needs to be changed. All air inhaled and exhaled needs to go through the filter medium.</p>
<p>Do you think the general public is capable of doing this? Why do you think so many medical workers are infected, because it's so hard!</p>
<p>All evidence suggest this is just another flu virus. It is not as bad as the 2009 pandemic and we didn't even care back then.</p>

        <p>Masks are to protect the wearer - not the other way around.</p>
<p>the "face covering" mandate is silly/ as in there are specification for masks for each use. but the original mandate for covid was- face covering , bandanna , cotton, any old thing.  if this in fact was the world wide killer as advertised , the only adequate face covering would be a fresh air respirator,</p>
<p>no it's not as bad as advertised and since it isn't. they hype all the bad news they can and never any good news.   our local news has started to ask why someone shot in the head was a covid death. so the data is a misleading mess</p>
<p>even the CDC data supports that it's no worse than the seasonal flu , and with every flu they put out instructions for certain people to take precautions.  not shut down everything.</p>

<p>Could you please provide a source for this?  I saw something yesterday about bandannas and gator-style masks being actually <em>worse</em> than no mask, but proper masking does stop spread of viral particulate.  I'd just like to see a competing study that shows, as you say, they are useless.</p>

        <p>I should clarify. We often get bogged down in discussions of whether masks work or not, but for me the question is, are they even necessary at all?   I don't think so.</p>
<p>Humankind has survived thousands of years without needing to be forced to wear a mask.   We already have an "internal mask" called the immune system.  It fights off untold millions of germs a day while you live your life, without which you would die of the common cold or from getting a cut on your arm.  </p>
<p>Masks do serve a specific purpose mostly in medical/hospital situations i.e. a surgeon wears one to avoid spitting into a patient's open chest cavity or a nurse wears one in the room of certain hospital patients who are immuno-compromised.  Also they can protect you from dust or heavy pollution.</p>
<p>Masks were never meant for universal virus defense.   And nothing about this covid19 shows its any different than any other virus other than picking on mostly elderly people.  I mean they've had to resort to hyper monitoring the cases now since hospitalizations and death rate have flatlined and declined.  </p>
<p>I come from the position of if your scared and it makes you comfortable, go ahead and wear one, but don't force otherwise healthy people to wear one, its pure governmental over reach.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The debate has moved to whether the decisions we are making (lockdowns, masks, social distancing, etc) are right or wrong, but all these make the assumption that we need to do something drastic to begin with. At this point the data is very clear. This disease is not deadly for the vast majority of people. It really is only particularly deadly for older people, especially older people with underlying health conditions. But old, sick people are vulnerable to most diseases. Always have been. Always will be. And even then, it's not like covid is a guaranteed death sentence for old people. Most people will recover from it. Even serious cases. We have worked ourselves into a frenzy over something that simply doesn't merit the level of hysteria we have given it. Do masks work? What does that even mean? There is enough contradictory evidence out there that proclaiming the science to be settled on the matter seems to be a tad bit premature. There are health organizations through out the world, scientists, epidemiologists, etc. on both sides of the argument. So you can't really say there is an overwhelming consensus. But in my opinion it doesn't matter if masks "work" or not. This disease is not deadly enough to require invasive policies like mandatory masks. And it's almost impossible to actually measure the effectiveness of masks, since there is no control, no tracking, no agreement on terms, no enforcement, no standards, no universal policy, etc. For every place that looks like masks made a difference, there is another place where masks had no effect. There are even places where the introduction of mask mandates led to worse outcomes. And whether a mask works depends on how you define "works". If my end goal is to quickly achieve herd immunity by allowing the virus to spread naturally through communities ensuring as many people as possible have antibodies, then the whole idea of masks gets in the way of my goals,and therefore do not "work". They are counterproductive.</p>

        <p>Last week my wife's sister got married. We live in Utah, where things are fairly open, and have been for the most part since mid April. Her other sister lives in Seatlle, where they've been pretty much locked down this entire time. She came down to Utah for the wedding with her 18 month old. Within a day or two the baby got super sick. Two ear infections, croup, the kid was miserable. He wasn't the only kid there, but all the other kids had been having a normal summer playing with friends, socializing, getting dirty, you know, being a kid, and he was the only one to get sick. I'm pretty certain that the last 5 months of quarantine has extremely weakened his immune system by him not interacting with the world the way humans are supposed to. So the first foreign viruses he encountered upon leaving quarantine immediately rocked his world. Our attempts to play God will eventually bite us in the ass.</p>

        <p>I'm not averse to masks in certain circumstances. I'm a biotech student and I usually have to wear protective gear when I work in labs (especially microbiology labs) such as safety goggles, a lab coat, nitrile gloves and a surgical mask. I'm totally fine wearing a mask there and where there are vulnerable people (such as in hospitals, care homes, if I visit someone vulnerable, etc). I'm okay wearing masks indoors for the time being, but I don't want the measures to stay indefinitely because ''it could save ONE life''. </p>
<p>However, I am opposed to children as young as TWO years old being forced to wear a mask and I'm opposed to people needing to wear masks EVERYWHERE (in some places they are mandatory OUTSIDE).</p>
<p>Why:</p>
<ol>
<li>The average person does not wear their mask correctly (i.e. they don't wash them everyday, they put them back in their pockets, they don't change their masks after 4 hours of use if it's disposable, they don't disinfect their hands before putting it on, etc).</li>
<li>Viral particles are not filtered by most masks - only droplets are. I'm not talking about N95 here but your average two ply cotton mask. I guess ''it's better than nothing'', but when it comes with so many downsides it's not really worth it in my opinion.</li>
<li>Most places have weird rules concerning masks, such as restaurants where you need to wear them at the entrance but not at the table. People then put them on top of the table and it gets contaminated. Then they put it back on and don't wash them or their hands in the process. The more you touch your mask, the more infected it gets. You're not supposed to put it on and remove it non-stop because it's simply <strong>NOT meant to be worn outside of clinical/laboratory settings.</strong></li>
<li>It impedes communication because it muffles speech (many people need to remove it to speak or at least fiddle with it) and also because it hides facial expressions (a form of nonverbal communication).</li>
<li>It's not a viable option for children and it could have serious impacts on their development. <a href="https://theconversation.com/face-time-heres-how-infants-learn-from-facial-expressions-53327">Babies need to see facial expressions in order to grow into healthy individuals</a>. Also I have worked with children in summer camps and they are NOT able to wear masks like everyone preaches they are. It's so laughable but kids... well they act like kids and they can't stop touching their faces and putting their fingers in their mouths and noses even if you constantly remind them not to. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/lbpsb-miscommunication-on-mandatory-mask-policy-1.5690148">That is why in Quebec (where I'm from) they have said that they cannot enforce mandatory mask in classes.</a></li>
<li>If you want to truly protect yourself, it can cost a LOT. Here a quality cotton mask can cost up to 17$, a pack of 10 disposable masks (which you're only supposed to wear once) can cost up to 15$. In total you could end up spending around 300$ on masks per year if you alternate between cotton masks and disposable ones like me. Not everyone can afford that so they will simply buy one and re-use it forever, which let's be honest here, is kind of gross. If the government wants us to wear masks, then GIVE THEM AWAY FOR FREE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE for starters.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/08/more-masks-than-jellyfish-coronavirus-waste-ends-up-in-ocean">Disposable masks create so much WASTE.</a> Suddenly no one gives a fuck about the environment.</li>

        <p>For me it’s that I have medical conditions and can’t wear one. I’m sick of being forced to do something I physically cannot just to live my life again and find it ridiculous. </p>
<p>There is no evidence to show masks help, and in fact all the evidence stacks up in the contrary. They don’t protect against virus transmission, the virus goes straight through. Masks give people a false sense of security and encourage them to let their guard down with other things (hygiene, distancing-which I don’t think is a huge issue but shows masks defeat the purpose they want them to have). Every study that has come out in favor of masks has shoddy methods and it’s clear they just wanted to get the result they wanted, which pisses me off. </p>
<p>I’m just not about forcing people to do something like this. I frequently hear the “well you have to wear clothes” argument, but how is this similar at all? They are asking people to put something over their <em>airways</em>, and in many places they have to do it while working out now too. This isn’t a simple “you have to wear shoes” thing, this is a health concern and issue for many people.</p>

        <p>My doctor refused, saying he would lose his license if he did so. He has seen me through asthma and ptsd struggles and knows that this is something I can’t do, but won’t tell me so in fear of any liability or punishment from the higher powers or whatever. The nurses at his office all tried to get him to do so, one even said “if anyone qualifies for an exemption it’s you”, but he wouldn’t. And many places won’t even accept them, the airlines won’t now, I called gyms in the area and they said even with one they couldn’t let me in without a mask. I’ve tried at many businesses around town with similar results, it seems the ones that honor medical exemptions do so without notes (as they should) and the ones that won’t honor just your word on it won’t honor a doctor’s note either.</p>
<p>I’m at my wit’s end with this, it’s not just an annoyance but I have severe panic attacks when something is on my face or head so no face shields for me either. There is no end in sight and I have no idea how I can make it through, every day some new business or industry is coming out and saying no medical exemptions honored.</p>

<p>Thank you ❤️for now I’ll be trying to devise some plan of action and supporting businesses that don’t do this. I’m back at home for the week and finally found a gym (after calling about 50-none honored med exemptions) where nobody wears masks or is required to, it’s beautiful. They’re insanely busy too, he said enrollment there is up almost 150%, which is what I love to see. If we keep pumping money into businesses that are cool about all this, maybe we’ll spark some sort of change</p>

<p>Yes. This is why I find it hard to believe the people here who claim they just walk into places without masks (this includes in my home state and others with high mask compliance), with no issue as soon as they say they have a medical issue or just because. I've tried this, many times, the staff just insists that I shop online, and become an iron wall that will not allow entry. And no, people don't stop and clap and throw their masks down when people protest the masks either... (okay, that's me being a hyperbolic bitch, though that seems to be a prevailing and unrealistic attitude I see here).</p>

        <p>Yes. This. I am constantly told “just don’t comply” but that’s not how it works and isn’t a valid answer. Sure very few stores will budge and let you shop anyway based on corporate direction, but the vast majority will not and do have the authority to call the police for trespassing. They’ve kicked passengers off planes, kicked people out of gyms for not complying and have gotten police involved, there is no “oh just walk in and don’t wear one”. A gym here in CO kicked out a disabled vet with ptsd, no ears, and burn scars coverings his face because he couldn’t wear a mask, and it took him going to a lawyer and making a scene in the conservative news cycle here for them to even let him just exercise without one. </p>
<p>I respect the decision of a business to make their own decisions on this, I don’t think it should be mandated by the govt in any way and I do think businesses should be made to allow for medical exemptions instead of this “yup go ahead and deny anyone not wearing a mask for any reason” bs. I’m not one to make a scene and won’t and very few people would actually support this, but I do believe something needs to change and for me my big priority is getting medical exemptions honored as the first step. I’d love to do some sort of awareness project interviewing people with medical issues who can’t wear masks and how this is affecting them and all that. If it even humanizes us to a few of the mask Nazis and causes them to have some empathy, I’ll be pleased although it’s a long shot.</p>

        <p>I try to refrain from swearing but what you're going through is absolute bullshit.</p>
<p>I will keep repeating this so my words keep circulating.</p>
<p>There is not, nor should there ever be any reason for anyone to be able to both demand and receive private and personal information from you just because they think they can.  </p>
<p>Most places and people are not trained to keep this information confidential, nor do they have a vested interest in doing so.  </p>
<p>As such, they shouldn't even be allowed to <em>ask</em> you for it, let alone demand proof of it.  </p>
<p>And any attempts to make you give up personal information just "because" is absolute, unmitigated <em>bullshit</em>.  And the fact that reasonable accommodations are no longer being made is even more bullshit.</p>
<p>This is why it's intrusive to have to wear a mask, because it outs people who legitimately cannot wear them for things that they shouldn't have to feel shame over and treats them like freaks that need to be locked away "for their own good".  </p>
<p>Again, <em>bullshit.</em></p>

<p>That said, everything I said here is also important.  </p>
<p>The fidelity of confidentiality of personal information should not be breached for any reason.  I don't like the precedent that you don't have the right to privacy, especially to people that have no vested interest in maintaining it.</p>
<p>If a doctor's office releases your personal information?  Lawsuit.</p>
<p>If a lawyer's office does?  Disbarment.  </p>
<p>If the catty little priss behind the desk at your gym does?  They may get fired, but the genie's out of the bottle.  Your information is out there, and there's no justice once that happens.</p>
<p>And if you think people are going to be super duper professional without threats of fines or serious personal consequences, here's the example I use for how people without a vested interest in confidentiality behave:</p>

<p>Yes, the kid's name is stupid, but if someone's feeling spicy enough at you because they had a bad day or they feel like getting petty revenge, there will be no legal repercussions that will keep people from doing that again.</p>

        <p>Because masks are harmful, barbaric and unsanitary. Worse, the notion of <em>mandatory</em> masking violates our bodily autonomy and is therefore pure fascism. You'll notice that infamous war-criminals like Tony <a href="https://institute.global/tony-blair/importance-masks-exiting-lockdown">Blair</a> and Dick <a href="https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1276591702321647616">Cheney</a> are prominent mask-nazis.</p>
<p>Here are a few damning studies that show the harmful effects of masks:</p>

        <p>Definitely unsanitary.  I’m sure some may keep them Sanitized but I’m sure most don’t.   What do they do with the masks when they are not using them? (The reusable ones that is) unless the place you set the mask down on is  sanitized the mask won’t be safe.  </p>
<p>Also I’m sure most still touch the front and and their face too.  Natural human reaction.</p>

        <p>The outside of a used mask is absolutely filthy and teeming with bacteria and viruses. Now watch how often mask-wearers touch and adjust their germ-catchers. Then watch as they touch common surfaces and handle food, blissfully unaware their their hands are contaminated.</p>
<p>How can any civilized, modern person fail to see the disgusting, unhygienic nature of these masks?</p>

        <p>Thank you for the sources!  I'm gonna read these.  Appreciate it.  </p>
<p>edit: ok, lots to unpack here.<br>
- First study: pathogens were found on outer surfaces of masks of healthcare workers, with more being found the longer they were worn (seems obvious?).  Study found these workers 'may self contaminate'.<br>
- Second study: breathing difficulty from prolonged N95 mask usage among pregnant healthcare workers.  No hampering of blood flow to the fetus was found.<br>
- Third study: This 2004 study of 39 patients found significant "increased respiratory adverse effects" among those with end-stage renal disease.<br>
- Fourth study: "Exercise with facemask; Are we handling a devil's sword?" - A physiological hypothesis.  This appeared to be an abstract only.  I didn't see any results or conclusions.<br>
- Fifth study: Found labored breathing in a study of 44 surgical mask-wearing subjects after walking 6 minutes, with no effect on walking distance.  </p>
<p>I do appreciate the reply.  It seems there have been varied studies done over the years on mask usage, mostly among healthcare workers.</p>

        <p>I just hate how we're forced to wear them to quell others' fears. If you're afraid you'll catch the virus, don't go out, use delivery services, wear a mask, use hand sanitizer, wear gloves. That simple. Don't force it upon everyone else.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's easier than ever before to get things delivered to you, or to make it as contactless as possible. In addition, the world is as paranoid about being overly-sanitary as it's ever been, so thus, everywhere you'll go will likely be as clean as it's ever been. Even in tiny, tiny towns like mine, it's easier than ever to stay inside if you want to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The virus isn't that bad. The media is allll over this, and I don't blame them. I bet their ratings are sky high. They already can't be trusted at all, and they (and all the doomers) make the virus sound like it's cancer spreading everywhere. Like fuck off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which leads me to - I don't care if I happen to catch it. I'd rather live a normal life and catch the virus than not catch it and live the life all the doomers are living. Same goes for all my friends and family, who are all anti-mask. And if someone's really concerned they'll catch the virus and give it to an elderly relative, well it goes back to my two points above. Why is that elderly relative not quarantined? If they're that high-risk and that concerned about the virus, you probably shouldn't be seeing them often anyway. Plus, it's easier than ever to get delivery services, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonus - My counties and surrounding counties barely have any cases, as opposed to counties across the state which are noticeably worse (but still not that bad), yet mandates are forcing us all to do x, y, z. It's just bullshit. And what's great, is barely anyone wears them anyway, even store employees. All the citizens are tired of the mask shit. Especially since we barely have any cases within a huge radius of us. Again, if you're that scared of the virus, don't go out.</p>

<p>I do feel a one-size-fits-all approach to this pandemic is not ideal.  For example those in rural areas, where fewer people are encountered in a typical day-to-day setting than in densely packed cities, really should not be held to the same standard.  Common sense, really.</p>

        <p>We know that masks don't stop the spread of respiratory viruses, the science has determined that a while ago.  This respiratory virus is only harmful to the sick elderly and severely immune compromised.  You want to wear mask, be my guest but there isn't a rational reason to do so.  They figured this out after the 1918 Flu Pandemic, that unlike COVID-19 killed people in the prime of their lives.</p>

        <p>For me its the slippery slope, priming us for what could be next (mandatory vaccines, mark of the beast). I mean the mask thing is very similar to mark of the beast.   </p>
<p>I am also concerned that there is no end date. By the time mandates end (if they end) masks will be a normal part of society. I didn't sign up to wear this thing forever.</p>

<p>I disagree with others here in the effectiveness of masks, but my only argument is that America was built on the principles of selfishness. We have none, zero, nada obligation to take care of health of others. I don't give a flying fuck whether grandma lives or dies.

        <p>it’s not as bad as they claim it is.  Remember the horror stories of people dropping dead in the streets? Hospitals being so overwhelmed that not only would nurses NOT have time to dance in tik Tok videos and block MAGA morons in the street but body bags  would be all over the front lawns and parking lots of hospitals.  Tent hospitals would be set up in Walmart parking lots. Seriously it’s like people have been watching too many pandemic movies and assuming that’s how real life would be like. </p>
<p>Yet none of that happened.  Hell traffic in my area is back to normal </p>
<p>Also while I do wear one if I have to, I don’t do it when I don’t have to.  I just don’t like shit covering my face.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of it is tied up in the indirect implications.  Because we live in such a polarized environment seemingly remote ideas and beliefs have become contradictory.  In this case, if you are someone who is conservative, there can be a lot of cognitive dissonance for you to also think the virus is a major threat to our well-being and that its spread can be slowed down or prevented through wearing a mask.  The latter points are ones that have been consciously played down or outright denied by conservative media and pundits, and even if they are starting to walk back on it now nobody wants to consciously grapple with the fact that they were wrong.  Denial is an extremely common emotional response; it's the first stage of grief, and I would argue that we all go through a small "grieving" process whenever our beliefs or ideas undergo a fundamental change.</p>
<p>I think all this talk of "freedom" or any argument that aims at downplaying the virus or the effectiveness of masks are just convenient talking points as a person searches for a way to avoid having to reconcile with having been "wrong."</p>
<p>All of this is brought to an even greater extreme by the fact that there are people, companies and local governments who are essentially telling these people "you are wrong" through their mask mandates and requests.  The subsequent outrage that is now commonplace on /r/publicfreakout is just people getting defensive, another common human reaction.  I think whenever these interactions occur, whether it's someone deliberately calling someone else out, or whether it's someone silently coming in contact with a sign asking them to wear a mask, they are forced to make a decision: either change their beliefs, or double down.  Every time that they make the decision to hold steadfast to what they believe, it becomes further ingrained and harder to change.</p>
<p>EDIT: One more thought.  I'd love to see the normalization of changing one's mind, especially in the presence of new or different information.  I think this is something that could and should be instilled on children from a young age in school, especially in science classes.  I could be mistaken, but from what I recall most experiments we did in science labs resulted in us confirming a somewhat obvious hypothesis.  Maybe there can be more time spent on what to do when your hypothesis is wrong, or what happens more often, when it is inconclusive.  One of the arguments I see all the time that really frustrates me is when someone says "well the scientists said one thing two months ago, and now they're saying something totally different! Why should I believe them now?"  You see this argument with masks and you see it with climate change.  Politicians are constantly criticized for "flip-flopping" but I think we should all respect and applaud when someone openly changes their opinion given new data or evidence, which may evolve on a fairly rapid basis.  </p>
<p>Lastly, I think those of us who are more prone to changing our beliefs should do our best to empathize with those who are a little more "conservative" (not politically, but mentally) to their ideas and who take more time to come around to a new way of thinking.  Insults and attacks only force people to become more steadfast and less open minded in their thinking.  The most obvious fallacy I see people make is opposition, teasing, or gloating ("I told you so") when someone changes their mind.  I think this should be celebrated, but also treated as a normal occurrence that we will all undergo; obviously none of us can be right about everything the first go round.</p>

        <p>Condescension is the child of arrogance.    Great display.  </p>
<p>To the spirit of your post,, I have gone through a very serious change of mind over the last 6 months:  i thought most humans were rational and could actually think for themselves..  no longer..     it has become apparent that most of my fellow humans are weak minded fools who cannot help themselves but appeal to authority and be told how and what to think.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you feel that way.  We are all obviously victims of our circumstances and limited to the empirical evidence we see day in and day out.  So, I ask that you continue to be open minded, and I will do the same.  Take care, and I mean that sincerely with no condescension.</p>

        <p>LOL  you just can't help yourself,  condescension dripping from every word.  Im glad you have the confidence to feel so comfortable in your convictions, but it clearly would be a lost cause to attempt to explain to you that there is no empirical evidence to explain the hysteria we are all experiencing.    Turn off the media, get off social media (even reddit) and then meditate.  Maybe then your mind will actually open.</p>

        <p>Maybe condescension isn't what I meant.  The word I should have used instead was 'genuine' I was trying to sincerely wish you well, despite any difference in opinion.  </p>
<p>And to think back on your previous post, I actually think that we are in agreement regarding the irrationality of human beings.  We think emotionally not rationally and maybe that's our downfall.  </p>
<p>I am honestly trying to reassess my opinions day in and day out, but I disagree that the answer comes from total disengagement.  Social media is problematic, that's why I left facebook.  Reddit is interesting to me because you can explore all sides and opinions on an issue with relative ease.  Elsewhere in this post I saw someone claim that mask use was causing increase in dental related diseases and I asked that user for a source because that's something I hadn't heard before and I am legitimately interested in reading more about it.  It seems that it's likely that wearing a mask is a more complicated issue than purely 'good' or 'bad.'</p>
<p>In hindsight I happened upon this post while browsing new and I wasn't aware of the scope of this subreddit.  Knowing how dissenting my opinion is, I can see how you saw it as condescending and I apologize for that.</p>
<p>I sincerely and genuinely wish you well.</p>

        <p>Many of us have changed our minds. We used to be pro-mask, pro-lockdown, pro-hysteria doomers. I was all of those things, and then I switched sides, precisely because they are a massive threat to our well-being. Why do you deny that these things are a threat to our well-being? Do you lack empathy? Can you not admit that you were wrong and change your mind?</p>

        <p>Just realized that I might’ve been ambiguous in my wording, we were radicalized <em>against the new normal</em>. COVID is a giant nothingburger for the low risk. But the lockdowns do have very real and harmful effects, as in your case. I’m so sorry.</p>
