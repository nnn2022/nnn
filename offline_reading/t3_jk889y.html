        <p>television is less direct, social media and internet have multiple people personally attacking you for something you may have said or posted. it's group think, bullying, bullshit. we should all shut off the tv too, dont get me wrong, but social media rubs in your face how "heroic" all your friends are and if you dare stray from the narrative you're blocked, censored, harassed, and doxxed. i'd keep the tv over SM any day</p>

        <p>I feel you. Especially as the Corona hysteria has affected people I didn't expect to succumb to it. "Corona Derangement Syndrome", as it were. On the other hand, in my own extended family, literally everyone - including the four doctors - are opposed to the Corona hysteria and the Corona dictatorship. That was a bit of a pleasant surprise, as we're all over all the place politically - from left to right, liberal to conservative - and often argue. But instead of arguing with each other or trying to avoid hot topics, we finally all agree with each other for once. So in a way, the Corona hysteria has brought our family closer together. A pleasant surprise in an otherwise terrible year that surely has disgusted even the most pessimistic and cynical among us.</p>

        <p>Oh honey no, you've got it all mixed up - we're the bad guys. We question government, we question scientists, we question rules. We are the Nazis. We are the Karens. We are the immoral. </p>
<p>Obviously, we're being insincere when we question the effects of lockdown on the most vulnerable. Obviously, we're evil capitalists when we say the economy and people's wellbeing aren't mutually exclusive. Obviously, we're selfish for questioning the ethics of working from home whilst a poorer person delivers our amazon and food parcels. Obviously, we're gleefully killing grandma by spending important time with loved ones. Obviously, we're greedy when we try to demand medical attention for anything other than Covid. </p>

        <p>Bless you, child. You have seen that blind obedience is the only way. From now on and forevermore, we absolve of all wrongdoings and any guilt you may feel. You are merely doing your duty and following the crowd. The crowd can never be wrong. Be at peace now, you're in good company.</p>
<p>Okay so in all seriousness, I feel the same sense of hopelessness. I've always been fascinated by studies done on conformity, obedience, group influence, mob mentality etc. Watching human behaviour whilst this pandemic unfolds has been a struggle even though really, should we be surprised? People calling the police on their neighbours for having visitors? Verbally attacking people for not wearing a mask? Suggesting people should be locked in jail for questioning 'the science'? It's abhorrent but in a way, it's just history repeating itself. But though it may not feel like it, we're not alone. People are waking up and that gives me hope.</p>

        <p>Lol YES! The woke left have managed to steal the meme and turn it into something it isn't. Karen isn't some anarchist who breaks rules, she lives for arbitrary rules she can force on others and when they ignore her, she'll make her complaint. Karen was the hall monitor who snitched on her fellow students. Now she's a grown-up, she'll be watching you from her living room window so she can call the police if you're breaking lockdown rules. </p>

        <p>The Stasi in East Germany was so effective because people who had been brainwashed by the State, (or lived in fear of it) were more than willing to rat on their neighbours.</p>
<p>The same people that denounce you now for not wearing a mask, were the same that informed on their own family in the GDR, and were first in line at the book burnings in Nazi Germany.</p>

        <p>My favorite are the articles making the connection between being anti-mask and having a personality disorder. Because questioning whether something makes sense or even works somehow makes you a psychopath.</p>
<p>Those articles are becoming more and more frequent lately. Maybe because people are over wearing them and this is a last ditch effort to brand anyone not wearing it as evil nonbelievers?</p>

        <p>Ah, “stay home, save lives” my favorite. I hate the “stay home, save lives” excuse, they took that shit and ran with it, just because they hate us and want to make us feel like shit. The reason they’re saying this is because they like not working, and because they have incredible trust in authority without question, which is very frightening.</p>

<p>Yeah, I live in Canada. Had been active on that sub for quite a while too. There are a lot of news/political stories that I enjoyed discussing on there. Apparently debating COVID means I want to harm the community and that I'm spreading misinformation.</p>

        <p>The only way society can change is if people change. In other words, people need to change their values and question their own beliefs. The challenge is to break down the walls people put up to protect their egos. That's why you see most people repeating what they have been told without questioning anything even though you are stating facts...they are trying to protect their egos because if they acknowledge something to be false then what else is false? It can get scary and most people would rather live with cognitive dissonance.</p>

        <p>While it is disturbing, I believe you were originally correct about the spread of information technology. With the Internet we have places like this to get information from. Without alternative media outlets that have proliferated thanks to technology, the only source of information from outside our own social circle would be the likes of CNN. As bad as things are it would be far worse than it already is if that were the case.</p>

        <p>Yeah, actually, the only way I found out that there were other people who opposed mandatory masks and lockdowns was going online, until one of my family members also started opposing them.</p>

        <p>I think people are waking up. Albeit slowly. I dont know, it's going to reach a breaking point, you know? People dont like being told what to do. They also want to be on the winning side however. If authority looks incompetent, then they will rise up.</p>

        <p>What's your town like in general? I'm in North Jersey. Our city has a curfew (as far as I know), but the police don't give a damn. Been in effect for months. Maybe it was enforced at one point, but my town is boring too, so I presume the police didn't see a point. Anyone out past curfew is going to work or coming home from it.</p>

        <p>It is a smaller city which has farmers and nice small businesses...it gets a bad rap but it isn’t a bad place to live whatsoever. I do believe the mayor is just on some creepy power trip and hope the police can see through his bs. He was actually a corrupt official before he even got here, stealing money from another town. The police and residents here are normal average people...it just makes me upset because he is saying “for two weeks” yet we have ALL heard that line before. Not to mention the fact that they have done zero research as to why the curfewed hours nor if it will even help. It is all bc he JUsT signed like two weeks for a huge grant from mike Bloomberg to make us a “what works city” aka a “smart city”. One of 30 in the country. Found out the first one was Portland, OR...then Philadelphia...Denver...etc. So basically any city which is in flames or are having lockdowns is basically one of these cities now. We haven’t had ANY spikes in crime nor are our icu beds overflowing...quite the opposite. The death rate is dang near zero.</p>
