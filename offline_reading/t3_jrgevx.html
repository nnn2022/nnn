    <strong>Mental warfare</strong>
    <p><p>"Hope, the quintessential human delusion that is simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and weakness." </p>

<p>So i've always been someone who is an avid believer in the power of mind and our of own thoughts, and ever since march it's felt like psychological warfare. Take things away, and promise them back after you do what we say. Lmao get real, this oppression has been difficult for a lot of people, but our greatest super power as a human being is to operate on that foundation of positivity, optimism, and hope.</p>
<p>What we envision and focus on tends to manifest in objective reality. What do we hear spouted over and over again? Vaccine, "new normal", social distancing, and all the other shenanigans. This in turn causes us to operate reactively and internalize these messages (regardless if they are good or bad) and envision our objective reality in they way they want it to be manifested. That being said, this is a war for your mind. </p>
<p>Luckly, we have the freedom of thought. And no one will ever be able to take that from you. Your thought energy directly affects the reality we interact with. Operating from a positive mental framework is one of the last things they want from you. They want your creativity stifled, the truth suppressed, and division amongst us. Positive energy and hope is a plethora of all of those things! </p>
<p>I truly believe we are living in an amazing time of spiritual advancement. And your ability supercharge the world and others with your positive spirit deals a death blow to those who wish to do evil.</p></p>

        <p>Hope is the delusion. We are so complacent that we rely on someone to magically save us. We need to band together and save us. The rebels, the fighters...at what point are we going to just say fuck it what do I have to lose? Are we waiting until we lost everything?</p>
