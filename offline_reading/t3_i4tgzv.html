        <p>I know what you mean. What I find to be worse than all the mandates is the fact that many pro-maskers are taking a bigoted approach to where anti-maskers should be treated as inferior humans or as murderers. The fact that vigilantism is being used on anti-maskers is terrible.</p>
<p>Edit: I’ll wear a mask when required but I would not appreciate being shamed into doing so.</p>

        <p>Would these mask zealots still wear their masks if tomorrow the government was to declare masks banned and illegal, if you are caught wearing one then you will face fines. </p>
<p>Would they still choose to wear them and defy the law because they’re following the science? If it’s based on the science then the government’s u-turn would be unscientific. It was never about the science.</p>

        <p>The absolute cultish devotion and religious zealotry coming from these people about masks has done more to make me question their effectiveness than anything else. Also their complete lack of understanding that wearing a mask for long periods is not "easy" for many people and their are huge downsides to a masked, faceless society.</p>

        <p>This this this. I have medical issues, and contrary to what they love to spout off (“there is no valid medical reason you can’t wear a mask! Surgeons do it all day” blah blah blah), I cannot wear a mask for any decent period of time. A couple mins? Okay-ish. While I’m shopping? No. I don’t care if they seem to love to tell me and others that we <em>can</em>, they’re not me and I can’t. How can you possibly speak for an entire group of people struggling when you’re clearly not experiencing this yourself and have no ability to understand that some are? Leave me alone and I’ll leave you alone. I am constantly harassed when I’m out without a mask and even threatened. </p>
<p>I also just wish businesses would understand this too. There are exemptions in the mandates for a reason and it sucks to see them just follow the mob and appease them and not give two shits about the people that can’t. </p>
<p>Ugh rant over, sorry. I’m just sick of the mob, I’m sick of them being so mean. I’d never say the stuff they say both online and in person to anyone, and now they’re being egged on to do it by many officials. In Denver the owner of a large restaurant group said he hopes there becomes a stigma against those not wearing masks and he hopes people push that stigma. It’s infuriating.</p>

        <p>I cannot freaking stand the surgeon argument. It’s from people who don’t work in medicine and have never been in an OR before. And surgeons aren’t wearing their masks 12 hours every single day with no breaks! </p>
<p>And there’s only ~18,000 general surgeons in the US. It a really really dumb group of people to scream about since it’s such a small, very highly educated and intelligent group of people. It is literally comparing apples and oranges.</p>

        <p>I always just like to respond “well it’s a good thing I dropped pre-med!” And smile and walk away. I had my doctor, my dear doctor who has seen me through a million issues with my asthma and then PTSD from a trauma (the big reason I can’t cover my nose/mouth) and helped me so patiently through all that, use this line on me “You know, surgeons do it all day, so there’s really no reason you can’t. Guess you’re going to have to start going back to home workouts and doing curbside now”. Needless to say I will not see him anymore. </p>
<p>Surgeons are trained and have proper mask hygiene and basically, are used to it and know they can handle it. They do it and they take breaks from it, they’re not wearing it for the entire day straight with no rest, and all that. They’re not out walking/running around exerting themselves while they wear them. But also, maybe people who absolutely can’t wear masks just don’t become surgeons? That’s what I did.  Or maybe they can work up to train themselves to be able to tolerate it. Either way they knew that was part of the job and signed up knowing they can tolerate it or could get to that point over time. I never once remember signing up for having to wear one in my everyday life and choosing that.  Why does this small group of people who chose to do this have any kind of sway over what others should or should not be doing? Infuriating, it’s just a crappy argument. </p>
<p>On a final note, I’m in NYC. Most people wear masks when walking around outside. I live near a major hospital and when I see people walking around in this area without masks on, half the time it’s heathcare workers in their scrubs (with the ID badges on the lanyard so you know they’re legit). Figure enough is said with that, after wearing them all day the last thing they want to do is wear them more, and they don’t.</p>

        <p>No wonder the average person is so easily duped by the mainstream media and medical industry. Over 300 million people in the US, a little under 4 million nurses, about 1 million doctors, and not even 20,000 surgeons. The average person has near-zero medical knowledge, while the healthcare workers have too many patients to genuinely give a fuck about all of them. It doesn't help that the medical industry and education system are ran by government/corporate shills who promote a certain narrative and stomp on differing perspectives.</p>

        <p>^This! A million times this! Do these people really think that surgeons and doctors walk around in masks all day long?! They're not. They weren't doing it before Covid, and even now, they're not working a 12 hour shift without at least changing their masks (which would obviously require them to take the mask off and allow for a break). </p>
<p>My mom is a nurse and just the other day she was complaining to me about how she's annoyed that they want her to wear a mask in the freaking break room now. On her break. So yeah, the healthcare workers aren't happy about it either. Even if I was a doctor, I wouldn't want to work a 12 hour shift in a mask and then be forced to wear one when I go to the store or to a park on my day off just as how a construction worker doesn't want to wear a hard hat on their day off. If you know how unpleasant it is to work in something, the last thing you wanna do is continue wearing it during all of your free time.</p>

        <p>&rt;there is no valid medical reason you can’t wear a mask</p>
<p>I would point out that for employers to requires their employees to wear respirators, OSHA requires they have to have a medical exam showing they are healthy enough to wear it and be fit tested for the respirator.  </p>
<p>Now a respirator is not a surgical mask, but if you are wearing an N95 or other mask that forms a complete seal, they are similar enough to cause issues if you are not medically fit enough.</p>

        <p>Shaming anti-maskers is heavily promoted in MSM and people get on-board because they’ve been brainwashed into believing this is the worst &amp; deadliest virus ever.</p>
<p>I have been approached by Karens lecturing me on why I was walking next to my wife and not in a single line.</p>
<p>I tried my best not to react in a hostile way and continued on. </p>
<p>I feel bad for people who think it’s their responsibility to attack anti-maskers. They are suffering from MSM-induced hysteria, ignorance &amp; lack of independent thinking skills.</p>

        <p>What I don’t get is people’s blind unquestioning of everything they’re told and apparently short memories... </p>
<p>Wasn’t it like 2 months ago when health officials and the WHO etc said masks don’t do much? Only wear it if you’re ill otherwise it’s a waste? If it’s not N95 its not gonna stop virus getting through? </p>
<p>Then suddenly they change their mind, as if they were getting desperate and the plan is just throw whatever at covid and see if it sticks. </p>
<p>Look, I actually don’t mind the masks because it’s relatively cheap and easy compared to devastating lockdowns. If it does something, fine. </p>
<p>But turning around later and shaming people for being selfish fools for not wearing a mask when we were told for months don’t bother by the most sage in health and medicine. Wtf?? People are sheep.</p>

<p>&rt;&rt;no no no you see that was correct advice at the time because we just didn't know</p>
<p>&rt; then why didn't we err on the side of caution and have mask mandates anyway?</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;that's not how science works</p>
<p>&rt;well ok, but now we know a lot more about the lethality and prevalence. we can ease up on the closures</p>
<p>&rt;&rt; no we have no idea about longterm effects, we have to err on the side of caution until we have a vaccine</p>
<p>&rt;ok, but it'll be the fastest produced vaccine in history. Shouldn't we study the longterm effects?</p>
<p>&rt;&rt; no , that's antiscience. we have to keep mass gatherings closed until we have total vaccine adoption. Btw, coming to the BLM rally tomorrow?</p>

        <p>What pisses me off about the “pro-mask” regime is their one-size-fits-all narrative.</p>
<p>I have a panic disorder and claustrophobia. Wearing a mask that hinders proper airway mechanisms is a HUGE trigger for me. I will absolutely avoid as many places as I can that require masks for this purpose; panic attacks suck.</p>
<p>The amount of ridicule out there towards people like me is insane. There is an attack on us for not having “valid” medical reasons to not wear one. I see “If you’re sick enough to not wear a mask maybe you shouldn’t be out in public” spouted of everywhere. Shouldn’t that apply to people who are actually known risks of complications from this virus? </p>
<p>Just because you can’t physically see my medical ailment doesn’t mean it’s not real. It’s very real to me. If you’ve suffered panic attacks, you know this too.</p>
<p>So I say a big FUCK YOU to the assholes who don’t care about my medical issues. You make it easy for me to not give a fuck about yours.</p>

        <p>Yeah, even these new studies they've produced say that what "success" they've had might be the result of confounding factors. In other words, they can't say that masks are doing anything, only that they <em>might</em> help. But it could be hand-washing or a myriad other things making the (negligible) difference. It's ridiculous.  </p>
<p>Also, if I see one more person mock other people for being armchair scientists and then in the next moment post a video of a guy on Youtube proving that masks work because they block aerosol from coming through, I'm going to scream. There is a difference between showing that there's a mechanical action (physically blocking liquid from passing through) and showing evidence for actual transmission of viral infection. For people who claim to be following "the science" they sure aren't very scientific.</p>

        <p>Life will never be normal if masks are normalized. Masks are part and parcel of the larger bizarre and insane response to a 0.2% IFR virus, therefore masks are part of the lockdowns. Masks are just catering to the mass psychosis that this a far more dangerous and deadly virus than it actually is, and they are nothing but security theater and conditioning the mindless public into accepting the dystopian new (ab)normal. And ultimately, masks are the biggest symbol of the whole false narrative, and they use them to identify who is part of their cult, and shame those who show any resistance into submission.</p>

        <p>Personally my issue with masks is not whether or not they work - it's hard to argue that a face covering doesn't keep "droplets" from spreading farther than they otherwise would, it's just more about how well they work in communal settings and if they should really be mandated and forced onto the public. </p>
<p>I think sub like r/maskskepticism would still be here if they focused less on masks' effectiveness and more on pros vs cons, like the pure security theater of having to wear a mask in a restaurant but can take it off when seated, taking it off when speaking at events, maskless private gatherings that cannot be controlled, etc. There's also the psychological/dehumanizing effects masks can have, and I find it surprising that very little people talk about that. And then there's the politicization of masks - imagine having a stamp on you everywhere you go that says "I'm for abortion" or "I'm against abortion." That's what wearing (or not wearing) a mask has become. We don't have to argue about the science, because there's so many other instances where the cons outweigh the pros.</p>

        <p>I haven't worn a mask yet and here's the reasoning why it would be completely ineffective for me: I have a medical condition which means I need to eat fairly frequently outside of planned mealtimes. So when I'm out wearing a mask, I'll be removing it to eat, putting it back on, removing it to eat, putting it back on, etc etc. They say it's ok to take off your mask to eat and drink - but it's also completely useless! I'm repeatedly touching my mask to take the thing on/off. Why does it make them feel safe??</p>

        <p>Yes I do wear masks in store and places where it’s required when it’s required. But I mean I saw a homeless guy without a mask at a grocery store yesterday, i saw 2 teenagers in a building without masks....I’m not gonna take time out of my day to call the snitch line and punish the business. Nor am I going to waste time filming them and posting on social media for 👏 </p>

        <p>Same. I actually got banned from this sub a few weeks ago but they've pushed me to what I think is the normal side now. I do wear a mask but someone telling me I'm the reason there are 1000 deaths a day is ridiculous. If they want to stay home fine. I'm not even going to bars or restaurants. What do these people want?</p>
