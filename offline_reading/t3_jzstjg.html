    <strong>Do You think a scenario where we defeat the globalist agenda is even possible?</strong>
    <p><p>If You want share ur opinion...Idk if thats how people felt in the past when were facing tyranny but I dont think its ever been this bad in the known history...mainly because of how much we rely on tech and the control the powers that be have over it...I've been wondering is the globalist agenda inevitable? Cuz it feels like that...and that scares me...<br>
Too many people are high on propaganda</p></p>

        <p>I felt like you up until about a year ago. I then started seeing a shift. Now I see a <em>definite</em> shift. It's really snowballed since last year and especially since c19. I think we have a chance again. We just have to continue to snowball the information.</p>
<p>I think that's part of the reason we <em>have</em> c19 - because enlightenment and knowledge was spreading like wild fire.</p>

        <p>It’s going to be up to individuals instead of countries to strap on a pair. Find those responsibile in their area and erase them. I shouldn’t have to fly to the states to take out bill gates. One of them should. That goes both ways and there’s people here that need to go</p>

        <p>Yes, but it isn't going to be easy and it might just kill us... But the reward if we pull it off will be greater than anything you could imagine. The feeling of freedom, will be like heaven on Earth. </p>
<p>Heres how. Start small, work on yourself and think about how you spend your money, where you focus your attention. Change those things. Learn to meditate, connect to the transcendent. Support local and small businesses. This is something that can be replicated, talk to your friends about supporting local businesses. </p>
<p>Don't step foot in Walmart, stop giving Amazon any money.</p>

        <p>Most definitely in the future. We just can't determine how far into the future that may be. Could be in a few months. Few Years. Could be in the 2030s. Could be in 100 years. And i really feel a connection with people in history. This must have been exactly the way they felt, but probably even worse of course.</p>

        <p>It's been going on for millenia.  There will always be those who think they have the right to rule others.  Those who have enough knowledge and cunning to convince people they have authority and power.</p>
<p>There must always be those with similar knowledge to say, "no".</p>

        <p>This is going to long, but I will attempt to answer your question as best as I can. What I am about to say is going to piss a few folks off, but it needs saying.</p>
<p>The only way to defeat these Globalist thugs, parasites and bigots is through armed revolution and rebellion. You need to start from the top, all the way down to their enablers and collaborators. This means you need to go Thomas Jefferson on these folks, "<strong><em>the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it’s natural manure.</em></strong>" It needs to be wiped clean.</p>
<p>The system is so corrupted, that we can not have an election in the U.S. without these political thugs attempting to undermine our Constitution, and republic. It is so corrupt, that we even civilian police are enforcing their mandates under the guise of "doing my job, just following orders, or it's the law." Remember, the Nuremberg Excuse / Defense is not a valid defense.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why they took the guns from the Aussies, and Brits? Ever wonder why they keep attempting to take away our (American) firearms? These thugs have a plan, and it is our enslavement, and the price of acquiescing to these parasites ultimately them putting their boots on our backs.</p>
<p>But okay, how do we defeat them? Ever read the book the Art of War by Sun Tzu? He says, to fight, you must understand your enemy, you must think like he does, you must in essence become him. Once you understand the enemy, you must then adapt to him. So we must adapt ourselves to the enemy, and meet them tit-for-tat. They have social media behind them? Okay, good, now we develop our own. They have their own platforms to spew their rhetoric (YouTube, Google, CNN, NBC, NY Times, ABC, NBC, etc.), we create our own (Bitchute, Parler, Gab, NewsMax, OAN, etc.). Then you infiltrate them, gather information about everyone, and everything they're trying to do. You use that information to your advantage. Sun Tzu was big on spies, and that is what we need to do. </p>
<p>Also, we need to get the civilian police on our side. Too many of them, I believe, have drank the Kool-Aid, that they don't work for us any more. We need convince them, whether through coercion or however necessary that they answer to us, and serve us; that there is a consequence for violating their oaths of office. Now I know people do not want to hear that, but the globalists have pitted our own civilian police against us, and that needs to stop. And it starts by telling them who their real masters are, the people.</p>
<p>Another key element is that we need to unite. The PRESStitutes, CUNTstitutes along with their collaborators have successfully divided our country (America); they have pitted black against white, and look at the results. Imagine if we united, and we told the CUNTstitutes that we no longer believe them. They will have no power over us as a united front. Now once that message gets out, the Globalists thugs with their agenda, and collaborators will see that we are serious, that our cause is just, that we will put our lives on the line, and that we are not afraid of them, they will back down. Remember, there are more of us, then there are of them. We must stare them down by showing them we are not afraid of them, and eventually they will blink because they will know they are not in charge, we are.</p>
