        <p>I take issue with this sign and its false narrative. </p>
<p>It’s not oppression when a handful of private businesses ask customers to wear a mask and they have a choice to simply go somewhere else if they want to. It is OPPRESSIVE when you cannot enter into ANY place of business or even walk outdoors without one on because your government has deemed us all threats to one another’s health. </p>
<p>The latter is the reality I and every other resident of Los Angeles county have lived in for months now. There are no alternatives. You either comply or you cannot shop or do business in this county. How would that not constitute an oppressive measure?</p>
<p>That being said, I have never and would never yell at an employee for enforcing the law. There’s no need to be an asshole.</p>

        <p>Right. I don’t see it as oppressive when you still have a choice to shop elsewhere. But when you take away that choice and go so far as to require it outdoors at all times, that is extremely oppressive. There is no way to sugar coat that and it shouldn’t be euphemistically called an “inconvenience”.</p>

Being so mentally deranged and exhausted from years of masturbating to porn that you have turned into an absolute sociopath, plagued by anxiety and loneliness. Your only pleasure in life is ejaculating to porn several times a day.</p>

        <p>Aha? And did you miss this part of his comment:</p>

<p>I am in PA, and I have had to deal with this as well. NJ and DE, which I've also been to, have similar measures. There are no alternatives, there is nowhere else you can patron without a mask mandate, including small businesses. (Yes, people claim that these states and the likes of CA are mask-free utopias, but I have not seen this at all in months.)</p>
<p>Edit: This is also one of the fears I and many others have with the prospect of the upcoming vaccine being mandated. Masks seem to be a soft test for mandatory vaccines. What's going to happen if/when we need a "health passport" with COVID test results and vaccination records on it in order to go to anywhere/everywhere?</p>

<p>In a free country, a business has a right to refuse my patronage for not wearing a mask. A business ALSO has a right to accept my patronage when not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Laws are legislated NOT mandated therefor these mandates are NOT law, so employees and businesses are acting unconstitutionally and illegally. These people aren't being assholes they are responding in righteous anger to unjust mandates and actions.

        <p>I think we could argue that it’s both. These businesses work in collaboration with the authorities to enforce the law, while also corroborating the theory that people are a public health risk to each other and must be protected.</p>

        <p>well when some of your customers who have disabilities and can’t wear masks aren’t allowed in your shop it <em>is</em> oppression. I’m so sick of these snarky signs. I get that most businesses are doing this because they are being forced to, but when they put up signs like this that make them seem almost gleeful about it and about turning people away, yeah not going to support you anymore</p>

        <p>Oh boy do I have a list for you then:</p>
<p>Anyone with facial abnormalities or deformities affecting the mouth/nose/ears.<br>
Those with sensory issues (such as autism).<br>
Those with painful skin conditions around their mouths. <br>
Those with any sort of breathing issues including but not limited to asthma and COPD.<br>
Those with PTSD who have had traumas where something was held over their mouth by force.<br>
Those with severe anxiety for other various reasons.<br>
Those with claustrophobia.  </p>
<p>And the list goes on. If you don’t believe there are any medical reasons or disabilities that prevent mask usage, you clearly do not suffer from one of these things and therefore have no place to speak for those that do and spout off the nonsense that everyone should be able to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>And then there are the people who have severe phobias of not being able to breathe. I’m one of those people. I can’t wear a choker or a turtleneck. I still try to wear a turtleneck because I think they look super cute, but it’s not worth the hassle since I spend the entire time holding the fabric away from my neck, or it feels like my throat is closing in.</p>
<p>When I wear a mask, I am literally holding it away from my face the entire time because if I leave it against my skin, I feel like I can’t breathe and start to feel like I’m about to pass out from lack of oxygen. It’s very scary.</p>

        <p>Not sure how you still have a "right" to not wear a mask if you basically can't go anywhere or do anything in public without a mask.</p>
<p>If that's the case what's the point of making laws against discrimination?  Hey you know, you're free to be gay, it's your right.  Just don't walk into any business and expect to be served.  Don't show your gayness out on the street where people can see you lest any of them call the cops.  You can be gay.  Just not outside your home.</p>

        <p>And why exactly should businesses "choose" to require masks? Because of mass psychosis and the entirely moronic and insane response to this virus? Because of all the absurd lies and false narrative that this whole fiasco is built upon? That's not really a choice at all. They do it because it's now society's rules...the "new normal"...plain and simple. You really think anyone, business or individual would have ever made these "choices" six months ago? Absolutely not. They do it because they are participating in this mass psychosis. Tyranny and oppression from business isn't and shouldn't be any different than tyranny and oppression from government. So no, no business has a "right" to require masks. There are numerous problems with this, including the fact that as long as some places require masks and masks are normalized, you damn well will have the sanctimonious mask cult lynch mobs that will continue to harass and abuse anyone that isn't complying with their bullshit. Masks will forever become part of the very fabric of society, now deeply ingrained in the culture. That is the dystopian nightmare we're in and it will never end until all these morons are reprogrammed to not be obsessed with masks anymore and masks become abnormal again.</p>

        <p>&rt; So no, no business has a "right" to require masks. </p>
<p>I still disagree with you here. Yes, the whole pandemic is built on skewed statistics, irrational fear, etc., but how do you determine who is right or wrong? Obviously everyone thinks they're right, so how do you convince the other side that they're wrong? How do you know you're right? It's easy to interpret facts differently based on your viewpoint. So businesses and people shouldn't be forced to one side or the other, unless it is a really obvious issue like slavery or murder. Let stores that want to require masks require masks and stores that don't not require them. That way people can choose whether they want to wear a mask to go to walmart or not wear a mask at some other store. If we allow businesses to choose their policies and the people to choose where they go, it doesn't really matter who is right or wrong. Everyone can live how they want.</p>

        <p>"Everyone can just live his they want" is just absolutely ridiculous and absurd in this situation. So this whole dystopian nightmare is now a lifestyle? Horrifying. In this case there <em>absolutely is a right and a wrong</em>. It's either a low IFR virus not much worse than the common flu and none of this shit is warranted or it is the apocalyptic plague they love to LARP that requires wreaking havoc on society because it must be stopped at all costs. </p>
<p>How do we know we are right? Are you kidding here? Let me tell you how...the dozens of serological studies and other clear scientific evidence that shows that this whole thing is the most massive lie in modern history. </p>
<p>Absolutely, completely, vehemently disagree with you. You think any of this shit is normal? When has society ever reacted like this over a virus? Six months ago you and everyone else wouldn't have imagined this psychotic response in a billion years. Now you are open to the lie that perhaps some of it is warranted?  Do not let some naive "live and let live" mindset cloud your judgment here. This isn't something like "some people choose to get tattoos and some don't like them". </p>
<p>This is a psy op, the complete restructuring of society to resemble an Orwellian dystopian hellscape. It <em>is</em> completely an obvious issue like slavery or rape or murder. The fact that you are here doubting this really shows how well the extensive disinformation campaign has worked on the vast majority of people. It absolutely matters who is right and who is wrong because the most basic rights and freedoms are at stake here. The very fabric of functioning society is at stake here. The world economy is at stake here. Entire nations of people's hopes, futures, and livelihoods are at stake here. Children's development is at stake here. Everything is at stake here because idiotic and wanton destruction is being wreaked upon society on an insane level and everyone seems completely oblivious to it. We know damn well who is wrong and to accept any part of this is either extremely stupid or criminal. </p>
<p>Also would like to add, if it were truly a very dangerous and deadly virus then your mentality makes absolutely no sense that it would be okay if some people wore masks and some chose not to. If it were truly a big threat, a high IFR virus that would leave bodies in the streets, then everyone would actually have to wear masks because there would be a real risk. The fact that it somehow makes sense in your mind that "some places can require them and some not" is a tacit admission that masks are nothing but a virtue-signaling cult symbol and sign of mass hysteria...and that you know damn well that this virus is nowhere near the plague they say it is. </p>
<p>Masks and all the other dystopian shit is not a lifestyle choice, nor should it ever be treated as if it were. (The fact that this has to be pointed out truly shows how far society has fallen.) It is either necessary to wear masks because this virus is that big of a threat or it is all a complete charade and they lied about everything and created this mass psychosis of the masses believing a 0.2% respiratory virus is aersolized ebola (therefore "new normal" is a necessary sacrifice to protect us from such a terrible plague). The fact that you can't understand that proves what I've known all along...covid is a religion for people...none of this shit actually has anything to do with a virus.</p>

        <p>Technically I don’t disagree with the sign even though the person who posted it is probably a douche. I think the appropriate solution to covid is property rights. If Walmart wants to require a mask because they think that is in the self-interest of their customers and employees that is their call to make. But the government has no right to tell businesses what their policies should be or whether or not people can go places. If we would have respected property rights we would have ended up with a response more appropriate to the level of risk. </p>
<p>Instead of locking up low risk people they could go out and do things and contribute towards herd immunity. Depressed people wouldn’t have been trapped in their homes for months on end, terminally ill people wouldn’t have had to waste time in quarantine.</p>

        <p>See, this is where I completely disagree with a lot of people on this sub, who just think it's only bad when the government does it, but businesses have a license to participate in this tyrannical dystopian shit. No, I don't believe anyone has any "right" to require face diapers based on this mass psychosis. That is enabling and perpetuating the false narrative that this is a horrible plague spread by a bunch of asymptomatic people who perpetually have the virus and that masks are needed to stop it. It's completely absurd. Businesses participating in it is no different from government doing it. The dystopian "new normal" will never go away as long as masks are normalized and seen as good policy that they have a "right" to implement. All this quackery and dystopian shit is absurd. Plus, the working class are the ones who suffer the most from this shit. You think companies like Wal-Mart have a "right" to require its employees to wear muzzles on their faces for hours and hours every day? Because that damn well absolutely is tyranny and oppression.</p>

        <p>It's for this reason I actively seek out businesses that don't have a bunch of stupid senseless rules. Like, I look for restaurants that actually allow my family to come in and sit down and eat. I am not going to pay your restaurant prices to pick up the food in a bag and then go eat it on the street corner. Here in California some restaurants do and others don't. So, there clearly aren't any legal reasons why they have all these idiotic procedures. Like you can't be trusted to fill your own Diet Pepsi, because ... I don't know ... you might cough on someone.

        <p>I actual agree with this. Freedom for all, including businesses. If you don’t want to wear a mask fine! Go somewhere else. I hate masks too. And I will gladly also go somewhere else without throwing a fit. The only reason I’m wearing one is so I don’t get fired from a great job that requires it. However, once the government starts regulating and enforcing it that’s where things are very wrong. Then you can’t go down the street to a business that feels the way you do and doesn’t require it. </p>
<p>Same goes for businesses being forced to close. What if everyone who is so terrified of the flu just didn’t go to that business and didn’t worry about the people who did go to that business? And if they’re so worried about their grandma dying then advise them not to go to that business? If they go then that’s on them and that is a natural right to do so. Just like owning and operating a business should be a natural right. </p>
<p>When assessing risk, evaluate if the benefits outweigh the costs for you as an individual.</p>
