    <strong>Its extremely important to tell children none of this is normal or necessary</strong>
    <p><p>It saddens me greatly to walk around and see very young children (3+) wearing masks. Given that children cant even catch this thing...its pointless for them to wear it. But they are being conditioned to being gagged and seeing this as the world.</p>
<p>If you have children please tell them the truth. Show them films of how society is supposed to be. Tell them good always defeats evil. They must be instilled with a sense of conviction and courage to not blindly obey the next 'mandate'. </p>
<p>Cause if you dont, the very same children will soon be snatch from you and told to do such horrible things.</p>
<p>"Let the children sing aloud for theirs is the voice of purity and truth"</p></p>

        <p>Ah I always forget about that being in my late 20's, time flew. Yeah that's also a big issue, they were babies in a lot of the earlier 2000's and by the time they got on the internet and had their smart phones it was mostly how the network of things currently is and that's scary to think about. All they know is the big social media dominated wasteland.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think we really saw it starting to get out of control in 2011 because if I remember correctly that's when things starting going downhill and the sites started making changes to appeal to the general smart tech people and abandoning the older generation on computers casually using them for people that would upload their entire lives to the platforms no matter what it was without any filters. There doesn't seem like there was any solid line where the internet went from friends connecting to each other and people sharing content specific blogs that was often only there when you were on one to an update on your thoughts and feeling every 10 or so minutes on Facebook or Twitter on a phone you can't leave home without. It's a for profit and agenda data miners paradise now. Never mind mining though the control over information on the internet is insane now, it should never have gone in this direction but they saw an opportunity to do it all in a way everyone would accept and took it.</p>

        <p>Very true. I have 4 kids and discuss all this with them often. My oldest 3 basically refuse to wear masks except in very specific circumstances and for very short periods when we aren't allowed in somewhere without them. My youngest however, who is just turning 2, sees everyone in masks everywhere and thinks it's normal.. She's always grabbing masks or cloths and putting them over her face saying "I'm wearing my mask". It saddens me so much that she's been conditioned just by passively watching society around her. </p>
<p>I'm also infuriated by Costco's new policy that says if you are exempt from wearing a mask you have to wear a face shield. And only kids under 2 are exempt. Previously we followed our city's bylaw where kids under 10 were exempt and I would say I was exempt as well. Now I guess I won't be shopping at Costco.</p>

        <p>True. But my husband likes to buy in bulk because we have 4 kids and they eat, as do we. Unfortunately my husband doesn't care as much about mask mandates as I do. Though that means that, fortunately, he can now do all the grocery shopping himself.</p>

        <p>My oldest are the same.  Will only wear masks if there is no other option and only for a short time.  My 2 year old has never had a mask on.  I don’t take him enough places for him to see them enough to think it’s normal since we avoid mask required places as much as possible. We are lucky to live in a state with no mandates.</p>

        <p>That sounds awesome. Where we live (in Canada) masks are required at all public indoor places, so any grocery store, library, church... It's awful) And places are starting to make their own rules and refuse you service if you say you're exempt, even though the bylaw in our city offers exemptions and says they are to be followed. It makes me angry, we basically live under lockdown if we won't wear masks. And I refuse to force my kids to do that.</p>

        <p>Agree.  I see newborns with masks strapped on at the grocery store in baby seats.  My son can’t talk yet and YouTube kids “algorithm” puts on songs singing and dancing about masks.   Kids not socializing and thinking this is normal is not the way to set them up for success.</p>

        <p>Children often believes what they're seeing is normal because of it's the norm and rules, and that's sad!</p>
<p>Children in some countries believes facial covering is normal because of facial covering were mandatory by law some places, even pre-COVID19. Same thing is happening here!</p>
<p>Everything you sees often is seen as normal to you because of how common it's. It can be facial covering, curfews, closed businesses etc.</p>

        <p>This is probably the most infuriating part of this. Pushing off kids, oftentimes by EDUCATORS who claim they care about the kids so much, that they're carrier monkeys. This is medieval era class warfare. "Poor people dirty. Stay away leper!"</p>
<p>But in general it's all about pushing off personal accountability onto others. Personal accountability is no longer a thing.</p>

        <p>I believe you made a very valid point and am sorry OP was so dismissive. </p>
<p>This sub would probably call me a "doomer". I'm ok with masks. I'm not scared of the virus, but I don't mind throwing a mask on and social distancing because there are people who will get hurt and just like getting a flu vaccine and wearing a mask when I have a cough...I don't mind helping reduce a spread cause little bits can add up to a lot. </p>
<p>While I was open to this discussion of helping kids understand this isn't a new normal, because I want education of safety placed away from fear tactics the comment of "kids can't catch it" really turned me off. </p>
<p>We have a really close family friend who is doing pediatric ICU now and our two hospitals are diverting high risk pregnancies because neonatal icu is full. After kids are two their risks greatly improved but they aren't zero before or after. I do contact tracing for a school. Kids DO get it. They are great spreaders (especially to their families) but more asymptomatic. However the younger kids are greater about following procedures so we do see less transmission in the classroom but those rates raise as the grade does peaking in high school. Classroom transmission goes down again in college but social transmission is worse than 24+ age group. </p>
<p>This is my job, my day to day, so I know it. My student athletes are having some cardiac and clotting issues post infections. So I <em>know</em> kids get it. Doesn't mean I want them to live in fear. I want them to protect each other's grandparents and little brothers and sisters. I also tell them to wash their hands and not come in sick every year. Wear a condom, don't drink and drive, get a flu shot. </p>
<p>I guess this isn't my space, ultimately, but you are right that when misinformation is there it's a turn off when you could have an outsider join the conversation. Also, just as an FYI, the other comments comparing a mask to a religious face covering feel very xenophobic and makes me feel very uncomfortable. I understand some folks may not approve of that custom, but my decision on whether or not I think wearing a mask is a good public health policy is not going to be influenced by decisions of a culture which do it for different motivations. </p>
<p>Again, this obviously isn't my space and my opinion may be irrelevant but as an outsider I wanted to share why it would be difficult for me to approach this decision or this group and share I think you have a valid point.</p>

<p>I agree with most of your sentiments therein but these have almost roundly been proven to be useless from year to year even though they've been pushing the flu shot for years now. But what better way to make it mandatory than a pandemic?</p>

        <p>Effective rates are over all in the 60ish percent range with toddlers, HIV, and adults under 50 closer to 70 percent range? My students fall in one of the more effective age ranges and live in shared housing, usually with subpar hygiene standards, and a love of exchanging body fluids. </p>
<p>60-70% percent effective can make a difference in those situations. </p>
<p>Now with me, personal experience weighs heavily.  Personally I've had the flu twice with no vaccine, confirmed once with vaccine, and suspected once with vaccine. The first time I had it was in college and that was the worst two weeks of my life. I had nightmares of being buried alive because of the weight of the blankets was painful to my body, but I couldn't curl up because touching my own skin was painfully hot from the fever. </p>
<p>I was really good about getting flu shots after that. One year my good friend got the flu but I only got a mild cold so I figured I didn't catch it, but never confirmed. </p>
<p>Almost two decades later I get sent on a surprise business trip and had to cancel my appointment to get one. Yeah I could've walked in any place and got one but it just slipped my mind. My husband who never gets a flu shot brought home the flu that year. Our kids, who had the vaccine that year, one tested negative and one tested positive and the positive had minor symptoms. It took my husband 3 weeks to recover and since he had his diagnosis, I got Tamiflu at the first sign of fever and my recovery was only a miserable week of active symptoms and another week of low energy. </p>
<p>Then one year we had an outbreak at the office and yes I got it, but had the vaccine that season and very minor symptoms. No one else is my family for sick. Only tested because of the exposure and it was the secondary stand that season not the first. </p>
<p>Anyhow, if any of us experienced issues with the vaccine I wouldn't recommend it for slightly better than flipping a coin but we've had no issues and it's been effective in our family. Even the reduction in symptoms I am thankful for. </p>
<p>My husband has an autoimmune disorder and when they went to prescribe his current medicine they warned him 50 percent of the time it's not effective for your condition. However his condition was so bad it was a "this is our best chance without surgery". He still tried it because 50 percent is still a chance. </p>
<p>So I get your point, but I still think it has a place.</p>

        <p>I have young kids (all 4 and under).  I don’t make them wear masks.  We have always been a patriotic family...military, teach them to say the pledge...but lately with my oldest I have started dialogue about freedom and how being American means being free.

<p>I agree with you. what makes me angry is how the US military was ruining millions of lives in the middle east, africa, south america, east asia for half a century in the name of the same democracy you say they upheld.</p>
<p>I think we are seeing a case of judgement back on America. The very same veterans who were out there violating human rights will have their own rights violated by the same oppressive state. </p>

        <p>This is so fucking stupid. The veterans who defended those freedoms are almost entirely dead, at this point.</p>
<p>The veterans from more recent wars in the middle East weren't protecting anyone's freedom but the oil barons - freedom to steal cheap oil for massive profit.</p>

        <p>Not relevant. I believe veterans should be taken care of when they get home from serving, regardless of where they were.</p>
<p>That doesn't change the fact that the United States hasn't been in a war since WWII that was about defending freedoms.</p>
<p>Every war since then has been about imposing American foreign policy abroad.</p>

        <p>My nephew who is 7 told me he hates wearing masks at school cause he can't breathe... 
His neighbor friend is also terrified of him now and freaks out if he comes to close. The kid just stands across the street watching him (my nephew) play outside... It's so sad. 
I just had my first kid I would never put a mask on them ever.</p>

        <p>Totally agree with you - it's so sad to see the effect of all of this propaganda  on children who haven't been fortunate enough to be raised by sane parents. The other day, my friend and I were at the beach and had just walked up around 12 flights of stairs that led to the cliff above from the shore. He has trouble breathing often and was completely out of breath after we reached the top - it certainly would have been almost impossible for him to put on a mask at that point. As I waited for him to try to catch his breath, a father and two kids, each around 5 or so, approached us.  When they were around 15 feet away from us, the father looked expectantly at his kids, who immediately covered their face with the towel they were carrying and stared at us fearfully. They got a little closer, at which point the son pointed at us and said "[something] mask.." (he could barely speak). The father smiled eagerly at him then looked up at us smugly and said "ta mask" or whatever it was the kid said then stared at us until we did something. I  kinda nervously laughed and said, "haha cute kid" or something before walking away. As I glanced back, I saw the father was looking down at his kids and smiling like wtf? oh yeah also we were over 6 feet apart from them this entire time</p>
