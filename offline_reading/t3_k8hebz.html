        <p>If it doesn't mean zero COVID, why release it? Just let it run its course. It worked in Sweden, but I guess it no longer exists.</p>

        <p>Who cares what they want.</p>
<p>They wanted to start the same hysteria with ebola, and than the news hit that to get ebola you need to literally eat another person's feces, so ebola cannot spread to countries with working plumbing systems. Ebola also can be cured with just IV fluids, which makes it non-deadly in any country that has basic hospitals. Hype stopped quickly, but Moderna even had time to develop a vaccine. They didn't get what they wanted.</p>

        <p>There is no example of 'new normal' in history. Holocaust ended up very quickly, soviet repressions of 1930s ended up inevitably in communist part condeming it's own policies (and pardoning everyone who went to gulag), etc etc etc. Craziness never lasts.</p>
<p>Permanent sanitary dictatorship is a temporary delusion. Public opinion matters. People only function if there is hope at the end of the tunnel. Hope is vaccine. If they say 'well, vaccine is like a mask - it doesnt really work', then people riot. People already are pissed because of lies ('evolving opinions') around the mask, and that's just a mask, vaccine is way more serious. Vaccine has to work period. If vaccine works, it's lights out for COVID cult. If vaccine doesn't work, people riot and the state will be demolished, so there will be no one to enforce these lockdowns anyways. </p>
<p>My point is that it is very profitable for 'deep state' for you to be depressed. They don't care which way you get depressed - either you get depressed fearing COVID, or you get depressed fearing NWO, they need you to be depressed, so that you stay weak and they can compete against you. I am not accepting to be depressed. Normal life always returns, and it always happen quickly.</p>

<p>Normal life is never coming back, they already said so.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"If vaccine works, it's lights out for COVID cult."</p>
<p>Nope. Klaus already said we're going to have a cyber attack or something.</p>

<p>"If vaccine doesn't work, people riot and the state will be demolished, so there will be no one to enforce these lockdowns anyways."</p>
<p>The "vaccine" isn't supposed to work, it only lessens the symptoms and doesn't stop the spread of the virus, meaning we'll have to physically distance and wear masks even after the "vaccine". Plus there's the whole thing about making you sterile after you take it.</p>
<p>If people revolt, they'll propose Martial Law and nobody wins.</p>

        <p>Well Hitler also said that Reich will last a 1000 years, did it really happen? Saying things doesn't make them happen. Wanting things doesn't make them happen either.</p>
<p>If vaccine doesn't work, people will get sick of this BS, and I am not talking nonewnormallers, regular everyday sheeple normies will riot. Sheeps riot too, they are animals at the end of the day, and controlling the herd is a lot harder than you think.</p>
<p>It is your human right to give up, but by spreading your depression around you are not helping out. If you give up, you basically accept NWO.</p>

        <p>How are you different from covid cultists? Who would ever want to wear a mask that makes your face sweat and doesn't allow you to breath well? Who would want to be deprived of social interactions, who would want to not be able to go to a gym/pool/casino/rock concert? </p>
<p>No sane person wants this. They sold us BS twice by moving goal posts, "just wait till we secure enough ppe", "just wait till we have a vaccine", but goal posts can be moved only several times, no one's patience is infinite. </p>
<p>I have several sheeple friends, and I know exactly how much patience they have left. Not too much.</p>

        <p>I'm not going to argue with you. There's not going to be revolt/civil war/whatever that will happen. We're at the point of no return. There is no undoing the damage done by these lockdowns. Every day we continue with this charade we are only plunging ourselves deeper into economic devastation and a mental health crisis unlike anything in modern times.</p>

        <p>Says who? There are no examples of revolts or civil wars in human history? There are plenty of examples, and this is usually happens when the elite tries to drag the craziness (facism, slavery, hereditary aristocracy) way past the expiration date. So human kind is pretty simple: either the government stops doing crazy stuff on it's own, or there's a revolution. In either case, craziness doesn't life, and the 'old normal' prevails. </p>
<p>When you say 'They gonna do whatever they want to the people and nothing will happen' and the deep state says 'We will do whatever you want to you and nothing will happen', what's the difference? It is the same exact delusion. Delusions are temporary. There are limits to everything. Past the limits, something happens.</p>

        <p>Zero COVID is not needed. If every immunocompromised person can be reliably vaccinanted, why fight to eradicate the virus? It's just a cold. Flu vaccine didn't eradicate the flu, yet it is still very helpful to elderly and immuncompromised.</p>

        <p>It's over, folks. They are admitting a vaccine won't mean zero covid (something we all knew from the start), so a few cases will still pop here and there. As long as there is 1 case, the media will freak out about it, politicians will follow the media, and people will be scared.</p>
