    <strong>Ensure negative on PCR test?</strong>
    <p><p>So this is not a question on how to fake test documents or anything, and also I am against the PCR test being used to stifle our freedoms. </p>
<p>In this sub I hope most are aware this farce of a test was stated by its inventor Kary Mullis as not being fit for diagnosing any illness or virus but only for forensic use. </p>
<p>This is right as he died 2 months before this fakedemic started, sadly using his own test to create "asymptomatic" cases of perfectly healthy people treated as if they are plagued.</p>
<p>My question to the wise folk here is: is there any information out there on how to ensure or increase likelihood of not flagging a false positive on this bogus test, if one is in a situation where one is forced to take it (emergency travel and so on)?</p>
<p>Are there any reports linking diet, lifestyle, medications, exposure to cold / flu or anything else as factors in this thing turning up red, so as to be able to prepare in advance to reduce chances of a positive in an upcoming test? </p>
<p>I've seen folk turn up positive after multiple negatives even after being in quarantine for 21 days, so I'm not buying the bs explanation of "tHeY cAuGhT cOvId". There is something else internally which can flag this thing and I'm just wondering if there's any info on this.</p></p>

        <p>It's pretty easy to turn out false positives, more so than false negatives even, from what I've read. Tweaking the cycle threshold just slightly skews results dramatically. PCR tests in general are absolute bogus and I'm not sure there's anything you can do per say to avoid coming up with a positive test in advance as far as lifestyle goes, other than either avoid the test or fake it.</p>
