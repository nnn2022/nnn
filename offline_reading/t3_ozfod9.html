    <strong>I‚Äôm not trolling, I‚Äôm just curious.</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>How do you guys react to people infected with covid? Do you just brush it off and ignore it or something?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the vaccine is some toxic substance (that substance being a liquid), wouldn‚Äôt it just be easier for the government to release it into the air, or in the water supply?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, couldn‚Äôt the government just use your phone to control you? We have it on our person almost every hour of the day. In fact, an IP address can reveal names, actual addresses, credit cards, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I‚Äôm not a troll, just curious.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, no prob. There was actually a study done a few months ago that showed that subs like this are actually more based in evidence and factual information than pro-NN ones. We're not nearly as insane as the media would have you believe. They resort to attacking our sanity and character because they know they can't attack the information.

<p>2) I mean...why don't they release the vaccine into the air? I don't think this is how it works.</p>

        <p>1)covid is real.
2) it's not some toxic substance, the part with long term harmful effects is the spike protein that is present in both the virus and the vaccine. 
3) the government has had the ability and has been spying on its citizens since ww2. This isn't about that. There's a global depopulation agenda that has influenced this and most major events since 1945. United Nations agenda 21. We are running out of time to save the planet from irreversible damage and the only way to stop it is to drastically reduce the population. Other measures have not been effective. We either get rid of many people or all perish. This has been hidden from the public to avoid mass chaos. Many people are aware of certain parts of what's going on but few have figured out what the agenda is. More people are finding out. The great awakening humanity is supposed to have that will radicalize society is this revelation.</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt think the vaccine is toxic, but if the government isn‚Äôt offering anything in return why take it? If everything is still restricted and you gotta wear a mask, still may have lockdowns why do I need it. I‚Äôm not afraid of the virus. The show has been going on for 18 months, we‚Äôve been complying for 18 months yet here we are still in the same situation. </p>
<p>Life needs to go on eventually, people are underestimating how long the governments can push this thing. 3-4 years from now will we still be in this? </p>
<p>In short, for me to take the vaccine, life would have to go back to 100% normalcy, no half way to normalcy. </p>
<p>Hope that makes sense :)</p>

<p>The same way I react to anyone in society getting a respiratory infection (which has happened to human beings since the dawn of time). I‚Äôd reach out offer to help them however I can if they‚Äôre someone I care about. Non-reaction/general wishes of well-being if it‚Äôs a stranger. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hmm, this question seems to imply some weird conspiratorial motive on the part of the government with respect to the vaccine. I‚Äôm not sure if I subscribe to that. My general view, which is informed in part my talking to friends of mine who are physicians in NYC, is that adverse reactions are being severely downplayed and undercounted by medical and governmental institutions. When I consider the risk of COVID for someone in my age group (it‚Äôs astronomically low for someone below 40), I think it‚Äôs outweighed by the risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. The adverse reactions that I‚Äôve personally witnessed have been rare but severe (requiring hospitalization and in one case resulting in death). Most of the people my age that I know and that has COVID were asymptomatic. I‚Äôll take the risk with COVID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government is tracking us with our phones. Doubt anyone where would deny that. Your question implies that ‚Äúwe‚Äù think the vaccine is being used for some kind of tracking purpose, and I don‚Äôt think anyone here has ever espoused that.</p>

        <p>&rt;How do you guys react to people infected with covid? Do you just brush it off and ignore it or something?</p>
<p>I've never known anyone IRL that has had covid.  And I work in a school that was open all last year. In a province that has been pretty much open for the last 12 months.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If the vaccine is some toxic substance (that substance being a liquid), wouldn‚Äôt it just be easier for the government to release it into the air, or in the water supply?</p>
<p>I don't want to take the shot because the odds of me dying from Covid are next to non-existant.  In my country 94% of people that died from Covid were over the age of 65, and none of those deaths were excess deaths in that age group.  Essentially those people were going to die anyway, covid or no covid.  Getting a shot that has a chance of harming me, a shot that even if I get the shot I can still catch and spread Covid to the elderly,  a shot that could harm me in order to protect people that are going to die anyway is stupid.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Lastly, couldn‚Äôt the government just use your phone to control you? We have it on our person almost every hour of the day. In fact, an IP address can reveal names, actual addresses, credit cards, etc.</p>
<p>I don't believe the government is trying to control me.  I think it's the ultra rich playing with us in order to line their pockets with more and more cash.  And sadly the ultra rich own the governments.</p>

        <p>1) What is the appropriate reaction in your mind? </p>
<p>2) Honestly, how do you think the vaccine works? Do you think that you could eat any vaccine and it would work? More importantly, in your own words, can you summarize how this vaccine stimulates your immune system? Like, biologically what is happening inside your body after you're injected? Because based on this question, it seems like you have a very misinformed idea of how this, or any vaccine works.</p>

<p>The same as if they had a cold or caught flu. Tell them to rest and hope they feel better soon. If they're really sick, encourage them to contact a doctor. </p>

<p>No, because then they and their families will get it, too. They can't separate their air from everyone else's air. Water is possible for the highest elites but it's still risky, and not all of them can have their own private water supply like that.</p>

<li>
<p>Not everyone carries a cell phone everywhere. I usually leave my phone at home when I go out, except to work. Cell phones are optional. They already know your name and where you live even if you don't have a phone.</p>

        <p>1 Likely the same as you do. Not be around sick people, but have compassion &amp; try to help. (Or are you a 'they should DIE!' type?)</p>
<p>2 Not really, no. Just logistically it would be near impossible. (Same reason that's not how they are 'vaxxing' populations)</p>
<p>3 Control? Can you try to explain what you mean by that?</p>
