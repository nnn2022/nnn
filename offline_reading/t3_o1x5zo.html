        <p>I knew this was bullshit from the beginning. I was following this in October before anyone knew covid would "spread" around the world.</p>
<p>I used to work in shipping and in December 2019 some real weird shit happened with the large orders my company was making. All the sudden our orders were not being processed and every regional manager had no idea why. There were no shortages and they acknowledged that this was highly unusual. Silence from corporate HQ, we were working with two different major retailers.  </p>
<p>Then March happened and when Abbott announced Texas's shutdown me and my wife knew the end game was here. This is a wealth grab and the "virus" is a cover. After they put the plexi-glass and those stupid stickers on the ground simultaneously literally overnight across the state it couldn't have been more obvious, to me at least.</p>
<p>This is why I have never worn a mask or social distanced or any of that ridiculous bullshit because well.....it's bullshit. It was hard though because 99%  of people were scared like y'all and no one would listen. Then I found this sub when it was 5k when we actually posted scientific studies and government documents proving the farce. Oh have things changed.....</p>

        <p>I think wading through shit posts because more people are waking up and climbing on board is a fair trade-off.</p>
<p>The info came out right away before censorship slammed the door that it was SARS spliced with HIV, and that the first case was in September of ‘19 in Wuhan. But you had to be in the wuhan_flu sub to see it, which they almost immediately quarantined and deemed r/ coronavirus the official sub, and then heavily, heavily censored it.</p>

        <p>Well I watch The Last American Vagabond hosted by Ryan Christian and he was covering the strange respiratory illness in Ft Detrik Maryland that is very similar to Covid early summer of 2019.</p>
<p>Now Ft Detrik BSL 4 lab has strong ties to the Wuhan lab, one reason I think the MSM is embracing the Wuhan theory now to deflect the US involvement.</p>

        <p>I also was never afraid. I survived the opiate epidemic (sober 8 years) and have an extremely healthy lifestyle. A virus isn't scary to me. I also am not interested in putting drugs and needles in my body, especially when people I don't know tell me to. I spent my entire youth around liars and expert manipulators, so the BS was clear from the beginning to me. I don't give in to peer pressure and I don't trust people that haven't earned my trust so I'll be keeping drugs of any kind out of my body unless I'm completely incapacitated.</p>

        <p>The thing with that though is that it’s mostly too late to wake up. The jab is irreversible, so even <em>if</em> they’re starting to second guess it all, they’re aware that there’s nothing they can do because it’s already in them. So then they double down and go into denial about it all to try and block out the fact they’re doomed</p>

        <p>Here’s where my mind went: what better way to reenforce the narrative than to have NFL players say they got it and are fine. Will they really get it? Who can say. Do we honestly think, seeing the stats, a billion-dollar industry is going to risk taking out their money-makers? What kind of side deals were the players offered? So many variables.</p>

        <p>I Agree.</p>
<p>And here's why. Pro Sports are big on Black Lives Matter, especially the NBA. And pro sports teams are composed of a larger percentage black athletes compared to the general population. And since this vaccine is harmful, what do they mean by Black Lives Matter when making their professional lives suck if they don't get the vaccine. Ugh.</p>

        <p>Hilarious - if you're vaccinated you are no longer required to test? That alone should be obvious this is all propaganda virtue signaling, if vaccines aren't 100% effective (they aren't), and tests aren't bullshit(they are) then there is NO reason to stop testing people if they receive a vaccine. What about the asymptomatic spread?! Guess its fine for the virus to spread as long as the carriers are obedient and don't question authority.</p>

        <p>This type of rule is what the CDC will use to argue that the unvaccinated are causing Covid cases to rise and variants to flourish. If you don’t get tested you can’t be positive. Forcing unvaccinated to be tested and allowing vaccinated to skip the test is no scientific way to track the spread.</p>

        <p>NFL players, despite being a picture of peak athletic performance, are also not that far off from a catastrophic medical emergency at any given time. They are pushing their bodies to the edge of what's possible, and depending on their position, subjecting themselves to constant traumatic brain injury and crazy high bmi's. For non-Americans, it's uncommon for high school football players to die from heat exhaustion during summer two-a-day training, but it does happen. </p>
<p>Now introduce a spike protein into their body and see what happens...whew. In a sport where the vast majority of players are black, and thus have a higher risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.</p>

        <p>No quarantine after exposure for vaccinated players? Even the pro vaccine folks say that it's not 100% effective. </p>
<p>If a vaccinated player catches it and spreads it to his unvaccinated teammates, that is not a concern according to the NFL.</p>
<p>But if an unvaccinated player is in the same room as someone who tested positive (Vax or not), they have to be locked away.</p>

        <p>What the heck does medical status have to do with marketing or sponsorship opportunities? The others are based on faulty information, but are internally consistent. That one stands out as unrelated and makes it obvious that this has more to do with punishing the ones who aren't submissive enough than health.</p>
