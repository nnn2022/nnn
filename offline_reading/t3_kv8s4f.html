    <strong>"The Whole Picture"</strong>
    <p><p>In our society, as we see it, many people use the TV as their only source of thought. To this I say, it is unreasonably foolish. However, we cannot blame them. Ever since we are young, we're programmed to do, say, and listen to authoritative figures without ever questioning it. But the thing is, we still questioned anyway. It is human nature to question the world around us. So, why did we stop? No matter what we've been told, question it. We need to start taking a step back and look at the whole picture. If there's anything we learned in this past year, it is that we need to question our reality. After all, this world is only shaped by those who write the story. It is crafted maliciously by those in control. Whatever you may see or hear on the news or world wide web, always question. Many have failed to question why we were going against our current values as a society, just to escape a flu strain.</p>
<p>As the one year mark approaches, I think it is time that we start teaching other people HOW to think. We need to tell them, "You have a brain, learn how to use it". People need to start thinking freely! We need independent thought! Once other people start thinking, they won't need us to tell them what's going on since it's so blatantly obvious. See the world for it is with your eyes, not through a television screen.</p>
