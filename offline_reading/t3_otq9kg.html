    <strong>If all people had no internet or media whatsoever for the past two years, would they know there is a pandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>Or would they just assume that the symptoms people describe to one another are the cold or flu? I'm asking a serious question and I'm not trying to imply that the virus is fake (I don't care though if someone thinks it's fake).</p></p>

        <p>They wouldn’t know it here in Alberta unless maybe they worked in a nursing home. In which case it would simply be a rumour that “there’s a bad bug going around with the seniors”.</p>
<p>I personally don’t know anyone who has been seriously affected by Covid. Heard about a few elderly dying from it secondhand.</p>

        <p>The people that I know who got covid were my best friend, my sister and brother-in-law, and my aunt. They said it was very mild, a mild sore throat and a mild cough and my sister and brother-in-law said it was like a mild sinus infection. She said she actually felt worse when she had an actual sinus infection then she did from this covid-19 business. </p>
<p>One lady at my work had covid really really bad but she's a fucking fat ass and she also has an autoimmune disorder.</p>
<p>A couple people I spoke to on the internet in different chat rooms told me they had covid really really bad and had to be put on ventilators but same thing, they were either morbidly obese or had some other comorbidity.</p>

        <p>People might have a bit of knowledge that something was going on, but there would not be widespread panic.</p>
<p>If we even went back in technology by 5-10 years, this would be over. The people who love lockdown because they can work from home wouldn't have been able to do that. 2 weeks, maybe you could do that. They would not have put up with being locked down for months or years.</p>

        <p>Things seem to have changed around 2000. There were quite a few disease scares during the Bush and Obama years, like SARS, bird flu, swine flu, and Ebola. Having grown up in the 1990s myself, I don't remember any similar panics during the Clinton years.</p>
<p>While I think that this disease panic is a relatively recent thing fueled by the internet, I don't think it's quite as recent as people on here make it out to be. In 1990, I doubt anybody would have known that COVID existed, let alone cared about it. By 2010, that would have been a whole different story.</p>

        <p>I remember talking about swine flu because it was in the news, but never knew anybody who had it or was impacted by it. It was just a passing topic for a period of weeks or however long. Now it's constant.</p>
<p>I think there was more attention paid to Ebola, which ended up killing thousands, I believe all in Africa. That was 150 million additional Twitter users later.</p>
<p>We've made comparisons before between covid and the Hong Kong flu, which occurred in 1968-1969. We had a Presidential election (in person voting), Olympics, Vietnam War, Woodstock, moon landing, the funeral of C.N. Annadurai (15 million people), Millions of people died, but life went on like normal.</p>

        <p>Covid was already circulating in the US in November 2019. Life was normal until March 2020. Concerts, sporting events, schools in session, travel etc all took place and hospitals were not overwhelmed. </p>

        <p>I think it spread around my former workplace before it was known to be in the US, after my roommate got back from China (we worked together, and I don’t blame them for it, but we got sick and then almost everyone else did).</p>
<p>No one died or got hospitalized, a lot of people just called in sick. Like a bad flu season.</p>

        <p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Have your parents or grandparents ever talked about the 1957 or 1968 flus with you? Heck, if you're an older person, do you remember anything about those flus yourself?</p>
<p>Those flus were every bit as bad as COVID.</p>

        <p>Maybe they would've spread their propaganda by other media, like newspapers or TV shows, but the most important thing about it is, if we had no internet this whole home office bs would have been impossible, so people would have continue to come into work. And social media is the perfect brainwashing machine by social conditioning all these people into conformism.</p>

        <p>The number of dead people would probably be a good hint.<br>
The numbers are high even with public measures and health awareness. I don't even want to imagine how many would die if we weren't informed.</p>
