    <strong>These measures don’t really work</strong>
    <p><p>So thanksgiving we had a family get together   Like 20 people   My grandma didn’t come because she was worried about getting sick and my aunt stayed home with her   So it was my cousins who came from Texas and the rest of my cousins from here (NY/NJ)   My cousin was sick that day and infected more than half of us there    No one cared, no one shamed anyone shit happens.  It sucks to be sick but we’re over it    No one had it bad.  So we came into contact with our aunt who didn’t come (lives with my grandma) and she right away stayed away from my grandma and everything.  Wore a mask if they were in the same room, gloves, wiped down shit with Lysol   The whole thing. Got tested and was positive and then moved to the basement of their house to be away from my grandma.   About 5 days after my aunt was positive my grandma developed symptoms and is in fact positive. So after they took all these measures they claim work my grandma STILL got it   And so far she’s good. Sick yes but not gasping for air.  She’s at home resting up.  Even for older people it’s not an automatic death sentence.  Unless you truly isolate yourself from the world and wait to get this rushed vaccine you’re bound to get it at some point    Sorry.  Idk why we’re shaming people nowadays for getting sick. It’s disturbing   You’re more than likely going to get this thing it’s THE SCIENCE they talk about   Destroying economies for this virus isn’t worth it    Yea if this was like the plague, say no more I’m staying home on my own</p></p>

        <p>I think the lockdowns “work” - in that they work to shift the burden of exposure onto the working class and spare the affluent WFH class from getting the sniffles.</p>
<p>They certainly don’t work to reduce the number of people that will inevitably get infected but they do seem to benefit the rich and privileged rather nicely at very little cost to them.</p>
<p>Totally baffles me how they were able to convince everyone this was the moral path.</p>

        <p>Yep. Amazing I have a friend who’s finishing up law school.  He says he is a socialist and is the biggest supporter of lockdowns   His dad is a top lawyer, grandfather worked on Wall Street left a shit ton to my friends mother (she was an only child)   Lives in a 4 million dollar (8000 square foot) mansion     He moved out of his Manhattan apartment when everything went down and has been at his parents house since.  It’s easy for him to say stay home when he’s got a gym, sauna, movie theatre and a nice pool at his house    The best part is that he talks about the wealth inequality</p>

        <p>So what's your point?  Irresponsible deniers got together for a holiday and are now sick, like thousands of people that gathered on Thanksgiving days and got sick days after, no surprise.   The <em>measures</em> do work for those who are careful, we are not sick now.</p>

Since when did we shame people for getting sick dumbass?  Now all of a sudden we shame them   MY BODY MY CHOICE. Remember when that mattered to you guys?    My grandma and aunt didn’t come   Read the post and you’ll see how my aunt and grandma took the crazy measures after and still both of them got it</p>

        <p>So what? People get sick all the time.</p>
<p>So, one more time: No one was seriously ill, no one wound up in the hospital, and no one died. From OP's description, the symptoms were mild, just like the vast majority of cases.</p>

        <p>Everyone gets sick at this time of the year. It’s winter. It’s cold &amp; flu season. What, have you never been sick before coronavirus? All the symptoms are identical to the common cold. Hanging out with friends and family doesn’t make me irresponsible, it makes me a mentally stable human being. </p>
<p>There is nothing to deny, the virus just isn’t as deadly as you think it is. Maybe you got used to living like a lazy antisocial recluse, but that life isn’t for the rest of us. The economy is collapsing, people are losing their jobs and young people are killing themselves.</p>

        <p>No, they aren't. The common cold does not give you heart pain, sock you down in a chair for 4 days, and give you a massive nosebleed on the last day of infection.</p>
<p>That is my personal experience with this virus.</p>
<p>It also does not kill 2 69 year olds, one admittedly in what would be called 'poor health' and one that was healthier than me when I got the coronavirus named Dad and Mom respectively.</p>
<p>Time to wake up here: This is a DEADLY illness for people and the damned scary thing is that it is exceptionally chaotic in whom it targets for death.</p>

        <p>All illnesses are chaotic in who the target. Are you aware of how many healthy kids die from the flu every year? Way more than Covid. Yet my immunocompromised parents have both survived it. 
I would argue that the common flu is WAY more unpredictable in who it kills.</p>

        <p>Nobody got seriously ill, nobody wound up in the hospital, and nobody died. Everyone who was infected had more or less mild symptoms. That's the point.</p>
<p>We've destroyed the economy and people's businesses for a virus that causes mild symptoms, and sometimes none at all in the vast majority of people. A more intelligent response would have been to identify the people who are most likely to have serious complications, such as those with compromised immune systems, and isolate them. </p>
<p>But we can't do that because that would single them out, and if a few people have to suffer, then everyone has to suffer. Except if you're a democrat in high office, then you can do whatever you please and the MSM will give you a free pass.</p>
