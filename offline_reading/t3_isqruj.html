    <strong>Every university subreddit is full of doomers</strong>
    <p><p>Even though the chance of a college student dying from the meme flu is incredibly low, students are still filing complaints to the state about their school and ratting out kids who dare break the rules of the new normal. Anyone who posts something questioning the “science” gets downvoted into oblivion. </p>
<p>I understand that students who use reddit are more likely to engage in this neckbeard tier behavior, but I don’t see how they haven’t realized that this quarantine shit doesn’t work, we’ve been wearing the stupid face diapers and social distancing for 6 months now and absolutely nothing has changed. Diseases don’t just disappear this way we need to get herd immunity. </p>
<p>I’m out here going into debt to join fucking zoom calls. Watch this shit disappear if Biden gets elected.</p></p>

        <p>That's not actually correct.  Science is consensus.  It happens in paradigms and those acting outside of the current paradigm are not practicing science.  If the current consensus of scientists says that masks are beneficial, those who say they are not are not even practicing science. For a deeper dive on the philosophy of science read some Thomas Kuhn about scientific revolutions.</p>

Anyone who analyzes data this way is a "scientist". Philosophy has no bearing on the scientific method. I don't care about your examples because they are not relevant to our discussion topic.</p>

        <p>&rt;Philosophy has no bearing on the scientific method. </p>
<p>So when does data establish correlation?  How strong does the r need to be?  These are philosophy questions.</p>
<p>Your observations are based on your senses, but your senses are incomplete to describe the physical world.  Ultraviolet and infrared light for example? Science is philosophy - it is empiricism.  </p>
<p>But getting back to topic, the scientific method, "as you described", does not account for peer review and publication; measures in place to make sure people aren't cheating.  Just another example of required scientific consensus in support of Kuhn.  </p>
<p>Does that mean Joe down the street isn't doing science in his garage...no, not necessarily.  Just that he's not going to get anywhere until others verify his work.  This is how we make sure pseudoscience doesn't screw everything up and people are following the method.  It doesn't mean it's not science, "as you described", it just means without consensus, it's worthless.</p>
<p>Edit:  "as you described"</p>

        <p>Look at the history of science, it is full of things that were wrong.  That's how it works.  It's right until something better comes along and the consensus of scientists change their minds - that is how paradigms shift and scientific revolution occurs.  Please don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying consensus is the majority of everyday people, that would just be ignorant.  I'm saying it is the majority of scientists.  The consensus is just whatever most scientists believe at any given moment.</p>

        <p>1) Not my theory, Thomas Kuhn's, feel free to discuss it; not discussing it sounds a lot like you're being lazy, ignorqnt or just anti-intellectual.
2) Just because you want to be a lazy thinker doesn't mean everyone does.  Some people actually care about keeping science scientific and gatekeeping quacks and religious nuts.
3) Never have I said don't follow the scientific method (so that's pretty shitty strawman).</p>

        <p>It tells me that scientific progress is difficult and slow (and probably a little messy).  It tells me that fake science will always be around, calling itself science, and waiting for the distributed mass of academics to shut it down (or alternatively accept it and shift).  It also draws a bright line between experts and nonexperts.  And that's the way things should be because not everybody gets to be a scientist or devote their life and work to a branch of science.  Mere access to information doesn't make someone a scientist and having an opinion doesn't make that opinion important or valuable.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that science is quite difficult and slow, especially to get a consensus. Physicists are still arguing about how quarks move in space and what are their properties. But most science does not control public policies. For example, behavioral scientists have been studying prisons and confinements and found almost unanimously that confinement, especially solitary confinement, is detrimental to the human psyche. But are there sweeping changes in the works? No. Ten percent of the US population is or has been in a US prison, yet these people are not considered as important to evaluating our quality of life to the big wigs controlling policy in thi great US of A. Don't tell me that the government cares about my health.</p>

        <p>My reps are usually on the same side of things as me.  But I do tell them how I want them to vote on specific things.  Like I wrote my senator about the CARES bailout money.  I told him I didn't want these massive companies that don't pay any taxes STEALING our money.  That bailout money should be tied to the average annual taxes paid by companies to prevent the looting of our tax dollars.  Stupid cares act was the great heist of our lifetime.  If I have to give uncle Sam &rt;25% of my income, why do I get a measly 1200 check and the companies that pay NOTHING get to steal our money.  I actually did the math and it worked out to around $8,900.00 if the entire cares act was individual distributions.  IE despite us paying taxes,  only about 13% of the cares act funds went to real people, meanwhile, ~86% of the funds went to businesses (some of whom didn't pay any taxes at all).  That is really broken and stupid - democrat, republican, doesn't matter, taxpayers got shafted.</p>

        <p>While there’s a place for that discussion, using it in this context is mere sophistry. Your interpretation also lacks the nuance of the idea. It implies science cannot exist with controversy among experts, and that there is no debate about scientific findings at the highest levels. Consensus and paradigms are a product of human social systems, but they don’t dictate truth. Less than a year ago, there was a consensus that masks do fuck all in the community; was there a consensus shift caused by new data? I’d love to see that tremendously compelling data that caused such a rapid scientific revolution, but it doesn’t seem to exist. So far, unfortunately, I’ve only seen rather weak meta-analyses and case series, but maybe I missed something.</p>

<p>I said none of that nor does that idea imply that.  I didn't say there was consensus in any given issue.  I merely said that science is consensus which embodies the idea.  </p>
<p>&rt;Consensus and paradigms are a product of human social systems, but they don’t dictate truth. </p>
<p>No, but they do dictate what normal science is. There isn't truth in anything ever, because science doesn't find truth it just finds the best explanation at the moment.  </p>
<p>&rt;Less than a year ago, there was a consensus that masks do fuck all in the community; </p>
<p>No, actually there wasn't a consensus on that ever.  In fact, no one ever said they "do fuck all"- don't work.</p>
<p>1) Those early messages people were trying to salvage the existing supply of masks for medical providers.  </p>
<p>2) Another indication that this wasn't consensus is who was making and distributing the message it was the CDC and the US DHHS - it wasn't the collective opinions of medical experts globally, it was a bunch of politically controlled government agencies. </p>
<p>3) If you paid attention to other medical experts globally, it's clear that there was never any consensus that masks don't work, in fact, it was immediately attacked by medical experts globally and even domestically.  </p>
<p>4) If you listened to the content of the message, you would know that they never actually said masks didn't work, they said they were not for use by the general public because they 'could be worn improperly' or 'misused' and would therefore be ineffective.  That's like saying the car doesn't work then clarifying that someone could try to drive it while standing in the trunk.  Thry also said explicitly that if people panic bought them they wouldn't be qvailable for medical providers who need them.  It was propaganda, not science.</p>

        <p>The idea of consensus embodying science directly implies that there is no debate among scientists. “The idea” of “normal science” may be that there are prevailing theories, but that’s a pointless statement to make if you accept debate occurs; debate occurs precisely because prevailing theories may be incorrect. All of this to add that you’re using one philosophical framework used to describe science, which, as you pointed out in general, is just an explanation but is not necessarily true.</p>
<p>You dedicate a lot of text attacking my comment under the presumption that I’m referring to the communications about masks in the early days of the pandemic. Newsflash, masks to reduce transmission of respiratory illnesses has been a subject of extensive research before covid. The consensus of those results did not support a benefit in widespread masking. That’s partially why early messaging did not support it. It was only when there were some positive data out of mask-positive countries (in Asia) for covid that there was a consensus shift. Again, this was a social, not scientific shift.</p>

        <p>One thing I’ve noticed is that some schools have been in session for weeks now with regular testing.  Yet we’re only hearing about a handful of schools where positive test results are present ... but even then no one is very sick or hospitalized.  </p>
<p>My point is it does seem as if the mortality rate is much much lower than we were led to believe last spring.   That’s good news.  So why instead of celebrating that fact is everyone so angry and screaming about Covid?  Accosting people in stores for not wearing masks?  Doxxing businesses that don’t enforce masks?   </p>

        <p>College was the worst time of my life, and the bad choices I made there derailed me form the the path to a good life I was already on. It took me 20 years to realize the damage that had been done, and I doubt I'll ever recover fully. I hope to God that there will be other options for my children's continuing education and credentialing that doesn't involve current university system. Its one of the biggest fears I have for the future for her, as many problems we have in the world today. </p>

        <p>eh.. I understand that was your experience. College is not for everyone. Also sounds like you went to college in the 90's? 80's? I'm sure it was much different then. I graduated in 2014. Overall I though College was a good experience. I will say I'm glad I'm not in school now, and I have an established family/career.</p>

        <p>oh for sure, everybody's experience is different. Yeah, the 90's were different, and very true college is not for everyone. I find it odd, though, that most people's experiences were overwhelmingly positive. Not many people finding (or maybe admitting, I was in denial for a long time) that the overall experience might have been net negative. Or maybe its the credentialing that overpowers the rest of the negatives. Or maybe most people had a good time. I don't know.</p>

        <p>Thinking back... I lived off campus, never took part in campus "events" and did feel detached in a sense from campus life. In fact after my first few years I never went anywhere but the kinesiology building (my major). But overall I liked the classes, thought many of the professors were great, and made some lasting friendships with classmates.</p>

        <p>Every subreddit everywhere is full of doomers, except for the skeptic subs (this one, LDS, CVCJ) and possibly conservative subs.  The rest have just become fucking cancer.  Obviously, the default subs are a totally lost cause, and so are local subs.  Any political sub is just an extension of Coronavirus at this point (or is it the other way around?)  I've even run into assholes bleating about "staying safe" in car subs, kayaking/paddling subs, music/musician subs, and a million others.  This whole website is like half CCP shills and half pessimistic antisocial shut-in losers who are loving that they finally get to have their day in the sun.</p>

        <p>I would just like to remind everyone that reddit is nowhere near representative of real life. It’s full of losers who have no way of finding joy in their lives other than sabotage the people actually going out and having fun out of spite.</p>

        <p>I got doxxed for being even the slightest bit lockdown skeptical back in May. Somehow my name and email address got out (I think someone went through my posts and found a project I was working on a year ago I had also posted to Hackaday and Github) then shared it with some discord and I got almost 100 nastygrams in a day on Discord, email and Reddit. Locked my Facebook before they could get on there too.</p>
