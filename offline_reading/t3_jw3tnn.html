        <p>Exponential growth. Also, people here were over this months ago, and mostly began to live their lives as normal. Additionally, we had an early cold snap and snowstorm that forced everyone inside. We have a high obesity rate and rate of adults with pre existing conditions. While people could stand to be a bit more cautious about disease transmission, those I see who are the most resistant to the precautions are said obese/at risk population.</p>

        <p>The Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, and other rural states were the very last ones to get a first wave, starting in September about 6 months after western Europe and the NE United States.</p>
<p>Testing has increased 30-50x in this time period, meaning many, many more people are getting a covid diagnosis. We know that testing has inherent flaws and that many deaths can now be labeled as covid while not being the primary cause.</p>
<p>The combination of late first wave + massively increased testing + overlabeling covid deaths = high mortality rate. A better way to determine their overall covid count is to look at excess mortality, which seems to spike during the first wave (when there is an actual pandemic).</p>
<p>Both Dakotas have the highest cases recorded per million amongst any US State or country. They are approaching 10% tested positive. Yes, that's right - by next month 10% of the entire population will have a recorded positive covid test in each of the Dakotas.</p>

        <p>Actually, North Dakota was one of the first states to have cases, unique to the 4 you mentioned above. While I’m not in any way for this new normal, things are bad here-perhaps a precursor of what’s to come in the rest of the country, idk.</p>

        <p>Initial cases is not a wave. They had 12,000 cases until September 1, and 52,000 since. They are in the middle of their first wave and should be heading down (in terms of daily cases) in the next 1-2 weeks.</p>

        <p>Ok. Our primary problem and the reason our death count is high is that COVID has been ravaging nursing homes in all parts of the state, as it does. As far as the rate coming down in the next weeks, I hope it does, but I don’t see that happening here until next year because of the holidays. I hope I’m wrong</p>

        <p>Looks like a whole bunch of grass</p>
<p>Edit: From the statistics in the article, 36 people could die from covid on average in these two states. LOCK IT ALL DOWN</p>

        <p>Certain people here have been begging for lockdowns for months, but we’re lucky that our governor has held out. Some may say that’s the reason for the situation we’re in now. I say that’s the reason our rates of increase of other problems have remained low. No one in NoDak wants to be unemployed. “WeLl It’S bEttEr tHAn DeAd!” is the inevitable reply. Most of us here are doing just fine. Life is almost totally normal, and that’s the best we can ask for during all this.</p>
