    <strong>I can’t do this anymore. I’ve had enough.</strong>
    <p><p>(Sorry this is a long rant and no one will probably read  but I need to get all of this out somewhere before I explode)</p>
<p>My country just announced that the lockdown will be extended for another month. They have absolutely no idea what they are doing. </p>
<p>I think I’m becoming depressed. </p>
<p>I literally haven’t showered in 8 days (sorry for the gross visual)</p>
<p>I haven’t seen my parents in a year. I haven’t hugged anyone in a year. </p>
<p>My friends...well they showed their true colours in 2020 and now I have no friends. I wonder how I’ll ever find good friends or heck even boyfriend after this all. people are paranoid, dating or meeting new people is not allowed and when I do start meeting new people will they be crazy lockdown freaks who sanitise their hands every 20 minutes and listen to every word the government says?</p>
<p>I’m 25 and the last years of my 20’s are going to be ruined because god knows how long this shit will go on for. Best years of my life just gone. The years I should be travelling and falling in love and making friends and discovering who I am. </p>
<p>I’ve never felt so hopeless in my entire life. I’ve sat watching movies back to back the last three months, just waiting for the 1st of March to come around because that’s when they said we’d be out of lockdown. I’ve been in lockdown for nearly a year. </p>
<p>My cousin who is 25 already had mental health problems before all of this and in November he had to be put into a mental hospital because that’s how bad things got for him. I’m afraid if he gets out and lockdown is still happening he’ll kill himself. My parents friend has cancer and hasn’t been able to get treatment, her appointments keep being pushed back. </p>
<p>I lost my job 9 months ago and have been applying to hundreds and no luck at all. Now I’m living on benefits and don’t even care at this point, the benefits office call me every month to see if I have found a job and I just say no. I’ve been looking and applying for literally 8 months and no one has responded or there are no jobs at all. So now I don’t even care. I also lost a amazing opportunity in Hawaii that I’ll probably never get again. </p>
<p>Yesterday I was out walking on the street for fresh air and some guy comes up to me so aggressively and says you need to be wearing a mask. People barley look you in the eyes and act as if you are an infected monster. I haven’t seen anyone smile in what feels like years. Now the supermarket where I am won’t allow you in unless you sanitise your hands and then wear gloves. People I used to be friends with said they love lockdown and never want it to end, they just sit watching Netflix all day. </p>
<p>Don’t even get me started on the waste this pandemic has cause, now there are more plastic face masks in the ocean than there are jelly fish. </p>
<p>I’m starting to actually feel numb, I can’t even cry anymore like I’ve cried that much I’m all out of tears, just feel so numb. movies, music everything no longer excites me. Just sitting here staring out the window at the cold and the rain feeling like I’m actually dead inside.</p>
<p>What’s even more crazy is celebrities just seem to get a free pass to do anything they want and go wherever they want. I’m seeing countless celebs on vacation and I’m just sitting here isolated and sad while all these rich people are living it up on vacation. Movies and tv shows are allowed to shoot but I can’t get a simple haircut. </p>
<p>I can’t do this anymore, I’ve had enough. I really am starting to become extremely angry, I’m gonna go travel to see my parents who live 5 hours away. Im gonna do whatever I like. I don’t give a fuck anymore. I’m doing what I want. I’ve had enough. I don’t care if people look at me crazy. Tomorrow I’m getting up and going where I want, travelling to see my parents and I’m not gonna wear a mask in the shop either. Fuck it.</p></p>

        <p>I don't know, I think this comment and the one above it are bullshit. There are plenty of things people can do to help others right now. Just listening to someone talk, affirming how they feel in the midst of these unprecedented times, taking a phone call from them and hearing them out and letting them vent, ordering some take out and coming over to hang out for a while, playing a game online to help cheer someone up ... there are tons of things people can do to help. Jesus Christ, I hope you're not treating your own loved ones and people you know who are lonely in real life the same way you're treating this kid. Get off your ass and go do something to help someone you lazy, nihilistic fucks.</p>

        <p>You're creating a straw man, assuming it's one or the other. I can and do look after people, thank you very much, but that doesn't preclude me from recognizing that no one has a more vested interest in taking care of me and mine than me.</p>

        <p>Bullshit. I didn't assume anything and there's no "strawman". Look at your exact words:</p>
<p>&rt;And no one has any interest in helping you but you.</p>
<p>That's what you choose to say to someone that's borderline suicidal? You're a piece of shit. "<strong>NO ONE</strong> has <strong>ANY</strong> interest in helping you. Read those words out loud and tell me if that sounds like the thing to tell someone in the moment they're most hopeless? And then you go on to be a hypocrite by claiming that you help other people. So those people have someone who's interested in helping them, but OP doesn't? I mean just listen to yourself. </p>
<p>You need to adjust how you respond to people having a mental health crisis, or better yet, just shut your fucking mouth and don't say anything all.</p>

        <p>Would it kill you to show a little empathy towards someone who is understandably having a mental health breakdown during these unprecedented times? For the record, I'm on your side and I agree that we need to fight back, but is this really the right time and place to insert that agenda?</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, people are having serious mental health problems right now. "StOp ObEyInG!!!" doesn't bring this persons friends back. It doesn't lift the requirement to wear a mask without being removed from a store by police or being filmed and shamed all over social media. It doesn't bring people's jobs back. It doesn't stop people's paranoid families from cancelling holidays. It doesn't stop the media from spreading lies and a bullshit Presidential administration from issuing more mandates. It doesn't stop employers who lean towards mandating vaccines. It doesn't open public schools. It doesn't restore normalcy that was lost over the past year. You get the point?  </p>
<p>When someone comes to you with a mental health breakdown, you affirm how they feel because they are human beings and they SHOULD feel that way. It's totally normal to have a breakdown considering the circumstances. After you've allowed them to vent, affirmed how they feel, and built them up a bit to recover some strength, then, and only then, do you start encouraging them to fight back. Your post was lazy and agenda driven and ill-timed.</p>

        <p>Go outside. Any time someone tells you to wear a mask double down and spend more time outside.  I actually do this on reddit.  Anyone some slams one of my comments I make the same or similar comment at least three times more.  Fuck them.  Spending time outside, cleaning, personal hygiene, exercising are always wins long term.</p>

        <p>You know that people generally don’t care if you’re outside without a mask right? It’s really just for when you’re around a large group of people or inside a privately owned business. </p>
<p>You can go outside. You can get in a car and drive as far as you want and nobody will stop you at a checkpoint. The whole point is that you just take precautions when you are in a group of people. That’s it.</p>

        <p>&rt; I wonder how I’ll ever find good friends or heck even boyfriend after this all. people are paranoid, dating or meeting new people is not allowed and when I do start meeting new people will they be crazy lockdown freaks who sanitise their hands every 20 minutes and listen to every word the government says?</p>
<p>Maybe shoot your shot in this group or look into other groups were people don't agree with the new normal, I am sure you will find someone fun.</p>

        <p>&rt; They have absolutely no idea what they are doing.</p>
<p>Don't be fooled by the feigned ignorance of political front men/women. They know that they are lying to, and stealing from, their citizens. However, ultimately, they are not the ones pulling the strings, and the trick that they get people to fall for, over and over again, is that they <em>are</em>.</p>
<p>&rt; I wonder how I’ll ever find good friends or heck even boyfriend after this all.</p>
<p>It will be difficult. You'll have to sift through a lot of crappy people before you find someone you really click with. For me, at least, it was like this long before Covid happened. There are ways to speed this process along, though. For example, anyone wearing a mask in their Tinder pics I immediately discard. I also made my views on Covid crystal clear in my bio.</p>
<p>&rt; The years I should be travelling and falling in love and making friends and discovering who I am.</p>
<p>I'm in my early 30s, and I'm still in this mindset, even now. I know exactly how it feels to be cheated out of living the rest of your life. I know exactly how it feels to do the right thing for years on end and still have the rug pulled out from underneath you. This doesn't have to end, though — not for you, not for me, not for anyone — and certainly not because the government said so. You'll have to get creative, though.</p>
<p>&rt; I also lost a amazing opportunity in Hawaii that I’ll probably never get again.</p>
<p>I'm sure most of us have fallen victim to broken promises like that. The labour union that I'm still trying to join gave me some hopeful lip service after my initial training was completed. This was all pre-Covid, of course, and you can guess how that turned out. That being said, never is a long time, and nobody can say for sure what the next few years will look like.</p>
<p>&rt; I’m seeing countless celebs on vacation and I’m just sitting here isolated and sad while all these rich people are living it up on vacation.</p>
<p>Rules for thee, but not for me. The rich live on essentially a different planet than we do in regards to the freedoms that they enjoy. Keep in mind, though, that while they may have an abundance of money, power and fame, their integrity and morality are all but nonexistent. To me, living a life like that is a fate worse than death.</p>
<p>&rt; Tomorrow I’m getting up and going where I want, travelling to see my parents and I’m not gonna wear a mask in the shop either. Fuck it.</p>
<p>And that, right there, is how this all ends. We get a significant minority of people, at the very least, to sack up and say no. TPTB are killing us slowly, like the proverbial frog in the boiling water. Do we live on our knees, or die on our feet? For me, the answer is obvious.</p>
<p>I think I speak for everyone here when I say that I'm proud of you for turning your anger into courage, something which is sorely lacking among the general public.</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>

        <p>A great way to get out is to volunteer to clean up trails in parks, national parks etc. You would be outside in nature, 6 feet apart and no mask, other humans and possibly future dates. Hang in there, we are all struggling right now.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it's time to be creative or to learn a new skill.
Paint a masterpiece or just make a mess, at least you have expressed yourself. Watching films etc is a way to unwind but very prosaic. I know it's not the same but you can video call or chat to your family everyday. Give yourself a hug.</p>
<p>I refused to wear a mask at first. I bought an exemption card from the Internet. Now I wear a mask because it easier to play along than absorb all of the negativity.</p>
<p>Pick yourself up and have a shower. Exercise, mediate, and start doing yoga. This is a crappy time for everbody but don't waste what freedom you still have.</p>

        <p>I feel for you so much. It feels like people trivialize the mental impact that forced isolation causes. It feels like a denial of human nature to get fresh air, to get sunlight, and to move freely. </p>
<p>I remember prior seeing the news pump out so many articles of "is staying inside killing you???" and going on and on about how X study said 24 hours indoors will cause all these problems and how you better be scared etc etc. </p>
<p>But this is over a year. And now it's doomsday article after doomsday article of how unless you lock yourself in a box for years to come you're in danger and that this is the new standard. The new normal. Forget allll else you heard. They always assume you have a great big house to move around in, too. </p>
<p>Prior to this, I was an outdoors 24/7 person. I'm also nearing the end of my young adult years, and it feels like I'm expected to sit and wait for the entire rest of them as they move the goal post further and further away. </p>
<p>I'm also sick to death of it and about to give up.</p>

        <p>So glad you are going to visit your parents, I relate to all of this but I am older than you and feel like I have less years left and I am wasting time. I am beginning to think we will be looking back on this and feeling some sort of weird pride eventually that we realized the truth. Take a nice fragrant shower and put on some fresh clothing and have some tea. You will come through this and you will rebuild. Go to your parents and get some hugs and face to face time ❤️❤️❤️❤️</p>

        <p>This sucks so much. I feel for you, I really do.
I have been so negative lately. Going around saying, "this is hell on earth. Change my mind" until a friend said "you make your own hell. Spread joy and look for little things that make you happy."</p>
<p>You going to visit your parents, you are doing what makes you happy. Good for you. I hope you find peace soon.  Drive safe. 💗</p>
