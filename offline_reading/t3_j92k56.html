        <p>Indeed. They didn't even want to be trend-setters with wearing a mask when sick, as that example laid out. If they were so concerned about making it the norm, they'd have started it way before.</p>
<p>Just like our movement: rebellion against lockdown measures begins with the individual setting the trend</p>

        <p>I don't get it either. I don't understand the pro mask thing. When I was a teenager I was also an edgy teen. I had my own version of the "emo phase", had low self-esteem and didn't like my own looks. I had the typical teenage problems. Did I want to cover up my face? Hell no. Seeing faces are naturally. I will never come up with such impractical idea. Now I've gone through the teen phase and the self-esteem issues are over. Still don't get the mask thing.</p>

<p>I think if teachers wears masks, I would still be honest about it - that I can't hear what they're saying when wearing them. Then they had to write down everything they wanted to tell me. :)</p>

And the bacterial infections will start to rise and so will fungal infections. Wait until they are all coughing their last and going, "but at least it wasn't the Covid that got me!" like the good little sheep that they are.</p>

        <p>My coworker’s husband is a manager in a grocery store so he has had to wear a mask 5 days a week, probably an average of 12 hrs a day, and he says he can feel phlegm or god knows what building up in his lungs as a result. These asshats are creating health issues for lower class/retail workers who are basically their slaves, delivering their groceries and keeping the “essential” businesses running.</p>

        <p>The only group of people that I have any admiration for in this artificially engineered crisis are retail workers. They keep working even though they get paid shit, are treated worse, and have been told by society at large that they were completely expendable right from the start. If I worked in retail, I'd have burned the fucking store that employed me down by now. They are the only "heroes" that I've seen in 9 months. </p>
<p>But once they'd established how little society cared about retail workers, it was pretty easy to force them to be muzzled, because if they die from this? We've already established that society doesn't care.</p>

<p>These people have been gaslit by being told they are 'essential workers', and in my country, many got a temporary increase in pay because they are WoRkInG oN tHe FrOnT liNeS, as though they were fighting in WW2. 🙄 As you said, this is an artificially engineered crisis, so it's not as though their job has any additional risk.</p>
<p>The only risk that's been added is having to wear masks, which their employer should not be requiring.</p>

<p>Surgical masks are one time use, 4 hours in a clean pressurized room (think operating room) and are only good for 30 minutes in regular environments before you should dispose of them properly.</p>

        <p>The paper and fibers that are used to make all types of single use n95 and surgical masks are dangerous if inhaled. Usually this is not an issue because nobody continues to wear a soiled mask and they don't break down right away. N95 and KN95 makes no difference they both use fibers that if inhaled can be very damaging to the lungs.</p>
<p>Think like asbestos, which is a fiber, and when inhaled causes damage to the lungs. Idk about the Chinese dye and if that's true or not. The biggest take away should be never reuse these types of masks.</p>

<p>Do the people in this thread also understand there are entire cities that wear masks frequently and have for years/decades? About large portions of SEA just don’t exist. My friend who taught in Korea finds all these comments about masks hilarious lol.</p>

        <p>You are talking complete bollocks, I'm afraid. I have lived in Southeast Asia for 10 years now and not a single "large portion" of this region wears masks even semi-regularly. In fact, even in Chiang Mai with the worst pollution during the burning season - no one has ever worn a mask. Stop with the fantasies.</p>

        <p>This is a preprint but from September 2020:</p>
<p>""Surgical personnel are trained to never touch any part of a mask, except the loops and the nose bridge.  Otherwise, the mask is considered useless and is to be replaced.  Surgical personnel are strictly trained not to touch their masks otherwise.  However, the general public may be seen touching various parts of their masks.  Even the masks just removed from manufacturer packaging have been shown in the above photos to contain particulate and fiber that would not be optimal to inhale.  </p>
<p>Both cotton and polymer clothing have been well-tolerated without pathology when covering any other part of the body, except over the only entry points/gateway to the respiratory system.  Inhalation risks, such as the constant ventilation of the respiratory process, increased by the greater effort to attempt to fulfill bodily oxygen needs, with mostly and closely covered orifices are of great concern for those who would want to protect pulmonary health, without inhalation of unwanted particulate.  When partial airway obstruction, i.e. masking, is added, deeper and more forceful breathing occurs.  When this phenomenon is combined with the particles found herein on microscopic examination of the face side of newly unpackaged, never worn masks, there can arise the risk of a dangerous level of foreign material entering lung tissue. Furthermore, worn masks can only either lose these particles to lodge in the lungs of the wearer, or they would accumulate during use, to the burden (both biological and debris) of non-mask material carried on the inside of the mask.  </p>
<p>Further concerns of macrophage response and other immune and inflammatory and fibroblast response to such inhaled particles specifically from facemasks should be the subject of more research.</p>
<p>If widespread masking continues, then the potential for inhaling mask fibers and environmental and biological debris continues on a daily basis for hundreds of millions of people.  This should be alarming for physicians and epidemiologists knowledgeable in occupational hazards."</p>

        <p>I've told my teachers in college I can't understand what they're saying with a mask on. After filing several complaints they only wanted to use clear mask 50% of the times, so I still have to deal with black masks 50% of the times. I didn't pay (time) going to a college not willingly to accommodate to their students. It's especially upsetting considering several of these teachers have background from special ed and have worked with people needing more accommodation than the average. The only thing I've asked about is a good communication and that they wears a clear mask 100% of the times instead of a black one. I know they don't want granny dead, but they could use a clear mask. I never told them to take it off. Clear or black, does it really matter for them? Sometimes it seems like they're trying to make a statement.</p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Bergeron</p>
<p>&rt;"Harrison Bergeron" is a dystopian science-fiction short story by American writer Kurt Vonnegut, first published in October 1961. Originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, the story was republished in the author's Welcome to the Monkey House collection in 1968. The story received the 2019 Hall of Fame Award from the Libertarian Futurist Society. </p>
<p>&rt;In the year 2081, the 211th, 212th, and 213th amendments to the Constitution dictate that all Americans are fully equal and not allowed to be smarter, better-looking, or more physically able than anyone else. The Handicapper General's agents enforce the equality laws, forcing citizens to wear "handicaps": masks for those who are too beautiful, loud radios that disrupt thoughts inside the ears of intelligent people, and heavy weights for the strong or athletic.</p>

        <p>We should shame people for wearing masks, especially when the mandates are lifted. It’s not fucking normal and most people don’t care or just don’t know about the negative effects.</p>

        <p>Let them, but if mandates stick around post-pandemic, it’s gonna be a real legal mud sling fest. I can see it from a mile away, lawsuits after lawsuits from normal people (like it or not, many people I know plan to stop complying after vaccination) that demand mandates be lifted.</p>

        <p>Look at Sweden. I hope all of our old people just go ahead and die and get it over with like what happened in Sweden in their nursing homes. 14000 elderly died in nursing homes there over the course of a month in April and I hope that happens here and we can just cull the herd and be done with it.
