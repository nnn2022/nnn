        <p>One of my favorite copypastas:</p>
<p>Do you have a source on that?</p>
<p>Source?</p>
<p>A source. I need a source.</p>
<p>Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.</p>
<p>No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.</p>
<p>You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Do you have a degree in that field?</p>
<p>A college degree? In that field?</p>
<p>Then your arguments are invalid.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.</p>
<p>Correlation does not equal causation.</p>
<p>CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.</p>
<p>You still haven't provided me a valid source yet.</p>
<p>Nope, still haven't.</p>
<p>I just looked through all 308 pages of your user history, figures I'm debating a glormpf supporter. A moron.</p>

        <p>This is fair. What this suggests to me is that the best advice for avoiding transmission is to avoid unnecessary contact. When that isn't possible, the best method of mitigating exposure is maintaining distance and proper sanitation measures (don't stick unwashed fingers in your eyes or nose, wash your hands thoroughly and frequently and/or use hand sanitizer). When maintaining distance is impossible (and there should be specific emphasis on that clause), masks can be used to lower the probability of transmission (albeit perhaps not by much, depending on type of mask and adherence to mask protocol) by reducing (not eliminating) droplet transmission distance and penetration. Would you consider that a fair assessment?</p>
<p>The trouble, as I see it, is that today's society has no tolerance for nuance. They want a bottom-line message that they can put on a bumper sticker or copy into a standard tweet that removes all shades of gray from a simple black-and-white mental image. They can't tolerate the idea of having to do the mental arithmetic necessary to gauge risk. It's not just in mask debates, it's in every corner of political discussion - are all liberal ideas tantamount to Stalinist communism? Are all conservative ideas tantamount to Neo-Nazi fascism? If course not, but that's the message that's broadcast to us all day, every day. No nuance is permitted.</p>
<p>So it is with science. Actual science is almost always nuanced and rarely if ever considered "settled" - and that's how it should be. How it MUST be. But the scientists have noticed that no one listens to nuance, and no one trusts any of them as long as one of them disagrees. So they play into the no-nuance system of sound bites: "MASKS SAVE LIVES!" "MASKS PREVENT TRANSMISSION!" Because using masks is arguably better, as long as enough people do it correctly, than not using anything at all. But the nuance gets lost. And yes, some scientists are going to parlay the crisis into their own popularity and celebrity. Scientists are humans (well, most of them), too, and there is an allure to being interviewed and printed and talked about and being trusted, especially in a society that trusts real science less and less with each passing year. If you don't trust Anthony Fauci, don't listen to him. But do read the science, and try to read all of it, not just the stuff that bolsters your own perspective. That's the reason I'm on this reddit in the first place: I don't share your general disdain for masks, or a general horror at the idea of a "new normal," but if I'm ever going to be intellectually honest, I have to be willing to listen to intelligent people who disagree with me. A paraphrased quote from Sports Night: "If you're dumb, surround yourself with smart people, and if you're smart, surround yourself with smart people who disagree with you."</p>
<p>Sorry for the screed. Back to lurking!</p>

        <p>Your reply was awesome. I really liked how you worded the centrist principles "are all liberal ideas tantamount to Stalinism?"</p>
<p>I'm not formally educated past high school, but I've learned through the years that my mind is a mind of science. Experiment and observe, repeat. Question everything that feels questionable. Hell, it's called different things, but from WWZ the "eleventh man" is a super cool practice and scientific principle at its core. If all the best minds, who would disagree on plenty else, are in agreeance on something, then it's scientific duty to force one of those minds to consider the polar opposite of what they perceive as true.</p>
<p>It doesnt happen much anymore, now that I'm an adult with tons of info and reasoning experience behind me, but I used to f*cking hate when someone with a bachelors degree in biology or something would roll their eyes at me for even CONSIDERING unconventional theories. Not my fault their minds are clogged and incapable of the complex thoughts that true figures of science had.</p>
<p>When blind people say stuff about clearly politicized issues like climate change or masks, even if you agree with them in principle, remind them that 99% of scientists once agreed the world was flat 🙄</p>

        <p>Per your source: 
The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets.
Respiratory droplets are multiple microns in size. 
Cloth masks filtered up to 30% of a range of particles as small as 0.02 microns and at the largest particle size tested didn't exceed even 1 micron.</p>
<p>Or from the WHO guidance on cloth masks cited by your source: "There is no current evidence to make a recommendation for or against their use in this setting."</p>
<p>Or the cited MacIntyre et al study in BJM, which was published years before COVID19 was even a thing, in which they themselves point out that they lacked a "no mask" group to compare the efficacy of cloth masks. </p>
<p>I'd go on, but I hate typing this much on a phone</p>
<p>In short, you might want to find better sources for the point you're trying to make.  What you cited basically just says that masks may help, but the work hasn't been done to show one way or the other.</p>

        <p>noooooooooooooo its called are you trying to bait me into a never ending debate of "sources"  Those sources also did a lot of mask type testing...came up with some numbers too.... HmmMmM</p>
<p>Also if you believe the mask... do you believe then that the CDC and "experts" lied to your face for 3 months so the public didn't buy up the mask supply?</p>
<p>CDC: masks don't work</p>
<p>CDC: only if you are sick</p>
<p>CDC: only n95 work</p>
<p>CDC: everyone where a mask, anything works as a mask wrap a towel around your face......</p>
<p>oh wait it took them TIME TO FIGURE THINGS OUT... it took the CDC and the "EXPERTS" 6 months to figure out wrapping a ANYTHING around your face prevents the virus.</p>

        <p>Oh you mean like the numbers I explicitly discussed in literally my first comment?  From the papers that I've not said anything critical about?  Or the MacIntyre paper that made no mention of the particle sizes?  Have you even read your sources?  Because you've certainly failed to reference anything specific in them, other than that they contain "numbers"</p>
<p>Also when did I say I thought masks worked?  Im quite doubtful of their efficacy in a large-scale public health context.  But when you make pompous assertions about papers you clearly haven't actually read and then make up vague conspiracies, you lower the credibility of everyone who is doubtful about the efficacy of masks.</p>

        <p>It's so frustrating. I'm really good at using my brain to form logical connections between things, and I'm really good at statistics (I'm an actuary), but none of that matters to these people unless you can provide them with a "reliable source." But "reliable sources" to them are just sources they agree with. These people are such a waste of time.</p>

        <p>and once you post a link to your source, it doesn't matter how legit it is. They'll look at it for 10 seconds and completely dismiss it because the journal is somehow not "credible" or the study doesn't use a sample size of 5000000 people</p>

        <p>This is why I rarely, if ever, offer sources upon request. I consider this a demand for me to do your homework/let you cheat on the test. No dude, you’re such a genius researcher, you find it yourself. I’m not going through the trouble of finding this source again (in about five minutes, but still inconvenient and derails the discussion) only for you to skim it, dismiss the website itself or launch your Denialist script. </p>
<p>When you attend an assembly or convention or symposium, do you see anyone halting the discussion to double-check a source? No. You are expected to be fully informed on the subject that you “gracefully” inserted yourself into. If you’re not fully informed, you conduct further research and study and you are blamed for being unprepared.</p>
<p>I understand that some people want a shortcut to information but you’re never going to learn how to conduct independent research if you expect everyone to hold your hand through it. It’s better for all of us imo if the person simply looks it up on their own volition. </p>
<p>The only exceptions being a particular obscure source, of course, but most are not obscure. I remember mentioning the FBI’s tactical briefing on Chinese espionage and being asked for a source. I found the YouTube video of the briefing by simply typing in “FBI briefing China.” If you’re really struggling to find a source like that, maybe you could use the practice.</p>

<p>It suggests the ban on the hydration claim was rooted not so much in the idea that officials concluded water doesn't hydrate, but in the semantics of the claim applied for. Which is still the hallmark of a beautifully Byzantine bureaucracy: semantics before intelligence! That's the thing about most stories of this type: the journalists see the bottom line, the readers see the bottom line, but the bureaucrats? The bureaucrats are paid by the minutiae. There hasn't been a bottom line invented yet that a good bureaucrat couldn't ignore.</p>
