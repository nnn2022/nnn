    <strong>only 3 friends out of 200 or so on FB are not getting the vaxx.</strong>
    <p><p>I know some of you claim most people aren't lining up but around here they are, and I feel afraid. This may sound horrible but I don't like some of my friends and acquaintances as much anymore. Is that terrible to have feelings change about people? For now I am keeping quiet, and trying not to be negative towards people for personal medical decisions, but there's part of me inside who thinks some of these people would hand unvaccinated me over to the camp pretty quick. A few had understanding and empathy for my medical issues, but they were the exception and more long distant friends. </p>
<p>I feel like my life is destroyed and I will never be able to take part in activities again, two clubs are shutting out the nonvaccinated. I am invalidated many places I turn even by so called "friends", the very few I warned. I know I probably have already lost a few people, the few I opened my mouth too as I am keeping it shut with the majority.  I have decided to keep things secret from the majority, I am posting far less on Facebook and may depart from there except showing art projects and using some messenger [am deaf] </p>
<p>I don't feel safe among local people. There's the whole spike protein thing, but then there's the expectation you are vaccinated at any events. </p>
<p>Some are writing scary things about vaccines. I do not know any people who question the system here. I always kind of wondered about this town and wanted to leave years ago because there were so few independent thinkers here. [it is more affluent outside of a ghetto area, I'm not and I guess for people who the system works for, they question it less]</p>
<p>I feel like I am in a living hell. I feel like things are going only going to get worse. My isolation is so extreme, outside of marriage, I don't think it could be any worse for a person. I am measuring words like teaspoons like June on Handmaids Tale afraid of all these  people around me.[well contact is only via Zoom and online]</p>
<p>I am shocked at the numbers who have signed up. I am definitely am an isolated outliner around here and in life.</p></p>

        <p>I think that you have to refrain from judging people who are getting the vax if you don't want to be judged for not getting the vax.  I personally know more people who have gotten it than not, but when I look at data regarding who has been vaccinated, it's generally less than half of the population and demand is drying up.  I see articles weekly about how mass vaccination sites are getting shut down because no one is going.</p>

        <p>I'm keeping my mouth shut. I know some have more fear, more contact with the public. It will be better to keep negative thoughts to myself. My social life is destroyed anyhow and disatisfactory at this point in time. I find myself caring less and less. I can't be "me" around the majority of these people and with no authenticity, the connections are not that strong. Everytime I find a community or any connection it is destroyed anyhow.</p>
<p>I have been judged already by the few I opened mouth too in choosing not to get it. I am glad where you are at it is less than half the population and the vaccine sites are being shut down.</p>

        <p>Yeah I am suppressing my feelings of anger on purpose, thinking I should not blame them for their gullibility. The fact remains I cannot talk to them openly anyhow. I am keeping things superficial on purpose. I got majorly burned with the few I opened up to and tried to warn because I care about them [closer friends]</p>

        <p>I am friends with a husband and wife couple that I really liked. She got the vaccine while pregnant (posts constantly about how she is giving her baby antibodies) and any picture of their 2 year old not taken in their house, she has a mask on that is up to her eyes, like idk how this poor kid can see. My feelings about them have really changed over the last year.</p>

        <p>People in the past never would have taken an experimental vaccine with a baby. I feel sorry for that baby, bet their future is already impacted. I feel bad for the child too, all the masking is going to have huge psychological and other effects. Yes this is some of what is happening to me with friends and acquaintances. My feelings have changed about them. I am keeping it to myself, but I do not feel the same about some of them.</p>

        <p>This may sound horrible but if they do get really bad problems rather have it happen sooner then later, the more this drags out the more hell it will bring. Of course some get sick the very first day or week.</p>

        <p>Yeah I have to focus on myself. The social life or what there was of one got destroyed. I am tired of fake people and weary beyond belief, some were nice and probably scared themselves but I don't know if I live in a scary town or if everywhere has changed like this in last 10 years or so. I'm not going to try to help anymore, just got shot down. I believe they will die, so that inside pressure was hard.  I agree about being brave. I am not the type to let anyone pressure me. I've faced serious health problems and already crossed that rubicon, most don't realize what they are gambling with.</p>

        <p>Very sorry that this is going so tough in your area.  As we know, many of the liberal persuasion have a super conformist streak that has been on open display, like they couldn't even figure out how to legitimately and peaceably treat mask usage (as a voluntary temporary option) or schools.  The rate of injections will decline for one thing, and you will see less celebration as more evidence of negative reactions is confirmed.  It is horrid that they feel justified in circling their wagons to exclude their friend and colleague, but that is the sort of narcissistic dogmatism that our societal rot feeds upon.  You must have faith in the difficult truth and continue to calmly point out the flaws in perception and judgment you've discovered during this period if you do find anyone more receptive.  If your husband and you can consider relocation again hopefully you can build other ties there.  </p>
<p>It sure has been strange to see how illogical people really have become but we can only maintain clarity and point out what conclusions are within our understanding.  The feeling of isolation, can you find new places to spend time that give a slight alleviation?<br>
Many have also felt that impending doom, it's difficult to grapple with, but we pledge before heaven and earth that many sceptical-minded, humane souls make it to the other side of this evil and that the light shall not vanish another century.</p>
<p>They should stop bothering about the shots soon if they don't want endless boostrs and ridiculous percentages of illness from that. ❤Stay strong❤</p>

        <p>Yes this area is not good. Liberals have lost it. I say that as a leftist but I am not supporting where they are going and I am done. There seems to be an extreme proving how obedient and conformist they are thing going with the majority of them. It is now virtue signaling to be a good little drone. I can tell the vaccinated around here are already realizing it's not a magic pancea, and they are still afraid to meet indoors with each other. </p>
<p>I also wonder if all the piling up illness and expected boosters will also take a toll, as even many of the true believers who got the vaxx were complaining on Facebook about being so sick, some for days, and I knew the two who got tingling in their limbs.</p>
<p>Oddly I think some are so brainwashed, they won't even criticize the vaccine even after terrible health problems or having severe flu like symptoms for days. I like when I see those articles that many have refused to sign up for the second shot, probably because they got so sick.</p>
<p>Yes the wagons are circling, they don't want anything to do with you if you go against the grain. I am keeping it more private this is a social minefield. I believe narcissism plays into this and even social media, where one no longer lives life but shows one life off like a product. I do have a few friends who agree with me where I can talk to them, but sadly I had to give up with the rest, the few attempts I made with gentle facts went very badly.</p>
<p>I have to be true to myself and think of my own survival and husband's too. I do think of relocating but husband is not keen on this. There are a lot of medical resources for us here. Maybe I can find other people who are more in aggreement. I am going out a bit more and trying to live life I can doing stuff with husband.</p>
<p>With people and all this I think difficulties being on the autistic spectrum is impacting things. I have to accept things probably will never be normal for me. I can't follow these people down into a totalitarian abyss, and won't sell out when my life and freedom is at stake. </p>
<p>I think they don't know what they have signed on to. I do expect immense medical effects from the shots to become realities. Some pay the price with earlier blood clots and other bad problems but I think more horrible health stuff is coming for them. I certainly don't want anyone to suffer.  The endless boosters and more will build up spike proteins and toxins in their body. I can't see human bodies taking that forever without people waking up.</p>
<p>Thanks for your kind post.</p>

        <p>Absolutely and thanks for posting more of your perspective.  Certainly many in cities have related dilemmas as to their friend pool and yeah we see maskers even up here nearer to the woods.  I think your husband will see eventually that the syndrome isn't necessarily just floating away and you two can put your feelers out quietly to find more critical thinkers.  It will be an adjustment no matter which sequence of societal catastrophes they manage to unleash next!😂</p>

        <p>I feel you on this!  I have someone on FB (not even a friend - a person I played sports with years ago) who actually polled his friends - asking who was taking the vaccine and who wasn't.  those that spoke up that they weren't (with good reasons) - he then argued against them and accused them of wanting to kill off their friends/family.  I sat quietly and just watched it all, but sure let me know who he really is!</p>

        <p>I've tried making friends here, it's been very hard. I had the groups to try to make real life ones, I had a lot of casual people. Some of them were nice but being disabled and on the spectrum, it makes it hard. Almost all friends are long distance. This place really has been impossible to make friends in. I need a place where people aren't so fake and focused on status. This isn't Minnesota but think of a place that is Minnesota Nice to the hilt.</p>

        <p>How is my path detached from reality and be specific. Your reality is bullshit. Yeah go take the poison shot and wear your mask, I am noticing the vaccinations aren't opening things up because they don't work and don't stop transmission.</p>
<p>Oh I would also know how I am "harming" people. I am being harmed by this bullshit. I have serious health problems, and society is putting pressure on me to get a vaccine that has a very high chance of out and out killing me. So am I tinfoil hat to just want to stay alive? </p>
<p>Yeah turn me into a monster you Nazi, a disabled woman whose not around anyone but her own husband and wears the masks due to her higher risk.  That's what you gotta do, just invalidate and discredit. Society is the cult with their phony "vaccines" that don't work and other BS. Go be a happy slave in the "new normal".</p>
<p>Anyhow as for the tin foil crap, when the so called "conspiracy" people predict things that end up happening it's no longer a conspiracy.</p>

        <p>"Poison shot" would be a good example of a detachment from reality. The vaccines have been proven to work to prevent hospitalisations and reduce transmissions immensely. It doesn't matter if you deny this, it's a fact. There were also people who thought AIDS was made up. You're todays equivalent.</p>
<p>You're harming people by spreading your bullshit. If you legitimately can't be vaccinated due to medical reasons that doctors confirm this, okay. Then you should be happy that so many other people are getting it though, because herd immunity will be needed to open up.</p>
<p>I'll think about you when I'm partying, knowing that I protected other people and was a part of the solution to the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Hey check back with us in 18 months if you are still alive from your body filling up with spike proteins. If you escape an autoimmune disease of some serious nature in the next three years, I will be very surprised. I can tell astroturfer accounts by the way, you always have very low karma because some guy hired to spout corporate or political BS doesn't come across as authentic. 2 post karma? Funny how you all go get a new throw away account every week so there's little post history.  </p>
<p>I'm not harming anyone, the people who are being harmed now are the ones having blood clots, heart problems, etc, and who have businesses destroyed. You seriously think life is reopening, what a joke that is. I can see the vaccinated still wearing masks and being too afraid to meet inside here. You don't even know what herd immunity means.</p>

        <p>So you think having your body taken over by a protein from the outside is a good thing, sure fella. Nothing to shut it off either. Hope you don't need your immune system for anything else. It's busy. WHOOPS. Keep the calendar handy, that's all I got to say.</p>

        <p>You really don't have a basic clue to how any of this works. Like, zero. It's kinda fascinating, tbh.</p>
<p>The body doesn't get taken over by the protein lol. The vaccine makes some cells produce a part of the virus. That part is destroyed by the immune system. From that it learns how to destroy the virus. The mRNA itself is destroyed shortly after too. That's it, that's all that happens.</p>

        <p>Keep telling yourself that.</p>
<p>BTW, I am on the autistic spectrum [was considered gifted when young] and read pub med and research studies for fun. I did this before any Covid showed up. Due to having rare diseases I had to do my own research to stay alive.</p>
<p>Reading old studies related to SARS, mRNA vaccines was very revelatory.</p>
<p>these approaches is provided in Table 1.</p>
<p>Spike protein-based vaccines and antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV
Vaccines*   Advantages  Disadvantages
Full-length S protein <br>
Induces effective neutralizing-antibody and T-cell responses, as well as protective immunity
    Might induce harmful immune responses that cause liver damage or enhanced infection</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh add liver disease and ADE to your Calendar!</p>
<p>I even looked for intermediary studies using advanced searches to see how they fixed the immunological and liver problems. I couldn't find much. I couldn't find evidence of HOW THEY SOLVED THOSE THINGS.</p>

<p>You haven't presented anything of relevance. Old studies about what might be aren't of relevance. You could look at what sideeffects the vaccines actually cause in studies but you'd just say they're lying, so it doesn't really matter. You cherrypick the information that fits your narrative.</p>
