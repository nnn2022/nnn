    <strong>I don't consider the WuFlu to be a deadly disease. Here's why.</strong>
    <p><p>All of these lockdowns and draconian measures are happening as a result of people thinking it's a death sentence. I don't believe this to be true.</p>
<p>While yes, it has killed a few people (actual numbers to be disputed), the VAST majority of these deaths are in elderly care homes. </p>
<p>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-new-data-show-canada-ranks-among-worlds-worst-for-ltc-deaths/</p>
<p>Up to 81%. This implies the virus, while it may be contagious, can only kill those with a weakened immune system, or are already close to dying anyhow. </p>
<p>Morso only 6% of cases died only from the WuFlu. The other 94% had over 2 other diseases to work together to become deadly. This only further pushes the idea that you essentially have to be at risk in order to die.</p>
<p>Meantime.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis">Polio (poliomyelitis) mainly affects children under 5 years of age.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/h1n1-pandemic-death-numbers-like-season-flu-new-study-suggests/article15626681/">That's because where about 80 per cent of people who die from seasonal flu are 65 and older, between 62 per cent and 85 per cent of the people who succumbed to pandemic H1N1 were younger than 65.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/19-december-2019-ebola-drc/en/#:~:text=Of%20persons%20who%20have%20died,older%20were%20in%20the%20community.">Of persons who have died from EVD, death in the community occurred among 44% (80/182) of deaths among children under 1 year of age and 49% (145/294) of deaths among children 1-4 years of age. In contrast, 26% (575/2248) of deaths among persons aged 18 years or older were in the community.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6544a4.htm">Zika virus disease incidence is higher among persons aged 20â€“49 years.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51127090_Age_Patterns_of_Mortality_During_the_Black_Death_in_London_AD_1349-1350">Plague affects all the age groups and genders but the most vulnerable group comprises of young people in the age bracket of 12-45 years [1,Â 2]. Plague is endemic in Africa, Asia, South America, and North America with the majority of cases reported in Africa [3]. ...</a></p>
<p>Almost any other plauge/outbreak in human history has affected the young and healthy. </p>
<p>A virus that affects the young, healthy, working class is deadly as it's much harder to contain due to essential jobs. Whereas the WuFlu is easy to contain, you simply Quarantine the elderly and at risk while you get a herd immunity. </p>
<p>However, due to draconian lockdown laws, herd immunity has been postponed by months. As a result this has allowed the elderly and at risk to have more time to get infected and as a result, die. </p>
<p>This isn't a deadly disease, and we need to stop treating it as such.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah. Swine Flu was actually scarier, because according to initial reports it killed alot of young people. For whatever reason that never ended up happening on a large scale, but in theory it was a much more alarming pattern.</p>
<p>Really makes you wonder why this one is getting such a disproportionate reaction.</p>

        <p>OK, salty, why don't you go ahead and explain <em>scientifically</em>, why a disease which to healthy people is only a few times more lethal than seasonal flu justifies shutting everything down and leaving 10 million people without a job?</p>
<p>Two Weeks Later: Yeah, I didn't think so. Just another covidiot.</p>
