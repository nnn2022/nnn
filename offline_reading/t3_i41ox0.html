    <strong>Father just exploded at me for "not taking the pandemic seriously"</strong>
    <p><p>I knew something was off when I went downstairs to speak to my mom. He was quietly brooding, ignoring me. I'd been downstairs earlier, and I try to avoid the topic of the coronavirus, because of how extremely pro-lockdown he is combined with his short-fuse. He's constantly watching the news, and has a quite "high-strung" personality, no chill basically.</p>
<p>Earlier on corona had come up unexpectedly, and apparently in me changing the topic of conversation I had "brushed it off lightly" and made him feel extremely angry because I wasn't taking the lockdown seriously, and washing my hands enough. Full-blown glaring and shouting saying "it's okay for me because I'm young" (he's nearly 70) and saying I'm selfish, don't care about him, and brush off the pandemic as a "conspiracy". Mom crying and I just tried to leave the room as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I know I won't get an apology, I never will, I'll just get silent treatment.</p>
<p>I don't see a way out of this easily.</p></p>

        <p>Wow. It really is disgusting how the media has rot and corrupted everyone's brains. But what he did was emotional manipulation. Don't let it affect you. Understand he is a victim of a mass mental illness. The same one affecting so many people.</p>

        <p>While I think the media shoulders much of the blame, the public at large is also at fault for not critically thinking about what is being spoonfed to them, and also for their own fair share of partaking in shitty behavior like shaming, snitching, reacting violently, etc.</p>

        <p>This is basically a more severe form of certain discussions my husband and I tend to have with his mother. Every few days or weeks, after what seem to be several good enlightening conversations regarding the sociocultural climate, we butt heads because "rules are rules" and "they're just doing their job" because "they said on the news" or some asinine shit. To be fair, my mother-in-law is in her 60s. Old age happens, the elderly are genuinely more at risk, that concern is understandable. But her shitty diet and sedentary lifestyle is on her, why care about COVID so much if you don't care about your health any other time?</p>

        <p>What does that have to do with anything? This guy was talking about a situation in which his dad emotional manipulated him and you are moving the goalposts. Also, we are not the ones who just read headlines. Most of the people who do that are doomers. Personal anecdotes are not very useful though. Data is. Most of us get COVID is serious. But our response is disproportionate and panicked.</p>

        <p>Emotional manipulation is a stretch. Yes his dad sucks and isn't able to say properly community his feelings but he is concerned with his own health presumably the mom's too if her age is around his.
His point of view is he's seeing his son not take "lockdown seriously" and "washing his hands enough".
His son doesn't seem to care</p>
<p>Thats what his dad is saying.
OP doesn't say what his retort to that was.
Or what lead to yelling.
Not enough info.
OP although says he knows he won't get an apology his language shows he's wanting one, thats shitty, Thats how you build resentment.</p>

        <p>If you're referring to playing the victim or applying guilt as a technique of emotional manipulation. Is the dad actually playing victim when the actual risk is very real?</p>
<p>If and I mean IF what OPs dad saying is true where OP isn't taking proper safety precautions to keep his family safe, is he not then putting with at-risk family in danger? Does it not create a basis for his concern?
Not willing to sacrifice comfort to protect your family is selfish.</p>
<p>His actions or lack there of support a logic to believe his lack of caring. Not saying that he does but simply it can be understood why dad feels the way he does.</p>
<p>Btw another argument can be made that this post is just as emotionally manipulative in order to have elicited the emotional response of empathy from people on this site but whatever.</p>

        <p>Yes-coercing people to conform by saying things like "you don't care about me" is still emotionally manipulative. Sure if its his house he can set rules. I would take more safety precautions living with a 70 year old. But if he (rightfully) sees this is overblown and voices that or acts accordingly-that isn't "selfish" nor does it indicate a lack of concern for his dad. There is a genuine concern on the other hand that governments and media are using this crisis to scare and manipulate people into conformity. Similar to how many authoritarian regimes get their start.</p>

        <p>At best it was a brash way to convey that OPs relaxed behavior (assuming again that it's true) is concerning the dad.
Understand that when one tries to persuade another person the attempt alone can be construed as an emotion manipulation the term gets thrown around so much that its almost gross.</p>
<p>As you mentioned that you would take extra precautions if you lived with a 70. OPs post doesn't really state it any measures hes taken to provide adequate protection to them. Taking into account that op posted on this particular sub provides the belief that he doesn't take this pandemic seriously or skeptical isn't farfetched therfore one can believe he isn't taking the precautions to help keep them safe.
Being a skeptic is one thing but it lends itself to damaging ignorance far too easily.</p>
<p>Your last two sentences are exactly why I brought up the question if given the facts would you even believe them?
Believe me raging against the machine is important, systems NEED to be challenged to prove that they continue to be good system in the sense of governance. The current system isn't working its been challenged by a pandemic and its failed.
A virus isn't discriminatory it doesn't care if youre Rep, Dem, rich, poor, or whatever color you are. People need to try take care of each other. People's well being isnt somewhat that should be politicized.
And if you the think the authoritarian regines aren't already in power your pretty late to the race.</p>

<p>I really hope this is not how you conduct your interpersonal relationships. You will (rightfully) lose a lot of relationships this way.</p>
<p>&rt;Understand that when one tries to persuade another person the attempt alone can be construed as an emotion manipulation the term gets thrown around so much that its almost gross.</p>
<p>Persuasion would be explaining the risk to himself (whatever it is). It would be one thing if he got mad. Saying "you don't care about me" as a way of coercing another person to do what he says is emotional manipulation.  </p>

<p>Posting on here is a perfectly rational response to the mass hysteria we are seeing. Someone "not taking this seriously" by your definition is no excuse to hold your relationship over someone's head. Now again, if its his house-he can set rules accordingly. But I am not going to sit here and pretend what he said is not emotional manipulation. It 100% is. </p>
<p>&rt;And if you the think the authoritarian regines aren't already in power your pretty late to the race.</p>
<p>So we should just throw up our hands and let them?</p>

        <p>Op stated that dad told him his actions is what makes him feel like he doesn't care about him. Op was made to feel shitty but it seems that it isn't unfounded (provided that his behavioris true). He was just called out on it and no one wants to be attacked that way.
I don't want to believe OP doesn't care about his dad but it seems OP just cares about himself more.</p>
<p>Dad sounds like a prick who can't communicate his wants to his son without being abrassive.
OP sounds like a brat, who doesn't believe his actions have consequences.</p>
<p>Lastly, of course not. LIke I said systems need to be challenged.
But this sub is politicizing a pandemic That's what this sub seems to be. All I see posted are things downplaying what's going on and promoting that some one/group is behind the current state.
The virus has no agenda, the virus is real.</p>
<p>People should fight oppression. protest them, donate to causes that support equality for all. Help out your fellow man. That's how you fight short actually drawing arms.
But somehow operating with the contention that the global pandemic isn't serious and taking proven measures that minimize the affects of said pandemic by saying those safety measures enfringe on rights and freedoms. Is like having a wild fire in your backyard then being angry at the firemen telling you to get out of the house.</p>

        <p>It isn't politicizing it to state the obvious fact that this is being blown WAY out of proportion. Is it horrible? Yes. But we need to keep it in perspective so we can make rational decisions and not completely abandon ANYTHING in society we cared about pre-COVID. Republicans and Democrats both. IDGAF about party.</p>
