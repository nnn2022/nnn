        <p>That's a really broad question.</p>
<p>For me it boils down to this: is the virus real and deadly in certain populations? Yeah, likely. Should people be encouraged to voluntarily follow certain measures to limit spread? Sure.</p>
<p>That said, under no circumstances does that justify the amount of power that's been seized by governments to implement authoritarian measures. Certain things (freedom of speech/expression, religion, association, bodily autonomy) are not to be touched for a reason. These are all decisions that should be left to the individual, and the turn we've taken sets a horrible precedent for the future. Even if you agree with it now, governments will never relinquish those powers, including when the people you don't like get elected.</p>
<p>The merging of medicine and politics is also a disturbing precedent, and something that's been abused in the past with disastrous results. Tuskegee, MKUltra, and the USSR's "sluggish schizophrenia" immediately come to mind.</p>
<p>I'd rather die of the virus than have my children grow up in the world we're creating, and that should be my choice to make, no one else's.</p>

        <p>It is true that governments currently are taking a lot of freedoms, however here in Australia they have given them back minus every few months where there is an outbreak, Australia had its new normal for a while and now every thing is back to normal. It’s sad seeing the news and seeing other countries are not so fortunate</p>

        <p>Even in cases where they've been "given back", the damage has been done. They've proven that as long as you stir up enough fear (which is apparently disturbingly easy to do), you can shit all over the rights and freedoms of the populace and they'll sit back and take it. Now there's absolutely nothing stopping them from doing the same thing over and over for political gain.</p>
<p>At the end of the day my position is a moral/ethical one. Any attempt to forcefully stop people from gathering, or protesting, or wearing what they want, or going to church/temple/mosque (and I'm an atheist), or going to work, or making their own medical decisions, is tyranny; and when tyranny is law, rebellion is duty. I don't care how "justified" or "temporary" it is, no man should have that kind of power over his fellow man.</p>

        <p>I can understand that.</p>
<p>Maybe Australia is different, I'm in Canada. Until disturbingly recently, we kidnapped native children and forced them into government schools; the last one was closed in 1996. We were part of MKUltra and have people suing the government to this day for the devastation it caused. We've had the feds destroy the economy of some provinces for political gain in others. We've had pretty constant mass disarmament and our laws on freedom of speech are weak. I can't in good conscience support the state gaining this level of power just <em>hoping</em> they won't abuse it, because history has shown they will.</p>
<p>I hope I've at least convinced you that the people here mostly hold a rational position (agree with it or not), not just conspiracy theory bullshit. For what it's worth, it's been really nice having a civil discussion with someone I disagree with and being heard out. I miss when this was commonplace.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I really have no idea where that image came from or how we maintain it. In my city, we just threw a fucking pastor in jail for a month because he refused to stop holding services, as his faith compelled him to do. If that's not a dystopian nightmare I don't know what is.</p>

        <p>Alright, how can you justify lockdowns to such extent where people are missing out on all other treatments, deaths and life altering disease preventable but because of this mess they been ignored. Are their lives worth less? How can you justify the total shutdown of businesses, and that economy is close to collapse with inevitable approach of extreme inflation that will cause poverty followed by more diseases, starvation, violence. How can you justify the endless mental health problems increase, suicidal ideation and self harm has increased by 20% in 2020 amongst the teenagers- our children, so we would "protect" vulnerable and immunocompromised, how is their lives and futures less valuable? Isn't it selfish? Wouldn't it be smarter to shield ones that are actually alt risk instead of EVERYONE? Even though everyone that's not at risk has an amazing 99.7% survival rate, there's more chance I'll die from autocrash than this virus. It's living in fear at it's best. If you scared to live- stay at home, why you have to demonize people who wants to live normal life calling them selfish? I find that extremely hypocritical as you're asking an individual to hand over all their liberties just so you could feel safer. </p>
<p>Now about vaccine, it's been pushed down to people with no long term safety date, the pharma's refuse to take any responsibility if there's any side effects. How can this be deemed safe if the company created it doesn't believe it to be liable for its side effects? Not to mention that it doesn't prevent the spread, or catching virus at all. Reports on how many people died and received serious side effects is astonishing, and to stay "it's only minority" is idiotic as "one death from COVID is one too many" but one death from vaccine is justifiable. 
 That's from the top of my head.  Open to see what you have to respond.</p>

        <p>Did you read what I wrote? Undeniably more people suffered from the lockdowns and will continue to pay the price for it than actually benefited. People die each day from many causes, that's life mate, it's sad but can't shut down life for that reason. If government truly cared for your health and life, alcohol, tobacco and junk food but wouldn't be accessible as it is now. Just Google how many deaths yearly does these reasons cause, how many diseases that leads to, yet, this poison is easily accessible, so no, government couldn't care less about your health, wake up.</p>

        <p>Well that's the thing, your freedoms should never been taken away. All the problems this caused is irreversible, the matter is that it cannot be allowed to continue further. But don't be fooled- government saw how obedient and compliant people are once you take away their freedoms. Thus, people are incredibly easy to manipulate, and this won't be last time you end up stripped down from your freedoms, that's just the beginning. Have you watched "The economy forum" and their plans? It's an official alliance with a public plan to be implemented by 2030. Look up on YT, whatever they doing right now, is to have that plan fully established. Just connect the dots https://youtu.be/nL1HuTYcoC4 this is from Sky News Australia, it's not conspiracy it's an actual plan.  And you know what's worse? In Israel this whole insanity took to another level https://youtu.be/fCclJghk7Vs . Research more, media is insanely corrupted right now, everything that opposes their ideology is taken down, it's hard to find the truth but those who look for it will find it :)</p>
