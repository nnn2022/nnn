        <p>Is actually simple math:</p>
<p>2020: no flu, no colds, no pneumonia etc . No excess of total deaths compared with the last 10 years in fact almost every country had less deaths.
Excuse: masks, lockdowns, social distance. But what about covid? Ah covid is much more contagious that's why. - ok benefit of doubt.</p>
<p>Sweden: no flu, no cold, no pneumonia etc. No excess of deaths compared to the last 10 years (actually less). No masks, no social distance, no lockdowns.
Excuse: .........................................</p>
<p>They can invent whatever they want with covid numbers, tests that aren't tests etc. But simple math don't lie.</p>

<p>There many issues with lockdowns and pandemic management, but sweden is not an example of a good outcome.</p>
<p>Though admittedly, latest figures are still being processed.</p>
<p>The problem with all this is the inability to reconcile the experiences of many many health workers with the reports on this sub of it all being fake and overblown. We are admitting far more people and seeing far more deaths. Those we are admiting as COVID have a combination of problems and presentations are are starkly different to any form of viral pneumonias that we have seen in our living memory. I don't know why this sub doesn't acknowledge this and simply attacks it as lies, or a very specific example of only my personal experience.</p>

        <p>I do have other things to do with me time.</p>
<p>There isn't one, the simple stat of total deaths misses the mortality burden of COVID, the changes in behaviour and activity that will effect other mortality causes and, more importantly, the morbidity of the disease.</p>
<p>In short, look this disease purely in total death count is way too grossly reductionist - same as cancer, heart disease, stroke etc. Is that simple enough for you?</p>

        <p>Not simple enough.</p>
<p>If in the last 10 years until 2019 you have a media as example around 80000 who died total,if there is a "new virus" that is killing a lot of people, you would expect that in 2020 that number would be way higher since you have to add all the new deaths from the new deadly virus, in a place like Sweden that had hardly any restrictions compared with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And you still would have to explain how comes that this year also in Sweden there's no more deaths from other respiratorie illnesses such as influenza, colds, pneumonia etc, all this deaths are re assigned to covid. </p>
<p>That is simple math.</p>

<p>No, it is trying to reduce the discussion to one particular point to exclude any other facet of these events.</p>
<p>&rt;If in the last 10 years until 2019 you have a media as example around 80000 who died total,if there is a "new virus" that is killing a lot of people, you would expect that in 2020 that number would be way higher since</p>
<p>The data omits half a month of the second peak, which is quite significant. I have also not seen data about what other diseases have been less frequently killing, whilst sweden has not formally locked down, it did informally distance and changing lifestyle etc</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&rt;And you still would have to explain how comes that this year also in Sweden there's no more deaths from other respiratorie illnesses such as influenza, colds, pneumonia etc, all this deaths are re assigned to covid. </p>
<p>I can't comment on the Swedish method of ascribing COVID death. In my country, those thiqings have continued to exist but have not been the iverwhwlmint cause of deterioration and death in our admissions. We CT almost every admission and they are very much a predominantly COVID picture.</p>

        <p>Man I speak with my friends in Sweden basically every day, my friend send me video from parties, restaurants, gyms and life went as normal as it gets. Also what you're missing info from the 18th of December? Should I look for it? Will I find thousands of deaths in those 12 days? I doubt it, it will still be on the annual media. Also friendly reminder Sweden is full of refugees and Arabs that they kiss 3 times when they say hello and many of them are pretty wild people. From all the footage my friend sent me I have not seen one person with a mask and it look like the old world used to look. </p>
<p>You're entitled to believe whatever you want. For me it's pretty obvious what's going on, but if you want to believe what the tv say you're welcome.</p>
<p>Ah and btw. I move between Paris (epicenter of the disaster) Chambéry (epicenter of the French disaster) and Milan (neighbor to the epicenter of where everything started) I don't know not one person that had a serious case let alone died. </p>
<p>Study PCR and how they "discover" and "purify" the virus. 
If you want to think I'm dumb you're in your right to do so.  I have yet have to see a prove that there's a new virus around. </p>
<p>And you have yet to explain how did flu, colds, pneumonia had disappeared in 2020.</p>

        <p>I am a doctor, I have used PCR in biomedical research, I know exacrly what it is and the confused bashing of it in this sub.. Your absence of experience of COVID mortality means literally fuck all.   I have meet about 15 COVID deaths in the last week. Nothint about my opinion is TV informed.</p>
<p>What proof do you need? Genomic sequencing? EM? Histological evidence? </p>
<p>&rt;Will I find thousands of deaths in those 12 days?</p>
<p>I don't know, isn't that the point? The peak was 40 deaths a day I think for sweden, so potentially around 500.</p>

        <p>Ah so you're a doctor, I appreciate even more that you engage with me in this conversation.</p>
<p>You should be qualified to answer how come influenza, colds, pneumonia and other respiratorie illnesses have eradicated during 2020.</p>
<p>I think I simple proof would be that a country like Sweden which didn't have tight restrictions hasn't had an significant excess of deaths. That btw when Sweden was taking its position regarding restrictions the whole world was saying that they all where going to die (which never happened) (so did most governments say that hospitals will become war zones while they were pretty empty)</p>
<p>RT PCR technology wasn't created as a test. The creator of the technology (Nobel prize winner) said it should not be used as a diagnosis tool. He said that it amplifies molecules and that there's not so many molecules that aren't in the human body. Also you should know that there's no standard for PCR "tests" and all have different cycles the more cycles the more likely to find a positive results and coincidentally the countries with more "cases" they have the highest cycles. </p>
<p>The way that the isolated or purified covid 19 involves software to complete the sequence. </p>
<p>So far such things has tested positive for covid 19:</p>
<p>Kiwi
Goat
Bird
Coca cola 
Papaya
Pawpaw
Durian
Apple Juice 
Blank test</p>
<p>I'm really curious if you're engaging with me because you want to school me or if because you might not believe the main narrative yourself, which by the way it would put you licence at risk. Do you believe the MSM narrative religiously.</p>
<p>However I do appreciate a lot that you do engage with me due your professional opinion. I haven't finished highschool personally, but I speak fluently 5 languages and been in more the 25 countries. </p>
<p>Once again I thank you for engaging with me and sorry If you feel disrespected. But I think we should be able to have this conversation.</p>

        <p>&rt;You should be qualified to answer how come influenza, colds, pneumonia and other respiratorie illnesses have eradicated during 2020.</p>
<p>I have addressed that already, see above. We see a lot of both simultaneously, the predominant disease becomes the  recorded disease. Anecdotally, I have seen far far less of standard bacterial pneumonias and simple viral LRTIs, or rather if present they are a minor aspects.</p>
<p>&rt;RT PCR technology wasn't created as a test. The creator of the technology (Nobel prize winner) said it should not be used as a diagnosis tool.</p>
<p>But it has been effectively done.so for decades for myriad infections. Got hepatitis? PCR for viral load. Same for HIV, EBV etc etc none of this is novel.</p>
<p>&rt;Also you should know that there's no standard for PCR "tests" and all have different cycles the more cycles the more likely to find a positive results and coincidentally the countries with more "cases" they have the highest cycles. </p>
<p>Every sample we get had the PCR count, I rarely see much above 20. I am aware of those fruit stories but we are aware of the very high cycle counts and more spurious samples. To be honest, they have not been a problem with hospital care.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm really curious if you're engaging with me because you want to school me or if because you might not believe the main narrative yourself, which by the way it would put you licence at risk. Do you believe the MSM narrative religiously.</p>
<p>I believe the infection is real and cause significant death, either independently or in combination, more often in xomvination I suspect. I strongly hate our current reality, and am concerned by inefficacy and wish for correction ASAP but feel that this sub and community is an incredibly poor advocate and deeply self defeating, infested with luddites. All too many are unable to really explain their concerns or even the basic elements of the science they question. In many ways the ardent pro lockdowns and the ardent people here are the same unthinking zealots just from different perspectives.</p>
<p>What particularly annoy me is the obsession with death count as the be all of what matters here. Yes it matters, but we see far more blood clots, cardiac injury, new diabetes, renal failure and permanent pulmonary injury that I do death - that is the real burden on hospitals, society and ppl - and is frankly ignored.</p>
<p>&rt;MSM narrative religiously</p>
<p>I am front line currently, I work in my capital city and my friends and colleagues cover specialist services in many medical fields in many cities, through that alone I receive probably more information then I do from the MSM. All the MSM does is give mr stats.</p>

        <p>I think that the same MSM media bias exists in those doubters of COVID and lockdowns, just from a different source. This is not a reflection of you, but how half truths are used to force an agenda.</p>
<p>I believe that most of what I wrote is accurate and I can support with sources if that would help. Similarly I am happy to continue to discuss any matters if you would like, I believe there are significant points of divergence and convergence between us.</p>

        <p>I do appreciate a lot the respect and you use to reply, specially since you're a doctor and I didn't finish high school. I'm really happy that you engaged with me to this point, and this final reply with such politeness make you earn nothing but respect from my side. Is a bit late on my side of the world and tomorrow I have some sort of important day. 
Also I think is so important that we are able to even have this conversation. I want to thank you so much for taking the time and respect to reply even knowing that I don't have any kind of official certification to speak about the subject. I also want to thank you to be in the side of the ones that wants to help, save lives and educate. I'll be glad if we could beep talking about it tomorrow. Once again thank you for your patience and open mindedness. 🙏🏻</p>

<p>I stick to simple math, as you see in that link Sweden had total around same deaths as in the last 10 years. How do you explain that? Is a very simple question</p>
<p>I'm about to move to Sweden, I speak every week with my friends in Sweden, they say life is pretty much normal. </p>

        <p>I don't bother with the other subs, I heard you get banned right away and even in this sub I did posted and I did not get one person agreeing that there's no new virus, most people believe there's a new virus that is either man made or not as dangerous. </p>
<p>By now I already lost faith, we are talking the most simple kind of math, no politics, no faulty tests, no interests, just the most simple kind of math. </p>
<p>The problem is that accepting this is accepting being scammed like a child about Santa Claus (i also didn't want to accept that Santa didn't exist and I was very disappointed when I did accept it). Most people aren't ready to accept that the decieve could go this far. Is not about common sense is about not accepting the posibilitiy of being scammed to this degree.</p>

<p>I've stopped researching it all and given up arguing about it because it just doesn't achieve anything. I'm focusing on manifesting a more positive future now and giving less and less energy to all the negativity surrounding this 'crisis'</p>

        <p>I totally understand you, I was today talking with my girlfriend about it and Mentioned that she shouldn't talk about with her family unless they ask for it, because she would be treated as crazy and she would feel bad about it. So I totally get your point.  However shit is about to get real, they are about to inject us with something that I have no idea what it is and I'll be on my way to a country where I will not need to do that, and just out of precaution I will stay away of people who would get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>You’re right on 2019, statbel confirms that. I’m not sure where you’re getting the 113,333 total from, <a href="https://statbel.fgov.be/en/about-statbel/what-we-do/visualisations/mortality"> as the statistical office had noted 122,133 deaths on December 20th already </a>. Given how about 350 people were dying every day in Belgium another 11*350 = 3850 deaths should be added, totalling to 125,983 total deaths or a 16% increase in total deaths. That might be a slight underestimate of the total amount of deaths though, <a href="https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/momo/">since the daily death average was around 390-400 in the middle of December. </a></p>

        <p>20% More would be 133.171 not 123.133</p>
<p>Also is probably the only country that I've heard that has more deaths compared with 2019 at least so far. I know that Belgium has a really high suicide rate. I don't know if this  10.000 more deaths are the ultimate proof that there's a new virus around given that most countries didn't have excess of deaths they actually had less and that includes Italy where the pandemic actually started.</p>

        <p>I don't pretend to know one way or the other. All I know is that I'm not afraid of catching it. I see no reason to be afraid. Everyone I know who's had it have had minor cold/flu symptoms. I don't believe in asymptomatic spread. I had to keep my kid home today because he has symptoms. He tests tomorrow so he can go back to school next week. I'd like to just get it and get it over with so I have even more reason to decline the vaccine. I wouldn't be surprised if we've already had it and didn't know it.</p>

        <p>i know there is a narrative that C19 does not exist "because the CDC has no quantified 2019 nCov probes" or something along these lines</p>
<p>but lets take a step back</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>there basically is a new coronavirus every year, just as there is sort of a new influenza virus every year going around</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>based on that it would not be far fetched to believe that in 2020 we dealt with the covid 19 virus. in other words it would be weird if there was no corona in 2020 or any other year</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>this is why i believe covid19 is a real virus. another virus that kills thousands. unfortunately for questionable reasons humanity absolutely overreacted this time</p>

        <p>There can be a new "flu strain" as there always is claimed to be (though no matter the "strain", influenza has never been proven to be the cause of any disease or transmissible &amp; the theory has been disproven for over 100 years).  </p>
<p>But that doesnt mean the never been proven to exist bat soup virus exists.  If it did, there would be no shortage of biological isolates, yet there admittedly remain zero.      It does not exist, it is only "believed" by those practicing faith in the evidence-free &amp; liability-free claims of criminals.   </p>
<p>Belief has no role.  It is the absence of science which is the culture of doubt.   Those applying belief in fraudulent claims and practicing cult rituals for those beliefs are the only reason the only categories of excess deaths (suicide &amp; drug overdose) are at all time record highs.  The total number of deaths is the same as prior years despite the doubling in suicides; the nonexistent virus didnt "kill" anyone, but people's blind belief and submission to cult rituals resulted in record level suicides.    </p>
<p>Hopefully as those individuals wake up to their participation in the attempted genocide, they'll cease blindly believing what theyre told and start requiring verifiable evidence for false on the facd, liability-free claims.</p>
