        <p>The asbestos story is interesting. How it was ever allowed to become so prevalent in our environment, our dwellings is beyond me. </p>
<p>We have known for thousands of years that asbestos is a killer. The Greeks and Romans used to use it for cloths and eating and drinking vessels. Both the Greeks and Romans observed and noted that the workers who made such products were dying due to lung issues.</p>
<p>Yet, in the 20th century, asbestos was for some reason allowed to be forced into all our dwellings.</p>
<p>I understand that asbestos as a material has some incredible properties and why these properties are ideal for construction purposes. But I can't understand how despite knowing how dangerous it is, why it was even considered and permitted for such uses in our everyday environment given its deadly nature.</p>

        <p>No one was proposing asbestos as a medical treatment. It was simply not investigated what effects asbestos would have on people’s long term health. The effects of the vaccines have been studied and we know what they do on a molecular level. If there were catastrophic dangers they would be well documented in the trials preceding approval.</p>

        <p>Do you have a time machine? How on earth are you so confident these vaccines do not cause long term heart damage? It is literally impossible to know, despite how many studies have been done over the past 12 months.</p>

        <p>I am confident that they don’t cause long term heart damage because no information I have seen has conclusively shown there to be any such relationship. We know what the vaccine does in the body, and none of those things seem to point to any significant long term injuries. No one ever checked what impact asbestos would have when breathed in. We have been developing vaccines for almost a century now with the specific focus being what effects they have on the body. If the studies being made aren’t showing that there is a relationship, and there’s no significant reason to assume a relationship, I will ignore the theoretical possibility of a relationship to get the positive results of the vaccine. It’s a little like people who were concerned about cellphone radiation. Sure, there is a small potential chance, but it remains undemonstrated and the benefits to having a mobile phone or getting the vaccine outweigh the potential risks that haven’t been proven to exist.</p>

<p>None of the vaccines we have had for decades use mRNA technology. Comparisons are moot. </p>
<p>Again, unless you have a literal time machine you cannot know that what you are saying is true. You can *believe* it. You can *hope* it. You cannot know it.</p>

        <p>Good source, hadn’t seen that development. But very rare at 12.6 per million doses.</p>
<p>It is true that none of the vaccines we have had have been mRNA vaccines, but they are a development of years upon years of research and development. mRNA vaccines have been in the works for a long time, it is not as if scientists threw this one together from scratch in a year with some new method. The research behind the mRNA vaccines is solid and well understood. Rare side effects occur with almost all medical treatments. </p>
<p>I cannot <em>know</em> that there is no risk just as you cannot <em>know</em> that there is. That lack of concrete knowledge in either direction means that I do not factor it in heavily. I cannot <em>know</em> that going to space causes kidney failure 20 years down the line, just as you don’t <em>know</em> the opposite. 12.6 cases in a million doses does not constitute a significant correlation, and is not something I would be concerned by.</p>

        <p>Sure, very little in life is truly knowable. We are constrained by human senses and cognition, which most people won't admit are woefully limited. History has shown us that science is slow. It can take decades before people realize medical treatments are more harmful than helpful (see: cocaine, opiates, bloodletting, drilling holes in the skull, douching...).</p>
<p>I may very well be wrong, but the idea that injecting something into my body that instructs it to produce harmful proteins HAS to have some downside. There are literally no magical, side-effect free drugs, especially ones that interact with DNA. The idea that it just "works" and then leaves your body is infantile at best.</p>
<p>I suppose you will discredit Robert Malone, who was heavily involved in the development of mRNA technology 30 years ago and is now sounding the alarm on this huge vaccine push, so it's not even worth trying to argue the points you made.</p>
