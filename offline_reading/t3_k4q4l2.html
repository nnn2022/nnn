    <strong>When Do You Think Things Will Go Back To Normal?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm just wondering when you guys think we'll go back to normal. I know it seems like never, but what do you think? I absolutely will not ever wear a face diaper, haven't since this whole thing began, and I also have religious objections to wearing one, but I've noticed my vision getting worse because I am overdue for an eye exam. I was supposed to go in April. Putting on a face diaper is not an option for me. Do you guys think once there's a vaccine we will be back to normal? I know probably not, though. Also, do you have any ideas for what I could do? I've tried telling them it's religious discrimination, but that doesn't help because they don't care. Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>In the US, we've been told that the vaccine will not ensure normalcy. Of course, that was after some months of being told that it would. And that was after some months of being told isolation and muzzles would.</p>

        <p>The muzzle and isolation were just a test run to guage the degree of conformity and obedience by people. </p>

        <p>I think showing people jumping out of buildings in a continuous loop 20 years ago and seeing what we'd be willing to have taken away was the initial test. I haven't owned a television since.</p>

        <p>It won't, ever. I'm not saying we are going to definitely have a full scale civil war, police state etc (we probably will) but "normal" ? That's gone. Mourn it now so you'll be over it if shit really hits the fan and you need a level head.</p>
<p>One of the most ridiculous, petty things I'm having trouble accepting is the loss of the zoo. We'll never conform so we will never get to go to a zoo again and it's my son's favorite place ever and he talks about it almost daily. 
He's too young to fully grasp the world right now so I just tell him we can't go, they're closed unless you wear a mask... He doesn't realize that means forever. He'll never see a gorilla or a tiger or a komodo dragon again.. because of a fucking mask, and then vaccine, and then the fact we'll probably have to full scale hide away to keep them out of forced public school to prevent their being policed, vaccinated and forced to conform while they're still young and easy to mold.</p>
<p>It's a tiny, small, not even important thing in our lives but I fucking hope every one of these motherfuckers meets their maker while strung up in a public, slow, painful execution for taking so many childhoods away. They deserve no mercy. They are doing this on purpose.</p>

        <p>I have a lot of petty things that I am having trouble accepting, so you will not get judgement from me! The zoo is certainly one of them, as is theme parks. My daughter is turning 2 this month and I think I may just bite the bullet and do the zoo while the mask mandate doesn't affect her..ugh. </p>
<p>I am also sitting here fretting about my governor's speech this afternoon and worrying that my daughter's gymnastics class will be cancelled this weekend because her classes are literally the highlight of my week. How is that for sad?</p>

        <p>Where do you live? I'm in Arizona and I think the zoo near my town is open (might have to wear masks there, not sure).
Some parts of the US are far less totalitarian than others right now. Some countries are far less totalitarian than others right now.</p>

        <p>I'm in the Midwest and our zoo is open but everything indoor is closed, all educational activities are closed, you have to mask up, you have to maintain distance (n a <em>zoo</em> full of children !), And you have to purchase tickets online for a specific time slot which are impossible to get to anyway. </p>
<p>I've read a lot of stuff online from visitors this year and apparently there's a bunch of asshole Doomers there crying danger if someone doesn't abide... Y'all are so scared but not scared enough to not come to a friggin zoo ? Why are you not staying home saving lives !?</p>

        <p>We might go back to no masks, schools being open, businesses open, etc. But, this has fundamentally changed a lot of things. The same way that things never went back quite the way they were after the great depression, or WWI/WWII.</p>
<p>The government has increased surveillance, businesses could potentially be shut down for emergency orders at any time, the wealth of giant corporations has increased significantly, the government debt is through the roof, propaganda is everywhere all the time, and people are increasingly becoming beholden to the government.</p>
<p>I do believe that countries will open their borders back up and lockdowns will end. However, a lot of freedoms have been lost and I don't know when they will return, if ever.</p>

        <p>If by some miracle, life does one day go back to normal, I feel like as soon as people start getting sick again they'll readily go back to this. I've heard lots of people saying "I can see this happening during flu season as a precaution." It's just so sickening.</p>

        <p>I honestly feel sorry for the kids growing up during this time (that includes my own child who will not know any differently since she is only 2). </p>
<p>I honestly can't even give a guess at this point. Back in April, I thought things would be back to normal by late May/early June. And I know it sounds bad, but I was actually happy with the BLM protests started happening because I thought it meant we could get back to normal. </p>
<p>If I had to put my reverse doomer hat on - I think masks and social distancing will be around for years. Maybe eventually masks will not be technically required anymore but no one is going to come out and say "you don't have to wear masks anymore if you don't want to." I think eventually mask mandates will expire and people will gradually wear masks less and less. I can't even picture a time when crowds are "allowed" again - people freak the fuck out if they see pictures of family gatherings for crying out loud. And concerts, festivals? Holy hell..who knows when those will return. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I think kids will be required to wear masks at school for a long time. I don't think after school activities, field trips, assemblies, school sports will be a thing at school for a good while. </p>
<p>I think healthcare workers, restaurant staff, retail workers, teachers, flight attendants, pilots, theme park employees, basically anyone who has to be around the public for work will have to wear a mask for a long time. I think working from home will be the norm for another 2 years or so because there will always be a bunch of whiners who will refuse to come into the office because they don't feel safe.</p>
<p>Sorry, I am not in a good mood because my governor is supposed to talk this afternoon and I know my state is going back to Phase 1...</p>

        <p>I can't decide who I feel worse for... Kids that will have memory of before or kids who do but can't fully understand what had happened.</p>
<p>Mine are of the latter age and while it's devastating to see everything they're losing at least they have the memories.. yours just <em>won't</em> and it's infuriating.</p>
<p>I think when it comes down to it the kids I feel the absolute worst are those of any age that have doomer parents. Imagine intentionally teaching your child they're so dangerous they can't have friends or hug their grandma. It's psychological abuse.. full stop.</p>

        <p>I feel the worst for kids who have doomer parents, especially for kids old enough to understand how much their life sucks. I then feel bad for kids who are old enough to remember what the past was like and understand what they are missing out on with where the world is right now. Then I feel bad for the kids who don't fully understand what happened and who are being raised to believe they are walking "plague rats" as doomers so lovingly call it (diseased-ridden crotch goblins is another fun phrase).</p>
<p>And I feel bad for the kids (like mine) who won't know any different. If those kids do not have doomer parents, then I think they will be somewhat okay.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I think eventually (maybe after a year or so) the mask mandates will just quietly expire and not be renewed. Not sure how that works. But no one will say they are no longer mandated; people will just gradually wear them less and less. But that is just normal people going grocery shopping or to their local playground. </p>
<p>I think masks will be around for longer than that at schools and places that tend to get crowded, like theme parks, zoos, etc.</p>

        <p>It makes my blood boil too. I have to stop myself from complaining too much around my 11 year old step-daughter. She kind of understands what she is missing out on but she has no idea of the extent of it. And I don't want to depress her. She started 6th grade back in August and she is still doing virtual school. It has sucked. She should be meeting new friends in middle school, trying out for school sports, attending football games, looking forward to her first school dance, etc. But she's wasting away in virtual school for the time being. And even when my state allows middle school to open back up next year, she will have to wear a mask all day and I highly doubt school will be anything more than just sitting in a class with a mask on and then going home. </p>
<p>I can't talk about all of that with her. So I complain here!</p>

        <p>Thanks for all the responses. I have been trying to keep hope alive, but I kind of know that things will never be normal, at least for a long time. I just wish the protests actually did something, because there are obviously enough people against this crap to make change, but nothing ever changes. I feel like they've won at this point, to an extent. I mean, I will never comply, but because so many people just let them have their way with our rights, now that they've done it, it will never go back to normal. This should have never happened in the first place. Not the virus, but the reaction to it. What's worse is that many of the people against this are older, you don't see many young people against it. The youth is the future, and that's what scares me.</p>

        <p>"A doomer is someone who believes in doomerism, a philosophy and mindset that believes global problemsâ€”including but not limited to ecological exhaustion, such as overpopulation, peak oil, climate change, and pollutionâ€”will inevitably cause the collapse of civilization, significant losses in human population, and potentially lead to eventual human extinction. The ideology is defined in opposition to more optimistic outlooks on life. Doomers believe that government corruption, civilian apathy, and/or structural oppression are unfixable." - Wikipedia</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s on everyone personally to live their lives normally.  The scared people will still be scared and will eventually just go along with the majority.  Theyâ€™re weak minded people who are just followers.  I on the other hand just live my life normally with no masks and donâ€™t worry about what others think.  Fuck em.</p>
