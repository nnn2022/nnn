    <strong>Masks aren't good enough</strong>
    <p><p>I'm 37 weeks pregnant so I am in that window of going into labor anytime now and three weeks. Went to my birthing center yesterday for one of my weekly prenatal appointments, and they ask the same covid19 questions every time - verbally. One of the questions includes if I had been in contact with anyone from the danger zone states. </p>
<p>Now, I generally try to be truthful in everything so I told them I had my father visited from one of the states (he visited for my birthday). The lady's eyes went wide and told me that they would have to see what the midwife needs to be done. When she returned she told me what the following procedure would be: that I would have to wait in my car and wait to have my blood pressure and fetal heartrate taken. I asked if I could use the restroom before I went back to my car and was denied because of policy.</p>
<p>I wait in my car and after a while I see the midwife at my passenger door. She's decked out head to toe wearing a face mask, a face shield, her hair is tied back, a long sleeve medical gown, and gloves. Like it might as well been a hazemat suit they were wearing. I get that it is most likely policy so they don't lose any licenses and can still operate (who knows if I'm a snitch you know). Still felt bad that she was decked out and outside in the hot sun.</p>
<p>I was then told I would need to take a covid test and test negative to give birth at the birth center and if I were to go into labor beforehand that I would have to deliver at the hospital instead. So after the appointment ended I managed to get to the testing center before they closed. Got my test done and get this, they allowed me to use the restroom there. </p>
<p>Bottom line: It's not good enough that I and everyone in the birthing center were wearing masks. The virus must be sitting all over my body just by being in contact with someone from out of state. Then why the masks? There should just be a full body suit mandate (sarcasm).</p></p>
