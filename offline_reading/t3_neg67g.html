        <p>Zombies are dumb Hollywood stuff.</p>
<p>But if they ever did pop out, those of us who have the courage to be out fighting the COVID tyranny would be the same ones out fighting the zombies.</p>
<p>The ones panicking about COVID and staying locked in their homes waiting for someone else to tell them it's safe, would also do the same thing if zombies were out there.  They'd eventually starve before they dare to leave their homes and fight.</p>

        <p>You know it's funny, I was thinking about the zombie-covid link a while ago.  This comment is for anyone familiar with the conspiracy theory of predictive programming.</p>
<p>So for many years leading up to covid, it seemed like there were zombies everywhere.  So many tv shows and movies were about zombies.  Just zombies, zombies, zombies everywhere.  And I remember thinking at some point (well before covid), I wonder why there are so many shows about zombies.  From a predictive programming standpoint, I wondered what they were trying to condition the public for.</p>
<p>And then, when people really started getting hysterical about covid, I wondered if this was why.  Were people being conditioned to fear other people, fear plagues, fear being outside, etc. with all the zombies shows and movies?</p>
<p>This whole idea central to the zombie story of other people being dangerous, and don't get too close to other people because they might infect you, etc.  The idea that they can't be saved, that they're not human anymore.  Don't show them any love or compassion because they'll just infect or kill you.  And also the fear voiced in this thread, that someone can be infected but you won't know it until it's too late and they kill you.</p>
<p>I wonder if it got into people's heads and affected their reactions to covid.</p>

        <p>Might very well be. It certainly does its fair share of affecting peoples minds, but I dont think Zombies are particularly hurtfull when it comes to these messages.</p>
<p>Id like to add a few points to consider as Im somewhat of a Zombie-Expert:</p>
<p>- The "modern Zombie" started by George Romeo, was partly a critique to the "zombie-like" behaviour of the modern human. As such it does not only display an infectious Threat, but also "dehumanizes" your average mall-shopper, smartphone user, vote-or-die, whatever human.</p>
<p>- Zombies gained a lot of popularity not only by chance. Because regulations on violence displayed in games and movies was much more strict back in the day, using tricks such as fighting Zombies instead of actual humans would allow games and movies to circumvent censorship and make them available to a larger audience by lowering the age-restrictions.</p>

        <p>You're exactly right, although the data I see shows an even lower death rate. Here's a John's Hopkins analysis ( https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality ). You'll see most of the countries have a survival rate more like 99.999. </p>
<p>If covid was really as deadly as people say, it would be something ridiculous like the third leading cause of death. We really see though that more people die from falling coconuts than covid: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/social-media/mm7014e1_COVID19ProvisionalMortality_IMAGE_31March21_v2_1200x675-medium.jpg</p>

        <p>What this idiot and most other people fail to recognize is that the &rt;99% survivability only applies to infected people.  For everyone else, it's. . . 100%!!  For instance, in the US, there have been, so far, about 33 million cases.  That means that after over a year, only about 10% of people have been infected.  Coincidentally, I'm sure, research shows that over 90% of people might already be immune due to cross T-cell immunity from previous corona infection (the cold you had up to 20 years ago).  So 90% immune, 10% infected with the 'Rona = everyone has already had it that will have it, and we've truly reached herd immunity.  Whatever is still going on is just a continuation of the psyop.  Don't fall for it.</p>
