    <strong>Great talk with tech support</strong>
    <p><p>Called webroot tech support to deal with a problem at work today and spoke with a great tech who works from home in Ireland. Mentioned that I saw the lockdown protests going on in Ireland and got on to talking about how anti lockdown we both are and anti covid vaccine we are.. commiseration with someone in a more despotic country seemed to really brighten his day. Just thought some good news was welcome.</p></p>

        <p>That must have lifted your spirits. My husband told me I sounded miserable and angry when I was begging him to understand the futility of the pcr test as a diagnostic tool for infectious disease. I wish I could talk to your tech support guy in Ireland too...  I could use some likeminded  conversation.</p>
