    <strong>With this, any dictatorship could just release coronavirus upon their takeover and they would have a excuse for their rights violations</strong>
    <p><p>The nazis might think that if just Hitler had a sample back then. Then taking full government power would have been much much more easy. Maybe ISIS could spread that too. That way they don't even have to provocate people when they forbid liquor and parties. Then they could seem like the moderate choice and just use corona as a excuse.</p>
<p>IF A DICTATORSHIP ENACTING CURFEW AT 9 PM ISNT OKAY THEN NEITHER IS A DEMOCRAZY</p>
<p>So so easy for any evil government to enact their rules with this. Actually if Trump was full pro restrictions that would probably have been the best, since then the democrats would have been screaming and realising how bad giving our governments so much powers is.</p>
<p>What we might just need is for Russia to use corona as a excuse. Or a western country to go full dictatorship. That might make people realize how bad this is before becomes too late.</p></p>
