    <strong>What “new normal” aspect do you worry the most won’t go away?</strong>
    <p><p>-I see a push more towards “virtual” this and “contactless” that. Because now some people are apparently so afraid to ever leave their home again or see another human over “my health and safety.” I feel concerned about this because not everyone is so afraid of the virus that they need to avoid even short contact periods with people at all costs. And we’re probably all going to see our social skills decline anyway because of all the things that are becoming forbidden or allowed (Zoom meetings instead of in-person meetups, order from an app so you don’t have to talk to your server, check out of a hotel by an app so you don’t have to go to a front desk). </p>
<p>-I’m also not a fan of these expanded health screenings in some places unless it’s a medical practice. I don’t think a restaurant hostess/otherwise untrained employee should have the right to take customers’ temperatures or ask questions about your health and who you’ve been exposed to before you eat, or a salon should do that before a haircut. It’s really invasive. I feel like there should be a limit to what a private business can do. </p>
<p>-Fearful people making decisions for the rest of us and pressuring politicians to cater to them. If you’re immune compromised or otherwise worried about germs, then you need to be responsible for your own health and decide what activities you feel comfortable doing. Don’t tell me I can’t go to a packed baseball stadium just because you don’t feel safe being there. We no longer trust people to make their own decisions or have the freedom to choose where they want to go, and I worry that will continue (with things like keeping restaurants at half capacity, social distancing everywhere) rather than being honest that social distancing shouldn’t be the default everywhere and won’t be and you need to decide if you want to take the risk. Enough of this “You don’t have the right to infect me!” crying. If you’re not at a concert and I don’t see you for two weeks or longer, then how can I infect you? You can’t assure the world is always going to be 100% safe and you’ll never get sick again.</p>
<p>-Mask wearing. As states go through reopening phases, get rid of the mandates that every citizen needs to wear one everywhere, especially outdoors.</p></p>

        <p>This isn't new, sadly. The media's been labeling everyone they don't like as "far right" or "white nationalist" for a couple years now. The SPLC, who the media cites as an arbiter of who is a "hate group", put Maajid Nawaz on a list of "anti-Islam extremists" for being too liberal a Muslim. Everything and anything is "problematic" - unless it helps Silicon Valley make even more money. This is just the latest evolution of that trend.</p>

        <p>Neurosis generally, but more precisely -</p>
<p>- Compulsive sanitisation of everything.</p>
<p>- Instilling germophobia in young children.</p>
<p>- Instilling in people the fear of other people as walking contagions.</p>
<p>- Businesss and people's dreams failing due to the negative impact of social distancing. The negative financial impact of decreased footfall on income.</p>
<p>- Social anxiety, rather than a symptom of mental illness, becomes a "healthy" and positive sign of compassion and conscientiousness.</p>
<p>- Decrease in the freedom of physical closeness and human contact and touch, and the resulting negative impact on health.</p>
<p>- We generally become fearful of ourselves and each other.</p>
<p>- Government-enforced restrictions on freedom. The surrendering of individual personal rights. Information being exploited for profit / control / power under the disguise of "safety" when the intentions are much, much darker.</p>
<p>- The lasting preservation of that extent of governmental control over people long, long after the pandemic.</p>

        <p>The glass shields at the grocery store I go to are like a tall piece of plexiglass. May as well have nothing there because I still have to place my stuff on the conveyor belt and the cashier has to touch the stuff I just touched and then when I’m done I have to come around to grab my own bagged groceries. </p>
<p>I went with my mom to pick up pizza the other night and they had plexiglass all around the pickup counter. It seemed so excessive. I’d expect that in my doctor’s office or a bank.</p>

        <p>I'm scared of never finding romantic love or real friendship again. Of never having a family of my own, because socializing is discouraged, and unfortunately, I wasn't lucky enough to have found someone by now. I'm scared of having even less social interaction than before. I've been lonely and anxious for a long time even before this nightmare started. I'm scared it's now going to be permanent. I'm on the verge of tears so often now. I feel like my life has ended before it even really started. I have nightmares at night because I'm scared of the future. I don't want to die alone. My only hope comes from the fact that here in Europe, it seems like people mostly want to live life again and aren't <em>as</em> insane about "the rules" as Americans.</p>
<p>The 1984 atmosphere also scares me to death. It's quite obvious something bad is going on behind the scenes (hope you guys don't dismiss me as mentally deranged for saying that), and being powerless against whatever is going to happen next makes everything so much worse. Even my landlord, a 70+ year old retired professor, who is generally level headed, serious, and follows social etiquette etc., is very suspicious of all those authoritarian measures and feels upset about the fact society has just accepted them without questioning anything. He sent a long email to everyone he knows, basically asking them to listen to facts instead of the hysteria.</p>
<p>My former internet friends officially decided I'm a racist Nazi and a selfish heartless bitch for being</p>
<ol>
<li>Against the lockdown and extreme distancing measures</li>
<li>Against the violence and the destruction going on in American cities</li>
</ol>
<p>And pointing out having the two opposite positions <em>together</em> (viciously attacking people who disagree with the extreme measures of distancing and lockdown and want to socialize again, but supporting violent demonstrations with thousands of people) is hypocrisy of the highest degree. I feel like so many previously intelligent, logical people have lost their minds.</p>

        <p>My heart goes out to you. This is all very scary for the (evidently) few of us who can think critically. It appears that most people either fall very easily to mob mentality or are indifferent and easily herded. I was fortunate to meet my bf before this all began and I’m so grateful everyday. However, I too feel like my life ended before it began. I was terribly lonely for long before. Finally there was some hope of a future but now that’s been torn away. I’m scared to have children for many reasons. It feels that they’re turning this into some sort of slave world, where they’re killing the middle class off right before us. Maybe that’s too far out and conspiratorial for some people here, I don’t know. I just can’t help but think there’s something very very nefarious at play right now. It makes me scared to bring children into a world that looks like this forever.</p>

        <p>Catering to the weak and fearful was a trend before COVID.  The lockdowns were the peak of that trend.</p>
<p>Society used to drag the weak and scared along with us.  Can't run a mile in gym?  Better learn how.  Afraid to live on your own?  Mom and Dad want you out after high school/college.  We built stronger, braver people.</p>
<p>Social media gave disproportionate voice to the weaklings and the fearful.  They were allowed to control narratives and shifted values from rewarding results to rewarding motivations.  Why?  Because scared, weak people can't get results...but they mean well.</p>
<p>Lockdowns were peak virtue signaling.  They <em>meant</em> well initially, the results just sucked.  Those of us who argued <em>results</em> were called heartless, just like the coaches, commanders, and corporate leaders who didn't let the mob of woke children run things in years past.</p>
<p>I think the pendulum will swing the other way now, but I'm afraid it might not.</p>

        <p>What’s crazy to me is that it’s so possible for there to be middle ground. We can definitely have protections for people who are truly vulnerable (not just in the context of a virus, but just in general), while still encouraging people to live their lives and strive for improvement where possible <em>and</em> without taking the protections for the vulnerable to such an extent that it harms those who aren’t vulnerable. I don’t know why everything has to be taken to such an extreme.</p>

        <p>"Virtual" and "contactless", I see that people will generally become more anti social whether they realize it or not because they see no need to go outside anymore, and tech can somewhat replace human interaction which didn't exist in previous pandemics. Health screenings before entering businesses is scary if it becomes pernament. Not too sure if it's going to become pernament, unless it becomes a law or something like that, but even then I'm a little doubtful. Face masks, I'm scared for blue states, red states not so much, their attitudes currently are much more lax over face masks.</p>

<p>My kid had a pressing medical issue 2 months ago. She should have absolutely been seen by her doctor in person. He even said so, but refused to make an exception for her. Some things are fine over the phone, but not when you should be physically seeing the person to determine the severity.</p>

        <p>Virtual and contactless shit. And theme parks with masks and social distancing guidelines. Oh, and most prominently never finding a relationship and a family because everybody is so fucking pissed-pants afraid of this goddamn thing and would rather long-distance marriages be a thing now.</p>
<p>The guidelines for social distancing are bullshit and useless anyway, but the fact that they exist still gives me a fucking headache</p>

        <p>Fear and paranoia.</p>
<p>I live in Ottawa, Canada's national capital, one of the most anti-risk cities anywhere and the only one on Canada to make masks on public transit mandatory. We fence in pedestrian bridges because someone might fall or jump.  We fence in the entire LRT line for the same reasons.  The minute someone slips a but on a icy sidewalk (usually wearing shows, not boots!!!) we dump a whole truckload of salt on it. </p>
<p>I don't think the fear mindset will go away, and I think it will more and more intrude on people's lives and civil liberties.  You will be an outcast of you don't follow along blindly.</p>

        <p>You can only keep fear up for so long in the absence of anything tangible to fear . Since March I have been on transit once or twice a week; have worked from the office once or twice per week with clients (social service agency); have done our normal shopping, and have had some social time with friends. </p>
<p>No one close to me has had COVID-19, or at least not enought to be ill.  They only people I know anecdotally to have tested positive were not sick at all. </p>
<p>I'm not saying the virus doesn't exist, and I know poeple have died--mostly the very old or very sick.  For most people this is a non-issue.</p>

        <p>I can just echo everything you've said.</p>
<p>I am also very worried about the "new normal" school situation for my niece and nephew, who are 7 and 13. I am also worried about the impact that this has had on my sister, who deals with depression and anxiety on a GOOD day. This whole lockdown thing has taken a huge toll on her. The kids are paying the price. It just cannot go on.</p>
<p>I'm worried about contact tracing. In Ohio, the health department supposedly hired close to a thousand people, and then they abruptly stopped talking about it. This worries me greatly. I don't trust the situation at ALL. The silence is conspicuous.</p>
<p>It really feels like the walls of surveillance are closing in. I mean, our lack of privacy was already a joke. But now?</p>

All this fear has provided cover to continue living in lame ass suburban shitholes that are unsustainable especially due to the fear about density and the subway pumped out by the media.

        <p>And cities are sustainable and not shitholes? LOL if anything 2020 has convinced me that cities are death traps...fine to visit and have fun in, but nowhere I want to live...ALL this shit, riots and lockdowns alike, was worse in cities, they are tempting targets for attack, they are more expensive and while I don’t hate all people it is nice to be able to not be entirely surrounded by all their noise all the time and not to need roommates</p>

        <p>Suburbs rely on the government by socializing their infrastructure cost (roads and pipes below them) to the government all so people can have oversized houses. That’s why they’re not sustainable in the long run and America’s infrastructure is crumbling.</p>

        <p>And cities don’t produce their own food 🤷🏻‍♀️ The trucks stop running, city people are eating each other within a week. While I don’t want or need a McMansion, I am also not about to pay huge amounts of money to live in a closet or have to have roommates, the whole point of doing the thing where I work for a living is having somewhere quiet and nice to live and get a break from other people and their noise...not everyone WANTS to live in a city, not everyone should have to...also, as far as relying on government and putting up with more government involvement in daily life, cities win that one running...no thanks</p>

Large cities have worse air quality, there are a LOT of people who won’t live in an ultra dense death trap with shitty air quality, more government control over daily life surrounded by noise and people everywhere.

        <p>Central Florida, about 30-45 minutes away from Tampa, smaller town. It has the benefit of being close enough to Tampa for work purposes or if I want to hit up Ybor and far enough away that stricter lockdown measures, curfews and riots didn’t hit us. </p>
<p>Also smaller towns have fun stuff to do downtown also, it is a few miles away but have walked home on nice nights, so I get to bar hop, see friends and not risk a DUI. </p>
<p>Because not everywhere is the same, not everything is either mega city, suburb or farmland, there is other stuff to that doesn’t suck isn’t boring and has enough space so everyone is not on top of each other and doesn’t need top down authoritarian micromanaging at the first hint of trouble.

        <p>Excessive authoritarianism by government. Keep in mind this should be an issue for both the left and the right. Police brutality is made far worse by “broken windows policing” which is what lockdowns basically mandate. </p>
<p>Also on a personal level, I have allergy issues and am concerned that I will always be at risk of being barred from places because of my allergy symptoms.</p>

        <p>There is a laundry list of things. But something I didn't see someone mention that the amount of disposable items we are using has increased. Restaurants that were exclusively doing carry out during lockdown followed by some places continuing to use single use when partially opened. I felt that was something as a society we were moving away from and now have no choice. Even the reusable shopping bags aren't allowed at one point (this one might be more relaxed now).</p>

        <p>Further proof that liberalism is a mental disorder:</p>
<p>-You must bring your own reusable bags to the grocery store as plastic bags are bad for the environment. Now, reusable bags are "unsanitary" so we must revert to plastic.</p>
<p>-You must wear a mask and social distance to avoid spreading the Rona. Unless it's to protest police brutality, then it's A-OK. It's also not OK to protest against the lockdowns or against the government generally. That's White Nationalist Nazi Terrorism (TM).</p>
<p>-We need to do more to help low-income people and minorities. Except re-open the economy, the closure of which has disproportionately affected the working class and non-whites.</p>

        <p>Closures of public land and parks, and the fact that you can get shamed publicly on social media if you decide to engage in any form of outdoor recreation, even a solo hike in the wilderness, which forces many indoors. This is so detrimental to our health in more ways than I can count.</p>
