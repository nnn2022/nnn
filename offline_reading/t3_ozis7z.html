        <p>Who is anyone on Reddit, to be able to dictate what subreddits that a user is or is not, able to participate in. If that has to be a condition of staying apart of or participating in a subreddit, then that subreddit community is nothing but the antithesis of one of the primary goals of Reddit. Reddit communities have always existed to openly allow visitors to the platform the ability to participate and contribute to communities of people with whom they share a common interest, without the worries of having their interests limited and dictated by others. When a user's interests are limited and dictated by others, it ruins the ability of Reddit to allow anyone to maintain a sense of belonging somewhere with like-minded people, where free speech can be exercised as much for any topic, as long as the community follows the site-wide rules.</p>
<p>No one should have their subreddit interests limited, based upon one's interests within another community. Those who seek to do this, are the ones who'll eventually ruin Reddit's future, and then we'll be asking ourselves, "Who or what killed Reddit?" The answer for that question, is already happening right now, slowly building as a result of these petty bans. If the Administrators are worried about this doomsday scenario being realized, then it would be wise for them to take action by creating a site-wide rule that prohibits the arbitrary banning of users from communities, based upon a user's participation in another community of which a moderator may not agree with the ideas of.</p>
