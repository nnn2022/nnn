    <strong>Hello, I had a question regarding change</strong>
    <p><p>So I went to a protest today, it was really nice talking to like minded people. It feels good to know others are out there and I feel less alone. As I was telling my fiance about the event, he questioned the need for protests. Before we eye roll that statement, hear him out. His point of view is that they are screwing us and will continue to do so as long as they can keep their power through media and social brainwashing tactics. Which they've done incredibly well tbh. That meeting up and marching isn't going to stop them from executing their plan, as it is in motion and the majority have eaten it up. He believes that full on lynching, molotovs into parliament, leaders in a stockade with their nuts in a vice and a pen signing our freedoms back kind of protesting. That things wont change unless we force them.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that people are very scared and fighting is something they aren't willing to do. I have a friend who was vaccinated on the premise that, 'well they're already poisoning our food, water and air, what's a bit more' this is what she told me. I know 3 people in my life that would be willing to stand for this, actually fight for this. But everyone else stays passive and afraid, not knowing why they are doing the things they are doing. Yet finding tiktoks and media to validate their choices. Maybe it's just where I live, but people are passive, isolating, unfriendly, cold and shut down. Its damn weird.</p>
<p>I guess my questions are: do protests do anything real in this day and age? Will the powers that be really stop their plan when they have the majority eating out of their palm? What is the second step of protesting to bring about genuine change? Does a countries people have a chance at starting or joining in revolution of state if their people are so passive? What can we do to stop them from playing the same game a year or two with a different narrative? The global system has to fall but how do you reach the spider in the massive web that its built? </p>
<p>I just genuinely asking, please dont berate me for certain points of views, I'd love to have this discussion because I think we are at the cusp, and we can regress back into the NWOs simmering pot.</p></p>
