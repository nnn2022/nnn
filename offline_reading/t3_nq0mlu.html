        <p>What are the PROVEN effects? Please let me know.  Im looking at cdc and fda and neither one of them will approve it.</p>
<p>Airlines are now considering not letting vaccinated people fly due to blod clots happening so frequently and flying perpetuates it. </p>
<p>Why won't insurance companies cover anyone who dies or has adverse effects?  For example:  why would a single healthy young mother take the chance of getting vaccinated and dying from the vaccine that her health or life insurance will not cover, if any complications arise.  However, if complications from covid arise, the .03 chance of it happening, she is covered and her children are taken care of financially if something happens.</p>

        <p>https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/moderna-covid-19-vaccine</p>
<p>On December 18, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the second vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The emergency use authorization allows the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S for use in individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>
<p>Emergency use authorization is not FDA approved.  </p>
<p>Good night, keep being brainwashed by the cdc and Bill gates whose number one mission is population control.<br>
Let me know how you feel in 10 years...</p>

        <p>&rt;I got banned for making that comment so maybe this will reach you but maybe not. It has 90% efficacy.</p>
<p>1) i don't really believe your efficacy claims. </p>
<p>2) even if your efficacy claims were true, i'm still not interested in taking COVID vaccines. </p>
<p>&rt;The moderna,niaid is approved by the FDA and recommended by the CDC for americans. </p>
<p>you need to understand that the CDC has  a very long history of LYING to protect the "vaccines are safe and effective" narrative. </p>
<p>for example, the current COVID vaccines are killing more people than all other vaccines combined, </p>
<p>so WHY has the CDC not done anything abbot that? </p>
<p>its because your death is a risk the CDC is willing to take. </p>
<p>&rt;I don't dispute that there are adverse reactions in some people. </p>
<p>1 in 68 kids is now autistic because of vaccines. </p>
<p>ill bet you dispute that! </p>
<p>&rt;With over 150 million people getting a shot I'm sure it has happened. </p>
<p>yep, vaccines really have caused autism. </p>
<p>you can hear their stories at /r/HearThisWell </p>
<p>&rt;My frustration comes from family members dying straight up from covid. </p>
<p>why is that frustrating? people die every day. </p>
<p>&rt;With the vaccine it is mostly preventable.</p>
<p>says who? the vaccine quacks who want to sell more vaccines? </p>
<p>why did cases of COVID go up in India, right when the so-called vaccine got rolled out?</p>
<p>&rt;I just will never comprehend why people wouldn't protect themselves and their family members from a potentially long-term disabling event and potentially fatal event. </p>
<p>i plan on protecting myself from a potentially long-term disabling event and/or potentially fatal event, by NOT taking the vaccine.  </p>
<p>&rt;Having a family member in a coma with a tube down their neck for 4 months then unable to close their throat because the tube was in so long. </p>
<p>I'm sorry your local doctors are quacks who think putting people on a vent is the best way to help, when in fact, putting people on a vent is the best way to insure that they die. </p>
<p>which is why, if you had been paying attention, everyone was saying to never let them put your family member on a vent, or else they will die. </p>
<p>&rt;Yes he survived but when he pours a drink in his mouth it goes straight into his lungs. It's a catastrophe. I would do anything to prevent that from happening to anyone else.</p>
<p>you should be directing your anger at Dr Fauci, who literally funded the development of this so-called COVID virus</p>
<p>&rt;I didn't realize when I had initially posted it was on a sub dedicated to anti-vax. I was sorting by new. In retrospect I don't feel like I will change any minds in what seems to be a circle of affirmation. I bid you a good night.</p>
<p>"circle of affirmation": vaccines are safe and effective, because the guy who sells me vaccines says vaccines are safe and effective, and the guy who sell him the vaccines, also says they are safe and effective... </p>
<p>at what point have you ever allowed dissenting opinions to enter your inner dialog?</p>

        <p>&rt;Adverse reactions to any vaccine are extremely rare. </p>
<p>pseudoscience: ballpark measurements. </p>
<p>&rt;I would rather err on the side of the CDC then err on the side of Wanda on her organic Facebook page.</p>
<p>really? why? </p>
<p>theres literally no reason to believe anything the CDC says about anything at all. </p>
<p>&rt;Attempts to disagree and fight the PROVEN effects of the vaccine</p>
<p>"proven effects" like... the man-made epidemic of /r/VaccineHomicide ?</p>
<p>&rt;only perpetuate the inconveniences we've had to endure for the last 15 months.</p>
<p>"inconveniences" that the vaccine quacks are 100% responsible for. </p>
<p>&rt;It's like the commercial where 9 out of 10 dentist agree on something and one jerk thinks he knows something secret that nobody else knows. It just looks foolish. That is all.</p>
<p>wow you are really stupid! nobody ever told you that those commercials are designed to manipulate you into buying some crap that you wouldn't have otherwise bought?</p>
<p>but keep telling yourself how smart you are... it seems to have gotten you this far in life...</p>
