    <strong>I believe that America is gearing up for their own version of the Tianamen Square Massacre. And it will be framed as a super spreader event experiencing a new aggressive COVID mutation.</strong>
    <p><p>Get this: military is being deployed into key points around the country as we speak. It's been happening for months. On Christmas day an RV was detonated in front of an AT&amp;T building. The day after a train carrying crude oil was derailed causing a half-miler radius evacuation.</p>
<p>The one behind the blast, Anthony Q Warner, has been given the silent treatment by the media. They've made him out to be a cartoon villain straight from a QAnon meme.</p>
<p>My theory is that they were both tests to see how long they could shut communications and force onlookers away from the area. </p>
<p>The COVID narrative is dying. What better way to revive it than to kill hundreds of people at once, preferably at a protest, then blame their non-compliance for their deaths?</p></p>

        <p>The Nashville bombing, whether it's a set up or not, is being used to further crack down on "dangerous conspiracy theorists". For whatever reason, the elites don't want anyone to question the safety or intent of 5g tech.</p>
