    <strong>A Topic Discussed in the Video Proofed to be Real a Few Minutes Later</strong>
    <p><p>Today, I posted on my FB page <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdzW-S8MwbI">this</a> video about mass psychosis. In short, it's about blinding trust in leaders and their propaganda. The only reaction I was given was a single comment pointing on the website, which shared the video with Czech subtitles. There was nothing related to the content of the video, just some hate that the website spreads false information, etc. The friend who wrote it just copy-pasted some bullshit from fact-cheching websites funded by our "trustful" government. And that's it. He did not discussed the topic, nor he expressed his original opinion. The comment was liked by another two friends. I bet not one of them have watched the video (it's too long for them).</p>
<p>Actually, I am glad this is happening. Sheep are getting nervous and kick everywhere they can to gain an ego boost. They make it is easier to reveal their true selves.</p>

<p>If you speak Czech, <a href="https://otevrisvoumysl.cz/jak-se-tvori-masova-psychoza-muze-se-zdravy-rozum-vratit-do-sileneho-sveta/">this</a> is the website.</p></p>

        <p>Maybe, I was a little too sarcastic. We are still in a partial lockdown in the Czech Republic, dating now happens only on apps, I guess. Nevertheless, more than 70% of our girls wear masks even outside, so yeah. :D</p>
