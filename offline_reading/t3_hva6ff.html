        <p>Mandatory vaccines are the next step or one of the next steps. The lockdowns were all about compliance. Masks were all about compliance. They will keep going until enough people finally say they have had enough like in Serbia.</p>
<p>Half of people don't get the flu vaccine each year, and of those who do, it is ineffective in half of them. I imagine there will be large scale compliance, but they can choose any arbitrary metric to say it is insufficient.</p>

        <p>I figured, and thus why I was so terrified in March when lockdowns were proposed. I <strong>knew</strong> people would buy into it, and that it would then be difficult to come out of the lockdowns and restrictions. Looks like I was right.</p>

        <p>I also had a feeling this would've happened, but I wanted to remain optimistic and think "there's no way people will roll over so easily." Boy was I dead wrong. This situation turned out a lot worse than I could've ever expected</p>

        <p>So galling that they want to push an experimental rushed vaccine on 100% of humanity. Like, where is the control population? It's such a gamble to put all the humans in one basket, especially for something that is in no way an existential threat. Worse still if the vaccine is required 4 times a year. Damn that's a lot of money and control.</p>

        <p>Ugh I knew it. I remember a few months back when this lockdown first started, I had a long conversation with my mom who was very anxious about not being able to travel as freely if the vaccine came out and that they would make people prove they were vaccinated in order to have certain freedoms. She tends to be anxious by nature, so at the time I had tried to reassure her. I’ll have to check in on her to see how she is doing with this news and to let her know I appreciate her foresight. She’s never had a lot of faith in the government.</p>

        <p>Here we go.</p>
<p>From article:</p>
<p>&rt; “Vaccination has had a massively positive benefit to society and if we get large numbers of people vaccinated then the restrictions we are all currently facing will stop and we will return to normal.</p>
<p>&rt; “But conversely, if large numbers of people of the right cohort, those who are at most at risk of COVID infection, do not get vaccinated, then the restrictions will have to remain and we will not be returning to normal until the vaccination is in place.”</p>

        <p>Oh, I'm sure many, <em>many</em> people will comply with the vaccine demands without the government needing to mandate it.</p>
<p>However, they are going to go for 100% compliance. Mark my words. The masks were a precursor to the vaccines. Soon we will get people attacking others for not vaccinating, "JUST GET THE VACCINE, YOU ASSHOLE".</p>

        <p>&rt; Aren't most vaccines harmless, though? </p>
<p>You think a vaccine that has been developed in "warpspeed" (this will be the fastest vaccine ever made, whereas the one before this took four years to create, test, and distribute), that has bypassed several key testing phases, and has now been said to give 70% of its participants fevers and headaches as side effects (God knows what other side effects it has, they haven't fucking tested it for longterm effects or anything aside from the short term) is completely harmless? Not to mention that they creepily continue to imply they want to make it mandatory. In case you don't know, body autonomy <strong>is</strong> important. We should make our own decisions on what we put in our bodies. Yes "My Body, My Choice", and I don't mean this unironically. I am actually pro-choice as well. The government shouldn't ban or mandate medications or medical procedures, it should be down to the individual to decide what they want to do, and to live with the consequences of their actions.</p>

<p>I agree 100% on that one. Sadly this position will almost certainly be under fire in the same way as anyone advocating for freedom, personal agency / sovereignty, privacy, etc has been throughout this.</p>

        <p>Hey man, as I said, I'm on your side of this argument. I'm just playing devil's advocate here. Let me repeat that before I fully reply: i am fully on board with this line of thinking, as it is my own. I shan't be signing up for this vaccine any time soon, thank you very much. However, I do feel it is important for all of us to understand why some might not get out point of view.</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the devil's advocate side of the argument (and a layman at that).</p>
<p>&rt;You think a vaccine that has been developed in "warpspeed" (this will be the fastest vaccine ever made, whereas the one before this took four years to create, test, and distribute), that has bypassed several key testing phases, and has now been said to give 70% of its participants fevers and headaches as side effects (God knows what other side effects it has, they haven't fucking tested it for longterm effects or anything aside from the short term) is completely harmless?</p>
<p>Well, we get a new yearly vaccine for the flu  as it mutates fairly rapidly, so it's not like this is wholly unheard of. A headache and fever aren't exactly deadly - the virus will give about that to most people anyway, so surely if you're not worried about the virus then you shouldn't be worried about this vaccine or its side effects. And the testing phases have been run concurrently with each other  rather than one after the other as usual. Again, if you're not worried about the virus, the vaccine probably won't be any worse. </p>
<p>(Again, I don't actually think this -if we are so worried about the potential long term affects of the virus  we should also be worried about the potential long term affects of the vaccine).</p>
<p>&rt; Not to mention that they creepily continue to imply they want to make it mandatory. In case you don't know, body autonomy is important. We should make our own decisions on what we put in our bodies. Yes "My Body, My Choice", and I don't mean this unironically. </p>
<p>Yes, but others also have a right to not die from a virus that could have been spread from you onto them. </p>
<p>(Although I'd argue that the vaccine should be available only for thise at high risk, but, again, I am trying to see it from the other side)</p>

        <p>There have been a ton of vaccines in the past (especially rushed ones) that caused a lot of bad side effects. Every vaccine on the schedule now still has the rare severe side effects. I personally would rather get COVID than take a rushed vaccine. I won't be taking it or giving it to my children. </p>

        <p>No. There is no such thing as "a harmless vaccine". All vaccines have risks and fallout, yes even the ones that follow the lengthy years-long development process. Acknowledging this undeniable fact of reality does not make one "an anti-vaxxer", although you will surely hear it deliberately framed as such throughout the media / social media.</p>
<p>A good video to start with would be <a href="https://open.lbry.com/@LockdownSkepticism:f/Toronto-Board-of-Health-Motion-on-Addressing-Vaccine-Hesitancy-April-8-2019:b?r=3nwYkxMhGD8EuUJWC9afcEJphVqn5AqR">this</a> one on vaccine hesitancy.</p>
<p>Thinking vaccines are "harmless", is the same line of thinking that landed us in the mess we are in right now. Ignoring consequences of our actions benefits no one (other than those seeking to benefit or profit from whatever it is).</p>
<p>When it comes to vaccines, you may very well still be able to argue that it's a net positive when discussing them in general (that <em>doesn't</em> mean they're "harmless" to everyone). But by the same token, it's a completely reasonable and rational position to remain skeptical of the upcoming one and insist upon utmost scrutiny, not to mention the dubious nature of forcing millions (or billions) of people to take it despite all we now know. We don't force the whole world to take flu shots.</p>

        <p>Go figure. I can see the vaccine being the next virtue signal. There has already been a fair amount of hate built up towards anti-vaxxers and I think those who reject this vaccine could get lumped in the same category regardless of how they were previously. </p>
<p>With all the lockdowns, mask mandates, and snitching on those who violate restrictions and mask mandates, I think it’s extremely likely that this vaccine will be mandatory for entering most public places.</p>
<p>Also, with high compliance seen as needed for returning to normal, we’re probably going to see a lot of the same towards the vaccine and those who refuse as with masks and anti-maskers.</p>
<p>On another note, ironically we really would not be fully back to normal with a vaccine if they need to enforce a mandate. For example, if proof of immunity would be needed to attend a concert or sporting event, chances are they’d have to change the process of selling tickets.</p>
