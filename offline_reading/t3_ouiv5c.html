    <strong>I was naïve once.</strong>
    <p><p>It took being in a very controlling relationship several years ago to realize I can't blindly trust those who say they have my best interest at heart as they try to seize control of every aspect of my life.</p>
<p>"I will drive you to and from work with your car for your convenience while I run errands for you" was really "I will have control and surveillance over all of your movements while I cheat on you using your car while you're at work"</p>
<p>The more I resisted his demands the more he escalated his force on me to comply. The parallels are uncanny. That is why I value personal freedom, because there was a time where I was disillusioned to the point that I had absolutely none left and needed to fight tooth and nail to get it back for myself, even if it costed me my job (blackmail) or my physical safety.</p></p>

        <p>It's good I eventually got out but you're right I was a shell of a person towards the end. I am only making this post because this is what I am witnessing on a global scale, and know how hard it is to convince people that they are being abused, or to step out of the confines of "safety through compliance."</p>
<p>Just need to be patient with people, they will see things eventually. Things will get worse before they get better.</p>

        <p>I'm with you on this one.</p>
<p>Emotional blackmail is my childhood. I learned to never trust someone i don't know say it's for my "well being" when politicians says we're in the covid war, failing to hide their inner excitation and pleasure, you know.</p>
<p>What they're doing is SO cristal clear. That's maybe why we never hear of psychiatrists recently.</p>
<p>Sad to see so many people fall for this.</p>
