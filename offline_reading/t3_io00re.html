    <strong>My experience at the doctor. Really need some support right now.</strong>
    <p><p>Went to the doctor today to get the results back from my blood tests (not actually sick, just a checkup). The lady at the desk says I have to wear a mask. I ask if it's ok to pull my scarf over my face. It isn't, she gives me a mask. The waiting room usually has about 10 chairs in it. Today it has 3 because of distancing, but you're only allowed to have 1 person inside at a time (why bother having 3 spaced out chairs then?!), so I go to sit in the corridor outside. </p>
<p>I put the mask just over my chin. Nobody seems to mind. A few minutes go by and I'm sitting there with this ridiculous chin-cover and something just snaps inside me. I break down completely and start crying, thinking about how stupid and pointless this whole thing is, about how we're ruining life for no reason at all. I find that the mask is remarkably absorbent, so I pull it all the way up my face to soak up the tears and snot. Soon the whole thing is wet so I go and get another mask to dry my face with. </p>
<p>How is this tear-soaked, mucus-covered mask supposed to protect anybody?! Thanks to this stupid mask policy, I have now gotten snot and tears all over my hands, my face, the masks, the chair, the door handles and god knows what else. In an attempt to protect people from bodily fluids, they've caused me to spread bodily fluids EVERYWHERE. If I didn't have to wear a mask, I would have sat there peacefully the whole time. Instead I turned into a deranged dripping faucet. </p>
<p>I calm down by the time it's my turn to see the doctor, but I keep the mask pulled up so she can't see that I've been crying. She checks my weight and notes that it's down (didn't need to lose any, I'm already thin). Perhaps due to stress, she says. Perhaps you're eating less. She praises my excellent test results and books my next appointment. I hope life's back to normal for you by then, she says. We try to smile at each other through the masks. </p>
<p>I walk back to the car and spend about 15 minutes crying hysterically. Someone tell me it's going to end...just make it stop!</p></p>

        <p>I can't speak for the U.K., but as far as the U.S., you're absolutely correct.  They are just public health emergency executive orders.  No legislation has been voted on or written in the books.  Its the decision of one person, the governor of each state.    And its mainly enforced through businesses requiring it for fear of fines or closures, mostly because they know the brainwashed citizen sheepl police will report them if infractions are observed.</p>

        <p>I'm not a legal expert, but something that faces a Â£100 fine for non compliance is more than advice.  Maybe a "Regulation" rather than "law" per se but I don't know the difference.  The Uk government's own site says "there are some places where you must wear a face covering by law" and the police can in theory arrest you for it. Be that as it may, whether it's advice or law my point was about the inconsistency.</p>

        <p>So it's the law to wear one if you aren't exempt.</p>
<p>Doctors aren't giving out any kind of exemptions. So nobody has anything to show to anyone and even police officers are not entitled to your private information without a warrant. </p>
<p>That's my understanding. It's basically law unless you decide that you've had enough of this bullshit and tell everyone that you are exempt which is exactly what everyone should do right now. </p>
<p>I even told a policeman I don't have to give you any information and he left me alone. Why do people see Â£100 and just give in immediately it's so pathetic.</p>

        <p>I went for a blood test the other day and didn't wear one so I thought I'd be able to get away with it. I definitely won't be going for any more appointments though. I'll just reschedule until this is all over and if it isn't, well my results are good, I don't need to go through all this trauma just to have someone tell me to keep doing the same thing I was before.</p>

        <p>Lucky me! I donât have health insurance after I lost my job! I have a rare disease. The nurse practitioner called to schedule a check up (I see them every 6 weeks). I said âI have no health insurance and I cannot pay youâ.  That solved having to see the doctor and worry about wearing a mask. USA is great!</p>
<p>Actually, I hate being sick and I hate doctor appointments and invasive tests. It was my lifeâs goal to age gracefully without any prescriptions. Funny how life works out.</p>

The guilt of continuously lying to my doomer friends weighs me down though. I have to hide so much from them.

        <p>If your friend's don't want to be exposed to others you met at a party then you are a shitty friend for not disclosing that. It doesn't matter what you or they believe, you have no right to expose them if they don't want to be exposed. This is why I have to stay at home all the time.</p>

        <p>It doesn't make a bit of sense. I went to the immediate care today because I've been covered with poison ivy, unable to use one hand due to swelling, and have to get oral steroids. I'm behind on a lot of stuff, God damn it!</p>
<p>I had to call to be "prescreened" when I showed up. It went like this:</p>
<p>Me: I was told to call before coming in.</p>
<p>Her: Oh, right. Let's see. Do you have COVID?</p>
<p>Me: No...</p>
<p>Her: Just come on in, hon.</p>
<p>The nurse.practioner I saw was tickled to death over my single-layer cheesecloth mask. He kept chuckling over it and saying it was the best work around he had seen, because you have to get pretty close to see what it is. The receptionist commented that she wish she'd thought of it; we commiserated over fogging glasses, and then I went to the pharmacy where every pharmacy tech had the mask down below the nose, and one had it off.</p>
<p>I hate having to wear one for healthcare, but I couldn't wait. And it was nice knowing that there others out there who know this is some bullshit.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry you felt like this. I did plenty of crying back in March and April. When it first started I saw an old lady in a mask drop a bunch of stuff and I had to stop myself from helping her. I wasn't sure she would want the help--what if she thought I would give her the disease and got upset? So I just stood there in line at the grocery and cried to myself because I felt like a piece of shit for not helping, and then felt worse because society at large was telling me that being unkind and unhelpful is the REAL kindness. It's upside-down world out there.</p>
<p>I hope your next visit is one done in freedom, not like this. Enough is enough.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing, I got a laugh off your description of the phone call! :) Going to the doctor used to be such a positive, empowering, enjoyable experience for me. I remember I was there a couple of years ago, and another patient walks out of the doctor's office and announces to all of us in the waiting room, "the doc says my cholesterol is down! I'm allowed to eat deli meat!" and we're all smiling and laughing. Couldn't have happened today. The doctor herself is a very nice person and has gone out of her way to help me over the years. She was her usual friendly self today but of course they have to follow the rules (or risk getting shut down), and that just kills the atmosphere.</p>

        <p>I used to work for a public service where I used to live, and had dozens of regular visitors. Elderly people who came in every week to get one little thing done or ask a question, but who really wanted to talk to one of us for a while, because they were lonely or didn't have enough people in their lives to talk with. There was an old retired marine who came to talk to me for hours about twice a month. I knew more about him than I did my own family. I hope he has someone to talk to now.</p>
<p>I really worry about what has been going on with people like that for the last six months. A lot.</p>
<p>Keep offering to help the old aunties--maybe one day they'll want the help.</p>

        <p>Yes I worry too. I do keep asking but especially since I don't ever wear a mask, it's getting more difficult to even talk to anyone. People have been scared shitless of this thing and it's not getting any better. This will become the new normal if we don't keep rocking the boat and telling fellow skeptics that it's not acceptable to just wear your mask and not say anything. </p>
<p>Our future freedom hinges on right now and how many people make a fuss. I'm fed up with seeing and hearing about people not doing their bit.</p>

        <p>The doctors need to stop with this shit.  They know itâs bullshit.  They never made anyone wear masks before.  The flu and all sorts of contagious shit has been going around fir centuries and they never made anyone wear masks.  Why?  Because a mask doesnât stop germs from spreading.  They know it.  Otherwise, why wouldnât they have been making you wear a mask when you were sick before, especially when they have no idea what you have when you walk in.  Because itâs bullshit and they know it.  Theyâre afraid to say it maybe?  The dumb ass governors and liberal twats have people afraid to be shamed I guess.  Doctors know this is all bullshit.</p>

        <p>Exactly! And the doctor is a specialist who sees people with chronic conditions - so they KNOW what's wrong with me and all the other patients, we come along every few months for our checkups. In all the years I've been to this doctor, I've never seen another patient visibly ill, because this isn't the doctor you go to for things like that.</p>

<p>I just always refuse to wear one. I wish people would stop giving in.</p>
<p>Nobody has an answer for why they tape stuff off. "This door is not in use" it's not broken, it's just been taped off BeCaUSe C*rOnA. Nobody can answer for me who this helps. It means more people have to cram through small spaces and touch the same things. It means that we never get to forget this is a new normal.</p>
<p>When I ask managers, they tell me that these are government regulations that they had to follow to open up again.</p>
<p>The ONLY reason for this arbitrary tape that you see everywhere is to brainwash people into getting used to the new normal. I can't think of anything else.</p>
<p>Yet people are still asleep to this because it's too stressful to open your eyes and realise that governments don't have our best interests at heart. </p>
<p>When did we all get so pathetic? I think it happened slowly over the last 20 years since 9/11. Wake the fuck up they are making our lives sterile and empty and people are happy about it I'm going to start shouting at people in the street soon.</p>

        <p>That is exactly it. It's the same thing outside in the streets. Sections of the street blocked off, stickers/signs everywhere, lowered speed limits (?!?), on and on and on. Even in random parks that are never crowded.</p>
<p>You just cannot argue any rational logical basis for all of these things. They don't make sense according to the story as presented. They make sense only if the actual goal is something other than stated. Like social re-engineering, conditioning the people to accept the great reset, etc.</p>

        <p>Yes, these rules just don't make sense. Like when I went in to see the doctor, she needed to log into my account on her computer to see some of my results. Normally she gives me the keyboard to type in my details myself, but that was apparently unsafe so she just asked me my password instead. I told her but she didn't hear me properly through the mask, so she typed the wrong thing. Very frustrating for both of us so in the end she just gave me the keyboard anyway. What was the point?!</p>
<p>I totally agree with you that people should stop giving in. I did refuse at first but got bullied into it, it was just all too much to cope with. I'm not going back until they stop being stupid.</p>

        <p>FIL is having surgery this morning.  MIL is being held prisoner at the hospital because if she leaves she will become contaminated with the covid and will be unable to return.  Never mind she wasn't even tested prior to surgery (FIL was, tested negative surprisingly), so they have no idea if she's a walking petri dish or not.  It's just how things are done now.</p>
