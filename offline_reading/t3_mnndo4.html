    <p><p>‚ÄúTrump wants to lift the lockdowns so he can make money!!!‚Äù üò≠ü§¨</p>
<p>They try to act like only wealthy people want lockdowns lifted. </p>
<p>In reality lockdowns are much more destructive to those living under the poverty line. </p>
<p>Yes, it would be great if the 1% wanted to flip the bill. But they aren‚Äôt. The 1% have always been good at passing profit losses down to the lowest person on the totem pole. Tax them? They just raise the price or take it out of their workers pay. </p>
<p>We cannot keep throwing people off the ship and complain that their is no net or talk about a hypothetical net. There is no net! That is the current reality.</p>
<p>But let‚Äôs be real. They want to think it hurts bad peoples so they can feel good about it.</p></p>

        <p>They're under the mistaken assumption that keeping the economy running is tantamount to keeping the stock market running. Little do they realize that while the economy has suffered, lots of people have made a killing on the stock market in the past year.</p>

        <p>And when you go bankrupt guess who's got the money to buy low and expand their market share? Yup, but people can't understand that a small company can't sustain months or years of lockdown but corporations can, especially when they are in bed with gov and get bailed out.</p>

        <p>Yea seeing as how gig economy rendered me unqualified for unemployment.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt understand why millennials seem to mostly support the lockdowns. It hurts us the most and benefit us the least. </p>
<p>Everyone is so quick to pawn everything that we built against the odds. </p>
<p>But maybe a lot of millennials oppose it we just can hear them because they are being silenced. </p>
<p>We have to silence the real victims and than play the victim ourself. Yell over their cries. Even paint them as the villain. </p>
<p>Wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúone life is too many‚Äù when we needed housing or healthcare. Society wasn‚Äôt so willing to bend it self so completely or even lift a finger.</p>

        <p>IMO they don't understand economics at all. Most are not entrepreneurs they either work from home for a company or for the government. Some go as far as to say that we should just give people money until it's over, not understanding that if you increase the supply of money while you disrupt production it's only going to cause inflation, if you even have any products left to buy.</p>

<p>That being said yes reddit is not the whole of society, this is more like an eco chamber.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns are good for the 1%. Kills small businesses so everyone has no choice but to order from amazon and buy food from chains that can afford all the shutdowns and useless hygiene theater.</p>
