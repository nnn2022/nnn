    <strong>How do you plan on making a living/going back to normal life in the inevitable "new normal" world?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Curious as to how you, your family, like-minded friends and peers, etc., plan on making a living and going back to pre-covid, in this changing world?</p>
<p>To be more specific:- what if your job/industry requires the jab? and future subsequent jabs?- what if your kids need jabbing to attend school?  What if mundane daily tasks like food shopping, public transport, clothes shopping, etc requires certain accommodations?- what if social activities you previously enjoyed like concerts, cinemas, flights, holidays, etc require the same new accommodations?</p>
<p>Now, I know the MAIN answer to these questions is self-sufficiency. A la: work for yourself, grow your own food, home school your children, connect with like-minded neighbours to trade food/good/skills. But, a lot of us have been thrown into this "new normal" world ill-prepared. A lot of us live in urban areas (no means of growing food), some of us are young (not enough work experience to have own business, etc), and we all just want to be able to live regular lives - without the unnecessary interventions.</p>
<p>Recently came to the conclusion that in order for me to get back to my "normal life," my profession and passion, I would have to get the vaccines, and partake in behavior I no longer feel to be acceptable. So that's my job, gone. I want to stick to my guns here but it is a bit difficult when you're put to the test. </p>
<p>Anybody out there with some wisdom pertaining to the young, ill-prepared people trying to stick to our convictions whilst trying to survive?</p>
<p>Thanks all</p></p>

        <p>I understand that mindset. </p>
<p>Practically, however, when push comes to shov, what systems will you PERSONALLY employ in order to free yourself of any reliance on the "system" ? </p>
<p>Do you have food and water supplies? Means of power generation? Farm land? Dare I say, weapons and the proficiency to use them non-chanlantly? </p>
<p>That's obviously going in the extreme end.</p>
<p>But, in the  short-term future, how will we pay the bills? If every job your skilled/trained to do requires conformity. </p>
<p>A lot of people talk the talk. But, when faced with the grin reality, many will fold.</p>

        <p>Yes, we are in fact completely self sufficient and able to operate at 100% capacity off grid.  That's a means that not everyone has but it was important to me from a young age so yes, we can walk-the-walk.</p>

        <p>I don't know man, the first thing I'd say is learn to grow and hunt for your own food.  Move to an area that has a population with a similar mindset.  </p>
<p>At the very least move to where you aren't on city-water or sewer anymore, that's half the battle.  Then get a generator with enough wattage to start your well pump.  At that point you'll have water, sewer and electric taken care of.  We pull internet directly from the cell towers so we have internet, water, sewer and electric all with the flip of a switch.  </p>
<p>We live in the forest and so have a theoretical endless supply of food.  We live day-to-day dependent on the local electric company and grocery store but if both of those disappeared tomorrow it would take very little adjustment to live exactly the same life we live today.  We are both at least partially self employed with multiple sources of income and no debt.  I could build or repair any item that we own including vehicles or anything at or around our cabin with items that I already have on hand.  </p>
<p>Join your local fire department or at least take some basic first aid courses.</p>
<p>Now, I don't live like this because of covid - I have always live like this and always will.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry to hear that. I try and keep most of my opinions on this to myself but I’m glad I have a mom who is patient and willing to listen and not judge. She wants me to get the vaccine but, like she said to me, she’s a mom and wants what she thinks is best for her family. I’m glad she only brings it up once in a while though, she’s not pushy.</p>

        <p>The ill-prepared will have to try to find better prepared family and friends to trade with—perhaps odd jobs or farm work for food and whatnot. </p>
<p>If you don’t have any well-prepared friends or family, then buy land now—and if you can’t afford it yourself, get together with a group of friends who, together, can.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the ability to buy land and supplies even amongst your friends, I won’t mince words. You have two choices at that point: get the vaccine and accept its inevitable consequences; or die of exposure, unsanitary conditions, or starvation. Basically a rock and a hard place kind of situation. The only other thing I can think of, and it’s risky, is to have a plan to “bug out” and squat somewhere where you pretty much know you won’t be disturbed.</p>

        <p>Always have a 'go' bag handy.  Clothes, medical supplies, food, weapons, etc..  I have two and while I won't divulge all the contents I can live for 90 days and defend myself quite handily.  It started in my 20's when I was clubbing all the time and would frequently find myself staying somewhere other than my place overnight.  It's just grown over time.

        <p>same as I always have.  Doing what I want and not giving a fuck.  Want me to get the jab?  Sure thing I'll fake it just like I've faked 'official' shit thousands of times in the past.  </p>
<p>Now I'm not saying that's what people should do and don't ask me how to do it.  I'm just answering the question honestly.</p>

        <p>I don't plan on participating. Our system takes from those who are productive, and gives to those who are not. It makes a lot more sense just to get a tent and join the masses of homeless. Rent is outrageous and only going up, and I like camping. Homeownership is out of the question. I'd rather be poor and homeless than pay into the system that did all this pandemic nonsense.</p>

<p>You sound like you would waver to keep the status quo? Don't get that. That used to be called "selling out".</p>
<p>Young people seem weak to me now, like why in the hell are you putting up with all this BS? Why aren't there college protests happening now over the forced vaxx? You are all such wimps you'll give in and line up for an experimental vaccine, for Covid something you have little risk from?</p>
<p>With jobs, if enough people said no, then the bosses would have to relent.</p>
<p>Have some integrity.</p>

        <p>Yes well the whole point of asking these questions is to come up with ways to make "non-participation" more realistic and feasible.</p>
<p>I don't think young people are weak, per say. I think that portrayal of young people in the mainstream is akin to the weak millennial. But, then again how much MSM narrative do you buy into? </p>
<p>This is part of the research, IMO. </p>
<p>Most people aren't in optimal positions of self-sufficiency. But some of us, would like to be. Hence the questions.</p>

        <p>I don't know one person whose "rebelled" against this in the under 40 crowd, maybe my circles are too liberal. I admit everyone is limited to their own experience. That said what I want to know now is if there have been any college protests against any of this that aren't being reported in the mainstream media? You are right maybe they are portraying them as weak, I know reddit is not a full sample. Economically they definitely have put the chains on.</p>

        <p>I do, sincerely, hope that 5 to 10 years down the road you don't have to eat the words 'I am vaccinated like a sane normal person'.  I wish no one ill will but I have the right to consider myself a 'sane normal person' when I look at the shot with a jaundiced eye.</p>
