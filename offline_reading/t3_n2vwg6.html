    <strong>Pfizer and FDA literally admitting that anyone who receives the experimental injection under the EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) is a lab rat/guinea pig, take your pick. If you knew it was a clinical trial, would you take it?</strong>
    <p><p>From Page 72 of this document on the FDA web site, dated December 10, 2020: https://www.fda.gov/media/144246/download</p>
<p>"Active surveillance of large numbers of individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is necessary to confirm the safety profile demonstrated in the clinical study in the short-, medium-, and long-term in a broader population studied for a longer duration as well as at-risk subpopulations, as possible (ie, people &rt;85 years of age or pregnant people). Individuals receiving vaccine under EUA provide the earliest opportunity to initiate these studies. "</p></p>

        <p>Ha! In black and white and still the prevarication... Amusing. Yeah, it doesn't mean it's "not safe", but that does not mean that it is safe, does it? Anyway, fun playing your little prevarication spin, but you're either part of it or too thick to comprehend the matter, though I rather doubt the latter. Adieu!</p>

        <p>They ran clinical trials prior to EUA approval see the pages 13-25 or so in the doc. Also, yeah I got it. There‚Äôs some possible risk of long-term effects, but the long-term effects of covid are well documented and worth avoiding imo.</p>

        <p>And the trials are continuing under the aegis of the EUA, that's what that part about it being "necessary to confirm the safety profile demonstrated in the clinical study" means. In other words, the clinical study has not been confirmed, ergo, it is ongoing under the rubric of the EUA because now they're dealing with entire populations, and have not got a clue what the effects will be. It's right there in black and white.</p>

        <p>The vaccine clinical trials were the largest in history and concluded prior to the EUA. The likelihood of there being any unknown side effects is minuscule and you‚Äôre just flat wrong that the this is a continued trial. What you‚Äôve pointed out is that the FDA continues to monitor the vaccine‚Äôs effects as it is rolled out to the population. This is because maybe for some tiny sub population somehow missed in the largest clinical trials in history, there might be a complication. So they monitor for that as they should. Read from the website below and stop saying people are lab rats. I can‚Äôt believe I live in the same country as such a smoothbrain.</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor an EUA to be issued for a vaccine, for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure quality and consistency, FDA must determine that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine. An EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine can be submitted to FDA based on a final analysis of a phase 3 clinical efficacy trial or an interim analysis of such trial, i.e., an analysis performed before the planned end of the trial once the data have met the pre-specified success criteria for the study‚Äôs primary efficacy endpoint.</p>
<p>From a safety perspective, FDA expects an EUA submission will include all safety data accumulated from phase 1 and 2 studies conducted with the vaccine, with an expectation that phase 3 data will include a median follow-up of at least 2-months (meaning that at least half of vaccine recipients in phase 3 clinical trials have at least 2 months of follow-up) after completion of the full vaccination regimen. In addition, FDA expects that an EUA request will include a phase 3 safety database of well over 3,000 vaccine recipients, representing a high proportion of participants enrolled in the phase 3 study, who have been followed for serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest for at least one month after completion of the full vaccination regimen.‚Äù</p>

        <p>When one does a study of any kind, before releasing results, it's a good idea to CONFIRM those results, isn't it? Which means what in this instance? It means they haven't got a clue. And not that it matters, they have immunity. So, you may not like the words "lab rats" but that's essentially what they are... Unfortunately. As for your cognitive capacities, it's a wonder to me you still consider yourself conscious. LMAO</p>
