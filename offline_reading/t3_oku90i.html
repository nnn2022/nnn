        <p>All corporate news outlets have been infiltrated and influenced by the cia, anyway. I believe the establishment, corporate outlets are more there to appeal to our tribal instincts to keep us at each other's throats and distracted, while also manufacturing consent with regards to government overreach.</p>

        <p>I agree, I only tune in for Carlson.  Even then, I check the sources because I'm hesitant to trust any news source, <strong>especially</strong> MSM.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, Carlson is pretty reliable, though if he says something is "stupid" or "silly" then the opposite side of MSM including the majority of Leftists who chant "fuck white men" put his words under a microscope, to find anything that might be incriminating to label him a bigot.  </p>
<p>Just like any conservative with a platform.  People willingly choose not to listen to both sides.  </p>
<p>I made the mistake of listening to conservative media and conservatives themselves for once after leaning left ever for years ever since I got into politics (which I still lean left on some issues), and forever changed how I treat media and sources, and a lot of conservative values grew onto me when I was presented with undeniable facts.</p>
<p>I wish my counterparts would be willing to listen to both sides without bias to articulate more accurate assessments.  :/</p>

        <p>The claim that COVID-19 killed around 600k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed. </p>
<p>The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does not require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The 600K figure <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">comes from the CDC</a> which states this:</p>
<p>&rt; All Deaths Involving COVID-19 [1]</p>
<p>&rt; [1] Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification</a> also states that confirmation <strong>is not required</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt; What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</p>
<p>&rt; - If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</p>
<p>&rt; - COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or <strong>is assumed to have caused or contributed to death</strong>.</p>
<p>People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, all kinds of diseases, old age, flu, accidents, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moreover, having <strong>a positive PCR test is not indicative of being infected with a virus</strong>:</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__Zx0qS7uI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=%2a%2aBirgit%2a%2a">find almost anything in anybody</a>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Study from november 2020: <a href="http://philosophers-stone.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-scam-has-been-confirmed-Dsalud-November-2020.pdf">PCR does not detect SARS-CoV-2 </a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease"</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Portuguese court has ruled that <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">the PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test</a>, and that "the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is <strong>97%</strong>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Former chief science officer for Pfizer says <a href="https://discover.hubpages.com/politics/Pfizer-Chief-Science-Officer-Second-Wave-Based-on-Fake-Data-of-False-Positives-for-New-Cases-Pandemic-is-Over">"second wave" is faked on false-positive COVID tests</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>TPTB are well aware that the PCR tests are not picking up what they should be picking up, so they need us to use them for testing as long as possible in order for these tests to inflate the numbers world-wide. These numbers are then used to "justify" the imposing of NWO restrictions which are meant to transform society as we know it.</p>

        <p>This is correct. I see a lot of people claiming that the death count isn't deaths from covid; it's deaths WITH covid. But it's actually worse than that. The U07.1 code can be applied to anyone, even if they don't have symptoms or a positive test result.</p>
<p>The CDC's own reports have said that 94% of those had other additional causes of death on the death certificate, but we still don't know what proportion of that 600,000 in which covid would have been the deciding factor in their death. Some people are going with 6% - the number that only had U07.1 as the cause of death - but it's likely that at least some of the 94% were pushed over the edge by the virus. It's also likely that some of that 6% were simply bad assumptions, and weren't related to covid either. We don't know the real number, and because of the intentionally sloppy accounting, we probably never will. But we do know it's a lot less than 600k.</p>

        <p>&rt;The U07.1 code can be applied to anyone, even if they don't have symptoms or a positive test result.</p>
<p>I think the greatest result of this was for a while we had nursing homes saying all deaths within a 2 week period after a person who has suspected systems died, were WuFlu deaths.</p>
<p>People having a cough and dying in elder care is likely more common than bears shitting in the woods.</p>
<p>Oh, and here's a good citation for your point.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death.</a></p>
<p>It should also be noted that some counties have started lowering their count.</p>
<p><a href="https://oaklandside.org/2021/06/04/alameda-countys-new-covid-death-toll-is-25-lower-than-thought/">Alameda County’s new COVID death toll is 25% lower than thought</a></p>
<p>And that this policy has been here from the start.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/feds-classify-all-coronavirus-patient-deaths-as-covid-19-deaths/">“The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,” she added.</a></p>
<p>Which is funny, doomers love to call this "outdated information" yet can never show where the policy changed. Because it hasn't.</p>

        <p>You don't think the scope of a threat has any bearing on how worried people need to be, and how justifiable the measures taken are?</p>
<p>I don't think you'd find a single person (other than those who are genuinely mentally ill) who thought we needed lockdowns during the ebola pandemic. </p>
<p>Likewise, I assume if Covid were just as infectious but had something like a 50% mortality rate that most of the people here would agree that lockdowns might be supported, and would be more likely to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Life is a series of risk assessments, so of course people shouldn't respond to differing levels of risk in the same way.</p>

        <p>Of course it's true, the tiny scale of the Ebola "pandemic" did not warrant the scare tactics used by mainstream TV media, as exemplified in OP'S cartoon. Everyone was talking about it, but no one was ever in any danger. Same with Zika.</p>
<p>So TV media outlets had overblown the severity of Ebola. What then did they do with Covid? And you say only "deranged maniacs" demanded lockdowns for Ebola, yet those very same people are heavily pushing extreme measures for Covid, while many more <em>slightly crazy</em>, and hypochondriac folk are <strong>forcing</strong> inoculations upon everyone. You say the TV media has done no harm in scaring people from Covid, but that fear played right into the ears of the loudest crazies, who are the greatest public influencers in political policy.</p>
<p>And you guessed that if Covid we worse, we would support lockdowns and vaccination. No, we would support what we always did: To bolster the immune system with sunlight, diet, exercise, and even meditation/prayer. There's a massive body of academic and anecdotal articles to support all of these points, the evidence leaks through Google's search engine.</p>
<p>But you're onto something; while we do not support government mandated measures, most of us can agree with health experts on a few things. "If you're sick, stay home. Don't cough on others. Wash your hands when there's crap on them." But as for lockdowns? Get some sun. As for ~~"vaccines"~~ inoculations? Expose yourself to real germs so that your immune system practices against pathogens, <strong><em>not against itself</em></strong>.</p>

        <p>On a per-case basis? Certainly not. In absolute terms? Undeniably. Even if you assume that deaths attributed to COVID-19 are exaggerated by a factor of 10, it would still have killed 60,000x more people in the US then the last ebola outbreak did.</p>

<p>This authority is the government supported, mainstream corporate opinion saying that millions have died. Yes, these "scientists" are heavily influenced by those means. Those death numbers do in fact come from authority which does not correlate with reality. To adhere to that lie is a logical fallacy of appealing to authority.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure why you're being downvoted when you're not being belligerent or irrational, even though I disagree with your conclusion. It's a mistake to buy into the official death count for reasons that are covered below, but aside from that, I wanted to point out that danger, as a concept, is relative. They say the flu kills around 50,000 annually in the US too, but no one thinks twice about it.</p>
<p>These statistics don't mean much on their own - we assess danger based on deviation from the norm. Coronaviruses, as a family, are common. We know for a fact that this one isn't particularly deadly. We also know that it was circulating before anyone started talking about it, and nobody noticed. We know the all-cause mortality figures for 2020 are similar to every other year. We know the covid death count has been grossly inflated, too. The pertinent question IMO isn't whether or not the virus kills people sometimes, it's whether or not this scenario is unusual compared to what we are used to. I don't think it is, based on the stats.</p>
