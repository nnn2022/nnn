    <strong>Had a beautiful day in the city yesterday, saw people moving on with their lives.</strong>
    <p><p>The sun was shining endlessly from morning to sunset without a cloud in sight and the weather was warm a summer day it could be, with a constant breeze brushing against one's sweat as brief respites from the heat. People were all crowded along our waterfront, much more than I remember than in previous summers, perhaps because restaurants and bars are still closed for the most part and there were few other clear places to socialize. But the patios I did see open were packed, and all had lines to get in, with people sitting without masks and without any noticeable 'social distancing'.   </p>
<p>If one had been completely unaware of what was happening for the last five months and simply stumbled upon all the people on the waterfront, one would be none the wiser that anything particularly strange had taken place, other than perhaps a few people wearing masks outdoors (a small minority).  </p>
<p>I don't even bother with the doomers in my life anymore. If someone wants fear to be the driving force in their life, then there is nothing I can do about that, and it isn't my problem to fix. As I saw all the people enjoying the weather, the water, and their time with friends, I realized there are still plenty of people who have moved on from the hysteria and have let their own inner sense guide them outside to be able to savor the peace and scenery we still can experience. And this is in a city and country where the media and politicians have been bombarding us with every single chicken little talking point 24/7. Seeing the people outside was like the figurative finger turning the TV off, or the long scared cave dweller stepping on to the warm grass and being reanimated by the foreign sun that is the beacon to a better world.</p>
<p>I am not trying to downplay all the great many challenges we will still face, and all the encroachments and violations of rights that are surely on the way. But part of the relief from any difficulty is in knowing that one's predicament isn't permanently set, and that others have dealt with it successfully it as well, suggesting this is a temporary rather than eternal obstacle. And in the worst case, that we are facing true dystopia, we may as well enjoy our human lives while we can, rather than decline into the contorted paranoid balls of fear that the doomers want us to be.</p></p>

        <p>Why does it always strike me like these posts are fabrications or people assuming that their life being normal in whatever red state they are from means it's like this <strong>everywhere</strong>? It just seems like feel good nonsense, no offense...</p>
<p>Like I've said repeatedly, since March, my area is the complete opposite. Masks everywhere, even with the 90+ degree weather in full swing. People jumping away in fear when people get too close. Huge queues to get into stores or inside of them for check-out. Everyone looking scared and/or pissed off in general. I'm in Pennsylvania, which has a Democrat governor who's been adding tons of restrictions, and people seem to favor him. I also venture into NJ and DE, and see similar atmospheres to this overall. I don't see the utopia people claim there is "once you step foot outside".</p>

        <p>I agree. I read these and think gee must be great not to live in NJ between NYC and Philly where people are still sucked into this nonsense to the point I’m seeing more and more masks outside. </p>
<p>I see reality and in reality things here haven’t gotten much better, just more and more restrictions. When I voice that here there’s always people like “oh you’re a doomer, I don’t see masks anywhere”. I see my reality and idk if these people just make shit up, they don’t go outside, or it’s honestly different. My first thought with the feel good posts was that people just want to make us seem more crazy, hopefully I’m just reading into it too much.</p>

        <p>Kind of glad to see you back me up. I've had people from PA and NJ attack me at LDS, claiming that "Nah, everything is super perfect and normal, no one is wearing masks anywhere, people are relaxed and living their lives super happily". I...don't see this. At all. Makes me think they are blatantly lying or just going to places this isn't at, even though I haven't been to any place in PA or NJ or DE as they describe.</p>

        <p>I agree.. I've only just seen the hysteria just get worse and a lot of people say "iTs oNlY On tHe iNtErNeT bRo!!" But no, places are still being shut down again, heavily restricted, or probably just not gonna reopen at all. I try to go outside and take a walk to get out of the house for a bit, I see people with masks in their cars drive by and people jogging with masks on... plus now tons more places are now requiring masks to enter...people are still fucking scared and that's not changing anytime soon, sadly. They've ignored the evidence and science for this long, they're not gonna pay attention to it now...</p>

<p>I know. I get that sort of response <strong>a lot</strong>. I feel like if you live in a midwest town or something, then maybe life will seem more normal... But I live in and visit "big", "blue" states that are getting hit worst with hysteria. It's not just online, I see it when I step out the door, and I see my neighbors in masks or screaming at people walking down the street without masks.</p>

        <p>I was just out at a mall a while ago, and as I was exiting a store, a dude that was about to enter, jumped clear out of my way. I was like, "Oh, sorry" (out of reflex...), and he just kind of glared at me before going in. And yeah, lots of masks out today, even though the heat index is 110. Not sure how people stand it.

        <p>I don't doubt there are places more affected by the hysteria. And I still think some places will get worse before getting better. I have read enough cases like that where it still saddens me. I still think it's going to vary by region and government. But if you are in a prison, would you prefer to hear that the whole world is in prison, and there is no point in living? Or that there are people who have escaped and are freer to live their lives? I am seeing more people escaping prison in my daily life. The doomer perspective is to close everything down, literally. Your emotional and psychological life included, to make it seem like there is no choice but to shut down forever. Once that is seen as arbitrary, temporary, and local rather than global, it loses power.</p>

<p>I feel like hearing that the whole world is in prison is <em>more honest</em>, to be frank. Because, especially with more and more places beginning to mandate things like masks, and putting up ridiculous plastic dividers, and governments throwing around ideas like "rolling lockdowns", it certainly feels like we're not very free right now. </p>
<p>I also don't see people escaping the proverbial prison. I just don't. Not here, or anywhere I visit. There is less people out and about since the "case surging in FL, TX, AZ" narrative began, around earily July, and those who are out in public really don't appear to be having much fun. I go to malls and arcades, and whatnot, often. There's a lot of tension in the air. Going into stores is stressful because people need to wait in lines, and it feels like employees are rushing you around as well. You can't just <em>shop</em> and have fun with it now. People also just seem super nervous and anxious, because they probably second guess themselves being out in public, and fear becoming infected with COVID (or maybe they are uncomfortable with masks or something?).</p>

        <p>I'm in a Chicago suburb. Went to beach volleyball tournament Sat. A couple hundred spectators/players. Didn't see a mask. It was just so normal and I didn't even think about it until I saw this post. </p>
<p>People in this area consistently use masks in indoor spaces, but rare to see one outdoors.</p>

        <p>That's great for you. And I'm glad to hear it. Truly.</p>
<p>But I'm going to continue to be pissed that my kids aren't going to have school or any activities next year because of this bullshit.</p>

        <p>People are so on edge even more than usual these days. I’m in a small CA town that is somewhere in the middle - we have massage places open but no indoor dining, for example. The city council blocked traffic in our tiny downtown for outdoor seating, and in general people don’t wear masks outside. I would say we’re luckier than most. </p>
<p>That said, at the grocery store this morning I brought my reusable bags (I just hate excess waste), and it was suddenly this huge inconvenience for everyone. The cashier was upset because she couldn’t touch them. No biggie I always bag my own, but just me carrying them past her to the bagging spot freaked her out. Then I apparently I took too long to bag my own groceries and held up the line, causing someone to complain to the manager. Finally I paid and got out of there while people were glaring at me and my germy bags the whole time. </p>
<p>Ofc I was wearing my mask properly the whole time and maintaining distance but seriously people will look for any excuse to be assholes right now. I’ve decided to just ignore the haters and focus on coming out of this stupid lockdown better than I went in. As for friends, I’m putting all that off until it’s possible for me to leave the US. I speak 4 languages and I’m done with this place.</p>

<p>A year ago, people were all big on corporations being wasteful and low-wasting the hell out of everything.  Now, I see more people using more disposable stuff than ever.</p>
