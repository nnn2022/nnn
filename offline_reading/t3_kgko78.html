    <strong>Lets all just think of 'masks' in a different scenario</strong>
    <p><p>Lets just re-think masks for a minute here.  How would the world react if some arbitrary agency decided 'yoga pants' couldn't be worn in public; could you imagine the uproar from moms, women, teenagers? Lulumom (or whatever would be the first to have a giant corporate fit) There would be instant rebellion.   What if someone decided those super short shorts were not appropriate to be worn 'out in public'- again there would be such an out cry.  How about no basketball shorts or tank tops for men at the grocery store- men need to wear regular slacks and shirts when purchasing food.  All in the name of hygiene and health.</p>
<p>Can you just imagine the cries of displeasure?  Not a single person would follow that nonsense.  No one would give up 'yoga pants'  'super short shorts'  'basketball shorts'  'flip flops'  anything  but yet the entire world follows some blanket order to wear a mask, stay home and dont touch anything.</p>
<p>Yes my eyes would prefer no yoga pants and no short ass shorts but hell, wear whatever the heck you want.  I'm not the fashion police   I like my sandals, maybe other people dont like my feet?</p>
<p>I'm looking at spending thousands of dollars on orthodontics per kid, that work is NOT going to live under a mask.  (sorry honey, you dont get your braces, just wear a mask)  </p>
<p>Its been a very long year- I'm so sick and tired of the non sense.</p></p>

        <p>It’s an interesting question.
Let’s say they decided anything of lighter weight fabric than jeans or canvas allowed intestinal viruses to transmit from our buttholes. Would everyone comply and stop wearing anything except jeans or canvas pants? (Skirts would obviously be out of the question) </p>
<p>With enough propaganda I bet people would do it, but idk.</p>

        <p>OP make sure your kids get retainers and also their wisdom teeth pulled. I spent years in braces only to have my wisdom teeth pop out and ruin everything all over again. Also just learned this year that retainers are for LIFE.</p>

        <p>we are doing orthodontics later aka not age 8-9 but in the teens so hopefully some of the 'do-overs' are avoided.  Hopefully they will be old enough, mature enough etc to understand the decision, and they always have the option to delay or say 'NO'. (saving me thousands upon thousands of dollars per kid).   </p>
<p>And you can bet the world is going to see that million dollar smile,</p>

        <p>Nowadays if a law was passed that men couldn’t wear tank tops and shorts, half the men would be down on their knees praising how great of an idea it is because it will limit toxic masculinity of showing off muscles. All the kids will be taught from kindergarten how harmful it is for men to wear tank tops and shorts. Wouldn’t surprise me one bit.</p>

        <p>It's like if the govt required everyone to wear a hobble on their legs so they couldn't run too fast, because that's dangerous to do in public.</p>
<p>Not only is it intrusive to your freedom of movement, but it discriminates against those with disabilities.</p>

        <p>It’s just public dress code. Just like “no shoes, no shirt, no service”. Or how some businesses require people to wear suits. Or how female flight attendants have to wear heels. Or how teachers are not allowed to wear leggings without long shirts. Or how students in school are not allowed to wear hats during the national anthem. You have the ability to wear whatever you’d like in the privacy of your own home, but there is a dress code in public. For the time being, masks are a part of that dress code even though they are not enjoyable to wear.</p>

        <p>There is no public dress code. WTF are you talking about? As long as your dick isn't hanging out you can wear whatever you want in public. There is no law in the US anywhere mandating masks, only executive orders, completely bypassing the checks and balances built into the system.</p>
