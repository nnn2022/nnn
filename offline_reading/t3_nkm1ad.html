        <p>Tired of my family and friends asking me when I'll get vaccinated. I don't even want to waste my energy explaining why not because no one cares enough to actually hear why. They just want to assume im a Trump supporter or conspiracy theorist and leave it at that. </p>
<p>Everyone who got vaccinated just wants everyone else to get vaccinated too. Like when your bachelor friend gets married then all of a sudden wants everyone else in the friend group to be married too.</p>

        <p>How do you deal with the questions? The 'When do you get your vaccine' topic is quite popular at my work. I just don't know what to respond to a coworker when they ask me when I get it or if I already got it. I'm concerned they'll see me as a anti vaxxer, or same like you, a trump supporter or a conspiracy theorist. But I'm not. There's one coworker who thought the same as me, but surprisingly got the vaccine. So I feel like I'm the only coworker around who isn't going to take it. I feel almost ashamed, but I'm not going to take it because everyone takes it. I don't trust it (yet).</p>

        <p>Lost my job because I’m not vaccinated. Small company, guy at the top is really worried about the virus and everyone else just goes along with what he says, whatever... The bright side is it only took me 4 days to get a new job offer. Companies are desperate for employees where I live and this new job pays better.</p>
<p>I feel like I won the lottery tbh. I didn’t want to sit through any more zoom-based HR meetings where they pressure you to get the vaccine. I’m sick of them. This was the first time I’ve been fired in my life but I don’t feel bad, I feel great.</p>
<p>I’m excited to start the new job! If it doesn’t work out, fuck it, I’ll just apply somewhere else. I’m so sick of this garbage.</p>

        <p>It’s a full time admin assistant position, they need help answering phones and filing contracts. It should be nice! I asked if they had a vaccine policy in the interview and the woman I interviewed with said, “Nope! We trust people to take care of their own health.” It was a huge relief to hear!</p>

        <p>I’m currently in the waiting room at my dentists office.  We had to get “screened” and given a sticker before entering the building at the doctors office next door.  (It’s a community clinic so it’s all in the same tiny block).  A severely overweight nurse walked in before me without wearing a mask and was not screened at all.  They just said hi, gave her a mask and she walked in with it in her hand.  They quickly pointed the inaccurate temp gun at my head and asked me 20 questions before I could enter and then another 20 when I made it to the dentists office.</p>
<p>Why is this theatre still happening???  This is so fucking pointless and I’m not sure why these unhealthy and quite frankly dumb nurses aren’t held to the same stupid “standards” that we are forced to abide by.</p>

        <p>I think people really just like to be told what to do. They fear freedom, because subjugation is comforting. At this point, it may be too late to wake some close-minded people up, but if you show little signs of disobedience, like wearing the mask on your chin, people will notice you aren't dead and realize how silly this is. Just keep calm, and remember this: Name one time in history when the bad guys won in the long run- the truth always wins eventually. Just stay strong.</p>

        <p>The nurses aren't interrogated on the way in because they've already been emailed a list of the facility's guidelines and are expected to self-evaluate before leaving for work. ("Was I on an international flight last night? No. Was anyone in my household diagnosed with covid last night? No. Do I have a cough? No. Do I have a fever? <em>Checks using own thermometer.</em> No.)</p>
<p>It is also very likely that the security guard just assumes the nurse didn't travel to a covid hotspot and return in the 30 minutes between going out on her lunch break and coming back.</p>

        <p>What summer was that in which it went away? We are <em>down</em> to infection levels from last summer and people are still dying. Fortunately, they're mostly anti-mask wearers, and we're almost back to where we were before the pandemic; thanks, Biden.</p>
<p>Flu kills 10k-30k per year in normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Last year there were very few deaths due to influenza. (Some say that's because of the masks.)</p>
<p>In the same time frame 500k people died of covid-19.</p>
<p>Even if you attribute the expected flye deaths entirely to covid, there's still about 470k more expected deaths.</p>

        <p>"What happened?" The government financially incentivized hospitals to record deaths as COVID deaths even though 96% of those had at least one other cause of death (4% of 500k is 20k, by the way, right in line with what you would expect for the flu). Almost everyone who died after testing positive for COVID-19 was recorded as a COVID death. The test used to determine whether or not someone even had the disease was a PCR test run for as many as 40+ repetitions when for any other disease if you don't have a positive result by 35 repetitions, usually even fewer, you record the result as negative.</p>
<p>So 500k is the number of people who died of any cause after testing positive on an intentionally broken test. That's what happened.</p>

        <p>That's because we effectively had two spikes instead of one. The first in march/april as we had first contact with the virus which got cut short by summer arriving and then the normal fall/winter seasonal spike. That explains the higher access mortality.</p>
<p>If you compare spike for spike it's comparable to bad flu season which makes sense as it's fresh out of a lab doing gain of function research which gave it a head start. Now that we have had widespread contact with the virus it will trend towards normal flu numbers.</p>

        <p>In my research, I have never found evidence of a flu season that killed 100,000+ Americans, let alone 300000, since 1918. </p>
<p>Neither, for that matter, have epidemiologists.</p>

        <p>I absolutely have been unhappy about money printing manipulations since the early 2010s in fact. It just got much worse with covid as the excuse.</p>
<p>I don’t wish harm to fall on anyone but there are always trade offs that we have to make as a society. We can’t destroy everything good in the world because a very small percent of people are susceptible to covid. We already have been making trade offs like this as a society all the time, but for some reason covid is special and requires flipping the whole table over.</p>

        <p>I don't trust the Government, usually, and I do trust science and doctors who claim masks are effective at spreading disease.</p>
<p>I expect every anti-masker will demand their dentists and surgeons remove their masks during a procedure, since, you know, those masks are only hurting them.</p>

        <p>I'm not here to entertain you. Why are you wasting your time? We have different opinions, just let it be. You can feel all superior and edgy, that's fine. Masks protect in some ways and not the others, and you know it, and i know it. Why even discuss it? There is a  difference about wearing a mask during surgery/dental apoinment and wearing a mask when you're bicycling outside. Like cmon. Stuff is not black and white</p>

        <p>My employer just decided that we don't have to wear masks at work anymore... if you are wearing the "vaccine sticker" that the medical department will provide to those that show a proof of vaccination. That means that even though I had covid 6 weeks ago, and I am immune, I will have to continue wearing a sheeple mask. And as a result I will get asked by coworkers daily if I got a vaccine and why not...
Not happy.</p>

        <p>Its a chemical plant and there are about 900 people who work on site here, so yes there is a medical dept. They normally handle on boarding (drug test and keeping records of physicals) as well as annual physicals and clearing to return to work after an injury or surgery.
As far as the vaccine sticker goes. I'm still in shock that they have the balls to try this. We will see how it plays out.</p>

        <p>There's a regional grocery store chain in my area (in the south) that has started having the fully vaxxed employees wear a "vaccinated" sticker on their nametags. If they're not fully vaxxed, no sticker &amp; they still have to wear a mask. I thought the company was blowing smoke for a bit until I went to one of the stores to grab some groceries &amp; saw that they ARE in fact doing this. I'm still unclear if the disclosure is voluntary or not (hearing conflicting info), but making one's vax status public ike that in any case is very unsettling.</p>

        <p>It probably won't make any difference, but here's a good resource if they're willing to listen to data: <a href="https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/">https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/</a></p>
<p>Since April of last year, only 316 children have died out of about 4 million cases. That's tragic, but also incredibly rare; it's a CFR of 0.00008. For reference, in the 2017-2018 flu season (most recent one I could find an estimate for) the CDC estimated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.htm#danger">around 600 children died</a>.</p>
<p>If they're worried about COVID, they should be absolutely mortified at the idea of someone being around her kids with the flu.</p>

        <p>I don’t have any fearmongering agenda. It is the media that is doing the fearmongering, about covid. My only agenda is for us to not change the social contract to suddenly require everyone to take this new vaccine tech just to participate in society. Covid does not warrant <strong>any</strong> required changes to our life. It is not that serious.</p>

        <p>We cannot afford to shut down businesses either. The economic fallout is likely on the way.</p>
<p>The panic remains because, no, normal is not back until it's like 2019 again. We have to accept some risk of viral infection. No required vaccines just to go to work, enter a grocery store, or travel on a plane. No masks. i.e. no new normal.</p>

        <p>On the economy, the verdict is still out on that. It might become a lot worse than what we've seen so far. Just because stocks and housing prices are up doesn't mean things are going well. I'm sure you know about all the money printing and the vast inequalities being created by this situation. How convenient this situation was for the top 0.1%.</p>
<p>I don't understand why you say people have been getting a vaccine for decades. Yes, people have been getting "vaccines" for decades. When I travelled to southeast/South Asia in 2018 I sought out and received many vaccines to help protect myself from truly serious diseases like rabies, typhoid, etc. But this is the first mRNA tech that's been launched for the masses. Sure, I think mRNA is a pretty cool tech, and I would gladly sign up for it for something like a cure for cancer - something where the risk is clearly outweighed by the benefit. I don't think it's right to coerce people to take a vaccine that they reasonably feel might not be worth the risk to themselves.</p>
<p>&rt; What’s your problem with the “new normal,” that it’s harmful or that it’s just different?</p>
<p>My problem with the new normal is that I believe this situation has been constructed to change society. There have been too many coincidences for me to believe it was just bad luck. Maybe this vaccine is benign but if the precedent is set for coercing the populace to do anything the state asks, that is a scary precedent.</p>

        <p>&rt; Considering businesses are opening up again, I’d say it’s unlikely for things to get much worse economically.</p>
<p>I think things are looking up economically for now, but the excessive money supply expansion and piling on of debt around the world is unsustainable. The covid response severely exacerbated this.</p>
<p>&rt; I doubt it, since as you said the economy was tanked for many and that’s kind of what the 0.1 percent rely upon</p>
<p>What if it's not about money? The world is in trouble: WW3 risk, climate change, UFOs. Maybe only a united world can save humanity from itself... Also, even in monetary terms the rich never had to lose a penny, since asset prices were pumped.</p>
<p>&rt; This would require some insane coordination</p>
<p>What happens behind closed doors in Switzerland? I am not sure.</p>
<p>&rt; Mrna has been used for other vaccines for years.</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines have been studied for some years, but this is the 1st time they are being marketed to the public: "mRNA Vaccines Are New, But Not Unknown" at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html. The specific protein coded for by the covid vaccine presumably hasn't been tested longer than since early 2020.</p>
<p>&rt; The precedent has been set to do anything the state says since laws have been a thing.</p>
<p>Required covid vaccination (if it becomes de facto required to meaningfully live life) feels more like conscription to me than say seat belt laws. Compelling the individual take an action that risks their own body.</p>
<p>The vaccines have been said to be highly effective, even against variants, so that weakens the argument about the vaccine being required to protect others. And we don't have vaccine passports for measles, a more contagious and deadly disease.</p>

        <p>Science's job is to discover the facts about covid and to make recommendations about how to respond. They are not dictators. Regular people have real lives that have been seriously disrupted by the "scientifically optimal" way to handle covid. So politics gets involved which is a process of the people (allegedly) deciding what type of covid response is worth it.</p>

        <p>Good, you tell em! "It's a small price to pay" - nobody can ever quantify this. At what point - how many vaccine effects/injuries - does this no longer become a small price? 50000 people? 100000 people? You can't give it a number, and even if you could, different people would likely suggest different numbers. That's why we need to let everybody decide on their own risk levels. Something that may be a small price for you could be a large one for me, and vice versa. The only way to reconcile those differences is to give people individual freedom to act in the way they feel is best. It may only be a "small price" for some people, but I'm still not willing to pay it. If you are, then <em>you</em> get the jab - that's what all this boils down to. My body my choice.</p>

        <p>People in r/movies are crying about AMC allowing vaccinated guests to take off their masks without proof of vaccination, saying that the non-vaccinated will take theirs off anyway. And you know what, they are exactly right! And good riddance. These masks need to be thrown in the dust bin of history. The sooner people take off these masks, the sooner they'll realize what a load of crap they've been fed for over a year.</p>

        <p>Even if they DID verify at the door, as if unvaccinated people wouldn't just take their masks off once they're seated and the lights go out for the movie anyways. Do they think they'd have employees making regular checks during the movie to ensure the unvaccinated guests are all still wearing their masks?</p>

        <p>I honestly don't see how the inescapable propaganda and open youtube censorship of any even slightly critical viewpoint doesn't automatically make people more skeptical of trusting these so-called "experts".

        <p>I think it's more turning a blind eye. They feel supported enough by that system and don't want to jeopardize it- they want to be part of the hive. It allows them to blend in and live a hedonistic, invisible, or automated life.</p>
<p>Plenty of people know about poor labor conditions and inhumane animal practices, and yet still buy products and food within that context.</p>

        <p>The viewpoint is entirely different. You can see it when you read between the lines of the concern trolls who post here.
For them, it's not "censorship", because they have the erroneous belief that you can't censor wrong information. It's "combatting misinformation" which, to them, is a good and just thing.</p>
<p>They lack the perspective (and probably the age) to see how bureaucracies can do wrong, to see how authorities are not nearly as diligent as we'd like to believe, how corporations can allow bad things to happen.</p>
<p>I saw a thread with a couple Doomers chatting about how people are concerned about period/pregnancy issues with the vaccine. One of them said "like they wouldn't study that!"... But indeed, they didn't study that, pregnant women were not part of the trials because of general scientific caution around pregnant women.</p>
<p>So it's really a lack of perspective. My wife was pretty pro government, and a few months back we were talking about the New Normal and vaccines, and she didn't understand why I had such a hard time trusting the government. Hell, I was an infantryman once.</p>
<p>Once I showed her the Wikipedia pages on the Tuskegee experiments, and the Nayirah testimony, and the Downing Street memo, and MK Ultra, she started to see it.</p>

        <p>&rt; how corporations can allow bad things to happen.</p>
<p>Because corporations have a profit motive which causes a conflict of interest.  </p>
<p>I have two observations/questions based on this:</p>
<p>Why is Bill Gates so adamant about sharing/opening up the vaccine patents?  If COVID is as serious as we're being led to believe, wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to manufacture vaccines?</p>
<p>Why are drugs like HCQ and Ivermectin being ignored and not even being studied seriously?  If we have drugs that are cheap to manufacture and have well known safety profiles, why not study them in case they provide some relief?</p>

        <p>In the case of HCQ: one hospital reported promising early results, but from a very sloppy study. Subsequent, more rigorous studies showed that it was useless.</p>
<p>I haven't seen the literature on Ivermectin, so can't comment. I do know that early on they launched a lot of studies of known drugs that looked like they had a chance of interfering with covid.</p>
<p>In the case of Gates, he's got a strong pro-intellectual-property bias.</p>
<p>In the case of Big Pharma, they have a strong pro-patent bias. They want money; opening up the patents means less money.</p>

        <p>I have nowhere else to bitch about this: EVERY SINGLE app dating profile bio has “fully vaxxed!” in there somewhere or some cute little quip about it. I am in the SF Bay Area, so i definitely expected that people are pro-vaccine but it’s like it’s people’s only fun cute quippy thing they can say. These are the exact same people who were on the apps in the summer, going around making out willy nilly and then shoving the mask back over their face, but now it’s all about the vax because that’s what’s cool and in. I don’t give a single darn tootin fuck about your vaccination status, and in fact, it’s literally NONE OF MY BUSINESS. And it’s the least interesting thing about anyone, ever. Whew ok</p>

        <p>Do you genuinely think masks only protect in one direction?</p>
<p>Masks are <em>very</em> effective against transmitting the disease. Something on the order of 70% reduction of exhaled droplets, if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>Masks are <em>somewhat</em> effective against getting the disease. Around 30% if I recall correctly, in part because it gets in through mucous membranes like in eyes, and also because it gets on your hands and you rub your eyes, and also because dummies wear their masks below their nose and many of them are not mouth-breathers.</p>

        <p>There is loads of studies showing no effect including large RCTs. </p>
<p>All the mechanistic evidence is based on assumptions on how the disease spreads. Not on actual spread in the real world. There is no reason to believe exhaled droplets is a meaningful outcome. All the early observational data is heavily confounded by mask introduction after the peak of the first spike. Newer observational data shows masks had no effect on the spread of covid.</p>
<p>The overwhelming evidence is against masks. They used very weak evidence along with the wrong principal "it might help which makes it worth it as there is no cost" to introduce and maintain an absurd intervention. </p>
<p>The only function of masks is to remind people of the invisible enemy and maintain fear.</p>

        <p>This is factually incorrect.</p>
<p>Also, you don't believe masks inhibit the distribution of droplets, or that the disease is largely spread through inhaled droplets?</p>

        <p>Ontario resident here (sadly). It annoys me that Olympic athletes are allowed to continue going to a gym to workout while us regular folk/plebs likely won't see the inside of a gym again until August. Going off of the government's rules and regulations, sport is not 'essential' right now... So why should athletes be able to go workout at a gym no problem while we can't? Apparently sport isn't essential, so then neither are the Olympics or the medals they could win.</p>
<p>Fuck the government. Open the gyms.</p>

        <p>I’m living up here in Canada and I feel like I’m in a movie. I can’t believe how far this has gone and how many people I know - friends, family, colleagues, and etc have been duped by this whole charade. In Ontario, us opening up (we’re in lockdown) is no longer tied to case count (which is BS/ PCR test is bullshit) and instead how much of the population has been vaccinated. It’s astounding how many people are blindly accepting and shooting up these vaccines. I had a neighbour legit ask me if I’ve been vaccinated yet. I was like, hell no. I listed all the reasons as to why; 99.97% survival rate, FDA emergency approved, Clinical trials still going on, no liability by vaccine corps and etc....the response I got...deer in headlights. </p>
<p>Many of friends, family and colleagues have been vaccinated or will get it. I’m honestly praying that nobody i know will get adverse side effects/die. I still can’t believe the level of control the media has on people. They keep repeating the same lies, spin the truth, and distort reality until people have no idea what to believe. These same politicians like NDP Jasmeet Sing who say people who don’t want the vaccine, nor want to wear masks, or not comply are selfish, right wing, racists lol. Then he gets caught hugging a friend with no mask and no social distancing..hypocrites....and when they caught they just apologize. Do as I say, not as I do....</p>

        <p>I'm in Ontario too... It's a fucking circus show here. Everything you said is so bang on. It's so wild to me that after ALL the back and forth and weird shit our politicians have done, that people STILL blindly follow them. This new reopening plan is an absolute fucking joke too. The fact that enough people looked at that and went "yup this sounds reasonable" to approve it baffles me. By July festivals and concerts will be resuming in the USA, Quebec will be back to open gyms, restaurants, bars, etc etc... And meanwhile we're <em>maybe</em> going to be 'allowed' to eat on a patio. But that's it.</p>

        <p>I hear you man. The Ontario reopening plan is complete bullshit. Apparently, they’re going hard on Ontario since we are the economic engine of Canada and wiping out all the independent businesses (leaked gov memo last year) is their main prerogative. Justin Fidel Castro wants to turn canada into Chinada and the way to do it is to bankrupt the country into debt, create hyper inflation by printing money, and being the Maxist puppet that he is. </p>
<p>Alberta is going full Texasb in July apparently. It’s getting more and more appealing to move out there.</p>

The only thing legally standing between us and that outcome is a smattering of corporate whore republicans, who (in the absence of Trump) are now the primary focal point for sustained media attacks.

        <p>There's a difference between freedom and lack of infrastructure. There may be places where currently nobody is bothering to oppress people, but much of Africa is subject to the possibility of corrupt governments, unaccountable unofficial local leadership, and insurgency. There are if course developed areas, but I doubt any are as free as the west.</p>

I rarely see anybody talking about more exotic parts of the world on this sub, so maybe a lot of them are just blissfully living their lives without the extreme reactions of US/Canada/EU? Without on-the-ground reports I really don't trust whatever the news is telling me about far-off places.</p>

        <p>I'm thinking the same. They're probably laughing at the rest of the world right now. I've watched a few YouTube vlogs of people traveling to Tanzania and such, and it seems so much saner.</p>

        <p>I guess it's the relevance part that I think is weird. Trump hasn't been president for months and that Q nonsense has been gone a while as far as I know. Why are these loons still clinging to that stuff? Shouldn't surprise me I guess. I just heard some young woman at the office I'm in saying politics is a "literal" civil war.

        <p>Q got laughed off of /pol/ of all places. That's how it ended up on 8chan. It, like pizzagate, took child trafficking conspiracies that people have been talking about for decades and added some pro-Trump anti Dem silliness. It mostly appealed to people who weren't already aware of stuff like the Finders, Epstein, Franklin community credit union et Al. If you think about the claims that Q made, child trafficking networks among powerful people sound like the most insane part. You show the evidence of that to republicans then tell them that trump is working to stop it, it's not surprising they bought it</p>

        <p>Now we have a wave of new long covid patients that never had covid but got it as a side effect of the vaccine. I told this a few weeks ago and was downvoted but now is just obvious. </p>
<p>I have long covid myself and doctors don't know shit about it and now we are just triggering the same shit in previously healthy folks that decided to get the vaccine because "it was the right thing to do". I wonder how long will be able MSM to ignore so many testimonies. Just go lurk /r/covidlonghaulers and you'll find:</p>
<p>- people like me, that had Covid and our immune system never recovered (tho I am feeling way better than a few months ago, thank god)</p>
<p>- people that got it from the vaccine </p>
<p>What do we have in common? Doctors don't believe us and don't give a single fuck.</p>

        <p>Hey, I don't think is a propaganda expression but that's probably biased as I have long covid myself. I think that it's useful to distinguish long covid patients from other post viral illnesses as now it's a cluster of patients bigger enough to make specific research about how this virus in particular triggered certain symptoms. </p>
<p>A quick example. Now some long covid patients have an ME/CFS diagnose as their symptoms pretty much overlap with the experience of other post viral patients. On the other hand, other patients (like myself) have some symptoms that are "covid specific" as the chronic chest pain. </p>
<p>I am sad that MSM has taken our illness as a way to spread fear, that's not my intention here. I just hope we find what's happening to us and all the other post viral patients out there as it was an under researched topic.</p>

        <p>There's people who improved after the vaccine, people who got worse after the vaccine and people that had no changes to its long covid symptoms from the vaccine at all. </p>
<p>Same thing in the non-long covid population. People that had only a sore arm and people who died from the jab. </p>
<p>What all those cases have in common? Science has NO IDEA at all about why people's response it's so different. Zero. There are only a few research groups keeping an eye on that. No answers at the moment. </p>
<p>After a whole year going from one specialist to the other with long covid symptoms, I just know that I will not role a dice to find if I am part of the lucky ones or not. I'd rather wait.</p>

        <p>This isn't how the Covid vaccine works. It is not a live-virus vaccine like the flu. It is an mRNA vaccine that helps create a protein that binds to receptors on a covid cell and stop it from reproducing.</p>

<p>Before covid I was a simple redditor, bikes, cars and the occasional booty pics. But than I started talking about the evil that this experience has brought us all. The hive mind attacks. This is my 4th account in a few months. My last account got perma banned for saying you shouldn’t call the cops on your neighbours for breaking the arbitrary public health measures; this was in the Nova Scotia subreddit. I was banned from that subreddit. I replied to the ban message saying “whats the point? I can easily create a new account” BAM perma banned. I didn’t even break the rule I simply talked about breaking the reddit rule. </p>
<p>At this point I’m just gonna stay here. Talking to you guys. Furthering the hive mind bullshit this platform pushes. But I don’t give a shit. No point in engaging with the opposition at this point. They have no arguments just censorship. Also 90% of them are fat losers playing with star wars action figures in their single bedroom apartment. Alone.</p>

        <p>My girlfriend was all weirdly embarrassed because we went to an ice cream shop that is all outside and I refused to wear a mask in a parking lot.</p>
<p>Ended up starting and trend and people took them off or got in line without a mask. Just proves people will do anything to feel included.</p>

        <p>Indian here. Please don't watch even a single MSM that's showing dead bodies piled up and people dying on the roads. This is not Wuhan . Some points to mention
1. They have started 5g in villages and people and animals have started dying. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2Yzt8uuKXE">this link might help you</a>, though the language is not English. As always they blamed that covid spread to villages which is not true. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://odysee.com/@sanam.bakshi:d/trim.7B2BEE09-65EE-4DCB-A84C-53F145CC9D32:e">Another link that's on odysee showing the truth</a>.Check her other videos too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many villages in Haryana(a state in India) has banned these government officials and the police from entering their area , stopped 5g and are living peacefully. The media would never cover this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>PS: if anyone of you here have sources/links/news  that show the truth in India please do comment down or DM me. It's hard to find the right news because of MSM propaganda</p>

<p>Watched a child who couldn’t have been more than 13, who looked so unhealthy he was literally skin and bones. Double masked outside - walking up with his equally as pathetic looking father. </p>
<p>Seeing people walk out, keep there masks on outside with there ‘papers’ that will now help them feel morally superior and not have to worry about any of this ‘vaccine passport’ nonsense. Makes me sick. </p>
<p>At least tomorrow I won’t have a fever unlike most of them.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Both in the workplace and other social settings, they want us to think, “Oh wow, if I get vaccinated, I don’t have to wear this mask anymore and things can be back to normal”. It’s like bribery</p>

        <p>It’s horrible, was hoping my employer would go the “you can take your mask off if your vaccinated but we’re not going to require proof that you are”, like other businesses. But no, got an email saying “proof will be required at a later time”.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the corporate world has been difficult to deal with during all this. My employer actually requires immediate proof. I could go around without a mask, but since we are a small company, it’s very easy for someone to just report me to HR about it and then having to deal with all that lol, which if it got to that point I’d certainly speak up about it.</p>
<p>My entire state lifts restrictions (100% capacity and no masks) in about 2 weeks for both vaccinated and unvaccinated, but the documentation I received from work mentioned nothing about that date nor about unvaccinated people going maskless after that date, so I wonder what they’ll do about that. Maybe they’ll wait until that date and then notify us again, but from the looks of things I’m not counting on it</p>

        <p>My boyfriend got suspended from his job for not wearing a mask in Subway during his lunch break and getting thrown out because of it. Turns out some stupid invisible Beta saw him get into an argument with the subway worker (he didn't, she threatened to call the cops if he didn't put on a mask and his response was to offer to call them for her before walking out) and decided he would go tell their manager because he felt it was inappropriate behavior and management agreed and decided to suspend him for two days. 
At least the manager pointed out who the snitch was and when my bf went to ask him why he hadn't said anything to him in the restaurant (in the most civilized way, not confrontational) all the dude did was look at the ground and repeat "sorry man, it's the rules, it's the rules."</p>

        <p>its shocking the amount of people who don't even hear my viewpoints on the vaccine. As soon as I start to slightly question the legitimacy of it, everyone freaks out on me and assumes I'm some tinfoil-hat wearing, ultra right wing conspiracy nut. Like chill, let me mind my business and you mind yours. </p>
<p>My one friend asked me, "did you get the vaccine?" and when I responded, "maybe I did maybe I didn't" they instantly pointed out that if I had gotten it I would've admitted it and therefore  my response means I didn't get it. I walked away from that conversation because those mental gymnastics are too much for me lol.</p>

<p>Yep yep. I'll admit in the beginning before there was a vaccine, I easily would have been one of the sheep who went to get it but when I did start to realize why people weren't going to get it, I realized it made more sense not to get it. The whole thing is really sketchy especially when people have been getting silenced.</p>

        <p>Help. My husband wants to get the vaccine so that he doesn’t have to wear his mask at work anymore. All of his coworkers don’t wear one anymore Bc they’ve had the jab. So I’m sure he feels like the odd man out. And even more so because he’s the new guy at this job. He’s already had covid and beat it so I told him I think it’s kind of silly to get a vaccination for a virus he already has immunity to. I told him it’s his body and he can do whatever he wants but now he thinks I’m “one of those” people and that I’m anti vax. It’s very frustrating to me. What resources can I show him to help him be more informed about the vaccine and it’s risks?</p>

        <p>Hello</p>
<p>I'd suggest giving him a little crumb of information here and there, and eventually he'll start seeking it out on his own. As for specific resources, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</a> (then go to the comorbidities section) is pretty good. It shows him that most people (95%) that are dying "of COVID" actually had an average of 4 comorbidities and were aged 80-81 on average. That's a good crumb for him to start thinking "maybe I should start questioning some of this". For vaccine specific stuff, I'd show him VAERS, and then show him the study from Harvard about how only 10% of serious adverse reactions were reported. I know it can be frustrating, but just hang in there.</p>

        <p>Show him the myocarditis data. It’s effects males more. This is just coming out and could be a major side effect. Also, one thing I’m not seeing mentioned about it. If the vaccine is inducing myocarditis with only a few cells showing corona spike protein, imagine if you get exposed to coronavirus after the vaccine. The viral load will be bigger and thus your vaccine produced antibodies response will be larger. That could cause even more heart damage.</p>

        <p>Re: "Antivax"--this may or may not apply to you, but many here comment they support other vaccines, but have concerns about the COVID vaccines (e.g., rushed to market, new technology, stories about side effects, etc). If this appies to you, you might explain this to  your husband. (If you haven't tried.)</p>
<p>As I've mentioned before here, I like Pam Popper (Wellness Forum Health founder/president, who has been critical of COVID policy since 3/2020). She puts out a lot of material about COVID, including vaccine info. Some you have to pay for--like an upcoming COVID vaccine class. But she also does free videos and free (REFERENCED) newsletter articles.</p>
<p>Videos seem to be mostly on Bitchute, and I've heard links are a problem on Reddit. Some videos make it to Rumble: https://rumble.com/c/c-641957 </p>
<p>Newsletter articles (again REFERENCED):  https://wellnessforumhealth.com/forbidden-newsletter-articles/</p>

        <p>It's his body and he can do what he wants; he wants to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>It's not currently clear how long natural immunity lasts, and I suspect his prior covid experience makes him feel that he'd rather have a shot than a second run of covid.</p>

        <p>I'm so tired of the false equivalencies. I left a comment against vaccine passports being implemented due to them being a slippery slope towards segregation and civil rights issues and the most common reply I got back was "yOu nEeDeD vAcCiNeS tO gO tO sChOoL hOw wOuLd tHiS bE aNy dIfFeReNt?". </p>
<p>Yeah, because I can think back to all the times I needed to show proof of my MMR and yearly flu shot vaccinations in order to go to the gym, or to a restaurant, or to a club, or to a concert, etc etc... Are these people fucking serious!? Vaccine passports are WAY different than mandatory vaccines for school since they encompass a broad range of publicly shared spaces that they openly want to restrict people access from... Not <em>just</em> school. </p>
<p>And it's actually disturbing to me how I was being downvoted for that comment... These people openly want segregation. And they don't see anything wrong with that? Yeah, because segregation worked out great so many times in history that doing it again seems like such a great idea, am I right? Oh, but I guess this time it's different since it's for "the greater good". Mhm. What a concept! </p>
<p>These people are actually fucked and I don't think for one second they have honest intentions of looking out for the health and wellbeing of society as a whole. I think anyone strongly in favor of vaccine passports love the idea of being granted special privileges over people who choose not to get vaccinated. It's all a power and status thing IMO. With vaccinations open and available to anyone who wants them and COVID already present in literally every single country on earth, there's no reason to support the enforcement of vaccine passports. The people who want to protect themselves can protect themselves and those that don't and want to take the risk can take the risk. And i'm thankful to every politician worldwide that recognizes that and has outright condemned the implementation of them. Especially all the US states that have already banned their implementation.</p>
<p>It's just crazy how all these pro-vaccine passport people think the exact same way the most problematic people in history thought and yet they think they're the good guys. It's wild.</p>

        <p>I agree that there shouldn't be a passport and anyone condoning it is not really considering there other side or their bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>I worked in the healthcare field and I can tell you there's a lot going on that we should be very angry about (hence why I left). It desperately needs reform and has needed it for decades and perhaps anti-vaxxers will be the necessary spearhead for it! I don't think there's anything wrong with vaccines but the pharmaceuticals, unnecessary surgeries, callous doctors, understaffing, forced medical consent by implication, and general corruption of the insurance scheme are the real problems in my opinion. </p>
<p>Where there's smoke there's fire and the antivax movement is just the smoke, here.  It may even be being used as a deceptive technique - another strategy by foreign countries to divide us and make us weaker by not taking the vaccines!</p>

        <p>Exactly I thought about that too. The vaccines approved for schools were heavily researched and went through plenty of trials and <em>completed</em> all trials prior to being required. You can't say the same for COVID shots.</p>

        <p>At a Safeway in the Seattle area, the sign outside said non-vaccinated customers are encouraged to wear a mask. <strong>Encouraged</strong>, not required! That's a great sign, right? They'd say "required" if they wanted to segue into vaccine passports later. Or maybe I'm just naive.</p>

        <p>I guess I’m not surprised, I knew this state would do some drastic shit.  “Our local economy” will be just fine thanks to Gates &amp; Bezos.  My dude and I are planning on moving to Texas and we got a realtor today.  It’s not worth it to be here anymore, other than the picturesque scenery.  Definitely time to weigh out the options!</p>

<p>The fact that everyone wearing a mask when I go outside scares me a bit and i don't get used to it. Also it's hard to get motivated on virtual classes. There is no envirorment, and technucally there's no classmates, just other users. Imposible to get friends that way.</p>

<p>The truly weak people are those who are going along with the lockdown narrative. Actively fighting back takes real strength...nobody who protests the lockdowns is weak.</p>

        <p>TL;DR: life sucks and you deserve compassion, but improving yourself is your responsibility. </p>
<p>..............................</p>
<p>Ya'll are victims. You have been hurt by society and these "classes" your taking and lack of socialization are bullshit. </p>
<p>This is surely doing psychological harm to you. </p>
<p><strong>But what are you going to do?</strong> You going to get all mean and bitter and wallow in it? You can. You actually are a victim and would be justified. </p>
<p><strong>But that won't help.</strong> If you have to spend a lot of time in your room, do things to make your room nice. Maybe start doing pushups. Maybe reach out to folks that you are suffering too and just be a sane person they can talk to.</p>
<p>I highly recommend listening to Jordan Peterson. Esp his old stuff. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6CsGY8wpGw&amp;list=PL22J3VaeABQAbP8Fl9nB-yxu6YNfhUWtt&amp;ab_channel=JordanBPeterson">a good place to start</a>. He has whole college classes about finding meaning and not giving up - more precisely he's instructing kids that want to be psychologists how to do that for their patients.</p>

        <p>I can’t help but feel so hopeless with the way the world is right now. It’s difficult for me to separate what I’m seeing on the internet from what’s actually happening in reality. It’s like I want to try and have discussions with people but they just can’t be bothered. I wish I could have some way to speak up without being shut down or made to look a certain type of way. It’s so easy to group people up and assume they’re like this or that because of the media or whatever, but really it’s just another way to put us against one another. We’re all individuals who deserve to think for ourselves, and lately there’s not a lot of that going on. I don’t know!!! It’s not fair what’s happening and I feel like I can see right through it and I can’t do anything about it!!!! But then again I don’t know if the internet is making everything seem way more dystopian and terrifying than it actually is!!!! I just want everybody to stop and look at how insane everything has gotten and how quickly it happened, and just really think about it for a minute, because it’s not normal and nothing that’s being done is in your best interest!!!! Does any of that make sense</p>

        <p>Yesterday, I received news that my employer, a prestigious university, is going to require vaccines for all staff, and I was devastated. I have numerous reasons for not wanting to receive the vaccine - chief among them that I have a bad family health history (3 grandparents with cancer) and am very cautious about taking medicine. I have only taken the flu shot once in my adult life and immediately regretted it because I had take in due to pressure from my doctor. I suffer from migraines with neurological symptoms, so I am trying to find a doctor who will sign the required exemption form for me. I recently moved to a new state for this job, so I don't have a PCP yet. I have contacted dozens of lawyers for advice, my state senator and representative, and my governor and no one seems willing or able to help me. I feel so powerless it is making me sick. I have always fully supported anyone who wants to be vaccinated, but this should be my choice. I shouldn't be coerced into this at the threat of losing my job.</p>

        <p>My kids and I are all sick after being around newly-vaccinated people. I thought it was a simple cold, but finally I went to the doctor because the congestion, fatigue, and brain fog were so extreme, and it'd been almost two weeks. They convinced me to get a covid test: negative. I don't even have a sinus infection. I do have allergies, but NEVER have I been this sick from allergies. My kids are unusually tired and sleeping a lot, but just mild cold-like symptoms. Maybe it's nothing, but it's WEIRD. And my allergy medicines are barely touching this.</p>

        <p>Interesting - it could be, I just looked it up. I also learned that there are widespread similar cases right now in my area, among kids and adults. Everyone seems a bit confused by how suddenly it hit (mask-wearing is still very high here).</p>

        <p>I'm not an epidemiologist either... I fancy myself an armchair one with how much i've had to learn throughout the pandemic lol so don't quote me too much on this. But I have read reports about how people being isolated from each other and all the obsessive cleaning and sanitizing could cause our immune systems to 'relax' a bit since we're not exposed to as much viral or bacterial pathogens like we usually would, and therefore our immune system isn't as sharp as it usually is. So when we're exposed to people again and around the usual nasty cold and flu bugs, it could be more detrimental than usual since our immune systems are a bit dull.</p>
<p>But again, don't quote me on that. I've just read a few reports on it but I don't have any sources to back it up haha. It makes sense to me though.</p>

        <p>It's fine to question and want to learn, but that is clearly not the purpose of this sub, or at least many of the people within it.</p>
<p>It's one thing to question and try to learn, but many people are given the information and don't actually try to understand and learn it. They then come up with some radical idea of how it is bad, quite literally like conspiracy theorists.</p>

        <p>I know I keep mentioning it, but damn it's SO NICE not wearing a mask in stores anymore! No more fogging up my glasses and never being able to position that fucking mask to keep them from fogging up.</p>
<p>My youngest telling me that he loves not wearing a mask b/c he likes fresh air lol. And one of the maskless employees at Sam's giving my boy big compliments and telling him he has a great smile. </p>
<p>THIS is normal people. Not wearing masks. Seeing people's faces!</p>
<p>I think a lot of these people still wearing their masks will quickly take them off soon b/c it's already getting in to the high 90's here. I can't imagine wearing a mask in that weather. If they want to wear it though... whatever. You do you. Just remember you CAN take it off if you feel like you can't breath in this hot ass weather. Most people aren't going to give a damn.</p>

        <p>I’m going to bet on the second option, and not because I don’t believe for a second the wannabe world-controllers wouldn’t like to be rid of all of their opposition, no matter how weak it is. If they wanted to get rid of their opposition and make a vaccine that actually prevented people from dying, knowing there are plenty of “difficults” that wouldn’t jump at the chance to get the vaccine, they would actually need to release a deadly enough virus that would be fatal for anyone who wouldn’t get it.</p>
<p>Logistically, it’s far easier and MUCH less risky to unleash a relatively mild virus and gin up fear using the media they already control and then come up with the “solution”, which they can easily control what goes into it, such as substances that greatly reduce fertility over a period of several years ( and not saying the vaccines out now automatically make you infertile, because we simply don’t know enough yet and it’s all speculation). They know a majority of people, when scared enough, will be willing to easily sacrifice their freedom for safety and they can grow their power out of it, it’s classic Parasite Stress Theory.</p>
<p>edit: reddit shadow banned me so i can no longer post links. I strongly advise looking into parasite stress theory though, TLAV has some very good, in-depth research on it.</p>

        <p>I've been wondering the same thing for a long time and I still don't see any fully compelling arguments in either direction. Just because those are the obvious options don't mean we've accounted for all possibilities.</p>
<p>For example, another option: "It's literally insane groupthink all the way to the top, and the elites have fallen for their own dumb fear porn, and created an experimental vaccine in good faith with no idea what the long term consequences for anybody might be, and are actually getting the shot themselves."</p>
<p>I mean, if otherwise very reasonable doctors and specialists who work in hospitals can all get swept away by something they would have passed off as fundamentally impossible prior to March 2020 - what if the elites started their own stampede by accident? What if they were so busy dreaming up worldwide pandemics and letting their modeling carry them away, that they lost the ability to put the brakes on it once it "escaped the lab" (think tank)? What if this is a legit unintentional memetic pandemic, instead of a controlled psyop?</p>

        <p>I would love to believe the groupthink, but even a beginning look into history and the evil of men who seek absolute power indicates this is unlikely. None of this is an accident, as can be seen in looking at their own documents and well laid plans - Rockefeller lockstep doctrine, SPARS pandemic, Event 201, Bill Gates knowing there would be other pandemics, Fauci saying there would be "a surprise pandemic" for Trump, back in 2017. This is clearly planned.</p>

        <p>I am inclined to agree, for the most part. But a couple of data points that cause me to discount the simplest, most linearly conspiratological interpretation of what's happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why did the WHO, as well as Fauci, initially poo-poo the "OMG pandemic!" interpretation? Why do such a public about-face on their stance on masks, for example? The WHO had been under Gates's influence for years, he was already chummy with Fauci, etc. The idea that they simply didn't get the memo seems ... odd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the media now being more critical of Gates and Fauci, where they were untouchable before? Why is it now being publicly entertained that this was an escaped biological agent from China, when that was mere conspiracy theory before? We are seeing the "fact checkers" receiving new marching orders in plain sight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why the apparent ramp-down after Biden's inauguration (PCR thresholds etc), the surprise CDC turnaround on masking for the vaccinated (that caught many of the doomers off-guard, such that they still refuse to go without)? They have a majority ready to keep this shit going forever, to much more draconian levels of control, but now they are inexplicably easing off? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are some states (notably Florida) allowed to get away with essentially sidestepping The Program where it seems like every other politician has gone along with it enthusiastically and voluntarily? The whole assumption of a hidden hierarchy would imply their ability to turn the screws quickly on uncooperative leaders to maintain a unified front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is there more variety now in how different countries/provinces are handling this? It seems like WHO/CDC are saying "chill out, lol" while for example Ontario will never escape lockdown.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, some other possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What if this whole thing was a brilliant <a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/12/07/the-china-lockdown-sun-tzu-and-the-art-of-war/">Chinese psyche-out to destabilize the west</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technocrat preplanning aside, what if this whole thing wouldn't have gotten any traction outside of an election year? What if, in the US at least, it really was just a last-minute deal with the devil to facilitate mail-in voting? Hence the sloppy, off-message beginning which only later coalesced in late March 2020 into a unified front of 24/7 media pandemonium? Remember all the Democrats proudly calling it all bullshit before that? Why wouldn't the same dutiful servants of the elite have gotten any instructions before March?</p>
</li>

        <p>Anyone else dealing with family separation? My husband and I live in San Diego, but he is from the London and hasn't seen his parents in about 3 years now and is struggling with it. This is just insanely frustrating as neither of us will be getting the vax and are skeptical even of the tests, so have no idea when he'll ever see them again with all the crazy travel restrictions (esp. on the U.K. side). I'm grateful we both have our jobs, good health, and friends who actually know what's going on, but I just feel helpless with this. He is really close with his Dad, so it's been super hard on him living so far away in the first place, and this has just made it worse. I guess I'm just wanting to vent, and see if anyone else can relate or have words of encouragement regarding the U.K.'s progress. I keep seeing those huge protests in Trafalgar Square, which seems like a good sign, but it still seems like most Brits are happy to roll over on this one.</p>

        <p>The UK vaccinated around 40 million people with the first dose and 22 with the second, so I don't think this is going to improve anytime soon in terms of restrictions for travellers. What I can confirm is that the government doesn't care much about you following the self isolation rules or not when you arrive. </p>
<p>Between having a few PCRs VS the vaccine, I pick up the choice of travelling and having those tests done. Here most of the PCRs are sent to your home so you are the one doing it to yourself.</p>

THEY DONT WANT THE TRUTH !! THEY WANT YOU TO OBEY .. I’ve totally stopped giving any energy to anyone who is a walking covid zombie ...

        <p>Just speaking in terms of friendship, I would maybe let your friends know that you are uncomfortable talking about it with them rather than to lose friends. As an American, I have been in this situation as a conservative, Zionist, Jew. Either your friends will respect your agree to disagree POV or they won't and you may want to remove them from your life. I was "canceled" from people which is fine but I've never removed someone from my life simply because we couldn't see eye to eye on issues. If they don't understand you, they probably aren't good friends.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that. It's a double edged sword, because toxic relationships are, well..., toxic. And you're better off without them. </p>
<p>But loneliness is a killer. Relationships are human need and we go crazy and die without them. </p>
<p>I recommend you do something to get a new social circle now. If you end up needing to cut off the rest of your relationships, then you've got a fall back. If you get to keep your existing relationships, you get a few new friends. </p>

<p>100%! I really wish people realized that there is a wide spectrum of us against it who aren't insane. I'm a sane (I think so anyway!), educated, non Qanon follower professional against requiring this vaccination and I'm not even an antivaxxer.</p>

        <p>A few days after cdc announced you can take off the mask if youre vaccinated. At my job our manger talks about it and says customer don't have to wear a mask. Employees still do because we're still learning about this. WTF. We know everything about Covid. 
Few days later she complains about our truck drivers not wearing masks. I was going to tell her why should it matter. Your vaccinated. Day later our truck driver is now wearing a mask. I feel like there's no point for me to get the vaccine since I'm in the low risk group. 
I'm sick of this shit. I hate having to readjust my mask. Makes my ears iiritated. I can't even fucking breath when I'm doing heavy workload. I don't care if your vaccinated or not. You wanna get the vaccine cool. If you don't want to cool. It ain't my problem. ITS A YOU PROBLEM.</p>

        <p>Netherlands, ladies and gentlemen, has just approved mandatory 10 day quarantine for people entering the country, and made the violation fine of 435 EUR which is high enough that it will result in a criminal record, making it more difficult to secure certain jobs, and to maintain a residency permit.</p>

        <p>I hope everyone doing ok. I had probably my worst sem of school this past sem. I just started grad school and it was depressing. I had very little friends or time to hangout with them. My life was basically study, assignments, and decompressing with what little time remained in between. Obviously no real social events or parties or any community on campus right now... I think that’s what made it so hard for me. But I still got 1 year left of school and I hope things will be better. I’m pretty extroverted and having stuff like a community and nightlife makes me feel more alive and I haven’t had that do something definitely feels like it’s missing. I’ve thought about maybe going on some dates or something just to try and move on w my life and start doing more shit of my own accord you know. It’s really dumb to me we 14 months into this hysteria and we are at a point where EVERYONE WHO HAS WANTED A VACCINE HAS GOTTEN ONE so whatever is keeping society closed off or indoors at this point makes 0 sense to me. I swear ima be so mad if I’m back on campus in august and there’s still clouds of hysteria running around. At what point does everyone move on? You and your loved ones are probably vaccinated if you care so much. If you don’t care so much or you’re cautious and not vaccinated, they can’t force you right so why doesn’t society just respect these peoples choices and start moving on with reopening? People who aren’t vaccinated might be younger/healthier or they’re older and know what risks they’re getting themselves into anyways. There is no perfect solution. But you got all these people suffering in more ways than one myself included cuz of this hysteria so I just don’t see when it ends. I genuinely believe I gotta move to Texas or something after this grad degree. Somewhere still in the beautiful United States but where people don’t mind giving each other space and respecting each other’s autonomy and not tryna be intrusive into the lives of others. Life is so short as is and I was vaccinated 4 months ago I was ready to be done with this shit 4 months ago yet we are here almost approaching 1.5 years of living in hysteria. 1.5 years man that’s a lotta time to dictate to people how to live.</p>

        <p>On Sunday I saw 2 dads (not related) biking without masks and their 2 sons, around 5-6 biking with masks on. It was 92°, noon. My DOG was panting. Anyway.... I called them out. I said “hey.... it’s a hot day out huh? Pretty messed up they’re wearing them and you’re not!” The one said “oh we’re vaccinated”..... I don’t think he knew what I was saying or he was playing dumb. I just repeated “it’s a hot day out.” </p>
<p>Ugh.... I don’t know what came over me but I just felt like I had to say something. I don’t know what kind of man does that to their kid. </p>
<p>My friends were like “you’re so iconic ty for standing up for the kids” and my husband said “you should be on a no fly list, you’re a lunatic.”😂 but of course he agreed with the sentiment.</p>

        <p>Hopefully at least a negative pcr (and likely quarantine which adds time to trip) will be ok as alternative but since this is globalist agenda and push for vaxx ids well not looking good for international travel at least.</p>

        <p>I would be hesitant to even take a pcr test. Isnt that the nose swab test where they shove a swab way back to the brain/nasal plate? I watched a video a while back of a lady who had the test and shortly after she felt severely ill. She had never experienced this issue before in all her travels until they nose swabbed her.</p>

        <p>I'm hopeful a negative PCR test will still be an option to allow non-vaccinated people to travel. No reason why it shouldn't. It's an easy way for labs to make a bit of cash too since they charge a lot of money for it. </p>
<p>But unfortunately i'm sure for the next couple of years at least either the vaccine or a negative test will be required. I am hopeful neither will be required though as time goes on and COVID becomes endemic and generic like most other illnesses.</p>

        <p>Do you need a PCR test upon arrival too? I thought it was just for departure? </p>
<p>But in any case, as much as countries have dissolved into blatant tyranny with this pandemic, I would have a hard time imagining them holding you hostage unless you get the vaccine. At worst I could see them quarantining you somewhere with the option to get vaccinated while you quarantine.</p>

        <p>100%!!! ive been thinking this since everything started, first you’ll need it to leave the country, and eventually it’ll just be to go on a plane in general. this whole thing has me questioning if im just paranoid and been inside too long, or if how im thinking makes sense and it’s everybody else who’s out of it. I don’t know, people are really just desperate to feel ok again so vaccines have taken off really quickly, so I feel like within the year it’s going to be accepted to need the vaccine to travel.</p>

        <p>Tentative good news on the ground.</p>
<p>At my workplace, it's now allowed to go mask-free if you've been vaccinated. But only about 10% of the workers are doing that. So either 4 out of 5 vaccinated employees are wearing masks by choice, or less than half have gotten the frankenshots. Given how much most people hate the masks, it's probably just low vaccine uptake.</p>
<p>I suspecting that the poll numbers and counts of how many people have gotten it in the USA are inflated, and a LOT more are saying "no thanks" or "not now, maybe later" than is being reported.</p>
<p>Low uptake means it's going to be harder to punish and discriminate against the people who declined. They can push out 10-15% of the workforce or make their job miserable, but you can't really do that to 60% without fucking yourself over in the process.</p>

        <p>Just a little report from a medium-sized democrat Texas city (&lt; 1M population):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>still see a lot of masks on people walking around, in parks, at the gas station.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circle K (formerly Valero, a gas/convenience store chain with heavy presence here) has masks optional signs on their doors, no issues or fearful looks going in there without one. The sign claims vaccinated employees don't have to wear masks, but thus far I haven't seen a single employee without one. Maybe the managers still won't allow it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>saw a group of 5-6 walking into a Whataburger without masks. I haven't tried to eat indoors there lately but I wouldn't be surprised if they simply took the signs down (vs. saying anything about being vaccinated)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a popular Mexican restaurant here simply took the signs down. All employees still required to wear them, however.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my wife said she was the only one in Walmart today without a mask, even though they're optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the local water parks are open for the summer. I watched some news stories about them, and none made a single mention of COVID / masking protocols / vaccine requirements / etc. Video footage showed people enjoying themselves normally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm cautiously optimistic for the summer at least, but not getting my hopes up unduly for fall/winter. I believe that people will be slow to remove the masks, but once a critical mass (maybe 10%?) stop wearing them, they will evaporate as quickly as they came into existence. Fingers crossed!</p>

        <p>In NJ we just got our mask mandate lifted on Friday. I went to two malls Friday and I would say 80-90% of people were still wearing fucking masks. I couldn’t fucking believe it. We are given our freedom back but people prefer to be masked up and locked down for some reason. We will never get back to normal with these people.</p>

        <p>You went the same day it was announced and you’re upset people still had their mask on? What?!</p>
<p>It’s going to take a while.  You know it took about 1-2 years for people to discard masks during the first pandemic in the US, right?  Even when they weren’t required, some people still wore them out of habit or feeling safer.  As someone else said, “patience.”  </p>
<p>Besides, you went the same day it was announced and not everyone watches the news or is bothered by (or consumed by) wearing masks…  </p>
<p>And it will take a while for businesses to update their policies since it comes from their headquarters and goes down to each store.  And if there aren’t signs saying “No masks required” then why are you upset with people wearing masks? They’ve been told to for over a year now.</p>
<p>Honestly, just be happy you can take yours off and maybe inform others of the new guidance. No need to be upset.</p>

        <p>lately I’ve been getting into more and more arguments with people about masks on a daily basis and it’s wearing on me and my family. I’m getting to the point where I’m going to start throwing hands with these lockdown lovers. My only wish is freedom for my family. I don’t care what anyone else does, they can wear masks for the rest of their damn lives if they want. What are you all doing to keep sane?</p>

        <p>Almost every time I walk into any store, any restaurant, any place of business I get swarmed by the mask police. Sometimes I ignore it and pretend I don’t hear them, they follow me until I either say something to them or I leave. At Costco the other day, I went with my wife and one of the managers came up to me and got in my face for not wearing a mask. It took all of my strength to not punch him in the throat. I’m not a violent person, but this is just pushing me over the edge and I don’t want to get in trouble for beating a snowflakes ass.</p>

        <p>Well, there's something to be said for not going out of your way to stir shit up on purpose. You clearly live somewhere where normal breathing is still considered so far out of the range of acceptable behavior that you're being confronted.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be more constructive to try to network with like-minded people and maybe go out in a group together to shop, to lessen the likelihood of an individual confrontation? Are you under a statewide / citywide mask mandate still? (Because I thought Costco was letting people do whatever nationwide, if you're in the US)</p>
<p>Whatever the case, if it's putting you into a rage you're just setting yourself up for a bad situation / legal troubles. It's really not worth it.</p>

        <p>Things will get better. Do you live in the US? Most red states and most of the South is back to normal, or as close to normal as you might hope for. You should consider moving if it's affecting you that badly. Remember, you've made it this far--you have the strength to continue on!</p>

        <p>No, germany. While we might not have to harshes restrictions of the world, when it comes to length of the restrictions, being in lockdown for pretty much 8 months, vaccination-cohersion-tactics and propaganda we are pretty much the worst in europe, if not the world. I cant go to the gym without getting tested or do anything else than the supermarket for that matter and will stay like this forever because everybody goes along and most people I know who said they wouldnt get the vaxx are taking it now bc they belive it will end. I'm not really capable to move to another country I dont really belive that anyone will be spared anywhere imo, if germany falls all of europe will too. i was a bit drunk and over-emotional so i deleted my post. thank you.</p>

        <p>I wish I could be more helpful but it sounds like it automatically adds Amazon Sidewalk to your account on the 8th.  I’m guessing you’ll be able to follow the steps to opt-out that day which should show up in your settings then.</p>

        <p>This coming Wednesday, mask mandates will be removed in my state. </p>
<p>I’m excited, but I can’t lie I’m a little nervous too. Not of catching covid, but I’ve just became so accustomed to wearing a mask that I’m a little nervous to not wear one at work anymore? Like, I’m afraid of making “rude” facial expressions, showing my emotions on my face etc. It’s honestly very weird and a little scary how accustomed to mask wearing I’ve became - and I’m not even a doomer. Makes me wonder, if I’m a little nervous myself, I can only imagine how much doomers are freaking out. I do believe masks have basically become adult security blankets at this point. It’s all so, so odd.</p>

<p>(There are plenty of old articles about his connection to pushing vaccines, but a single tweet referring to "next year" sounds apocryphal)</p>
<p>This 2019 article is kind of along similar lines:</p>
<p>https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/17/bill-gates-says-this-is-the-best-investment-he-has-ever-made.html</p>
<p>Here's his direct tweet of a WSJ article he wrote which was the source of that article:</p>

        <p>It also hasn't gotten a whole lot of traction though. I checked it about 24 hours ago and the amount of signatures has barely changed. Just 1.2K bootlickers who took 2 seconds to unglue their eyes from CNN and CBC to sign a petition as quickly as they could so they can get back to their brainwashing therapy lol.</p>

they had the mask sign, etc, etc.<br>
me and 2 other family members were there.<br>
we smiled at a few people who gave us glares.</p>
<p>came across a few people not masking too.<br>
we got what we needed, went through self checkout and left.<br>
had a fantastic bbq!<br>
nobody tried to stop us.  </p>
<p>tired of seeing all these masks on peoples otherwise lovely faces, dividing the people.<br>
really hope enough people start to just ditch the masks that we outnumber the crazies.<br>
stay strong everyone, stay free.<br>

        <p>I’ve been going maskless everywhere feels amazing. Last night I went to pick something up at a friend of a friends house and her husband was like don’t worry I’m vaccinated! </p>
<p>I normally hang out with cool people who have been not worried this whole time so I was taken aback. I am so not ready for people to say this all the time.</p>

        <p>The curfew is lifted on Friday, I'm so happy I dont have to ration my time on my weekends to do errands. My shifts are often 11 to 9 or 2/3 to 10. Of course I can do my shopping during the day on the days I start later but sometimes I am exhausted and the past 2 - 3 weeks I've been working nearly 40 hours and have nothing going for me. I'm glad i can finally buy food after work. Also the reopening of the terrasses and dining rooms in my city is great but annoying for me because i work in a restaurant and it's extra work on top of the insane amount of uber eats. I don't want them to close again because that's more work putting shit away</p>

        <p>Could just be expectation/fear/paranoia (let's not discount how much of "COVID" was just people making themselves sick from watching the news and psychologically amplifying the slightest cold symptom).</p>
<p>That said, if disrupting human reproduction was the goal, it would make sense to deploy something that would work on everybody, whether they got the shot or not. Really not much we can do about that at this point.</p>

        <p>One thing I never understood is, if the mask is supposed to prevent things coming in throw the mask it won’t flow out the same, so how is it that you get 100% normal breathing flow wearing a mask? I remember all these people like I can breath with mask on, but the examples were of extremely fit people probably 4-6% body fat max none were of the normal person trying to do something.</p>

        <p>Fatty here. Wore a double mask for six hours straight volunteering to give covid-19 vaccines. Can confirm: did not die, or even pass out.</p>
<p>Also note the number of nurses and doctors wearing masks during long surgeries, or painters painting for an entire day with few breaks, and surprisingly few deaths by asphyxiation. (Kidding - no one dies from suffocation because they wore a surgical mask.)</p>

This whole cancel culture, economic bullshit, mass surveillance, mass censorship, massive opression against any protest.

        <p>I have a question about asymptomatic. We all know asymptomatic spread is extremely rare and stupid. But the one thing covid fanatics who aren’t stupid will then bring up is PRESYMPTOMATIC spread. </p>
<p>for me, I literally don’t care bc it’s just a virus and people are gonna either die or not (99.9% etc lmao) BUT what would you say to them? How common is presymptomatic spread? </p>
<p>Like when you get a stomach bug it is often before you show symptoms that you spread it. So is there anything on this difference for covid?</p>

        <p>This is my question as well.</p>
<p>It's my understanding that children's immune system is effective at fighting off COVID-19 without any help.  That's why we see less infection and less severe disease/death in children.</p>
<p>Older folks and those with pre-existing conditions aren't as lucky, so they need a vaccine to help train their immune system.  </p>
<p>It seems to me, just an idiot typing away in his basement, that these two categories are the same in the end:  You have a strong immune system or you might need some extra help (a vaccine) to get a strong immune system.</p>
<p>It also seems like both can spread COVID, it's just less likely because your immune system is able to fight off the disease therefore making the person have a low viral load in the first place.</p>
<p>So, my question is:  Why force children to get the vaccine?  Especially one that is based on technology never widely released before to the general public?  We don't know the long term safety effects, and the kids will have to be the ones that live with them the longest.  Which seems to me to be ethically problematic.</p>

        <p>Yes! That’s my biggest concern with the vaccine for anyone under 50 really. I am 30 - hopefully will live another 50 years, I would really rather just have natural immunity and not take this shot every year. I don’t think that’s a crime!! Even more so for my kiddos.</p>

        <p>&rt;Presymptomatic transmission accounted for &rt;75% of all transmissions to OCs in the cohort<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In conclusion, our study suggests that asymptomatic cases are unlikely to contribute substantially to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 cases should be detected and managed early to quarantine close contacts immediately and prevent presymptomatic transmissions.</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article</a> </p>
<p>It is like a stomach bug and is "smart enough" to spread a few days before you start having symptoms. This study says that the 75% number is weird and usually is way less. Most of the Covid spread is from symptomatic folks. </p>
<p>The whole government campaign of making quarantine healthy people, ruining the economy while symptomatic people goes to work as they can't afford staying home is just stupidity. </p>
<p>We should offer money to symptomatic folks to self isolate properly.</p>

        <p>MARK OF THE BEAST Only through electronic money can the "mark of the beast system" be brought in for total control of "buying and selling". Do not fall for this people! Bitcoin + microchip / nano-chipping = Mark of the beast! Revelation 13:15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. 16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. Anyone who buys into it will burn with satan: Revelation 19:20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. Meaning of the 666 Most people do not know that the Greek numbers carry characters. For 600, it is Ki (to insert), 60 is Zi (to punch in) and for 6 it is Stigma (to pierce the skin). Whatever this mark is, it will involve money (electronic) and inserting something forcefully under the skin. Ever watch a microchip being inserted? They really punch that thing in! "Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "if anyone worship the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name" (Revelation 14:9-11). Christian people! ...if you buy into electronic money now, then it makes it easier for evil to do away with cash sooner. I want to stay in cash...it is how I pay for everything, but as more get sucked into this cashless system...it is going to make it much harder for those who will not use it!!!!</p>

        <p>Perhaps my earlier post (and its comments) of an Etsy seller's products, via screen shot, was not allowed, as I was given no notice/reason for its removal. Let's try again. So here's one of the stories regarding her products, announcing who is vaxxed, <em>etc</em>.</p>

<p>Are you anti-covid stuff or anti-vax overall?</p>
<p>I thought this sub stood apart from being antivax in general, but post history would say otherwise.</p>

"Antivax overall"<br>
"Anticovax only"<br>
"Pro vax" or something</p>

        <p>Anti-lockdown, Anti forced vax (coercion or not being able to get a job or travel counts as "forced" by the way). Anti forced experimental vax, Anti forced medical procedures, anti mRNA vax that uses your own cells to generate a deleterious spike protein. Anti being forced to do things and being controlled.</p>
<p>On the flip side, before covid I was pro vax and I took many vaccines for travel that I wanted to take (not required).</p>

        <p>I'm anti covid vax out of spite and anti extra NJ requirements vaccinations. They mandate a bunch of vaccines in this state that should not be necessary. Like the meningitis B vaccine they mandated last year. 4,000 cases and 500 deaths nationally and they require it for 1.35 million NJ students? Its just them creating billable hours for big pharma and the hospitals.</p>

        <p>Pro medical freedom. People should make their own choice without being pressured, manipulated, or forced into it, and there should be no mandates whatsoever. What vaccines people get is a private health decision and nobody's business but them and their doctor, and you're just begging for corrupt behavior when you legally require people to use specific products and generate business for the manufacturer.</p>

        <p>Skeptical of most vaxxes. Just look at how the amount of required childhood vaxxes has skyrocketed in the past 20-30 years. I think the differences within this sub come from some of us not trusting the government or big pharma for a long time vs. those who have just recently become critical and are only questioning the COVID narrative and not everything yet.</p>

        <p>PS: If you (or anyone who sees this) ever needs to prove all the injuries/deaths, Pastor JD Farag gave a wrenching Prophecy Update today. Last week he called for emails and got over 2000. He read about a couple dozen excerpts and was all choked up by the time he was done. So was I.</p>
<p>My first emotion was anger at them for being so "stupid". He covered that too. www.jdfarag.org  Don't know if today's is uploaded to the on-demand page yet as it's still morning in Hawaii. But it'll be there tonight or tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Went to a LGBT mixer here in California the other day (young liberal big city crowd). Probably a good 30 of us in a relatively small parking lot.</p>
<p>No social distancing.</p>
<p>Open food and drinks.</p>
<p>Probably about 80% of people masked at any given time. But we were masked off for eating and drinking. Maybe one or two people didn't have a mask at all. Not sure.</p>
<p>Guessing the majority of us were vaccinated.</p>
<p>Went to give my friend a hug goodbye and they got a little nervous for a second, but then realized it was alright because we were both vaccinated.</p>
<p>Definitely appreciating this gradual return to normalcy.</p>

<p>So, if one of you weren't vaccinated, that hug wouldn't have happened? And this is supposed to represent a "return to normalcy"?</p>
<p>You shouldn't appreciate another sign of a successful propaganda campaign.</p>

        <p>Not sure. </p>
<p>I've been a little half-assed at times over COVID safety. </p>
<p>I tried to do my part. Definitely never minded wearing a mask (always thought wrap around masks look really cool, and will probably continue to wear one as a general fashion accessory). Didn't mind staying inside <em>most</em> of the time. </p>
<p>But when it comes to the important stuff like personal intimacy, I'm pretty willing to cut corners a bit.</p>

        <p>Hmmm. Yeah cut corners would mean possibly hugging an unvaccinated person?!  You see thats not returning to “normalcy”. Thats sad. And youre eating up the medias fearmongering divisive unscientific bs - sorry to say.  Youre vaccinated after all - it shouldnt matter!!</p>

        <p>Hmmmm - so sick until proven not sick is how you consider the unvaxxed i guess?  If the vaccines work - you do have yours apparently - and someone is not symptomatic what the heck is the problem?!  O yeah the media telling you what to think about unvaccinated people. Wake up to reality or this is going to go full hitler land before you know it.  Happened to see hoda and jenna bush had a social etiquette expert on discussing how to handle social invites and parties etc and making sure all of vaxxed status. Use your feelings as “excuse”. Well feelings are informed by the shit like that they talk about on tv etc. certainly not the science.</p>

        <p>Hopefully someday soon there wont be categories of vaxxed vs unvaxxed. Thats the point. You got a vaccine, your choice, youre good. Advice - stop watching cnn nbc etc etc etc.  feeds the fear, division and tyrrany!</p>

<p>That's sad tbh. Goes to show how traumatized people are from this shit. </p>
<p>I don't get why hugs were ever verboten tbh. Your mouth and nose are facing away from the other person when hugging. Hugs are probably the safest form of human interaction.</p>

        <p>Yes because lockdowns and masks don't work. It's a seasonal respiratory virus and we can't influence when and how it triggers. This whole circus has had no benefit at all. It's not based on science. It's based on fear. </p>
<p>I can sort of understand trying some unproven measures in case of a real emergency which you could argue the peak of the two spikes most western countries faced were. Maintaining these measures in the fucking summer is absolute insanity. </p>
<p>We should have never done anything besides protecting those at risk. We should only vaccinate those at risk if they want to with a full understanding of the risks.</p>
<p>At the moment there is hardly any potential spread and there is no danger as we are not in the viral season. This isn't rocket science. All you need to do to avoid the virus is not travel to India and south asia where they are having their first viral surge.</p>

        <p>euroMOMO. Other historical mortality data. A lack of evidence for lockdowns. Real world RCT's like the Denmark mask study and previous research on masks showing no real world impact on the spread of respiratory virusses and thorough observational data showing no effect of masks or lockdowns.</p>
<p>Observational studies on covid measures that show a positive effect don't take the natural viral pattern into account and most countries introduced measures just after a viral spike which explains the entirety of the observed effect. It's obvious when you compare regions in a similar viral phase with different measures that there is no difference. </p>
<p>It's the same with the current vaccine drive. It's the end of the viral season but everyone ignores it and attributes the decline in virus impact to vaccines instead of recognizing the natural viral pattern. Countries in a similar phase who are barely vaccinating their population are doing just as well.</p>
<p>Currently India and serrounding countries are in a different phase and experiencing their first real viral spike so all the attention is there to keep people scared.</p>

        <p>Viral triggers are complex. The first spike wasn't as large and wasn't at the typical time but late and cut short by summer which might have allowed a bump out of season. The first normal seasonal trigger is more obvious and similar for most western countries. It's not unusual to have a smaller rise before the season.</p>

        <p>I already go about life like I did prior to the pandemic, as much as I can. I'm not sick and therefore already won't spread coronavirus. We no longer have to wear masks in most places because the right people at the CDC decided to say masks shouldn't be required for vaccinated people, despite this having been known for months and no new information being discovered that could have informed this decision. It just became politically untenable to keep the ridiculous restrictions in place.</p>

        <p>Masks work in when doing mechanistic studies based on assumptions of how covid spreads and when looking at observational data confounded by masks being introduced after the peak of the first viral spike. </p>
<p>Masks have no effect when looking at large RCTs on real world spread and more thorough observational studies.</p>
<p>There is a reason everyone recommended against masks at the beginning and there is a reason everyone recommending masks currently admits that it's based on the weakest quality of evidence. Actually it's a farce.</p>

        <p>You want me to do a literature review for you or can I just be lazy like most redditors and link a single study that proves my point?</p>
<p>If I were lazy I'd probably link the Danish mask study. Obviously not conclusive on it's own but unless I'm getting paid I'm not going to dig up all the relevant studies for you.</p>
<p>Btw. Most studies that show that masks "work" are either mechanistic studies that make assumptions on how their outcomes like catching droplets translates to real world spread or low quality observational studies that are confounded by the introduction of mask measures right after the natural peak of a viral spike.</p>

        <p>My dude what other proof of working can there be besides no effect? It didn't show masks might work, it showed no effect.</p>
<p>If the vast majority of studies show no effect the obvious conclusion is they don't work. Even the organisations recommending masks plainly say their recommendation is based on the lowest quality of evidence. </p>
<p>I didn't just read six studies (which would still mean I understand six more studies than you). I've taken an overview of the available evidence on mask (from which the concensus before covid was that they don't work as illustrated by the initial recommendations against masks) and have read the studies used as the basis for the mask recommendations in detail and found them lacking as mentioned.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about the effectiveness of masks I suggest you dig in yourself with an open mind. It's not hard to navigate pubmed and get a decent overview in a day or so.</p>

        <p>From the Danish article: “The findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”</p>
<p>So, are they experts and we should listen to their claims?</p>
<p>Along with that, the confidence interval was heavily slanted towards a reduction in infection rate. They can’t make a statistically significant claim because they didn’t test enough people and didn’t really set up a good control. IMO, a poorly run experiment.</p>
<p>Also, you keep claiming that the vast majority of studies don’t support masks, but earlier you said you read six studies that do support masks as an effective tool. To me, 6/7 seems like the vast majority.</p>
<p>Also, please link me one of these six studies you read. Also, how did you find this “overview” of available evidence? What were your sources other than the papers?</p>

        <p>The findings can't be used to say that because the research they did can't answer that question. That's blatantly obvious. No RCT has been done that can ask that question. The research was perfectly fine to answer their hypothesis and was large enough to show a clinically significant effect of masks if it was there.</p>
<p>I don't keep a catalogue of all the papers I read that relate to my field. I'm not going to spend hours looking up those studies again. I'm not your personal research assistant. Show some respect for my time and learn to do your own research.</p>

        <p>We need less radical change. When the virus will be mostly eradicate mask won't be necessary. So no mask for the end of time, BUT we are still in the middle of a pandemic that can be eradicated before it become a recurrent thing that will kill every year like the flu. I would prefer wear a mask for a few months than not having one and seeing this shit kill more and more every year. Yes the mask and lockdown are frustrating when most people dont see the effect of this virus but it's a little price to pay for saving thousands/hundred of thousands people that can't always be vaccinated/be fully protected. </p>
<p>I don't expect people to change but I juste thing it's the right thing to do. We need to stop fighting for yes or no it will be over soon. The more people follow the rules , the sooner they will be removed.</p>

        <p>The fact that governments around the world are correlating openings with being vaccinated is very disturbing. All for a virus that has survival rate of 99.97%. Why is your (our) government trying so hard to force these vaccinations on to people. Look behind the curtain to see the real motive. </p>
<p>Many people don’t realize the full scope and ramifications of these COVID 19 gene therapy vaccines. It’s synthetic DNA being injected into your cells stimulating the production of antigens for spike proteins. Everyone that is getting this is essentially signing up to be a human Guinea pig.</p>
