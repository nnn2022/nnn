    <strong>This society we live in just makes me feel empty</strong>
    <p><p>*this is going to be a long read as I am writing about how this pandemic and society has affected me on a mental health level*</p>
<p>You know before all of this pandemic life was pretty "simple". Simple I mean in terms of being able to go through school, figure out your career, pursue that career and then be able to get a place. Especially getting to make friends or even meet your lover along the way.</p>
<p>I look at how our society is now and I just struggle with it. You know worrying if my skin color is going to get someone offended or angry at me. Worrying if the next time I am in trouble or someone else I know gets in trouble if I'll be able to get cops involved to help, without them being more concerned if I have a mask on. That I'll eventually get into a confrontation with someone over not wearing a mask when I really just don't want to. Having to build up a social group again. Waking up every day more worried about getting the right job and where I am going to live over my own happiness.</p>
<p>I know other people will say I did the right thing. Doing what I thought was right from what people told me was right to do. By masking up and staying away from people. It really did make me feel like I wasn't being "part of the problem". Yet it toke away any potential progress I could have been making with my life. Now I have to make that progress and improve my life when I don't even want to be part of what's going on within the world we live in. Going from being able to do almost anything you wanted to having that restricted really hurt.</p>
<p>People tell me I should be happy things are opening up again. That I can go out and do what I used to like doing again. Yet because there was so much time that went on where I couldn't do anything it really brought me down. To the point where I only make sure I have enough motivation to go to work and see how my family or girlfriend are doing. It's just so hard trying to find joy in things. To all of you who still want mask mandates and isolation please just fuck off. People like to say "it's just a mask" but oooooh buddy buddy buddy it's so much more than that.</p>
<p>Like these people don't realize you couldn't go out and do anything right? Even if you wore your mask? There were no concerts, events, movie theaters, friends and family were to concerned over Covid, etc. Now they care about how your life is going and want you to succeed when you've been stuck in a mental hell hole for more than a year? After constantly being told you couldn't do this or that and seeing closed signs everywhere. It almost just makes me feel defeated in a way.</p>
<p>That no matter how much of a social life you gain. Or how much progress you make with your career. The fact it could be stopped or even got rid of by something out of your control does a number on your mental health. I know there are people who can bounce back from that. I'm sure people have already or they are making steps to get things in order again. For me though it doesn't feel that way. Then as I try to make it back into society it's like why bother?</p>
<p>For being a white male I just feel completely awful. Could just be over time that the media has portrayed us all out to be racist assholes. Just like how the media has tried to portray all cops being awful when there are still some good ones out there. Instead of feeling like I can go out and make a friend I feel like I have to watch my back. That I have to be careful or what I say because fuck it I am sure just saying "Hi" will get someone triggered. I mean it's just unbelievable what people get upset about these days.</p>
<p>I just look around and after seeing what this pandemic has done to people I just feel so defeated. I just wish I could get better. That one day I can get passed my mental health issues and enjoy life again. I just don't know when that will be or if I can even fully enjoy life anymore after what was happened.</p></p>

        <p>The ruling class/oligarchs  hate us. They see us as useless eaters that's lived passed our time of usefulness. The feeling of community and family has been ripped away from many and replaced with cold digital screens and race based diversionary theories. </p>
<p>We can't have freedom without speaking truth to power no matter the cost, speak with bravery from you're heart and don't be cowed. Find like-minded people, seek them out.</p>
<p>We are at a global point of major deceit and they want you numb and defeated, do not give them the fucking satisfaction. Shine and smile in the face of the slings and arrows and they will burn from you're brightness.</p>

        <p>We "white males" are the target of a genocidal extinction campaign because we are already the answer to all our questions. The oligarchy that is attacking us fears us because our latent talents and strengths can and will change the world. We can create meaning.</p>
<p>How I know this? I have seen the anemic oligarchs. They were white males before they turned into metaphorical anti-human vampires.</p>
<p>Today, it is up to us to take on the burden of history and usher in a new age just as it has always been throughout history: As one power system wanes, a new one emerges.</p>
<p>You know that myth of Saturn eating his children? It reflects this selfish desire to consume the new in order to sustain the old. But duty is to eventually let go and become one with nature.</p>
<p>You are not defeated, brother. You have already won, just be a man.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry that you have to go through this at such a young age, you should be so excited about the life ahead of you but I completely understand your struggles. Anybody with half a brain in their head would be feeling like you. You are here reading this board so you obviously know that it's not just a matter of taking the mask off and going back to normal. Most of us here realize that. The past year-and-a-half has done a number on everyone's Mental Health.</p>
<p>Try to take things in small increments, try to appreciate the little things. Have a conversation with a stranger, make eye contact and smile, I've been doing that lately and I can't believe the response I get. I take the mask off and I look directly at whoever I'm talking to and I smile I have a very warm welcoming facial expression. People immediately warm up. Anybody who is paranoid and afraid of me doesn't engage but I would say 95% of the people I encounter love having a conversation and it goes really well. You have to start dipping your toe back into life again. Bit by bit, just try. Tomorrow is not promised to any of us, you have to appreciate every minute you have. We don't know what's going to happen, but we have to try to still be humans, do human things enjoy life. Little things. I wish you the very best</p>

<p>Pfft I didn't choose shit. Then again, people didn't choose to be a part of Nazi Germany, or Stalin Soviet Union, or Mao China, or when all those Armenians/Africans got slaughtered.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing, multi-millennial agenda of careful population control through wars and medical tyranny. </p>

        <p>Our society may make you feel empty, but if you find the right community you can feel so much more! Find a group of like minded people, a church, a volunteer organization, something. I lived in a big city and felt alone and meaningless. Made a move to a smaller town and got involved in community organizations, invite our friends over more often, go out more often... there are wonderful people everywhere! We just need to find each other!</p>

        <p>A weak spirit is how the devil gets it. Trust me. Love life it’s a blessing. I’m not necessarily saying find Jesus but find something because something is coming. Remember to love nature and love other people</p>

        <p>Thanks everyone for taking the time to read what I said. I've been having these thoughts a lot lately over the current state of the world we live in. That after a long time of not being able to go out and enjoy life how it can really affect someone. That's what these "just wear a mask" people don't understand. I bet a lot of these folks that promote that bs don't go out. When we were in that just only go to work and go home phase for way longer than two weeks it takes a huge toll on you.</p>

        <p>This post wasn't just to entertain you.  It just was meant for me to vent and try to heal from all the damage this pandemic has done. Just because you may not feel the way I do doesn't mean people aren't suffering mentally.  So just knock it off troll. Just please?</p>
