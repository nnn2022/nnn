        <p>This clown is getting Canada to become a welfare state... We use the same voting machines everywhere in Canada as the same ones that rigged and stole the election from Trump in the states.</p>
<p>No use in voting, the system will rig it to the liberals next election. In BC we had a land slide win of the far left, never happened before and under no circumstances should it ever happen... Freeland is gonna be the next liberal leader and she's the one enacting the "green economic plan" of this sell out.</p>
<p>Eventually it will have be reversed years down the road, when it'll be clearlyyyyy obvious to everyone that the vast majority are in poverty and inflation went through the roof with non stop socialism. This clown made it illegal to work for many industries, then turned around and is paying those same people 1800 a month to stay home and not produce. He's on his 2nd 6 months of tax free money, and talks about being permanent will happen in 2021.</p>
<p>I don't see how we can stop Canada from becoming a welfare state, that's his goal and plan for this once great country... We can't even vote out his ideology, the machines used to count votes are from Smartmatic and Dominion, they will rig the next election in Canada like they have before. The rot is very very deep folks.</p>

        <p>Fellow Canadian here, this country has really gone down the shitter since he took charge. I agree with everything you said. I don't see a peaceful way out of this.</p>

        <p>He's been a puppet to moment he got in... He installed a Minister of Environment and Climate Change the day he got in at end of 2015. Climate change is almost as big of a hoax then covid 1984.</p>

<p>We haven't gone down the shitter that much yet, but we are well on our way... I'm doing good and so are many others, but the general direction of the ship is headed for disaster.</p>
<p>Depends on you're career and business path, but generally speaking, the majority of Canadians will suffer economically within the next few years, there's just no way around it. He's very anti business, and very much in favour of a welfare state, he's literally out of touch with reality... He doesn't look or act like he has a lack of empathy, so how does he sleep at night? Maybe that's why his wife left him. She couldn't handle the monster and sellout he'd become.</p>

        <p>He is PRAYING Trump doesnt uncover fraud. The US was way more business friendly than Canada these past four years, why would a business stay here when the US is so much easier to work in. </p>
<p>I hate his pathetic condescending attitude too. Our issue is the education system is extremely liberal and is churning out tons of voters who vote liberal blindly.</p>

        <p>Liberals aren't "liberal" anymore... They moved from the center to the far left since 2019.</p>
<p>When a far left political group like the NDP agree and back up you're economic plan, you know you went off the deep end. It's the equivalent of Bernie Sanders endorsing Trudeau economic agenda for Canada. He's got the green light for anything due to NDP fully backing him in making Canada a welfare state and socialist... The push back will come in 5-10 years when Canadians will be told that private property rights in Canada are getting abolished, or severely impacted.</p>
<p>I believe the system might fall apart before that tho, due to massive push back against the lockdowns/vaccines hoax that is already starting to happen and seems to be getting bigger by the month.</p>

        <p>Didn't like a million Canadians die fighting against communism in just the past 100 years? And this clown really has the gall to try to turn the country into a communist state when he wouldn't even be here without the sacrifice of the previous generations. Great leader you guys picked.</p>
