    <strong>Lots of folks who are cheering the lock down are lazy and would welcome UBI.</strong>
    <p><p>That's what you guys don't get, they have no problem staying home and have daddy government provide for them (which daddy government clearly haven't done), where other people have no problem going out and trying to provide for their families.</p>
<p>I would rather risk the 99.999999% survival rate and be able to take care of my family, than depend on the government. When in history has anyone looked back and think, boy the government really handled that tragedy well, well the government really stepped up and took care of those people.</p>
<p>The virus is real, however based on the data, I have no problem going out and facing the risk, while taking proper precautions. People act like if you caught Corona, that means you are  automatically dead. There are 11 million people with covid, back in April and May didn't they predict millions of people would be dead if the virus spread this much (clearly that haven't happened). Donald Jr caught covid, everybody is yelling "I told you covid is real.. Hahahhah.. Sucks to be him.. ", no one is pointing out the fact he has covid and is fine. </p>
<p>Every day, it's proven the virus is not as bad as it was predicted, however everyday we move to more and more drastic measures and become more and more scared of the virus.</p>
<p>Bonus point, after millions of people don't die at Thanksgivings, what or when ( which holiday) will be the new doomsday event</p></p>

        <p>The government will never be there for you. They like to say there isn't any clean water in Flint Michigan, however these are the same people who want to hand over their livelihood  to the government. However, what we government skeptical people, fail to realize is this time is different, as we have a "new" democratic president and a black female VP, once they are sworn in, manna will fall from heaven and everything wrong will become right with the world.</p>

        <p>Most of them really want UBI and just like they have no ability to think critically about the virus, they have no ability to think critically about UBI.  UBI would just make the rich richer and the poor poorer.  I'm a landlord and if they pass UBI, the rent I charge is going up and eventually will go up by the same amount as UBI.  Housing prices will skyrocket and those who own houses can basically retire on their UBI while those who don't will be paying rent forever.  Anyone who supports this is dumb and short sighted, just like the coronavirus restrictions.</p>

        <p>I just bought a condo last week for that reason. I wasn't planning to purchase a property for at least 1 or 2 years but the recent development made me pull the trigger. Other than UBI, Trudeau and Biden said that they want to raise immigration levels exponentially meaning that rent prices will rise considerably (supply and demand).</p>

        <p>Not to blame all boomers but they had the best economy in the history of the world. The majority became wealthy and complacent thinking that government would take care of all economic issues. The bra burning, toxic, neofeminism movement started and schools became breeding grounds for socialism and communism right under their apathetic noses. Millennials grew up in a stew of cancel culture while their parents were still disillusioned with the idea of the nuclear family having a strong root in the social construct. Boomers are holding onto all their wealth, property, and high corporate positions with a death grip. Boomers won't retire and most of them will live easily into their 90s. Their workaholic, forever young, attitude is sucking up all the opportunities for the generations after them. This is justified to them by the small amount of money they donate to social programs. Thinking they are tipping the scales back to balance by giving poor people just enough money to scrape by is fueling the younger generations to push for socialism. The "pandemic" has caught a poorly educated young American off guard while paralyzing an older generation, that wants to live forever, with impending doom. A perfect storm undoubtedly brewed up by the very government sworn to uphold basic human rights all over the world.</p>

        <p>This. People on this sub blame millennials and zoomers for the lockdowns because that's what they see online, but every pro-lockdown person I know is a boomer or gen-xer. Not young, not old, middle-aged. They tell their children to get a job, but they won't give up theirs. Every job position that isn't folding boxes or flipping burgers requires however many years of experience, but lo and behold, you can't get job experience if no one will hire you because you have no job experience. They tell their children to move out, but they own all the houses and their children have no choice but to live paycheck-to-paycheck paying rent for somewhere that'll never be their own. I know many boomers are good people and many millennials are indeed lazy entitled little shits, but for fuck's sake, do you want my generation to take your jobs and houses by force? Is that what it'll take to prove we got gumption?</p>
