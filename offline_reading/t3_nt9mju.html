        <p>No more a fan of the injections when he promotes them than when Fauci (or anyone else) does.  It's still a global scale medical experiment and we're still basically laboratory rats.</p>

<p>I love Trump as a president and this is a talking point of his I am extremely against. Lots of people think Trump voters agree with everything he says and it’s simple not true. Some do but not even close to all.</p>

        <p>I think he mostly wanted everyone off his back, and the vaccine was a great way to get people to shut the fuck up. </p>
<p>I wouldn’t have gotten it either way, even if he would have won the election. But you know damn well democrats and doomers would have <em>absolutely</em> refused to get it, and there’d be news stories talkin shit about every single adverse effect we talk about. </p>
<p>But I digress. If you know anything about Trump, he never wants to be publicly seen as a loser or “less than,” so at this point it’s way too late to go back on his praise for his vaccine program so he shills it instead.</p>

        <p>Whats the problem, if they actually work it would be a genuine miracle.  20 years of work compressed into 1.</p>
<p>Although it makes you wonder why they haven't done this before, for diseases that are genuinely dangerous??? Or other problems that are just as deadly...</p>

        <p>Trump wasn’t duped. He was in on it from the beginning.</p>
<p>None of the data ever justified a national state of emergency or lockdowns. Ever. We knew back in March 2020 covid was basically equivalent to the flu. Even this being the case he could have ended lockdowns with executive orders, he could have heavily promoted ivermectin which is basically a covid cure all at any stage of the illness, he could have fired fauci in April. Etc. </p>
<p>But this was all about theatre and social engineering, which is what politics is anyways.</p>
<p>Trump had to oversee the destruction of the economy and the division of the nation last year because if a democrat was in office none of the Q anon psyop would have worked and gotten millions to sit on their hands “trusting the plan”.</p>
<p>It also was important to make trump look like public enemy number one so that now Biden is in office democrats unquestionably back anything and everything he says related to covid, perpetuating the cult.</p>
<p>Trump is without a doubt the greatest controlled opposition operation in history. Period.</p>

<p>I think they overdid it a bit.  Between the barrage of media flak and the extremist rhetoric from the so-called radical wing of the Democratic party it just didn't smell right.</p>
<p>One of my theories is that the 2016 election was thrown so no establishment politician from either party would sustain the political damage from what was going to happen.</p>

<p>This makes sense and goes hand in hand with trump being seen as some sort of hero/savior by the Qanon psyop and therefore many republicans would not oppose his actions during the totalitarian measures that were implemented last year. Including even supporting a totally unnecessary and unneeded vaccine because their god-king hero developed it.</p>
<p>Now that trump is gone, most republican establishment members can claim they were always against him (the lincoln project was heavily promoted for a reason) and the two party system can continue business as usual...now with the extra "new normal" flavor of tyranny.</p>
<p>Politicians are literally professional actors. They act in a way to sell themselves to the public to get elected. They act as if they are fighting their faux opposition (coke vs. pepsi). They act, act act.</p>
<p>It's all a show. But people still believe trump somehow was an exception!</p>

        <p>Some years ago I learned that one trick both parties play is, when there's legislation to be passed that is unpopular with the base, they'll figure out which members are most vulnerable to losing their seat in the next election and allow them the luxury of voting against what they have every intention of passing.</p>
<p>It was a real eye-opener for me- it gave some real insight into the process that unfolded after- like how Republicans always fell one or two votes short of repealing the ACA, or removing the individual mandate.  I think the Democrats played the same type of trickery on their base when Bush II was President and issues were wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the emerging surveillance state.</p>
<p>The agenda is the agenda and any establishment politician who campaigns on battling against the agenda is basically calling his or her base stupid.</p>
<p>They indeed act, act, act... in something I refer to as "Sheep Theater".</p>

        <p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You can even see it in how both “sides” have what appears to be one or two “honest” politicians on the national stage that will actually speak out against policies and appear to be for the people but they are either ignored or vilified by the media.</p>
<p>Tulsi gabbard and Ron Paul (now rand Paul) come to mind. I swear such politicians are allowed to exist on the premise that if NO ONE speaks out it would be too obvious the game is totally rigged against the peasantry. </p>
<p>The fact gabbard and paul exist on either side gives hope to the electorate that if somehow enough “honest” politicians are elected that the system can be reformed from within. Of course no such thing is possible.</p>
<p>I remember years ago someone caught on video the fact Ron Paul is a rosicrucian (secret society similar to freemasonry) and questioned him about it. He basically blew it off and not many people ever pointed out that supposedly the hero of the true right and libertarians that rails against the fed and actually calls out the government....is in a secret society just like much of the rest of Congress is....</p>
<p>Like George Carlin said —it’s all a giant club and you ain’t in it.</p>

        <p>Hearings and subcommittee panels supposedly "investigating" wrongdoing are quite insulting.  Trey Gowdy and his angry-sounding blustering about Hillary Clinton and Benghazi comes to mind.</p>
<p>I almost hate that act more than I do the Democrats- because for all they are doing they aren't going that extra mile to call me a moron by putting on the angry act to fool me into thinking I have a voice when in reality my job is to shut up and pay my taxes- oh, and participate in my own deception when voting day comes.</p>
<p>This is not how a respected base is treated.</p>

        <p>&rt;Trump, like everyone else, only knew what the "health experts" were telling him and nothing more. </p>
<p>The president of the united states certainly has better access to as much information as myself and many others who realized covid was on par with the flu back in march. The data we had from italy, china, and south korea at the time showed this conclusively.</p>
<p>Claiming he only knew what the "health experts" said is a complete cop out. If you want to continue to believe trump was on your side then by all means do so, but the evidence shows otherwise. </p>
<p>&rt;Nah, you're dreaming there, friend.</p>
<p>The irony.</p>

        <p>Anyone wonder how much $$$$$$$$$$$$ he gets for his advocating his juice? </p>
<p>Anyone rememberhow Liberals were all saying he'd be arrested as soon as he left Office? Funny that! Almost as funny as his own claims he'd "lock her up!" about his dear friend, Hillary Clinton.</p>
