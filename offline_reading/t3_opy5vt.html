    <strong>Professional organizations are really no different from Religious cults</strong>
    <p><p>Not sure why but while i was walking to get some supplies and started to think about some of the discussions here, i finally realized why many professionals are doing what they are doing now.</p>
<p>It has to start from when they are small, to a point they finally became a professional.</p>
<p>1.Most kids who study hard usually fall into 2 categories:1.Being forced by their parents 2.Being forced by their teachers. Whether they like it or not, happy or sad, they remained compliant, mainly out of fear. This forms the root of compliancy within their subconsciousness and the fear for higher authorities.</p>
<p>2.These kids get pressured into becoming useful professionals in the society, in order to achieve this, they have to study for their related subjects, do well in exams, alot of this relies on their mentors, so they have to pay upmost respect to them in order to get good grades and also recommendations. This made them even more compliant to the system.</p>
<p>3.Once they finished college, they are required to get their license to practice their professions, again, this involves having a mentor, and you have to go through assessments, tests to get a license.</p>
<p>4.After getting a license you are finally ready for real work, now you need to get a job, some recommendation letters would really help, provided that you were compliant and people were happy about you.</p>
<p>5.Now you got a job in a company, you have to follow your superiors, as they will appraise you performance which would affect your salary and promotions, and for some industry like medical, a small mistake would easily cost you your license. If you were compliant, people would be more forgiving. Especially when the industry is small and localized.</p>
<p>6.Now even if you got promoted, you still have to worry about keeping your position, and the only way to do so is follow the directives from higher ups. Even when you think you are near the top, there will always be someone above you.</p>
<p>With so much control a professional organization has towards their members, it is much worse than a religious cult, because you can still escape and find another cult to join, but more difficult if you already picked your profession.</p>
<p>So for example if Saint Fauci gave a top directives, all the members in the health care body will have to follow, the CEO of the medical companies will have to follow what the body says, all the directors, managers down to individual health care workers have to follow. And many of these doctors  don't really participate in R&amp;Ds, all their data they received are from reports &amp; journals, published by qualified personnel, they should never doubt the accuracy of these publishing. Just like Religious people should never question their god &amp; faith.</p>
<p>So for an old medication, a doctor maybe able to gather enough experience tru feedbacks from their patients, but for a new medicine, they have no choice but to trust the experts. Same goes for something relatively new like a Vaccine for Covid19. They are conditioned to trust the system, and the people above the system. Even if they had their own thoughts that might question the system they should just keep it to themselves.</p>
<p>Ever wonder even when it isn't about Covid19, most doctors have certain type of mentality and beliefs, that is hard for common people to understand? For example if a medication has statistically shown for some side effects from certain group of people, but no official documents or proves were provided, they would just shrug it off as nonsense, maybe the older ones who were part of the "Old System" would have different views but you can certainly see a pattern among the doctors coming from the same era. But then when it comes to other rare cases, they would just use statistic to shrug it off for example some folks had some rare infection they would just say it's nothing and send them home, just for them to die after a week.</p>
<p>Same thing can be seen among other professions. They seem to feel out of touch from reality like they are on another planet, probably why people see them in higher regards, coz we can't really understand them. Or maybe it's some sense of pride, because they made their way up to where they are now, whatever they believe in all these while, can't be wrong can it?</p></p>

        <p>You see the same in college. I recently graduated class of 2020 at a large University in California. Lots of future “leaders” in government and profession were around me daily. These people couldn’t carry a tune, get to classes on time by themselves, needed to rely on their parents for advice on everything (more following of orders), had never led a sports team or played for one (lacking leadership qualities badly). They were like little kids staring for directive from a late twenty’s TA or Liberal professor. They never question, debate, or anything. People would whip their heads back and forth as I would debate with my professors over theory or topic (isn’t that academia?) like they’d never seen such before. I actually had a fellow student come up to me after a lecture and say “That was really rude how you spoke to professor like that, it was misogynistic. Point period.” Lol because we debated anthropogenic climate change data recording methods (once again aren’t we supposed to question and doesn’t science say to question). Others would say to me, “I can’t believe you debate our professors like that....” like the professor word is God. The sad part is she was the head of some major campus organizations and students like her and that get the shoo ins to the top Law schools and business schools and the letters of recommendations from those professors. I was Political Science, so was the class debating anthropogenic climate change. Lol, no questions though? These are the soon to be leaders in our world, The Popular sorority girls that just go along and get a medical degree from UCLA (seen it) and now she just gets fed information to feed people as “truth” and “science” she couldn’t “function” without a Starbucks and “deserved” every weekend out getting shitfaced according to her snaps lmao. People suck.</p>

        <p>well, i disagree that those people are the future leaders, on the other hand i think students like you would be the leader because and the only problem would be if you pissed people off being a total non-compliance. future leaders would lead their sports teams, stand out and lead students for their agenda, or try to get themselves more credit, like becoming part of the student union core members, or lead members so they can use them as tool against the management, in a similar fashion union leaders are a team with their employers.</p>
<p>those no question asked students, will most likely become part of the "Zombie professionals". They will have no issue getting their license and getting a good job, and probably advance up towards the technical positions. Guys like Fauci would love them because they never question or doubt, whatever directives coming from the authorities will be like words coming out from the Pope.</p>
<p>This is why i felt professional organizations are no different from religious cults. They ultimately have the same goals and uses the same tactics on their members. Only difference is for religion most of the time you can escape, but for professions, you are most likely stuck with them as there's usually only 1 body in control of the said profession and it is difficult to switch profession when it requires years of studies and training just to become one.</p>

        <p>I think that’s the point. Our society has grown so irreligious that people intrinsically know that there is a need for some type of a “church“ because that’s what we were built for. I know not everyone’s going to agree with this, but I believe that we were created and built to worship God. When you know longer do that, there was a hole inside of you that you have to fill with something, and we feel that with politics and the cult of self, and professional organizations, and commodities. That’s why people on the left Are so frighteningly dogmatic, This is their religion</p>

        <p>Well yeah. The Alpha’s nowadays is rarely allowed into the field for that very reason. It’s why you see people like Bezos, Cook, all these lgbtq business leaders, all being planted into these positions because it pushes their agenda and furthers the submissive a in society to keep it going. The elites don’t wanna stand in a boardroom with the guy who can shovel a room full of coal in 5 seconds and built like John Henry in their face. They want submissive good little boys, girls, and whatevers to follow and push the narrative.</p>

        <p>while this thread was awaiting for approvals, i was checking around to see if there's any sub i could discuss about Psychology without the need to pull out research papers and scientific evidence to back up my open end discussions, the only sub i found was a small sub with 700 members, the rest of the subs only focus on journals &amp; researches, which really irks me for a forum as big as Reddit we have no place to discuss about psychology...</p>
<p>So it kinda gave me a further insight, like people on top level don't really want us average joes to participate in psychology discussions... by setting up subs that have tons of rules and red tapes limiting what people can post, and there is 1 sub that only allows 1 thread per day per user as part of antispam protocol... the sub has 30k members but barely moving...</p>
<p>Ok back to topic, now that i spent extra few minutes thinking about it, the main purpose of setting up professional bodies, is to ensure that we can groom any qualified individual so that they will think and react the same way no matter who you put in the same situation, so you would want them to follow the rules &amp; standards all the way, and not add in personal judgements unless you are highly qualified (for example if you are renowned in the industry), because while you are qualified as a professional, the organization do not trust you enough on your own thoughs and judgements.</p>
<p>Basically professionals are just not much different from soldiers who are trained to follow orders, respect the hierarchy and never question the authorities.</p>

        <p>Also to add that the high difficulties and redtapes to become a professional means that the general public are more respectful and trusting towards these professionals.</p>
<p>For example how would a normal person know much about Virology, or their own car? They would have to seek professional's advice like a doctor or mechanic, tell us what happens when you ask questions? Chances are you gonna get replies like trust me i am a professional if you don't believe me why are you here? As such the self inferior complex kicks in which explains why people are so trustful towards professionals. But with the age of internet, folks can actually google for some answers. The "I am no doctor so i don't know much about medical stuffs so i rather trust the doctor" mindset is so irresponsible, especially when you try to convince others to never question professional views.</p>
