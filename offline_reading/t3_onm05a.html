        <p>yep 99 percent of them had some serious illness that caused their death however covid just sped it up. it pretty unfortunate especially since i know someone who is 19 and has an illness where even a cold could kill her and as sad as it is for me to say life has to go on.</p>

        <p>Maybe because it's inconsequental but it's turned into overblown hype, loss of rights, small businesses adversely impacted, isolation psychological issues, things like that?  But hey let's let the deaths of people who have many medical issues that COVID just contributed to hustling them on to the next plane be our rallying point.  Look to me every death is a sad event but death is the price we pay for living life.  Frankly I'd rather LIVE my life than sit at home alone worried about catching the common cold.  </p>
<p>Okay fine be responsible.  If you have cold symptoms STAY YOUR ASS AT HOME.  That's been a mantra of mine for over 30 years.  As someone who has managed large departments I've always told my staff that if you have a fever or do not feel well STAY HOME.  I do not need you coming in and infecting your coworkers. </p>
<p>Let's do some simple math here.  Worker 1 wakes up.  Scratchy throat, lethargy, low grade fever.  Lays out for 2 to 3 days till they feel better.  Comes back to work.  I've lost 16 to 24 hours of productive time.  </p>
<p>Worker 1 comes to work.  Infects worker 2 to 4.  Now I've lost 124 hours of productive time.  I'd rather you stayed your ass at home and have, in the past when they had no 'sick' leave, just paid them anyway.  I don't need to lose my whole department for 2 to 3 days because you want to be a 'hero' or think you're so indispensable that I can't live without you for a few days.</p>
<p>This is NOT a pandemic.  It's a cold. That's all it is.  But let's get all riled up over it because well shit we need something to fight about instead of putting pressure on the 'elite' to effect positive change in all of our lives.  </p>
<p>Anybody notice gas prices lately?  Going up.  Anybody been talking about terrorism? Nope.  Trust me the terrorists haven't gone out of business.  No we're all so focused on this COVID crap that we're not paying attention to things that could affect us and our children 20 to 40 years down the road.  </p>
<p>Get over your fear and LIVE LIFE.  You only get one and if you spend it in the fetal position masked up and afraid of every new person you meet you've wasted yours.</p>

        <p>Both sides have used this virus for their own agenda.  I had it in March, other than loosing my sense of smell for 2 weeks it was a pretty mild ordeal for me.  Couple months later I’m having trouble taking in deep breaths, it’s scaring the shit out of me.</p>
<p>Fuck both sides of the political spectrum, they don’t give a fuck about us.  They both serve corporate overlords and not the people who voted them in. </p>

        <p>The thing is ... our whole history is a lie :D Not only WW2, but everything. History has been written by those that won the wars. Therefor, it's only propaganda from one side we get ...<br>
Just look at the ppl around you, how many lie about their lives ... scale that nationwide, and there you go. All big talks and heavy statements, but most likely all false, or very different to reality ... It's a common human behavior.</p>

        <p>&rt;So you deny the Holocaust happened?</p>
<p>In my country, denying in public the holocaust can make you end up in jail. I ve always questioned, why? No one puts flat earthers in jail, no one puts vegans in jail, no one puts any "conspirationist" in prison. But, if you deny the holocaust in any way ... you face jail time.  </p>
<p>When there are rules and laws in place, to forbid some thoughts, even if those thoughts are stupid ... that means something is hidden, or a lie is going on ... There is also a general rule, that says that history has been written by the winners ...</p>

        <p>before the war Hitler was making threats about holding people hostage in camps and if the USA declared war/invaded, then he would do bad things to them</p>
<p>then the US declared war/invaded, Germany was suffering food shortages as well as many other shortages, and the Germans picked who was going to get the food and supplies and who was disposable</p>

        <p>the reason I respond to you with "lol" and similar is because you use these little factoids you think have a lot more explanatory value than they do, e.g., this one:</p>
<p>&rt;Churchill ... wasn't pm when war broke out.</p>
<p>So what? Whether Churchill was PM or not has little to do with whether Churchill was a primary cause in setting the stage for Britain idiotically agreeing to a territorial integrity guarantee with fuckin Poland which led the Polish  asininely refusing to negotiate a rail corridor to Danzig.</p>

        <p>This is not similar to Orwell or Bradbury, or even the giver. Yes you are asked to wear a mask or you won't be let into a building; but why doesn't this group rally around not wearing shirts and shoes and try to enter a store? 
It's Bradbury, becuase you can look up all the ingredients in the vaccines online. But it might be that the words are big and that's hard to understand but it's not censorship. 
Nor is it totalitarian like in 1984, why? Safety regulation are put in place all the time to protect people. The same arguments against masks were made when people were forced to wear <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cbccalgary/videos/10154303584053000/">seatbelts</a>. 
"I can't breath" "I will get a doctor's note" 
The scare against vaccine "passports" necessary if you want to travel anywhere. You would.probably get mad if you found out your country let people in who weren't vaccinated, but other countries feel the same. You will need the paper work to prove you got the shot if you want to travel again. No different then a travel visa, no travel visa =/= entery.</p>

        <p>Let's role play for just a minute.</p>
<p>It's 2026, you've been getting vaccine boosters every 6 months.</p>
<p>It's no big deal because you and your spouse have insurance to foot the bill. You're fine because your vaccine passport is up to date so you don't notice any difference in your day to day life. You feel a slight superiority over those who "chose" not to get the Vax and keep their vaccine passports up to date. </p>
<p>Suddenly... the person who has primary insurance in your family loses their job. It was automated. COBRA runs out and you skip your 6 month "booster" shot to help pay for the mortgage, food, car insurance. </p>
<p>No big deal right? Your vaccine passport expires but you won't be doing any traveling or anything that requires one, whats a few more months of hardship?</p>
<p>Until you go for your first job interview. You can't get into the city center through the checkpoint. Even if you could, the building wouldn't let you in.</p>
<p>You can't get a vaccine passport because you missed your booster. So you have to get the vaccine again but you can't afford it because it costs more than your mortgage since you don't have insurance. </p>
<p>It's a downward spiral. </p>
<p>Only the docile, medicated, compliant get the jobs, keep the jobs. It's not about merit. It's about being a good consumer</p>

        <p>Counter role play I'm told I need a booster. I go and get my booster through my public health care system. Fees are cheaper since governments negotiate prices. And is the reason insulin only costs about 30$ here and 300$ in the US. For me and the other 120 ish countires with health care this is literally a problem we will never have to encounter.</p>

        <p>Me nothing, walked in got the shot, month later got the 2nd. Last time I was in for a check up the doc also mentioned a vaccine that helped against some forms of testicular cancer and asked if I wanted it, I got it and it cost me nothing. Had an mri on my foot once a few years ago and stayed over night in the hospital. Most expensive part of that was the fiver I spent at the vending machine.
It's only profit driven if your system is profit driven. And engaging in practices that stretch out how long the disease is here only means more money going to big pharma. 
So either you are against big pharma or your against having small aspects of your life temporarily inconvenienced.</p>

Limit travel, wearing masks, quarantines. 
This has all been done time and time again becuase it helps. But why are you actively against these measures that will help stop this. So by going against it you are perpetuating it and you are helping them get more profits by ensuring more people will let sick in the long run</p>

        <p>The emasculation of men is a crucial part of the plan. Venerate the weak, cowardly, and pathetic. Call masculinity "toxic" and convince young males that weakness is a virtue. </p>
<p>This ensures a passive, submissive populace that you can control. Just look at China. Their men are effeminate, shy, weak, pathetic.</p>
<p>And look how much control their government has over them.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that so many people are falling in line. We took two whole generations of males and turned them into little girls, and kept them that way. You think because that soyboy grew a beard that his balls have dropped too? Nope!</p>

        <p>If only this analogy would hold up.</p>
<p>In ww1 and 2 they were threatened by bullets so they got helmets, camo Gear and training to stop them from getting hot from said bullets. Man they even invented tanks. In that period 3% of ppl died during the war.</p>
<p>Now we're fighting a virus. A helmet and camo Gear would be pretty fucking useless against it no?</p>
<p>We wear a mask cause it helps us not get infected. It increases chances of survival. Just like a helmet and camo Gear did back then</p>
<p>Not wearing a mask is like going to war wearing a flashy hawaiian shirt with sandals and a sign saying "shoot me"</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask isn’t my issue, demanding people lockdown and get an experimental jab is my issue. Wear a mask all you want, that’s fine with me. But the damage done by governmental overreach with lockdowns isn’t fully known yet, but it’s already significant. The jabs are proving to be less effective as advertised and more dangerous than advertised. France has implemented a vaccine passport system with other countries to follow suit, I’m sure. The president of the US has said unvaccinated people are “killing people”. People are wishing death upon unvaccinated people. All of this over a virus with a 99.97% survival rate if you’re under the age of 65. </p>
<p>You wear your mask to “protect others”. Your surgical or cloth mask doesn’t protect yourself from anything.</p>

        <p>99.97% is a number idk where you get that one if we look at a western country it's 99,8%. In other countries it's even lower. (99.4% in the worst countries)</p>
<p>There are 4 million ppl death from it and many will have consequences for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>If you think it's ok to just throw 4 million lives away cause you don't want a little paper that has your name on it and wether you're veccinated or not. (cause that's what the vaccination passport is I can show you a pic of mine if you want contact me in pm)</p>

        <p>See I both agree and disagree with you. I'm generally for some form of personal responsibility. I just don't think many people can handle it, it's been proven over and over again. And if someones parents or grandparents lives are dependent on the personal responsibility of others, should they trust them or the government? That's really the question here.

        <p>In my experience, working in the medical field for over a decade, people who are truly medically fragile and vulnerable typically do a very good job of self isolating. They don’t need the government to step in and issue broad mandates that adversely impact healthy, working people to keep them safe. </p>
<p>It is a tough situation, but in general it’s a better idea to let the population work things out for themselves than for a government entity to step in and set the rules, which also set precedents for future government decisions. </p>
<p>Touchy subject for sure, though.</p>

        <p>Lol no one's ever afraid until they get punched in the face. It's why people also glorify war. It's all games until you get shot. It's all games until you get seriously infected. You can make up any percentage, manipulate any data to fit any narrative. It's actually beyond simple. And everyone takes advantage of it for their purposes. I can fully admit that part.</p>

        <p>The problem is that non-politcal sentiments can lead to political leanings. </p>
<p>For example, this post is a condemnation of the men in our society for "not living up to their ancestors", an explicitly fascist sentiment. </p>
<p>Have you ever heard by chance "strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times, hard times create strong men"?</p>
<p>This literally hits 6 of Umberto Eco's 14, return to tradition, action for action's sake, life is permanent struggle, scorn for the weak, the cult of death, and machismo. </p>
<p>6 characteristics of fascism in one post. That has to be a record.</p>

        <p>Then why don't you wear a condom 24/7? You could potentially infect someone with aids? Have you done a STD test lately? I guess you don't, so maybe you are infected ... You don't want to kill my grandmother with aids by not wearing a condom when you do groceries, right?</p>

        <p>Many who survive Covid go on to have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351">long-term symptoms</a> ranging from organ failure to blood clots to chronic fatigue.

<p>The allies fought in WW2 in service to a good cause, but the war effort still required sacrifice from all of society, not just soldiers; covid is a virus, and it's the responsibility of all adults to protect kids who are too young to be vaccinated so they don't have to lose their eyes unnecessarily.</p>

Life is risky. Illnesses suck. Doesn’t mean my health, or anyone else’s, is the responsibility of society as a whole, other than the most basic common courtesy measures like staying home if you’re obviously sick.
But it is 100% not my responsibility to inject myself with an experimental gene therapy to protect someone else.</p>

        <p>Funny I care about people, in fact I respect people so much I allow them to freely think and make choices for themselves and let them decide how to best protect themselves. I'm not a Bafoon or obedient lapdog. Imagine still thinking masks and locking down work and acting like the long term psychological damage done by them doesn't exist. I see the big picture, you read the same narrative over and over. You don't critically think. You're self righteousness is really just misplaced anger.</p>
<p>Like I said you didn't give a duck all about the sick people dying from other illnesses that you or the government didn't care about prior to 2020. You've been so conditioned it's sad honestly.</p>

        <p>So when COVID is over… you’re going to be an advocate for healthy life styles and nutrition right? It’s embarrassing to think more people die from obesity right now than starvation… that says a lot about us and what we are defending, no? </p>
<p>It should be no surprise that the covid death toll is what it is because of our obesity epidemic… or alternatively because of mal-nutrition and environmental factors in developing countries right?</p>
<p>It’s crazy that we live in a corporatocracy, where our very foundations in western culture normalize and promote cheap, tasty, garbage, high processed foods, with tons of fats and sugar. That’s our system and that’s what is stacked against our working class demographics… like, it’s not entirely the individuals fault for being obese and unhealthy but a system built around it, that makes it so… we should be more critical of this reality IMO. </p>
<p>And just to think this cycle perpetuates itself until we reach our 50s and 60s… so, now western medicine comes along and does wonderful things for us… we can get medications, surgeries and therapy’s… it leads us right back to our old habits… we might get to that bench mark age in the 80s but not without a dependency on medications etc, that lowers our standard of living and doesn’t address any fundamental change in our behaviours… because ya know, profits, and how the system works. </p>
<p>Remember when the Obamas even tried to remodel the school nutrition system only to be stymied by corporate lobbyists… and that’s what is preconditioned at our youth. Yet we never think about this or atleast as much as we should… </p>
<p>So shouldn’t an equal campaign aimed at conditioning the masses to eat healthy while also pushing the vaccine for at risk individuals be perused by our institutions at the same time? seems logical right? Would have been logical if that was the case for decades prior too amiright? It would get hesitant folks more willing to trust government… because had they <em>cared</em> before thatd mean they care for us now right? 18 million dying each year world wide due to heart disease alone right… and for decades! </p>
<p>But, instead of being critical of our own reality we think we’re the good magnanimous altruists in the world. Everything we have, such as our surplus in food, cheap household products, clothes and electronics are at the misery, expense and exploitation of the entire world around us… we blame eachother… specifically people questioning our current doctrines and narrative… meanwhile our institutions and system who have had the resources and profits to institute fundamental change in our healthcare system, life styles and education have choose not to for decades for profits… and here you are demeaning strangers on the internet… instead of seeing the culprit which is our very own institutions. They get off scot free. While pretending to be the saviours.</p>
<p>Do you ever think of the law of declining virulence? Of do you piously believe that our most enlightened geneticists and scientists have covered every single variable and nuance with this new vaccine technology? That they have foreseen every conceivable outcome even without long term data on human subjects? That humans in general tend of be an over confident and arrogant species? That we think we can play god and actualy control nature and a virus with science alone (I’m an atheist btw)? That we are reactionaries? That the virus is endemic at this point? Do you ever question these things or yourself? Or question those that don’t? Do you ever think the experts raising concern even if they are in a minority are doing so because that’s a foundation of the scientific method? That contrarians and scientists on the fringes shed light on unforeseen details that the established doctrine/narrative have missed? </p>
<p>Do any of these thoughts ever cross your mind? I’m sincerely asking? </p>
<p>I live in Ontario… lockdowns have been extremely strict here… everyone still wears a mask myself included… I’ve worked through the entire pandemic in private aviation and was deemed essential for medical contracts involving patient, organ, and Medical personnel tranfers… wife lost half her business due to covid… it’s been a struggle… yet you could still book a massage… what has your personal experience been like? Not trying to be snarky here just trying to get some perspective… </p>
<p>Do you think just because we live in a western democracy that we’re not subject to brainwashing ideals? That we’re immune to propaganda whether it be CNN, FOX, MSM, or any other media platform… That whether it’s an autocratic or democratic nation that consolidation of power has and always will be primary objective number 1? That’s political science 101. </p>
<p>You don’t believe Machiavellian “caligulas” operate vestiges of technocratic elite, bureaucratic lobbyist and governmental positions, where eugenics and depopulation is never discussed? Especially in a world where climate change and its irreversible effects could be felt in the next 10 to 15 years; while we experience droughts, forest fires, frequent hurricanes, the destruction of the rain forests (no longer a basin for carbon absorption), 50 percent coral reef decimation, bio diversity loss, over fishing, entire fleets of Chinese fishing vessels plundering coastal shores of sovereign nations, while we do the same… dwindling resources… how the other half of the human population without western luxuries want the same… or how about the divide between the rich and the poor, hyper inflation, mass automation, human waste… you think our institutions know <em>less</em> about this stuff… or more? Or could act accordingly with self perceived justification</p>
<p>How do you think of covid… and not think about all of this? So it truly is just shut up and take your vaccine to you? We’ll sort and solve all of this after? </p>
<p>Btw. I’m an idiot, I’ve been led astray, I could very well be wrong about everything, I’m also a hypocrit, suffer from cognitive dissonance, dunning Kruger effect, and question myself daily… I just don’t think it’s that simple… but I’m glad it is for you… I hope you’re right.</p>

<p>Yes, actually. I think the term “pick your battles” applies here. Everyone is obsessed with the vaccine rn, so how are you going to put attention on all of those other issues? Until you do just “shut up and take it” all you are is another distraction from issues that actually fucking matter.</p>

        <p>Well, I guess you’re right… I shouldn’t be bringing up healthy eating habits and or lifestyles… or questioning anything like western culture and how our institutions snd way of life has ultimately exasperated this issue and has made it what it is… I shouldn’t think out side the box… or bring up contrarian views… </p>
<p>I shouldn’t be critical of the collective power of the 1%? </p>
<p>Or how the resources and power at their disposal could’ve effectively ended world hunger, the obesity problem, and other world issues… sure it’s complex… but it would be worth the effort to overcome no? </p>
<p>But hey Bezos is in space now… I guess that’s great for humanity… </p>
<p>So you think the virus is not endemic? </p>
<p>You think the most enlightened geneticists and scientists are “perfection” and could never be flawed. </p>
<p>If you actually don’t mind me asking what has your personal experience been like? Since the lockdown here in Ontario… there’s been a 75 percent increase in overdoses and suicides amongst the 20 - 50 age demographic… in fact more people have died from those things in that age gap than have from covid… not to mention over 250 000 delayed surgeries and undetected cancer screenings over the last approx 2 years… </p>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier where I am we still have strict lockdowns and mask mandates… for which I’m not directly opposed too… I’ve maybe seen 4 maskless people since the start of the pandemic… and I conduct myself with a risk assessment… I don’t party, I’ve avoided social gatherings, I work in an environment that is outdoors… where I can keep social distancing measures… like I’m not handing out pre licked lollipops at an old age home if you want to bring up hypotheticals… I work with people who actively think the virus doesn’t exist… yet we’re all behaving in a way that suggests we’re not putting eachother at unnessary risk… </p>
<p>So really what has life been like for you during this mess?</p>
<p>I’m just thinking out loud here.. and apparently that’s wrong to you…</p>

        <p>Actually I take precautions around people who want precautions taken but it's not the government's job to take from one group and give to another especially when all their measures are ineffective and their solution is to double down on ineffective policies while they convince brainless drones like you who are easily manipulated that it is is a subsect of the population causing further harm when it truly is their incompetence, shady dealings, lies and deceit, and lack of transparency which has led to a lack of unity across the globe. You wrap yourself in a cloak of altruism but really your naive and can't see a bigger picture of the harm and dangers that are occurring outside immunocompromised people dying off. Like I said many people died all across the globe for various conditions before 2020 and you could have cared less. It was a fleeting thought in your.mind if ever. </p>
<p>I love you bringing up who you vote for like this is political debate, shows how controlled you really are to think this stance has anything to do with politics. Let me guess MSNBC told you it's trump voters not getting vaccinated?</p>

        <p>Given that I have family and friends that have died from every single issue you listed before, I’d say my interest in solving all of those goes a bit beyond “fleeting” you disingenuous piece of shit. I brought up one thing I look for in a candidate as an example of that. Work on your reading comprehension.</p>
<p>Perhaps provide an example of the “harm and dangers” that you claim are occurring outside of “immunocompromised people dying off?” Cause that just sounds like fear mongering.</p>

        <p>Suicide rates, depression, domestic violence, children's ability to learn face to face in school especially kids with learning disabilities that cannot perform remote learning, businesses closed and people losing their livelihood.

<p>No it's not disingenuous you fucking wanna be martyr. We all have had people die of disease and illness it's part of life. That doesn't make someone callous to recognize that fact. Again I fail to realize what you looking for in a candidate has anything to do with anything other than a sad attempt for you to continue to try to make yourself look like you're some great person. </p>
<p>I don't want old sick people to die. That has nothing to do with me harming my own body or not being able to make my own decisions about my health in a climate of lies, bullshit, and covering up of data. You're the type of person who buries their head in the sand and always believes you're right. I've constantly evaluated my stance on coronavirus over the course of the last 14 months. From quarantining the first three months and sanitizing my groceries, to wearing a mask at all times, to only wearing a mask in doors, to never wearing a mask,  to considering the vaccine, to not wanting it. I continually evaluate things through multiple lenses. Thats my fucking right and just because you think you're right and you can be a good lapdog for 15 months just means you're an obedient puppet.</p>

Trading a known low risk for an unknown risk didn't make sense for me, but I understand why some would see it differently.</p>

        <p>Because enforcing something that isn't proven is ridiculous and stupid. If you want to wear a mask fine but where is the logic in everyone wearing them. I've worked in hospitals for 6 years. Never did we wear masks in people's rooms because they might be sick prior to COVID. We wore them if they were sick and we're classified for droplet precautions. COVID 19 is airborne so a cloth mask doesn't do shit. People say wear them for asymptomatic spread, this is the most absurd notion especially when the studies of asymptomatic spread aren't fully conclusive. If you are sick it's a good idea to wear a mask to prevent large droplet particles. </p>
<p>Enforcing a vaccine that's novel and no long term studies exist. What could go wrong?</p>

<p>The vaccine isn't necessarily about protecting yourself, it's about protecting more vulnerable people. Just because your particular age cohort is less susceptible to complications from Covid-19, doesn't mean you shouldn't get the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt; Trading a known low risk for an unknown risk didn't make sense for me</p>
<p>Arguably, it's the opposite. We have no idea what the long term effects of Covid-19 are. Vaccines, on the other hand, rarely present adverse affects past the 6 month mark (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html">Source</a>).</p>

        <p>This would be an easy fix, big pharma and the media stop censoring data statistics of the harm of the vaccines and also equally report it's short comings so there was better informed consent. I'm going to have to see this transparency and honest reporting.</p>
<p>A lot more evidence than 4 months of vaccinations as proof that it stops the spread of COVID 19 and that there aren't other tools with plenty of efficacy that could be promoted and used to help reach heard immunity. Herd immunity does not solely rely on a vaccination. Vaccination should be a carefully utilized tool to target specific sections of the populist like a scalpel rather than a shotgun blast like it's being utilized now. Also I will have to have media acknowledge that viral escape from an ill-timed use of a novel vaccination is just as likely a cause of mutated variants as unvaccinated people which there is plenty of anecdotal evidence of and also a theory that is taught in microbiology 101.</p>

        <p>This data is being gathered and being actually assessed by some experts in the field who have expressed concern with the growing body of evidence that the vaccines have way too high of a signal in the VAERS with regards to adverse events. This should be something every person in the world understands and it's simply not being reported. Let's use our brain here, if a healthy 28 year old drops dead one day after getting the vaccine, it's the vaccine. Do you think the average person watching CNN knows there have been over 159 cases of this with regards to the vaccine? Do you think the average person knows there have been more deaths right after the COVID vaccine then every single vaccine combined in the last 50 years? Whether or not we can conclude all of these deaths are due to the vaccine it still should be generating more discussion and experts in the field who have discussed this concern should never be pulled off YouTube. </p>
<p>Delta variant has been around since October yet MSM  is staying the variant popped up due to people not being vaccinated, thanks for making my point. Lies, dishonesty.</p>
<p>There is no absent data on ivermectin, it's being pushed aside. There is plenty enough evidence for it's benefits without almost zero evidence of it causing harm. It has been successfully utilized in various countries. Do you think the average American has any idea about it? If they do they been told one side of the story about it.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can't clump playgrounds under the generic category of "outside transmission." Children play very close. A bunch of kids sneezing on each other while riding down a slide that is covered in mucus will definitely transmit disease. Children are also not as careful about wearing masks.</p>
<p>The CDC maintains that surface transmission during the first three days is only a secondary, rather than primary, form of transmission when the surfaces in question are cleaned and/or disinfected. Daily use of playgrounds that are not being regularly cleaned would have contributed to the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Therefore what? It's ok to be negligent when lives are on the line as long as the people in question might die from something else anyway?</p>
<p>Closing playgrounds is not immediately about surface transmission (which is still a minor problem if the playground isn't cleaned). Children play right next to each other, they tend to have lower hygiene standards than adults, and they aren't careful about masks. There is a lot of direct contact in playgrounds.</p>

        <p>Forcing people to close their businesses and not allowing people to go to church or visit their dying mother in the nursing home due to yet another contagious respiratory virus (which we have always had, and will always have) goes well beyond "It's ok to be negligent".  I'm sorry you can't see that.  Life is full of things that are <strong>not</strong> Covid-19 but you and many others don't seem to be aware of that.  It's really really weird.  And children have been playing next to each other for millennia, but somehow, suddenly, that is something you and others like you think we need to be concerned about to the point of suddenly, somehow, thinking that they should wear a mask over their airway.</p>

        <p>Covid-19 is a novel phenomenon. It has to be addressed in a unique way. The other respiratory viruses we have experienced simply don't have the combination of infectiousness and morbidity to cause the damage that Covid-19 has caused.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that statistics about the morbidity of other viruses can be misleading, when not properly studied. That other viruses have a higher morbidity rate is precisely why they are less dangerous in some cases. Viruses that kill more of their victims can't spread as effectively. Covid-19 has a unique combination of characteristics, <em>including a low morbidity rate,</em> which have allowed it to become a global pandemic.</p>

        <p>&rt;  the damage that Covid-19 has caused</p>
<p>The reaction to Covid-19 has caused far more damage than the virus itself.  More than 99.9% of us didn't die from it; those who did were the very most vulnerable among us.  Far more people have suffered due to the reactions than the virus itself.  People are viewing each other as disease vectors and plague spreaders now; the fearmongering had been so rampant that people are still afraid to touch things other people have touched.  People have been frightened so badly that they think it's a good idea to cover their child's airway with cloth.</p>
<p>It's not misleading to say that more than 99.9% of us didn't die;  it's a very important fact that gets little attention.</p>

        <p>I'm not denying the survivability rate, I'm simply pointing out that:</p>
<ol>
<li>That survivability rate is the major reason why Covid-19 is so contagious. Even with a high survivability rate, millions of people have died because of how contagious it is. A small morbidity rate will still kill a lot of people if it affects a large enough amount of people.</li>
<li>That the deaths tend to be among the vulnerable members of society doesn't make it ok. They are entitled to protection, just like everyone else. Their lives aren't less valuable just because they are more likely to die from other things as well.</li>

        <p>&rt; millions of people have died because of how contagious it is</p>
<p>Four.  Four million people, in well over a year.  Meanwhile, two and a half million people die from <a href="https://thevaccinereaction.org/2019/11/medical-errors-kill-five-people-per-minute-2-6-million-people-every-year/">medical error</a> year after year after year, and you don't hear a peep about that.  And those people aren't the ones with a foot already out the door anyway with an average age of over 80, and most with other ailments like obesity and diabetes and cancer.</p>
<p>&rt;They are entitled to protection, just like everyone else</p>
<p>Fine, but not at the expense of all of the rest of us.  Forcing children to wear a mask, indefinitely, in order to protect 80 year old granny who weighs 300 pounds and has leukemia is beyond reasonable, and I bet you most of those grannies would agree.</p>

        <p>Medical error isn't a pandemic; it's the inevitable result of the fact that doctors are human. If there was a way to prevent flare ups of medical error by vaccinating, we would do it, but there is no vaccine that can change the reality of human nature.</p>
<p>And, it's honestly frightening that people are being so flippant with human lives, simply because their beloved grandparents are "a foot already out the door anyway."  No one is being forced to wear masks indefinitely. I'm fully vaccinated, and I don't wear a mask anymore because of it.</p>

Why aren't we being bombarded with propaganda telling us to always 'get a second opinion' and 'we need to do something about medical errors killing people'?

        <p>The problem is you don't understand shit. I work in healthcare and I have a doctorate. I don't need to have a doctorate to be able to critically think and evaluate the research but it helps and it allows me not to believe in so called experts who aren't critically thinking for themselves. I was taught that in 7 years of school. 4 with a bachelor's in biology and 3 with graduate studies in clinical practice. Education alone does not make someone a critical thinker. My fucking primary care physician doesn't truly know shit about COVID or the vaccine and that was apparent after about him spending 5 minutes giving me CNN and Dr. Fauci talking points. </p>
<p>A pandemic doesn't only rely on the study of microbiologist btw you ass hat. It should be a collaboration between many fields, virology, vaccine researchers, evolutionary biologist, immunologist, economist, MDs in critical care fields actually treating patients and their clinical experience. There should be an open discussion and collaboration from various perspectives. That is not how it has worked for this pandemic in any sense of the word. The WHO which is a questionable organization sets guidelines, institutions then follow them to the best of their ability, that gets passed down through the medical hierarchy. Within that hierarchical structure there will be some who are better qualified or begin to understand things outside the applied guidelines. These people instead of being heard are being silenced. They are attacked and idiots like you try to cancel them with biased fact checking articles by spineless journalist who are paid to make straw man arguments that could never defend their shit articles in actual debate with some of these scientist going against the grain. This finally passes on to people like you too dumb to critically think and that gobble every fucking thing you hear on TV and the radio until one day you either wake the fuck up.</p>
