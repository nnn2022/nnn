    <strong>Journal Nature: USE IVERMECTIN FOR COVID YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!</strong>
    <p><p>This changes everything, IMHO. Let's see if any brave journalists take up the topic now that it's in such a serious publication. </p>

        <p>They discredited it because if there was a viable treatment they couldn’t have issued an emergency authorization for the vaccine. Sickening. They have essentially murdered hundreds of thousands. Nuremberg trials and nooses if it can be proven they knew and surpressed it.</p>

        <p>Also if that or hydroxychloroquine is not available, even though it is not so effective, i had luck recovering with drinking green tea while its hot everyday to keep hydrated, adding real ginger, squeezed lemon and natural/organic honey there and resting on bed, if you sweat, its a good sign, also warm/hot steamy showers once in 1-3 days (depending how you feel) are essential to get all phlegm out of throat/lungs.</p>
<p>Just a tip for those who have nothing else and/or prefer natural remedies.</p>

        <p>I took Ivermectin, 2 doses so far after having long haul covid-like symptoms after taking the vaccine, and seems like it's helping so far. </p>
<p>So it might help for people who have bad vaccine side effects too.</p>

        <p>Yikes, did you even read the article?</p>
<p>Despite being being hosted on nature.com, it clearly <em>wasn’t</em> published in Nature. Pretty much the first thing you see on the link is “Journal of Antibiotics”…</p>
<p>And did you actually read the article? All it is is a review of the many possible ways Ivermectin could affect the virus that causes COVID-19. Zero about any actual clinical efficacy or advocating for it’s use.</p>

        <p>Sorry for the late response, I've been on a 3 day timeout for calling someone like you the R word.</p>
<p>The Journal Antibiotics is a sub-journal of Nature. This peer reviewed journal article not only breaks down the biological mechanism via which Ivermectin fights COVID but they also summarize the 55 studies which have been done confirming it works. Finally, they conclude that Ivermectin is worthy of further attention in the fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Seems like it's you who didn't read the article because you had those thick doomer glasses on.</p>

        <p>&rt; The Journal Antibiotics is a sub-journal of Nature.</p>
<p>Well, no. It’s a journal by the Japan Antibiotics Research Association that happens to be one of ~150 journals  published by the Nature Publishing Group, a large publishing group that also publishes the flagship Nature journal (based in England) and uses ‘Nature’ for branding. </p>
<p>Being published by the same organization doesn’t lend one the prestige of another. That’s like looking at a Volkswagen Jetta thinking “ooooh that’s made by the same manufacturing corporation that makes the Bugatti Chiron”. Obviously silly. </p>
<p>&rt; but they also summarize the 55 studies which have been done confirming it works</p>
<p>You realize that’s just background they included in their introduction as their justification for diving into the all the mechanism stuff right? That wasn’t their work or the point of the publication at all. They were just parroting the ivmmeta.com stuff (reference 8 is just that website), which appears to be a non-peer-reviewed meta-analysis and not published in a scientific journal. The only published peer-reviewed study that was cited in the article you linked that actually addressed clinical efficacy of Ivermectin for COVID was reference 9, which didn’t find an effect. </p>
<p>So at best, you’re laundering unpublished non-peer-reviewed science by pointing to this article. And not to say that Ivermectin definitely doesn’t work, or the meta-analysis from ivmmeta.com is junk, it’s certainly possible that their analysis is good and it does work. But what you’re pointing to isn’t the published peer-reviewed science that we need to say with enough certainty that it does work and justifies treating people outside of clinical trials with it. </p>
<p>So yes, I actually did read the article. And I have the understanding of the broader context to know why it’s not what you purport it to be.</p>
