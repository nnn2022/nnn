        <p>To the capitalist, every luxury of the worker is reprehensible :) however, it is important we maintain responsible and ethical consumption in the current climate. However, I find with people wanting to end lockdown, they stand on the livelihoods of small business owners to make their argument but will not support them when the lockdowns are lifted. This subreddit is interesting, and I am open to the opinions. Still I am for a lockdown to an extent, but definitely I can appreciate the anti authoritarian stance and freedom of thought this subreddit enables :)</p>

        <p>It’s the same people who scream freedom of speech when they really just want freedom from consequence. On one hand, I want to say; the lockdown does effect mental health, but it’s important to remember mental health and mental illness are two different things. Lockdown is of course going to effect the mental health of people, the difference is though it is rational, people are out of routine, away from loved ones, and in a lot of cases struggling financially. People are struggling. However I think framing it as a “mental health issue” makes it an individualist issue rather then just the general problem that it is. 
On the other hand though, issues that effect mental health aren’t solved by going shopping, or getting dinner or going to a café. And there is no point in raising these issues if the people struggling have no where to turn in the end. Do you actually want to help local business or will you just go back to getting Starbucks every day once places can open up again? Do you care about mental health or those suffering with mental illness or are you using it as a pawn because your idea of freedom is going shopping? and the other problems that are exasperated by lockdown (domestic abuse, child abuse, etc) aren’t going to get better when the lockdown is lifted. It shouldn’t be the responsibility of the child or the man or woman being abused to have to find ways to stay out of their home as long as possible. Again, what is the purpose of bringing up these issues if your solution is just to open up existing shops and facilities?
 I’m happy a subreddit like this exists, for people to voice their finalised opinions, however I’m not one of those people, I think the issues surrounding this lockdown aren’t something that can be boiled down to just “stay inside so people won’t die” and “but my freedom” and I feel like self proclaimed free thinkers referring to those abiding by the guide lines as sheep is no better then us grouping you as the stereotypical white middle class American Facebook mom. I guess what I believe is, the lockdown has created many problems, but I’d hope that through community many of those problems could be prevented or cured. Set days to support local business, to buy even just one birthday or Christmas gift from a small business, to get coffee or lunch with a friend at a family owned restaurant instead of a chain, to look out for and check up on members of your community where possible. Unfortunately in the current climate, supporting small business and buying sustainably or ethically sourced goods is a luxury instead of a standard, but to have many people making a small, consistent purchases to a small business is better then a few people making huge, rare purchases. 
That is just the way I see things anyways, but it’s important always to be open, even to opinions of ignorance or hate. When we speak, we only repeat what we already know, but when we listen we learn :)</p>

        <p>Great great great post! Agreed with everything you wrote. It’s clear as day the west is going through some kind of change. </p>
<p>A big reason for why we are in this predicament is that nobody knows what to believe anymore. Finding accurate information that’s as biased as possible shouldn’t be as hard as it is now. </p>
<p>As all good things humans get a hold of..... a select extreme few ruin it for the rest of us. Leave it to us to create something as powerful as the internet and abuse it for personal gain</p>

        <p>I’m not American and I don’t live in the US, but definately even your two main news sources are so divided in extremes, and having people turn your head every which way to the terrible things to happen in either situation is definitely going to cause a lot of upset and distrust. I don’t know if you have anything similar, but in Ireland where I live we have the HSE, the the UK has the NHS, which aside from providing a health care system are kind of a governing body that only spreads objective information about covid 19, transmissions, symptoms etc. It seems very bleak and hopeless, so also just know that it’s ok to disconnect for a while, If anything big happens you’ll know about it ahahahaha</p>
