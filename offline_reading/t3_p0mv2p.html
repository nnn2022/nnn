    <strong>There is a simple way to flatten the curve of government overreach and violation of our inalienable rights...</strong>
    <p><p>If every unvaccinated person decided to vote with their dollar and simply refuse to pay taxes until those in power are removed and punished for treason, it would only take 'two weeks to flatten the curve' of government overreach and violation of rights.</p>
<p>The war machine we funded that has turned against us would be brought to its knees without us having to harm any of our own. We can apply the fundamentals of capitalism to our government since they NEED US not the other way around. People who pay their taxes, stimulate their local economy, provide jobs, take care of their communities and look out for their neighbors don't rely on government and the bureaucratic process it has in place to prevent actually helping those that support it. </p>
<p>Instead of taking to the streets let's take to our communities and play by their rules and start taking care of those around us that the government has tricked into being fully dependent on the government and kept in a cycle of generational poverty. </p>
<p>Two weeks with only 50% of the required tax dollars coming in to meet the budget would cause anyone who wants to avoid the collapse of society to open their eyes and think twice about poking the bear that is the spirit of the American people</p></p>

        <p>Will never happen, I live in a so called rough place and I see them all in masks. People are scared of the unknown and lies the media tells them. The rough place part isn’t true to me as I’ve lived in a lot worse places. So my truth isn’t everyone truth.</p>
