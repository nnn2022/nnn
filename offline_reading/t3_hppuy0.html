    <strong>If stores can require customers to wear masks to enter, where does it end?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm actually seriously curious about this and I can't seem to find any answers. I know the typical "No shirt, No shoes, No service" thing is something most if not all stores do, and now they're adding masks to that. Legally though, where is the line for what a business can and can not require of a customer?</p>
<p>For example, could I open a grocery store and require all customers to wear gloves and hair nets (that I do not provide btw)? Can I require people to be wearing glasses and ask anyone not wearing glasses to leave? Can I require women to show no skin and wear burkas? Can I require people take *off* their clothes to be allowed to enter my business?</p>
<p>I know a lot of people will argue that this is only because of mandates from governors and health departments, but imagine this: The health department of your state puts out a mandate that in order to enter a business you must first insert a 12" steel rod rectally and it must remain in place until you leave. If the entire local government and media collude on this and publish cooked studies showing the effectiveness of steel rods at eliminating viruses when inserted anally, would this still be enforceable? </p>
<p>I've tried finding the actual laws about this on google but all I can find are articles about how stupid people are for not wearing masks and it's driving me insane.</p></p>

<p>There is no legal limit outside of discrimination laws. </p>
<p>Legally a place could serve "No shirt, no shoes" but due to social norms it isn't profitable for places like grocery stores and the like. </p>
<p>Businesses can just make whatever restrictions (or lack thereof) that they want unless it falls under discrimination laws. Masks do not fall under discrimination laws. They can even require people to wear a burka if they so wish.</p>
<p>The reason most businesses who require masks outside of mask states are doing the mask thing is virtue signaling.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  Private businesses can do whatever they want aside from the protected discrimination groups (race, etc).  It's the way it should be in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you don't like their rules, shop somewhere else.  Unfortunately the corner store I have been going to mask free finally started doing masks because not fear of fines.</p>
<p>If you care that much, you gotta grow or kill your own food I guess now.</p>

        <p>In NC it's mandatory masks unless you have a health condition.</p>
<p>So if a store denies you entry because you're not wearing a mask because you have a health condition, they may be liable under the Americans with Disabilities Act for discrimination. The Act requires them to make a reasonable accommodation.</p>

        <p>Remember that a reasonable accommodation doesnâ€™t mean entry.  Curbside pickup for goods is a reasonable accommodation.</p>

<p>As a former Floridian, even this wasn't super enforced. Walmarts would have teenagers walking around in bathing suits at times during the summer. Maybe it's just me, but I'm a weirdo that believes that as long as people are wearing clothes that cover genitalia (modesty rules, and all that), then they should be free to go anywhere they want without being hounded by security.</p>

        <p>Personally, it doesn't really bother me that privately-owned business make decisions (even those that may be ill-advised) for what they perceive to be public health and safety.  For instance, if you hold a concealed carry permit, you can't carry in businesses that post that firearms aren't allowed, and I'm OK with that.   I don't agree with it, but it is ultimately their choice.  To me, wearing masks is less a benefit of viral protection, and more a matter of hopefully preventing idiots like the folks who were licking ice cream containers from having access to that for the time being.  </p>
<p>To more directly answer your question--it ends within what is considered 'reasonable' for either 'health' or 'safety' (like the firearms thing).   While 'reasonable' is vague, it's because the law is interperative, and it is this way in most cases.   In the examples of people wearing glasses, you have a discrimination suit, because there is a reasonable accomodation (i.e. wearing glasses) to ensure the person can remain safe (they can see).</p>

        <p>There isnâ€™t a limit. Thatâ€™s how nightclubs can require certain styles of dress (no sneakers etc) and be exclusive about only letting in attractive people or whatever their standards are. That business model doesnâ€™t work outside of the nightclub industry so we just donâ€™t see it exercised much.</p>

        <p>It works both ways - a company that doesn't enforce this could also get business from people boycotting mask businesses.</p>
