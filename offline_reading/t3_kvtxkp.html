        <p>Just to potentially add a little context that may be relevant...</p>
<p>Immigration to Britain during this time period has been extremely high, well over 100,000+ people per year coming into the country such that there is a belief that the bulk of our population growth is attributed to immigration, not births.</p>
<p>Almost all the immigrants are working age-folk (and their children), and as such you would expect them to die a bit less than a settled population, since age would be spread differently amongst the population. But of course as immigrants age just like everyone else, the death rates will go back up over time.</p>
<p>The point is that a death rate &rt;1% is completely normal and to be expected, and the fact that the UK has been below it for the last decade or so is largely explained by population factors, not some magic of healthcare.</p>

        <p>O.11 of that 1.03% are people who died within 28 days of a positive PCR test. They might as well have had a piece of sars-cov-2 RNA in their nose on the day of the test, and died of anything within 28 days. </p>

        <p>Looking at this data in more than this one way yields some interesting results. Of the deaths in the UK in 2020, about 14% were due to COVID.</p>
<p>Is that not alarming? If essentially one in seven deaths in a country were homicides, we'd all rightfully want something done about the homicide problem. Same with suicide, or any other non-chronic cause of death.</p>
<p>The lockdowns also mean less people are out and about, which lowers a lot of other causes of death like accidents or other less contagious diseases. This is all to say that the 1.03% figure isn't particularly surprising even if a bunch of people died of COVID.</p>
<p>In summation, this data doesn't entirely support COVID being a non-issue; in fact, the 14% figure sort of supports the opposite conclusion.</p>

        <p>No lockdowns have killed people.  People are not safe in their homes no matter how much you want to deny it.  People are committing suicide, dying from alcohol abuse, dying in nursing homes due to loneliness, dying from untreated medical conditions due to not being able to go to the hospital or simply being too afraid to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>Do you really think everyone is at home on holiday?  Really?  Is that what the news is telling you?  Why do you believe that?  Seriously- why do you believe that?</p>

        <p>I'm not claiming any of that, don't straw man me here. Suicide rates are up, so are a lot of the other rates you mention. And that's, in no uncertain terms, a problem that needs addressing.</p>
<p>But even if those rates are tripled because of lockdowns (which is far higher than any source claims), based on 2019 numbers we're still not at the total number of deaths from accidents, which are down while people don't go nearly as many places. Never mind the numbers for other communicable diseases which, because of lockdowns and increased sanitation, are down in 2020.</p>
<p>The net sum of these effects are, in a COVID-less world, a year with potentially the lowest mortality rate on record. COVID makes up for a lot of that gap, so naturally we'd see a year with a death rate comparable to other years.</p>

<p>Once you do, it's nowhere near one in seven, it's nearer one in 50</p>

        <p>I mention this in another reply, but I want to formalize it a little bit.</p>
<p>Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there isn't a correlation between a positive test within 28 days and an increased death rate. This means that those who test within 28 days should have the same mortality rate as those who don't. That number is, by the above statistics, 0.89%.</p>
<p>606k people in the UK died with no positive test in the last 28 days.</p>
<p>73k people in the UK died with a positive test in the last 28 days.</p>
<p>3.1 million unique people have tested positive in the UK. Multiple tests by a single person are NOT counted in this statistic.</p>
<p>That means that 2.5% of people who tested positive die, which is far more than the expected number of 0.89% our assumption implies.</p>
<p>Therefore, I reject the assumption and posit a correlation between a positive test within 28 days and an increased death rate.</p>
<p>QED.</p>
<p>This isn't saying that you're entirely wrong: there certainly exist some cases where someone gets, say, ran over by a steamroller within 28 days of testing positive, and that does skew the data. But the above statistics (and one pulled from the UK's testing site) conclusively draws a correlation between testing positive and death. Therefore, we can pretty safely say that most of these people died because of COVID-19. So maybe the ratio isn't one in seven, but we can't say that none of those deaths count when, conclusively, more than half of them wouldn't be dead without COVID.</p>

        <p>Maybe you'd be right, if we didn't also have the data telling us average age of covid death is 82 with 2.5 comorbidities, or the data right in front of you here showing deaths with covid on death certificate are a fraction of covid deaths within 28 days of PCR. Put these two pieces of data together, and it is pretty clear that covid deaths are vastly overestimated. Now addin that Sweden, with extremely light restrictions and no lockdown, has performed way better than the UK with no lockdown. From this, I can only summise lockdown has been directly responsible for a vast amount of deaths in the UK in 2020.</p>

        <p>I don't think that conclusion holds water. Again, COVID played a role in about 14% of these deaths</p>
<p>We shouldn't be discounting the 28-day statistics. How do you explain that, if you died, there was more than a 10% chance that you tested positive 28 days beforehand? You'd be hard pressed to argue that COVID didn't kill the vast majority of these people. And yes, some of those people recovered then died of some of other cause, but why should we expect that death rate to be any higher than the national death rate without COVID of 0.89%?</p>
<p>The average age of COVID death is indeed high, but I don't see how that's relevant. Old people are vastly more likely to be in poor health, so of course the disease would kill more old people. That doesn't change that, without COVID, most of these people would not be dead (again, of COVID was a non-issue, why wouldn't their mortality rate be the 0.89% number?). COVID killed them.</p>
<p>Sweden is not where you want to look. 489k infections for 10.5 million people is a rate of about 4.6% of their total population, which is far higher than the global average (around 1.17% of the globe has had COVID, 91.4 million of 7.8 billion).</p>
<p>And even if they were the paragon of COVID preparedness, they might have places like the UK and USA beat, but why would we automatically assume that there aren't other reasons for that? Sweden has a vastly smaller population density (half the US, about 10% the UK), which means, in the vaguest of senses, less people near each other to spread the virus. That or any other host of reasons could be a cause. </p>
<p>This all isn't to say that I have all the answers or that I'm against your personal freedom to resist the new normal-- you do you, I'll do me, and let's chat about it-- but I think it's worth looking at these numbers from all angles, because these statistics are contrary to the point being made on this subreddit.</p>
<p>I wonder what the mortality rate for "people who locked down" is. I don't know where to find that statistic, but I bet it could be pretty interesting to look at.</p>

        <p>Do you support laws? Every law in the books restricts personal freedom. Taking meth is a personal freedom. Killing people is too. Can I steal your car? I agree that we should work to restrict as few personal freedoms as possible, but there's a trade-off to be made between order and freedom. </p>
<p>We shouldn't just dismiss all these things because they restrict freedom, but rather we should be discussing whether the loss of freedom is worth the order kept.</p>

        <p>Haha quite the reverse, lockdowns are killing people via cancelled treatment, fearful people not seeking immediate treatment for deadly conditions, increased suicides, drug overdoses and alcoholism.  A tiny drop in car accidents isn't going to offset that destruction, as we can see from the data in front of your eyes.</p>
