    <strong>Take time to ACTUALLY be normal</strong>
    <p><p>love this sub and glad it’s full of free thinkers and people who aren’t so easily swayed by their televisions/social media/ social programming. It’s clear there’s an agenda here, it’s clear it’s very sinister, and right now we don’t know how it will end-that’s some scary shit. We’re all in this together-we the people, not the elites and rich hypocrites who tell us we’re all in this together. 
I’ve seen a lot of posts and comments here about how people are at their wits end and even some suicidal ones as well. I too felt that way for a time. I just want to remind everyone to take some time away from your phone, away from the news, and just enjoy the fact that you are alive. You need to understand that a huge part of their plan is demoralization and humiliation. They want you to feel hopeless and they want you to feel ostracized. They want you to be consumed by this and not focusing on yourself on your own happiness. Giving up means they win. Depression and hopelessness is what these people thrive on. It’s how they stay in power and in control. </p>
<p>They have been dividing people forever-black/white rich/poor mask/no mask etc. and they are very good at it. Now they even have a connection to every person on the planet through their phone and the internet. We are all staring at our phones all day and the things we read on them/what we do with them effect our emotional state. (See how easily they’ve been able to brainwash people) Human brains were not meant for such stimulation. Id be willing to wager humanity was much happier before technology.
Pay attention to what is going on-call out the insanity and the tyranny-but do not let it consume you. </p>
<p>Too much of this shit makes you pessimistic, sad, angry, etc. and you won’t be able to attack the evil with a clear mind. Try to limit your screen time and your viewing of depressing masks/lockdowns shit it really takes a toll on your mental health. Put the phone down, meditate, work out, fuck your lady, whatever it is you need to do to clear your mind. Spend more time on that stuff than this. Keep your heads on straight don’t let the evil win-the next few years will be a battle. Enjoy your life as fucked up as the time we’re living in is this is our only life. </p>
<p>Truth and freedom will prevail in the end</p></p>

        <p>By attack the evil I simply mean calling out the unconstitutional mandates and the tyranny by spreading truth and speaking out against it. Refusal to do and submit is good but we must speak against it as well</p>
