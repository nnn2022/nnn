    <strong>Is anyone losing family talking about covid / vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>Mentioned to my mom about Biden’s door to door plan and my sister interjects and says it’s illegal to do hold someone down and inject them with mystery chemicals. I then say the government doesn’t care about laws anymore... anyways it got into a heated debate. </p>
<p>My sister asked me to cite sources IRL when all I was doing was making logical observations. </p>
<p>She was saying covid causes organ failure and how she likes wearing masks to protect people but mostly because of her social anxiety. </p>
<p>My sister couldn’t stop cutting me off and was constantly triggered. Always in defensive mode and rolling her eyes and laughing at what i was saying. I legit felt like I was exercising a demon out of her. It was a less dramatic version of the exorcist. </p>
<p>I laid out how the world works and how it’s fun by families and secret societies and I made lots of Game of Thrones analogies so she could hopefully understand. I told her about how covid is used as a chess move to move wealth and power from the poor to the rich and how China is buying up farms and neighborhoods with fake borrowed money from the banks. Now I’m not 100% correct but if I zoom out on what’s happening that’s more or less the gist. </p>
<p>My sister made concerning comments that if a company can’t service the pandemic they don’t deserve to have a company and they’re shit. Saying that America as a society sucks and we deserve to parish (I’m paraphrasing). </p>
<p>I see a common Trend where people have all the ingredients to a “wake up” sandwich but they can’t seem to put them together. Like these are the problems but you must be a conspiracy theorist to tie them all together. </p>
<p>My mom and dad are on my side and will refuse the vaccine (i think they’d take it under certain pressure but I can only hope they wouldn’t). My parents don’t really care about this they just want to retire. </p>
<p>I love every one in my family and I love my sister very much but I’m simply trying to tell her that she’s taken the bait. Whenever I’d say something she’d get hung up on the smaller facts and try to argue them in attempt to discredit me, missing my entire point. </p>
<p>I made the analogy that she’s eating the work on the hook not realizing there’s a fisherman on the other end.</p></p>

        <p>My family members are awake to the scamdemic. Friends though, that is a different story. I have already lost a few friends, as a result of them taking the poison injections and wearing face diapers. I have zero respect for anyone who partakes in this evil fraud. I tell it like it is, and some people can't handle it. Anyone who believes that this "pandemic" is real is a moron. I can't associate with face diaper cultists.</p>

        <p>I hate even talking about it in conversations. It offends people too quick. If we don’t talk about it it’s gonna wipe us up. The virus isn’t the pandemic here it’s the government</p>

        <p>You can't help anyone who is sleeping. It is not possible. This is the most painful thing about being awake. You will try though, because you love people and want to help them. It is hard to accept that any effort is a futile attempt, and nothing you say or do will open the minds of brainwashed people. It won't matter what approach you use. The ability of the sheep to think in a critical and analytical manner is nonexistent. The brainwashed can't be awakened. It is the sad reality of being programmed by propaganda. They only have the ability to do one thing, which is parrot what the programming has shown them.</p>

        <p>governments will always be evil. the majority will always go along with government evil. you just haven't been alive long enough to see it more than once, but it happens over and over throughout history. it happens every single time. you will not be the one to change this.</p>
<p>the only thing you can do is lay low, survive, form secret dissident groups and sabotage the government whenever you can. but never expose yourself as against the government, suicide is not how you win. secret rebellion, secret groups and sabotage from the inside is how you cause actual damage.</p>
<p>pointless virtue signalling that gets you fired or ostracized instantly without causing actual damage is pointless, you would have caused more damage by infiltrating the enemy and sabotaging it.</p>

        <p>Ngl your sister sounds like a typical mal-educated leftist teenager. You might consider starting by addressing her notion that America deserves it or that America is systematically bad.</p>
<p>Leftist indoctrination is built on that foundation, along with the foundational concept that equity is a desirable outcome. Take out both of those and the whole thing comes crashing down.</p>

        <p>Use the observation=&rt;thought=&rt;emotion-method when talking. This dramatically reduces the chance of people becoming all defensive and argumentative.</p>
<p>The observation-part should only contain things that are free from any interpretation and usually are impossible to falsifyable.</p>
<p>For example if you've read something, don't say: "They will be going from door to door.", say: "I read that they plan on going from door to door."</p>
<p>Now when you interpret it, make sure to add "I think" before your interpretation.</p>
<p>You can mix that with what your emotions about this are. But it's important to just name the emotion rather than acting it out.</p>
<p>By making sure to clearly separate observation and thought, people usually will not argue about it. They might disagree with your interpretation of your observation but they are aware that it's just how you see it and that you are not trying to make them agree with you.</p>
<p>I found that people are much more likely to say "yeah, that makes sense" if you talk like this as compared to talking in a way that makes it seem as if you think you are right and everyone who disagrees with you must be wrong.</p>

        <p>I highly recommend against any behavior that is just meant to put one's ego over that of someone else.</p>
<p>Taking one's ego into a conversation is usually the most common reason as for why people end up having a negative or frustrating experience.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I'm certainly not one to let an ego drive my actions.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree with you at all but the way you describe the conversation sounds like you might have come off as more of a conspiracy theorist to her. I would had used more real world facts to get the point across. One that I can think of is how the premier of Ontario owns a signage/label company and he's gotten much richer over the pandemic supplying label and signs to all the businesses that were mandated to buy them. To me it's not just certain families and societies but everyone in between with an ounce of desire to exploit the pandemic for money and power, this is why I believe many people want this thing to keep going, where it's devastated some business, other sectors have emerged or grown. My wife believes the pandemic is bullshit but if I try to delve into why it's being pushed so hard she loses interest or tunes out.</p>

        <p>I don’t think I need to go that far. My sister thinks these billionaires doubled their wealth on the last year and a half because they’re good businessmen and we as civilians have lost our businesses because we suck at owning businesses. She likes to cite all the main stream spyops/hoaxes; like that guy who supposedly spent 6 months in the hospital for covid. Even if it’s true that’s 1 guy. She was arguing facts which I appreciate but they were all covid narrative facts. </p>
<p>Say a dad and a daughter go to a used car lot and the daughter sees a car she likes. On the surface it looks good but under the hood it’s got problems. Let’s say the dad knows the problems but the daughter has already emotionally purchased the vehicle. The slimy salesman comes up and says how good of a deal it is, how nice it runs etc... since she’s emotionally invested she takes the side of the slimy salesman and argues with the dad who doesn’t think it’s a good car. </p>
<p>That’s exactly what’s happening. People are emotionally purchasing covid while the slimy government keeps selling it to them, then you have us who see through the charade who refuse to accept it.</p>

        <p>I like the car example, I've been there, I was the daughter in that situation at a very early age but quickly became the dad and have thought that way ever since. Women are more emotional by nature I think and your sister sounds like she might be hard to convince that things aren't the way she thinks they are concerning covid. Sounds like your parents are on your side so that is good as I have read some stories on here about parents saying they would kick their kids out if they didn't get the jab. Good luck and stay strong.</p>
