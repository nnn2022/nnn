    <strong>last year Yale did a study on what arguments were best to convince people to get the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04460703?term=Vaccine&amp;cond=Covid19&amp;cntry=US&amp;draw=2">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04460703?term=Vaccine&amp;cond=Covid19&amp;cntry=US&amp;draw=2</a></p>
<p>They studied which groups of people should be targeted with which kind of messages: for example people with older relatives and big families would be more sensitive to "save grandma" messaging, while business owners to "you'll be able to open your business again" messaging. I imagine the "trust in science message" was aimed at people who obey authority figures.</p>
<p>Meaning when Google/Facebook/Reddit (?) shows you specific information, then these are tailored to your profile for maximum effect. This isn't random social media, it's scientifically researched and professionally designed propaganda.</p>
<p>When you agree to take the vaccine because you "thought about it and did the research", it's not because you made up your own mind, it's because you were convinced by covert advertising, posing as random facts. You were told exactly what you needed to hear to comply. It's not free will, it's manipulation of the worst kind.</p></p>

        <p>They call that “framing” in academics. It’s when the media reports something true but delivers it in a certain viewpoint. Like how CNN delivers the news in an egalitarian way, always blaming the “system” such as systemic racism, systemic poverty, systemic equality etc....while news like Fox News delivers it as an individualism viewpoint, “unemployment isn’t due to the economy, it’s due to the individual work ethic” and “You gotta pull yourself up by your boot straps” are a few they frame. Watch any one side long enough and that’s how you get such jaded people biased as hell to either side.</p>

        <p>That study doesn't say that at all. It tested the effectiveness of different messages in equal random groups.</p>

        <p>Didn't read it but looking at what's going on I would say MSM using shaming came out on top.</p>
