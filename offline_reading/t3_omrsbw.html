    <strong>COVID-19 was a money maker/power grab for Big Pharma just like 9/11 was for the defense contractors and military industrial complex</strong>
    <p><p>Just heading over to /r/CovidVaccinated and seeing the number of folks with adverse reactions in perfectly healthy people who had taken the ðŸ’‰, who otherwise never had to go to the doctor but are now having multiple appointments, diagnostic exams, and further medication being prescribed due to strange effects from the jab, I can only imagine how much doctors are raking it in right now. Kinda like how Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and all the other big guns made bank after 9/11.</p></p>

        <p>Wikipedia actually has a fairly reasonable description:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical%E2%80%93industrial_complex">Medical-industrial complex (Wiklpedia)</a></p>
<p><strong>Characteristics</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers of medical devices fund medical education programs and physicians and hospitals directly to adopt the use of their devices.[3]</p>
<p>The management of health care organizations by business staff rather than local medical practice is one of the trends of the increasing influence of the medical-industrial complex.[4]</p>
<p>Another trend is that increased pressure to generate profit for providing services can decrease the influence of creativity or innovation in medical research.[5]</p>
<p>In the 1970s profit-seeking companies became significant stakeholders in the United States healthcare system.[6]</p>
<p>The influence of economic policy on the practice of medicine has a long history.[7]</p>
<p>Because the General Agreement on Trade in Services regulates international marketplaces, in countries where the industrial-medical complex is more strong there can be legal limitations to consumer options for accessing diverse healthcare services.[8]</p>
<p>Because the industrial-medical complex funds continuing medical education, this education has a bias to promote the interests of its funders.[9]</p>

        <p>I don't understand what happened.</p>
<p>A few years ago Big Pharma along with the MIC were pieces of shit in the public's eyes along with Hillary Clinton back in 2015 and Pedophilia , why are all these things politically acceptable now to endorse publically?</p>
