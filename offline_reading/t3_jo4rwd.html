        <p>Is Spiked considered mainstream? If so, I'm glad that this gets mainstream attention. Although I'm not entirely sure it'll mean anything at the end.</p>
<p>I'm in a very pessimistic mood quite often lately. I'm not sure that it is not already too late. Will it help a tiny bit if even majority wakes up right this moment...? Those monsters are pushing their NewNormals and GreatResets and NWOs with incredible force. This is really the greatest threat humanity has ever encountered. (Humanity as I see and understand it. I don't consider masses of biorobots living in a digital control grid fully human.)</p>
<p>Can the tides be turned? I don't know.</p>
<p>What I <em>do</em> know though is that I absolutely without a doubt don't want to take <em>any</em> part in this Brave New Corona World they are creating.</p>

        <p>The tides will be turned.  They cannot contain us all, even if we that do not comply get dealt with there grip on humanity can only last for a certain period of time.    </p>
<p>I have argued with people about this when it comes to China.  But China is fundamentally different, Confucius put the state and a authority as God,  Hegel later did the same in the 18th Century in the West while he is still a prominent thinker.  He hasn’t really changed the democratic foundation of the West
so there foundation is that the State is the one that is fit to rule.  And even in the modern day China propaganda is everywhere to stop resistance from growing.  But America and the West was built upon the foundations of Jean-Jacques-Rosseau, John Locke, Thomas Jefferson.  We were built upon Individuality.   And this foundation won’t be forgotten even if they try to erace it in every written form.  People will still remember it and there individuality can only be surpressed for so long.    And even in the Rockefeller document they predicted 2025 too be the turning point.  This says three things to me 1.There not totally confident in there lock step plan 2.They actually fear our resistance  3.They know that it will fail </p>
<p>So i know that many of my friends will not accept the reality of this lockstep plan and that this might have been planned.   But i can share things like qoutes that inspire there sense of freedom and there questioning of goverment.  If nothing else this reminds them of the values of the past</p>

        <p>&rt;  This says three things to me 1.There (sic) not totally confident in there lock step plan 2.They actually fear our resistance 3.They know that it will fail </p>
<p>i disagree</p>
<p>the cabal is supremely confident, they already won, long ago. this is all part of the current phase.</p>
<p>i disagree with a few other parts of your reply, yet i tire of explaining </p>
<p>in a nutshell, the 'age of enlightenment' was a conspiracy to replace God and the divine rights of kings, with a new god of 'reason' that justified temporal power be stripped from the monarchs and emperors.</p>
<p>all part of the counter reformation and still ongoing, this is part of the end game.</p>
