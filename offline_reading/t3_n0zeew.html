        <p>As we all know by now, they only get off and have pleasure in dictating other to wear a mask and to "social distance." These people truly never had any pleasure in anything prior to covid and after observing them, they are all the same.</p>
<p>Lazy, fat, unambitious and they fucking love sucking the government off anytime they want! And the sad part, they not only do that but they command us to do the same. F them.</p>
<p>These days it's very easy to know who is a clown. While, I have to wear a mask in stores bc I got permanently banned in some for not complying, these doomers are double masking in cars while being alone! This society is truly "progressing" and it's easy to know now who's based and who's not.</p>

        <p>I mean yeah, it just hurts to see that <em>someone</em> gets to escape the muzzling. Since I can't stop wearing I can at least force you to wear so you aren't a sore for the eyes.</p>
<p>Masking is pointless as fuck. I am deeply disappointed in people (32 of them put those downward-pointing arrows there?) and maybe Bill Gates is right with his depopulation plan. Pretty sure it's these that will be disposed of, not us 200 IQ free thinkers. What those people do a robot can also easily do.</p>

        <p>stop resorting to insults please, if you don't want to wear a mask, you don't have to (unless you go shopping please wear a singular mask then). I really don't care about the health of someone who ignores all respect and goes straight to insults, if you see a comment insulting your opinion (like the one you replied to), take a moment to calm down, report the comment for harrasment and then make your argument  </p>
<p>EDIT: Differing opinions are <em>not</em> insults, so if you see just any old pro-vax comment, there is <em>no</em> need to report it</p>

        <p>If you choose not to wear a mask when shopping, don't wear one. </p>
<p>If you choose to wear one that's fine, simply don't dictate to me about what I should do. If you are scared of me, keep your distance (it isn't difficult).</p>
<p>If you want to be part of a medical experiment, be my guest, but don't berate me if I choose not to partake.</p>
<p>If you're scared of going into a bar, don't go. Do not close them by using the excuse that I'm too stupid to make my own decisions about risk.</p>

        <p>Your use of words like "dictate" and such makes me think you want me to be angry, is this correct because I'll be super calm if you want!</p>
