    <strong>Wuhan Institute of Virology researching a new type of virus found in Xinjiang. Here we go again?</strong>
    <p><p>Ebinur Lake Virus - EBIV</p>
<p>Trials in mice found the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0% - 20% survival rate</li>
<li>Cytopathic effects in vertebrae cells (Structural changes in the host's spines that are caused by viral invasion)</li>
<li>Internal bleeding</li>
<li>"Pathological changes" (They didn't really specify)</li>
</ul>
<p>"In summary, EBIV is a new member of the Bunyamwera serogroup and is able to competently infect cells derived from mosquitoes, rodents, monkeys, or humans. Furthermore, EBIV caused severe disease and even death in challenged Kunming mice, and the antibodies against EBIV have been detected in local residents, indicating that the virus is a potential animal or human pathogen."</p>

<p>So let me get this straight:</p>
<p>The same guys that potentially leaked Covid are now dabbling with another virus. A virus that apparently is more deadly in mice, but it seems as if humans in the area where it was found developed natural antibodies, and therefore it's survivable (But may still damage your spine).</p>
<p>Well, I guess we'll see whether there will be another "whoopsie daisy" incident followed by people clutching their chest and falling to the floor in front of HD cameras. At this point I'm not even sure I am scared anymore. Just sitting here being like "Oh, a sneak preview."</p></p>
