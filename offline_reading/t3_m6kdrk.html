    <strong>So sick of everything being politicized, I’m losing my mind.</strong>
    <p><p>Im so sick of how politicized everything is nowadays. Covid wasn’t the beginning of it but it’s made it 1000x worse. If you don’t agree with one single thing in the hive mind, you’re a monster. </p>
<p>If you’re walking outside alone with no people around for hundreds of yards and you have your mask down, people look at you like you’re a terrorist. </p>
<p>The craziest part is how literally everyone I know was tricked into it. Absolutely zero critical thinking on their part. We just hear “if you don’t wear a mask 24/7 you’re killing people”. Didn’t they prove months ago that masks don’t do shit, only social distancing does- and that asymptomatic people don’t even transmit the virus?</p>
<p>I’ve considered myself a proud liberal my whole life, but now I’m waking up and I feel crazy by everyone else’s standards. If you don’t religiously follow and believe EVERY single thing the liberals say, you’re basically a nazi in their eyes. I’ve noticed this before with other things they believe too that I won’t even get into. They’ve tricked almost everyone I know into believing everything without any scientific evidence- just claiming their own facts. </p>
<p>My family and everyone I know is basically getting vaccinated. I don’t have a problem with whatever they want to do, but they act like anyone who doesn’t want to get vaccinated is some flat earther science denier. I know when my age group is able to get vaccinated, I’m just gonna have to lie and say I got it. </p>
<p>Someone please tell me where I can move to get away from this? I’m so sick of this shit. Can’t even walk outside without EVERY little thing being politicized. Just went on a sprint and pulled your mask down to breathe? You’re literally killing everyone you know lmao.</p></p>

        <p>So these liberals you refer to are not liberals. They used to be, but now they are the actual nazis. Where to move to? I think the only free place in the USA is Florida, but the next election cycle could change that too.</p>

        <p>Also notice how they're ramping up the gender war rhetoric again. That incident with the girl in the UK is being used to warm people up to curfews (men being outside means you aren't safe). This isn't about money anymore, it's about sowing chaos and division any way they can. We have to organize and fight back.</p>

        <p>I’m in the same boat bro. Been really struggling and I usually don’t struggle at all </p>
<p>It’s hard when close friends and family see through the lies but then completely change and sound like different people.  They are scared and they get so far before realising how messed up the world is and go back to the belief that “someone higher up is looking after me/will do it all for me” </p>
<p>What made me feel better was talking to friend at work who also just sees how bullshit everything is and how obvious it is.  We are social beings and this is all just to keep us divided. </p>
<p>Together we could create so much and change soooo much. </p>
<p>But that’s the next plan, get everybody to turn on each other. I mean all you gotta do now is challenge people’s beliefs and you get belittled and slated.</p>

        <p>The only "FREE" areas in the US are Texas and Florida at the moment. Trust me when I say this. EVERYONE will get fed up with this shit. EVERYONE. The longer this goes on, the more people will resist it. And this is part of the plan. To have the people crack and break down the old system so they can bring in the new one. Order out of chaos. They're going to ruin the lives of every single person eventually. By then though, it will be too late. Most will be vaccinated, killed off, or controlled. Western ideals will die off with most western people. This is why most of the "free" countries are having the hardest restrictions. You're not alone. And if you are, it won't be for long.</p>

        <p>Oh so you've noticed countries that have already lost freedom long ago, banana republics, places like that, aren't being as crazy about lockdowns and masking? Like this is conditioning for places with too much personal autonomy? Interesting.</p>

        <p>I like how masks became a political statement. It started with "don't wear a mask it doesn't protect you" to "wear a mask to protect others" and morphed into "wear a mask or else to prove your virtue".</p>

        <p>I think I got lucky with my friend and family. Only one of my family is a die hard doomer. The rest can critically think for themselves and don't buy into all the fear mongering.  My gf got the vaccine but she understands and can see my viewpoint on why I don't want to get it till I can see more data on long term effects.</p>
