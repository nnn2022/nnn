    <strong>Got refused service for the first time tonight</strong>
    <p><p>I go to my mom’s house on Fridays after work and then go out to dinner with her and my stepdad. My mom asked me if I wanted to go to a pub-type restaurant a few minutes from her house and I said sure and made the reservations before driving down.</p>
<p>We get to the restaurant and my stepdad says he forgot his mask. My mom and I are wearing ours and she told him just cover your face with your shirt; it’s only a few steps to wait to be seated and walk to the table. We get to the patio entrance and I gave the waitress my name. She saw my stepdad not wearing a mask and said “You need a mask; masks are required.” My mom said well he just forgot his. The waitress then said “Well we really encourage masks.” So we went from “requiring” masks to “really encouraging” them in less than a minute. (And like I said, my mom and I HAD MASKS and were wearing them. My stepdad just left his at home. We were not making a scene of any kind or yelling or anything.) But the server still wouldn’t seat us so we turned around and left. Once my stepdad went back to the house and grabbed a mask, we went to a different restaurant where we saw two people exit without masks and no one staff member even noticed. We had a nice meal and the table behind us was even celebrating a birthday for an older woman (probably the mother of someone at the table). They had a cake and singing for her and she seemed like she was enjoying it. I said to my mom later “At least they are letting mom/grandma enjoy her life and are bringing her out.” </p>
<p>It’s just so exhausting living like this. Why say masks are required but then say 10 seconds later that you “encourage” them? I understand that restaurants are worried about snitches but is it really that big of a deal if one person doesn’t wear a mask for the 15 seconds it would have taken us to walk to our table? (In PA, the virus is very smart and won’t bother you while you’re sitting at your table but I guess it lurks when you’re walking around.) </p>
<p>I’ve never been a rebellious person, but I really feel like it’s going to take us some sort of revolt to get out of this. The restaurant that wouldn’t seat us lost our business forever and probably $60-$70 checks to go with it.</p></p>

        <p>Not a bad idea. Honestly, if I had been the server, if I had seen two of the three people with masks and one person using a makeshift covering cause they forgot? I would have let it slide.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, we went to this restaurant a few months back when PA initially allowed outdoor dining. My stepdad covered his face with his shirt then and we were still seated and got to eat. Sounds like this waitress was just uppity or clueless. (Especially with the whole “masks are required”/“we encourage masks” flip-flop. Well, they’re either required or they’re not! It doesn’t go both ways.)</p>

        <p>The "wear a mask 0 feet to your table then take it off" schtick is so bad, I'm not sure how anyone can do it with a straight face.</p>
<p>I guess they weren't hurting for money they could afford to lose paying customers. Thats the worst sting. "Hey, I was going to drop coin in your hurting business, but you gave me a hard time about it, so I guess I'll spend elsewhere."</p>
<p>FWIW, I refuse to participate in restaurant mask game. Its all or nothing, and if its nothing you get no money from me.</p>

        <p>I'm so glad you were able to get to another place that was more relaxed and enjoy the evening. It's a crazy time, where seeing some stranger's bare face brings such a sense of relief and joy.</p>
<p>I don't have anything to add, I just wanted to say thank you for sharing the nice anecdote.</p>

        <p>Good for you! You got a self-righteous server with a power trip and so ended up taking your business elsewhere. This is how all this madness is ultimately going to end: when enough of us are willing to follow that quiet voice announcing the emperor has no clothes.</p>

        <p>lol i went to get a donair with my GF and the first place we go to is owned by syrians, a 15ish year old kid is the ONLY employee.</p>
<p>We're standing in a COMPLETELY empty room 20 feet from this kid and I start ordering and he stands there literally frozen with his disgusting stained mask he's been wearing for 6 hours already and mumbles "you need to have masks"</p>
<p>Me and GF say we forget em at home so can we order? Do we go outside and order and you can bring it?  He literally just stands there with his mouth gaping behind his mask for honestly 3 minutes, finally my GF says yea im not fucking kidding we didnt bring masks so are you gonna take our order? Goobers mouth just wordlessly gapes as we leave.  Droolies brain literally couldn't process a single action besides what he is told, pleasantville brainlets follow orders good good.</p>
<p>Drive five minutes down the street to the next donair place, nice greek gentlemen, not wearing a mask, doesn't even mention us wearing one or not, we do business from a normal distance, world fine.  Certainly not surprising that people from places have different views on mask use, i'll certainly take the opinion of the guy from the cradle of democracy and individual will.</p>

        <p>Im in PA as well, only issues around here we ever had were in nursing homes, normal people that werent at the end of their life have been fine. I got harassed at a local target and my gym, but other than that no one has said a word to me about wearing the stupid mask. Good luck out there, its a crazy world and only going to get worse as long as Wolf and Richard are still in power.</p>

        <p>Virtually every death in my county was an elderly person. I can’t believe this is what we were still shut down for. But no we’re getting hysterical about colleges and schools instead even though it’s highly unlikely any of those kids will die. </p>
<p>Not sure where you are in PA but my county has a lot of sheep too. My parents live in a liberal city and I see tons of people walking outdoors alone in masks and obediently wearing masks while they wait in a long line for ice cream. Like come on already!</p>

        <p>I work for a cable company, and install a lot of modems for college kids in Bloomsburg and surrounding areas. Ive been in about 250 different college homes the past month or so, they are all pissed. Especially now that they went full online learning. They could have stayed home and saved thousands but the places wont let them out of their leases. So they are screwed. Ive only had a few jobs the past 5 months that wouldnt let me in their home, but majority are fine with me coming in for installs. 
Seeing people by themselves with masks on is disgusting. Saw a guy yesterday all decked out in his biking gear riding by himself, wearing a mask. I believe people are giving up mentally and just falling for the conditioning the media keeps pushing down their throats.</p>

        <p>Its amazing they shut down because some students and staff tested positive. I ask every install there if testing is mandatory and they said no, they dont know why there are people getting tested. I ask if they know anyone who is sick and they all say no. With as many interactions I have with people I would think I would have gotten sick by now if this virus was so easily spread and dangerous, yet Im fine and never plan on getting tested. If im healthy and not on my death bed why would I ever believe I need testing? boggles my mind why people do this, I guess it keeps the numbers up</p>

church's Chicken.  They wouldn't serve us because we didn't have masks.  We went across the street and got a chicken dinner at Texas Tom's.  Guess where we'll go next time we want chicken.</p>

        <p>So there's a store near me with a "no shirt, no shoes, no service" sign on the door.  I sweat easily, and it's been hotter than the devil's nipples recently, so my shirt got soaked while I was out working.  I took it off.  Then I needed something from the store.</p>
<p>Did I get upset when I got there and realized I needed to go home for a shirt?  Of course not.  In the same situation, though, you've determined it wasn't your (or your stepdad's) fault that you forgot something that is clearly required, posted as such, and so on.  What makes you so special that the requirements don't apply when they're ones you don't like, but requirements you're fine with (like not seeing a fat, sweaty dude walking topless through the local stores) are okay?</p>
<p>There's a serious problem of entitlement here.</p>

        <p>Because the mask policies are unevenly enforced across regions, hell even individual businesses.   You cant blame them for seeking an exception..  i mean after all they are going to be able to take the masks off the whole time they are at the table, contradicting the whole idea of wearing them in the first place.</p>

        <p>And also, as I said in my OP, it’s not like we all showed up maskless and demanded to be seated. My mom and I had masks. I think it’s BS that because one person had their face covered with a shirt for 30 seconds that meant refusing service was justified This particular restaurant has a gate on its patio. You walk through the gate and go a very short distance to your table (patio isn’t that big) and then take the mask off as soon as you’re seated.</p>

        <p>What makes the politicians all around the world so special?  Alot of them atleast in the USA do not even follow the rules that they advocate for the public.  So there actions contradict there words.  And that action makes it clear that all of these 50+ Year old politicians aren’t in any capasity afraid of the virus.   Then i’m not going to be afraid either</p>

        <p>Ironically the "no shirt etc." thing has racist origins. Back when it was first implemented it was to turn away black people who often couldn't afford shoes. Intended to cause racial divide (now why does <em>that</em> sound familiar?). But go off.</p>
