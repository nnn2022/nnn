    <strong>People who buy into the lockdowns are nothing more than computer programs.</strong>
    <p><p>First, this is a very long post, so I don't blame you if you don't want to read. Also, I am not calling these people literal programs, but metaphorical ones. With that out of the way, let's begin:  </p>
<p>For the last year, it has shocked me that the government could say one thing, and people will passionately defend it. And then 2 weeks later (or even in a matter of a few days) the government will say something else that is a COMPLETE CONTRADICTION, and the people will passionately defend it. It's as if the first thing the government said didn't even happen. And that's what blew my mind about it even very early on. It's not that these people had to engage mental gymnastics in order to justify the <em>blatant hypocrisies</em>. It's that they behaved as if there was no hypocrisy in the first place, as if the first thing the government said simply never existed at all. </p>
<p>The prime example of this was the very first lie the government told: "Two weeks to flatten the curve." Does anyone actually remember the details of that? Really think back: a lot of my facebook friends were its most ardent supporters, yet if I were to earnestly make the same exact argument today, they'd likely call me a conspiracy theorist--as if they didn't make the same exact argument last March. The argument: everyone who is going to be infected is going to no matter what... It's not a matter of diminishing the spread, or lowering the cases, it's a matter of spreading those out over time as to not overwhelm the hospitals. That's all it is! We can't slow the spread, we can only flatten it, so we must for the hospitals' sake! </p>
<p>So many on my timeline argued that SO FIERCELY, calling anyone that questioned it a conspiracy theorist, saying it was insane to think that this would lead to a police state or that the government would abuse its new powers. And it began: "Just listen to the science!" they said. The science was clear: we weren't going to shrink the curve, just flatten it. That's all the 2 weeks was about!</p>
<p>Cue two weeks later. Suddenly, MAGICALLY, overnight, the narrative switched entirely. Flatten the curve became "slow the spread". No fanfare or admission of a switch, or even so much as acknowledgment that it was switching. It just flipped. It was no longer about the density of cases over time; suddenly it was about the total number of cases. Even if the hospitals weren't overwhelmed (and they weren't), that no longer mattered because it was now, "if it saves one life." And remember, "listen to the science!" </p>
<p>I have to make a quick aside to really hammer the point about "science" surrounding the coronavirus. In the case of this pandemic, "Science" literally just means "anything the authorities say." An "Expert" is literally just anyone that agrees with the narrative. We know this because any expert or any science that disagrees with the narrative is no longer an expert and is no longer science--it's suddenly and magically "conspiracy theory". Anyway...</p>
<p>When this first magic switch initially happened, I noticed right away. I noticed that the entire narrative was flipped over and completely changed and that, surprise, surprise, the government didn't give us our liberty back! But what happened to the "flatten the curve"? Before the switch, that was EVERYWHERE--IT WAS THE BEATING HEART OF THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION SURROUNDING LOCKDOWN. So where did it go? IT VANISHED after those two weeks, and suddenly everyone argued SO FIERCELY about "if it saves even one life" and "slowing the spread." If you tried to bring up the "flatten the curve" thing to people, it wasn't even just that they denied it, it's like they outright didn't compute. It's as if you were speaking a foreign language. It was as if that argument <em>never existed at all.</em> </p>
<p>This is why trying to point out the hypocrisies and contradictions doesn't work on people. Because they don't compute. To them, there was no contradiction, because the newest narrative is the ONLY NARRATIVE in their minds.</p>
<p>And this went much further than the initial "flatten the curve" contradiction. Let's list just a few: you don't need to wear a mask, until you do. Wearing a mask is important, until wearing two masks is important. Holiday gatherings are super spreader events, but mass protests actually could SLOW the spread! A Democratic rally is fine, but a Republican one threatens to murder your grandma. 2 Million people are going to die by the end of May, but only 100k people dying by the end of June is catastrophic and worse than we could have ever imagined. CA will lock down counties with less than 15% available ICU capacity, except the state isn't using that as its metric and rather using some wonky "equity" metric, and if a country has less than 1 case per 100k residents, it's still locked down. The reason so many people didn't die is because of the lockdowns, but the only reason we're still in the lockdowns is because no one complied with the lockdowns. This list could go on and on and on. </p>
<p>And, what is the one thing that binds all of the "doomers" together: they cannot compute any of this. They don't even try to justify it because it doesn't occur to them. Whatever the authorities--the "science"--says RIGHT NOW is simply the way it IS, and apparently has always been. </p>
<p>Finally, we get to my original point: how does all of this make people computer software? Because, software simply does what its programming tells it to do. And the constant switching of narratives is like software updates. Whenever the government changes its narrative, all it is is an update for its obedient programs. If you make a major change in a program--let's say that you have a game and switch out the texture of a model to a brand new texture--the game updates and the new texture simply just is. As far as the game is concerned, it's as if the old texture never existed. The game is updated. The program runs on the coding with which it has been provided. </p>
<p>And people are no different now. Their coding is that which the government tells them. It doesn't matter if the government tells them something that completely contradicts something it says even a day ago; the new thing is an update. The person (the program) overwrites the old coding with the new, and the new coding is simply "the way it is". The reason they cannot acknowledge or identity the old narratives is because those narratives no longer exist in their coding. They have been overwritten. Once the old texture has been replaced with the new and deleted, that old texture no longer exists within a program.</p>
<p>So yeah... People are computer programs. And, let's face it... they're pretty simple programs at that.</p></p>
