        <p>So angry. </p>
<p>I did catch covid. Wasn't a big deal. I've got my natural immunity now, so I'm not stressed.</p>
<p>I'm very curious what would cause someone to create an alt account and troll a random subreddit though. That's some truly cowardly behavior. I hope you get past whatever is troubling so and you can try to grow as a person.</p>

        <p>So, I don't believe you, but that's fine.</p>
<p>My wife and I had it, and spread it to no other people to our knowledge. Things were pretty locked down at the time, so there was very little contact with other people.</p>
<p>That said, my health is my responsibility, and yours is yours. You won't guilt me (or anybody for that matter) for unknowingly spreading a contagious disease. That's just life. If you want to live in a safety bubble for the rest of your life, you can feel free to, but you coming in here and trying to convince others to do the same is convincing exactly zero people. It's the most wasteful use of your time that I can imagine.</p>
<p>Anyhow, good luck with your rage. Maybe spend more time on that than on trying to control other people's bodies. It would be both healthier, and more productive.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of cesspool subs for sure. Honest question though: what do you find misleading about the post in question that would lead you think that it’s deserving of 85+ downvotes? Are we to trust only the CDC and not consider big pharma’s role in silencing any concerns about what seems to be an increasingly nefarious plot?</p>

        <p>As someone who lives an active life, and cooks 95% of all the food I eat with a low sugar diet I'd say I'm already doing what you said. That's the reason I don't need this particular vaccine that has not passed its long term effect studies.</p>

        <p>Everyone died of the virus? I thought you were just talking about trusting the experts in a few earlier comments.. the experts have published the deaths and if you look at the numbers, average mortality age from covid is <em>older</em> than the average life expectancy. </p>
<p>The absolute vast majority of people have strong enough immune systems to fight off the common cold, which is basically the same as covid.</p>

        <p>I can answer that, nobody I've come in to contact with has died of covid. Nobody at all in my town has died of it. </p>
<p>On average, most people don't know a single person (online "friendships" don't count) that has died directly of covid. </p>
<p>So the answer to your question? I will feel 100% fine, in fact I feel like I am doing the right thing considering I know of more people who have had quite negative reactions to these vaccines than those of covid.</p>

        <p>You have no clue if you spread it to others who died, there is no way you could. It could have been someone you don't know that you passed in a store who was passing through town.

        <p>There have been 1700 total deaths from people <em>with</em> covid in my entire province. This includes people who have died of unrelated things but also had covid. The overwhelming majority of these deaths has been in care homes for the elderly. A few have been in the intensive care units from people who already had severe medical issues. That leaves like 50 people out and about day to day in an area over twice the size of California.</p>
<p>The chances of me even ever seeing one of them from a distance is so incredibly small that I can say with pretty high certinty I have not passed it on and killed anyone.</p>
<p>You can call bullshit all you want, I don't even believe you're a real person based on your insane opinions. Go around and talk to people face to face and I bet you will struggle to find more than a handful that actually believes this virus is deadly. I for one only know of 2 people that are scared of it. </p>
<p>I went to a 200+ attendance wedding mid covid, where a few had tested positive before hand. EVERY person in there was fine, including all of the grandparents. We all caught covid, we all accepted it, we all didn't even know we had the virus due to there being zero symptoms. A positive test was literally the only reason I can tell you I had it. I have had the common cold many times in the past, and it's been worse every time.</p>

        <p>It makes me mad that we hold everyone besides our leaders accountable for their decisions that could inflict harm on people. The government is telling us that unvaccinated people are a cancer on public health while they do little to protect the health of its citizens. They want us to trust that this time is different, and that the reason they're sending officials to our doorsteps to plug the vax and partitioning those who refuse it is to protect public health. Bullshit.</p>
