<p>Even if 7.7k or so died per month, and that tend continues, fewer people will have died in Sweden, without masks, without lockdowns, than in 2018, or other high casualty years.</p>

        <p>It’s so blatant. This should be the final nail in the lockdown and covid coffin. They don’t even have mask mandates. Very lax lockdown approach and yet no excess death.</p>
<p>I’m guessing they’ll say the Swedes are aliens that are naturally resistant to covid.</p>

        <p>The funny thing is the only way lockdowns could be proven to have worked, would be if Sweden was #1 in deaths across the board. </p>
<p>In deaths per million for the past 7 days, they're #48.</p>

        <p>Tbf it's but just YouTube I'm talking about videos in general. Whenever you sit down and listen to another opinion without breaks or pauses, you're thrown a torrent of information that your brain typically cannot fully analyse and think about. Especially if it's a long video. A good way to showcase this, is to find an hour, or even half hour long video on a topic you disagree on. Watch it all without stopping, then write down your counterpoints. </p>
<p>Watch it a second time, this time pausing anytime you can think of a counterpoint, or counterargument. You'll find the list you made while pausing, is longer than the other list. </p>
<p>I personally like old fashioned text, articles you can read at any pace, and have time to fully absorb. </p>
<p>This is also a huge issue when you watch something/someone you agree with. As you'll be less likely to tell if they exagerate, or straight up lie. You can also get opinions mixed up as fact. </p>
<p>Finally, I also dislike videos as they're far harder to share. If I want to make a point all I need to do is copy paste like this</p>
<p><a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/">biden supports the GND</a></p>
<p>Without specifying the exact point in the article, you can find the relevant info with a simple ctrl+F. Unlike a video where the poster needs to ensure they have the video at the right minutes/seconds. </p>
<p>Then there's audio. I hate when I have to listen to audio from a video. I do not like having to stop listening to music/watching tv in order to see some funny guy yodeling or hear some argument that I could have just read in a hyperlink. </p>
<p>Actually finally this time, I find articles far more professional and persuasive. If you link to a video, you're argument is "go watch this guy, he's who I base my facts on.". That derails the conversation, and brings into question the validity of his claims. It's a bit like using Wikipedia. Cut out the middle man and give me the info from the source. </p>
<p>With articles, not only can you post an undeniable truth in a way they can't argue, you can do so in such a way your own character cannot show it in a negative light. Such as </p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p>No matter how much someone tried to bring up my post history, belittle spelling errors, etc. They cannot attack the source which is a direct source to a paper. It's claim is essentially infallible (unless the source is full of shit), however it still means no matter how much mud they fling, they cannot dirty your facts.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this turned into a little rant. Sorry for that haha.</p>

        <p>Nah, that’s a good reply. </p>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly with all of your points. I also prefer reading and like having the actual text that I can share bits from with all of the references hyperlinked. It feels more solid and definitive. </p>
<p>It’s why I like listening to the Corbett Report where he always provides a full transcript with sources on his documentaries. We need more people to do that. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I fear we are in the minority here who want to read. Vast majority of the public cannot be bothered to put the time and read an article, especially one that requires critical thought. Most people have been conditioned by clickbait and catchy headlines in this age of social media. You can see that by just flicking through Reddit and reading the comments; most people don’t bother even reading the article posted before writing their opinions on it.</p>

        <p>Oh, didn't know he had transcripts. That makes it far better. </p>
<p>We definitely are in the minority. You can tell by how popular v.reddit links are vs gfycat or other .gif links. However, we're also the only ones that can reasonably sway opinions. Even if the person you argue against isn't giving in, if you stay calm, cool, and collected while ignoring underhanded tactics like insults or character assassination attempts, you have the possibility of swaying the 3rd party reader who sees you as a voice of reason, and the other guy as a deranged lunatic.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you’re right. Even if we don’t sway the person we are arguing against, hopefully the third party is open minded enough to check out the links and facts that we are displaying and linking. I’ve had some discussions (that turned into arguments) where the other part quickly devolved into using insults and ad hominem attacks because they couldn’t discredit the factual information I had linked. </p>

        <p>Reddit is so controlled! I commented on a post asking if they should call the police on an outdoor football game in their local park for having too many people and said they should mind their own business and I was permanently banned. The people who hang round here attacking us don't get banned, and I wasn't even attacking. I broke no rules, so there's definitely a bigger agenda at play here.</p>

        <p>Masks aren't proven to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/">Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p>The CDC doesn't even consider them PPE.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are a last resort. Yet they've been used as a first resort.</p>
<p>Up to 500k Canadians may have missed important doctor appointments that would have told them they had cancer. As a result of the delay their changes of survival are lowered.</p>

<p>Maybe you could use your brain and think about why a country doesn't have mandatory mask enforcement and lockdowns, aka, what my comment is actually commenting on</p>

        <p>Whenever I mention Sweden to someone they'll say it's not comparable because they have a much lower population density (than the UK), and that that explains their successes.</p>

        <p>Going by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Sweden#:~:text=63%25%20of%20Swedes%20are%20in,million%20in%20the%20metropolitan%20area).">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;  87% of the population live in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area.</p>
<p>So while the country does have a relatively large area and a relatively small population, most people are in fact living in places where they're likely to come into contact other people pretty frequently.</p>
<p>I guess could quibble that this is, well, Wikipedia and what the heck  exactly is an "urban area" and maybe some other things, but simply taking total population and dividing by land area is clearly an unreasonable metric, I'd think.</p>

        <p>Then you can point them to less densely populated than Sweden countries like Argentina. 
Argentina has over 35,000 deaths with covid. </p>
<p>Sweden - deaths 6,164
Argentina deaths - 35,436</p>
<p>Sweden population density - 159th most densely populated
Argentina population density - 173th most densely populated </p>
<p>Sweden population - 10,099,265
Argentina population - 45,355,162</p>
<p>Sweden deaths per million - 599.29
Argentina deaths per million - 788.54 </p>
<p>https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-argentina-covid-hot-spot-lockdown</p>
<p>Argentina has had one of the strictest and longest lockdowns and mask mandate. Sweden had some restrictions but overall mostly recommendations and no mask mandate. </p>

        <p>That population density can be a factor but so can a myriad of other things that are seemingly ignored.</p>
<p>Also find the death stats adjusted for population, Sweden is currently number 20 on the list Vs UK which is number 9. </p>
<p>Even if that is hand-waved using population density ask them if they honestly think the population of Sweden is homogeneously distributed across the country's area. There's lot of uninhabited land in Sweden, just by looking on a map you can see this.<br>
Population density is an okay metric in some fields but when looking at wider areas it has it's limits. Example for now; you could compare Stockholm to London taking into account population density and that'd be more useful than comparing UK overall population density to Sweden as you'd be comparing two cities with more limited areas than whole countries.</p>
<p>Basically when looking at a metric you want to be sure it is comparing like for like.</p>

        <p>They closed down certain venues like museums. Students 17, 18 and in higher education transferred to online learning and people who could work from home were recommended to do so. They also reduced public gatherings to 50. They prohibited visiting old people’s homes. </p>
<p>In comparison to the rest of the world, it’s a very lax approach. They recommended social distancing and for people to use common sense but they never made it a law that is punishable.</p>

        <p>Then you're cherry picking without providing concrete reasoning though...</p>
<p>That means you're admitting any country with less deaths per million than Sweden did better <em>because</em> of their measures. That's far from rendering "lockdowns" useless.</p>

        <p>Except that's not how it works. Keep in mind, if lockdowns had any effect on deaths, Sweden would have to be #1. Afterall a virus with "expenential growth"  is running unchecked withn the population. Yet...</p>
<p>https://imgur.com/a/ewz5nfq</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind Sweden is on track to have had 0 effect on their yearly deaths. This would imply that those who did die, likely would have died this year regardless. That's what this post is about.</p>
<p>Deaths/million from the WuFlu is irrelevant, if there are no excess deaths. If Sweden has 11000 deaths from November 8th to December 31st, that ties them for deaths they had last year, and those 6000 dead people didn't affect the total at all. </p>
<p>Even if 15000 die, they're tied for 2018. Last I checked there wasn't a global pandemic in 2018, so Sweden still didn't have excess deaths. </p>
<p>Sweden needs up to 21000 people to die by the end of the year for the WuFlu to have actually killed the 6000 claimed, independently as to what would have happened this year.</p>

        <p>They will try saying that the flu was stopped because Swedes decided to wear masks anyhow. </p>
<p>Regardless, use it where you can. 11k deaths gets then equal to 2019. 15k deaths gets them equal to highest of the decade. 21k deaths is what they need, in 2 months, to prove that all 6k claimed WuFlu deaths (so far) actually happened to people who weren't going to die this year anyhow. </p>
<p>I can't see 10.5k swedes dying per month. I can hardly see 7k dying per month. Sweden is on track to have their lowest amount of deaths this decade <em>without a lockdown</em>.</p>

        <p>Just throw math at him. Even if you extrapolate 7k dead/month, that'll be a rise of 14k by years end. That's Under 2018 deaths. </p>
<p>However, compared to 2019, that's 3k extra deaths. Half of the claimed WuFlu deaths in Sweden <em>so far</em>. Which would imply half of those that died of the WuFlu, would have died this year anyhow. And that's a minimum number. It's litterally 50% or 100%, if there's no major changes. </p>
<p>Math is essentially the closest we have to a settled science, so it's the best tool we have to show these doomers the truth.</p>

        <p>The problem with your statements is that the CoVid-19 is taking out people in relatively good health or sterling health like my mother.</p>
<p>When that is the case, yes: A lot of these deaths are 'excess deaths' because without these people catching the CoVid-19, they would have been alive for another 10-20 years most likely.</p>

<p>The vast majority who die are old and at risk. Yes, a handful of young healthy people will die. That's part of life. I'm sorry for you loss, but that's not an argument for a country wide lockdown. 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular issues, yet no one bans McDonald's.</p>
<p>We can literally see that Sweden is unlikely to have excess deaths at the end of the year while doing nothing.</p>

        <p>Sweden saw a rash of hospitalizations early on, but it trailed off quickly. There was still a lot of anxiety in Sweden over Covid. People were likely being much more cautious than during a normal flu season. The fact that the deaths have not spiked is the important point.</p>

        <p>The deaths are high compared to other Scandinavian countries, and the hospitalisation rate is currently rapidly increasing because people are starting to slack of. And no, people don't get put in intensive care because of "anxiety". They get put there if they really need it, and if thats not the case i would like the source on that.</p>

        <p>I beg to disagree. People do go in for anxiety. Granted it's difficult to prove the numbers, but consider what this nurse has to say: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=359">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=359</a></p>
<p>About the death rates, note that 2019 was a record low year for Sweden. One would expect Sweden's death rate to be higher than normal even if 2020 were a normal year.</p>
<p>The point isn't that <em>no one is dying</em>, the point is that when you compare 2020 with other years, there is no significant spike in the death rate that would warrant the near destruction of society through lockdowns, social distancing, and other mandates.</p>

        <p>People do seek medical care for anxiety, that i do not dispute, but they are not getting intensive care because they want to. Proffesional doctors make that decision. And there are many signs that the hospitals are becoming overwhelmed, which might take years to restore because of all the operations being delayed in favor for covid patients. People dying is not the only bad thing, it's the strain it puts on the hospitals that plays a big part. You have to look at the numbers of people being cared for as well.</p>

        <p>Something you're leaving out is the data of every Nordic country in that area. Yes, Sweden has less deaths, but you know who has even less than that? Denmark, Finland and Norway. Sweden has 6,164 deaths - the others have 756, 369, and 294 respectively. If you compared Sweden and America in terms of Covid death rates, and adjusted the populations to account for Sweden's much lower count, America would have 246k deaths while Sweden would have 198k. This would make Sweden the second most deadly country worldwide. This speaks nothing about what would happen if we used the same equation on the flat contraction rate.</p>

        <p>If Sweden doesn't get 11k deaths, they end the year without a death excess. As a result no more people will have died this year than last in a country without lockdowns or mask mandates. This means every single death from the WuFlu, statistically, would have happened regardless of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Even if 14k die in these 2 months, rust means half their 6000 death count would have died this year anyhow.</p>

        <p>Sweden isn't the only country with universal healthcare. Morso, this implies that WuFlu deaths in Sweden were irrelevant over the course of the year, and even though they apparently number 6k, didn't kill anyone who wouldn't have died this year anyhow</p>
