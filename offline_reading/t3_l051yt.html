    <strong>How do you resist?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone, first of all I just wanna say that I'm glad I found this subreddit full of people that I feel atleast have a brain in their cranium. I am also a skeptic of lockdown and covid 19 measures, and I don't want any of this "no new normal" . However, I am asking myself a question : how the hell are we even supposed to resist this?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>- I can't not wear a mask : at this point, not wearing a mask would get me kicked out of stores, evicted out of my university, maybe even my appartement. What choice do I have?</p>
<p>- I can about it with barely anyone : my family and most of my friends agree to some degree with me, however anyone else just lashes out in pure hatred and anger at the pure thought of "questioning" the measures imposed on us. I can't really see a therapist, because I'm pretty sure it's going to be the same drill.</p>
<p>- There is no way of political protests : I know most people on this sub are americans , and althought the situation there is deteriorating imo, the situation in my country is ten times worse. The national assembly has been almost dissolved, peaceful protests have been outlawed, and so on. The vaccines are going to be mandatory for everyone and they are not even going to be given by regular doctors or anything. </p>
<p>So I was wondering how the hell do you guys resist this?</p></p>

        <p>I'm nearly at the point where I want to let them self destruct and let society collapse. Maybe the liberal fascists will be completely discredited and we can rebuild better based on liberty principles. I don't know, I'm pretty demoralized to be honest.</p>

        <p>Mentally.  They can't take away who you are as a person.  Find like minded people like the ones on this sub.  Read and listen to them.  Help build others up when you can. Educate yourself so when a 'Covid Karen' comes along you have facts to argue against their positions that they can't shoot holes in.  Look it's a simple fact that 'they' can't keep lockdowns going forever.  How are 'they' going to get tax dollars to get richer with if we're all locked down and can't work?  They have to take the noose off of most of use sooner or later to one degree or another then find like minded people to be around.  Fortunately where I live we're about 99% like minded on all this bullshit.  So it's not really a problem for me but I've lived in big cities most of my life and I can see how it could become very reprehensible to live with all the restrictions.</p>

        <p>There is literally no point arguing with these people. Absolutely nothing makes sense in their arguments, and everytime you say something logical they scream like apes. </p>
<p>'They' are already making us consume just as much with amazon and food delivery systems. And like in my country, the govt can just add a lockdown that doesn't close work down, but closes literally everything else. No more small shops, no more restaurants, no more culture. Keep a population that is scared, still consumes, has less and less culture and education and is easier to control.</p>
<p>By God, I wish I lived wherever you do.</p>

        <p>It's a small shit hole town in the middle of nowhere TX but we're not dealing with the shit the rest of the world is.  Most people here have some good common sense.  Got a fever?  Stay home. Got COVID?  Self isolate for 14 days.  Want to wear a mask?  Good for you.  Want me to wear a mask for you to feel safer? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAA.. no.  Only place I HAVE to wear one is at work and I don't do that 70% of the time.</p>

        <p>you know I always kind of giggled at doomsday preppers but I think now it might be a good idea to not only stockpile some long term storage food items like MRE's etc, get armed, and get trained in not only self defense but real firearm combat training.  Maybe this will blow over eventually maybe it won't. But I see a very disturbing trend of people being willing to give up liberty for 'life' and I'm not very fond of it.  Fortunately I'm prepared and while I'm not 'current' I can defend myself and my family if need be.</p>

        <p>Sure. Try and defend yourself from an entire army. That's not what they're going to do anyways. Direct violence is never their option. This isn't the soviet union. Things like this are done throught slow, progressive, total enslavement. </p>

        <p>Sounds like you may be from France.  If so, it appears about time for more yellow vests type protests.  I admired what the French people did during the fuel tax protests.</p>
<p>&rt; peaceful protests have been outlawed</p>
<p>Fuck that shit - that would cause me to protest even more!  I would be peaceful, civilly disobedient, and be as much of a troublemaker that I could be.  You are a human, dammit, and therefore have rights as such.</p>
<p>Seek out like minds.  Keep true to one's own self. (I am honestly shocked that there are not any medical exemptions for masks in France. I have one here in the US due to a childhood trauma that all came back to the forefront, in the form of PTSD anxiety, when the masking started.) There is a huge backlash against the mandatory vaccine in France, become part of that movement.  Refuse, peacefully resist (anyway you can), and stand up for yourself. Just say "Enough of this tyrannical shit! I'm not accepting it anymore!"</p>
<p>Good luck friend, my thoughts are with you.</p>
