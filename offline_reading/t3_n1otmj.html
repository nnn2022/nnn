    <strong>r/coronavirus finally banned me...</strong>
    <p><p>"Not faked but overcounted.</p>
<p>It's not a conspiracy theory or anything either.  Look at how it's counted per the CDC page.
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm</p>
<p>You can speculate as to why they were so loose with the counting the deaths but the fact remains that there are is an unknown number greater than zero of the official covid deaths that were people who would have died regardless of testing positive or just being a "probable" case."</p>

        <p>Welcome to the club friend. Was banned many many months ago for simply asking questions that went against the narrative.</p>
<p>They don't like when people ask questions or bring up uncomfortable truths.</p>

        <p>I was just responding to somebody who said "One of my coworkers is convinced that most of the stats aren't real "</p>
<p>This is a pretty blatant banning based on wrongthink so I'm going to appeal and see what happens.</p>

        <p>They love to ban users for "trolling" </p>
<p>And their definition of trolling is, "Anything I don't like, especially if the comment contains a trace of sarcasm."</p>
<p>I've never seen such asshole mods before.</p>
<p>I got permabanned for making a remark about how the CDC isn't lifting guidelines for vaccinated people in response to a dude who was excited to "slut it up" after being vaccinated.  That's apparently "trolling."</p>
<p>Then when I asked why the mods banned my comment, but nobody else's (the thread was full of sarcastic comments), they responded by banning the other ones too.</p>

        <p>I see this shit ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p>They act awful and get their ban and then go cry about it in their safe space (like I am doing here, haha) but they  are blatantly lying about why they were banned because nobody ever looks it up and they get away with it.</p>
<p>So much dishonesty.  They think all of this fucked up behavior is justified because they are on some kind of virtuous crusade.</p>
<p>Look at this post.  They consider this a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNoNewNormal/comments/mjafic/im_calling_this_the_no_new_normal_war/">"war"</a> which the mods apparently are endorsing since the post has been up for almost a month and comments are locked indicating that the mods have seen the post which implies they endorse the message.</p>

        <p>Yes, you may be downvoted, but your comment isn't removed or banned... And of course if you insult anyone it's breaking this subs rules of being respectful. Keep asking questions. If you come at from a "seeking to understand" standpoint you might be successful in learning something important.</p>

        <p>I got banned from there too just for suggesting folks seek medical advice from dr vs asking if certain raging side effects were “normal” of reddit people. Know others as well...  that sub is reckless frankly. Forget pro or anti vax. People on there are not doctors.  And some reported side effects are nasty and probably at least some of then dangerous and no one who is not officially doing medical consult should be giving advice. They should be banned... for not being licensed and goving medical advice.</p>

        <p>I don't post there all that much I guess.  I figured they would have banned me long ago if they were just banning wrongthink.  I figure a hater recognized me from this sub and reported my comment.   Seems like people started recognizing me now lately.</p>

        <p>They're definitely overcounting and misattributing causes of death to COVID, but am I reading this correctly?  https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Excess-Deaths-Associated-with-COVID-19/xkkf-xrst/data April 17, 2021 total excess lower estimate in 2020: 560k.  That seems extremely high with 575k Americans dead from COVID.  COVID's hyped up like an actual plague, but its death numbers weren't pumped that hard.</p>
<p>Or is it counting things that aren't directly COVID but are related to the lockdowns, like suicides?  How should I be reading this?</p>
