        <p>Cuomo is a cold blooded murderer. Son of a bitch deserves to rot in hell for killing those grandma’s legitimately. He knew what would happen and did it anyway, and now he’s getting fucking rewards? GTFO out of here, he was just testing how fucking stupid people were, and it worked.</p>

        <p>No, he did not and you fail to mention that all of those people that he sent to the nursing homes were out of the 2 week period where they were supposedly able to spread this virus.</p>
<p>I don't think honestly that Cuomo sending these people to these nursing homes lead to these outbreaks. I think someone from the hospitals or some nursing home worker got CoVid-19 from their relatives or friends and then took it to the nursing homes, spreading it there.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: That directive that is mentioned in this meme has actually been shown to have no effect on the death rate in nursing homes. The directive was initiated a week before the peak of deaths in nursing homes, and considering it can take 2 weeks to become ill from COVID as well as even longer to actually die from it, it is highly unlikely that this caused many additional deaths. The directive was also implemented near the peak since there was a concern that hospitals would be overrun, and if that were the case it might have saved many more lives. There was also the problem that nursing homes would have the supplies to deal with this, while some did many were underfunded and short of supplies. Not only that but this was not Cuomo's idea, this was a federal directive that many states who had siginifcant surges in the spring also implemented. While Cuomo could have done more to limit the spread sooner, he did succeed in keeping the cases down after the initial surge and made New York the safest state to live in (In terms of COVID) for the entire summer and begging of fall. His response was not perfect but it was still effective, and if you want someone to blame for this directive, blame the federal government who recommended it.</p>

        <p>Exactly! “Fun fact, a whole bunch of old people died! Oh and it wasn’t Cuomo’s fault. He won an Emmy!” 
But fuck Trump for course, he let 200,000 die, am I right?</p>

<p>" In addition, it’s unclear the extent to which the governor’s policy was responsible for nursing home COVID-19 deaths. Infection control is a long-standing problem in nursing homes, predating the pandemic, and a report showed peak numbers of nursing home deaths came prior to the peak influx of patients as a result of Cuomo’s advisory. While the introduction of COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes no doubt had an effect on infection spread, Caputo’s statement suggests it was solely responsible. That’s not what the evidence shows. "</p>

<p>" "There are over a dozen states that did the exact same thing, many of whom were concerned about hospital capacity. ... Obviously any death is an unfortunate death," DeRosa said, listing the totals from other states amongst New York's. "It's been a national and international tragedy that everybody has had to grapple with and it is something that we're trying to learn from every day and move forward." "</p>
<p>" The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/3-13-2020-nursing-home-guidance-covid-19.pdf">memorandum on March 13</a> stating, in part, "Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present."

        <p>AS IF you would cite Politifact as your source. Of course you would. Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>I’m just going to pick apart your argument piece by piece with actual sources.</p>
<p>&rt; That directive that is mentioned in this meme has actually been shown to have no effect on the death rate in nursing homes.The directive was initiated a week before the peak of deaths in nursing homes</p>
<p>You’re spewing out random, unspecific time frames with zero dates.</p>
<p>The policy in question was enacted March 25: </p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20200331025036/https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/03/doh_covid19-<em>nhadmissionsreadmissions</em>-032520.pdf </p>
<p>and only after being heavily criticized was rescinded on May 10: </p>
<p>https://nypost.com/2020/05/10/hospitals-cant-discharge-coronavirus-patients-to-nursing-homes-cuomo/</p>
<p>Meaning it was in effect for 6 1/2 weeks.</p>
<p>&rt; and considering it can take 2 weeks to become ill from COVID as well as even longer to actually die from it, it is highly unlikely that this caused many additional deaths.</p>
<p>Since ALL of these patients are coming from the hospital AFTER testing positive... they are then shedding the virus for 14 days afterwards and are certainly shedding the moment they arrive at nursing home. Even if they are 2-13 days into their infection when they arrive. Mild symptoms or no symptoms they are shedding. 
So they are very capable of spreading the virus the moment they set foot in the facility. 
This went on for 6 1/2 weeks of patients coming in and spreading the virus around. 
It doesn’t matter WHEN people end up dying from it - if were infected during these 6 1/2 weeks and go on to die after that time frame, they’ve still been infected DURING the time frame. 
Peak deaths is irrelevant and I’m baffled as to why you even think that’s a point to be made. So if someone dies after the peak deaths they didn’t actually die or don’t count?</p>
<p>&rt;The directive was also implemented near the peak since there was a concern that hospitals would be overrun, and if that were the case it might have saved many more lives.</p>
<p>Then why were field hospitals were left unused and shut down? </p>
<p>"NEW YORK — Gleaming new tent hospitals sit empty on two suburban New York college campuses, never having treated a single coronavirus patient." </p>
<p>https://nypost.com/2020/04/30/many-field-hospitals-went-largely-unused-will-be-shut-down/</p>
<p>"NEW YORK — A temporary field hospital built for $21 million as the coronavirus outbreak threatened to overrun medical facilities in New York has closed without ever seeing a patient.</p>
<p>Plans to transform the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal into a temporary 670-bed hospital were announced March 31, a day after the USNS Comfort hospital ship arrived to help coronavirus patients. Officials also announced a tennis center in Queens would be converted into a 350-bed facility.</p>
<p>The tennis center opened as a medical facility April 11 when there were 12,184 patients in hospital beds being treated across the city. It cost $19.8 million to renovate and revert the tennis center. It closed earlier this month after taking in 79 patients.
The Brooklyn hospital, built by SLSCO, a Texas-based construction company, was supposed to open in April but was not ready for patients until May 4, The City reported. By then, hospital use had been sliced in half, to about 6,000 patients. It closed last week without ever having a patient.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to pay the costs for both hospitals.</p>
<p>The two field hospitals were not the only emergency medical facilities in New York that saw limited use.</p>
<p>The Comfort left New York after about a month and treating 182 patients, of which about 70% had the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Several other field hospitals were built across New York for nearly $350 million. They closed in April without seeing any patients, The Associated Press reported."</p>
<p>https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/21-million-hospital-built-coronavirus-victims-new-york-closes-without-ever-seeing-patient/Q3MJKWG3ENB23N3NPR7CVTWOIU/</p>
<p>So that argument is moot. There was no need to send covid positive elderly people to nursing homes like a lit match to dry tinder. None.</p>
<p>&rt;this was not Cuomo's idea, this was a federal directive that many states who had siginifcant surges in the spring also implemented.”</p>
<p>The Federal directive was that they been sent to care homes ONLY with proper isolation facilities, staff and PPE. And that was not was happening. </p>
<p>Here’s what was happening: </p>
<p>Already on March 26th (one day after the directive was issued), The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine wrote a letter essentially begging Cuomo to reverse his decision knowing how dangerous the disease was to the frail and elderly: </p>
<p>"Unsafe transfers will increase the risk of transmission in post-acute and long-term care facilities which will ultimately only serve to increase the return flow back to hospitals, overwhelming capacity, endangering more healthcare personnel, and escalating the death rate. </p>
<p>Nor can the New York State Department of Health override Federal directives set forth by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which stipulate that such decisions to accept a patient be made with the understanding that the facility can safely care for such patients.</p>
<p>Rather than bullying nursing facilities and medical providers to make unsafe decisions, the State of New York would be wise to direct its energies at ensuring adequate personal protective equipment is available to all healthcare providers, ramping up needed testing capabilities, shortening test turnaround times, developing a long-neglected healthcare workforce, and identifying and standing up alternative care sites.”</p>
<p>https://paltc.org/sites/default/files/Statement%20on%20the%20March%2025%20NYSDOH%20Advisory.pdf</p>
<p>This means that unlike what you are saying, New York was actually going AGAINST federal directives laid out by the CDC to absolutely NOT send covid positive patients to facilities that were ill-equipped, lacked proper isolation areas, lacked PPE and lacked staff. And according to this letter, they were being bullied into taking the patients to begin with at the behest of the State of New York.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s response: </p>
<p>"Gov. Cuomo doubled down Sunday on the state’s controversial directive ordering nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients. The governor — who himself has described nursing homes as a “feeding frenzy’’ for the deadly coronavirus — said that the facilities can’t challenge a state regulation forcing them to admit patients with the contagion."</p>
<p>https://nypost.com/2020/04/26/cuomo-doubles-down-on-sending-coronavirus-patients-to-nursing-homes/</p>
<p>&rt;While Cuomo could have done more to limit the spread sooner, he did succeed in keeping the cases down after the initial surge and made New York the safest state to live in (In terms of COVID) for the entire summer and begging of fall. His response was not perfect but it was still effective,</p>
<p>Coronaviruses are seasonal. Cuomo did not keep the cases down after the initial surge, the climate did.</p>
<p>&rt;and if you want someone to blame for this directive, blame the federal government who recommended it.</p>
<p>We already established this is not necessary as this was 100% a Cuomo decision alone, therefore, the meme stands.</p>
<p>The thing that amazes me most about people like you is I bet you go around chanting "not one death" and "protect the elderly" for likes on facebook, but when it actually comes down to it... and real people are actually dying because of one man's insistence on enacting a stupid, ill-conceived and outright murderous policy... you stand behind him because it's what the MSM media has told you to do. In the face of overwhelming evidence and FACTS against him.</p>
