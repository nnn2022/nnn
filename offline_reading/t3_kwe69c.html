        <p>What? I'm confused what you are trying to say. People in my country at least are still allowed to support disabled loved ones and famine related to lockdown is related more to people unnecessarily hoarding food rather than the actual restrictions.</p>

        <p>Your country is lucky; here there's no such provision unless other arbitrary requirements are met. The famine is because people across the developing world are being denied access to food to 'stop the spread:' https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/12000-people-day-could-die-covid-19-linked-hunger-end-year-potentially-more-disease.</p>

        <p>Well firstly while you might only get mildly sick, many people with health conditions and those who are elderly can die from it. 
Secondly many people on this subreddit say it doesn't exist, that's why i made this post.
Thirdly im triggered by it because you are putting other people in danger by refusing to follow rules.</p>

<p>Correct. So protect them, and take personal precautions and personal responsibility in order to keep safe. Let others do the same, to whatever extent they see fit.</p>
<p>&rt;many people on this subreddit say it doesn't exist</p>
<p>In a legitimate, non-meme, non-ironic, non-trolling way? Doubtful. Let alone painting the sub with a broad brush and saying <strong>many</strong>. This entire sub is founded on realizing that the virus is very real, and simply being against the measures taken to combat it. Can guarantee the vast majority of those here certainly realize it's very real.</p>
<p>&rt;you are putting other people in danger by refusing to follow rules.</p>
<p>I hope you've never driven above the speed limit, jaywalked, smoked weed where it's illegal, drank underage, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, all these "rules" implemented are incredibly inconsistent around the US and around the world. There are no overarching "rules" on how to handle this virus.</p>

        <p>I am not gonna argue with your first point because you literally just said what the restrictions are for.
The second point I apologise for as clearly I have generalised too much.
Your point about inconsistent rules. Yes they will have different rules because each country has a different experience of covid. A country like Israel can put down much stricter rules than the UK because of its small size and because of the way the country is run. The point of the inconsistent rules is so each country can adapt to their situation, something that is important for a virus which is often unpredictable.</p>

        <p>&rt;you literally just said what the restrictions are for.</p>
<p>My point was that those precautions need to be taken on a personal level driven by personal freedom of choice, not the government deciding to make masks mandatory, restrict businesses and basic movement, and implement lockdowns. Do whatever you need to in order to feel safe, and let others do the same.</p>
<p>&rt;The point of the inconsistent rules is so each country can adapt to their situation, something that is important for a virus which is often unpredictable.</p>
<p>I agree. Which is why very generalized mask mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns aren't going to do much of anything. Each country, state, city, and town needs to handle this differently. What works in Taiwan isn't going to work in India, isn't going to work in Smalltown USA. I think it's silly to act like massive mask mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns will eradicate this virus all over the world.</p>
