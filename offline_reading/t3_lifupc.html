    <strong>Vaccine Bans</strong>
    <p><p>What's our plan here, guys?</p>
<p>They're gonna start pushing harder for this vaccine. We already know this shit isn't going away. Covid is gonna stay around for as long as they want it to. They're gonna start forcing people to take it. Now they can't force people to come get it, so what they'll do is simple. Everyone gets an App that proves they have been vaccinated. They then start placing restrictions on travel, (As has already been advertised.) The restrictions stick around for a bit, then they increase the pressure. Eventually, it'll get to the point where they won't let you go into stores unless you can prove it. Eventually, you'll need to prove you are one of the sheep, and if you aren't, you won't be allowed access to basic neccessities.</p>
<p>I like to chill on r/conspiracy a lot, and we were all talking about this stuff at the beginning of all of this shit. Turns out, most of us aren't crazy nut jobs, we're critical thinkers. But we get lumped in with the flat-earthers and bigfoot hunters, all for questioning the narritive.</p>
<p>The main point being, a lot of us have seen this coming for a while. We're not going back to the way we were. There is no resisting the New Normal. How do we adjust? I ain't taking this vaccine, but without it, I cannot travel, I cannot shop, I cannot live. Stocking provisions will only last for so long, and I am nowhere near at a level I would need to be to start a farm.</p>
<p>When the New Normal rolls in with the Great Reset, (Go ahead and call me a conspiracy nut, then look it up and realize they've already been discussing this at length. "You'll own nothing, and you'll be happy.") we'll own nothing. All vehicles will be replaced with Teslas, made for public transport. You won't be able to travel in a vehicle without proof you are a sheep. Housing was destroyed by the pandemic, and easily bought up. They'll buy up all the housing, and lease it out for free to their sheep. The rest of us will be living on the streets. No one will be paid anymore, everyone will be given what they need. But for those who refuse to be sheep, they will be left with nothing.</p>
<p>How do we protect ourselves from this? How do we prepare ourselves for this?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I subscribe to that pretty heavily.</p>
<p>Combine that with the 'conspiracy theory' that the Elites are Devil Worshippers, and you get a recipe for the end times.</p>

<p>Yeah well ain't going to happen. I won't waste my phone's storage installing crappy software. In fact some sms I got when all that started about tracking and tracing was reported as spam and permanently blocked. And I am not expecting further communication. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; but without it, I cannot travel </p>
<p>Using your own car, are you sure? some of us can run their own businesses that don't have these "restrictions" in place. And of course whoever does it, has a major business advantage serving everyone vs a place with restrictions. I am sure many will be interested.</p>

        <p>We saw how well that went at the capitol.</p>
<p>Protests will do nothing. America is far too divided. So long as the Left and Right are this split, we will never have the strength necessary to over throw the government. If we were to protest peacefully, we would be met with armed forces putting us back in our place. If we were to protest violently, free thought would be hunted by every man, woman, and child in America, as they desperately cling to their illusion of security.</p>
<p>We have no way of rallying others to the cause. Every media site used is controlled by the big corperations, and they can and will censor us. Spreading the word is impossible beyond word of mouth. We would need to go back to penning letters and sending them by mail in order to be completely uncensored.</p>
<p>I am religious. Specifically, Christian. Jesus taught once, "Give to Cesar what is Cesar's, give to God what is God's." Essentially, give to the Government what belongs to them, and give to God what belongs to him. I don't need money or stuff or my own house. (Subreddits like r/simpleliving prove how little you actually need.) What I do need is the essentials. Food and Water and a safe place to read my Bible. Everything else, I could live without. It might not be comfortable, but I could do it.</p>
<p>I believe that all of this is a part of God's plan. The world is winding down, and the so called Elites will continue to sit, fat and happy, on their thrones until Judgement day arrives. There is no point in attempting to stop God's plan. If he wants something to happen, it will happen. There is no doubt. I'll be honest, I don't mind the thought of death. In fact, I'm rather looking forwards to it. However, until that day arrives, I want to do my best to survive. My goal here is not revolution. I've matured enough to recognize that if that is going to happen, it is at least 2-3 generations from now. No, my goal here is survival.</p>

        <p>You are right. We have to just keep believing and trust in God to finish this. But it’s important to speak your mind. </p>

        <p>Seems like that may be a bit out of context, but I see your point.
You can do both at the same time. Speaking your mind is very important. I like to think of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abendigo, the three dudes who were tossed into a furnace for not bowing down to an idol. That’s gonna be my stance on things. If they try to take away what actually matters, I’m standing my ground on pain of death.</p>
