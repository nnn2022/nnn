    <strong>New Normal started way before Covid</strong>
    <p><p>It started going down after 9/11. That’s when control started getting abusive. There are 37 millions of flights per year and we are ALL TREATED LIKE POTENTIAL TERRORISTS because of two f*** planes. I’m sorry for the people who lost their lives but we have to look at things in perspective. If we factor the amount of time lost, the increases costs this results in, we are talking about billions of accumulated hours that we will never get back.</p>
<p>Then Snowden and Assange casually showed that we were ALL SPIED ON and what was the answer? « I don’t see the problem, I have nothing to hide... », « Why are you so concerned about your privacy? What does it matter anyway? »</p>
<p>Now there is Covid. Sit here, not there. Put a mask. Don’t go to the restaurant. Show a negative PCR. Let me swab you anus. Oh you are not happy about that? We are doing this for your own good. Then why do they let millions die from cigarette? Alcohol? Obesity? And care so much about covid. Vaccine passeport is conspiracy, not wanting a vaccine passport is being a conspiracist.</p>
<p>Next step, social credit score and people will welcome it. Oh you don’t like it? What do you mean? You don’t want to be a good dog, sorry a good citizen?</p>
<p>People get what they deserve, the fact that they are permeable to any other narrative is because they WANT to be told how to behave. They enjoy it deep down because that means less responsability overall.</p>
<p>I’m done with my rant, thank you for coming to my TED talk. </p>
<p>Good luck everyone, love this sub. It helps keeping sanity.</p></p>
