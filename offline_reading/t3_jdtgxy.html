    <strong>Looking for ways to break the cognitive dissonance</strong>
    <p><p>Long time lurker, first time poster - this isn't quite a virus centric post, but looking for some like minded folk and this is... really the only place I know of :)</p>
<p>I've been trying to figure out how to break through the cognitive dissonance that seems to be everywhere lately. I live in SoCal, honestly it just feels like everyone here has taken crazy pills. Even before the pandemic, any discussion about the crazier things our governor is doing, or any mentions about the constant 'orange man bad!!!11!!!' rants were met with disgust, if not outright hostility. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's experienced this... everyone around me just dug in their heels, media is right, orange man is bad, the CDC and lord fauci will lead us through if the stupid republicans would just care about humans and wear the damn mask.</p>
<p>I'd been working on trying to figure out a way to get through to them, something that could break the political programming that's honestly terrifying. I wanted to try to get some of my viewpoints across about what’s happening culturally/politically, but make it more…  fun, for lack of a better word.  I’ve been putting together some videos that are essentially video logs from a kinda, well, dumb superhero named Captain Awesomeman.  This hero is returning to earth after 20 years, being confused about what’s going on.   It's unorthodox, and definitely still a WIP - I wanted to strike a balance between a well meaning but naïve viewpoint, someone removed enough from the happenings in the world to hopefully provide perspective different enough to make people think. </p>

<p>Like I said, still very much in the beginning stages, but I'd love some feedback if any of you guys have the time. If this catches anyone's interest, or if you want to collaborate on any projects to help get the word out, either about this or about the virus numbers, hit me up!  I really wanna just get through to people, and I can use all the help I can get :)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p></p>

        <p>I think the biggest thing is to ask questions. It does no one any good to spew facts and links to scientific articles first thing because you need to get the spark in their mind that they might be a different truth. </p>
<p>Ask question like why are licensed doctors being censored by social media platforms? If masks worked why haven't we worn them for hundreds of years? If lockdowns are scientific, why haven't we done this every flue season? At what point is personal safety more important then personal freedom? Who has the right to control medial choice, the individual or the government/cooperate?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These are all questions or similar things that can bring up a desire to look up the truth and regardless of how hard they try to censor people it can still be found out there. I know even recommending the Plandemic 2, or what non government funded news is often a great place to get a different perspective on things. But it is important to make people want to explore the truth for themselves.</p>
