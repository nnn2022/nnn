        <p>First, it was wear the masks and stay home for two weeks and maybe you'll get freedom once the curve was flattened. Then it was we have to wait until a vaccine so we can walk freely. Then it was maybe vaccines and masks. Now the vaccines work as well as they say they do, and they still aren't happy?</p>
<p>It was always trust the science (even though science can't be an ethical system, it changes too much and doesn't even really say something is good or evil, everything is just a reaction to something else that people interpret as good or evil), nothing else matters. Not they want to consider other factors, even though the science says vaccines prevent the need for masks?</p>
<p>People's lives have been altered severely, if not pushed into suicide or death by preventable medical issue since doctors couldn't see them. I think the vaccines are fine and if you sat down and listened to what people have to say, they have a coolheaded explanation for everything, but they kept using a medical license to do whatever they please without properly explaining themselves or at least let the media twist their words for panic.</p>
<p>And now the makers, average citizens who feel like heroes for putting a piece of cloth on their face and brigading r/NoNewNormalButSmart, after preaching blind scientism (not science, Scientism), act like they waltz in and start considering factors besides science? Like we have been considering ethics, they now want to consider risk, an actual uncertainty, as a reason to cause certain trouble for many people?</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
