        <p>Choice bits from the article:</p>
<p>&rt; Klein, the Hopkins epidemiologist, warns the fall wave is likely to be more intense than the peak in the spring. Maryland had 2,000 covid-19 patients in hospitals at its peak in April, he said, and his midrange scenario envisions twice that many hospitalized patients at the next peak.</p>
<p>Now we're back to caring about hospitals being overwhelmed again. "It'll be worse than last time!!!"</p>
<p>&rt; At Hopkins, doctors are discussing what they call “Surge 2.0.” They are envisioning outbreaks that could potentially overwhelm hospitals with covid-19 patients. Even less-catastrophic surges could hamper other kinds of non-covid-19 medical care, said Lisa Lockerd Maragakis, an associate professor of medicine and infectious diseases. </p>
<p>&rt; “Even though we have had so many cases and we have had so many tragic deaths, we have the vast majority of people who are not immune to this virus,” Maragakis said. “Without a therapeutic or a vaccine, we are still in a position where the transmission of the virus depends heavily on our behaviors every day.”</p>
<p>&rt; That is a common refrain among those working around-the-clock to understand this pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt; “We are collectively in control of how many cases or deaths there are,” Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard, said in an email. “Forecasts more than a month from now make sense only if they are conditional on how we behave.”</p>
<p>&rt; “People’s behavior is a dramatic determinant here,” said Christopher Murray, the director of IHME. “Look at what happened in Florida [after the spike in cases]. People got scared. They started wearing masks, they stopped going to bars.”</p>
<p>&rt; But the converse is also true: If people stop being vigilant, the virus bounces back.</p>
<p>They really, really want to sell another lockdown for the fall/winter. People here seem to be in big denial about it, but these sort of articles and news stories continue being pushed along with celebrities testing positive, more use of "New Normal" lingo, etc. Sound familiar? Doesn't it remind you all of March all over again?</p>

        <p>It'll work. Not like much has changed. It is permanent, like you and I think. It is 100% permanent. We are never, ever getting out of this.</p>
<p>Look at all the propaganda and hysteria now surrounding a vaccine. It's NOW not safe. NOW we care about hospitals - though they were never, ever overrun in the first place. All the propaganda about no human interaction in public, it spreads The Virus(tm).</p>
<p>That's how it's gonna be. Human interaction bad. Human living bad.</p>
<p>I love how they just go and bullshit about these stupid models that have no basis in reality. Keeping the country paranoid and hysterical is their modus operandi.</p>

        <p>Florida didn’t stop going to bars. Bars were the only thing Florida shutdown and even then people just went to restaurants with bars, much like Arizona.</p>
<p>Also, the fundamental difference between March and now is that people aren’t scared of it any longer. And you aren’t going to get the sunbelt to comply because we all take all our lives outside in the fall and winter and now we know this shit doesn’t spread outside and we didn’t know that in March. There’s a very big swath of the country they won’t be able to shutdown and people will flock to us from the north when they see that’s the case.</p>

        <p>No shit.  Casedemic.  When you test everybody and their dead grandmother every 10 minutes, using tests that return false positives the majority of the time, of course you're going to have a shit ton of "cases".  Dems need to keep pumping up those case numbers, with a peak in November, then ease off the testing and let the case number fall.  That way if Dementia Joe wins (which <em>isn't</em> a foregone conclusion btw...did they learn nothing in 2016?) they can claim that he fixed Coronavirus.</p>

        <p>I was watching old March 2020 videos of nurses crying and complaining rather than working and one nurse showed people lined up around the hospital in NY, but they weren't really sick, they were just chilling there. They told people to go in to the ER if they had shortness of breath so that they could get positive cases and possibly murder them with a ventilator if they had a free one. </p>
<p>Obviously no one remembers H1N1, I went to the ER during that and people were laying on the front lawn puking and it took 5 hours just to see a triage nurse to give me a pill. It was in the news for about a week.</p>
<p>I have suspicions that the dimmer switch Newsom spoke of for "reopening" is actually the news coverage of our casedemic surges (model predicts 2,000 deaths per day in November in CA). They focus on riots for a week and then back to casedemic the next, but now they have nothing to blame new cases on since it's all Newsom's fault for ignoring farm workers. Oops, oh well, no one cares because they're brown. It's only white, yuppie SF twats who sniff their own farts through their masks and plan to wait it out in their trust-fund cabins in the mountains who have enough money to matter in this state.</p>
