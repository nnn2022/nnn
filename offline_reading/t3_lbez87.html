    <strong>Who else misses the 2010's?</strong>
    <p><p>This is gonna be a fairly long rant, so buckle up. I currently live in the UK and it's fucking terrible here.</p>
<p>I feel like we're heading into an endless repeat of lockdowns and already I'm starting to reminisce back to 2015 and remember how easy life was compared to this. Even early 2019 feels like it was a long time ago, but it wasn't. I never had much going in my life in the first place, but I fucking miss being able to walk around and see everyone happy and not wearing these damn masks. I miss when people could actually have parties and go out and eat pizza without being lambasted for it by virtue signalling assholes. For the record, I don't follow the rules but I hate seeing other people get shamed for living their lives and we have to justify our normal actions if we get caught. They can't stop us but this is the shit we'll have to put up with, for possibly years to come. </p>
<p>Every time we go out now, we have to accept the risk that there could be some snivelling little bitch taking photos of us and posting our pictures online. Imagine coming home one day and seeing your picture on the front page of Reddit or other social media for... being at a restaurant. I don't care about the health of the immune compromised and I'm not ashamed to say it, they should be the ones staying inside instead of expecting everyone to sacrifice their livelihoods to protect them. It's so ridiculous now. Also, and I do apologise if anyone is overweight and reading this, but my country is one of the fattest nations and some of the health problems these people have could have been avoided in the first fucking place. Now, everybody cares about their health all of a sudden when we've been taught for years everywhere and at school how certain habits make us unhealthy and cause premature death. Yet we still did them without question!</p>
<p>I miss life two years ago, even though it feels much longer than that. I'm sure some of you remember a trend when "90's kids" talked about how great life was back in their time, and bashing the newer generations. I guess it's a cycle with every one. But I imagine now that every year before 2020 is something we all wish we could go back to, although late 2019 was when this coronavirus stuff started to arise and get our attention. The whole of last year just felt like the beginning and I think there's a lot more bullshittery to come. </p>
<p>So much has changed in less than a year, and while I'm under the impression that more people are waking up to this farce, it's the children I feel terrible for. I have three nieces and one nephew who are all younger than twelve, and they haven't been able to attend school and at least three of them are raised only seeing people in masks and social distancing. This next generation is going to be fucked and mental health rates are going to go through the roof. Child obesity skyrocketing is a possibly. I fear how long this will go on and if it reaches a breaking point, I'm hoping to make enough money to move to New Zealand or Australia. From what I heard, their restrictions are almost lifted entirely.</p>
<p>I'll give it a year, if we're still in these pointless lockdowns, until everyone starts talking about how they'd give anything to go back to the 2010's. Perhaps start a trend. Already early in this decade and I feel like I would.</p></p>

        <p>I was a kid so I didn't notice. </p>
<p>And apart from 9/11 right at the start of the decade there wasn't any other big terrorist scares to my knowledge whereas ISIS and islamic terrorism was a recurring threat throughout the mid-late 10s. On top of that things such as smartphones, tablets and modern social media ruined the past decade and made everything feel artificial and depressing. Politics got extremely divisive and permeated into everything. People got overly sensitive. Music got worse too.</p>

        <p>I may be a number of years older than you.  I’m 45, and life in my country, America, peaked sometime right before we nearly fucked up the entire financial system, circa 2007-2008.  After that, sometime as the 10’s began, social media and smart phones began to proliferate, and everything went straight to the shitter, or “loo”, as you may know it.</p>
<p>2020 was just another step down.  The US elections meant nothing to me, in November.  I just shudder to think that the next step down will be.</p>

        <p>90s kid here. We have every right to be nostalgic. I was a teenager just as the internet was taking off in a big way, but I still got to enjoy the last generation of a childhood not dominated by portable screens. Even as a teenager me and most of my friends had cell phones but they were just that... Phones. Texting was annoying barely anyone did it.</p>
<p>Fuck the 2010s. Social justice warrior hell as someone else put it. Everything that happened in those years paved the way for society to voluntarily implode itself for a virus with an extremely high survival rate. (Don't want to split hairs but we can all agree it's at least between 98 to 99.9% survivable)</p>
<p>But yes. I too am very nostalgic for the before times.</p>

        <p>&rt;The way we live now doesn't feel real.</p>
<p>That's because it isn't.  Even before COVID, things were becoming increasingly fake, controlled, and superficial.  Not that society was perfect before 9/11 - in fact, some really dark shit was taking place - but normal people still had a space to call their own.  Then 9/11 happened and everything we're living through now - 24 hour news media, waves of hysteria, increasingly elaborate security theater, totalitarian surveillance systems, relentless propaganda, endless war, etc. - started becoming normalized.  It really is a fucked up society.</p>

        <p>90s kid as well. (born in 1983) god I miss laying on my bed talking on my corded phone for hours about boys. Then my friend yelling from outside hey let's go play manhunt. I miss the days of nothing being recorded. We just lived. We didn't stop to take pictures. (only some with a polaroid) I miss how simple things were. Everything after 2010 has been a science experiment gone horribly wrong. I didn't know so many vitriolic people existed until they broadcasted their narcissistic personalities over social media. </p>

        <p>I was born by the end of the 80s and grew up in the 90s. It was heaven to grow up without smartphones. We were much better at being social creatures back then, because we relied on human interaction for our own sanity. Nowadays, everyone is telling you, how easy it is since all of that interaction can be done by that little screen in your pocket. For me, this is not what human interaction is about. Most people I know, always told how difficult it is to maintain long-distance relationships and now everybody is completely fine with being socially isolated? Weird times...</p>

        <p>I feel like it's going to be a long way off, there are so many people who are literally professional SWJs and then you also have people who make a living as anti SWJs. It's a ridiculous cultural situation and I can't believe we allowed this to happen.</p>

        <p>Yupp the UK has got to be one of the most depressing countries at the moment. All the previous lockdowns and the tier system have been for nothing, they aren’t telling us when this current lockdown is ending despite over 10% being vaccinated and cases declining, and on top of that they won’t stop going on about the new variants which basically give them an excuse to continue the lockdowns until they feel like it.</p>

        <p>Yup. I'm supposed to sit exams this year but they won't even let us go back to school. It's gonna mess up any future I had, and why on earth are we doing this when we've vaccinated lots of at risk people? Once the at risk people are vaccinated, there is no kind of excuse for any restrictions to continue (I don't think there ever was), yet they won't even speak of an end point? I used to think this country was alright but I want to leave and never come back.</p>

        <p>I more miss the late 2000's since I was born 2002. Maybe Im just biased cuz I was a kid but looking back everyone was so much happier 2007-2012. The internet was still new and everyone just posted whatever silly youtube video and we all laughed and enjoyed eachother. The music was more upbeat and memorable. Now if you say ONE wrong thing or just a LITERAL JOKE on the internet your a racist homophobic terrorist conspiracy nut crack head. I only recall a handful of songs that came out the past few years and youtube is 99% dead besides a handful of youtubers I still love to watch. And even they all spout "cOvID!11" crap half of the time its not that enjoyable to watch😔</p>

        <p>Society was better pre 2005ish. Tech existed to better your life, not control it. Good cellphones, like the RAZR, existed. People didn't hate each other, politics were something you forgot about instead of ruling your life, kids played outside instead of with an iPad, social media didn't really exist, and society wasn't filled with all this hurt feelings identity politics sjw shit. </p>
<p>Sometime in the early 2000s though, it did become harder to find jobs. Factories started laying off and closing due to laws passed by the Clinton admin, and ever since we've seen a slow bleed of people young and old unable to find work. I remember how hard it was to find factory jobs post high school around 2010ish. Those were abundant for high school grads years earlier.</p>
<p>People who grew up in the 80s/90s seem to be well developed people. They didn't float through life on easy mode like the boomers did so they had to learn to adapt, they learned to embrace technology rather than reject it, and they also had the extensive socialization in their youth that is critical for becoming a healthy adult. Those generations got a healthy balance of what a person needs to be a functional adult I think, and I find that people in their 30s/early 40s are usually the happier well adjusted demographic of people I meet.</p>
<p>1995 is basically the cutoff for living a normal childhood I think. Anyone born after that grew up in a very artificial and unnatural environment, unless they grew up rural.</p>

        <p>&rt;I don't care about the health of the immune compromised and I'm not ashamed to say it, they should be the ones staying inside instead of expecting everyone to sacrifice their livelihoods to protect them. It's so ridiculous now.</p>
<p>^This right here is all I think anymore. I live in Canada and have been in lockdown since Christmas. This disease can be deadly indeed but for the majority it seems like they mostly just get mild symptoms, anyone I've known was still able to work through covid from home, they didn't even take sick leave as they weren't that ill but still had to quarantine obviously to not infect others. I don't understand why we can't just open up with some restrictions and urge those immunocompromised and elderly to stay home until they get a vaccine. I fear for us it'll be months still until the vulnerable get vaccines and if they will work. I just don't know how much more of this dystopian era I can handle myself personally. I just miss the little things that should be normal, going for a walk and ending up at a pub or brewery, walking through a mall, spontaneous hangs with friends, having parties, travelling, etc ...</p>

        <p>In years before 2020, if you complained about the current state of affairs you were told that you were living in the most peaceful time in history. Maybe that was true in that we didn't have constant wars breaking out all over the first world like we did in the past few hundred years. But underneath the surface there was a lot of hostility and divisiveness that was beginning to show. It may not be trench warfare, but it's damn destructive to society.</p>
