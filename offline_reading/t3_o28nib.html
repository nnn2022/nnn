        <p>The claim that COVID-19 killed around 400k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed. </p>
<p>The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does not require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The 400K figure <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">comes from the CDC</a> which states this:</p>
<p>&rt; All Deaths Involving COVID-19 [1]</p>
<p>&rt; [1] Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification</a> also states that confirmation <strong>is not required</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt; What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</p>
<p>&rt; - If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</p>
<p>&rt; - COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or <strong>is assumed to have caused or contributed to death</strong>.</p>
<p>People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, all kinds of diseases, old age, flu, accidents, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moreover, having <strong>a positive PCR test is not indicative of being infected with a virus</strong>:</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__Zx0qS7uI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=%2a%2aBirgit%2a%2a">find almost anything in anybody</a>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Study from november 2020: <a href="http://philosophers-stone.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-scam-has-been-confirmed-Dsalud-November-2020.pdf">PCR does not detect SARS-CoV-2 </a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease"</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Portuguese court has ruled that <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">the PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test</a>, and that "the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is <strong>97%</strong>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Former chief science officer for Pfizer says <a href="https://discover.hubpages.com/politics/Pfizer-Chief-Science-Officer-Second-Wave-Based-on-Fake-Data-of-False-Positives-for-New-Cases-Pandemic-is-Over">"second wave" is faked on false-positive COVID tests</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>TPTB are well aware that the PCR tests are not picking up what they should be picking up, so they need us to use them for testing as long as possible in order for these tests to inflate the numbers world-wide. These numbers are then used to "justify" the imposing of NWO restrictions which are meant to transform society as we know it.</p>

<p>two. unless you've links to show me more than 2.</p>
<p>that's a total for 413 cases, out of 616,920 death in america. take that 413 cases out, will you be able to account for the rest of to 616k ?</p>
<p>you look and verified two links, i don't know them both enough but they seem legitimate. that's less that 0.1% of the death in america. how you making up for the other 99.93% ?</p>
<p>5% with ONLY covid, the rest are for Covid + something else. and from your data, it seems they Covid 19 along with pneumonia, or respiratory failure, or hypertensive among others.</p>

<p>We will continue to find these "mistakes" over the years due to the terrible testing practices. </p>
<p>&rt;two. unless you've links to show me more than 2.</p>
<p>Two that never should have been counted in the first place as the system is broken and includes all deaths with the WuFlu.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/feds-classify-all-coronavirus-patient-deaths-as-covid-19-deaths/">“The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,” she added.</a></p>
<p>This isn't rocket science.</p>
<p>&rt;will you be able to account for the rest of to 616k ?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&rt;how you making up for the other 99.93% ?</p>
<p>Natural causes.</p>
<p><a href="https://notthebee.com/article/a-few-days-ago-johns-hopkins-published-a-study-saying-corona-is-nbd-they-then-deleted-it-read-it-here-in-its-entirety">This trend is completely contrary to the pattern observed in all previous years. Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading. Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19.</a></p>
<p>&rt;5% with ONLY covid, the rest are for Covid + something else. and from your data,</p>
<p>Such as cancer. The average amount of comorbidities is 4. That's asthma, obesity, cancer and diabetes on top of the flu. It's pretty damn clear what the actual cause of death should be.</p>
<p>&rt;it seems they Covid 19 along with pneumonia, or respiratory failure, or hypertensive among others. </p>
<p>If it lists pneumonia, that's pneumonia thought to not be caused by the WuFlu. A comorbidity is an unrelated disease alongside another. A symptom is caused by a disease, and wouldn't count.</p>

        <p>&rt;seriously, why'd you keep calling it wuflu ? is there a precedence ? isn't covid-19 the correct term ?</p>
<p>I have not, nor have I ever used that false term and let China off the hook for what they've done to the global economy.</p>
<p>The push to move away from location based naming for a virus is new this the WuFlu. Every other virus ever was named due to the location it was found. Zika, Ebola, etc. The push for this new naming scheme comes from the WHO, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52088167">who refuses to talk about Taiwan</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not aware, China doesn't recognize Taiwan as a country and considers it part of themselves. Taiwan disagrees and wants to be a free State. As a result China is very sensitive about anyone who supports Taiwan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/actor-john-cena-apologizes-after-taiwan-comment-n1268526">John Cena even had to apologize to the Chinese government for calling Taiwan a country</a>. He did so in order to allow a movie he's in to play in China.</p>
<p>Now if China wasn't genociding people in concentration camps I wouldn't care. However China and the Chinese government have proven to be the worst county, and government in the world due to unethical practices, and freedom destroying laws. </p>
<p>It's also obvious they hyped up the WuFlu globally by releasing videos of people getting welded into their apartment, as well as people dropping dead on the street. </p>
<p>The WHO also reported a claim from the Chinese state ran scientists that the WuFlu can't be transmitted from person to person.</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/who/status/1217043229427761152?lang=en">Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇨🇳.</a></p>
<p>This is why I use the term WuFlu. I do not that the Chinese government deserves to hide the truth on a national scale. I do not think the Chinese government deserves an ounce of respect, or any kind of support, ever, due to what they've done. </p>
<p>I do not have a problem with the Chinese people however. Most of them aren't aware of a better life due to the great firewall, and lack of travel.</p>
<p>&rt;natural causes theory can be easily turned away with excess death</p>
<p>Not at all, as excess death is affected by any kind of death. It's also worth noting that many countries don't have an excess death going into 2021. Violence tied to the riots, increased alcoholism, drug abuse, mental deterioration, suicides, obesity, etc all went up considerably during lockdown and can easily be linked to deaths.</p>

<p>I'd really like to see an article that ties the excess death due to alcoholism, drug abuse etc. as opposed to, you know, covid. which is the point. </p>
<p>the error in death you mentioned earlier accounted for less than .01 total death. you've yet provide the explanation for the other 600k.. </p>
<p>and yes, i can see the disdain you have for Chinese government. it's not like it'll make a difference, covid 19 or wuflu. it being first discovered there doesn't mean that they did it.. besides, didn't they manage it relatively well ? draconian lockdown yes, but it's effective. and yes i know the situation between taiwan and China.</p>

        <p>&rt;also, you do notice that the excess death I've linked happened due to covid right ?</p>
<p>Not at all. </p>
<p>&rt;I'd really like to see an article that ties the excess death due to alcoholism, drug abuse etc. as opposed to, you know, covid. which is the point. </p>
<p>Look at the John Hopkins study that shows most WuFlu deaths are natural deaths rebranded.</p>
<p>&rt;the error in death you mentioned earlier accounted for less than .01 total death. you've yet provide the explanation for the other 600k.. </p>
<p>You've yet to show any proof that they're correlated.</p>
<p>&rt;it's not like it'll make a difference, covid 19 or wuflu.</p>
<p>I don't care. I refuse to let China off the hook.</p>
<p>&rt;it being first discovered there doesn't mean that they did it..</p>
<p>China's only level 4 virus lab, which specialises in coronaviruses and the like, with known gain of function research, which is literally called the "Wuhan Coronavirus Lab" is a few blocks away from the location of the market they called the epicenter of the outbreak.</p>
<p>They then used media of people dropping dead in the street, as well as welding people into their homes to scare the West. </p>
<p>They used the WHO to spread the idea that human to human transmission couldn't happen.</p>
<p>Their deathcount is under 5000. They reported 20 cases this week. In a country of 1 billion. Please tell me how that's possible. Especially if we look at the fact that lockdowns don't work.</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13484">While small benefits cannot be excluded, we do not find significant benefits on case growth of more restrictive NPIs. Similar reductions in case growth may be achievable with less restrictive interventions.</a></p>
<p>This also came after Trump made a trade deal that greatly benefited America over the Chinese. So, the Chinese leaked a virus, and made america lockdown for a year. There's an impending financial crash that's going to make 2008 look like a kiddie ride. </p>
<p>Almost 20% of all American dollars were created last year. Inflation is already at 5%, and I'm willing to bet it's about to jump. Bank stocks showed a concerning dip last week, and we've been seeing reverse repos skyrocket as well. </p>
<p>2020 was the appetizer. The main course is yet to come.</p>

<p><em>Excess mortality is a term used in epidemiology and public health that refers to the number of deaths from all causes during a crisis above and beyond what we would have expected to see under ‘normal’ conditions.1 In this case, we’re interested in how the number of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic compares to the deaths we would have expected had the pandemic not occurred</em> </p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid">https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid</a> - read again then.</p>
<p>&rt;You've yet to show any proof that they're correlated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/how-are-covid-19-deaths-counted-it-s-complicated">- they're marked as covid death.</a> think again before you think they're <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/debunking-the-false-claim-that-covid-death-counts-are-inflated1/">inflated.</a></p>
<p><em>The raw death count helps give us a sense of scale: for example, the US suffered roughly 360,000 more deaths than the five-year average between 26 January and 3 October 2020</em></p>
<p>so where'd you think these came from if not from Covid-19 ?</p>
<p>which John Hopkins "study" ? this ?<br>
<a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/cdc-data-shows-higher-number-of-deaths-in-2020-compared-to-previous-years-johns-hopkins-student-article-compared-percentages-not-raw-numbers/">https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/cdc-data-shows-higher-number-of-deaths-in-2020-compared-to-previous-years-johns-hopkins-student-article-compared-percentages-not-raw-numbers/</a></p>
<p><em>"The claims are inaccurate. Firstly, the basis for this claim is not a scientific study, but an article in the Johns Hopkins News-Letter, a student publication from Johns Hopkins University"</em><br>
<em>Secondly, the article’s report that Briand’s analysis showed no increase in deaths compared to previous years, based on data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is inaccurate.</em> <br>
<em>Indeed, simply comparing the total number of deaths in 2020 so far to that of previous years shows a clear increase in deaths (Figure 1). And a CDC report estimated that between late January and October 2020, there were more than 299,000 excess deaths in the U.S.[1].</em></p>
<p>&rt;Please tell me how that's possible.</p>
<p>they're a self sufficient country, they do not need to open their border to survive. next, their level of lockdown, just see what they did to ensure people stay inside. they believe in the greater good to the community than the individual self. when they say masked up, they literally bash people who don't follow. in USA ? freedom and individual rights take precedence. check New Zealand. it has 5 death per million population, China has 3. USA has 1854. </p>
<p>&rt;Especially if we look at the fact that lockdowns don't work.</p>
<p>false, Lockdown works. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0</a>  - <em>A clear picture emerges where the themes of social distancing and travel restrictions are top ranked in all methods</em></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;This also came after Trump made a trade deal that greatly benefited America over the Chinese. So, the Chinese leaked a virus, and made america lockdown for a year. </p>
<p>China was the worst hit area initially. but they did well in containing the virus, harsh, but well. so did new zealand, USA didn't do as well because of her citizens. lockdown for a year ? wasn't it more like 2.5 months ? earliest date was march 21st latest being june 11th. where'd you get your 1 year from ?</p>

        <p>&rt;above and beyond what we would have expected to see under ‘normal’ conditions.</p>
<p>So funny story, I can't find US deaths by year on Google. And by that I mean a simple chart that goes year by year. First result is the CDC that only has one year of data and it's by causes for some reason. Some graphs with percentage points for... Some reason. </p>
<p>Yet first result for Sweden is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/">exactly what I want</a>. A simple chart. </p>
<p>Canada <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/443061/number-of-deaths-in-canada/">is close</a></p>
<p>U S... <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/195920/number-of-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1990/">only goes up to 2018</a></p>
<p>So tell me, why would it be hidden? Why would they hide data?</p>
<p>The 5th or so result was even a politifact article. I'm coming across propaganda before the actual facts.</p>
<p>I did come across this weird graph which <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate">seems to show the US along the UN deaths prediction</a> however, and I guess it's right where it should be? The graph is weird.</p>
<p>In 2018 there were 2.8 million deaths. The 2020 claim is 3.3 million deaths. Today's claim is 600k dead to the WuFlu, which includes 2021 mind you. </p>
<p>Now the claim is that the WuFlu, which has shown to not be deadly to the young and healthy, to have a 95% survival rate in 70+, for the average death to be in the 80s, for the average death to have 4 comorbidities, to almost exclusively kill people who weren't already going to die is unbelievable. </p>
<p>Let's dissect that 600k.</p>
<p>Of the top we know it's inflated by up to <a href="https://californianewstimes.com/california-county-cuts-covid-toll-by-25-after-finding-some-deaths-clearly-not-caused-by-virus/381617/">25</a>-<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/almost-one-third-covid-deaths-155426293.html?guccounter=1">33</a>% given other locations.</p>
<p>So that 600k drops to around 420k, which funnily enough only affects the WuFlu deaths, not the excess deaths. What would affect the excess deaths is a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/06/953254623/massive-1-year-rise-in-homicide-rates-collided-with-the-pandemic-in-2020">50% jump in murders</a>, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-covid-15-if-only-this-is-how-much-weight-the-average-person-actually-gained-during-the-pandemic-11615574913">60% of Americans gained weight</a>, with 29 pounds being the average. 10% gained 50 pounds.</p>
<p>Obesity is lethal, it complicates everything. 10% of Americans gaining 50 pounds likely caused a high ammount of heart issues and deaths.</p>
<p>Then of course suicides, if we assumed called correlated with actual deeds, we're looking at <a href="http://fox17.com/news/local/feeling-the-pressures-of-the-pandemic-suicide-hotlines-see-800-percent-spike-in-calls">300k from a 800% spike</a></p>
<p>So no, I don't think that assuming the fraudulent WuFlu death count matching a likely fraudulent overall death count is in any way proof of the WuFlu number being accurate. Hell, it's less likely to be real due to the overlap. Again, the primary WuFlu death was a frail elderly person with bad health. Not America, but <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-long-term-care-cases-accounted-for-80-of-canadas-covid-19-deaths/">80%</a> of Canadian deaths were in Long term Care homes where people literally unable to take care of themselves reside. </p>
<p>And you want to claim the Venn diagram of "WuFlu deaths" and "litterally every thing else" only has a 6% overlap?</p>
<p>That's illogical and literally goes against everything known about the virus. This is literally 2+2=5.</p>
<p>So no, I do not see any correlation between excess deaths and WuFlu deaths. </p>
<p>&rt;think again before you think they're inflated.</p>
<p>The California county above with a 25% inflated death count came out after your "debunking" article. Oh, and using such propaganda isn't a valid discussion tactic.</p>
<p>&rt;so where'd you think these came from if not from Covid-19 ?</p>
<p>Suicides, violent crime, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, obesity, domestic abuse, medical mistreatment, etc. </p>
<p>&rt;Indeed, simply comparing the total number of deaths in 2020 so far to that of previous years shows a clear increase in deaths (Figure 1). And a CDC report estimated that between late January and October 2020, there were more than 299,000 excess deaths in the U.S.[1].</p>
<p>"Look at numbers" isn't a valid way to dismiss an article. Try again. </p>
<p>&rt;next, their level of lockdown</p>
<p>Which we know to do nothing. Try again.</p>
<p>&rt;they believe in the greater good to the community than the individual self.</p>
<p>China. <em>China</em>, the place with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-forcefully-harvests-organs-detainees-tribunal-concludes-n1018646">forced prisoner organ harvesting</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_internment_camps#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DAs_of_2019%2C_it_was%2Cinternment_camps_which_are_located?wprov=sfla1">1.5 million Muslims in concentration camps.</a></p>
<p>Your praising a totalitarian shit state which is literally worse than WW2 Germany for their "greater good".</p>
<p>Again, no. This is such an illogical claim it doesn't even have a foundation in the truth. </p>
<p>&rt;when they say masked up, they literally bash people who don't follow.</p>
<p>Which is why the right to self defence, and the right to bear arms is important. You're literally praising violence over an ineffective piece of cloth. </p>
<p>&rt;freedom and individual rights take precedence.</p>
<p>As it should be. </p>
<p>&rt;false, Lockdown works.</p>
<p>They do not.</p>
<p>In your second article it talks about France. The funny is is for a good long while Sweden had fewer deaths than France. They still do as well. Actually top of my head, 15k vs 100k, with 10 million vs 67 million population... France did worse.</p>
<p>New Zealand, Australia, etc are large island counties with strict borders and no real way in/out without anyone knowing. So the fact they're a totalitarian shithole, while a shame for their people, is irrelevant here when talking about a far larger, harder to control country like America.</p>
<p>&rt;China was the worst hit area initially.</p>
<p>3000 dead. Flat bar for a graph after that. Try again. </p>
<p>&rt;lockdown for a year ? wasn't it more like 2.5 months ? earliest date was march 21st latest being june 11th. where'd you get your 1 year from ? </p>
<p>I'm including all restrictions, especially as people in Ontario can't legally buy items from specific items in a store.</p>
<p>Even today.</p>
<p>Because not a single WuFlu law makes sense.</p>

        <p>&rt;Some graphs with percentage points for... Some reason.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate">https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate</a> death per 1000. you just have to multiply it by US population. </p>
<p><a href="https://knoema.com/atlas/United-States-of-America/topics/Demographics/Mortality/Crude-death-rate">https://knoema.com/atlas/United-States-of-America/topics/Demographics/Mortality/Crude-death-rate</a> - here're 2 links for you.</p>
<p>&rt;Now the claim is that the WuFlu, which has shown to not be deadly to the young and healthy, to have a 95% survival rate in 70+</p>
<p>yup, claim is still true, there's a large there're 34 million cases of covid infection so far. 617k deaths. number is about right</p>
<p>&rt;Let's dissect that 600k.</p>
<p>Of the top we know it's inflated by up to 25-33% given other locations.</p>
<p>So that 600k drops to around 420k</p>
<p>that's not how it works. you've given TWO links, isolated incidents that amounted to 411 + 3877 added in error. NOT across the nation. you don't see me doing math in this manner "Texas recorded 3.6k firearm death in 2019, therefore US firearm death for 2019 is 3.6k x 50 states"  </p>
<p>&rt;Again, the primary WuFlu death was a frail elderly person with bad health. Obesity is lethal, it complicates everything. 10% of Americans gaining 50 pounds likely caused a high ammount of heart issues and deaths.</p>
<p>true, also true that they'd be alive for a bit more if not for covid.</p>
<p>&rt;So no, I do not see any correlation between excess deaths and WuFlu deaths.</p>
<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid">https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid</a> - so how'd you explain the sudden spike ?</p>
<p>&rt;The California county above with a 25% inflated death count came out after your "debunking" article. Oh, and using such propaganda isn't a valid discussion tactic.</p>
<p>which one is propaganda ? lol, mine is a scientific response to how covid deaths are recorded. not from CNN or Fox</p>
<p>&rt;Suicides, violent crime, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, obesity, domestic abuse, medical mistreatment, etc.</p>
<p>got a source ? better be a good one to explain a 600k increment, or even a 300k one</p>
<p>&rt;The 2020 claim is 3.3 million deaths. Today's claim is 600k dead to the WuFlu, which includes 2021 mind you.</p>
<p>isn't that about right ? there's 600k is spread over 2020 to 2021. it's technically death over 2 years.</p>
<p>&rt;"Look at numbers" isn't a valid way to dismiss an article. Try again.</p>
<p>The link you provided earlier on is NOT a scientific study, but instead an article published in a student newsletter at Johns Hopkins University. Secondly, the claim that no excess deaths have occurred in 2020 is false. Data from the U.S. CDC clearly shows that the number of deaths in 2020 is higher than that of previous years</p>
<p>The article’s report that Briand’s analysis showed no increase in deaths compared to previous years, based on data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is inaccurate. Briand had attempted to examine whether the pandemic had led to an increased amount of deaths by comparing changes in the proportion of deaths among different age groups from early February to early September 2020. However, this method obscured the increases in the raw number of deaths, because more deaths can occur without any marked changes in the proportion of deaths among different age groups</p>
<p>Two points to dismiss your article instead of just look at the numbers. which is point 3. read the entire article.</p>
<p>&rt;Your praising a totalitarian shit state which is literally worse than WW2 Germany for their "greater good".</p>
<p>no, i merely commended on their effectiveness in curbing covid. draconic BUT effective. i've no idea how you link organ harvesting and xinjiang inside, focus man.</p>
<p>&rt;In your second article it talks about France. The funny is is for a good long while Sweden had fewer deaths than France. They still do as well. Actually top of my head, 15k vs 100k, with 10 million vs 67 million population... France did worse.</p>
<p>you cannot simply compare between cross country. look at each individually and how the cases drop between lockdowns and no lockdowns. france is 4x as dense as sweden btw. and france had fewer cases per million pop compared to sweden. their death came because they were one of the earlier hit country and it hit them hard. they introduced lockdown after that, see how their cases drop after lockdown.</p>
<p>if you want compare country, i can simply put up USA and China, both with large population and simply say USA did worse. it doesn't make sense. we're looking at the effectiveness of lockdown, no how one country is faring over the other. </p>
<p>&rt;New Zealand, Australia, etc are large island counties with strict borders and no real way in/out without anyone knowing</p>
<p>you missed the fact that they abide by the lockdown rules.</p>
<p>&rt;They do not.</p>
<p>that's 3 words, you don't just dismiss 3 sets of study with 3 words and false equivalency. try again, much harder this time. look at all 3 studies, not just france and sweden. look at the comparison, cases drop after lockdown. lockdown works ONLY if the people follow the rules.</p>
<p>this wouldn't be here if lockdowns don't work</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7268966/ - Our results show that lockdown is effective in reducing the number of new cases in the countries that implement it, compared with those countries that do not. This is especially true around 10 days after the implementation of the policy. Its efficacy continues to grow up to 20 days after implementation.</p>

<p>There's no evidence to suggest either the cases or the death count is even in the ballpark of what it actually is. The data has been drug through the dirt and muddled at every possible opportunity.</p>
<p>&rt;that's not how it works. you've given TWO links, isolated incidents that amounted to 411 + 3877 added in error.</p>
<p>No, I've given two links where errors were found. If you see one ant crawling on your floor, do you assume it's the only ant in your home? Of course not, that's idiotic. We have evidence that a large amount of deaths classified as WuFlu deaths by the CDC and other organizations were in fact <em>not</em> WuFlu deaths. The fact that this is likely a far greater issue is a guarantee.</p>
<p>&rt;NOT across the nation. you don't see me doing math in this manner "Texas recorded 3.6k firearm death in 2019, therefore US firearm death for 2019 is 3.6k x 50 states" </p>
<p>No, because you're using data wrong.</p>
<p>I'm using percentages, not pure numbers. One can scale, the other can't. </p>
<p>If you read a report saying "10% of all minor drug possession charges in Texas were from planted evidence from cops", would you not be suspicious of every cop in every state? </p>
<p>This isn't "number go brrrrr", this is showcasing a systematic issue which very easily, more likely than not, be widespread. </p>
<p>&rt;true, also true that they'd be alive for a bit more if not for covid.</p>
<p>[Citation Needed]</p>
<p>&rt; source ? better be a good one to explain a 600k increment, or even a 300k one</p>
<p>I could likely go through all the data and get 300k in extra deaths. But I'm not going to. I don't give a shit about changing your mind, and you know you're not going to change my mind. I never use Reddit on a computer, and only on my phone. So fuck that.</p>
<p>&rt;Data from the U.S. CDC </p>
<p>Ok, and? The CDC is a crock of shit. What proof do they have of these deaths? We know they've purposely made <em>any</em> death up to a month <em>after</em> a positive WuFlu test, which uses to many cycles and gets <em>many</em> false positives. The CDC has 0 credibility to me. I don't give a shit what they say.</p>
<p>&rt;clearly shows that the number of deaths in 2020 is higher than that of previous years</p>
<p>And? As I've said above that can easily be explained by the lockdowns and society within that timeframe. Hell, missed doctor appointments as well as bad diagnosis from being forced to zoom a doctor would likely kill at least 100k last year. Who knows what will happen this year as people didn't get tested for cancer? Even a month wait for a cancer treatment can be deadly. And fun fact, the most survivable form of cancer is less lethal than a 70+ year old. Getting the WuFlu. </p>
<p>&rt;The article’s report that Briand’s analysis showed no increase in deaths compared to previous years</p>
<p>Because at the time there wasn't an increase. Much like how Sweden had a lower than average death rate until February or December, and to my knowledge is still lesser than they should be given the population increase over the decade.</p>
<p>I'm not using the article to say not a single person died from the WuFlu. I'm saying there's data manipulation at play and that the WuFlu death rate is likely highly inflated. We can see that due to the drop in other causes of death. Again this is a virus that attacks the old and frail above all else. unlike polio, Ebola, Zika. Spanish flu, the plauge, etc. Since we also see a decrease in other causes of death, we shouldn't see a huge number of excess deaths caused by the WuFlu. Yet here we are.</p>
<p>&rt;Two points to dismiss your article instead of just look at the numbers. which is point 3. read the entire article.</p>
<p>I disagree, and I have read the article.</p>
<p>&rt;you cannot simply compare between cross country.</p>
<p>Cool, we agree. So let's stop comparing countries to places like Australia China and New Zealand.</p>
<p>&rt;france is 4x as dense as sweden btw.</p>
<p>Fun fact.</p>
<p>Study: Urban Density Not Linked to Higher Coronavirus Infection Rates—and Is Linked to Lower COVID-19 Death Rates</p>
<p>https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/urban-density-not-linked-to-higher-coronavirus-infection-rates-and-is-linked-to-lower-covid-19-death-rates.html</p>
<p>&rt;we're looking at the effectiveness of lockdown, no how one country is faring over the other. </p>
<p>No, you can make neither comparison as different countries have different cultures and some, unlike China Australia and New Zealand, have human rights. </p>
<p>&rt;you missed the fact that they abide by the lockdown rules</p>
<p>Lockdowns don't work, violate human rights, and if they did work wouldn't have to be in place for longer than 2 weeks.. The fact France and others made it against the law to walk to far away from your home for months, shows they don't work. </p>
<p>&rt;you don't just dismiss 3 sets of study with 3 words</p>
<p>I just did.</p>
<p>&rt;look at the comparison, cases drop after lockdown.</p>
<p>What happened to not comparing different countries? </p>
<p>&rt; lockdown works ONLY if the people follow the rules.</p>
<p>I disagree. Lockdowns don't work. I don't think case numbers matter, the numbers are faked. </p>
<p>I don't think the death count matters, it's inflated and I don't <em>care</em>. Life has a basic risk of death as it is. This virus hasn't shown to warrant a single precaution.</p>
<p>If I placed a bomb under my car and blew it up, it could in theory get it into the parking lot a block over. Does that "work" as a means of transportation? I wouldn't say so. Much like lockdowns, its willfully ignorant of the end result. </p>
<p>&rt;this wouldn't be here if lockdowns don't work</p>
<p>They don't work.</p>
<p>That link is a "cross country" comparison. I thought we decided not to compare different countries?</p>
<p>&rt;Our results show that lockdown is effective in reducing the number of new cases in the countries that implement it, compared with those countries that do not. This is especially true around 10 days after the implementation of the policy. Its efficacy continues to grow up to 20 days after implementation. </p>
<p>I do not see this as a benefit even if it was true. We could cure aids <em>today</em> by murdering every person who has HIV/AIDS. After that, it's gone. Is that a solution? No? So why do you think that causing an unprecedented ammount of poverty, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic abuse, etc is warranted for a virus such as the WuFlu? </p>
<p>Let me make this clear, I do not care if the WuFlu had an 80% death rate. I do not care if the virus was actually contagious. I do not care if lockdowns were proven to work. I would not abide by laws that restrict basic human rights. </p>
<p>That said, in such a situation people wouldn't need laws to stay inside, as it's an actual pandemic and not this media fear mongering bullshit.</p>

<p>haven't we went on at length about the strict procedures of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767262">certifying covid deaths ?</a> fact is you don't have a credible source that can support that there's inaccuracy at a large scale, or that those numbers wasn't accurate. remember, if there's a claim, state your source, otherwise it'll just be dismissed. meaning, 600k death is still true unless proven otherwise.</p>
<p>&rt;No, I've given two links where errors were found. If you see one ant crawling on your floor, do you assume it's the only ant in your home? Of course not, that's idiotic. </p>
<p>you NEED to understand how false equivalency works. we can't compare ants crawling. that's false equivalency. just because brazil allows gun ownership, and US allow gun ownership, you'd just assume that they have the same gun related incidents. if you really want a near enough comparison, if there's a cancel mole on your body, you don't assume your whole body is full of it. you NEED to show me prove that it's like that all around, the 4000 or so cases doesn't automatically denounce the 600k death. show me proof. don't assume. if you can make such claim without evidence, i can reject your claim without evidence as well.</p>
<p>&rt;If you read a report saying "10% of all minor drug possession charges in Texas were from planted evidence from cops", would you not be suspicious of every cop in every state?</p>
<p>no i wouldn't. innocent until proven guilty. </p>
<p>&rt;The CDC has 0 credibility to me.</p>
<p>the world doesn't revolve around what you think. i'm not here to convince you either. policies were made based on CDC's advice and research.</p>
<p>&rt;What proof do they have of these deaths?</p>
<p>what proof do you have that it isn't ? proof, not assumption. you don't win court cases based on assumption. just look at Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and Mike Lindell, they are facing lawsuits for assumption without evidence.  </p>
<p>&rt;Hell, missed doctor appointments as well as bad diagnosis from being forced to zoom a doctor would likely kill at least 100k last year.</p>
<p>source ? cause i can say "i'm sure bad diagnosis and zooming doctors will kill 2 pax at most last year". we can't just pull figures out of thin air. if i'm a doctor and if it's serious, i'd make a house visit or get patient to come in. it's dumb to think i can treat patient with serious illness over zoom. you don't just make such assumption.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm saying there's data manipulation at play and that the WuFlu death rate is likely highly inflated.</p>
<p>again, source ?</p>
<p>&rt; We can see that due to the drop in other causes of death</p>

<p>wrong, they do. just look at USA's graph. i've shown you at least 3 other studies to show you how lockdowns lowered cases and somehow that still escapes you.</p>
<p>&rt;I don't think case numbers matter, the numbers are faked.</p>
<p>that's what you think. but you've nothing to support your argument. if this is a court, your case will get thrown out of it simply because you're assuming. things in real world don't run on assumption. why'd you think they get sued if assumption works ?</p>
<p>&rt;That link is a "cross country" comparison. I thought we decided not to compare different countries?</p>
<p>cool, just look at USA then <a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02501-x/figures/1">https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02501-x/figures/1</a> </p>
<p>&rt;I do not see this as a benefit even if it was true.</p>
<p>because you're not a policy maker. you care only for yourself, not your society. </p>
<p>&rt;That said, in such a situation people wouldn't need laws to stay inside</p>
<p>why'd laws against murder exist ? why do laws against driving under influence exist ? is it not my god given right to drink as and when i want ? it's basic freedom, to drink !! why can't i drink and drive ? LOL in fact i pay for roadtax !! why can't i drive on both lanes !?!?   </p>
<p>because that's NOT how you interpret infringement of basic human rights. people have the right to live. and your callous attitude towards the pandemic is endangering their right. your refusal to cooperate endangers them. like i said, it's a good thing you're not the majority, lots of people follow the instructions of the leaders they elect. it's a democratic society. what YOU think doesn't count, it's what the majority thinks. a large part of them follows the lockdown, follow mask mandate. took up vaccination. to save live. you'd never move forward as a society if you care only about "your human rights". no i'm not a communists. don't put words into my mouth again. i'm just thinking, if USA lost the civil war because a soldier wanted his right, and isn't interested in laying down his life to create what USA is now, how will things be like ?</p>

<p>&rt;haven't we went on at length about the strict procedures of certifying covid deaths ? </p>
<p>They're not strict at all, I've I've talked about multiple times. Let's not forget that we're seeing counties remove deaths.</p>
<p><a href="https://oaklandside.org/2021/06/04/alameda-countys-new-covid-death-toll-is-25-lower-than-thought/">Alameda County’s new COVID death toll is 25% lower than thought</a></p>
<p>Due to how terrible the count was.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that 600k Americans died due to the WuFlu.</p>
<p>&rt;you NEED to understand how false equivalency works.</p>
<p>I know what false equivalency is. </p>
<p>How can 25% of a county be wrong while using the same methods the rest of the country using, and yet it's a "one time thing". </p>
<p>You're free not to believe me. I don't care. </p>
<p>&rt;policies were made based on CDC's advice and research.</p>
<p>Which was shown to be wrong. Back in March 2020 the reports were saying a 3% fatality rate and that lockdowns were needed. Very shortly after we saw that the reports they used weren't accurate in the least. Yet the policies stayed.</p>
<p>&rt;what proof do you have that it isn't ?</p>
<p>The fact this isn't a deadly virus. The survival rate is incredibly high, and the PCR test used is highly suspect.</p>
<p>&rt;Proof, not assumption. you don't win court cases based on assumption. just look at Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and Mike Lindell, they are facing lawsuits for assumption without evidence. </p>
<p>You do understand that most of those court cases didn't get in front of a judge right?</p>

<p>It's in a 100 or so page PDF and talks about cancer cases in Canada alone. But feel free to take a look.</p>
<p>&rt;again, source ?</p>
<p>They admitted it from the beginning.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/feds-classify-all-coronavirus-patient-deaths-as-covid-19-deaths/">“The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,” she added.</a></p>
<p>95% of deaths have 4 other things on the death certificate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death.</a></p>
<p>But hey let's assume someone with cancer, aids, diabetes, and leukemia who happened to get a cough died due to that cough, and not the fact his body decided to kill him.</p>
<p>&rt;well, cause covid killed them</p>
<p>No, if there was a pandemic people would still die from the flu, from heart disease, etc. We wouldn't see a large reduction in every single other cause of death. </p>
<p>&rt;wrong, they do. just look at USA's graph.</p>
<p>They do not work. Look at the graphs of Texas and California for the last 6 months. There is no graph that shows any benefit from lockdowns.</p>
<p>&rt;but you've nothing to support your argument.</p>
<p>The PCR test is so unreliable that even the new York Times talked about it.</p>

<p>&rt;if this is a court</p>
<p>This is Reddit </p>
<p>&rt;your case will get thrown out of it simply because you're assuming</p>
<p>If this was a court I'd actually sit down and get my sources ready. Instead I'm on my phone typing to you because I don't give a damn. I haven't seen any evidence that the WuFlu is contagious. That it's deadly, that masks work, that lockdowns work, that a single restriction has been based on any kind of data.</p>
<p>&rt;cool, just look at USA then</p>
<p>That graph is literally idiotic. It's Case Fatality rate, vs the date. That doesn't at all talk about lockdowns. Try again.</p>
<p>&rt;you care only for yourself, not your society. </p>
<p>I care for individuals in society. </p>
<p>&rt;people have the right to live. and your callous attitude towards the pandemic is endangering their right.</p>
<p>Thing is a 99.99%+ survivable virus that you're not even guaranteed to get doesn't compare to an attempted murder which we'll say it's at least 20% likely to result in a death, likely 80-90% in psychological damage and injuries.</p>
<p>By your own logic all people with STDs should have a vow of celibacy, after all if the condom rips and you infect the other person, that's attempted murder! Even though it's a misdemeanor in California to knowingly give someone aids.</p>

<p>Your life isn't in danger, if you're under 50 you're more likely to die in an auto accident than from the WuFlu. </p>
<p>&rt;it's what the majority thinks.</p>
<p>Yes, Mob rule has never before turned into a bad situation.</p>
<p>The average person doesn't care enough either way. They just follow the rules, they don't care about enforcing them, or breaking them. It's the idiotis in the media that set the agenda and push for it. </p>

<p>yes, you've talked about it a lot of times, but there's only TWO county that got it wrong. not all, so instead of 624715, you have now 624302. there's absolutely no evidence that Covid killed less than 600k, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/debunking-the-false-claim-that-covid-death-counts-are-inflated1/">look at this link</a></p>

<p>if anything, covid death have been undercounted. </p>
<p><em>“All serious analyses of these data are showing that the number of deaths we're hearing on the news is an undercount,” - Steven Woolf, a physician and population health researcher at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine.

<p>&rt;You're free not to believe me.</p>
<p>i have the exact fact and science pasted for you, it's staring you in your face.</p>
<p>&rt;Which was shown to be wrong. Back in March 2020 the reports were saying a 3% fatality rate and that lockdowns were needed.</p>
<p>Lombardy has its mortality up to 18% at a point in time, Italy has its up to 10%. USA had 3% at a time and only because of the policy that kept the number down. you could attribute it to the safety measures set in place that kept it low.</p>
<p>just look at florida now, no lockdown ? covid cases went all the way up.</p>
<p>&rt;The fact this isn't a deadly virus. The survival rate is incredibly high, and the PCR test used is highly suspect.</p>
<p>tell that to india and indonesia.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker">https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker</a> </p>
<p>look at the excess death caused by covid.</p>
<p>it was a constant + &rt;40% for months on end, why only in 2020/ 2021 when covid is around ? again, USA is not the only country.</p>
<p>&rt;They do not work. Look at the graphs of Texas and California for the last 6 months. There is no graph that shows any benefit from lockdowns.</p>

<p>again, look at this lockdown works<br>
<em>We noted that, while social distancing interventions were in place, most new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were averted, even with modest reductions in contact among adults. However, when interventions ended, the epidemic rebounded.</em>  </p>
<p>&rt;I haven't seen any evidence that the WuFlu is contagious</p>

        <p>you should've seen this interview between a journalist and WHO rep earlier on when they call for the organisation to recognise taiwan as a country and share information regarding covid prevention (they wanted access to WHO as they're receiving info from china only). the rep tried hilariously to pretend there's connection issue and then just ending the zoom meeting. thanks for the tidbit btw, but it has little to do with our debate</p>

        <p>So what’s point of the hoax? Like what’s the big plan? Say that people died to what end?</p>
<p>What ever your prediction is, I’ll wait until this is all over and check back on this. This subreddit is trying to claim there is an overarching scheme to idk get people to comply? I honestly don’t get it… I’ll still go to work and go about my life. Wearing a mask doesn’t really impact my life, it’s more like wearing a seatbelt… idk not too big of an issue.</p>
<p>Asking people to take a vaccine… well they have been doing that with a bunch of other diseases… so… if it’s part of a big scheme, I’m very curious of what the end game would be.</p>
<p>I’m honestly just trying to understand the perspective because I really don’t see the end game to the conspiracies</p>

<h2>Covid-1984: Requiem for a Scam</h2>
<p>Here’s how this multilayered racket works.</p>
<h1>1. Create Faulty “Covid” PCR Test</h1>
<p>&rt;”without having virus material available” ^1  </p>
<p>&rt;“relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet” ^2</p>
<h1>2. Asymptomatic, Anyone?</h1>
<p>Only use 2 out of 3 test primers and greater than 35 cycles:</p>
<p>&rt;“...the <strong>probability</strong> that said result is a <strong>false positive is 97%”</strong> ^1, ^2, ^6, ^7, ^8, ^9, ^10, ^11, ^12, ^13, ^14, ^31, ^32, ^39, ^40, ^44, ^45</p>
<p>&rt;”It is <strong>spreading like fire</strong>,” Abbi told NBC News by phone... none of them had really serious symptoms. In fact, <strong>they all seem to be asymptomatic.”</strong> ^27</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>BBC: “Majority testing positive have no symptoms”</strong> ^28, ^29, ^30, ^31</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”NFL has 77 apparently false positive</strong> coronavirus tests from New Jersey lab” ^41</p>
<h1>3. Cash for COVID Diagnosis</h1>
<p>&rt;”They get <strong>more money</strong> if those <strong>patients</strong> are then <strong>put on ventilators.”</strong> ^3, ^4, ^5</p>
<p>&rt;”Once again the old adage — <strong>follow the money</strong> — and we saw that <strong>if hospitals could somehow hit 161 admissions with COVID-19, that they would be eligible for a $77,000 per admission</strong> payment through the CARES Act.” ^49</p>
<p>&rt;He added, “I don’t think there’s any questions that <strong>perverse incentives have been created.”</strong>
&rt;-Sen. Scott Jensen</p>
<h1>4. Use antibody and antigen tests prone to “cross-reactivity” with other coronaviruses...</h1>
<p>Creating false positives and negatives. ^15, ^16, ^17,  ^18, ^47</p>
<p>&rt;”...<strong>all 10 of the individuals who tested positive with the antigen tests on Saturday tested negative today.”</strong> ^46</p>
<h1>5. Cook the Books</h1>
<p>&rt;”...<strong>classifying all deaths of patients with coronavirus as 'COVID-19' deaths, regardless of cause.”</strong> ^19, ^20, ^21, ^36, ^37, ^38</p>
<p><strong>Count Death by:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Motorcycle accident ^22</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car accident ^23</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ladder falls ^24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suicides and murders ^25</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gunshots?</h2>
<p>&rt;”These two people had tested positive for COVID, but that’s not what killed them. <strong>The gunshot wound killed them and it’s very misleading for you to put numbers out there saying these people died from COVID</strong> when that’s not what they died from,” said Coroner Brenda Bock.” ^43</p>
<p>&rt;”Tennessee <strong>woman who died in February gets letter saying she’s positive for COVID-19”</strong> ^26</p>
<h2>If caught cooking the books, remove those items and say it was a goof.</h2>
<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve Briand states:</strong></p>
<p>“If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But <strong>a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn’t give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,” Briand replied.”</strong> ^33 ^34 ^35</p>
<p><em>Note: Johns Hopkins pulled Dr. Genevieve Briand’s study.  Cat’s out of the bag though.</em></p>

        <p>Copypasta is fun, but did Pfizer’s stock go up? Idk about you, but I am baffled as to why their stock didn’t go up. Musk and bezos made a bunch of money because their net worth is balls deep in AMZN and TSLA… so if that’s your understanding then you too should be balls deep in AMZN and TSLA.</p>
<p>I don’t get why people are upset about a guy putting all his money in a company and that companies stock going up. You have that same opportunity. Literally right now, put your money in MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, and TSLA. It would be a win win. If the stock goes down then you can sit fine since the people you hate are losing money. If it goes up, you make money</p>

<p>Tell me, when you're legally not allowed to have a small mom and pop shop, when local stores are essentially closed to the point where many went out of business, and the entire public was told if they went to Walmart they might die.... Can you see why Amazon would go up in value?</p>
<p>This was a transfer of wealth forced by illogical laws and policies with little to no basis in reality. </p>
<p>Up to 500 million people, 1/14th the global population, may have slipped into poverty due to 2020. During a time many people were <em>legally barred from working</em>.</p>
<p>Dude stocks are lame, only open for 8 hours on week days? Fuck that crypto is where it's at. </p>
<p>The issue however isn't people making money. It's they made money due to the laws forcing people to use their business. It's due to the fact a mattress store was non essential, yet you can buy a mattress at Walmart anyhow. It's due to the fact not a single prevention was needed for the WuFlu.</p>

        <p>But if you predict this conspiracy then… shouldn’t you have invested in AMZN? Or shouldn’t you continue to invest in AMZN?</p>
<p>Sure crypto is a good bet.</p>
<p>With any of these prediction this sub makes, my advice is to bet on these predictions. If you know something for sure, then it’s easy to make a shit lot of money off of it.</p>
<p>You think Bill Gates is behind everything? Then put your money where he puts his money, it’s fairly public info. You think that the government is favoring big tech, then put your money in big tech. </p>
<p>What I’ve seen with these conspiracies is that when I point out how you can make money off of predictions that you “know” are true, suddenly I get responses like “I’m not a gambler” or some crap like that</p>

        <p>I have never claimed to predict a conspiracy. The fuck you on about?</p>
<p>Stocks are bullshit as I've said. And then at the end of the year you're sitting there with a 4% gain, half goes to taxes, 1% goes to fees aaaaamnnnddd you lost money due to 5% inflation as the fed prints money to cover the cost of <em>crippling the entire economy over a fucking cough</em>.</p>

        <p>Okay well now I am super convinced you don’t know about investing. The S&amp;P500 has gone up 16% y/y for the last 5 years… so where is the 4% you are getting? How does half go to taxes? Do you know about long term capital gains? The fees I pay for investing in the S&amp;p500 is literally 0.07%… not 7% … not even 1%! 0.07% hahah.</p>
<p>Inflation really hurts cash, but the stock market tends to correct for that. So if you “predict” high inflation, you can again make money off that.</p>
<p>You aren’t directly making predictions, but you are implicitly.</p>

        <p>Different countries differant rules bud. Canada is a shithole that can die in a fire. There's a 1% fee simply to transfer CAD to USD. </p>
<p>16% turns into 8% after taxes. Remove 5% for inflation, and 1% for fees, and if you get.... 2% profits.</p>
<p>Meantime I'm up 54 000% on dogecoin, which unlike the stock market, can be traded at any point in time, on any day, used to buy stuff, and best of all, there's no idiotic 3 day waiting period that prevents me from exchanging money. Transactions take an hour at most and with as little at 0% fees. </p>
<p>Oh, and fuck anything that has to do with shorting a stock. That practice should be illegal as it has no useful value to the market. Betting someone will fall is a net loss to society.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you really don’t know how this stuff works. I’m well aware of foreign transaction fees. You can get around it once you are exchanging more than about $10k. </p>
<p>Keep going for Dogecoin. That crap is awesome! Tbh I’m too timid to get into Crypto currencies. If I was to, I’d probably be leaning on doge.</p>

        <p>The capital gains tax is still a hard 50%. There's no way around that. </p>

        <p>The plan was to win the 2020 presidential election, destabilize America (the last real opponent of communist powers worldwide), and fuel the rise of China.  The only way you could deny this is if you ignored the fact that China’s economy is the only one that benefited from the pandemic, and if you ignored all of the footage of the utter ineptitude of our so-called “president.”</p>

        <p>So our stock market will be going down? Or is it going down? Destabilizing our country would surely mean that the S&amp;P500 would be in the shitter right?</p>

        <p>The economy isn't the Stock market, the Stock market just shows, how much money faith people have into a Company. And if you throw out a bunch of stimulus, the faith neccesairy to buy decreases, this,if it doesn't happen naturaly, decreases the link between how the economy is going and the real economy.</p>

        <p>Agreed that the stock market isn’t the economy, but it is a pretty good metric for the economy.</p>
<p>I think if a country is unstable then the stock market would also be unstable… if you pay too much attention to Fox News and cnn, you will always be convinced that the US is unstable.</p>

        <p>Bro, it's a global conspiracy to enact a one world government  even though some of the global super powers have entirely different styles of governing.  Don't you see?  China was totes in on it.  The western powers are totally trying to meld with totalitarian regimes to oust Republicans and create a cashless society under the new world order.  Why?  Because fuck logic.</p>

        <p>What? Looking at countries like Russia, Israel, and Brazil it doesn’t seem like they want Republicans out. Also China seems like the type of country that would love republicans.</p>
<p>I agree that there is a movement towards all countries being United, but there are too many egos involved to get something like that.</p>
<p>So China wants a one government system? I don’t see that playing very nice with the western world…</p>

Its arrogant to think humans could control a viral contagion. And it it pretty fucking silly to blame me for killing 3 million people.

        <p>The claim that COVID-19 killed around 600k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed. </p>
<p>The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does not require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The 600K figure <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">comes from the CDC</a> which states this:</p>
<p>&rt; All Deaths Involving COVID-19 [1]</p>
<p>&rt; [1] Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification</a> also states that confirmation <strong>is not required</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt; What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</p>
<p>&rt; - If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</p>
<p>&rt; - COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or <strong>is assumed to have caused or contributed to death</strong>.</p>
<p>People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, all kinds of diseases, old age, flu, accidents, etc.</p>

<p>Moreover, having <strong>a positive PCR test is not indicative of being infected with a virus</strong>:</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__Zx0qS7uI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=%2a%2aBirgit%2a%2a">find almost anything in anybody</a>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>

<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease"</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>

<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>

<p>TPTB are well aware that the PCR tests are not picking up what they should be picking up, so they need us to use them for testing as long as possible in order for these tests to inflate the numbers world-wide. These numbers are then used to "justify" the imposing of NWO restrictions which are meant to transform society as we know it.</p>

<p>You know who that was, right? There's a really good reason no rational person is listening to that guy. He is perhaps the person most to blame for the stigma of HIV/AIDS we had to fight for decades, and policies based on his personal views (not studies) is attributed to 330,000 avoidable deaths in South-Africa. He pushed the narrative that there was no link between the HIV virus and AIDS, that the life-style of the people developing AIDS was to blame; the decadence of gay people and drug users.</p>
<p>He died last august. While he made significant contributions to science in his time, the damage done by abusing his credentials to serve his own political agenda is immeasurable.</p>

<p>This topic has been widely discussed and reported on for a year now. That article even contains tons of references to other articles and studies published in prominent places. If you read it (which I'm <em>sure</em> you did), you will see that this is a discussion about what threshold level would be optimal for the tests. It's a gradient, not true/false, and if you set it too sensitive you will get a positive result for traces of the virus up to 2 months after you're rid of it. If you set the threshold too high, you risk missing cases where the patient is still able to infect others. It's difficult to get right, <em>that's what this article is about</em>, not that tests are 90% useless as your phrasing indicates.</p>
<p>It's 6AM here now so the rest of your suggested proof will have to wait, but I appreciate your effort. At least you're trying, unlike most people in this sub.</p>

<p>"You're thinking of Fauci", is that a point at all? If you're referring to your own comment, it was just a perfect example of gish gallop, a bad faith argument that puts the responsibility to debunk every item on the other party. Throw a bunch of shit on the wall and see what sticks.</p>
<p>To demonstrate that, I chose only two of your claims+source pairs as it was pretty late at night. I'd love to do more.</p>
<p>You shared a 25 year old clip where a demonstrably biased person talks about the detection of HIV virus in AIDS patients, that if you design PCR tests to be sensitive enough you can detect a tiny trace of anything in anything, and likens that to Buddhist philosophy. Major <em>[citation needed]</em> there. The context here is that he's trying to frame AIDS as a big-pharma conspiracy to a laymen audience, and you are trying to take that soundbite and fit it your agenda.</p>
<p>The concern you raised with the Mullis clip, and what it means, is directly explained in the other source I talked about. It's part of a lengthy discussion on what the optimal cutoff point is to reliably determine that a patient is infected. Mullis is basically saying that the threshold can go so low as to give 100% positive answers, which makes the test worthless, and the other source debates what the threshold for COVID should be.</p>
<p>If the point you're making is "if you do the test wrong, it doesn't work", then I agree. That is obvious.</p>

<p>Yes. Fauci thought more people were going to die if AIDS within a few years, than have died to date. When looking at kids getting aids he ignored the fact they were recently born with parents who had aids. Fauci ignored the higher transmission rates in the gay community and blamed heterosexuals. I'm fairly certain he even claimed that it was airborne at one point. </p>
<p>Fauci, the spokesman for the WuFlu is far worse than the man I've talked about. Yet you ignore that. Not that either matters. A character assassination bssed off of previous years isn't relevant right now. So I'm still not sure why you think ad hominem attacks instead of looking at the facts is a good idea by any means.</p>

<p>It's funny. If I don't cite any sources you'll call me an idiot who needs to substantiate my claims.</p>
<p>If I linked one, you'd call it cherry picked.</p>
<p>If I linked a couple, you'll call it a statistical outlier.</p>
<p>I can list well over 300 sources to back up my claims. And somehow you dislike that. You think that sibstantiated claims are bad. Why? You can't debunk them. I've been using them for months. Many have tried. They've all failed.</p>
<p>&rt;To demonstrate that, I chose only two of your claims+source pairs as it was pretty late at night.</p>

<p>Yes, and right now due WuFlu test is using FAR to many cycles and is not in any way a reliable test.</p>

        <p>&rt;Fauci thought more people were going to die if AIDS within a few years, than have died to date.</p>
<p>Fauci relayed estimates of 1 million Americans being infected by HIV in 1986, and based on (clearly stated) guesswork, that 40% of those would develop AIDS. The New York Times used those numbers to estimate up to a million people dead over 10 years. About 1.2mil people in the US have been diagnosed with <strong>developed AIDS</strong> , and about 700,000 have died to this day, so the number given by <strong>NYT</strong> was way off. Instead of 1,000,000 in 10 years, we got 700,000 in 30 years. <strong>A major point to be made here is that these estimates were based on what would happen if nothing were introduced to help prevent the spread of the disease.</strong> Which we did, which was the whole point of publicly stating that in the first place. <strong>Another point is that these were ESTIMATES in what were still early times of the AIDS epidemic.</strong> Jesus, a few years prior no one knew if this was even a bacteria or a virus, I'd cut some slack on him not being completely clairvoyant. Given that, I think this point does nothing to indicate malice or even incompetence on his part.  </p>
<p>&rt;When looking at kids getting aids he ignored the fact they were recently born with parents who had aids.</p>
<p>I can't find anything on this, or your next point, so I'm just going to assume you mean this as a proof of malice, while it might as well be lack of, or wrongful, information that led to that being "ignored".  </p>
<p>&rt;A character assassination bssed off of previous years isn't relevant right now. So I'm still not sure why you think ad hominem attacks instead of looking at the facts is a good idea by any means.</p>
<p>It's not a character assassination. You fail to see the problem with equating those two people in this setting. I highlighted the <strong>motivations</strong> behind Mullis' words, motivations that he were pretty explicit and open about, that has to be taken into consideration or else you miss some of his intended meaning. This isn't "previous years" either, my critique of him was <em>directly relevant</em> to the video you linked and was around the same time. This video is him using his credentials to push his alternative personal beliefs about HIV/AIDS. I did not question his competence.  </p>
<p>Your framing of Fauci, on the other hand, clearly is an assassination attempt. Your examples boils down to "see, he can be wrong", while ignoring what science is all about. He has been lauded for his ability to admit he's wrong and change his stance based on new evidence, that is <em>not</em> something you criticize a scientist for. That just shows ignorance. Science isn't scripture.  </p>
<p>That being said, I'm by no means obligated to defend Fauci here. This is what I meant when I said "whataboutism". This is <em>your</em> claims we're talking about, that you are supposed to defend.  </p>
<p>&rt;You can't debunk them. I've been using them for months. Many have tried. They've all failed.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that, and find it way more likely that you fail to accept when they have been disproved.  </p>
<p>&rt;Not at all. The context here is that the PCR test <strong>can</strong> be used ineffectively and cause many false positives to inflate the number of cases and <strong>fake a pandemic</strong>.</p>
<p>You're missing a vital piece of the puzzle here. It can also be used to <em>deflate</em> the amount of positive results. I hope you have grasped by now that being infected isn't a purely true/false value, it's a spectrum, but turning that into integers requires you to set a point for whether it should count or not. Based on what you write I think you get that bit. The last bit here, how overly sensitive PCR tests can be used to create a false impression of infection rates are obvious. <em>Yes, lying is something humans are capable off.</em> At one point though, those numbers need to match up with reality and be compared to deaths and hospital admissions.  </p>
<p>You also assume that just because a test <em>can</em> be done wrong, it's intentionally done wrong across the globe. Here we get into the sheer complexity of pulling off that feat of coordinating and controlling labs and individual teams of medical professionals across the globe to prevent them from using the test correctly. Remember, <em>PCR is a technique,</em> for it to be done wrong the people applying the technique has to do it wrong. Fuck man, this is exactly why it's being discussed in the first place, it's sharing of information and debate on a very public issue where viewpoints from all across the world are being talked about. Picking one of them as proof in itself misses the rest of the discussion.  </p>
<p>Your sources aren't worth shit if you're not able to put them in a meaningful context. It's just "hmmm doesn't THIS snippet sound suspicious?" amplified by the number of sources, which points no no conclusion and just acts as colors for you to paint your picture with; if you have enough colors you can paint anything you want!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.econlib.org/great-moments-in-epidemiology/">Arye Rubinstein was astounded that Anthony Fauci could be so stupid as to say that household contact might have anything to do with spreading AIDS. Rubinstein had never been a great admirer of New Jersey’s Dr. Oleske; they had antithetical views of AIDS in children. To Rubinstein, the mode of transmission was fairly obvious and fit quite well with existing epidemiological data on AIDS. The mother obviously infected the child in her womb. The fetus and parent shared blood as surely as an intravenous drug user, hemophiliac, or blood transfusion recipient. The fact that none of the infants in Oleske’s study were over one year old reinforced this notion. In order to interpret this data to mean that “routine household contact” might spread AIDS, an entirely new paradigm for AIDS transmission was needed. Rubinstein’s paper explained it all very easily, though the Journal of the American Medical Associationseemed more enamored with Oleske’s specious analysis. In fact, the journal editor at first returned Rubinstein’s paper with the section on intrauterine transmission crossed out. The paragraphs had only appeared because Rubinstein had insisted that they be retained.
What was Fauci’s problem?
Upon investigation, Rubinstein learned that Anthony Fauci had not bothered to read his paper [I presume Shilts means Rubinstein’s paper] before writing the editorial. Instead, he just read Oleske’s conclusions and started running off at the mouth.</a></p>
<p>&rt;It's not a character assassination</p>
<p>It is. It has nothing to do with the WuFlu. You want to remove validity based upon another event that has no relevance to today.</p>
<p>&rt;Your framing of Fauci, on the other hand, clearly is an assassination attempt</p>
<p>Not at all. It's nothing more than you have tried to do. </p>
<p>&rt;That just shows ignorance. Science isn't scripture. </p>
<p>Ignorance like Fauci not reading a fucking study and taking it as scripture?</p>
<p>&rt;This is your claims we're talking about, that you are supposed to defend. </p>
<p>Which I'm doing by pointing out how idiotic your argument is.</p>
<p>&rt;It can also be used to deflate the amount of positive results.</p>
<p>Sure. Except there's obviously not the case here. Unless you want to talk about how people getting tested after getting vaccinated are <a href="https://sentinelksmo.org/cdc-maximum-28-ct-for-post-vaccine-covid-pcr-tests/">being tested with a lower number of cycles</a>. And that's of course before we get into the fact that they've changed cycles many times, such as after the election. </p>
<p>&rt;At one point though, those numbers need to match up with reality and be compared to deaths and hospital admissions. </p>
<p>Which doesn't happen. </p>
<p><a href="https://notthebee.com/article/a-few-days-ago-johns-hopkins-published-a-study-saying-corona-is-nbd-they-then-deleted-it-read-it-here-in-its-entirety">This trend is completely contrary to the pattern observed in all previous years. Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading. Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19.</a></p>
<p>And when you look at the comorbidities...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death.</a></p>
<p>It starts to line up. </p>
<p>&rt;it's intentionally done wrong across the globe.</p>
<p>Yes. And it is. </p>
<p>&rt;Here we get into the sheer complexity of pulling off that feat of coordinating and controlling labs and individual teams of medical professionals across the globe to prevent them from using the test correctly.</p>
<p>You kidding? That's fucking easy.</p>
<p>"Dr. Fauci, may mask be upon him, decided that all tests must be ran at 42 cycles. As a result, run all PCR tests at 42 cycles."</p>
<p>Done. </p>
<p>This isn't changing the way the test is done. It's essentially changing a variable that is meant to be changed between different viruses <em>as is</em> as different viruses have distant viral loads. </p>
<p>&rt;Your sources aren't worth shit if you're not able to put them in a meaningful context.</p>
<p>I have put them into a context. Your inability to accept you may be wrong isn't my problem.</p>
<p>Come back here when you have an actual argument instead of this rambling.</p>

        <p>&rt;Look I don't give a shit about aids.</p>
<p>That's fine. Remove that angle from your narrative.  </p>
<p>&rt;When looking at kids getting aids he ignored the fact they were recently born with parents who had aids.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing the source, if you read it you will see that what you said here doesn't apply at all.<br>
The case you linked is about a comment made by Fauci about the implications of a study. Saying "When looking at" implies that this was research conducted by, or on behalf of, Fauci. The critique is that Fauci commented on the conclusions made by someone else without reading the original paper, not that he "ignored the fact". This is just scientists being salty.  </p>
<p>&rt;You want to remove validity based upon another event that has no relevance to today.</p>
<p>Your source <em>was</em> the event. You decided to make that the argument when you referenced him trying to convince people that there is no link between HIV and AIDS. You are taking a soundbite out of context and complain when that context is reintroduced. Either you accept that context, or you remove it entirely from your collection of proof as it would be lying to present it this way.  </p>
<p>&rt;Ignorance like Fauci not reading a fucking study and taking it as scripture?</p>
<p>Again, read your source. I don't think your interpretation there is valid.  </p>
<p>&rt;Which doesn't happen.</p>
<p>You fail to mention that the study was redacted because it was widely misinterpreted and used to spread dangerous misinformation (case in point). This is important information that is being weaponized by the anti-vaccination movement, and it's sadly ironic to see how they are hurting the scientific discourse that is trying to bring some nuance.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
<em>Briand’s study should not be used exclusively in understanding the impact of COVID-19, but should be taken in context with the countless other data published by Hopkins, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</em> <br>
<em>As assistant director for the Master’s in Applied Economics program at Hopkins, Briand is neither a medical professional nor a disease researcher. At her talk, she herself stated that more research and data are needed to understand the effects of COVID-19 in the U.S.</em></p>
<p>That being said, I'm absolutely not arguing that there aren't exaggerated numbers and hysteria playing into all this, because <em>of course it is.</em> This has been a huge mess on so many fronts, but the rampant misinformation spread in anti-vaccination communities acts as a direct cause to make the scientific community wary of openly discussing anything that might be used to fuel their sentiments. Because of them, scientists have to weigh the potential damage of lower vaccination rates and higher infection rates, against the benefits and importance of publicly sharing information.  </p>
<p>&rt;You kidding? That's fucking easy.<br>
"Dr. Fauci, may mask be upon him, decided that all tests must be ran at 42 cycles. As a result, run all PCR tests at 42 cycles."<br>
Done.</p>
<p>I don't think I really need to point out how US-centered this view is, Fauci isn't the king of COVID. Quickly glancing over the sources used by the health department in my country reveals that American research institutions constitutes only a small fraction of the studies. This is an international effort by a myriad of individual research cells, all seeking to be heard. The US has lost a lot of its remaining credibility over the last year, both by severely mishandling the virus and by outwardly showing that their society is rapidly deteriorating due to politics.  </p>
<p>The attempt by many to frame everything that is going on as if it is all part of US politics is frankly pathetic and just reinforces the old American stereotype. That COVID has been used as a political tool there, reported misleadingly and withholding information from the public for political reasons, <em>that</em> I'm totally on board with. Attempting to extend what happens in their backyard to the world stage, on the other hand... is getting trite.  </p>

        <p>&rt;Again, read your source. I don't think your interpretation there is valid. </p>
<p>I have read it. Fauci read the foot notes of a study and didn't even look at how it was conducted, resulting in him litterally spreading misinformation. There's no other take from that source bud.</p>
<p>&rt;You fail to mention that the study was redacted because it was widely misinterpreted and used to spread dangerous misinformation</p>
<p>Not at all. It was redacted as it went against the narrative. It shows a reduction in deaths from annual sources with an equal increase in WuFlu deaths. Again, combined with what we know about comorbidities, this is exactly what we would except to happen. </p>
<p>Instead the narrative is that every single death is the sole responsibility of the WuFlu.</p>
<p>&rt;This is important information that is being weaponized by the anti-vaccination movement, and it's sadly ironic to see how they are hurting the scientific discourse that is trying to bring some nuance. </p>
<p>Few funny things here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your the only one to bring up vaccinations here. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one here is anti vaxx. We're specifically against the one vaccine that's not FDA approved, has killed more people than any other vaccine in 20 years, and litterally isn't needed by anyone under 50, as they have a higher chance of dying in a car crash </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hurting the science discorse my ass. Your type burried the very <em>idea</em> that the WuFlu may have come from a lab. But now that Trump is out of office suddenly it's not at all a bad idea. The left has ignored science at every turn, that is why they want to censor people. Oh, and let's not start on hydroxychloroquine and how it's worked the entire time. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Are you just incapable of telling a truth?</p>
<p>&rt;Because of them, scientists have to weigh the potential damage of lower vaccination rates and higher infection rates, against the benefits and importance of publicly sharing information. </p>
<p>There's no danger in either case rates nor low vaccine rates. This has shown to be a non lethal virus.</p>
<p>&rt;I don't think I really need to point out how US-centered this view is,</p>
<p>I'm Canadian.</p>
<p>&rt;This is an international effort by a myriad of individual research cells, all seeking to be heard.</p>
<p>So why did no one look into the lab leak Theroy?</p>
<p>Why did no one do a true study on hydroxychloroquine? </p>
<p>Maybe it's because entire countries were bribed to lock down and follow<a href="https://flipboard.com/article/belarusian-president-claims-imf-world-bank-offered-him-a-bribe-to-impose-covid/f-fbed632961%2Farmstrongeconomics.com"> suit, like Belarus.</a></p>
<p>&rt;The US has lost a lot of its remaining credibility over the last year, both by severely mishandling the virus and by outwardly showing that their society is rapidly deteriorating due to politics. </p>
<p>The only bad thing the US did was implement restrictions. Not a single precaution was ever needed. Every other country has shown their residents do not have rights and are Tyrannical States.</p>
<p>&rt;The attempt by many to frame everything that is going on as if it is all part of US politics is frankly pathetic and just reinforces the old American stereotype.</p>
<p>I literally live in Saskatchewan. Like, it's really telling you're making assumptions about an easily verified fact.</p>
<p>Anyhow, yeah, the Democrats made it political when Nancy Pelosi said to come on down to China Town as it was all starting. The entire democratic party made it political when they attacked Trump for imposing restrictions. The media made it political when they ran smear campaigns on topics like the lab leak Theroy. Kamala made it political when she said she wouldn't take Trump's vaccine. The entire left makes it political by posing with masks then immediately taking them off and acting normal when the cameras are off. </p>
<p>The idea of restrictions on freedom is an inherently left wing idea, and as it shows, they're the ones that made it political at every step of the way.</p>
<p>&rt;reported misleadingly and withholding information from the public for political reasons,</p>
<p>Such as how deaths are up to 25% inflated in some counties?</p>
<p><a href="https://oaklandside.org/2021/06/04/alameda-countys-new-covid-death-toll-is-25-lower-than-thought/">Alameda County’s new COVID death toll is 25% lower than thought</a></p>
<p>How entire topics of discussion are banned from the public eye such as the lab leak theroy? How places like Facebook and YouTube would, given their current rules, have banned you for saying to wear a mask in March/April, and how even Reddit has called maskies idiots in the past?</p>
<p>https://archive.ph/Cy7E0</p>
<p>If you want to suppress information, you are an enemy of the people. </p>
<p>Keep in mind the WHO is on the record of making the claim that there was no human to human transmission of the WuFlu. Call me a little nuts, but if a disease is in more than 6 people in a town, I'm going to assume it's contagious off the bat and go from there. </p>
<p>But that's no surprise. After all the WHO is so deep in China's pocket they don't recognize Taiwan, and hung up on a reporter doing an interview instead of simply talking about that country.</p>
<p>&rt;Attempting to extend what happens in their backyard to the world stage, on the other hand... is getting trite. </p>
<p>Like how the idiots from Australia and New Zealand try to force the rest of the world to lock down? Like how China influences a global organization like the who to shift blame away from themselves?</p>
<p>It's also don't funny you hate on america Moderna, Pfizer, both American companies. The vaccine is American. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca is European, sure. They're also banned in Canada for blood clots. </p>
<p>The only reason we have vaccines right now is due to Trump, and the American pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>Like if you don't want the vaccines globally, you're free not to get one and wait for your country to offer a locally made version.</p>
<p>&rt;Real talk: I really, really appreciate you taking your time to do this. Even though we might never see eye to eye, I honestly believe you're contributing to the betterment of the world by having this lengthy conversation with someone who you obviously find really annoying, or even see as a total piece of shit.

<p>I think your views are inherently evil and dangerous. You applaud the removal of Rights and freedoms, and refuse to do any work yourself. You support censorship, as well as hiding the truth in order to spread propaganda. You likely support mask mandates and quarantine, which litterally is a human rights violation. I think you need to really re-evaluate your priorities in life. There's no reason for the government to force you to be healthy. Especially when "being healthy" is closing gyms, while letting McDonald's stay open.</p>

        <p>This is so tiresome. I have no idea how you, as one of the few people in the world, were able to be so dense as to take a guy like Lukashenko at his word. That shows a comical lack of insight into European politics. Worst of all, that "insight" is from what is basically an advertisement for an American blog that sells sketchy financial products. The nature of your sources reveals a lot about how you approach research.  </p>
<p>You then go on to say you're Canadian (how fun for you, but that's irrelevant), and spend half your post outlining a purely US-centered view as if it applies to the world. You then manage the fantastic feat of thinking the American two-party system represents the political spectrum, conflate "left-wing" with authoritarianism and believing the poorly written populist soap opera that US media pushed down your throat.  </p>
<p>You fell for the obvious ploy, which is ironic. You let it distract you. You allowed a pathological liar to act as your lens to the world, to tell you what was true or not, because it seemed to confirm your prejudices and preconceptions. You reduced a worldwide issue down to fit within the two boxes given to you by US media, because it's easier to make sense of that way. You let them draw a caricature of some imaginary "leftist" to focus all your impotent anger at, to blame everything on so you don't question the boot on your neck, just the same as what the American "left" does towards conservatives.  </p>
<p>You're a libertarian who fell into strongman-worship because they convinced you that you were under attack. You fell for the oldest trick in the  fascist playbook. You even believe it when that far-right system touts "freedom" as its core tenet while simultaneously having a quarter of the worlds total prison population and almost non-existent social mobility, that capitalism controlled by a non-elected tiny elite somehow isn't an oligarchy because maybe, <em>maybe</em> one day that could be you at the top!  </p>
<p>Expand your horizons, read some political theory, head outside your bubble and tune out the American reality show for a while. That should help inoculate you a little from just acting like Trumps little sock puppet.</p>

<p>The CDC has clearly stated that, of that number, only 6% of the deaths were solely caused by Covid.

        <p>Did you see the situation in India a month ago? Or in Italy in March April 2020? Just listing a couple.
Yes Covid is manageable but that can be done only as long as there are enough resources to take care of people who get Covid which is small number of people at any given time. This is the logic behind flattening the curve. Once the number of Covid cases reach beyond the health care facilities, people start dying. And that happened in India couple of months ago with people still taking some precautions. Imagine if we all go back to Normal in April 2020. Millions would die.</p>

<p>The supermarkets never collapsed. </p>
<p>The hospitals never collapsed.</p>
<p>Essential businesses never collapsed.</p>
<p>This is good news. It means we never really needed to shut down. Nor do we need to be continuing to be shut down. </p>
<p>I honestly do not know how you can compare india to canada. The population density. The population genetics. The populations lifestyle.  The populations wealth. The geography. There are a fuck ton of factors that influence the spread of a contagious virus.</p>
<p>Do not be ignorant to the fact the world is NOT a fair place. You have no basis to compare india to canada. That is just fucking silly.</p>

        <p>As an Indian who moved to Canada recently, I couldn't agree more with this. Two different countries. Just one example: hospitals and pharmacists are selling placebo-like medications or selling useless expensive drugs like remdesevir at 10x actual price, in cahoots with unscrupulous black marketers. They don't care if you die. Make hay while the sun shines is the mantra.</p>
<p>Ironically, the person you replied to betrayed his true opinion by stating  "covid is manageable." Lol can't be a hypocrite for long without being caught.</p>

        <p>That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard this week. Please explain to me how excess deaths are tied with population...</p>
<p>Negative excess deaths is negative excess deaths, regardless of population size / density.</p>
<p>Also, nobody cares about infection rate as long as mortality remains low.</p>

        <p>Nobody is saying that Covid deaths weren't going to happen. The point is that hospitals were never overrun, people were never dying in the streets, etc. </p>
<p>California had an entire extreme lockdown and yet they had comparable Covid deaths (63k with a 39.5 million population, compared to 37k with a 21.5 million pop)</p>
<p>So. California has an extreme lockdown and Florida has nothing- Florida has mass gatherings, no masks, bars open. And yet Covid spread in a similar rate to California that had exteme lockdown and mask mandates. </p>
<p>But suuuure yeah keep thinking that lockdowns do more good than harm. Kill small businesses, increase the wealth gap and make the likes of Amazon and WalMart richer, kill mental health and make resources for homeless near impossible. Definitely worth it 🙄</p>

        <p>I thought this thread started about testing for coronavirus. I think their lust for testing is just to drive higher case numbers to make people scared despite the vast majority of cases being asymptomatic. Thus the pandemic is a hoax. </p>
<p>Yes virus is scary and deadly. But people should not be forcing their neighbors to close their businesses or wear masks in 90° weather. The pandemic response has been a fucking disgrace since the beginning. I'm pissed off at people who insist we had any fucking control over a viral contagion. </p>
<p>Its a fucking force of nature and humans are just not that powerful to stop it. Let me know how nuking a hurricane works.</p>

        <p>Its my opinion that a lockdown should be an absolute last resort. Essentially at the point when society is already on the brink of collapse and Martial law is to be declared </p>
<p>To lock down prior to that is just infantile. Citizens should be able to make their own risk assessment for their own lives. </p>
<p>If you are frightened to leave your house than by all means stay home. Dont force the rest of the world to stay home. </p>
<p>I don't go sky diving because it's too risky. But I'm not going to tell other people they aren't allowed to.</p>

        <p>No its not and thats bullshit.</p>
<p>Essential businesses kept working. The semi trucks never stopped coming from the usa to canada. They never stopped traveling between provinces. It was a fucking lie. Stop pretending it wasn't. Your not helping. </p>
<p>They never had any fucking control over an airborne vital contagion that travels between humans. Stop kidding yourself.</p>
<p>The lockdowns and masking were simply to break people's spirit. Close their businesses. And make them excited to take a fucking experimental drug to get thier freedom back. </p>
<p>Those are the facts. If you cant accept it than you are part of the problem.</p>

        <p>Your first mistake is believing 500k Americans died FROM covid.  They rigged the testing and then recorded every death that tested positive as a covid death.  It's a sham dude.  I'll cut you a little slack for buying into this thing in the beginning.  By now you are just being willfully ignorant.  Doesn't it seem odd to you that no matter the circumstances, if you tested positive it was recorded as covid death?  Heck sometimes they didn't even test. Just said it was likely causes by covid.  That they stopped recording flu deaths?  That the average age of death is 78, and what do you know, it's also the average date of death overall.  Who would have thought that all other causes of death rates would abnormally plummet.</p>

        <p>360000 more Americans died than the average last year, a massive spike in deaths. This ranged over many age groups. No matter what you try to say you can't pretend that 360,000 extra deaths happened just in America in 2020.</p>

        <p>You just made up some bullshit. Respiratory viruses primarily spread through fomites. If it was a lethal virus, they would need to be in a hazmat suit to be safe, not handling swabs with gloves. The people taking tests would also need to be in hazmat suits, and would need to sterilize between tests to avoid spreading the virus.</p>

        <p>That's a lot of assumptions about "they". Do you believe this is a universal thing, that in the testing centers around the world people don't wear gloves or masks, lack contact tracing, "infection control procedures" (whatever you mean by that), and people staffing those places completely avoids taking the vaccine?</p>

        <p>So who were you talking about then? I know you weren't referring to the handling of serin gas in a laboratory, as you mention infection procedures and vaccines which has nothing to do with that. So at first I thought you were sarcastic about a lab technician in that scenario not using PPE, that didn't fit with the rest of your comment.</p>
<p>I then assumed you must be talking about the anecdote from the earlier comment here about no precautions being done on a testing site, which was a better fit. I engaged you on that, as I interpreted it as you taking that as something that is generally true about testing sites. Which was false I guess, you apparently don't believe that.</p>
<p>You might be hindered by a lack of empathy, but you should know that it's your responsibility to make sure that you've been understood, especially when asked to clarify. This can be difficult to grasp if you lack the ability to put yourself in others shoes, but assholes tend to just sling insults and expects that everyone should be able to dig out that tiny grain of meaning in their incoherent bullshit.</p>

        <p>Haha, exactly.  Don’t these people wonder why more people of notoriety haven’t died of the deadliest virus in history?  Its because social distancing and masks work.  But if they work why is this pandemic still supposedly raging 18 months later…….that’s becaose people aren’t doing it right…….it’s like having an argument with a schizophrenic.</p>

        <p>Well that republican senator died like a year ago.  Most government figures(not ignorant conservatives) actually are adults and wear their masks or make and effort not to spreadit plus they get the highest treatmeat around and daily tests. Such as trump.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson didnt make any effort to lockdown too quickly originally and he got it himself and it scared him but as i said these guys get well looked after.</p>

        <p>The proper PPE?  I'm willing to bet that close to 100% of mask use did more harm than good.  Masks made from recycled t-shirts were a joke.  Masks worn 2 weeks straight were a joke.  Filthy germ infested hands fidgeting with masks all day long was a joke.  Having gaps all around the mask was a joke as well. That sums up 99% of people wearing masks. Wearing one in a restaurant until you sat down was a joke.  Wearing one out freaking side is a joke.  You're a joke.  Why in the world didn't states that didn't have mask mandated see everybody die?  Common sense is free man.</p>

        <p>My favorite is when our stores wouldn’t pack your groceries in your own reusable bags (you pay to use store bags in my state). If you wanted to use them you had to pack your own groceries. Even though they just handled all of your groceries…the Covid is only on the scary reusable bags <em>shudder</em></p>

        <p>That's for the benefit of the person behind. If somebody brings in nasty-ass cat-piss reusable bags, the clerk doesn't touch them and then touch <em>my</em> groceries. Not touching reusable bags was a policy before covid, at least where I live.</p>

        <p>Its so obvious how you don't get it. These things needs to happen. You need to go shopping etc. You cant not make people touch their grocerys. You notice the signs around supermarkets? You read them ever? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you sanitise, don't touch your face'wear a mask and keep a safe distance then  if ten people touch your groceries and the ten people have done this then it won't spread.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you only do one of these things the odds go up. If you do none like what american did originally then 100,000 people die. So simple yet people choose to be selfish and childish.</p>

        <p>Do me a favour, go grab yourself a plate. Put the plate infront of your mouth about a 6 inches away and your hand behind the plate. Blow. Feel the wind of your hand? No? Thats the purpose of the screen. 99% of the breath and droplets of water in said breath hit the screen, yes the 1% travels around but 99% is pretty damn good</p>

As the air flows toward the plate it is blocked and flows around the plate and the water particles in the air are caught on the plate, again this is 100% of the water particles, some get by but it is drastically reduced</p>

        <p>Water particles are heavy, people walking round aren't going to do anything to them unless they walk into them. Something like AC might affect the flow of the air but if you're stood at a normal distance like 50cm from a screen then a very large proportion of the water particles that leave your mouth will hit the screen or go no where near it. The point of the screen is to block the particles going straight into someone's face and as i said not to stop it going round as exponentially less particles do so

<p>Like, bud. If you've ever been in any cold area you'll see your breath rise. </p>

<li>
<p>Yet it floats. Almost as if things can be suspended in air due to <em>density</em> and not weight. This is literally how boats work. Metal is heavier than water, but when you have a bunch of air inside, the average weight is significantly lowered allowing the 100000 ton aircraft carrier to float.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, the rooms door. And no, you specifically mentioned AC, a device designed to move air, while ignoring litterally every moving object causes a draft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other comment because you started two chains bud. Jesus fkn Christ I hate when people don't get the basics of a discussion and reply multiple times to a single post as if that's somehow logical. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn't matter is the best argument when the thing doesn't matter. Again, how many particles are needed for a 50% chance at infection? 20% chance? You're making claims that cannot be backed up, and can't even be fully substantiated as you're missing a key part of the conversation, the end point.</p>

        <p>There is very much practical value here😂 these visualisation are to demonstrate basic concepts. And thats not how germs work, there isn't some threshold amount that suddenly cause you to get ill. The more germs the more likely you are to get ill, the screens reduce the germs and in turn reduce the odds of you getting ill. 
Screens are a part of a multi step process of reducing risk of catching covid. Where i work we wash our hands every half hour, have pyrex screens between each employee and where masks. There is about1 covid case at a small place the employees 200 people every month. These individual cases have never spread at my work because we take precautions. Find my somewhere where that many people work in that small of a place with no precautions and covid is that rare and i will believe you</p>

        <p>&rt;these visualisation are to demonstrate basic concepts.</p>
<p>Life isn't a basic concept. Simulations are worthless here. We've seen this time and time again, there's been essentially no correct simulation about the WuFlu. </p>
<p>&rt;The more germs the more likely you are to get ill, the screens reduce the germs and in turn reduce the odds of you getting ill.</p>
<p>Except there's always significant numbers. </p>
<p>If I shoot someone once they're likely to live.</p>
<p>Twice less likely to live.</p>
<p>10, almost impossible to live.</p>
<p>100, dead.</p>
<p>1000, there's no body left.</p>
<p>Sure, it's a game of statistics. But there's such a thing as a point where it becomes significant. </p>
<p>&rt;Screens are a part of a multi step process of reducing risk of catching covid</p>
<p>Which there is no reason for. It's a non deadly non contagious virus.</p>
<p>&rt;Where i work we wash our hands every half hour, have pyrex screens between each employee and where masks.</p>
<p>Cool. Where I work no one bothers if there's no customers, no one washes their hands unless they took a shit, and we've never had a case. </p>
<p>I look through a window to the test site in my facility, and even the testers don't wear masks unless there's other people there. </p>
<p>&rt;These individual cases have never spread at my work because we take precautions.</p>
<p>Likely wouldn't have spread anyways. Masks are shown to be less than 2% effective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm">"Mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease [...] in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1–20 days after implementation and decreases of [...] 1.8 percentage points [after] 81–100 days."</a></p>
<p>Oh, and washing hands is literally pointless. Surface transmission has been debunked so many times by <em>mainstream</em> sources.</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4</p>
<p>https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/why-you-probably-still-shouldn-t-worry-about-surface-transmission-of-the-coronavirus-1.5330561</p>
<p>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/health/cdc-coronavirus-touching-surfaces.html</p>
<p>This isn't a contagious virus. </p>
<p>&rt;Find my somewhere where that many people work in that small of a place with no precautions and covid is that rare and i will believe you </p>
<p>Naw I'm good. I'm not going to go door to door doing a study for some baseless claim on Reddit. But what I can say is I don't know a single fucking person who's even had to go to the hospital, let alone died. Including a literal cancer patient who came to anti mask rallies with me. </p>
<p>Not a single precaution is needed for this virus. And as time goes on we will see this for what it was.</p>

        <p>"Hand washing is crucial, says Marr" literally in the nature.com article.
If the virus wasn't contagious there would be a total number of 0 infections, you do know what contagious means right?
As for the bullets thing youre just illustrating the usefulness of screens, they reduce the numbers by a huge amount reduce the risk of infection by a huge amount.
And again simulations are very much important. They're responsible for the huge mega structures that tower in our sky and for the vehicles that allow us to fly over them. Even in a chaotic system, simulations are paramount.</p>

        <p>She also says not to disinfect.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;“It’s become clear that transmission by inhalation of aerosols — the microscopic droplets — is an important if not dominant mode of transmission,” says Marr, who studies airborne disease transmission. Excessive attention on making surfaces pristine takes up limited time and resources that would be better spent on ventilation or the decontamination of the air that people breathe, she says.</p>
<p>It's not a concern.</p>
<p>In September 2019 there were 100 cases of the WuFlu in Italy.</p>
<p>https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2020-11-17/COVID-19-was-spreading-in-Italy-by-September-2019-study-indicates-VuSqUttP8s/index.html</p>
<p>No one did anyone until March 2020.</p>
<p>The time span between March 2020, and September 2019 is around 7 or so months.</p>
<p>If we use the commonly reported "exponential growth" claim.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/exponential-growth-what-it-is-why-it-matters-and-how-to-spot-it/">Our second way of understanding exponential growth is to think of doubling times.  From that 22%, I calculate a doubling time of 2.7 days, so I’ve highlighted in bold, every third day in the table.  Decide for yourself: is the number of cases roughly doubling between each highlighted row?  The “exponential growth” way of looking at this data is not exactly right, but in my view it’s not far wrong.</a></p>
<p>Forbes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/03/17/why-exponential-growth-is-so-scary-for-the-covid-19-coronavirus/?sh=4ddb126e4e9b">the exponential nature of the infection transmission isn’t stemmed in any way, there will be 1024 infected people on January 31: about a thousand times as many as you began with. That’s a lot, but remember that this continues to double every three days as long as this growth remains exponential. On February 3, there will be twice as many: 2048 infected. On February 6, that rises to 4096. By the time you get to March 19, which is 78 days after the initial infection, some 67 million people will be infected.</a></p>
<p>Washington Post.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/03/27/what-does-exponential-growth-mean-context-covid-19/">For coronavirus infections, the doubling time in the United States has been about 2½ days. That means that, on average, the number of reported covid-19 cases doubles every 2½ days. </a></p>
<p>USA today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/28/coronavirus-cases-growing-rapidly-exponential-growth/2922091001/">For COVID-19, that number is likely higher than two, according to Melissa Nolan, an infectious disease expert and professor at the University of South Carolina. One sick person quickly becomes two; two becomes four; four becomes eight. Graph it on a chart, and the line quickly skyrockets upward.</a></p>
<p>We should have over 100 billion cases.</p>
<p>Huh that's weird. We didn't. </p>
<p>Almost as if the science was wrong yet again, and this isn't that bad of a disease. </p>
<p>Tell me, in 7 months with <strong>no mitigation measures</strong> how did we not all die? No one wore masks, no one sanitized, people bought mattresses. It was <em>chaos</em>. Where's the deaths? </p>
<p>The virus isn't highly contagious by any means. </p>
<p>&rt;As for the bullets thing youre just illustrating the usefulness of screens, they reduce the numbers by a huge amount reduce the risk of infection by a huge amount.</p>
<p>No I'm highlighting how you can't use any figures. There's no distance between being shot 1000 times, and being shot 10 times.</p>
<p>You are unable to quantify any of your results, which makes the entire basis of the argument pointless. </p>
<p>&rt;And again simulations are very much important.</p>
<p>They've shown useless for the WuFlu virus time and time again. Remember 3 million dead in America alone? </p>
<p>&rt;They're responsible for the huge mega structures that tower in our sky and for the vehicles that allow us to fly over them. Even in a chaotic system, simulations are paramount. </p>
<p>A building goes against known forces. Wind, rain, weight on levels, seismic activity, etc. There's few forces that can't be easily modeled.</p>
<p>Not that it matters, as both scale model buildings as well as equipment are also used in real world tests, such as a wind tunnel. </p>
<p>Simulations have a place. Just not anywhere near the WuFlu.</p>

        <p>Actually over 7 months starting at 100 cases and assuming a double rate of 2.5 days you'd have 2000000000000000000000000000 cases hence why when modelling you don't just use an exponential model. </p>
<p>I shouldn't need hard numbers to demonstrate that a wall between 2 people will reduce the amount of air going directly between 2 people.</p>
<p>And 600k dead in american shows you guys aren't doing to super with it. Also shows its definitely a bad disease.</p>

        <p>Yes, I cut of at 100 billion as it gets a point across, given that's the number as to how many people have ever lived in all time.</p>
<p>You need hard numbers to prove the effectiveness is worthwhile. Reducing something to .001% is great most of the time. But .001% of the ocean will still drown you. </p>
<p>The claim that COVID-19 killed around 600k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed. </p>
<p>The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does not require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The 600K figure <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">comes from the CDC</a> which states this:</p>
<p>&rt; All Deaths Involving COVID-19 [1]</p>
<p>&rt; [1] Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification</a> also states that confirmation <strong>is not required</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt; What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</p>
<p>&rt; - If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</p>
<p>&rt; - COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or <strong>is assumed to have caused or contributed to death</strong>.</p>
<p>People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, all kinds of diseases, old age, flu, accidents, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moreover, having <strong>a positive PCR test is not indicative of being infected with a virus</strong>:</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__Zx0qS7uI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=%2a%2aBirgit%2a%2a">find almost anything in anybody</a>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Study from november 2020: <a href="http://philosophers-stone.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-scam-has-been-confirmed-Dsalud-November-2020.pdf">PCR does not detect SARS-CoV-2 </a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease"</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Portuguese court has ruled that <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">the PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test</a>, and that "the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is <strong>97%</strong>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>

<p>TPTB are well aware that the PCR tests are not picking up what they should be picking up, so they need us to use them for testing as long as possible in order for these tests to inflate the numbers world-wide. These numbers are then used to "justify" the imposing of NWO restrictions which are meant to transform society as we know it.</p>

<p>You're in a great position to help the OP address their concerns.  What safety procedures and equipment did they have in place to protect you from contracting the virus during the testing process?</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's hard to tell on the internet sometimes: I was being serious. </p>
<p>The OP asked why people in testing centres don't have to isolate every time they're exposed to someone with COVID. And you've just given the answer: Because you take much higher levels of precautions than most people who are exposed to someone with COVID.</p>
<p>I'm surprised they didn't regularly test you, though. That seems like mismanagement. Did they make sure to vaccinate you guys? I suppose testing would be less necessary if you're vaccinated. </p>
<p>PS. Upvoting you for the helpful reply, thanks.</p>

        <p>It definitely didn’t make sense why they didn’t test us, because of course we’re human and can’t be perfect, so it wasn’t uncommon for us to forget a part or some of the PPE, forget to clean something, etc. </p>
<p>This was all of last year when we didn’t even have the vax yet, so no.</p>

        <p>I want to know why, if it's imperative that there be no false negatives, sample collection procedures are so lax that a person could avoid a positive result. I got tested twice both in drive-through situations. First time I could have pretended to swab both nostrils as the nurse watched. Second time nobody watched so I could have just not swabbed.</p>

        <p>Doesn't the 14 day quarantine only apply if you're in contact with an infected person for at least 15 minutes?</p>
<p>A worker in a testing center won't be in contact with any single infected person for more than about a minute.</p>
<p>However, if you multiple one minute by the amount of infected people they come into contact with in a day, I'm sure it would total well over 15 minutes.</p>
<p>IDK if an average person is supposed to quarantine in that situation.</p>

        <p>There were some school boards that literally considered the idea that students change desks every 14 minutes in order to avoid anybody having to quarantine.</p>

        <p>Actually, there is a lot of insane bullshit for medical professionals too.</p>
<p>I mean, you are not wrong that there is also heaps and heaps of hypocrisy, but all of the doctors and nurses (and other healthcare staff) who are not regurgitating the political agenda suffer for it in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Like most things, it's a mixed bag where everyday folks aren't the source of the problem. That includes everyday healthcare staff who are just trying to do their jobs even if they are not smart enough to understand the politics around them.</p>

        <p>Let’s be disruptive and inquisitive, not retired. Being dumbasses is what they use to discredit every other bit of logic and information coming out of here. </p>
<p>Testing personnel and doctors wear and are trained to wear proper PPE. Full body suits, sometimes tyvek ones, respirators, goggles and the like. One has to assume they are also taught or supervised on correct don/doff procedures. This is SOP in every first responder to biohazard operations and with minor modifications it should keep you (relatively) safe from the nastiest BSL4 pathogens in a practical way. Particularly in cases when you are testing and not in immediate contact with the sick and completely symptomatic. </p>
<p>Even if the flu was as bad as they say and these protocols were necessary, the practice is sound and they wouldn’t need to be quarantined. Or better put, the probability for accidental infection is so low that the few cases that Might pop
Up are operating costs.</p>

        <p>LOLs yeah, you COVIDcult morons are hilarious because it's totally unheard of medical professionals to get infected with diseases during their work, that never happens because protocols and PPE, that's why they're all unvaccinated, don't have infection control proceedures, don't wear PPE,  and don't ever get infected with diseases during their work etc etc</p>

        <p>Hi. My basic position on covid is that it is a above-averagely contageous but mostly mild respiratory illness which has been deliberately contrived as an cover for a global wealth and power grab to usher in an authoritarian new normal. I just didn't find the particular question of 'why testing staff dont have to self isolate' particularly interesting at first glance.</p>

        <p>Do you actually want the real answer? People only need to isolate if they come in contact with an infected person while not wearing a mask, or if they had masked contact for more than 15 minutes. Very brief masked contact does not have a high chance of spreading the virus. That is and has been the guideline for a while. People at testing facilities wear insane amounts of personal protective gear and constantly sanitize.</p>

        <p>Because they are masked up. Trained to maintain social distance, General washing of hands etiquette, wear gloves, not to touch their face, don't physically thouch the person with their skin. I've been tested like 15 times the last couple months and they are always ridiculous covered in ppe.</p>
<p>So whatever you believe about the virus this is why. Quite simple really</p>

        <p>The people in test centres should be wearing PPE (face shield plus mask). That's why they wouldn't need to isolate. They would isolate only if they started to display symptoms.</p>
<p>It is the same reason why doctors and nurses don't isolate after working with patients who are infected with highly infectious diseases.</p>

        <p>Lmfao PPE does nothing. Every person I know that was required to work directly with COVID patients got COVID. Their managers told them, once they start feeling better to get back to work. My sister’s manager asked her if she can come back a couple of days after finding out she had COVID.</p>

        <p>Masks provide both personal protection and protection for others. It was initially beleived they only protected others but it was later discovered they protected wearers as well.</p>

        <p>Not quite. Masks are not 100% effective, they significantly reduce transmission but only offer a high amount of protection when worn by both parties. Of course, one person wearinf a mask is better than both not wearing one, but ideally both should. However, vaccinated people need not worry either way.</p>

        <p>Yes these things can only work one way. It is just like how people say drinking and driving puts everyone around you in danger, obviously that can't be the case because it puts me in danger. Glad I have found like minded individuals here</p>

        <p>A couple easy reasons.  </p>
<p>1) Most are required to be vaccinated now, but before that...</p>
<p>2) They developed very strict procedures and policies for PPE, including redundancy.</p>
<p>That being said, many healthcare workers lived away from home, in their garage, or in some other isolated environment for a very long time in the heaviest stages and before better PPE was developed.</p>

        <p>We've already discussed this in other threads, but it's not merely "technically true".  The vaccines weren't designed to prevent infection, just lessen symptoms.  That's why it should be no surprise when he read news reports like this : <a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/special-focus/covid-19/international-update-nearly-900-twice-vaccinated-people-among-seychelles-2486-new-covid-cases/">International update: Nearly 900 twice vaccinated people among Seychelles 2,486 new Covid cases</a></p>

        <p>Most of the people in the Seychelles used some weird off-brand vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna are very effective at lowering transmission and are the reason the U.S. is seeing improvement. Furthermore, lessening symptoms reduces death rates by relieving the strain on the health care system.</p>

        <p>AZ is not a "weird off-brand vaccine" (43% of The Seychelles population took AZ).  China has banned Pfizer and Moderna because of safety concerns (a lot of countries are not using these brands out of safety concerns).</p>

        <p>65% of the people in Seychelles who got sick were not fully vaccinated. In an island where 60% of people were fully vaccinated, it does seem that the vaccines significantly reduced but not entirely eliminated the risk. The Sinopharm vaccine used on 60% of the people of the Seychelles is the off-brand ineffective one, and I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of the breakthrough cases were Sinopharm. AZ has been shown to be clinically effective in other countries, so it's likey the Sinopharm that's the problem.</p>

        <p>Your comment is rather ironic, since you've misunderstood the notion of vaccine effectiveness.  The efficacy percentages are based on <strong>relative risk reduction</strong> in regards to <strong>serious symptoms</strong>, <strong>not</strong> whether you can contract the virus or not.  And you should really read up on the difference between relative risk reduction and absolute risk reduction - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o1rjxd/absolute_risk_reduction_if_you_get_vaccinated_is/">I made a thread about it if you're interested</a>.</p>

        <p>See this is where you lose me because you're ignoring the scale of it. Of course the percentage for an <em>individual</em> is not that high and one may even be inclined to throw caution to the wind. But once you start talking about hundreds of thousands or millions of confirmed cases, a 95+% (not just 90% as you like to claim) reduction in risk in not just contracting the disease but ALSO spreading it really starts to make a huge difference really quickly. Besides, even if the risk is low, wouldn't you rather get two quick jabs as insurance? I bet you'd really feel like you were owning the libs if you were one of the unlucky ones that died.</p>

        <p>The people in Seychelles were injected with third-rate vaccines that are not approved in the U.S. Those specific vaccines were NOT effective which is why the U.S. didn't use them. Pfizer and Moderna are highly effective, which were used in the U.S and have not had significant breakthrough infections.</p>

        <p>OP most likely doesn't want a real answer, but there are two points to be made from this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most doctors/nurses who have been working during the pandemic <em>have</em> been isolating for months at a time while conducting COVID tests and working with patients. They weren't seeing family, and some were even sleeping in their garage or simply staying at the hospital to avoid exposing their loved ones to the virus.</li>
<li>In tandem with following the same social-distancing guidelines as everyone else, doctors have also been held to a higher standard of PPE code, including wearing multiple masks, as well as multiple types simultaneously (N95 on top of the 3-layer blue mask), wearing a face shield, gloves, and following more strict guidelines for handwashing.</li>
</ol>
<p>TL;DR Healthcare workers have been quarantining.</p>

<li>Wrong.  I worked in a hospital that did covid testing for the entire pandemic and they never once isolated.  They ALWAYS went home to their kids every single day after work.  They went shopping, out to eat, ran errands, and everything else normal people do each day after work.  Do you just get off on lying?  Is it sexual for you?  I'm just trying to figure out why you're lies are so far fetched and obvious.</li>
<li>And no this one isn't true either.  They do put on gowns and helmets and gloves when they walk into a covid room, but then they walk out, take it all off, and sit back down in front of their computer.  And when these nurses and doctors leave a patient area, even the masks come off.  We always chat with coworkers without masks when patients aren't around.  Then we all go home to our families.</li>
</ol>
<p>TL;DR  No one in the healthcare business is isolating.  At least not in America.</p>

        <p>When you're a biomedical electronics tech responsible for repairing and maintaining all of the life-saving machines in a hospital, you have to deal with traveling technicians on a weekly basis.  These can either be regional or national.  We talk to each other about the other hospitals.  Yes, it's called basic communication.</p>
<p>So yeah... I heard all about the empty hallways and empty beds in other hospitals just like my hospital was empty after the peak from April of 2020.  The peak was over with pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Some hospitals even shut down entire floors because there were no patients and non-essential procedures were shut down as per state mandates.  Staff were laid off. Nurses who spent years attending nursing school were checking temperatures at the hospital entrances just to keep their hours.  Then once hospitals began allowing elective surgeries once again the hospitals came to life, but it still took a long time to get back to the normal occupancy.</p>
<p>And Yes, we even talked about the hospitals in other states that didn't even have mask mandates anymore.  This means that even in patient care areas, there was no need to mask up unless you were going into a contagious patient's room.  Hallways were no-mask areas.</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you didn't pick up on it, HOSPITALS WERE USING TRAVELING TECHS DURING THE WHOLE PANDEMIC.</p>
<p>Those techs traveled around the whole country going from hospital to hospital and then back to their families.  They wouldn't even wear a mask if they didn't have to.  My electronics shop was a mask-free zone.  My hospital's policy stated that you only had to wear a mask if you were in hallways or patient care areas and my shop was neither.  This meant that techs who traveled across the country would come in, remove their mask, assist with the specialized repair, and then put on their mask to leave.</p>
<p>Do I need to talk more slowly for you?</p>
<p>P.S.  And these were just the visitors I called in.  Nurses, doctors, medical technicians- they all traveled in and out of hospitals too.  Some would bring their own equipment and I'd get called to run electrical safety checks on this equipment before it could be used in my hospital.</p>

        <p>Wait…so the general rule of self-isolating when you come into contact with someone with Covid shouldn’t apply here? That’s OP’s point. Either you are a danger to others or you’re not. Vaccinated individuals can still contract and spread the virus.</p>

        <p>what do you think happens in a testing center? Do you think they have to give a French kiss to eachother before they can get tested? If you haven't noticed health care workers try to be as sterile as can be while they work (wear masks, wear gloves, don't touch their face putting all those disgusting germs on there.) Besides, they don't really get that close in a testing center.</p>

        <p>LOL, I love how incautious someone can be in order not to upset their view of the world.  These workers come into close contact with hundreds of people everyday.  They would be the classic potential "superspreader".  Not that I'm for self-isolation and the rules, I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy.</p>
<p>This incautious attitude applies to the vaccines too. Still under trial? No problem!  Ivermectin has been used for 40 years, proven safe and proven effective as a treatment for Covid in studies...ooh, better suck in those cheeks and say "we need <strong>more</strong> testing of Ivermectin on Covid patients before we can say that's true!".</p>

        <p>Have you been to a testing center? They basically wear hazmat suits and use long grippers to take your test from you. Most are also outdoor that I have seen. The chances of them being infected are minute</p>

        <p>False! Fact check yourself. 🤣 I've walked past PLENTY of covid test centres, and the people working there don't even wear their mask properly, let alone a full on hazmat suit. Liar.</p>

        <p>That is NOT how they were dressed up. That's one picture, that doesn't mean that at all testing centres they were dressed up like that. Are you really that stupid and you think pulling a BBC link showing someone wearing a face shield is proof that all workers wore PPE? 🤣 I have been to testing centres myself in the UK as well as abroad and they literally only had a surgeons mask on. I've also walked past PLENTY here in London and the same situation applied. At the most some workers had gloves on. So OUR point still stands, yours does not.</p>
