        <p>I'm so damn glad my state doesn't follow any of this insanity.  We are 100% open and no mask mandates, and it been like this for a a while.  The bars and restaraunts are packed and nobody wears masks.  Guess what, the hospitals aren't overrun with covid patients and people aren't dying in the streets.  I can't imagine living in one of the authoritarian states.</p>

        <p>I heard they have terrific showers! This is pure theatre at this point. This is how they will get the doomers to clamor for vaccine passports by making them terrified of non-masked, non vaccinated people. I hope this whole Covid calamity has opened some people's eyes to the societies in which they live. If the rulers have this easy of a time whipping up fear over a virus with a one to two percentile death rate that irreversibly alters that society, think how easily they will fulfill other agendas they want to push. How can you have a democracy when a large part of any given population has few to no critical thinking skills. Hopefully, it makes you think.</p>

        <p>Crazy that I've been eating indoors for the majority of the pandemic. Seems perfectly safe for me. Why did businesses even need to install plexi shields, wear masks, and sanitize if it's so dangerous to be in them in the first place?</p>
