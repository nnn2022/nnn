        <p>There's no such thing as "misinformation". That's a stupid word invented to criminalize speech and frame it in some scary public health terminology. It's up to you to decide if what someone says is crackpot bullshit. You're not hearing "MisSINforMAtion", you're hearing inaccurate facts or faulty claims. And that's totally fine. Discriminating between true and false is an important part of being human</p>

        <p>You're right that the word is old. What's different is the way it's now directed towards common speech. Until recently it was rarely used when talking about things that random people say to each other in conversation. I would argue that reddit posts are conversation</p>

        <p>Not everyone from these subs support censorship. I follow both r/NoNoNewNormal and r/NoNewNormalBan because these are the only places where people are calling out the liars on this sub. Now I am not saying everyone here is a liar. But the people who say things like masks reduce oxygen levels are spreading baseless claims that have been proven wrong. There are also many racists and sexists in the comment section who are being UPVOTED, not downvoted. If they are getting upvoted, it reflects the idea that the majority of the users are fine with discrimination even though it is against the sub's rules. These subs are trying to help NoNewNormal before Reddit bans the sub for either this misinformation or the discrimination of others.</p>

        <p>I made a comment on NNNBan explaining why I follow it: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/mjg1cj/i_dont_understand_this_subreddit/gtbkyqh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/mjg1cj/i_dont_understand_this_subreddit/gtbkyqh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>
<p>The original post said this (recovered from Reveddit):</p>
<p>&rt;Why are you trying to get NNN taken down? Typically unless you're spamming or breaking Reddit TOS you are extremely unlikely to receive a ban from NNN.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They don't remove posts made by people who disagree with them, even ones that are comprised of nothing but insults. They try to discuss things with people who disagree, and don't move to instantly silence them. That's a rare thing for any sub these days.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I do not understand the mentality of wanting to forcibly silence or suppress opposition. It seems counter productive to me. If your beliefs surrounding the pandemic require as many people as possible to agree with you, why don't you engage with others and try to change their minds? I hear a lot of people say "ohh those people can't be reasoned with, I'm not wasting <strong>my time</strong> trying to convince them". Well, if you're truly on the right side, the failing is yours. If you can't explain your position in layman's terms, you don't understand it yourself and have no business admonishing others for not sharing it.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Trying to shut down a subreddit for having a different perspective to you might make you <em>feel</em> good, but if your concern truly is about misinformation or public safety then it makes no sense to go down this route.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;How many of you have actually had a conversation with NNN users? I mean real conversations, not just snapshots designed to win you internet points on here. Most people on there are just the same as you. They're worried about the direction the world is going in, like most of us are, albeit perhaps for different reasons.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There's no need for all this division. There's no cause for trying to shut down discussions you don't like. It's helping nobody.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I wonder if this post will even be allowed through. I hope so, because I am genuinely saddened by how this pandemic has made people hate each other.</p>
<p>Here was my response:</p>
<p>&rt;Hi, I'm one of the few people who reply to users on NNN. Although I am a member of this subreddit, I don't actually support the banning of NNN, although I did initially. After I was harassed by many users there I reported them and didn't think they would get banned; I didn't believe the subreddit was properly moderated. However, they were later banned, and now I don't believe the subreddit is breaking any rules. I do however report many people who are sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. so that the subreddit won't be banned. I think having an echo chamber does more good than harm, it preoccupies people.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There are a handful of people who were falsely banned and are speaking out about it here, but I can only assume it was a rogue moderator's actions.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I do enjoy having a civil discussion with some users, however they often end up in logical stalemates (because the pandemic is a multifaceted issue). I wish more people would do what I do, too often do I see comments with 100 downvotes of a person saying "You guys are idiots, stop spreading misinformation" because they truly add nothing to the conversation. If anything, these kinds of comments only polarize the two sides.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I think the direction of NNN is dangerous. 90% of the posts are memes, which is totally fine, but the comments you can find on the posts are some of the most vile things on the planet. Not only are the comments bad, but they are much more difficult to moderate (some comments get removed days after I report them). If I ever see NNN getting banned in the future, it will be because of some racist or sexist comments with 100+ upvotes, implying the majority of the users on the sub are racist or sexist.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm really fucking sick of you people saying anything that disagrees with you is dangerous. No. We‚Äôre on the side of science. Every single intelligent scientist I know thinks this whole pandemic reaction is BS. we know how to read scientific papers, we understand what statistically significant figures mean, etc. we discuss on Reddit because people like you who call us ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù would vomit or throw a hissy fit if we ever tried to engage in person. Leave this sub if you want. But stop calling us dangerous. My family has experienced awful collateral damage due to lockdowns and I‚Äôm beyond sick of close minded folks like you. 
Ps: why would we willingly choose to have opinions that go against EVERYTHING the MSM is telling us? Do you think it‚Äôs fun to be called a terrorist? No. Bye.</p>

        <p>Government organizations are part of the government.  The CDC is ignored by everyone when it's inconvenient, and touted as the almighty truth by everyone when it's convenient, I don't really care what they say, they also said that masks were useless.  They can only be right once when they contradict themselves.  But everyone will say they were right when they said "what I agree with".</p>

        <p>You're going to have crackpots in any sub like this. As people who generally support freedom and civil liberties I think it's generally understood that we're against the idea that speech must line up with science to be protected. It's good when it does, and there are many people here who only consider verified facts, but I personally couldn't care less that someone thinks masks cause cancer. That's their right to believe. </p>
<p>In regards to "racism" and "sexism", it's very difficult to separate the social environment that produced covid hysteria from the one that produced the george floyd riots/Trump panic and the attempted purging of people who didn't go along with that.</p>

If you claim to be on the side of "science", you'd know that women do favor bearing and raising children over careers (no matter how much propaganda they throw at them) and that women also value safety over freedom, men are the opposite. Theres nothing inherently wrong with this, its why women want a man who can protect, because they are physically and mentally not as strong as men as a whole. </p>
<p>You denying basic biology and calling it sexist shows why you'd participate in a stupid ass sub such as r/NoNewNormalBan. Its literally what we're describing right now, you have a feminine view and rather than let us have our space you guys have to whine and bitch about us until you get your way. We value freedom, you value safety. You're either a woman or a low T beta male, you should work on it if it's the latter.</p>

        <p>Evolutionarily, yes, women are more likely and better than men at raising children, as that is how nearly every other animal on the planet does things. However, it's degrading to apply this same evolutionary belief to a civilized society. There are single fathers out there who get along just fine raising their children, assuming the reason for the mother being out of the picture isn't because of drugs or a mental disorder. If say the mother passed away in a car crash, there is nothing preventing the father from stepping up to the role as child bearer and being successful at it. </p>
<p>The same would apply to a mother who has a professional role. Just because she took a pregnancy test and it was positive doesn't mean she has to quit her job now while the father "gets off free".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;its why women want a man who can protect </p>
<p>Not all women are interested in dominant males. Women also pick mates based on their likelihood to participate in child rearing, and they do this by observing facial features and making inferences about a man's testosterone (as high testosterone males show less tendency to participate in child rearing).</p>

<p>&rt;you have a feminine view </p>
<p>I wouldn't say I have a feminine view as I'm not a man hater. I'd say I have more of an equal view on genders.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what I think or what you think about genders, our opinions are existent regardless of the rules on the subreddit. However, the rule says users can't discriminate, so in order to abide by the rules, one would have to keep their comments to themselves.</p>

        <p>So blue pilled its hilarious. I'm not trying to come up with solutions for our issues in modern society, but I'm right about everything I said and your source actually proves my point. </p>
<p>And if you think me pointing out some truths is discrimination then you're only proving my point more and more about the feminine view point. You have a blue pilled globohomo controlled view point, embrace it, its what you are</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say the second comment you linked is necessarily sexist, though it was a bit generalist. He said that the mother elected to work over raising her kid full time.</p>
<p>The most egalitarian countries have shown that women do have more of a predisposition to raising children full time more than men, even when you make every effort to reform society to have the sexes be equal in every regard.</p>
<p>The other comments you reference have been removed and/or the users have been banned. So this tells me the admins of this sub don't tolerate such behavior...</p>
<p>That being said I haven't personally seen sexist/racist comments at all during my tenure at this sub. So it's hardly a wretched hive of these things.</p>

        <p>The second comment is certainly sexist because it assumes that it is the mother's responsibility to raise the children, when it is both the mother's and father's (or whatever combination of legal guardians) responsibility. </p>
<p>I like your position about how some women are predisposed to raise their children even in equal societies, it definitely has merit, but it does not apply to this comment because the mother was a doctor, indicating that she made an effort to avoid this predisposition.</p>

<p>&rt;The other comments you reference have been removed and/or the users have been banned. So this tells me the admins of this sub don't tolerate such behavior... </p>
<p>The comments were up for 2 days until I reported them, and then they were removed by moderators.</p>

<p>It's more so that the comments are being upvoted, i.e. the members think they don't have to follow the rules of the subreddit. You can find these comments anywhere, but only in poorly moderated communities do they seem to be upvoted.</p>
