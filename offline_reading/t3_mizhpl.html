    <strong>Mask = The quality / gauge of your character.</strong>
    <p><p>I was in a store that I frequent and never wear a mask. The people there like me and know that I always see them not wearing them until I walk in, so when no one else is there (and it's late) none of us wear them.  </p>
<p>There's one girl I speak to and we get along quite well. She actually exchanged some pretty controversial beliefs with me that I agreed with, I figured she knew this whole thing was not what it seemed to be either. But here's the funny part</p>
<p>One of the guys there told me the next night when she wasn't there "Man, she must really get along well with you. She always gets so pissed when people don't wear masks. It really bothers her, but she never mentions it when you do it".  </p>
<p>I guess the point is this - The beliefs her and I agreed on would make most redditors "REEEE" for and have them "literally shaking" by the end of the conversation. They're normal to people like us here, offensive to others. It's just that all of that content we discussed was negligible and the real gauge of human quality is based off of whether or not I wore a mask...</p>

<p>This is quite ubiquitous too. You can help someone change their tire, pay for their coffee if their card declines, hold the door for them and carry their groceries out to their car.... but none of it matters. The true measure of character is whether or not you submit to the cloth shield or not. It's rather simple why they believe this too - because it's at the highest tier of virtue but also requires the least effort. Win WIN.</p></p>
