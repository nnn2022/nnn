    <strong>What separates us from the Doomers?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m talking about on the most basic, fundamental level.</p>
<p>It isn’t intelligence, there are intelligent people on both sides.</p>
<p>It isn’t education, there are educated people on both sides.</p>
<p>It isn’t race, political leanings, gender, etc.  we run the gamut of those things.</p>
<p>Obviously they are more susceptible to propaganda, but why?  Why can we so easily see through this nonsense while they are so hopelessly entrenched in it?</p>
<p>There has to be some fundamental difference that carries across all social, ideological, cultural, and educational backgrounds.</p>
<p>As someone deeply interested in human psychology I find this subject to be fascinating.</p></p>

        <p>They are oversocialized. Their free will was destroyed while they were children, by a combination of public school indoctrination and mass media propaganda. Their entire life is dominated by their pursuit of social status, and their fear of losing it. To that end, they will NEVER question the authorities, because doing so will lead to them being branded with one of the dreaded taboo labels - "conspiracy theorist".</p>
<p>They would rather die in agony than ever attempt to break their conditioning. They would rather die in agony than ever question their masters. They are, for all intents and purposes, human cattle.</p>

        <p>While I am inclined to agree it begs the question, why?  Why were we spared this fate?</p>
<p>For me personally I moved around the country as a child and thus my conditioning was never consistent/interrupted and I learned to see it for what it was.  But idk about the others.</p>

        <p>It really does seem left to circumstances sometimes. 
Though one could argue a crystallized political divide seems to have left them unable to escape the social reinforcement of Pavlovian conditioning in their camp without destroying what they see as their identity. 
In a sense most, if not all, of the measures the healthy take to fight coronavirus really exist to fight their own guilt, be it as a survivor, or spreader, or just being plain healthy and without worry. The attacks on others are a manifestation of their own guilt, and the victims of their attacks, if they’re successful, will be victims of their own innate guilt, stemming back to childhood.
If any of this is at all valid it would seem to me like the people least susceptible are the people who are hardened against guilt-based manipulation, along with the more basic resistance to fear-mongering.</p>
<p>The Rape of the Mind is an excellent book on Menticide that explains the phenomenon.</p>

        <p>True but weren't we also bombarded with 24/7 propoganda and indocrination?</p>
<p>I do beleive access to the internet was a key difference for the millennial generation to be able to even begin to have access to information during crucial development of reasoning phase. Not that all truth seekers are younger though</p>

        <p>All children question things, at least to start.</p>
<p>Some are told "the answer is because the authority said so!" with the authority being the parent almost all of the time. Eventually this leads them to deeply believe to never question what the authority tells you.</p>
<p>In my family, questioning things was encouraged, and truthful and complete answers were almost always provided to aprox the best ability of my family. My family had one or two hang ups -- nobody is perfect.</p>

        <p>I’ve always been told that I live my life to the beat of my own drum.  I don’t ascribe to one political party or religion.  I also never make a decision based on how others may see me, or on what others are doing.  I can say to people that I’m not getting the shot, here’s why, and feel strongly in my convictions.  I know a lot of people pleasers and those who keep up with the Jones’ and they were the first in line, a few lied in order to get into one of the first waves.  I also question EVERYTHING, to the point I know I can be annoying with it, but when someone says “they said” - it’s always been well, who is they?</p>

        <p>Can only speak for myself on why I’m different...
From a young age of 7 , deceased father , drug addicted mother which put me in a position where I had to grow up fast &amp; I learned to take nothing at face value. I was never indoctrinated to believe that any so called authority figure whether it be government, police, priest , etc. had any power over me. I survived by doing for myself, learning to spot bullshit before I could even  smell it , and always trusting my gut instincts.I survived 40 years &amp; as sad as it is at this age I’ve outlived most of the people I grew up with. I managed to not fall into all the traps that life has to offer simply by seeing it was a trap. I don’t fall for bullshit stories &amp; if someone wants to make me believe something there better be actions matching the words.</p>
<p>TL;DR I have a built in bullshit detector</p>

        <p>I think Orwell said it best:</p>
<p>“Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.”</p>
<p>I am the leader, president, emperor, and supreme ruler of my life... and I found that out by going against the crowd when necessary and rebelling against any system that has tried to subjugate me. I’m strong enough to take on the responsibility because of the personal development/self growth that I have willingly engaged in over the last 15 years while my friends were watching the Kardashians. No one is an authority in my life unless I give them authority. That’s the difference.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure I agree with your premise. I was a doomer until I realized what was going on in January. Some people haven't realized it yet - either they do not pay much attention to the news and what's going on in Aus/EU (if they are American), or their lives haven't been impacted that much so they don't really care. </p>
<p>If I HAD to say there is a difference, I'd say it's trust in government. Doomers believe the government is generally benign. When you wake up you realize the government doesn't actually give a shit about you. But again, this is a realization. It can be learned. It's not inherent.</p>

        <p>Skepticism? For me, I just feel like I look at the messaging and see gaslighting, lies, flip-flopping on messaging, politicians who may have motivation to like for gain, media outlets who may have motivation yo overblow the truth for ratings etc. </p>
<p>I think it’s sketchy af how the public messaging has been brought to the masses during all of this. —but! Apparently the majority buys the media narrative hook, line &amp; sinker. </p>
<p>It absolutely sealed my skepticism once they started censoring and canceling everyone who had questions. “MISINFORMATION!” - “THESE VACCINES ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE!” - if literally anyone posts a simple question about side effects or about questioning anything, really. </p>
<p>Instead of allowing open and honest discussions, they just flag your social media accounts. Throw you in the facebook slammer, ban you from subreddits. — because that is a great way to build community trust. </p>

        <p>&rt; What separates us from the Doomers?</p>
<p>Our quest to be free.</p>
<p>&rt; Obviously they are more susceptible to propaganda, but why?</p>
<p>I am perplexed by this as well. I firmly believe that it all has to do with education and observation. An educated person who understands the idea of liberty, or/and a firm grasp of history, is able to observe the symptoms of tyranny, and is selfish enough to guard their freedom with precious jealously any one would try to take it away. This observation leads us to ask those important but uncomfortable questions that no one else is willing to ask.</p>
<p>&rt; Why can we so easily see through this nonsense while they are so hopelessly entrenched in it?</p>
<p>This took me a while to understand on why we are able to see the scam going on, versus others who are so deeply invested into it. If you have seen the movie, The Matrix, when Morpheus was explaining to Neo that the world is not what it seems, he outright rejected that notion. But why? Because by investing in the illusion that everything is okay, you do as you are told, that we just need to trust that the system, it has your best interest at heart. Doomers believe in this so much that they will defend it to the last man. They will go as far as throw out their own children to defend it. They will as far as to never to talk to their friends, family or any one who threatens their illusion of reality.</p>
<p>Remember Jim Jones from the People's Temple in Guyana? Look at the lengths the people went to keep the illusion of their reality going. They killed their own children, wives, husbands and themselves. There were people that wanted to leave because they knew something was not right, and look at the lengths the members went to keep them in the cult. </p>
<p>When the leaders of this COVID-19 cult come to the realization that they have been found out, do you honestly believe they're just going to lick their wounds and say okay, you caught us? Oh no, these insane people will convince the COVID-19 cult members to drink the Kool-Aid, and take as many people with them as possible.</p>

        <p>From a psychological perspective" Differences in Big 5 personality factors. All humans vary on a scale of 1-100 on 5 personality factors, being extraversion, openness to experience (includes intelligence, creativity, knowledge seeking, experience seeking), neuroticism (proclivity towards anxiety, overthinking etc), agreeableness (includes obedience, liking for rules, going with the status quo, not wanting to stand out) and conscientiousness.</p>
<p>For more info on this, see Costa &amp; McCrae Big 5 theory of personality, or check out many videos on youtube. Jordan Peterson also talks about this. Personally, I feel its easy to see that those higher in openenness and lower in agreeableness, for example, would be more inclined towards questioning things, and vice versa and you've got yourself a classic doomer. </p>
<p>Obviously its far, far more nuanced than this. There must be something to do with authoritarianism in there too but I've not explored this in depth. </p>
<p>From a spiritual point of view: Different soul types on the planet. Some people are on the path of truth and awakening, and not afraid of exploring/ uncovering the shadow side (dark truth) whereas some souls are not ready for that path in this lifetime. </p>

        <p>The best way to describe it is "self-esteem":</p>
<p>Do you believe in your own capacity to analyze and make decisions for yourself, regardless of the opinions of everyone else?</p>
<p>The jabbers fundamentally don't. They are spineless, they conform out of "fear of uncertainty", "love of comfort/security". They are insecure about their own agency.</p>
<p>In contrast, the majority of us, dumb or smart, are willing to put our own beliefs ahead of what is imposed on us by "authorities", even when we know our lives will be made harder because of it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, intelligence is a tool. High IQ means literally NOTHING if you only ever use it to be a better slave. A middling intelligence can, in contrast, be far more precious if it is exercised in the pursuit of a self-determined ideal.</p>
