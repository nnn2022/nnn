        <p>The most intellectually bankrupt thing that ever came from this C19 saga (for me, at least) is the cult-like mantra of "My mask protects you and your mask protects me." I will never fathom how people can actually think/say/write that without any critical thinking.</p>

        <p>It's a lot like <em>regular</em> prison, but with no guards. And it looks too much like your own home.... because it is. Now unless you give us reason to send you to to normal prison, just sit and enjoy this one. Remember to vaccinate your pets, and to spay and neuter your kids!</p>

        <p>What you did is not critical thinking - it was literally accepting the conclusion of an article that was written in Oct 2020. A critical thinker would ask the following question: why were masks not found to be effective in preventing the annual influenza surge since time immemorial, Hong Kong flu pandemic, Asian flu pandemic, SARS-1 pandemic, MERS pandemic, H5N1 and H7N9 bird flus and the H1N1 swine flu pandemic? Every single piece of literature prior to 2020 made it clear that the masks that are worn have no impact on the progression of a respiratory pathogen. What changed in 2020?</p>

<p>There simply isn't much research. A lot of it is also because of cultural opposition to wearing masks. In Asia there is more usage.</p>

<p>&rt; Hand hygiene and facemasks <strong><em>seemed to prevent household transmission of influenza virus when implemented within 36 hours of index patient symptom onset.</em></strong> </p>
<p>In the West, when people have cold and flu symptoms, they simply stay at home. Asians typically go to work whilst sick, hence the use of masks. Also note that masks are used with SYMPTOMATIC cases.</p>

        <p>So I just got done looking at whatever studies and journals published over the years I could find and this is what I found. Considering masks ability to prevent the inhalation of viruses through aerosols, I found <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/153567601001500204#:~:text=Each%20face%20mask%20was%20challenged%20for%2030%20minutes.&amp;text=The%20protective%20efficiencies%20were%2033.3,the%20three%20face%20masks%20tested.">this</a> suggesting a respirator, like an n95, is really the only way to absolutely minimize that, while surgical masks are only okay at it. So in that regard, for sure masks aren't extremely effective, but still better than nothing. But onto the real stuff: any type of facial covering is gonna prevent respiratory droplets from getting out and landing on people. That's just a fact. Same concept as coughing into your hand. In that regard, masks do help prevent the spread of all those viruses, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/masks.htm#.">here's</a> the CDC's information regarding the H1N1 flu, and you'll see they recommend the infected wear masks. Reaffirming the "I protect you, you protect me" mantra, which is particularly important for all of us now, considering <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=010721">59% of covid transmissions are from asymptomatic people.</a> If I'm not mistaken, most, if not all of the viruses you listed, are spread the same way as covid-19, which is mainly through those respiratory droplets, bar skin contact. If those can't get out, nobody gets it on/in them. If they get out and I'm wearing a mask, less facial surface area for it to land on. And again, the same concept is applied to all the viruses you listed. So yes, if someone with SARS is in the same room as you and they're wearing a mask, you can feel more comfortable than if they weren't. Please let me know if I'm mistaken about anything.</p>

<p>I really wish that people read the articles they linked. Did you read the ABSTRACT? It literally says, "<strong><em>Each face mask was challenged for 30 minutes</em></strong>." Do you, or anyone else you know, change their N95 mask every 30 min?  </p>
<p>&rt;Same concept as coughing into your hand.</p>
<p>Yes, because you're constantly coughing into your hand 8+ hours a day, right? This is why you believe that your example is a valid one.  </p>
<p>&rt;In that regard, masks do help prevent the spread of all those viruses, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/masks.htm#.">here's</a> the CDC's information regarding the H1N1 flu, and you'll see they recommend the infected wear masks.</p>
<p>CRINGE!</p>
<p>This is what the link that you shared actually says: (Notice how it omits masks?)</p>
<p><strong>In areas with confirmed human cases of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus infection, the risk for infection can be reduced through a combination of actions. No single action will provide complete protection, but an approach combining the following steps can help decrease the likelihood of transmission. These recommended actions are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wash hands frequently with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub</strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/qa.htm#antibacterial"><strong>*</strong></a></li>
<li><strong>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth</strong></li>
<li><strong>People who are sick with an influenza-like illness (ILI) (fever plus at least cough or sore throat and possibly other symptoms like runny nose, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea) should stay home and keep away from others as much as possible, including avoiding travel, for at least 24 hours after fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. (Fever should be gone without the use of fever-reducing medicine).</strong>Â </li>
<li><strong>Avoid close contact (i.e. being within about 6 feet) with persons with ILI.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What does it ACTUALLY say about masks???</p>
<h2>Facemasks and Respirators</h2>
<p><strong>Recommendations for the uses of facemasks and/or respirators are listed in</strong> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/masks.htm#table1"><strong>Table 1</strong></a> <strong>below for different settings where a person may be exposed to 2009 H1N1 virus. These recommendations also differ based on whether the person exposed to 2009 H1N1 is in a group at increased risk for severe illness from influenza infection. More information on preventing influenza transmission in health care settings can be found in the</strong> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/guidelines_infection_control.htm"><strong>Interim Guidance for Infection Control for Care of Patients with Confirmed or Suspected 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection in a Healthcare Setting</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In community and home settings, the use of facemasks and respirators generally are not recommended.Â  However, for certain circumstances as described in</strong> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/masks.htm#table1"><strong>Table 1</strong></a><strong>, a facemask or respirator may be considered, specifically for persons at increased risk of severe illness from influenza.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use of N95 respirators or facemasks generally is not recommended for workers in non-healthcare occupational settings for general work activities.Â  For specific work activities that involve contact with people who have ILI, such as escorting a person with ILI, interviewing a person with ILI, providing assistance to an individual with ILI, the following are recommended:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>workers should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet or more from the person with ILI;</strong></li>
<li><strong>workers should keep their interactions with ill persons as brief as possible;</strong></li>
<li><strong>the ill person should be asked to follow good cough etiquette and hand hygiene and to wear a facemask, if able, and one is available;</strong></li>
<li><strong>workers at increased risk of severe illness from influenza infection (see footnote 3 of</strong> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/masks.htm#table1"><strong>table 1</strong></a><strong>) should avoid people with ILI (possibly by temporary reassignment); and,</strong></li>
<li><strong>where workers cannot avoid close contact with persons with ILI, some workers may choose to wear a facemask or N95 respirator on a voluntary basis.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the occupational healthcare setting, respiratory protection is recommended.Â  Because infection control precautions, including respiratory protection, are imperfect, workers who are at increased risk of severe illness from influenza, and who are caring for a patient with known, probable, or suspected 2009 H1N1 or ILI, may consider temporary reassignment to avoid exposure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional recommendations for use of facemasks by people who have ILI that may be due to 2009 H1N1 infection are included in</strong> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/masks.htm#table2"><strong>Table 2</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are important differences between facemasks and respirators. Facemasks do not seal tightly to the face and are used to block large droplets from coming into contact with the wearerâ€™s mouth or nose. Most respirators (e.g. N95) are designed to seal tightly to the wearerâ€™s face and filter out very small particles that can be breathed in by the user. For both facemasks and respirators, however, limited data is available on their effectiveness in preventing transmission of H1N1 (or seasonal influenza) in various settings. However, the use of a facemask or respirator is likely to be of most benefit if used as early as possible when exposed to an ill person and when the facemask or respirator is used consistently. (Ref. 1. MacIntyre CR, et al. EID 2009;15:233-41. 2. Cowling BJ, et al. Non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent household transmission of influenza. The 8th Asia Pacific Congress of Medical Virology, Hong Kong, 26-28 February 2009.)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Translation: Those who are at severe risk and display influenza SYMPTOMS should be the ones CONSIDERING masks etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Reaffirming the "I protect you, you protect me" mantra, which is particularly important for all of us now, considering <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=010721">59% of covid transmissions are from asymptomatic people.</a> If I'm not mistaken, most, if not all of the viruses you listed, are spread the same way as covid-19, which is mainly through those respiratory droplets, bar skin contact.</p>
<p>You literally just came from linking CDC reports (which you never read past the title) showing mask guidance for people <strong><em>WITH H1N1 SYMPTOMS</em></strong> and you're back to talking about masks for AsYmPtOmAtIc cases. If you want to be intellectually dishonest, put some work into it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If I'm not mistaken, most, if not all of the viruses you listed, are spread the same way as covid-19, which is mainly through those respiratory droplets, bar skin contact. If those can't get out, nobody gets it on/in them. If they get out and I'm wearing a mask, less facial surface area for it to land on.</p>
<p>Didn't you just give me 'sneeze into one's hands' example just now? Did humans suddenly forget to do something so basic when C19 rolled through town in 2020?</p>

        <p>Okay, so you say my study of 30 minutes with different masks isn't good enough, so show me one that goes on for longer and comes to a different conclusion. Next, I don't think I understand your problem with my coughing into your hand analogy. Are you saying it'd get less efficient as time goes on? Because yea, that's true of masks. That's why we use new masks, or wash cloth masks, when old ones get soiled. Then you say my link omits information about masks, then just say exactly what it says about masks in the next paragraph, including "the ill person should be asked to follow good cough etiquette and hand hygiene and to <strong>wear a facemask</strong>, if able, and one is available;" Which, I'm sorry if I've been unclear, but this has been my stance from the start. Sick people should be wearing masks. I think we're on the same page there. There is limited evidence suggesting wearing a facemask helps stop inhalation of an aerosoled virus to a great degree, it's just better than nothing. (Though keep in mind, different viruses are spread differently, so the efficacy varies.) And at worst just stops the respiratory droplets from landing on your face, which is much better than nothing. So for sure it's more about source control, not letting the virus out of someone. So why are masks so much more important now? Like I previously mentioned, most people spreading covid-19 are asymptomatic. Which means without symptoms. Not hacking up a lung and running a fever. It doesn't mean someone isn't sick, and isn't carrying the virus. So if we can't tell who has it, how are we supposed to stop it from spreading, other than to have everyone mask up? So yea, I'm not being "intellectually dishonest," other viruses are just much easier to tell if someone has it, hence only the people showing symptoms absolutely <em>need</em> the masks. Though, again, from the same cdc report, "Use of a facemask or respirator is likely to be of most benefit if used correctly and consistently when exposed to an ill person." If you don't know who's ill, how do you know who to wear a mask around? Lastly, since when has the advice been, "as long as you cough into your hand, you'll be fine"? There are many preventative measures we take with every illness, including social distancing, washing our hands, coughing and sneezing into our hands and elbows, etc. This is just another measure. And if you're gonna call anything out, show me some evidence of why I'm wrong.</p>

        <p>The virus lives in bodily fluids. Bodily fluids can either be droplets, which are larger and heavier, or aerosols which are smaller and lighter. Aerosols can travel in the air, but they are smaller and so likely carry less virus. Droplets are larger, cannot travel as far, but carry more virus. </p>

        <p>I've never needed to wear a mask because in my country (Australia) the government knows how to respond to a pandemic, and my fellow citizens have been diligent in their lockdowns, social isolation, testing and tracing, and mask use when and where there were outbreaks. There was never more than 50 infections in my state at the absolute peak, though other more connected and populous states had a harder time.</p>
<p>If I were to dispose of my mask, I would grasp it via the straps and put it into a lined bin. The virus doesn't effervesce off the mask so if no one touches it it's fine.</p>

        <p>The actual numbers you should be looking at are occupancy rates of beds in hospitals, covid might not kill but if not contained, the hospital fill up and people who need other types of treatments will not have access to correct care and will die. Educate yourself buddy</p>

        <p>In my country, the hospitals are overwhelmed every flu season, going back as long as I can remember. It's a talking point in our media that can be compared to Brexit in how much they go on about it and how little positive ever gets done about it. The occupancy rate this flu season was DOWN on previous years. During a global pandemic!!1! Go figure.</p>

        <p>It has more to do with the fact there is no pandemic. Nothing out of the ordinary has happened over the last year except for all the people brainwashed by the constant propaganda.</p>
<p>We had lots of lockdowns and lots of extensions on lockdowns. We are still in a lockdown that's been extended for the second or third time, I don't even know anymore as I have tuned out completely at this point. The majority wear masks but like everywhere there are plenty who don't. It had no bearing on anything at all. The pandemic is fake, you're being lied to.</p>

<p>Droplets generally won't. Aerosols do. However, aerosols carry much smaller amounts of virus because they're smaller, so you'd need to be exposed to a lot more of them to catch COVID. This only happens in COVID wards where they have lots of COVID patients or in ICUs where mechanical ventilation creates aerosols. In day to day interaction, droplets are the much bigger concern. Which generally occurs speaking to one another mask less and essentially spitting on one another. </p>

<p>What kind of "mask" are you wearing that has a big hole where you're mouth is? That's not a mask.</p>

        <p>While i hate to link a yt vid i stumbled across this while typing a response. He is much more of an authority on the subject doing his residency at stanford medical, as well as his sources are directly linked do you can fact check what he says rather then beg for sources from a random internet user. I encourage you to watch the whole video he explains why what you said </p>
<p>&rt;However, aerosols carry much smaller amounts of virus because they're smaller, so you'd need to be exposed to a lot more of them to catch COVID. </p>
<p>Is not only false but blatant disinformation. </p>
<p>He then talks about why we need the vaccine because he isnt some random conspiracy nut. He is pro vaccine, and has changing stances on other covid related subjects as he is willing to humble himself say he was wrong and then follow science. </p>
<p>He also addresses the mask issue and what i mean by holes.</p>
