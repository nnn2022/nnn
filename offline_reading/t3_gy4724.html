        <p>Way back at the beginning of this, in fact I think it was a day or two before my workplace closed due to the coronavirus, I had this conversation with a client. Her husband knows a lot of people at the CDC, apparently, and it was his opinion that money was the driving force.</p>
<p>At that time I was all hyped up and believing the bs and thinking we were all going to die, so I was very offended. LOL</p>
<p>Oh, the good old days...</p>

        <p>Well, initially it was that I had been waiting for and fully expecting to see our hospitals overwhelmed, and to see people get sick and know people who were getting sick. I was waiting for a big-time supply chain breakdown. All of these things. One day in early April, after seeing that literally non one around me was sick, and hearing that our hospitals were at 50% capacity, I started to ask myself what was going on. It just steamrolled from there. I found alternative sources who were saying something other than the MSM.</p>

        <p>Of course it's a psyop. Marketing by definition is the "war on the mind". And news is full of marketing.  Not rocket science.  </p>
<p>This concept is avoided because we have clowns in the media accusing people capable of critical thinking of being "conspiracy theorists"</p>

        <p>"The people and agencies driving the coronavirus scare have a history of unethical behaviors, including hyping pandemics to push vaccines, and appear to seek long-term profits through implementation of a highly controlled society. Therefore, the response to COVID-19, if not the virus itself, can be seen as a psychological operation used to drive those outcomes."</p>

        <p>In my opinion, behavioural modification is better suited to fit the situation being forced upon us. They seem to be targeting children and teens as well through schooling changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/comparatively-speaking/201810/understanding-what-makes-behavior-modification-work">https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/comparatively-speaking/201810/understanding-what-makes-behavior-modification-work</a> </p>
<p>One major factor that often gets missed with behaviour modification is change. Behavioural programs are not supposed to remain the same. When you find one type of approach that works, you’re supposed to keep it in place for a little while, but then change the program. If you have one program that works but you just keep the same, it isn’t likely to stay effective. </p>

        <p>Oh the fields of psychology and its more odious big brother.... psychiatry. This is a topic I have been neck deep in investigating for well over a year when corona virus kicked off. Where does one begin? </p>
<p>Within the context of this thread, I will mention just the general acceptance of "personality disorders." A concept which is based on exactly no science what-so-ever, but anyone not perpetually petrified - or who has already accepted their inevitable death and mortality - is labelled as someone who engages in "risky behaviour." Historically, the risk-takers among us were considered extremely valuable to the future of our species.... the sort that made bold new discoveries and would be considered heroes. These traits are now frowned upon and have been replaced by our individualistic drive towards selfishness, our obsession with "boundaries" and labeling anyone who disagrees with us or challenges us as "toxic," and so on. Now the risk takers, the ones who will not comply simply because it's what we are expected to do in the role of "patient," and who ultimately are completely stifled in a suffocating safety-obsessed world get useless "personality disorder" labels. In other words.... "this person refuses to comply with our insane way of living... they must be defective and crazy." </p>
<p>This is a major can of worms (don't even get me started on the complete bullshit that is CBT), but if the subject of how we have been systematically "worked on" by an industry working a political agenda interests you, I recommend the book Mad in America by  Robert Whitaker.</p>

        <p>Very interesting, I need to read up on this stuff.</p>
<p>I'm feeling like this risk-hate is so alien to Americans. We like to take a good risk - it's in the  blood.</p>

        <p>Hey OP- Thanks for this post! I am always looking for fresh and open minded media sources -now than ever as mainstream media is owned by the same handful of companies and they all spew an incessant cesspool of bias, propaganda, and inaccuracies. Never heard of Off Guardian. Thanks.</p>

        <p>Definitely. I have been teaching for 20 years, and in that time, I have had a few crisis moments in the classroom. As the "leader" of the group, the last thing I would ever want to do in a potentially harmful situation is terrorize my students by pumping them full of fear and dread. We all just got endlessly pounded with messages of terror and hysteria for week after week. No real leader would ever do that in an actual crisis. They were selling it so hard.</p>
