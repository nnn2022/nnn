    <strong>What’s up awesome people, can anyone help a freshmen in college out??</strong>
    <p><p>So in my Community Policing/Relations class I have to write a response to an act of terrorism. Obviously I’m going to write about the BLM terrorist. So I need to know all I can about George Floyd. It’s impossible to find stuff about him when searching for it on google. </p>
<p>Here are the things I would like to know:</p>
<p>Did George Floyd have a warrant out for his arrest on May 26?</p>
<p>What was the <em>real</em> autopsy report on Floyd’s death?</p>
<p>Finally I would like to know George Floyd’s criminal background. Again, it’s impossible to find stuff like that when searching for it on google. </p>
<p>Any help and any extra knowledge about how the BLM terrorism acts have started would be much appreciated.</p></p>
