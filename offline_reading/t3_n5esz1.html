    <strong>Selective Critical Thinking...</strong>
    <p><p>Have you eve noticed, that whenever a study comes out that suggests vaccines might not be as good as advertised, the pro-vaccine people become the worlds best critical thinkers, and thru their own 5 minute, self-directed peer-review, they can easily spot any and every mistake in that study...</p>
<p>But, those exact same people, are utterly incapable of finding any problems whatsoever in any study that shows vaccines are good, even if that study is an admitted fraud!</p>
<p>They will literally do an about-face, and <em>defend</em> the fraud, and <em>deny</em> that any fraud occurred...</p>
<p>And then, they act surprised when you don't "trust their science"</p>

        <p>Truth vs. Narrative has always been a problem, it's not new. In very few and far between instances will you find a researcher who isn't funded by someone with a goal in mind. That alone is antithetical to the scientific method. You don't go in with a goal, you go in with a hypothesis and present ALL of the data. Researchers who cherry-pick and manipulate data are tools of their employer.</p>
