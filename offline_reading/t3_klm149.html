    <strong>COVID Isn't Even Top 10 On the Most Important List</strong>
    <p><p>According to basic standards of reason and morality, COVID isn't even top 10 on the list of most important problems facing humanity, let alone so important that we need to reorganize global society around it.  In a world governed by reason, 99.9% of the population wouldn't even know what COVID is because it is so unimportant in the grand scheme of things.  Just off the top of my head, I can think of numerous problems that are WAY more important than COVID.  In no particular order: Wars, famine, heart disease, cancer, obesity, suicide, drug addiction and overdose, iatrogenic deaths.  The list goes on and on.  Idiotic doomers always fixate on the top-line "COVID death" count because it sounds so big when viewed in isolation.  But when you actually view those "COVID deaths" in terms of quality years of life lost, you quickly realize that most of these so-called "COVID deaths" are just old people dying naturally.  In terms of tragedy, one teenage suicide or drug overdose is like a million times more tragic than an 85-year-old dying from an infection.  One child starving in the third world is probably a billion times more tragic than an 85-year-old dying from infection.  The importance attached to COVID by doomers is actually insane.</p></p>
