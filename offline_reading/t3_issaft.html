        <p>We're closing everything and implementing security theater for a cold bug. Every human experience prior to 2020 is now forbidden or completely neutered. Obviously that rubs a lot of people the wrong way.</p>

        <p>My 12 year old is sitting in a room doing school on zoom. He hasn't played sports in 6 months and though little league practice just started there are no games and there are ridiculous "social distancing" rules in place. We can't go to a baseball game to watch our favorite team doing well. We can't go to the movies. Some parents won't let their kids out of the house. My daughter is in college practically locked in a dorm room instead of getting to play her club sport, be part of volunteer groups or go to parties and have fun like a 19 year old should be doing. I can't exercise outside because of smoke in my area, yet gyms are still closed. Pools closed even with a recent 100 degree heatwave. Fences around playgrounds so little kids can't play. People wear masks while walking alone (and some want everyone else to do the same.)</p>
<p>None of this is OK to me for a virus that has a 99+% survival rate for all but the very elderly or sick. You think your "new normal" isn't bad? Fine, lock yourself inside forever and let the rest of us go back to the old normal.</p>

        <p>They've never cured a virus.  Vaccines aren't 100 percent effective. Even the flu shot is hit or miss. So they can just push those goalposts back for years, even decades... and we're supposed to be okay with that?  Remember, we shut down the country for 15 days. How long has it been?</p>

        <p>"If" is the key word you are missing. Why are you so confident that a cure/vaccine will be developed? And what kind of time frame do you think is acceptable? What if a vaccine is never developed? What if it is ridiculously expensive to produce? What if it is not very effective?</p>

        <p>I have no idea. Back in March it was a few weeks to "flatten the curve" to protect the hospitals. Somehow it became "until there is a vaccine" (which could never happen) or "until a certain percentage of the population is vaccinated" (also might never get there) or "until no one ever gets Covid again" or "until we cure death". In California we don't even have a "green" stage for businesses opening - there is NO scenario where our governor will allow full business openings, large events etc. And the plan he has now (the fourth one he's come up with) is virtually impossible to meet - false positive tests alone will keep most counties out of the least restrictive tier forever.</p>
<p>So fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... yeah, not going along with whatever the new plan is.</p>

        <p>I had a life worth living before this. I had dreams to aspire to. I had the freedom to just exist and be seen as a person and not a disease vector. When people got sick, they didn’t blame other’s morality on it. Kids are being treated like prisoners and their futures are being written off as unnecessary. Trying to find joy or plan anything fun now makes you an awful person. Life is no longer worth living. There was more to life than simply having a beating heart and being upright and now there isn’t.

<p>plus women had the right to be equal, contributing members of society and free full citizens before the law - now, we can either be a mommy and stay home full-time with the kids (because we can't send the children to school or day care now can we) or we can work. you cannot have both, you cannot do it all, and you may not chose. the virus chose for you. what the fuck.</p>
<p>what happened to "my body, my choice," whether it's an abortion (go for it) or a face mask (again, make your own choices) or a vaccine for a virus that might be at best 40-50% effective?</p>
<p>what happened to the idea of death with dignity?</p>
