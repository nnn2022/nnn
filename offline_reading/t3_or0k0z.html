    <strong>The power of persuasion ( vaccine taking) news media and everything in between</strong>
    <p><p>Let me introduce you to a form of psychology where your like selling something that sounds awesome and great. A bit like when you join a new gym the price the setting and all the jargon to get you to sign up and than you sign up..and than you tell that friend how great it is.. and they join..  </p>
<p>You still with me ? </p>
<p>Its how twitter works too if your following a certain subject. And you know there is always one or many for arguments sake who will not agree..but you have like group against you. Works in a similar way </p>
<p>Take for instants you ever run across a traffic light without pushing the actually button ? And the person waiting with you will do the same. And follow and do. </p>
<p>And your see that in many situations and settings.</p>
<p>Say like you want to do vodka shots. There is bound to be someone who will go ok than ( be that peer pressure or to look cool ) they have to do it. I see it i do.  </p>
<p>Are you getting a pattern here yet ? </p>
<p>If you ever notice your in a setting like this. I want you do something and see if that person will follow and do ( don't make to extreme). If they do it. It shows how easily led they are. </p>
<p>Getting to the case and point.  </p>
<p>This is the same with the vaccinated people whom had have them.  Not all of them obviously ( I've seen ones that have got our back and agree with us ) </p>
<p>The other vaccinated folk , its like they have come together. Like they have all been stood at the traffic lights and all not pushed the button and they have all followed one after the other. And when one says and do they. All follow and do. </p>
<p>Power of persuasion in psychology can be good thing. But when its used in government and media etc it can become very dangerous and toxic and used the wrong way. Like we have seen. </p>
<p>Look out for one another. </p>
<p>And take care ðŸ–¤</p>
<p>P.s sorry it was so long winded</p>
<p>I like to explain fully</p></p>
