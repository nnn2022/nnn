    <strong>We're never getting out of this</strong>
    <p><p>Where are all you people who can see what is going on?  Where are you all hiding?  I can't see any way out.  I am never going to he able to be independent again, now we are all permanent children of big daddy government.  I am never going to be able to grow up and see the world.  I am never going to be able to meet new people again.  I have no friends.  I have no family.  Because no one wants to hear me, or if they do, its only so they can publicly shame me.  I don't have any children, so I don't have anything dependent on me alone that I need to live for.  I don't think I should.  What is the point?</p></p>

        <p>We need to stop waiting for them to "let us out" and we need to do it our self's, You are right if we wait for them to "let us out" we will never get out, Good news though we dont need to convince everyone we only need 3.5%, if we can get 3.5% of the population to stand up and say "no more", this shit ends as fast as it started.</p>

        <p>There is already 3.5% in support. That's for sure. Problem now is to get people organized and active. Gotta figure out ways to make that happen.</p>

        <p>Yes. Definitely it's a major problem. The only way that any protest seems to get organized is through Facebook. But are there really so many people on the right who both use Facebook and are comfortable to have their real identity linked to a lockdown protest?</p>
<p>It's funny that they don't ban organization of anti-lockdown protests altogether (back in spring they said that they would). But maybe that's the reason, it's controlled opposition that they know won't be very effective anyway. </p>
<p>How did people manage to organize this kind  of think before the internet? Seems like it shouldn't be such an impossible thing but nobody seems to know how. Or maybe it's just impossible now to get the word out about anything now that everybody has their heads buried in their phones.</p>

        <p>i’m a server and recently i’ve been talking to my tables on all the ridiculous measures being taken (like the fact that we’re at 25% capacity) and based on their reaction i gauge if they’re anti or pro lockdown and so far the ones i’ve talked to have been anti but i wouldn’t have known unless i had that conversation with them. </p>
<p>i’m thinking about creating an email and printing out business cards to hand out to those that share my same views so that i can build a group to ultimately protest in the city and at the mayors office.</p>

        <p>i totally agree. whenever i serve any tables i assume they’re not pro lockdown since they’re dining out but i’ve had tables makes comments that prove otherwise. they just think it applies to everyone else. and i’ve had tables that keep they’re mask on except to take bites of food and take sips of their drink. it’s really silly and i think i make it obvious with my reaction to them but idc.</p>

        <p>It's very frustrating isn't it? How even the people on our side don't really seem to want to do anything? Weakness of the current culture maybe? I don't know. I've noticed in the past 10 years or so that people have become far more insular than they were before. Only look out for themselves, aren't interested in people or things outside the bubble they already have. </p>
<p>I've been keeping myself busy with a few activism projects. Just not gaining much traction because I can hardly get anybody else to help out. Oh well. I will plug away, at least it will keep me of sane mind and clear conscience.</p>

        <p>It’s really hard to organize against this. A woman in Australia was arrested for posted on Facebook about a protest. Social media isn’t a good avenue. </p>
<p>The old way of posting flyers is ineffective because nobody will see them. Fewer people are walking around</p>

        <p>Weill, that's exactly what I'm working to try and solve. I've got two ideas: one is to adopt some worn symbol en-masse. Works on many of the same principles as the mask psyop but in reverse and once you have a critical mass of people no more need to use social media to spread the word (but you do need it to kick things off). Second is a simple lockdown protest planner + encrypted messaging website, which I'm working on the code for now. Just to make it easy and quick to plan protests and also to do it anonymously. </p>
<p>Don't really expect it to go anywhere, especially since I'm the only one working on this now. But keeps me sane at least like I said.</p>

I only skimmed the article and later wanted to find it. I never could. It had something about choosing a color as a significant symbol.</p>

        <p>you see the interesting thing is you never were independent. you were just as owned before as you are now, you just didnt realise it. very little has changed, but the illusion of the world you used to live in has been modified. a closer to home reality is here, and your world view has changed, the reality however has hardly changed at all.</p>

        <p>my advice is to stay social at a grass roots level. organise gatherings with like minded people in your area. we're basically at war so we have to think and plan like the resistance used to.</p>
<p>I've just made friends with a guy who puts on little gatherings every week, playing a bit of music outdoors through small speakers. It's done my mental health so much good, just dancing around and smiling a bit.</p>

        <p>The only way out that I can see is to stop being a pushover.  Stop compromising.  I've cut out friends and family from my life forever.  I don't have time for them.  I won't socialize with them.  I have walked away from them and as far as I am concerned, they don't exist.  That's what we have to do.  Just leave them to wallow in their misery and loneliness.  Go get the jobs you can and find friends who still have common sense.  If you have a doomer in your life, the BIGGEST statement you can possibly make is to just completely ghost them from your life.  It takes away all of their imagined power.   Either they will come to their senses and rejoin you in the real world or they will drown in their own fear.  They are not your problem.</p>

        <p>THIS. I totally agree with this. People need to stop pandering to others' neurosis. Today someone cancelled on a walk outside. Apparently 'double-booked'. Hmmm. Ok. I'm not convinced. I think she's scared. She talks a good game but the reality is she is a bit lame, unwilling to follow through. I want NOTHING to do with those who don't follow through anymore. If you are still scared at this point and are healthy and young then it's kind of lame. I get it's their choice and I respect that. But not for me so BYEEEEE</p>

        <p>I was very pessimistic for a long time, but I'm starting to think we have a way out of this soon. More people are pushing against their governors in most states (not mine, unfortunately).</p>
