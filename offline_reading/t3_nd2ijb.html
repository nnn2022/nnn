    <strong>If they had just let us focus on our health there wouldn't be so many people dead</strong>
    <p><p>We know that the more conditions people have the more likely Covid19 would be harmful if not fatal. When I see the 500,000 number of people who "died due to Covid19" I am always wondering what health problems did that person have already?   </p>
<p>Smoking, Drinking, Obesity, Drugs, etc. are things that most of us are addicted to. For example I drink and dealing with Obesity, but I was able to recover from Covid19 just fine. Sure I was sick for a week or two, but I bounced back. Would it have been a different story if I Drank more than I do now (which is maybe only 2-3 drinks when I do drink) So that makes me wonder how many conditions did those 500,000 people have already?   </p>
<p>All of these restrictions and fear is what caused so many people to lose their lives. More people stopped working out to improve their overall health and immune system. People were to afraid to have a normal interaction with someone which caused people to stay home, have panic attacks if people got close to them, raise their blood pressure whenever the news showed how many people "were dying due to Covid". Instead of going to a doctor to see if you should get the vaccine people instead booked appointments the first chance they got. People wore masks in hot weather. People got more stressed due to the pandemic. People that lost their jobs due to the pandemic had an increase of stress, drugs and or alcohol. There were increases in abuse either with self-harm or being abused by others.   </p>
<p>During one of the most stressful pandemics people had to deal with there was nothing people could do to decrease their stress. Gyms were either shut down or restricted, Weather outside at least for the North and North East made it hard for people to enjoy the outdoors. I am sure even in the hot states people stay in because it's to hot outside. In fact staying in your homes was encouraged! You were doing your "patriotic duty". You were "doing the right thing" for staying at home to "protect someone else".   </p>
<p>Tldr: There were many other factors that caused more than 500,000 people to die. Not just because of Covid19 alone.</p></p>

        <p>They didn't. In New York, ALL the cases going to the nursing homes had to be out of the two week period when people were believed to be contagious at absolute most.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Here it is straight from the cdc. This is widely ignored. 500k people have not died due to covid 19.</p>

        <p>The issue is that those 'other factors' have for over 40 years been mild "You should live until 80!" factors.</p>
<p>HBP, obesity, etc.</p>
<p>The problem with CoVid is that it seems to like to say "You have these conditions... you get seriously sick or die now! NOMP!" and eats people with those conditions in a way that has never been seen before CoVid.</p>
<p>Even the deaths in the elderly in nursing homes with Alzheimer's/Dementia were strangely high.</p>
<p>That could have been however to do lack of proper care and the whole "Trump supports this treatment... no one can get it!" that the CDC and FDA were trying to do.</p>
