    <strong>Remember the days we used to be free.</strong>
    <p><p>People. Remember the days we used to be free. We used to go to concerts of our favorite band and singer. We went to ball game on a Sunday afternoon or watched it on TV. We hung out at the mall with our friends as teens. We had family outings and road trips. We went on a cruise when we could save up for one. We had skateboarding places to go to? Remember fun?</p>
<p>Well do you also remember learning about the Soviet Union and the Iron Curtain? Those poor people had NOTHING to live for..... just wake up go to work (for pennies) and came home and repeated that till the day each died. Well guess what friends, that is here now. Game over.</p>
<p>Time to focus on your salvation of your soul. Please seek salvation in Jesus Christ. There is hardly any time left. Please save yourselves from God's coming wrath. Confess your sins, confess that Jesus was crucified for your sins, and risen on the third day and seated at the right hand of GOD the Father!  We are living according to the book of Revelation. The George Orwell novels 1984 and Animal Farm are prophetic as is the prophecies of Nostradamus. Between the 3 it is assumed to be spot on with the events that led to this day. </p>
<p>Do NOT receive the mark of the beast nor follow it. Follow Christ only and you will live in eternity in heaven!! If your family or friends will heed the warnings that is good. If not just make sure that YOU are saved. It is unfortunate that your friend, parent, or sibling may not believe you but if you try to convince them then great. </p>
<p>Jesus is KING!!!</p></p>

        <p>Sorry but I am not trading one society-gripping cult for another, a lot of the problems I see with New Normalism are what I see with organized religion, the parallels are almost uncanny.</p>
