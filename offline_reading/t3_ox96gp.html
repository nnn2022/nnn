        <p>Rural areas have all but stopped caring because they aren't reminded 24/7 in real life. Add to the fact most of these places are pretty conservative and realize that the news is all propaganda, you have a formula for ending the pandemic. It's almost as if it goes away if you just ignore it.. strange.</p>

        <p>4 million people have died in record of Covid- each having a family, aspirations... a life</p>
<p>With a case fatality rate of up to 10% in countries with poor health care (usually in the global south), we would be seeing almost four times as many deaths and no end in sight</p>
<p>Remember that there are many things making the pandemic less bad than it already is, and even despite that it's already taken 4 million lives</p>
<p>I hope everyone can agree how tragic that is. What if one of those 4 million were your father? Your mother? Your best friend? Even just the lovely lady down the road...</p>
<p>Then you'd know about it. Then you wouldn't need it shoved down your throat.</p>
<p>Have your own takes, but at least acknowledge that many people have died, and many, many more would have died without at least some health measures (including just handwashing; having hospitals)</p>
<p>We would know about it. We do know about it.</p>

        <p>That's correct! Even still some number of people have died, which I would hope we can agree on being a bad thing. That type of reporting is meant to include other means of death that were exacerbated by covid; also a tragic thing</p>
<p>Generally, it's safe to say that it is notable when any amount of people die whether it is shared in media or not- like I said the people dying are real people</p>

        <p>The average death age is higher than the life expectancy, this used to just be considered natural causes. I agree with your overall assessment of 'people dying is bad' but that is an extremely basic take that obviously most people agree with. Does people dying warrant everyone else sacrificing years of their life so that maybe some people past the life expectancy will live longer? Thats the question.</p>

        <p>So you'd all rather a 75 year old person who may have lived until 80 die than wear a mask, social distance, and get a vaccine?</p>
<p>I really want to understand the other side but I cannot fathom that logic... that 75 year old is a real human. You just don't care about that?</p>
<p>I don't want to be offensive to you or anyone in this sub (although I clearly failed). I'm just trying to understand how making a sacrifice for others is so incomprehensible to all of you- is it that you value a compromise to years of your youth over a few years of life for an elder or immunocompromised person? Or that you don't believe/trust health professionals? Or you just don't care about it all?</p>
<p>I have family and friends who are at increased risk- why should they have to live knowing that we won't ever reach herd immunity (although we might in actuality; we wouldn't following the ideology of this sub). That other people don't care about their right to live as regular a life as possible; should they be the ones who have to sacrifice their lives?</p>
<p>By the way, thanks for actually helping me understand instead of just downvoting like everyone else here. I understand we won't agree but I want to at least hear someone's logic</p>
<p>The whole reason I made the comment is because I thought at least we could agree that people dying was enough for us to care and cause concern. I honestly find the meme incredibly dismissive of all of the pain and suffering caused by the disease- many other posts in this sub are totally reasonable and I'm just trying to learn. I must say that the downvote spam is really off-putting though; I worry that such a culture is only going to create (if it hasn't already) a weird radical circle-jerk where challenging opinions are thrown away immediately</p>

        <p>Yea I don't downvote I think its pointless, for me the idea isn't that I don't care about the 75 year old, its that the 75 year old likely doesn't care how long they have left and just want to spend time with their family not be left to die in a nursing home because of restrictions. I am interested in whats best for people, even if it is counter to the narrative. </p>
<p>It isn't that I wouldn't sacrifice for others its that the sacrifices aren't effective and don't actually help the situation. Masks and vaccines have already been proven to be ineffective, covid is here now we just have to learn to live with it. Instead of pushing masks, vaccines and crippling lockdowns, I would trust the officials a LOT more of they stressed exercise, healthy eating, and getting natural vitamin D in the sunlight. Obesity and vitamin D, besides age, are the biggest predictors of if you will die from covid. Instead it is pushed that I should violate my bodily autonomy, i.e. get a shot that is experimental for a disease I am 99.999% likely to survive and have survived. (Natural immunity being dismissed to push the shot is a whole other problem and argument.) In order to protect people who refuse to make healthy choices. It is a logical fallacy with an emotional appeal that is not aimed at stopping the virus. Instead officials are lining big pharma's pocket and dividing us so the tyrannical status quo power structure can maintain control. </p>

<p>Agreed but this is a problem across reddit as a whole. You are cool for just trying to understand, some of the people on this sub just need to take a break and I apologize for the downvote brigade.</p>

        <p>Yeah that makes sense, although I would argue that it could also be remedied by either a more serious and unanimous lockdown (e.g. Australia's early on). I would say that lots of elder people have been in palliative care where really there is no option to see family safely- all it would take is one visitor with covid and suddenly a huge amount of at-risk persons are exposed. Unfortunately there just isn't a pretty solution there</p>
<p>I also see what you mean with more naturopathic/holistic approaches to health; ignoring that route is definitely a weakness of western healthcare. However I would challenge you on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Obesity (or more appropriately fatness, as obesity is an arbitrary level of fatness that really doesn't mean anything) is not a medical problem and saying it's a predictor isn't quite accurate. However, fatness is moreso a symptom of various other things that are predictors like nutrition, heart health, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a large stretch to say the vaccine is experimental- it's actually incredibly well tested; just as much as any other vaccine or medicine. Usually vaccines take a long time to be trialled not for actual scientific reasons, rather due to a bunch of delays behind the scenes (which were reduced significantly because 1. the vaccines are very related to others that exist and 2. there was urgency). However if you're against vaccines altogether that's a different story and there's not much to say in response- just a difference in values</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, I definitely despise big pharma; that we can agree on. It's one of the greatest tragedies that science and mass production of life-saving drugs, vaccines, etc. are controlled by corporations and not open-source, non-for-profit entities. Sadly that's the consequence of capitalism</p>
<p>Anyhow thanks for the response, I do appreciate the insight. And you're right, it is a reddity thing in general- although I feel that with 'right-wing' (for lack of a better name I guess lol) takes there does seem to be a weird radicalness about it where any counterpoint or discussion is just dismissed immediately. Maybe that's just an issue with politics in general becoming so intrinsic to our existences... I dunno</p>
