    <strong>Frankfurt airport situation.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m at Frankfurt Airport. It’s just past 10:30am. Huge lines to cafeterias, seating areas are taped off so people have to find another place to eat. Benches all around the airport are packed with people eating next to each other (which was never a problem). People are sitting on the floor while eating - but as long as your hands are clean, you are good, right?
So I asked the cashier at the cafeteria why is the airport administration is implementing measures which can only make things worse, and she had no answer. I also asked her if she or any other employees tried to talk to administration about these nonsensical measures, her answer was - they would not care. 
The reality is - people that work at these type of places can make a change, but most of them are silent and compliant with this stupidity. I deliberately pulled my mask under my chin and spent past 40 minutes like that, passing by security personnel and airport cops. No one cares. 
But it will only get worse if people are going to be silent. People that can make the change by demanding their employers to change the rules back to normal. I hope this post reaches some of them.</p></p>

        <p>The girl is right. The management doesn't care. The opinion of low level employees means nothing to them. Upset customers might have a slightly better impact, but as long as the companies can abuse while hiding behind the government's skirt, nothing will change.</p>

        <p>The answer is always NO if you don’t try. I’m sure some people in administration are also not happy with what’s is happening. It’s about mutual support. This needs to be approached from all possible angles.</p>

        <p>Does your receipt have a survey code on it? If so, fill out the survey and write comments when you get to that point. If not, write to airport management and airline management directly. Post on social media and tag them. They'll never see your post here unless you send it to them.</p>

        <p>I’m planning to send them an email, and I’ll follow your advice on posting it here (since I don’t have any other social media accs), and including a link also. Thanks.</p>
