    <strong>The Crazy one in the family</strong>
    <p><p>Since this is my first post I wanted to thank everyone in this sub for guiding me through this insanity and not letting me cave in because that would be the most convenient think to do so... Thanks.</p>
<p>Mid to late 2020 I had a few discussions turned arguments with my family members where I told them that masks are more for comfort than protection, (cause you know unfortunately life isn't an early 2000s show on Cartoon Network, seriously how big do people think the droplets are) the financial, psychological and nutritional impacts of the lockdowns far outweigh the impact of the virus and that we're going to be stuck in a perpetual cycle of never ending lockdowns and damn I even confronted them with mortality rates and I was told that "For a minister of health one death is way too many so the measures taken make sense", to which I asked so shouldn't this minister outlaw McDonald's, smoking and drinking? Of course there was no reply and they concluded I was just a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>Fast forward to mid to early 2021 and these same people were telling me that the perpetual lockdowns were just common sense because there wasn't a vaccine but there is now to which told them I would not be getting said vaccine. This is when the wacky comments and aggressive side eyes started to happen e.g. "You're just a contrarian all you want to do is argue" or my personal favourite "These people in high positions are highly educated and are paid a lot of money to make these decisions (about lockdowns and forced vaccinations) so we should just comply because we have no right to disagree with them. (yeah lol because crtiical thinking is for idiots) That's when I stopped arguing about whats happening in regards to spike proteins, blood clots, heart inflammation, extreme poverty, obesity freedom, and government control with them because it became clear that if I wanted their actual opinions I would just have to catch a clip of a late night host or listen to one of the anchors on CNN say something. How have you guys handled and dealt with the madness?</p>
<p>Also if you have any statements you were told where all you could think afterwards was "I realised we were wasting time after you said..." Please share them!</p></p>

        <p>Stand your ground. Only time will tell. Months ago everyone on the TV were screaming that the vaccines work, that vaccines will promote herd immunity, that lockdowns will go away.</p>
<p>More studies about coming out about spike proteins, ivermectin, social distancing and only time can tell.</p>

<p>Dude, that's alarming. Maybe ask them if it ever comes up again if they believe there was ever a time where the government didn't act in the best interests of it's citizens. </p>
<p>If they acknowledge the government has done shady shit to its own people then ask them why it is they think they would stop? Why would the government suddenly become moral?</p>
<p>If they don't believe the government has ever done anything to its population that I have a fun list for you.</p>

        <p>These governments didn't wake up one day and have morals. They didn't travel down a yellow brick road with a tin man and a scarecrow so they could ask the wizard for a conscience. They are the same type of people that they have always been and always will be and to think that a modern government couldn't do what past governments did is asinine because those past governments were the modern government at that time.</p>
