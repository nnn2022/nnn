    <strong>2020: The Year of Gaslighting</strong>
    <p><p>Gaslighting is a strategy where you do something bad then when confronted by it you claim you are not doing it no matter how obvious your behavior is. Then you claim your accuser is guilty of what you are doing. I believe this is the main strategy of our opponents in government and corporate positions. The effect it has is it wears down the confidence of the person in the right and makes them feel crazy. It takes advantage of their better nature and their concern for others and makes them feel guilty.</p>
<p>Most obvious example: You don’t want to wear a fake cloth mask 24/7 for a virus with a 99.8% survival rate? You must be a crazy, unscientific person.</p>
<p>The most recent example is our opponents are guilty of spreading lies. They claimed Covid came from bat soup. They claimed quarantining young healthy people would stop Covid when it did nothing. Then they called you crazy for not wanting to stay inside for a year or thinking a virus lab operated by a communist country a couple miles from the start of the pandemic should be investigated. They are calling the truth tellers spreaders of misinformation and killers. They are then using that as justification to take away their 1st amendment rights. They are the ones responsible for killing people by causing suicide, drug overdoses, starvation and lost health care from the damaged economy.</p>
<p>Another example some won’t agree with (that’s okay): there was no cheating in the election, you must be crazy to think that. Meanwhile there is countless testimony and data showing election laws were broken. They did this out of desperation because people are getting it. We are the majority.</p>
<p>We are the normal ones. Stay strong folks.</p></p>

        <p>The other side always claims we are the ones gaslighting them, so now I like to throw it back in their face. Call them out for gaslighting, call them out for using strawman, call them out for false equivalence. If they're going to use those words against us, we are going to use them right back at them.</p>

        <p>Exactly when they accuse us of nonsense we should use the exact same language against them.</p>
