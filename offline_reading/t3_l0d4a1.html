    <strong>"Lockdowns didn't work because not enough people complied"! Here's why that's dumb.</strong>
    <p><p>I see this shit get thrown around so often and fuck me is it ever asinine. There really is but one claim here made by the pro-lockdown sort which is as such: Lockdowns work, there just isn't enough compliance for them to work.</p>
<p>Let's pick through both parts.</p>
<p><strong>Lockdowns Work</strong>. Says who? Where are the studies that show lockdowns to be effective? Where is the precedent? We're following the science of course, so show me the science on why lockdowns work. </p>
<p>Of course one might say "it's intuitive! Less people out and about means less people interacting which means less transmission!". Sure, I'll entertain that notion, but let's call a spade a spade here, all that proves is that in <em>theory</em>, based on some <em>intuition</em>, lockdowns work. Let's not confuse theory with reality. In <em>theory</em> cars can run on ethanol. In practicality, they don't - far too much corn required. In <em>theory</em> we could eat nothing but chicken and broccoli and exercise daily to combat most other ailments, but that's just not practical. If something doesn't work in practicality, then it doesn't work, regardless of whether or not it works in theory (especially when that theory is based on nothing but speculation).</p>
<p><strong>There just isn't enough compliance!</strong> Who says? First of all, I never saw a compliance metric appended to the lockdown orders that stated "with x% of compliance we can expect lockdowns to be y% effective". Before we get into why that's dumb let's address the most glaring concern which is that <em>there is no fucking way to measure compliance</em>. Are there government officials with clipboards in every public space taking tallies? Is there a government official in your car with you making sure you wear that mask? Is the government watching you to make sure you keep your mask on while you get your salad tossed? We're surely going that route, but we're not there yet, so saying "there isn't enough compliance" holds zero weight whatsoever.</p>
<p>That is unless, however, the percentage of compliance needed is 100% of compliance 100% of the time. If that's the case then sure, someone shops without a mask, not enough compliance, but if the mandates that have been in place for <strong>10 fucking months</strong> are that fucking delicate then it shouldn't even be up for debate whether or not the world is being run by fucking idiots.</p>
<p>Rant over feel free to use this against any pro-lockdowners that you might come across I'd love to see them defend it.</p></p>

        <p>Bro, it's not even a theory. Theories have support under them. "Lockdowns work" has never graduated from a mere hypothesis.</p>
<p>I would also include that an "expert" who is constantly wrong and has the goalposts on a fucking roller-coaster track, is, in fact, <em>not</em> an expert.</p>
<p>No one would hire an architect who constantly built buildings that collapsed. No one would keep a chef around who could barely microwave a hotdog. And yet... here we are.</p>

        <p>The best argument against blaming lockdown failure on non-compliance is the one of supply of non-compliant individuals. If a limited fraction of the population is non-compliant, that group is supposed to get infected and spread the virus. So far so good. But what happens if a lockdown is failing to contain the spread week after week? <strong>Surely the non-compliant, who are the first to get infected, will eventually become immune</strong>. Does a new group of non-compliant emerge suddenly from the compliant ones?</p>
<p>Or is it simply more likely that compliance has nothing to do with the chances of infection, because the measures just don't work? So that a compliant and a non-compliant person have very similar chances of getting infected and equally similar ones to spread the virus?</p>

        <p>I actually saw this idea formulated very concisely on one of the subs, I elaborated the mechanism as I imagine it.</p>
<p>I am also one of the non-compliant, have been commuting to work full time, going out, meeting people, traveling. I thought I might have had the virus early on, took a serum test - negative. Have been healthy since, very physically active so I would notice if I am unwell. Family in my household tested also negative recently.</p>
<p>As I've said before, behavior matters very little. You can't spread a virus you don't have.</p>

<p>While I like your logic there's a hole.  No one has said the virus would infect everyone who is non-compliant. The infection rate is still low single digits.  So the answer to your argument is simply that there is a large enough pool of non-compliant people to keep it going. </p>
<p>I think the most reasonable argument is simply one of numbers.  NPI <em>does</em> have an effect on transmission.  But aside from a few Redditors and some other pathological germaphobes, no one can ever be 100% isolated, even if that would work.  By how much does it reduce your chance of infection should be the question.  Is it enough to matter? </p>
<p>Which kind of brings us back where we started almost a year ago.  NPI can slow but not stop a pandemic.  Anyone who claims it can is full of silly juice.  We are just dragging it out.</p>

<p>&rt;I think the most reasonable argument is simply one of numbers. </p>
<p>So the question is how big the non-compliant pool is in comparison to the fraction of people who have been infected. In most countries with widespread infection, roughly 30% of the population have been infected so far. You can get that number from dividing deaths by the IFR, or from national estimates such as the one from the CDC (coming up to &rt;100 million infected in the US so far).</p>
<p>So the fraction of non-compliant needs to be quite large to let them infect nearly one third of the population, considering that compliant ones are at least partially protected. It is probably more than single digit percent. Which is admittedly not impossible, but poses the problem of ensuring compliance to a high enough level. If even the strictest non-pharmaceutical intervention leaves 10% non-compliant, then it is hard to expect that anything will ever work 100%.</p>

        <p>&rt;Where are the studies that show lockdowns to be effective?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7">Here’s</a> one I found after about five minutes of googling.  It’s from Nature, which is apparently one of the most cited international, peer-reviewed scientific journals.  So y’know, not that hard to find.</p>
<p>In fact, looking at the study you asked for, lockdowns seem to be the most effective way to mitigate the spread by far(figure 2 in particular shows a stark difference in the outcome of different govt responses).  </p>
<p>As for your point about compliance, well, I’m a little confused.  You claim that without a compliance metric, arguing that we didn’t comply enough is fruitless, while admitting in the same breath that such a metric is nearly impossible to gather.  Are you implying that we simply can’t know whether or not people are wearing masks in public, as though you don’t have eyes that you can look at them with?  I get that that’s not a number, but at a certain point, seeing dozens of people without masks all together as I have, it doesn’t matter.  That‘s a lockdown-extending amount of noncompliance.</p>
<p>That’s also taking in your assumption that we need to physically check everyone in public in order to get a decent number, which is false.  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341028483_How_to_survey_citizens'_compliance_with_COVID-19_public_health_measures_Evidence_from_three_survey_experiments">Here</a> is a study from Science Gate(not peer-reviewed, but generally well respected) that shows a method of surveying people in order to extrapolate overall Covid compliance.  Or, if you think surveys are unreliable, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211415/">here</a> is a proposition for a more grounded approach to compliance(from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, again not peer-reviewed, but generally well respected), though I’m sure you’ll balk at the “big tech knows when I leave my house” aspect of it, as if smartphone manufacturers don’t know where you and I are right now.</p>
<p>All this to say, did you just write out this Reddit post without bothering to check if the things you said in it were true?  You say things like “who says?” or “show me the studies”, but the answers to those questions were comically simple for me to find.  I just typed “do lockdowns work” into google and found out.</p>

        <p>&rt; An alternative way to estimate the course of the epidemic is to calculate backwards from observed deaths to the number of infections. We introduce a Bayesian mechanistic model linking the infection cycle to observed deaths, inferring the total population infected (attack rates) as well as <em>Rt</em>. We assess whether there is evidence that interventions have so far been successful at reducing <em>Rt</em> to values below 1. We simulate a hypothetical counterfactual scenario in which <em>Rt</em> remains at starting levels to estimate the deaths that would have occurred without interventions. </p>
<p>This study relies heavily on models and Neil Ferguson is one of the authors. It does not prove that lockdowns work because it assumes that people would not have taken any voluntary measures to avoid infection absent the lockdowns. Also, it was published 7 months ago. Not convincing at all.</p>

        <p>I don't quite appreciate your condescending tone right from the get-go. I'm not sure what it is with people on Reddit having erections about being condescending but I'll chock it up to this being something you're passionate about and your emotions getting the best of you. Clearly you're relatively smart, I'll treat you as such if you promise to do the same to me if we discuss this further.</p>
<p>I'll start with an apology for my lack of articulation. The post wasn't really supposed to disprove that lockdowns do/don't work and the statement of "Where are the studies that show lockdowns to be effective?" was off the mark. What I should have said was where are the numbers that quantify compliance for countries in which lockdowns are shown to work or not to work (I'll get to this in a minute, I read your article and I have some thoughts). My main gripe is this idea of "cases down = people complying, cases up = people not complying". That's just silly, you must admit that it is. Are people just fluidly deciding whether or not they comply on a whim? One must assume that the same groups of people (relatively) are the ones not complying throughout each wave of cases and that this number of people not complying doesn't ebb and flow.</p>
<p>Regarding your second statement. I'm not exactly sure what's confusing. I'll try to be more clear:</p>
<p>&rt;You claim that without a compliance metric, arguing that we didn’t comply enough is fruitless, while admitting in the same breath that such a metric is nearly impossible to gather.</p>
<p>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Of course I said them in the same breath - they're related. Again, let me emphasize my point, which is this "cases down = people complying, cases up = people not complying" attitude and why it's stupid. You can't begin to say that not enough people are complying when there is no definition of "enough", especially not when there is a reliable way to count "enough".</p>
<p>&rt;as though you don’t have eyes that you can look at them with?</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you're particularly well-versed in social interaction but typically if you want to get along with someone and nurture a constructive discourse it helps not to talk to your conversation partner as if they're a child. Of course I have eyes. I don't think that "I saw 12 people without a mask today therefore we're not at <em>enough</em> compliance, when <em>enough</em> isn't even defined, is either an accurate method of extrapolation nor a valid basis on which to continue to hold a country in an economic vice-grip.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341028483_How_to_survey_citizens'_compliance_with_COVID-19_public_health_measures_Evidence_from_three_survey_experiments">Here</a> is a study from Science Gate(not peer-reviewed, but generally well respected) that shows a method of surveying people in order to extrapolate overall Covid compliance</p>
<p>I'm not subscribed to that publication so the full article isn't available to me. However a quick read through the abstract tells me that it's more focused on how to frame questions to yield honest answers than measuring compliance using those questions. Nonetheless it seems interesting, just not in the context of this discussion.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211415/">here</a> is a proposition for a more grounded approach to compliance(from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, again not peer-reviewed, but generally well respected), though I’m sure you’ll balk at the “big tech knows when I leave my house” aspect of it, as if smartphone manufacturers don’t know where you and I are right now.</p>
<p>It's interesting to me how quickly you assume the type of person that I am. I've spent my career working at tech companies. I'm well aware of what they are/aren't capable of. Anyone that doesn't believe that their data is being sold in 2020 is foolish, I don't think you'll find many people that are that ignorant these days. Looking at the figures provided in the literature, it should be reasonable to infer that states with a high score fare better than those with a low score. This is clearly not the case: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/uAQuLZR">https://imgur.com/a/uAQuLZR</a> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6a1YyfJ">https://imgur.com/a/6a1YyfJ</a> . Feel free to continue checking if you think I'm cherry picking. There doesn't appear to be any correlation between the compliance by state and the general trend of cases.</p>
<p>So this of course begs the question: <strong>how much compliance is necessary</strong>. You say</p>
<p>&rt;at a certain point, seeing dozens of people without masks all together as I have, it doesn’t matter. That‘s a lockdown-extending amount of noncompliance.</p>
<p>Okay, sure. But <strong>by your own sources</strong> this is incorrect. If your sources are credible, then we should be able to compare states with low compliance and states with high compliance and see a notable difference in the trend. We don't, why then is low compliance grounds to continue lockdowns? Like I said "in the same breath" - we need to define "x% of compliance for y% of benefit" AND "this is how we will obtain x%". The two aren't mutually exclusive. Maybe the relationship between x% and y% is not linear. Maybe only 20% compliance is necessary for 80% benefit with diminishing returns afterwards. I must re-iterate that my point here isn't to refute whether or not lockdowns work but rather to point out how asinine the argument of "cases up = noncompliance, cases down = compliance". This is  respiratory virus. The flu doesn't fluctuate seasonally because of non-compliance, it does so because it's a respiratory virus and respiratory viruses transmit better in cool, dry climates. Non-compliance isn't the only thing that spreads disease.</p>
<p>&rt;All this to say, did you just write out this Reddit post without bothering to check if the things you said in it were true? You say things like “who says?” or “show me the studies”, but the answers to those questions were comically simple for me to find. I just typed “do lockdowns work” into google and found out.</p>
<p>It's Reddit... I'm not submitting a paper for peer review here. It is "comically simple" to find studies that refute your claims. Here's one out of Stanford: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13484">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13484</a>. Unlike your last two, this one is peer reviewed. I don't see the point in throwing papers and articles around when I am just as capable of finding information backing my point as you are in finding information that backs yours. Your last two citations provided shaky support for your claims at best.</p>
<p>I do say "who says", I do say "show me the studies", because I have seen <strong>nothing</strong> that provides <strong>definitive, objective</strong> proof that lockdowns are worth implementing to contain the virus. This is <strong>a virus</strong> and it's pure hubris to think that we can simply sit in our homes and wait it out until it goes away. I will concede that a month-long lockdown would make sense in order for the government to get their ducks in a row and prepare for the future, but this perpetual lockdown is absolute insanity. Nevermind the negative repercussions of this that I haven't even touched upon - families losing their means of financial support, suicide, drug overdoses, depression, <strong>not living life for a full year</strong>. Even if lockdowns were 100% effective at handling covid if we forever adhered to the policies it would not be worth it. There are plenty of things in life that follow the principal of "the side effect can't be worse than the cure" but for some reason that's been thrown out the window for Covid.</p>

        <p>BONUS CONTENT:</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7">Here’s</a> one I found after about five minutes of googling. It’s from Nature, which is apparently one of the most cited international, peer-reviewed scientific journals. So y’know, not that hard to find.</p>
<p>The more I quote you the more obnoxious I find you, I'll admit. I'm tired of writing this response so I'll just say this. I have a handful of my own publications in quantitative fields. I make a living designing predictive models. Businesses use those predictive models to drive their decisions. I'm saying this to give you context for what I'm about to say: Take a model's output with a grain of salt. I notice they didn't account for cultural factors and focused only on deaths and cases. Take a country like Italy where you typically have multiple generations of families under one roof (can confirm, am Italian) and compare it to Germany where you have more wealth, larger homes, single generation homes. These two cannot be compared 1:1. This isn't to say that the model is bad, the purpose isn't to give the whole pictures.</p>
<p>&rt;The number of daily infections estimated by our model drops immediately after an intervention, as we assume that all infected people become immediately less infectious through the intervention.</p>
<p>My guy, the figures show a literally non-continuous step down in terms of infections. Anybody with a hint of analytical experience would know this isn't natural. As it turns out, it isn't: <strong>the rate of transmission decreases drastically because this is their assumption, they baked it in, they were very clear about this</strong>. The point seemed to be to model whether or not R_f would rise past 1 after these measures.</p>
<p>Listen, I get what you're trying to do here, I can tell by the way you speak that you probably look down your nose at anyone that doesn't share your views on this matter, which is in itself a mark of stupidity. I'd recommend you check your tone, you come off as a smug little shit and it's very hard for me or anyone else to take a smug little shit seriously at all. If you're genuinely trying to open up a dialog, be respectful, if your goal is to just be a smug little shit (which it seems to be), then carry on.</p>

        <p>Alright, in truth, you got me.  I just discovered this sub today, and frankly, I did just want to be a smug shit.  I wanted to say some snarky shit to people I jumped to conclusions about and get banned.  Since you’ve responded genuinely, I’ll respond in kind.  And, for what it’s worth, I’m sorry for talking down to you and making assumptions about you.  That’s not how we get through this</p>
<p>Your main idea of “cases down/up = people complying/not is silly” makes a degree of sense, with a small caveat I’m sure you’re aware of: some people decide whether to take precautions or not based off of whether cases are up/down.  Put another way, that’s the people who reason “Well we all put in these measures and the cases aren’t even that bad, that means that the infection rates must be lower than we thought!”  We can most likely assume that this group of people is negligibly small though, so it’s not really a potent counterpoint.</p>
<p>One thing that I find kinda frustrating regarding the next section of your comment is the conflation of mask wearing with lockdowns or capacity restrictions that I’ve seen here.  Lots of noncompliance examples I see on here are about masks, but that gets extrapolated into the economic failure that’s accompanied the pandemic.  I know when you talk about an economic vice-grip, you’re talking about curfews, business restrictions, and lockdowns, but try not to juxtapose that with examples regarding people not wearing masks.  </p>
<p>Anyway, the point I was trying to make there was that your argument about the measurability of compliance seems...nonfalsifiable.  Defining what a reliable way to count “enough” may look like would be very helpful for this.  Otherwise it sounds like you’re saying, “There’s nothing that says that we’re not compliant enough, and even if there is, I doubt it’s accurate.”  That, combined with the intentionally ridiculous suggestions of government workers physically watching your every move made it sound like <em>nothing</em> would be a reliable way to measure compliance for you.</p>
<p>I also definitely failed to communicate that expecting figures <em>with</em> the lockdown orders is ambitious at best.  Before 2020, nobody had dealt with an outbreak of COVID-19 before.  Speculative figures could’ve been worked out, but that’s all they would’ve been, speculative.  Predictive models need data, right?  Where would the data have come from?  You could maybe try and use other diseases, but you’re never gonna be able to just guess at covid’s infectiousness, mortality rate, etc and expect to get that right enough to put it with a government order.  I suppose this is just your point said another way, buuuut...</p>
<p>My point with the articles I linked is that while that task is impossible at the outset of the pandemic, it should be pretty reasonable now that we have data from an actual COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>For the first article, just FYI I’m not subscribed either, I was just reading the public full-text.  Which, yes, is more focused on how to frame covid surveys such that the results they get are accurate, but that means that surveys are a possible way to measure compliance.  Again, this was more to answer your point about govt agents watching you get your salad tossed and point out that getting data on a population’s behavior isn’t nearly as hard as your post makes it seem.</p>
<p>As for the second article I linked, what exactly are you getting at with those 4 graphs?  Is the point that cases grew in Nevada at about the same rate as in other states?  I would expect a state with a higher grade to have fewer cases per person than a state with a lower grade.  You can’t just compare the proportional growth in cases, you have to take the overall population of the state into account.  For example, Mississippi has about 96% the population that Nevada does(2.9 vs 3.0), but about 140%(~1400 vs ~1000)the new covid cases for today, Jan 18th.  That difference implies that Nevada is indeed faring better than Mississippi, right?</p>
<p>Finally, at the end of your comment you double down on saying “show me the studies” and yet you also demonstrate that you can find peer-reviewed studies supporting your claims just as easily as I can do for mine.  What would definitive, objective proof even look like, if scientific papers are out the window?</p>
<p>I get it, the pandemic has been frustrating.  Probably a big reason I was such a shit in my first comment.  And I agree, this year-long, half-ass “lockdown” has been far tougher than it needed to be.  I want to go eat in a restaurant again too, sit down in a park, hug my friends again.  I just think that the best way we get there is with a brief, strong effort to eliminate the virus.  Not the unending softlock we’ve been doing, but also not by acting like it’s just a cold.  And I think we’ve been really lagging on the “strong” part of that, and it feels disingenuous to say that there’s no way to tell.</p>

        <p>Quality response.</p>
<p>The better question is if lockdowns are worth it despite mixed evidence of how deadly the virus is for most people. For me, and for what I would assume most people on this sub - NO.</p>

        <p>You’re not accounting for the FACT that COVID-19 was in the wild in June 2019 at the earliest.</p>
<p>That’s 10 months of spread before any lockdowns happened.</p>
<p>That alone means lockdowns were never going to do anything because we’d already passed the point where they would have been helpful.</p>

        <p>"Sweden and South Korea, countries without lock-down, fared as good as the countries in cluster 2." (Cluster 2 were countries with strict lockdowns)</p>
<p>"Complete and partial lockdown appeared to be 
effective in 4 regions, but not in the 3 largest provinces." </p>
<p>"the most restrictive 
scenario for exiting lockdown was the most effective in reducing transmission, however, all 8 
scenarios yielded a second wave once social distancing strategies were relaxed and schools 
reopened." So, in other words, lockdowns work if we do them forever (this is a virus. We're not going to eradicate a virus off the face of the earth).</p>
<p>There's also a whole section on the cost of lockdowns and why they're ineffective. <strong>However, in that section, they still bold all of the positives while leaving the negative points unbolded and unassuming, like this.</strong> This tells me that they're biased toward presenting positive information, rather than giving the full picture. I would be wary of trusting information from biased news sources. </p>
<p>I left a few points above (minus those listed in the whole section on why lockdowns may not be a catch-all solution). I hope that these points help to illustrate that lockdowns don't definitely work. Maybe in some countries they do. That's a moot point. Making beef illegal in India for instance is easy, more or less everyone there is religious and shuns it. Making it illegal in the states is unheard of. There are cultural and ideological factors to consider.</p>
<p>I'll meet you half way though. As a temporary solution - 2 weeks to flatten the curve - or whatever, I understand them and they make sense. Not as a 9 month blanket solution.</p>

        <p>I think that lockdowns work in the short term. When you ask people to stay at home for 2 weeks people seem to listen. When you start having 2nd and 3rd month long lockdowns is where it seems to fall apart. People are tired and no longer care.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but it’s been proven that even IF we do a complete lockdown, the US Government won’t fucking support us! Over 19 million people are facing eviction due to lockdowns and lack of government support. What makes you think that number won’t skyrocket due to a complete nationwide shut down? It’s bad enough that people can’t work and we are losing millions of jobs and small businesses, it won’t end if this continues and escalates.</p>
