    <strong>Covid causes ED!</strong>
    <p><p>Had a good laugh today when I was arguing with someone about how the Covid risk is extremely low for healthy people under 50, and they countered with an article about how Covid causes ED</p>
<p>Indulge yourself by checking it out here:
<a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/yes-covid-19-can-cause-erectile-dysfunction/">Yes, Covid-19 Can Cause Erectile Dysfunction </a></p>
<p>Sounds pretty newsworthy right? I mean if you‚Äôre not worried about dying, you still might be worried about not being able to get it up after contracting the virus. So let‚Äôs dive into the article, which breaks its case down in 3 points:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Vascular effects. Erectile function is a predictor of heart disease, so we know that the vascular system and reproductive system are connected. We also know that COVID-19 can cause hyperinflammation throughout the body, especially in the heart and surrounding muscles. Blood supply to the penis can become blocked or narrowed as a result of a new or worsened vascular condition caused by the virus.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, so Covid <em>could</em> cause hyperinflammation, which <em>could</em> block blood supply down low. Any numbers on this? How many people have experienced it, ie what‚Äôs the likelihood? Doesn‚Äôt say, just says it <em>could</em> happen if this and this other thing happen. Remember, the title of the article is ‚ÄúCovid can cause ED‚Äù so might be a good time to provide some evidence of it actually happening. But this is only the first part of the argument, so let‚Äôs move on</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Psychological impact. Sexual activity is closely associated with mental health. The stress, anxiety and depression caused by the virus and pandemic can be linked to sexual dysfunction and poor mood.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>At this point you‚Äôre probably laughing, as you should be. The article is only on its second point and has already pivoted away from talking about how Covid can totally cause ED, and is now talking about how the <em>psychological effects</em> of being afraid of Covid could give you ED. Seems like a bit of a catch 22, no? You should be afraid of Covid because it could give you ED, but also fear of Covid could give you ED. This is a hilarious but also pathetic excuse for a scientific article at this point, almost rivaling Babylon Bee content. Sadly their 3rd point gets even worse</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Overall health deterioration. ED is typically a symptom of an underlying problem. Men with poor health are at greater risk for developing ED and also for having a severe reaction to COVID-19. Since the virus can cause a plethora of health issues, general poor health is cause for concern both for ED and other complications.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>‚ÄúMen with poor health are at greater risk for developing ED and also for having severe reactions to Covid.‚Äù Sigh üôÑ. I guess our friends over at Cleveland clinic aren‚Äôt familiar with the old adage ‚Äúcorrelation does not prove causation‚Äù. Just because someone is simultaneously at higher risk for two things, does not mean one causes the other. This last point would not even qualify for a seventh grade science paper, let alone a published article from a major medical center. But, such is journalism and our medical establishment these days</p></p>

        <p>Amen, and if you agree with my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mwxuf9/porn_is_the_reason_youre_still_working_from_home/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">last post</a> then maybe Covid does cause ED after all (albeit indirectly)</p>
