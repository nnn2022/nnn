    <strong>New York City's Downward Spiral</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/08/new-york-citys-downward-spiral/">https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/08/new-york-citys-downward-spiral/</a> </p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio has filled three Upper West Side hotels that previously catered to European tourists with hundreds of homeless people, drug addicts, and sex offenders, and the <em>New York Post’</em>s <a href="https://nypost.com/cover/august-9-2020/">wood</a> on Sunday <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/08/nyc-moms-fleeing-upper-west-side-amid-crime-and-chaos/">was</a> UPPER WEST SLIDE. The <em>Post</em> isn’t making this up. Outside one of the hotels, the Belleclaire, a dazed-looking man stood on the corner in a bathrobe and slippers. A few yards away, a perky half-dozen or so leftists responded to the <em>Post</em> story by bringing a large box of colored chalk and scrawling welcoming slogans to the homeless in several colors on the sidewalk in front of the entrance to the Belleclaire.</p>
<p>Even in this exceedingly well-heeled corner of Manhattan, the disorder is in your face, everywhere. In my building, someone has been sneaking in, grabbing people’s mail and packages from the lobby where they normally sit unmolested, and opening them in the stairwell, discarding whatever items have no interest. Walking down the stairs, I found an opened envelope containing two new passports, and delivered it to the addressee in the building.</p>
<p>Great article, well described that paints a grim picture for the city... I wonder how the city will look when the Pension Fund ponzi scheme blows up ? NY Pension is in a crisis, Oregon, Illinois just to name a few as well. The US has taken a serious blow in standards of living recently, if it doesn't clean up it's mess, certain blue cities will become almost unlivable</p></p>

        <p>I was in midtown Manhattan yesterday to buy a couple things. I used to spend hours just walking around Manhattan, but yesterday it was so depressing I just went home straight after I got what I needed. Boarded up shops and for rent signs everywhere. Tons of garbage in the streets (well, more than usual). Every block littered with graffiti. The scant few people about were walking around like zombies with masks. </p>
<p>I'm too young to know what Manhattan was like in the 80s was like but it looked like how I imagine it did then. It's like a bomb went off. It's hard to imagine the city bouncing back from this. I'm sure it could recover, but Gov. Cuomo is just making things worse by keeping things closed, and everyone is just, I don't know, fine with the city being destroyed. It honestly breaks my heart.</p>

        <p>It's so sad. My mom left NYC in the 80s and has never since been back; she says now she expects it looks just like that. I'm afraid you're right it would - from stories I've heard. We went a few times in the last few years. There will be nothing left - and people being alright with it, even accepting or encouraging of it, is so sad.</p>

        <p>My dad lived in NYC in the 80’s, it scarred him so much he’s never been back, ever. He’s refused every trip we’ve ever asked him to come along on. He said he now expects it to be worse than it was back then.</p>

        <p>I've visited new york city many times since 2014 through 2019. And I'm glad I've visited the city these days before De Blasio deliberately mismanaged the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I was there in October for 4 days. Really enjoyed my time but I’m not used to that city vibe and looked forward to leaving. But I had a really nice time regardless. I stayed in China town and was there to attend the business party a friend of mine from the west coast threw. I took a Lyft to the World Trade Center area and got a slice of pizza and met a cool couple who was there to review haunted houses. We chatted and then I walked through the WTC memorial. I remember thinking I was grateful to see NYC come back from that. The party was great, my friend and I had a great time exploring the city together and I figured I wouldn’t go back for a couple years.</p>
<p>Unless someone comes in and cleans it up like they did in the past, I don’t think I’ll ever go back. It’s reminiscent of everything my parents told me about it in the 70s and 80s. Huge bummer.</p>

<p>You know, I remember 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy. There was a lot of destruction, the mood was somber, but people rallied around for recovery. This is the opposite. The disaster is totally self inflicted, our leaders are in no rush to end it and the people don't care. It's like they want destruction.</p>

        <p>Yeah I know people who live there making every excuse in the book for it. I think a lot of people glorify what NYC was in the 70s and 80s and they see this as getting back to that. Some people have had boring lives to a fault and want to say they experienced a “gritty city”. Be careful what you wish for. I don’t want to hear any bitching from them in the coming years.</p>

        <p>I left New York years ago, and as I was leaving I had regrets, but had to move because of my career. When you're from there living the day-to-day, with time you think everywhere else is subpar and you dread even the thought leaving the city (it's such a weird attitude held by so many living there). In reality, it grinds you down to a shitty version of yourself. I last visited before the pandemic madness hit and even then I couldn't wait to leave, and many of my friends and family thought I was crazy. Nowadays, I wake up every single morning with an even more immense joy that I don't live there anymore. Not to shit on NYC <em>too</em> hard, but leaving it is definitely not detrimental.</p>

        <p>Not only did the lockdowns end my fun life here, they really ripped the wool off my eyes in that so many people my age (20s/30s) supported the lockdowns. It also completely ripped the wool off my eyes about a lot of other ideas I had about things, politically. I have friends here but I'm not sure I fit in any more. My lease is up soon so planning to leave in a couple months. At first I was sad, then angry, now I'm relieved I've made the decision and ready to be gone.
Will enjoy the food while I can :)</p>
