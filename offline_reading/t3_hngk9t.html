    <strong>The economic second wave</strong>
    <p><p>While the doomers are fretting about a second wave of infections, I am more worried about what I see as a potential second economic wave. In the UK the lockdown ended for pubs and restaurants last weekend and I have been talking to a few people who have been out. At least in restaurants, the experience sounds horrible. My daughter went to a local Indian restaurant last night. Usually, it is a busy restaurant and the staff are really lovely and friendly. Last night they were all wearing visors and the place was nearly empty. I've heard similar tales from elsewhere: perspex screens between tables, limited menus to reduce interaction with staff and face masks everywhere. </p>
<p>I seriously wonder how long these places will last if this continues. They must be very close to failing already and when people realise what a nasty experience dining out is, they will surely vote with their feet.</p></p>

        <p>My boss used to eat out probably 15 meals a week. Often times taking a bunch of people with him. He's old, single, works hard, doesn't cook, spends freely, tips generously. Not anymore. Will not participate in mask theater. Guy was spending probably $1000/week in restaurants, and he's not spending it because of the weird shit, not for any fear of getting sick.</p>

        <p>I used to stop at the bar down the street from my house after work probably 2-3 times a week. I'd eat and have a beer or two, I probably spent $100-$150/week, occasionally inviting some friends with me and picking up the tab. I'm a very good tipper, often tipping 30%+, the bartenders and cooks all know me by name. </p>
<p>Haven't been to that bar in weeks, ever since they went full covitard.</p>

        <p>Most places here in MN aren't requiring it for customers, I think they know they can't afford to. But I went for breakfast the other day and I felt like the waitress was annoyed with me for not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>They can get fucked. That's why many of these places are going to go out of business. If they are smart they will buck the system and run their business like normal. I'm an economist whose been tracking this and most of these fearmongering restaurants pushing the masks are absolutely going to go out of business in the next 6 months.</p>

        <p>I think governor Walz would do that if he could get away with it. I think it's like that within the city limits of Minneapolis because the mayor is a woketard. But I won't eat anywhere here in the city or even go to the stores because of it. I just drive to the suburbs. Worth it to avoid the mask.</p>

        <p>Not just dining. My local Sainsbury's has more perspex, masks and visors now than it did during lockdown's peak. The whole thing is crazy virtue signalling at its finest.</p>
<p>What's more, going off your point: It's sad to think that the nicest restaurant I've seen since the start of this crisis started is a Chow Asian Kitchen in an M4 service station. Their only change was the removal of chopsticks (you now have to use a knife and fork given to you in a bag).  </p>
<p>Let's hope that people do vote with their feet.</p>

80 percent of nyc restaurants couldnt afford June rent. Granted it's probably the most extreme case, but I assume this isn't too far off from many places.</p>

        <p>It’s not like that everywhere.</p>
<p>I live in a village in Devon. I went to our local Indian restaurant on Sunday to grab a takeaway. Several couples sitting dining, apart from a bottle of hand sanitizer on the counter and a crappy A4 sign about distancing it was normal. No masks, no visors, no tape on the floor....the guy handed me my bag, held the door open and gave me a friendly pat on the back as I left.</p>
<p>This morning was haircut time. Same guy I always use, does appointments but always has. When I walked in he was stood chatting with the guy who does tattoos in the shop behind, no masks or anything. He said he was happy to wear a mask/visor if it’s what I wanted and if I wanted to wear one it wouldn’t cause a problem - he cracked in entirely PPE free, only difference was the gown was a disposable sheet.</p>
<p>Businesses are going a bit nuts because the guidance has been vague and crappy and they’ve possible misread the room and felt that customers would prefer to “feel safe”. I fully expect those things to wane as soon as they start getting feedback. When restaurant A takes down their Perspex screens because customers hate them and gets more trade for it, you bet your ass restaurants B C and D will follow suit.</p>
<p>The mood is definitely shifting, the barber was saying out of the 50 or so people he’s seen since reopening they’ve all been fed up of restrictions and just wanted to get back to normal. Social media is NOT representative of the real world, don’t forget that</p>

        <p>That's really encouraging. As you say, it is quite hard to judge the public mood but hopefully the move to normality will spread organically, irrespective of Government daftness.</p>

        <p>They’re not fretting about a second wave.  They are cheering it on and praying for it.  They WANT millions dead.  Talk to one of them.  They’re pissed that more people aren’t dead.</p>

        <p>It's the same in the US. I've worked jn restaurants for a decade and it's bad. Many restaurants are open, but so many of them in my area are supporting all this. They just want to stay open to make more money than being closed, but still get the satisfaction and press of "doing the right thing". Even those restauraunts who are over all this aren't making any money either for all the things you said. In my state any bars with more than 70% of their sales from alcohol are closed, but I guess if you sell food the virus doesn't come inside? Even if dinein restaurants are open, people are weary about going out to any restaurant or bar. Restaurants are already one of, if not the, lowest profit margin industry, and have already been in decline. The outlook is not pretty.</p>

        <p>The whole point is to "reset" the economy, and this involves destroying small businesses and the middle class.  The Fed has been printing money for decades and the chickens are coming home to roost.  In order to balance the books, trillions of dollars of phantom value has to be written down.</p>

        <p>Yea, my local pub opened up and I popped in to meet a mate there yesterday, it has a massive outside area but the inside of the pub is just a horror show.  Lines to form queues to the bar and tell you where to stand, big sign on the wall telling you to register to the government track and trace system, hand sanitiser bloody everywhere, and a ridiculous one way system round the whole building including outside.  Massive piece of ugly perspex across the front of the bar and a busybody staff member walking around to enforce the 'rules'.  </p>
<p>We had 1 pint then went back to drinking in the park like we've been doing anyway, it's a much more pleasant experience.  The pub is meant to be somewhere you can relax and enjoy a few drinks with mates, how can anyone enjoy that experience.</p>

        <p>I'm quite worried about both -- the economic second wave is really bad news for people who work in restaurants. But it is driven by people not wanting to eat out while there are cases nearby. So what's the option? Assume the people are making these decisions on their own and when the government says "we're open," like 25% will say "have fun with that, I'm staying in." Restaurants are hard to make work financially at the best of times, do you think they'll survive on 75% revenue?</p>
<p>A second wave of the virus is just going to scare more people, I guess the restaurants in places that respond really aggressively will do best as they can return to real normal faster.</p>

        <p>I'm an economist whose been tracking this since mid march. As you've stated, The economic destruction that is happening now is unprecedented and much worse than the virus. These businesses that want to play the mask virtue signaling game deserve to go out of business. They are losing customers not because of Covid fear but because nobody wants to eat at a place where everyone is wearing a Hazmat suit. I believe anywhere from 20-40% of restuarant businesses will go out of business in the next year if this goes on further.</p>
