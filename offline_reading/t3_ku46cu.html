        <p>No, this sub is largely made up of people who see reality for what it is. We've all been sick before. We've all called in sick from work and referred to how we were feeling as "death warmed over." We've all had respiratory infections that lasted over a week. Some of us have had pneumonia, some even severe enough to require hospitalization. We all survived and got on with life.</p>
<p>In addition, we can look around at our workplaces, neighborhoods and towns and not see more people sick. We're not hearing about more friends and family members being hospitalized. We're not attending more funerals. If this is so deadly to warrant all of these societal changes and restrictions, we should be able to see this with our own eyes. </p>
<p>By the way, most of us aren't used to staying home and spending all our time in front of the TV and other devices. Most of us are used to living real lives. We've sacrificed nearly a year of real life to this, so referring to us as "a bunch of people getting bored" is condescending and insensitive.</p>

        <p>Sorry, but that's simply untrue. 75% of jobs in the US cannot be done from home. Just because 12-year-olds can accomplish everything they need to do in life from the comfort of their beds, doesn't mean that the world works that way. Your food, water, electricity, gas, cable, and other necessities don't just materialize on your porch when you click your mouse. They require people to create, produce, refine, retool, connect, package, transport, stock, re-package and re-transport them to your location.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the lecture great superior old lady. I guess you are right with the thing about money since the government won't give us stimulus checks but that's no excuse to go into a store without a mask or hang out with your friends without a mask is it? This post started on a dude asking his friends why they arnt wearing a mask. People are dieing because they won't do what they can. If you can't stay home then go out but wear a mask too.</p>

        <p>We can't eat money. If our furnace breaks, and the company that manufactures furnaces is shut down, and the HVAC tech who installs furnaces is Staying Home and Staying Safe, burning money won't heat our home. We're not all rich folks living in mansions with a room full of supplies. We need normal life back. Kids in school, stores and factories up and running, everything back to full capacity. </p>
<p>As to the point of the post: wear a mask if you want, don't wear it if you want. Cloth doesn't stop an airborne virus. If I were to test positive tomorrow, they wouldn't hand me a mask and tell me to wear it when I'm out in public. They aren't letting family members visit folks in nursing homes as long as they're wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>You'll need to provide proof of your claim. The only studies that I've read that support mask use by healthy people were done in small groups in healthcare settings, using standard medical-grade PPE. </p>
<p>There has not been a single study that proves that non-health-care workers who aren't trained in proper PPE safety procedures using just any old piece of cloth they have at hand to cover their faces has decreased the spread of ANY virus. That's the only evidence I can accept for the claim that "masks protect us from COVID."</p>

        <p>I'll try my best to explain. It's mainly to protect others from you, when you cough little partials of water go out of your mouth and hang around. It spreads when others breathe it in. What the mask (old peice of cloth) can do is make it so instead of hanging around, they are stopped by the cloth barrier. This dosnt always work and thats why the 6 feet rule exists. When you cough it can go up to 6 feet. The masks might not be perfect, but its like going out for a walk with and without a knife, you wouldn't always get jumped, but bringing one makes it so if you do you are protected. And guess what? A knife isn't the best weapon the world and you can get robbed still if carrying a knife. Will you carry a knife or no? Make the same decision with a mask. Please.</p>

        <p>So as long as I'm not coughing droplets, I'm good. </p>
<p>Nope. The virus <strong>can</strong> travel that way, but it largely spreads as infected people breathe and it hangs in the air. That's called airborne spread, and for months the "experts" insisted that it didn't spread that way, that it was limited to droplets. </p>
<p>If you aren't wearing an N95 mask and you're infected, you're exhaling it above the cloth mask (where it's fogging up your glasses), past the sides of your mask, and you're forcing it through the fabric as you exhale. If I'm wearing a mask and I go indoors where infected people are, as long as I can breathe, I can inhale viral particles. </p>
<p>The places that have dropped mask mandates have not experienced a larger surge than places that have not.</p>

        <p>It still dose something. Your telling me that a cloth mask over out face dosnt do anything? You say experts in quotation marks as they know less than you. If they say to wear a mask then do it. Even if it dosnt do anything it still makes people feel better. God for example. I dont go around with evidence about how God dosnt exist. Why? Because it helps people out of depression and so on. The reality is that everyone that isn't you thinks your dumb. They arnt sheep like your friend told you. They arnt trolls. They arnt all leftists either. So wear a mask or ill start providing evidence that God dosnt exist to everyone using him a copeing method okay?</p>

        <p>No. It doesn't do anything. Places that have no mask mandate are not doing any worse than places with them. People who wear them catch it. People who wear them spread it. These are facts, like it or not. </p>
<p>I am not in the habit of allowing strangers to instruct me on how to live my life, so, no, I will not be blindly obeying people who cannot prove the advice they're peddling. I'll never tell someone that they must uncover around me, since I believe that grown people are able to decide for themselves what risks they're willing to take in life. I'll choose my own clothing (and the places I go, the things I do, and the people I gather with), thank you very much. </p>
<p>The reality is that most people in this country think that day-to-day life shouldn't be lived under the thumb of an authoritarian government. Our constitution wasn't written with a public health clause.</p>
