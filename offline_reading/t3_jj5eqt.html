    <strong>Why’s everyone get mad when a business makes you wear a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve seen people comment here. I’ve checked profiles. A large % post in either conservative subs, or even more often r/conspiracy. </p>
<p>If you guys are (mostly) conservative, then why are you all of the sudden mad about businesses requiring mask? I though private property = their decision who to serve. Last I recall it was conservatives defending a cake shop’s right to not sell to a gay couple (which I personally agree with. Do what you want, sell to who you want). But now that it’s something YOU disagree with, it’s bullshit and you won’t do it?</p>
<p>You go into stores with the mask on and immediately take it off? Seems entirely hypocritical.</p></p>

        <p>Not sure where your drawing the political affiliation conclusion from, but individual businesses should be able to make the decision whether or not to mandate masks. The issue is that they are not given this opportunity; they are forced to enforce mask mandates by the government in order to stay open.</p>

        <p>I'm not mad at mom and pop businesses. If they want you to wear a mask that's their right. But they shouldn't be forced to ask people to wear a mask for fear of getting fined. The government shouldn't mandate masks. If independent businesses want you to wear them that should be completely up to them, and it isn't right now (where I live).</p>

        <p>I don't understand why you assumes everyone here are conservatives. I'm far left and normally a Bernie Sanders supporter. I'm just a lockdown skeptical in additional to that.</p>
<p>I think it's wrong of governments to mandate them. If businesses voluntarily mandated them without governmental interventions, it would've been different. Then businesses had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do and customers could choose which business to support or boycott. If a business was ableist, you could just choose to boycott them without getting punished. As long they were voluntarily, there will be different kinds of business policies. That would mean some stores with masks and some without. If government mandates them, the same rules applies everywhere and there's less freedom of choice.</p>

<p>False. Here's the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-mask">data</a>. Let's consider why you reject that data.</p>
<p>&rt; demonize anybody who doesn't </p>
<p>When a person doesn't contribute to helping make society better (in any manner), that person gets called out as someone who doesn't contribute to making society better, especially when it's a relatively simple task.</p>

        <p>Sorry I asked for empirical evidence not a health line article.  Can you link me an actual scientific study that definitively says masks are a good enough preventative measure to trap virus particles that are smaller than the woven fabric?  You won't find them because they don't exist.  Or how wearing them to the point where they become filled with mucus and/or sweat that then precipitates people touching them and counteracting whatever positive benefits makes sense?  I believe the article you linked mentions those drawbacks.</p>
<p>They capture respiratory droplets, but the virus is apparently airborne.  They may do 'something' - but exactly what is not clear and is definitely not evident enough for idiots to go around blaming everyone they see without one for the spread of the virus.  Your avatar is cute though.</p>
<p>I don't trust the liberal media.  Who the fuck would?  You just implicitly acknowledged there's a bias.  I do my own truth mining.</p>
<p>Do you work, or are you on social assistance or live with mom and dad?  These things are important when you're weighing in on decisions and responses to this 'pandemic' that affect people's lives and livelihoods.  You can understand why people who have had their lives ruined and are no longer buying the government's narrative would be resistant to wearing a piece of cloth that has not been scientifically shown to be effective and was advised against in the beginning by the same people saying to wear one.</p>

<p>&rt; You just implicitly acknowledged there's a bias.  </p>
<p>I have never denied bias. There is bias in everything. The key is being able to identify strong vs weak bias, which is something that hasn't been taught in school systems for decades. I do my own "truth mining" as well, and it's clear that listening to the experts in whatever given field is the best way to form an opinion on any given subject. So please, help me understand why you don't trust the experts in the fields of immunology and virology. Do you reject science overall? Or just bits and pieces to suit your own bias and preferred narrative?</p>
<p>&rt;Do you work, or are you on social assistance or live with mom and dad? These things are important when you're weighing in on decisions and responses to this 'pandemic' that affect people's lives and livelihoods. </p>
<p>I am fortunate enough to be a partner in a company that is thriving in my sector of business and am having my best year out of the last four. The pandemic has been good for my business, my income, and for the safety of my family. Nevertheless, I am able to recognize that what may be fantastic for my bank account still leaves me concerned for the well-being of everyone else in our society who may not be in as fortunate of a situation as I am. I don't live with my parents, but I sure as hell would love for my kids to be able to safely see their grandparents in person again.</p>
<p>&rt;You can understand why people who have had their lives ruined and are no longer buying the government's narrative </p>
<p>The Government ruining lives? Careful! This sounds like a mentality of not taking responsibility for your own actions. That sounds like something the right considers to be "leftist."</p>

        <p>Yes, just like the flu is the responsibility of people's actions and not just a contagious virus that we have to deal with as part of being alive.  I will point that your research paper does not explicitly or plainly say that masks work as you've put it, but that there is evidence suggesting that they do.  But there are also many considerations: '<em>While it is always difficult to establish cause and effect at the community level</em>, there is now strong evidence that public masking can slow or even stop the spread COVID-19 in states and countries4,7,11,13,16,44,57.'</p>
<p>Like I said, i don't disagree with wearing them.  What i disagree with and what you clearly exhibit is a tendency to believe you can identify who is responsible for this state of affairs based on what someone's wearing on their face and the supposed irresponsible behaviour of certain people...that just happen to fall under one political spectrum. You are never going to stop the spread of this virus, this is no one's fault.  Unless you want the government to take Draconian measures a la China.  You can't enforce crowd control for 100's of millions of people and ask them to always be on their guard and resist basic human impulses.</p>
<p>Sorry for the ad hominem attack.  Glad for your success.  I took you to be a child for your sweeping generalizations of people.  But the video you later posted made me realize you're coming from political motivations.</p>

        <p>My guy, you just said that he won’t find empirical evidence because “it doesn’t exist”. He found it and posted it, and I’ve found plenty too. You definitely were originally stating they don’t work. And then when he links proof showing they do work, you say you’re not against wearing them?</p>
<p>It’s not political. They’re proven to work. Meaning they’re proven to reduce spread. Meaning less people will die. Meaning anyone who doesn’t use one (something that is incredibly easy to do), deservedly gets publicly shamed. That’d be like saying “hey America, we could stop 215,000 people from dying this year if everyone made sure to wear socks! Even if some of you don’t like wearing shoes, and find socks and sandals uncomfortable, we ask you to do so anyways because it’ll save lives!” And then you basically say “nahhhhh”. Yeah, of course anyone who sees you not wearing a piece of cloth will look down on you. </p>
<p>There is plenty more evidence than just the one he linked. You can find quite a few of these studies that all repeat the same thing. It astounds me how people are anti-science just for the sake of wanting to stand out and not come across as “a government shill” to their weird conspiracist friends.</p>
