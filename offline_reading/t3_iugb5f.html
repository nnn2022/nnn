        <p>I haven't been inside any business, store, etc. that requires me to wear a mask. I found alternatives to those that choose to partake in the nonsense. I will continue to do this for as long as its necessary. Thankfully, I live in an area where many small business owners feel the same way I, and many others, feel about the mask tyranny. </p>
<p>My wife, however, is a little more mask tolerant than I am. Its not that she agrees that masks should be worn, she is a doctor, so she is used to wearing them. She knows, better than most, what masks can and cannot do. I think she is one of those people that just doesn't want to deal with the hassle that comes with not wearing one every so often. I told her that is a part of the probelm but, that's an issue for another day.</p>
<p>She met some friends for lunch at a restaurant a few days ago. When they walked into the place the hostess told the group they had to wear their masks until they sat down at their table. Once seated, they were allowed to remove them. However, if they had to go to the bathroom, they would have to put the mask back on. Once inside the restroom stall, the mask could come off. It would have be put back on before exiting the stall and kept on for the walk back to the table, where, once seated, it could be taken off again.</p>
<p>I honestly don't understand how full grown human adults are able to call this type of thing science based and/or effective. I'm supposed to believe that I can only get sick between the entrance and the table, on the walk from the table to the bathroom, in the space between the door to the bathroom and the stall and on the walk back to the table? Not only that, if I were to follow the exact mask on, mask off rules this particular restaurant has, assuming I only have to use the bathroom one time, I would end up touching the mask 7 or 8 times, pulling it off and putting it back on. And, a couple of those times would be just after using the bathroom and touching various surfaces in and around a public restroom. Granted, I would wash my hands but, there is no guarantee that my hands would be completely germ and bacteria free after doing so.</p>
<p>I am not anti mask or pro mask. If people want to wear masks, great, wear the masks. I just don't want to, ever. And, until someone comes out and tells us that this mask or that mask, made of this specific kind of material and worn this exact way, at all times, it is impossible for me to believe there is any actual science behind wearing one. The simple fact that we have been told you have to wear one here but, you don't have to wear one there, is enough to prove to me its all a bunch of horseshit. </p>
<p>If we were actually in the middle of the worst pandemic in history and masks would protect us from getting sick and getting each other sick, there would be complete consistency across the board. There would be no exceptions. Every single person would've been told exactly what kind of mask to wear, what kind of material the mask had to be made of and how and when to wear it. The directives and requirements would've made sense. Nothing we have directed to do has made much sense, since this whole mess started.</p>

<p>now heâ€™s doing virtual learning in a daycare - masks required.</p>
<p>BUT the state mandate says kids under ten arenâ€™t required to wear masks in public spaces. My son is six.</p>

        <p>My wife is a teacher and their school is doing a system where you only take 2 classes at a time for a few weeks until you've completed all 10 periods. </p>
<p>The students are all together in one room for 160 mins in the morning (forced to wear masks), and then when the bell rings for lunch, they can all take of their masks for the lunch hour.</p>

        <p>Probably because most restaurants seat you more than 6 feet away from another table of people, but it's really hard to social distance at school surrounded by teachers and other kids all day.</p>
