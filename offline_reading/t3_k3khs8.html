    <strong>What will happen to those who refuse to get vaccinated if it becomes mandated?</strong>
    <p><p>Whether it's mandated by the government and/or corporations for employment and receiving services I think the following scenarios may occur...</p>
<p>Those who get vaccinated and happen to survive for the immediate future will become targets for crime given their virtual monopoly on obtaining resources. I can see desperate people forced out of the economy robbing grocery stores and civilians alike, necessitating further militarization of society with armed guards outside of Walmarts and Coscos, a chunk of the population put into an artificial famine by inovert force which will cause them to act out in a volatile fashion. It's possible these people who'll refuse to be vaccinated, whether for health preservation or religious/philosophical reasons, may be rounded up and sent to quarantine/prison camps for being potentially contagious and suspected dissident terrorists alike. Might take a while to get to this point, but I believe it's possible. </p>
<p>On the flip side, those vaccinated, even if left ostensibly unharmed by the vaccine for the time being, will nonetheless be subjugated into participating in an ultra-slavish society of relentless government monitoring coopted by policing through soulless corporations. Immunity passports will become a necessity, which will likely need frequent updating with new vaccine uptake that'll  be linked to a social credit score and NWO crypto currency. And to add insult to injury, they'll probably be forced to wear masks anyway on the off chance of vaccine failure. Plus, if they survive being repeatedly vaccinated with this never before seen mRNA type of vaccine, they may  suffer long term health problems or become carriers of birth defects like with what happened with thalidomide. </p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it's gonna be a lose lose situation no matter your choice. You'll likely either die from being ostracized by society for refusing to become a GMO slave, or if injected with this so-called vaccine, you may die or gravely suffer from an adverse reaction or you'll die a death of a thousands cuts if you so choose to become tagged and tracked cattle constantly being monitored "for your health", and prodded for any sign of dissent. Maybe a parallel society can emerge away from this technocratic Hell on earth, but it'll be hard won in that case, and most people seem too cowardly and ill-equipped to throw off the Bread and Circuses to start anew.</p></p>

        <p>What will happen? You just won't be allowed to participate in society anymore. They're using these lockdowns to choke out all of the smaller brick and mortar businesses and by the end of this, the only thing remaining will be the big giant corporations like Wal-mart, where they can easily implement their "no vaccine, no entry" policy into. </p>
<p>A lot of people think the vaccine will be "forced". It won't be forced, they're going to make it so living in society is impossible without it. No travel, no buying food, no paying your bills, no nothing unless you get it. There's already small blips of this already being rolled out. </p>
<p>Me personally? I don't even care if I starve to death because I'm not getting it no matter what. I truly believe this is a spiritual battle and taking this DNA modifying vaccine has a non-physical consequence to it.</p>

        <p>Nail on the head. I feel positive tho, so many people will be hesitant to take it, and the goal of the 1% is to try and get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible so people don’t see long term effects. Just think of how many parents will be hesitant to give it to their children, or how many nurses/doctors will be hesitant to take it. That will be the REAL showing of where humanity goes</p>

        <p>The way that I imagine it is that they won't make vaccines mandatory or even someone won't hold you down to vaccinate anyone, it would simply be that they won't allow you to be a member of society without one (can't work, go to the store, etc)</p>

        <p>I think there will be just a huge black market economy for “vaccine proof”. Think about it. There’s a huge black market for fake IDs for example, for something as relatively harmless as going to a bar when you’re 18 rather than 21 in the US. I see proof of the vaccine being treated honestly the same way, the black market will flourish but enforcement will be relatively lax. </p>
<p>The reason being that there are a lot of VERY mainstream people, even those who DO agree to masking and social distancing, who are questioning, hesitant, or outright refusing to get the vaccine. Private industries may mandate it- but this is with them thinking right now that anti vaccine is a fringe group. Anti-vaccine people in GENERAL may be a fringe group, but anti THIS vaccine people are plentiful and varied. It’s very likely anyone above lower middle class will refuse it, and find some kind of workaround, whether the local schools agree to stay quiet, theme parks or airlines allow “good faith” systems like simply checking a box on a form, private employers at the location level don’t enforce for their employees even if the larger company does, etc. </p>
<p>Most likely to be forced into taking the vaccine are poor, undocumented, incaercerated, and uneducated people who can be scared into doing it because they have no safety net and tricked into thinking they need it.</p>

        <p>Your optimist too much so. It may start out relatively easy to get away with not getting the vaccine and the poor and uneducated may have to go first but they want everyone and I mean everyone vaccinated. It will just keep getting worse and worse until everyone has to get it or be out on the street. Also so many weak people will just get it despite knowing better and try to drag other down with them because of tall poppy syndrome. My mother got me vaccinated again h1n1 despite knowing is wasn't anything special because it was "convent" and if I was still a kid I would be be in line now for this new vaccine too even though she knows its untested and was pushed out in less then year. Degusting isn't it? People will sell their children out for convince.  Better prepare now.</p>

        <p>For me since I work in schools I fully expect to face the choice of mandatory vaccination or quit.</p>
<p>And I will be quitting if given that choice. I already came to terms with that months ago when it was obvious back then what would be coming.</p>
<p>I honestly don't think regular stores will force proof. I think that's just way too much. Maybe I'm being naive though. I'm a season pass holder for Knott's. I don't expect I'll ever see the inside of that park again in my life. You'll have to have proof for air travel I'm sure. Especially out of country travel. No more concerts or games which is depressing but I'll deal. </p>
<p>There will be doctors willing to take a bribe or black market passes though. I'm sure there will be. And I'll try for that. Finally, growing up in a literal drug den barrio and having family that knows seemingly everyone in town and everything going on may come in handy! And I'm genuinely being serious about that.</p>

        <p>They aren’t going to mandate the vaccine for everyone. It will be handled like most other vaccines IMO. Many employers will require it (some already require flu), colleges/universities certainly will. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities certainly will (for residents and employees). It will eventually be required for children in school (as other vaccines are now)- and some states are more lenient with exemptions than others. I could definitely see it being required for travel, sports, and certain places with memberships (gyms etc)...these are all very easy to track so it will be worth their while to require it (from their perspective). Large events like concerts and sports events...who knows? Probably will- tickets are generally bought in advance- plenty of time to wait on verification. But general shopping and restaurants etc? No. Those who are self employed or working for certain employers- especially smaller businesses? No. Many will not require it. </p>
<p>Many people will be able to avoid the vaccine for quite some time. Forever, in some cases. Many people live quite simple lives, really. Most will eventually give in and get the vaccine IF no major side effects are reported, as they decide to travel, attend a large event, take a new job etc. it will catch up with most.</p>

        <p>The way it can happen in shops and restaurants is with these new health passports they are developing,  scan your health pass at the door or don't get access. Of course later on it'll be much simpler, when we have no cash it'll be: no vaccine? Your accounts have been frozen.</p>
<p>My gut feeling is that privately owned shops and restaurants won't want to implement this but what choice will they have when governments offer them a "relief cheque" on the condition that they do this.</p>
<p>The vaccine doesn't need to be forced, it can be bribed and extorted into practice</p>

        <p>I think they'll say that the non-vaccinated people have to keep wearing masks in public places, which may serve as an "incentive" to get the vaccine. I hate masks, but I would probably keep wearing one because I think the untested vaccine is scarier.</p>
