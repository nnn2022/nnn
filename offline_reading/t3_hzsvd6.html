        <p>Just the thought of masks being permanent makes me so depressed. And even if they someday lift the ban I’ll know that they can bring them back any time. Just like they can lock us down again at anytime and take away all our rights.</p>

        <p>I was kidnapped by a stranger and very nearly lost my life. Just randomly taken when walking down a street. I saw him behind me for a moment before he was on top of me, his face masked by a bandana type thing so I couldn't assess anything about his expression - not receiving that perceptual/sensory information is a big deal and disorienting, a massive part of communication and being human which is being ignored by those who say it's <em>just</em> a mask. He took me, held me captive for a period of time, before almost strangling me to death.  He also played with suffocation during my assault.</p>
<p>You just worry it will happen again, forever more that worry exists. We don't have masks here (yet, and I will not cope if our premier forces them) but the worst part is that those who cannot wear one (i could not) are being harassed, attacked, labelled as horrible things, discriminated against freely, and traumatised by other people and officials. Everyone has turned against them and many of those not wearing masks are not just those against them but also those vulnerable for various reasons. It's suddenly okay to discriminate, attack, bully, even physically intimidate those who don't have a mask on.</p>
<p>If masks have been forced once, they can absolutely be forced again. Or forever, at least every flu season. Governments now know that they can force just about anything on people, take anything away, put us under house arrest and we will follow orders blindly so long as you create some sort of threat or fear...</p>

        <p>I'm seeing friends post hate against those not wearing masks even local friends who don't wear masks since no one really does here. I commented on one of my American friend's posts, a friend I am very close to, very nicely that there are legitimate reasons people aren't wearing a mask that go beyond not wanting to <em>(which is also a legit reason since they are not supported by high level evidence but I didn't mention this as they like most others think there's some amazing scientific evidence behind them and a consensus among experts)</em> and that I am one person who if I lived there would be out not wearing a mask simply because I cannot. I cannot have anything over my face, touching my face, nothing.</p>
<p>Her reply was exactly this <em>"well if you "can't" wear a mask just wait until you're wearing a ventilator, you deserve it like everyone else who is stupid and selfish"</em></p>
<p>To which I replied asking if she had forgotten that it was my mental health that almost killed me and left me on a ventilator? That my family were given the talk that my chances of survival were slim? Yeah it's my MH made worse by these choices and by how people are behaving and treating others that's most likely at this point to have me end up on a vent or dead, not a virus that poses barely any threat to us.</p>

        <p>This is one thing I was nervous about with these mask mandates is that they'd be permanent and a "new normal". I'm hoping this doesn't have a domino effect.</p>
<p>Also, the article said that masks were "the best vaccine". I think I know where this could be going.</p>

        <p>I’m thinking that’s what it could take to “repeal” the mask mandate. It could just get replaced with vaccine. I think a mandatory vaccine will have more resistance.</p>

        <p>One thing that may become permanent is the chosen ritual or strapping a mask to the face.  It will always be what it is now, a choice and nothing more.  The only thing guaranteed to be permanent is the existence of those of us who refuse to comply with tyranny.</p>

        <p>I don't doubt sheep are too addicted to feeling like virtuous heros to all demask.  If they did that, it would take actual work and effort to be truly considerate.  Why bother when strapping a McDonald napkin, some underwear, or damn near anything on transforms an ordinary bloke into jesus?  However,  maskless free thinkers are also here to stay.</p>

        <p>This has been my gut fear since hearing about masks being mandated.  I can't explain it, just had a feeling deep down something is wrong forcing people to wear a mask.  If you want to wear one, fine.  Do so.  If you are so scared to leave your house without one, stay home.  But don't force others to do so if they so choose.  Our freedoms and humanities are being stripped away little by little willingly.  Do not get me wrong, I own a mask and will wear one where I feel it is warranted (close quarters, if I feel ill, around those at risk, etc.), but forcing it just really sits on the wrong side of me for some reason.

        <p>Its funny how most people I know in real life think this way.</p>
<p>Then you go on r/coronavirus and they are going batshit crazy and will kill to get vaccinated first. </p>
<p>Im not sure what represents the majority, but I expect there will be huge backlash when they mandate the vaccine</p>

        <p>I think it will start with big tech/healthcare companies mandating it for their employees. Then virtue signaling Fortune 500 companies. Then these tech companies and others will say “if your employees aren’t vaccinated we won’t do business with you” </p>
<p>And then it’s over, the government won’t even have to.</p>

        <p>They are not laws they are executive orders, realistically EOs can only be in for a certain amount of time before they are forced toe expire, but if no one comes up to enforce such then the EO can go on as long as they want it.</p>

        <p>Masks aren't here yet... I won't cope if they are forced here. I don't want to live in a world of masks. People look intimidating and are anxiety inducing. Disorienting and scary not seeing faces and receiving the vital expressions and micro expressions for communication. At a personal level it hits right at my trauma.</p>
