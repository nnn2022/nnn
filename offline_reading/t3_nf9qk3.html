    <strong>If the masks and vaccines are about control, then why is it a worldwide thing?</strong>
    <p><p>Did every country and government in the world decide to encourage/make people wear masks and get the vaccine for power? Legitimately curious.</p></p>

        <p>Let's not forget every country was offered a hell of a lot of money for "covid relief". This came with caveats such as lockdowns, masks etc. Belarus president came out publicly saying he refused to accept close to a billion from IMF as it was bribery. Of course this wasn't covered in mainstream media. </p>
<p>So don't be fooled. Every leader who stands up and defends this tyranny personally has a vested financial interest in this. That goes for the "scientific advisors" who are also heavily funded by b and m Gates foundation etc. 
The conflicts of interest is staggering and the fact that isn't being highlighted is proof that there is shady shit going on, if you actually believed the rest of the nonsense.</p>

        <p>It can be hard for people naive to the anatomy of the global power structure to fathom just how staggeringly disproportionate the power distribution among humans is. It’s hard to comprehend how much power certain people wield, for the same reason it is difficult to comprehend how many stars are in the Milky Way.</p>

        <p>Well, not Belarus.  The UN offered the Belarussian president $1B Euros to do the covid/mask thing and he declined.  Belarus did absolutely nothing: no masks, no social distancing.  Its not strictly speaking "for power", its for depopulation.</p>

        <p>Probably.</p>
<p>But even if it isn't a worldwide planned scam, the behaviours can be explained globally from local actions.</p>
<p>I.e. when birds fly or fish swim in formation, no animal is communicating globally to the thousands of others. They are all using local "rules" of their immediate environment to move.</p>
<p>When an observer sees this from afar it looks hive-mind made, but it isn't.</p>
<p>Humans through history have shown the same patterns in how our societies function and ideologies. </p>
<p>Trends and ideologies always sweep worldwide,or the size of the known world in history. This is nothing new. And by definition a pandemic is global, of course there's going to be the same response.</p>

        <p>Sweden didn’t play the game but a lot of other countries did. It’s about power when the Flu is more dangerous than the Plandemic. The media decided to turn this into a propaganda campaign where politicians are damned if they don’t play along then yes it is about control. </p>
<p>The few politicians who decided to not play are ridiculed and named called in an attempt to control and bring them back in line. This is 100% about controlling people, elections and government. Hey let’s give the people $1200 a month to keep them at home during the “trying times”. It’s called quite money. </p>
<p>Free money is why the Doomers don’t want to open up. Take the free money away and let’s see how long they care about grandma and grandpa.</p>

        <p>"Did every country and government in the world"</p>
<p>Source? Some countries didn't and the media just ignores them. It's interesting to see the focus on India for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>No one gives a fuck about India. This country has been fucked sideways for hundreds of years. No one cares. A lot of regular horrible shit that happens there is not even considered newsworthy most of the time.</li>
<li>India has laws and jail time for folks who disobey the rules.</li>
<li>It comes at the same time as the vaccine program.</li>
<li>There are countries much worse off than India, including most of Europe and the US, but the media makes India out as the be all and end all of catastrophes. </li>
</ol>
<p>But the basic premise of your question is kind of odd:</p>
<p>\&rt;If the masks and vaccines are about control, then why is it a worldwide thing?</p>
<p>If business is about making money, why do all businesses try to make money? Gotcha! </p>
<p>Why would you consider this to be a gotcha?</p>

        <p>It is not that every country is doing this, or decided to do this at a whim. </p>
<p>There are people behind the scenes controlling several countries major countries (re: western democracies), and they are the one's calling the shots. There were several posts within the last few months that made similar questions, and at least for the United States, Biden is NOT running the show. He is just a front man, a puppet, and he is being controlled by handlers who tell him what to say, and policies to set. Same thing with Boris Johnson of the U.K., he's just a front man, the real people calling the shots are the technocrats.</p>
<p>There people behind the scenes that we do not know about, a small group of people who control the world (call them TPTB), the order of things went like this like as follows; they called the orange man, Trump, to be removed from power, because he was not supposed to get elected in 2016, Hilliary was supposed to get elected. However, his win shocked the world, including the TPTB, so from the moment he won, there was a campaign to get rid of him.</p>
<p>Now, whether you like him or not, it is irrelevant, the fact that he was a nationalist/populist president is what pissed the TPTB off. So, the TPTB cooked up a plan to get rid him, and they tried with Russian Collusion, impeachments, and then they found their "magic bullet" which was a "pandemic" and "mail-in ballots." If you can convince the leadership in several major nations to go along with a "pandemic" then the benefits for the governments (more power), the smaller and weaker nations will follow suit. Why? Because they do not want their economies to be destroyed. They were most likely told, again all behind the scenes, go along with it, or see your countries destroyed economically. </p>
<p>If you look at what happened, Trump lost, and isn't it a coincidence that the rates of people getting sick, at least here in the United States has gone down considerably? Think about that! Of course, this is just a theory, but I am willing to bet these countries going along with the scam are getting something in return, at least the leadership are, we just don't know about it because it is being hidden from us.</p>
