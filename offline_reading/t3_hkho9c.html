        <p>How the fuck is only living on campus every other semester supposed to work? People expected to sublease apartments to other students, or traditional students expected to just head home and 100% remote half the year?</p>

        <p>Beats me. Almost all of this is nearly impossible to enforce. Plus CT itself has some of the most absurd US-internal travel restrictions and from my interpretation of weasel-word-loaded admin speak, it seems as though Yale will go even further. Weekly virus testing? Right. Mandatory contact tracing training for all "community members"--creepy; these are the supposed future leaders of the, um, kind of free? world. Plus it is absolutely absurd to expect graduate students in particular (who tend to be broke as shit) to move constantly--you're correct in pointing out the absolute absurdity and unfeasibility of all of this. </p>
<p>In the words of some guy from the future, eventually a group of wealthy alumni is going to have to step up and say "the line must be drawn here, here and no further!"</p>

        <p>Read the whole damned thing. Many links to preposterous policies included. I grew quickly disillusioned with Yale during my time as a graduate student there; this sounds like a living hell. Even Washington U in St. Louis, my undergrad alma mater, isn't being quite this insane, but never underestimate how moronic most Ivy League administrators are. It's a shame, because they have a man of reason in their School of Public Health, who I'm sure was not consulted for these "extensive" (their words) guidelines.</p>

        <p>Thank God I’m past college years (by far). Had this happened to me, I would’ve been damn near depressed as I enjoyed the on campus experience so much. I would’ve dropped out and just fell back on manual labor. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. But back then I would’ve been able to just survive by busting my ass and putting my young body through hell.</p>

        <p>Thats either in permatemp or gig economy. Permanent good paying jobs are gone forever unless you are well connected.</p>

        <p>And even Ivy League alumni are not as connected as one might think; at least not anymore. I can tell you that having that school on my CV has hurt me in the job market more than helped me, despite hard work, excellent grades, and glowing recs from full professors. There is a reason I bailed before finishing my PhD, and that was in 2011. Part of attending undergrad at an elite school is making those connections; hard to do when you can't grab a beer with your advisor and JPM and Goldman are no longer recruiting on campus but over video conference.   </p>
<p>Honestly, I feel bad for these kids--most of them are not rich brats from my recollection as a graduate assistant, many are extremely bright hard workers who are not snowflakes and are there on scholarship (which even for most upper-middle class families is not enough at this point). I'm realizing how fortunate I was to finish undergrad in the mid-aughts and be done with academe by 2011.</p>

        <p>And lots of Zoomers with unbearable student debt...as if the shat-upon Millennials and youngest of the Gen Xers aren't saddled with enough. Going to graduate school on a full fellowship at a Yale/Duke/Stanford/Northwestern type of school is one thing (although good luck finding a job, even with a hard sciences PhD, with what will happen to them even at these richly endowed institutions); undergrad at an Ivy/comparable private university/college simply is not worth it in the least if you're stuck moving around, contact tracing and snitching on your classmates and professors, and taking courses over Zoom/whatever the hell they use. Note how Yale is <em>not</em> offering any kind of tuition discount for what amounts to be maybe half of a Yale AB. Ridiculous.</p>
