        <p>This is a common strategy. I’d like to think that well over 50% of the population wouldn’t be on board for this, which means our representative government isn’t representing the people’s interests. When that happens the only way to defend a free nation is remove those fools.</p>

<p>I think it's too late in many cases. They're already pushing this stuff through while, like /u/kaibasus wrote, people are arguing over masks and politics.</p>

        <p>Every action has an equal but opposite reaction. There is a lot of force pushing in 1 direction. That force is money. If enough people work together to push back (I know, I’m asking a lot), the people should be able to push back.</p>
<p>In some ways I see the mask argument as a distraction, sometimes I see it as the first foothold people needed to start fighting back against larger issues. The trick being not allowing that foothold to get misdirected, a shill specialty.</p>

        <p>I feel like I'm crazy for seeing the CCP's fingers all over this virus response stuff, pulling and promoting crap like support for lockdowns, mandatory masks out of fear and social credit to boost their cultural/political image at best and to damage the West socially and economically to their benefit in an atrempt at dominance at worst.  Personally I think the White House may be seeing this too and it might be one reason for them stepping up their rhetoric ans policies on China in the past week or two.</p>

<p>Lethal to those over 70 in nursing homes with serious comorbidities.  Everyone else?  Not so much.  Yes of course there is a statistical risk in younger, healthier demographics, but if you look at the rates (not just the raw counts that the media is happy to frighten you with while ignoring the denominators) you'll see that the risk is quite low.</p>

        <p>Ey I'm actually arguing with someone else in here about the age of lethality for covid.  It actually ramps up at 45, not 70.  No nursing home or comorbidity requirement.</p>
<p>And man this sub had a front page post about my side disrespecting the elderly, but completely disregarding the elderly is being one of the most common arguments I'm running into on here.</p>
<p>We're talking about if you have the virus, should you be allowed to enter a crowded stadium?  And this sub is like...yeah sounds like a good idea to me.</p>

        <p>Regarding the elderly, it might have helped if "your side" didn't mandate that nursing homes accept covid+ patients.</p>
<p>Anyway, the risk among lower age groups is still contingent upon comorbidities, including in particular obesity.  Of course, next you'll likely tell me that I don't care about obese people, but I could turn around and ask you:  do you not care about the cancer patients who have deferred treatment due to lockdown, or the suicides caused by lockdown, etc.?  "Your side" is willing to sacrifice all those individuals, as well as the economy (which correspond to livelihoods of real people), in order to lower risk to segments of the population who were already at higher risk for mortality.  </p>
<p>The reality is that the risk in these groups is being used to create fear and hysteria, which in turn is being used to usher in an agenda that existed long before the covid pandemic.  This agenda -- and I'll make my point very clear in addressing your claim of a "strawman" -- is to create a totalitarian system of control like that of CCP, the elements of which are clearly evident in health passport systems that have obviously been in development long before covid.</p>

<p>Comorbidities increase the fatality rate, they are not required for it to be fatal.</p>
<p>&rt;Of course, next you'll likely tell me that I don't care about obese people, but I could turn around and ask you</p>
<p>I mean you could make the fallacy of "this isn't wrong, because this other thing is wrong".  Besides obesity another common comorbidity is high blood pressure, which is also crazy prevalent in the US.</p>
<p>&rt;do you not care about the cancer patients who have deferred treatment due to lockdown</p>
<p>I'd need evidence that this is the case.  And the context if it is, is it like, there's literally not enough time or resources to save all these cancer patients and these people dying from covid?  And, let me just repeat this</p>
<p><strong>We're talking about if you have the virus, should you be allowed to enter a crowded stadium? </strong></p>
<p>is this the kind of thing that's gonna take away resources from helping people with cancer as tons more people contract covid?  Because people thought it would be a good idea to let people with coronavirus into crowded events, to stick it to the CCP in a made up comparison because there's red yellow and green?</p>
<p>&rt;This agenda -- and I'll make my point very clear in addressing your claim of a "strawman"</p>
<p>Just because you make the strawman clear doesnt mean it's not a strawman.</p>
<p>I saw the suicide post on here yesterday too.  Notably, there weren't any numbers provided.  It was one guy in a hospital, that the hospital itself disagreed with.  It was just a baseless reddit title of there's more suicides than covid deaths.  </p>
<p>Do you think New Zealand, South Korea, or any other country that properly contained this virus is struggling with not being able to treat cancer patients due to coronavirus volume, or dealing with a spike in suicides?  You think letting it be just perfectly fine for coronavirus positive people to go to crowded events will help cancer patients somehow?</p>

<p>&rt; I'd need evidence that this is the case [cancer patients delaying treatment].</p>
<p>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/20/thousands-of-cancer-patients-could-die-early-due-to-coronavirus-delays-study-finds</p>
<p>Also, anecdotally, I have access to inside stakeholder information that confirms, yes, cancer patients are delaying treatment.</p>
<p>Regarding your stadium question, I'm relatively agnostic about large  public events.  I.e., I'm on the fence about whether prohibitions on large groups over, say 250, should be allowed at this time.  However, lockdown policy in many if not most areas of the US go far beyond large public events, essentially prohibiting gatherings among members of different households.  That is clearly overreach.</p>
<p>Regarding the strawman: I'm sorry if you can't see how 2+2=4, i.e. that lauding CCP response to coronavirus while simultaneously signing contracts for infrastructure that enables exactly the kind of intrusive control that is well-known in the CCP telegraphs an intention to implement such a system in the West.   Knowing that such a system would never be accepted without a marketing strategy, it becomes clear that covid is a ready-made excuse that can be made to justify all forms of government intrusion.</p>

<p>You havent taught anything about coronavirus.  Amongst the symptoms are a tendency to form blood clots in the lungs, which can and do kill regardless of comorbidities via any number of different embolisms.  </p>
<p>Your link and your claim are two different things.  And the link itself isnt evidence for anything, it's a prediction of the future that even the article itself seems to disprove </p>
<p><em>NHS England bosses told hospitals in March to continue cancer surgery even when they were shutting down much normal care to concentrate on treating Covid patients.</em></p>
<p>while the articles entire prediction is on the assumption NHS delays surgeries (a delay not based on anything)</p>
<p><em>Turnbull and colleagues used Public Health England (PHE) data on how delays to surgery of three and six months affect patients’ chances of still being alive five years later. They then applied that modelling to the 94,912 patients a year who undergo surgery in England to remove a cancerous growth.</em></p>
<p>Now, <strong>your</strong> claim is that the patients themselves are refusing treatment, or delaying it themselves.  At which point, what on earth do you want from me?  You'd need a new source for the claim for one.  And then...I dont even know, we shouldn't try to mitigate the spread of coronavirus because some cancer patients are refusing treatment?  I have no idea what the point is now.</p>

<p>this is another strawman.  Neither this proposed passport nor anywhere in this argument has the context been banning large gatherings.  The context is, hang on let me quote it again for emphasis</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>We're talking about if you have the virus, should you be allowed to enter a crowded stadium?</strong></p>
<p>'</p>
<p>&rt;infrastructure that enables exactly the kind of intrusive control that is well-known in the CCP</p>
<p>No, we're talking about infrastructure for coronavirus tracking.  And the <em>control</em> being you cant go to a crowded stadium for 2 weeks after testing positive for coronavirus.</p>
