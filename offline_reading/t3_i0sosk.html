    <strong>One of my doomer friends posted this, and it's really had me seeing red...</strong>
    <p><p>They said:</p>
<p>&rt; People insisting herd immunity will end COVID are really advocating herd thinning and just want the vulnerable to hurry up and die so they can go back to shopping at Target without a mask.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I just find this infuriating.  This is coming from someone who has also posted about how hard lockdown has been for them, and that they've barely been out of the house at all since March, and how they miss their old life.  And then they post this stuff.  I can't help but think that their attitude is the biggest problem, that they don't realize that they're part of the problem more than they are part of the solution.</p></p>

        <p>The truth will hit these people like a ton of bricks, and when it does... people like us WILL be there to help and pick up the pieces. We will be too busy helping people to say "I tried to warn you".</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, and not to start an internet slapfight, but I feel like I need to say, I will NOT help anybody now who's turned on me since this thing started.  I've been pushed to the back burner since March 1st, had my birthday alone (even tho I went to a 'secret party' a former friend threw for her own bithday in May, they told me they couldn't so much as stop by my house in June for mine), had people condescendingly tell me it must be 'something you messed up' when my UI was screwed up, had people try to 'explain' why my plans (going to another city for a week) were a bad idea for 'someone your age', and literally last week had a former friend say "Oh, I'll buy you a mask with your favorite band on it if you'll just wear it, that'll be nice, won't it?"  and then get pissed when I told her I'm not a child.</p>
<p>I no longer speak to anyone I knew before. I literally have 2 friends left, neither of them close ones.  </p>
<p>And I will NEVER help any of these people, whether or not the truth ever hits them.</p>
<p>Fuck them, all this has exposed is the shitty side of everybody.</p>

        <p>I know how you feel. I lost almost all my friends too. It started way before this thing though. It was the last nail in the coffin on our friendships. </p>
<p>Lost a lot of family too.. definitely not on good terms but I will tolerate them. I sense that things will never be the same between me and the family members who disrespected my freedoms and individual rights.</p>
<p>I started to view these people like they are already "dead". That's pretty fucking dark and probably not healthy but it really does feel that way when it seems like they have completely turned off their brain. I'm coming out of that mindset and carrying on. Shake the dust off your boots and head on down the road. </p>
<p>That is fucked up about your birthday. I don't really celebrate mine anymore but I did this year. My "friends" got pissed because I wanted to show them a 2minute UFO video and hear their thoughts/theories on it. They all just started trying to start argument with me. I just wanted to watch a video with my friends. :( I give up on them. I don't use a cellphone and I find it incredibly rude that they always are playing on their phone while I'm trying to hang out with them. I find it incredibly rude and disrepectful, so good riddance! We are older and did NOT grow up with cell phones.</p>
<p>Allow me to do the honors; HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY TO YOU! WE LIVE IN A ZOOOOO! HAPPY BERFFDAAAYY!!! <em>noisemaker/partyballoons</em> == CAAAKE FIGGHT!!!! ==</p>

        <p>I donâ€™t want to sound cliche but this is classic attention seeking behavior. Social Media harnesses this and intensifies this in people. Fb, Twitter, instagram shit even reddit isnâ€™t helping us all be mentally sound adults. She can get pity from the lockdowns and also shame people who  want to make their own choices.</p>

        <p>Sooo much attention seeking behavior.  Everyone on the doomer subs knows multiple people who've had it and barely survived.  Meanwhile I still have yet to meet a person IRL who even <em>knows</em> a person who had it.</p>
<p>I work with a guy who got sick a few weeks ago.  He was certain that he had covid.  "I thought i was going to die", he said.  <strong>He tested negative but that didn't dissuade him</strong>, he was sure he had it.  And this guy is a very rational, very professional engineering type.  The hysteria still got to him.  Millions of people have been turned into hypochondriacs over this.</p>

        <p>Yep! I agree a young dude got into an argument on fb with my 70 year old father in law who has copd about masks and how he should definitely wear one and itâ€™s to protect others, blah blah blah. My father in law basically told him to mind his business and donâ€™t worry about what heâ€™s doing or not doing. Makes me happy I walked away from fb over 4 years ago. Reddit is the only social platform I kept and I have been spending way too much time on it since this shit happened. Mostly to make sure Iâ€™m not the only one questioning this shit.</p>

        <p>Or...and go with me on this...</p>
<p>-You are someone who is statistically likely to <em>notice</em> you have CV, let alone <em>die</em> from it.</p>
<p>-You don't know more than 10 people that have had it, and those who did didn't really have a bad case</p>
<p>-You are sensible enough to know that there is a <em>strong</em> possibility that a vaccine is not the answer and</p>
<p>-You've noticed that not only is the government inconsistent on messaging, pretty much anytime someone pops up with a case becomes reason to call out a four-alarm fire and yet the aftermath is pretty much every other day, so much so that you're tired of the idea that people who are well and generally healthy have to live like a crab in a bucket for the sake of every outlier case that will sadly die of it.</p>
<p>Only way out at this point is through, and after the first month, most of us paying attention already knew that.  There's just no getting around it.  The world needs to stop pretending that we can limp along inconsistently and still pretend that it's "doing something" and then keep locking things down at ever opportunity because we're scared.</p>

        <p>No. I want to be able to have freedom of choice again as to the activities I want to do and whether I want to wear a mask. Itâ€™s been almost five months. I think I can assess my own risk at this point. Iâ€™m not responsible for everyone elseâ€™s health. </p>
<p>I also feel like we need to stop hiding under our beds and find a way to get on with life, and quit living in panic over a virus the majority survive. We have to remove the restrictions and loosen the reins at some point. Keeping them until an X number of people have been vaccinated will only further hurt businesses and bankrupt the country as long as everyone is comfortable with money printer handouts.</p>

        <p>It's peer-to-peer mind control.  All of the dystopian stories of the 20th century envisioned an authoritarian state oppressing its people from the top down, no one imagined that we'd all be crabs in one giant bucket.</p>

        <p>I kind of had to come to a place where I had to accept the people posting this sh*t on FB I knew are showing their true selves in this pandemic.  I had to also stop making excuses for their behavior.</p>
<p>I have personally fallen for propaganda many times in my life.  None of us are immune to this because who the h*ll has time to research everything they read for hours a day along with work and etc.  I realized recently the only thing that saved me from behaving like these people is I had a pretty strict ethics code:  no shaming, no name calling, no violating boundaries, no violence verbal or physical</p>
<p>So while I fell for the cotton face mask propaganda early on I didn't do any of the above behaviors with others because I felt it was my personal choice and I own my own choices not other people's choices.  Somehow we've all ended up in an abusive codependent relationship with the entire world around us and no one seems to see this.</p>
<p>These people are behaving a lot of like the abusive people I've known in my life justifying their name calling because they are right even though name calling isn't right in and of itself.</p>

        <p>I want a critical threshold of <em>non</em>-vulnerable to hurry up and be exposed to this virus, <em>not</em> die, and expedite the arrival of herd immunity so that the truly vulnerable and the irrationally fearful will no longer feel the need to self-isolate in their homes and can also get back to the business of living their lives. But even more fundamentally, I want people in a free society to decide for themselves what activities they're comfortable engaging in (or not engaging in).</p>
