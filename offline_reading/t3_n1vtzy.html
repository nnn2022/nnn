        <p>If you look at people who have significant health issues in response to covid, they are fat people and people with vitamin D deficiency. </p>
<p>What do lockdowns discourage? What do they encourage? It's clear and obvious they want you to develop co-morbidities, get covid, and die so they can use your death to manipulate people into further harming their own health. </p>
<p>It is so blatant, so obvious, and so backwards. People truly love their oppression, and this goes so far beyond oppression. We aren't just telling a group "you don't get to vote/you have limited rights/you can't use this water fountain." People are being brainwashed, having their entire thought processes and reward systems restructured, to make it so that they perpetually oppress themselves while believing they are committing a moral right. </p>
<p>We have for real been trained for this since children. In school, in programming on tv, children's books, it all creates a subconscious foundation for life. It's many things that seem harmless. </p>
<p>But then those kids become adults who consume loads of fiction, live in fantasy land of suspended disbelief, spend most time + have most interaction online, they never grow out of it. And then they become physically isolated from other human beings in a lockdown, they totally revert to this conditioning instilled into them as kids and most seem totally incapable of recognizing incontrovertible evidence right in front of their face. </p>
<p>Like I responded to a comment in r/conservative where a dude said you can still get sick after the vaccine. That's a fact, not even contentious. But, people are so conditioned that they must read some malicious intent, or implication that isn't there, into such a statement and then downvote it for saying something they don't like. Then downvoted me for replying without calling him a horrible anti-vaxxer or saying "yea it doesn't stop you from getting sick but definitely still get it."</p>
<p>Not only should it be totally fine to not get the vaccine and discourage others from doing so, but even providing info that could lead to someone questioning medical authority is grounds for your peers attempting to silence you. That's not even what downvotes are for to begin with. The layers of cope are insane.</p>

Everybody on a plane is breathing the exact same air as everyone else for the duration of the flight but somehow the same mask that won't sufficiently protect you in an office will keep you healthy in a flying sardine can.</p>

        <p>It is absolutely no coincidence that the aspects of normal life that are so attacked by Covidians are precisely the ones that make people stronger physically, more reliant on themselves rather than others, and more independent of the need of government. Anything which clearly breaks covid regulations, but does not improve someone personally in any way is always always ALWAYS dismissed and never pointed out. But you wanna go to the gym? Well the grown man with pronouns in his bio is still upset about not having the courage to stand up to his high school bullies a decade ago, and strong men are scary to him, so <em>now</em> you're a grandma killer.</p>

        <p>The reasoning is: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gyms aren't essential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People breathe a lot longer in the gym</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average stay in the gym is about an hour</p>

<li>
<p>Ventilation in gyms are often poor (poorer than, say, a bus).</p>

        <p>Airplanes have surprisingly good ventilation. All the air is filtered out at a pretty rapid rate, and doesnt circulate the entire cabin.</p>
<p>The concern with that is that you're exposed to people outside your bubble for a long time in your close vicinity. If somebody is sitting next to you with covid, your odds aren't good. But the person three aisles down, has much better odds.</p>

<p>Federal prison cells have standard ventilation but houses/apartments are quite variable. This doesn't mean federal prison cells have better ventilation than houses on average.</p>

        <p>Prison cells don't have standard ventilation? That all depends on the architecture of the prison - and there's no regulatory source that I know of for prison architecture.</p>
<p>For planes, on the other hand, you have the FAA. </p>
<p>Regardless, your argument is kind of strange. Planes have like several hundred ventilation ports in a tiny little can, constantly pumping air through HEPA filters. Of course they're going to have better ventilation than your average gym which just uses central air.</p>
<p>You probably shouldn't argue that planes have crappy ventilation. It's not a good way to appear strong in your argument.</p>

<p>"if I genuinely convince you that it's safe to get the vaccine, will you tell me that right now, you will get it?"</p>
<p>If you genuinely convince me of something then yes I will believe that something. That's the most nothing statement you've made in this thread which says a lot. However you'll likely need at least an iota of evidence to be very convincing.</p>

        <p>For starters, I don't think there's any data aggregated around your average gyms ventilation. There's no requirement for a gym to have any ventilation at all. A gym can easily be in a basement and have only ventilation due to the required fire exits.</p>
<p>So I'm really not sure what you're asking of me. Sounds like you want me to jump through hoops in bad faith.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I bet you could take a colored smoke and disperse it in a gym and a plane. The plane would disperse much quicker. That's really all I could tell you. Pretty sure this is too specific for anybody to have actually tested it.</p>

        <p>You're not thinking about the right thing. The measure you want to take is not people per cubic foot, it's air <em>flux</em>, flow per cubic foot.</p>
<p>^Flux being a fluid dynamics term, no I didn't just make it up.</p>
<p>Imagine a perfect cubic foot of air. How much air is moving out of it, in all directions? That's the flux.</p>
<p>You have a mostly still environment? Low flux.</p>
<p>You have an environment with ventilation ports lining the entire thing? High flux.</p>
<p>The flux is going to ultimately determine how much of the air gets recycled. And this is key, for covid, because our air filters are very effective at removing covid containing particulates from the air (even better than masks are).</p>
<p>Because that's what it comes down to: how still is the air? </p>
<p>Stick 4 people in a thousand square foot house with no ventilation, social distancing won't matter. In time, they're all going to be breathing in the same unrecycled air.</p>
<p>Stick 12 people in a thousand square foot house with good ventilation, and, you're much safer. This is a hospital. </p>
<p>Again, the key is ventilation.</p>

        <p>Correct! If you put yourself in a basement with no ventilation, with somebody who has covid, then it is dangerous!</p>
<p>And if you have 100 people in your basement, and only one of them has covid, and there's no ventilation, then it's just as dangerous, to you, as if there were only two of you!</p>
<p>So you see, it's not just the density of people that matters. It's the density of covid in the air.</p>
<p>Now if you crack a window in your basement, it gets a bit safer. </p>
<p>Add some AC, and maybe you have a traditional gym.</p>
<p>Add some air filters and leave the front door open, and you have a traditional gym, during the covid pandemic.</p>
<p>Add a couple industrial grade HEPA filters and several hundred air ventilation ports designed to keep air flowing in a controlled manner, and restrict where you and the infected person are during 98% of the time you're in the basement, and you have a plane!</p>

        <p>This is the most ignorant thing I've ever seen and you should probably be censored the way you like to censor others for "misinformation."</p>
<p>Gyms were NOT "hit hardest by the pandemic."</p>
<p>Who was hit hardest? Really old and/or really sick people. Simple as that.</p>
<p>By closing the gyms you caused people to become less healthy than they would have if allowed to go to the gym. Simple as that.</p>
<p>And if someone is old/sick? They can stay home from the gym -- if they want.</p>
<p>That's the beautiful thing about freedom -- you have a choice over your life, but you and your side don't understand that because you don't understand anything.</p>
<p>You turn the TV on, it tells you what to think, and then you come here and bother us with your nonsense.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I didn't mean to imply hardest of all institutions. It was more a classification, along with bars, indoor restaurants, etc. </p>
<p>Also, your entire argument is easily refuted by remarking that we don't have freedom to drive cars without seatbelts. It's not just about personal freedoms. It's also about the societal costs incurred by not having regulations.</p>

        <p>Oh my dear god. </p>
<p>Don't use one infringement of freedom to justify another. </p>
<p>Even Ralph Nader who fought to make seatbelts standard in cars didn't advocate to steal people's wealth if they forget or choose not to wear them.</p>
<p>Your totalitarianist mentality is vile and disgusting.</p>

        <p>Here's a question out of left field:</p>
<p>Imagine you're driving along and something trips you up and you sideswipe a Ferrari or something. Hey, it happens. </p>
<p>He gets out of the car and let's you know this is a special ferrari and the damages are gonna cost you five million dollars or some shit.</p>
<p>Do you think this is fair? </p>
<p>I ask, because I don't. If you drive a car with fenders that cost $5 million on the street, you probably shouldn't expect random people to pay that much when the inevitable fender bender happens, right? </p>
<p>So if you've engaged with me this long, I think of seatbelts the same way. Because trust me, <em>I'm all about personal liberties.</em> You don't want to wear a seat belt, that is your perogerative. </p>
<p>But now the question becomes a bit more nuanced when you're the driver, who maybe did something stupid, which crashed into somebody, and if they just wore their seatbelt, they wouldn't need life saving limb reattachment or some shit, on your insurance, on your conscience. </p>
<p>And that's where I come to realize that personal freedoms can only be expressed if they also respect a social contract which has the greater good in mind.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope this rambling reaches you.</p>
