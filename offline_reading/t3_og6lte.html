    <strong>Friend of mine just got suspended, site wide, for "Hate speech" because they don't agree that Jim Jordan is a literal pedophile</strong>
    <p><p>This is a FUCKING INSANITY! What did he even say that's HATEFUL? Promoting Hate on reddit is now apparently not agreeing that someone fucks children over a single incident that didn't even physically involve said person. If this isn't "misinformation" I don't know what is.</p>
<p>What the fuck is going on? This site gives way to much power to trolls and shills. See ya in a few days, buddy!</p>
<hr>
<p>Rule Violation: Temporarily Banned for Promoting Hate</p>
<p>You’ve been banned for three days for violating Reddit’s rule against promoting hate in the following content.</p>
<p>Link to reported content: /r/conspiracy/comments/ocuzv7/comment/h3ydphz</p>
<p>Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. We don’t tolerate promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability, and any communities or people that encourage or incite violence or hate towards marginalized or vulnerable groups will be banned.</p>
<p>To avoid future bans, make sure you read and understand Reddit’s Content Policy, including what’s considered promoting hate.</p>
<p>If you use Reddit with a different account and continue to promote hate, or if you’re reported for any further violations of Reddit’s Content Policy after your three-day ban, additional actions including permanent banning may be taken against your account(s).</p>
<p>This is an automated message; responses will not be received by Reddit admins.</p></p>
