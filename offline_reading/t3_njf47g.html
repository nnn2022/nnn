    <strong>It will never be good enough for the doomers.</strong>
    <p><p>For a year the doomers have made excuses to push back the "end date" of the pandemic. It's gone from "Two weeks to stop the spread" to "You can go back to normal once we have *insert random percentage of vaccinations* people vaccinated!"</p>
<p>It is pointless to try and convince these people. They are the literal embodiment of a Dunning Kruger Graph. Since God King Fauci (Masks be upon him) said it, it must be true! Ignore him flip flopping on issues more times than exist numbers in the universe! It's just him updating as new information comes in! It's a cult in the same way Qanon is. It's meant to make it's members ignore all logic, view the other side as brainless cretins, and ignore all they say while fawning over the leaders of it as if they could do no wrong. </p>
<p>The solution isn't trying to get them to realize that we don't need lockdowns, it's to brute force an end to the mask mandates and mandatory vaccinations. The only way to end this is make every state and place like Florida and Texas. No lockdowns, mandates or mandatory vaccinations. Ignore mask mandates, don't shop at places that require masks. Write to your state governor or mayor or congressmen and tell them to lift mandates. The doomers will not listen to you. While it's good intentioned, it's futile to get in an argument with them. It is wasted time.</p></p>

        <p>i really think a lot of them thought we were going to have the perfect movie ending of the pandemic -- the president addressing us as a nation on our independence day, a still masked populace huddled on family couches, hanging on every word saying "the pandemic is officially over!" and then everyone runs out at once into the summer sunshine and rips off their masks for good, laughing and cheering and tearfully hugging.</p>
<p>but this ain't a movie and it never was. it's a wrecked economy full of ruined lives who have had more than enough theatrics.</p>

        <p>Few people outside of reddit, sure, that's why it's important to rally those people to vote in election and pressure governors and senators. They will bow to public pressure if they think not doing so will effect their electoral chances.</p>

        <p>Some are. Some will likely continue to do so until they have no choice to lift them. It's better to make that now rather than later.</p>

        <p>Seems like your complaint about it never being enough for doomers was actually projection. Predictable, but still entertaining.</p>

        <p>I’m want to resist the system in school. I have half days every day, masks for the entire school day, plexi-glass barriers on each desk, social distancing, etc. i’m pissed at the system but I also don’t want to make myself even more miserable. Suggestions?</p>

        <p>Not entirely sure, if it's a mandate by the district country or state I'm not sure what you could do. If it's a school mandate then if you could get enough students to pressure the administrators, maybe.</p>
