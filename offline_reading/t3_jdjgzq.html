        <p>No, mask wearing is stupid. The idea that you can run and hide from a virus behind a piece of cloth is just ridiculous. What does that do to destroy or weaken a virus?....absolutely nothing. Why is everyone running around with their hair on fire because someone tested positive for the China Flu? Every positive case is one step closer to immunity.</p>
<p>I hope we have millions of more cases.....because if you think a vaccine is your savior you`re nuts. Herd immunity and therapeutics are the answer. Not fear mongering.</p>

<p>Except up until now in society, freedom actually did include this. I believe there were lawsuits and maybe even laws against KNOWINGLY having unprotected sex with someone while HIV positive, when it was a death sentence, but short of that there has never been an obligation in society to protect others against viral pathogens one may or may not carry.</p>

        <p>&rt;"Freedom emphatically does not include the freedom to get someone else sick. It does not include the freedom to refuse to wear a mask in the grocery store, sneeze on someone in the produce section and give him the virus. That’s not freedom for the person who is sneezed upon. For that person, the first person’s “freedom” means chains — potential illness and even perhaps a death sentence. No society can function on that definition of freedom."</p>
<ol>
<li>You're free to not go outside of your home. You can order through websites or apps and get it delivered on your door.</li>
<li>You're free to stay 6 feet away from everyone else, wash your hands, wear a mask yourself etc. You're not free to tell others what they should do. You're responsible for your own health. You're responsible for what you eats, what you wears, if you smoke/drink or not and how far away you stand.</li>
<li>You're free to wear mask, but you're not free to tell other people to wear one. Maybe they didn't wear one because of they had mental health condition (autism, PTSD, anxiety, claustrophobia), physical disability (E.g. CP) or is a linguistical minority depending on lip reading (E.g. Deaf/deaf/Hoh). Mask wearers are free to not take off their mask, write down what they're saying and stay away from people - and everyone else are free to not wear a mask, disagree with your behavior and boycott a business who voluntarily have restrictions or show disagreement to the state. If a business voluntarily required to wear masks and employees didn't write down what they said to me, I would instantly boycott.<br>
My teachers in college wears black masks and refuse to use a clear one 50% of the time because they feel they're silly. By law they're free to wear what they wants to. It still doesn't change that I'm falling behind and ask friends to help me with my studies instead. When my teachers can't teach me when I've paid for going to college, I get help somewhere else. I'm free to not let masks affect my ability to communicate, learn and participate in class negatively by not wearing them in class.</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt; “Fairness” is a liberal word. You rarely hear conservatives talking about fairness. </p>
<p>Not all mask and lockdown skeptical are right wing. That's just an assumption. Some are left wings. It's not fair to make masks mandatory or judge people for not wearing them either. Not all does it to be cool. Some doesn't wear them because of disabilities, mental health conditions or because of they belongs to a linguistical minority. None should need to feel humiliated and ashamed for not wearing them, or go through the difficult process of applying for an exempt. People should be allowed to choose to wear them if they wants to and leave everyone else alone. Liberals who cares so much about disabled, poor and minorities - praising diversity - should accept people are different. I'm a left wing myself.</p>
