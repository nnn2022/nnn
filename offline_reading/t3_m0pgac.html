<h1>School Closure - 3/8/21</h1>
<p>This is a message from Jim Knoll, the Superintendent of  Edwardsburg Public Schools.  All schools will be closed Monday, March 8,  due to the number of staff absences.  On Saturday, March 6, many of our  staff members received their second vaccination for COVID-19.   Unfortunately, a number of these employees are displaying side effects  from these vaccinations.  Because of the lingering symptoms, remote  instruction is not possible.  At this time, EPS plans to return to  normal schedule Tuesday, March 9.  All after school activities will take  place as scheduled as this is not a weather related closure.  Please  stay healthy.                      "</p></p>

        <p>3 total schools closed because of this: </p>
<p>“Schools in three states, Michigan, Ohio and New York were forced to close for a day last month after school staff could not work due to severe side effects from COVID-19 vaccinations.</p>
<p>Schools in Alma and Ithaca, Michigan were closed on Feb. 16, 2021 because the majority of the teachers had experienced side effects after they received the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. School superintendent Donalynn Ingersoll closed school in Alma in anticipation of the vaccine’s severe side effects, saying:</p>
<p>“As 70 percent of our staff (across all employee groups) will be receiving their second dose over the weekend, this means there is potential for us to be unable to provide coverage for the number of staff who may not report for work on Monday.”</p>
<p>Shepard schools in Michigan also closed its doors after a large number of the staff suffering from immediate negative reactions to the second dose of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine called in sick.3 Superintendent, Greg Miller, sent an e-mail stating,</p>
<p>“Unfortunately we will need to call a snow day for tomorrow, Thursday, due to the district’s staff experiencing ill symptoms from their second dose of the Covid vaccine. Their will be no on-line instruction.”</p>
<p>In Ohio, schools in the Fairless district were forced to close school after many of the staff suffered negative reactions to the first round of the COVID-19 vaccination. Maureen Ahmann, MD, medical director for Stark County Health Department said she was not concerned about the large number of people experiencing negative vaccine reactions said:</p>
<p>“As far as specifically the call-off numbers in Fairless, I haven’t spoken to them, but I am not surprised if people are having some of the reactions like that to the vaccine. In fact, it’s kind of good news because we know they are responding.”</p>
<p>Ohio’s Summit County Health Commissioner Donna Skoda stated:</p>
<p>“Feeling uncomfortable and having a headache is nowhere near what COVID can do to you and if you are fortunate enough in this vaccine shortage, to be able to have a vaccine offered to you, you should take it and put up with whatever side effects you have. … As far as people using that as an excuse not to get the vaccine, that’s their choice. No one is forcing anyone to get the vaccine. That’s not happening so if their choice is they are not going to take it, that’s their health, that’s their choice, but we are going to give it to as many people as want it.”</p>
<p>Staff members in the Sandy Creek district schools in New York suffered a similar fate when one-third of the school staff reported feeling ill after receiving the 2nd shot of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine causing the school to close for a day.8 Superintendent, Kyle Faulkner explained:</p>
<p>“We are a small district, and we had so many folks down and out today that we didn’t have enough people to staff the schools,’’ Faulkner said. “Some people get pretty sick with the second shot.’” </p>
