        <p>As someone who has worked the entire time of the pandemic , I noticed an extreme difference in attitudes between my coworkers and my mom's, who works at a school where the teachers were at home the majority of the school year. She had one teacher have a complete mental breakdown after yelling at someone for not wearing a mask and coming too close to him and another one, highly upset, keep telling other teachers they were all going to die.</p>
<p>At my work (small call center) we've always been in close proximity and never wore masks. We've had maybe 5 confirmed cases at all our locations (7 total - about 100 employees), but we never shut down, just treated this as the normal flu and just continued about our lives. I agree that what the media is doing is taking a toll on people mentally. When you're isolated and hearing a death toll rise, why wouldn't you believe otherwise unless you're out there living your life?</p>

        <p>Why did the news companies promote lockdown so heavily? Profit. The evidence is RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOUR FACES! Follow the profit charts. </p>
<p>They don't even hide it from us. The richest of the rich got <em>even richer</em> during 2020. Facebook, Google, news companies, etc. profited <em>massively</em> during 2020. </p>
<p>Why does Walmart support lockdown? They can destroy their competition! </p>
<p>Stay home and consume Netflix, Facebook, Google, News, etc. it's literally giving them so much profit. Their numbers are public. It's so plain obvious and yet you get called a conspiracy theorist for pointing out this. </p>
<p>No, the media do NOT have your best interest at heart. It's a conflict of interest. They could promote real news (covid has 99.9% survival rate) OR they could keep talking about variants and india and omg the world is gonna end from covid and keep making $. </p>
<p>They're literally laughing their way to the bank.</p>

        <p>Don't forget Amazon! Bezos might have gotten richer than them all! </p>
<p>Another interesting thing about Amazon... It was such perfect timing and coincidence that they launched their own line of delivery trucks just in time for the Pandemic that caused billions of people to lock-down, and Amazon orders to skyrocket. Hmmm... It's almost as if Bezos somehow knew in advance...</p>

<p>SMDH at people who get vaccinated when they already have natural immunity. The natual immunity is almost certainly better than the vaccine, and the vaccine destroys what natural immunity you have (which is why vaccinated people can't give convalescent plasma, even if they had been before).</p>

        <p>&rt;Can I donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma if I have received the vaccination?</p>
<p>&rt;At this time individuals who have received a COVID-19 vaccine are not able to donate convalescent plasma with the Red Cross. The Red Cross is working as quickly as possible to evaluate this change – as it may involve complex system updates. Please know, the Red Cross is committed to building a readily available inventory of convalescent plasma to ensure patients battling COVID-19 have all treatment options available to them.</p>
<p>https://www.redcrossblood.org/local-homepage/news/article/covid-19-vaccination-guide-blood-donation.html</p>
<p><em>Convalescent Plasma</em> cannot be donated from someone who had the vaccine. The vaccine spike proteins overpower natural antibodies, even though they're probably less robust overall in terms of duration and efficacy. There is absolutely no reason for anyone who had an active infection to get a vaccine.</p>

        <p>As usual for anti-vaxxers you take a kernel of truth and twist it to suit your agenda. </p>
<p>Vaccinated can donate blood. They have a policy of not donating plasma for acute treatment of Covid hospitalized patients because they operate under an abundance of caution to give the best antibodies to those who are already severely infected. </p>
<p>They think it <em>might</em> be better to give plasma from previously infected people because it <em>may possibly</em> be more effective than plasma from vaccinated people to fight an ongoing hospitalized case. </p>
<p>That has absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with blood or plasma being <em>hazardous</em> to recipients. That is where your lie starts.</p>

        <p>I never said it was hazardous you dolt. Just that it was ineffective because natural antibodies are no longer present and spike proteins aren't effective for use in <em>convalescent plasma.</em></p>
<p>Do you understand I'm not talking about blood donations or plasma donations for other purposes? I've never been vague about what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>From the top of this chain I said "there's no reason for someone who was infected to get the vaccine" -- by your own logic the vaccine isn't perfect and doesn't prevent reinfection. You know what does (or should) prevent reinfection? Natural antibodies.</p>
<p>The same natural antibodies no longer present in the plasma of infected-and-vaccinated people.</p>

        <p>Correct, there is no vaccine that does that.</p>
<p>mRNA that instructs your cells to create a spike protein antibody that overpowers natural antibodies?</p>
<p>"Once people are vaccinated, they cannot donate plasma. Vitalant said the reason why is because the vaccine causes spike antibodies, and for convalescent plasma, they need nucleocapsid antibodies."</p>

        <p>I'm more than willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Convalescent plasma - plasma donated by someone who had an infection and has natural antibodies - is an effective and approved therapy for COVID patients.</p>
<p>People who were eligible to give convalescent plasma are no longer eligible to give convalescent plasma because the important natural antibodies are no longer present in enough quantities to provide benefit.</p>
<p>What other explanation do you have?</p>
<p>Abundance of caution? Not enough data?</p>
<p>Cool, now do the vaccines themselves.</p>

        <p>Man you anti-vaxxers are dense. Like I said, taking <em>publicly</em> available info, not some secret knowledge being hidden, and twisting it to suit your agenda. </p>
<p>They follow up with a detailed explanation, but you are probably too dense to understand it, want a link?</p>
<p>https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-redcross-vaccinated-idUSL1N2MR1HU</p>
<p>Of course someone who was infected will have a higher amount of circulating antibodies to fight an already established infection in another person through plasma donation. </p>
<p>A vaccine will help create antibodies for those who have not been infected yet to stop it before it starts. Genius. </p>
<p>They also clarified that someone who has been infected and got vaccinated after CAN donate. It is stated very clearly, fool.</p>

        <p>Same.  I have 40 employees and we are in the construction industry.  We had a bunch of “cases” and close contacts so people did miss some time, but we never closed.  Some got sick, some didn’t, but nobody died and nobody has “long Covid.”  We have people from their 20’s to 60’s and it was pretty much the same for everyone.  I’ve been skeptical since day 1, and 100% with the notion that the media and government completely over blew this thing to a ridiculous proportion and continues to do so.</p>

        <p>Being in IT is good these days.
We techs have been working at a place with a skeleton crew since April last year. As "essentials", we have had time to tidy up our hardware, that's for sure.
Every now and then, some guy shows up in his/her magical device. You know. That mask that keep everybody alive somehow.
Us in the house can't prevent us from smiling at them.</p>

        <p>We can't even treat it like a developed nation would treat the flu. Our crony corporatism (capitalism) is so heavily favored in the US that we don't even have guaranteed paid sick leave, like most developed nations. The balance of power is far too heavily biased to capital at the cost of labor.</p>

        <p>This is me as well. Never believed in any of it being as bad as they said since the onset, and have seen everything I predicted would be, eventually turn out to be true. The only thing I got wrong was how many people, including people close to me, would fall for it all, be completely duped, and allow themselves to become straight up bad human beings out of fear.

        <p>Yes! Many of my coworkers and employees followed the rules because we are under obligation of our employer to follow the rules. About a week in, we realized we were our own pandemic pod, and life continued as normal. Some of us got covid, some had to quarantine but were fine, and some were never affected.</p>

        <p>I worked in an auto parts store where 1/2 of our customers used a mask if not less before this job change to the trades recently and I never wore a mask while I was there and still didn't get it after the whole time covid was around or I just didn't notice it. The amount of people that would take there's off after they ask of they need and I just responded with "your a grown man and I'm 19 what am I going to do to you, you can make your own choices" was amazing saying it like that made people realize how fucking stupid it was</p>

        <p>For sure I went to a family owned gas station everyday while I worked around them because they didn't require masks. I told everyone who wasn't wearing one they didn't need one there and I saw a lot more people going there as time went on, all without masks on employees or customers. Unfortunately many very vocal anti mask bussinesses in my city have been shunned by the sheep especially the local subreddit browsers. Which I'm sure the owners don't care but it sucks to get review bombed by a bunch of people who've never been there and never will.</p>

I've been finding myself going over his manifesto in my mind the last few months and it's fascinating how he had so many points, yet he wrote that in 1995 before computers were even considered advanced by most standards. The dude saw how over socialization can cause problems in some people's brains and he called that out in '95, way before social media platforms.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say it's bullplop, just because what you're saying is true. Because what the OP said is extremely true as well. The public school system is 100% an indoctrination system, whose entire existence at this point is to mold and shape young people into the awful kind of humans that we're seeing in their teens and 20s running around screaming at people on reddit, Twitter, and elsewhere now. The private schools can indeed be just as complicit in pushing false narratives, or not doing enough to stave off false narratives from seeping into their curriculums. So you are right, as well as OP.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think it comes down to the individual, and how they are wired. The people who are strong in spirit, constitution, and intelligence can make it through unscathed by the lies, and misinformation fed to them by the system. A lot falls onto the parents, and how involved they are in their kids' lives, and making sure they're instilled with a strong framework of belief, so they can sniff out and detect the lies and BS, regardless of the education delivery system.</p>

<p>This is the spirit! Life can kick us and get us down sometimes. But look for the lesson (and there almost always is one), and get back up, learn from it, and be even better than before!

        <p>The thing about any media is… you control your own intake of said media. You even chose your own flavor of media. Everyone just needs to turn it off and not consume or mainline it like it were Chrystal meth. But to lump all media together is intellectually dishonest. The MSM does not all take a vote of what to cover. Your ratings do!! So I don’t think it’s a fair accusation. It’s like blaming the sugar cereal company for your kid being fat. We all know about the sugar in it. But they eat it anyway and thus becomes fat. Is that a personal choice?  or the breakfast company‘s fault for putting delicious junk food on the market. Personal responsibility used to be an important part of capitalism.</p>

        <p>Here in USA through most of the country and Pennsylvania where I live, things are practically back to "normal" however I am not celebrating and remain very cynical at the same time for all of this COVID terrorism is far from over when taking into account the world as a whole. Many countries still have COVID restrictions within their borders, many countries still require those stupid COVID tests and quarantines to travel to those countries and many countries still want fully vaccinated people to get tested for COVID even though some countries are allowing one to skip testing and Quarantines if fully vaccinated. Media outlets are harping on and on about the now called Delta Variant as many countries extend restrictions over this so called variant- Even in some countries that have a high vaccination rate already when they could at least allow those already vaccinated nationally and internationally to skip those tests and quarantines. Here in USA, it will be interesting to see whether or not things shut down again come fall and winter over so called Delta Variant. Absolutely! What has been done over these last 16 months worldwide is evil indeed! You can say that again about psychological terrorism and I myself do not feel the same mentally as I did before all this COVID torture started. This whole thing has totally messed people up mentally indeed and I can relate for this whole thing has made me and many others insecure about plans, planning, what the future may hold, and so on.</p>

        <p>The irony is of course that the hunger for alternative news sources outside mainstream media has led to Russian sponsored alt news networks that seek to divide and create polarised opinion.</p>
<p>The Qanon thing is a prime example. Putin was trained extensively in his KGB years to promote falsehoods and conspiracies that tore families apart. He has psychologically wrecked the USA without firing a single bullet.</p>

<p>I blame mainstream media for me even looking for alternative news. I couldn't care any less about Russian or Chinese propaganda. I just don't want to read ANY propaganda.</p>

        <p>Quite the opposite actually. I know more about how news media works than most people do. Of course US media is a very complicated and corrupt industry, given the toxic influence of the Murdoch and Mercer families, among others, and the fact that anyone can set up an internet channel and call themselves a "news network". Breitbart is a prime example of this.</p>

        <p>When US mainstream media have 6 and only 6 different owners, it's understandable that they all cooperative.
They do what money, politicians, and a three letter agency tell them.
I'm not sure in what order tho. But I hope profit come first.</p>
<p>Real Journalism have been dead for decades. I hope you know that.
If no, then you're really gullible and naive.</p>

        <p>Not denying that the media has definitely had a hold on people and instilling fear...but...100 years ago during the midst of the 1918 pandemic the world didn't have the media to inform people, and even when most of the world knew of the pandemic, most countries refused to report it. The death toll was between 17 and 100 million - no one really knows I guess. With the widespread media during this pandemic the death toll has been 3.7 million (roughly). </p>
<p>The fear was there during the 1918 pandemic as well but imagine if the media had reported it as soon as it broke and how many lives could have been saved. </p>
<p>Many people say they have it bad now. They have it bad because they can't be 'free'. Honestly, compared to over 100 years ago they have it good. The medical advancements and the widespread media have saved millions of lives.  The economy will always bounce back. </p>
<p>The mental toll of being locked inside for over a year is hard, I agree. It sucks. I hate the rules as much as the next guy but I stuck to them and my entire bubble stayed safe.</p>
