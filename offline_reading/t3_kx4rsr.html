        <p>If it truly was as dangerous and as bad as they say, I really don't think there would be so many people questioning it. 
I don't think they would need to try so hard to keep people indoors. There would be no need for rules and restrictions because people would be choosing to stay hidden the best they could. </p>
<p>If what they have told us about this virus was true, then it would be a case of reversal. They would be having to convince people it was safe to go outside. They wouldn't be forcing people out of work, they'd be desperate for workers. </p>
<p>For the few who did think is was a load of shit, if what they want us to believe about it is true then so many more people who don't believe its that bad should be dropping like flies. I dont mean dead either, just ill. Theyd sharp learn their lesson and remain indoors.</p>
<p>Piers corbyn is a fine example. He is in his seventies I believe, completely anti lockdown and doesn't even believe the virus exists. He has held and participated in every rally against these measures, surrounded by thousands of maskless people at protests, hugged, shook hands and socialised with many. He hasn't even so much as had a sniffle. 
Luck is the excuse people give for him not getting ill, but come on. If it was that deadly and contagious he must have a guardian angel by his side! A year of protesting. Along with the many who have been by his side who also are not dropping like flies.  </p>
<p>I believe there probably is a virus. I just believe it has been overhyped and overblown for the great reset. How else would they get people to close their businesses in order to crash the economy which is needed for the great reset.</p>

<p>they promised us bodies piling up in the streets and idk but i live in a "hot spot" and i haven't even seen a single body and i'm very disappointed, tbh. i don't hear ambulance sirens. the hospitals are doing fine, even though it's flu season. things have been pretty quiet since march, actually.</p>
<p>if there's going to be a "pandemic" that changes our entire way of life, i better see a fucking dead body or two.</p>

        <p>I believe that the lockdowns have a positive effect, and I believe that the vaccines work. I don't know if everyone on this sub thinks that the vaccine doesn't work, but I think it will safe a lot of lifes. Vaccines which are made, for example, for cervical cancer, also save countless of lives. Most fatalities of that disease are in thirld world countries, where the supplies of vaccines are severely lacking.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do have to agree with someone else on this post, who says that (some) officials are very hypocritical. They institute a lockdown, and then they break the rules of the lockdown. In Belgium, where I live, there was recently a plan in a couple of municipalities to use drones to check on people during New Years Eve. Of course this is completely unacceptable, and there was heavy objection. Still not quite sure if it was actually passed though...</p>
<p>Now you might be saying that a lockdown is also severely restricting civil liberties, but I think that the current situation of the world may allow such a thing. Ever since the second lockdown was instituted in Belgium, the amount of deaths and infections has decreased significantly.</p>
<p>I would like to hear what you think, though. I'm openminded.</p>

        <p>well, thank you for being open minded. feel free to stick around here, loads of smart people with lots of good inputs. i think you'll find that while we're opposed to lockdown in the short term, we're fine with individuals making these choices for themselves, and leaving other people alone. the real thing we're worried about is the "new normal" and long term changes to our society, economy, and government. that's far scarier than any respiratory virus.</p>
<p>question about Gardasil, the HPV vaccine that can prevent cervical cancer: is that a mandatory vaccine in Belgium? here in the U.S., it is not. so while i'm vaccinated (and i was vaccinated at age 22, which is considered late, but i was eager to get it as soon as it was available), my husband (same age) is not. do you think Gardasil should be a mandatory vaccine for men and women,  since cervical cancer is both terrible and now preventable?</p>

        <p>In Belgium it is mandatory. In middle school girls get the vaccine at school (I don't know how that works in the US), but that's how it works in Belgium. I think it gets injected twice, in the first and second year of middle school, although I could be wrong. In any case, the vaccine is mandatory.</p>
<p>And also, isn't cervical cancer only possible for women? Only women have a cervix, don't they?</p>

        <p>in the U.S. it's not mandatory, but we strongly encourage all young men and woman to get the vaccine as young teenagers before they become sexually active. four strains of HPV cause cervical cancer, and the vaccine targets those strains.</p>
<p>while yes, only women with cervixes can have cervical cancer, both men and women can get HPV and transmit it to their partners, which is why men should get the vaccine, should they be sexually active with a woman.</p>
<p>Gardasil also vaccinates against the strain of HPV that causes mouth and throat cancer, which affects men and women, but we've seen a rise in these cancers in men.</p>
<p>i wish we did a better job publishing scientific data about Gardasil and HPV, and that we didn't sex shame people who vaccinate their teenagers. this vaccine isn't going to encourage teenagers to have sex, it just protects them when they do decide to be sexually active. they're still going to need condoms. sex ed in the U.S. is abysmal and there's a lot of misinformation.</p>

        <p>yeah, mouth and throat cancers are scary as fuck, and no one ever talks about them. oral sex is all fun and good but it can have serious health repercussions. i'm all about <em>safe</em> sex - let's have more informed, safer sex, and make better life choices!</p>
<p>my sex ed in the late 1990s was basically, "if you have sex you will get pregnant or you will get AIDS or you will get both and die. here, have some condoms."</p>
<p>everyone benefits from good sex ed and a healthy discourse around sexual activity. i'm sorry to hear that it's just as crappy in Belgium.</p>

        <p>Oh well, Belgium definitely has a lot of flaws. Forming a government once took over 500 days, so it's safe to say that I live in a divided country. The three communities are constantly alienating from eachother and honestly, it's a surprise we still exist. Although, the Flemish ministry of education did recently pass a reform that completely changed the system, so perhaps there is more time invested in sex ed. But to be honest, seeing how so many people vote right in Belgium, I don't think that much changed on the regard of sex education. It's a pretty forgotten subject.</p>

        <p>yikes! it's easy to forget (as an American) that even in a very small country like Belgium, there are big social/cultural differences. no one (country) is perfect. but i think perfect is the enemy of good enough, and we could all do better - at least we could listen to one another. Americans think Europe is some perfect society, and Europe thinks America is a hot mess - the truth lies somewhere in between.</p>
<p>something like sex ed shouldn't be political. in fact, i wish sex ed was much less social/cultural, and more brutally honest. look, herpes suck. genital warts? awful. HIV/AIDS? used to be a death sentence. no one ever wants to get an abortion. emotions are not always black and white - they're very much in the grey - but we need to be more nuanced about feelings and firm on the facts and data. everyone has feelings, and everyone can get herpes.</p>
<p>but we also need to let people evaluate and take their own risk, you know? give them knowledge and data, but respect personal liberty. it always surprises me (at least) that most people aren't terrible assholes, and they're just doing their best - they don't want to hurt anyone or screw it all up, they're just trying to get by. even right now, i still think 67% of people are genuinely probably okay humans and not fascist despots. (but i'm very much a Locke and not a Hobbes, so your mileage may vary.)</p>
<p>and for what it's worth, people on the right over here are probably very much like the people on the right in continental Europe - it's a gut reaction to something they have no control over. i think we could all do a better job recognizing our similarities and joint conditions instead of focusing on our differences.</p>
<p>this was ultimately a lovely dialogue, sir games-a-lot - thanks for the nice convo! may god bless and keep you, and please stick around - NoNewNormal will surprise you!</p>

        <p>i have a better chance of dying from cervical cancer so i got that sweet sweet Gardasil as soon as it was available in 2007. and those shots are like the MMR vaccines - big and painful, but totally worth it. and i was sexually active before i got the shot, so i was already less of a priority. i don't regret it.</p>
<p>the Rona? nah i'll worry about her in my 50s when i have to get a shingles vaccine.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t trust the government if they told me the sky was blue. The amount of times governments have hidden or pushed an agenda is crazy and it’s astonishing people still believe them. I know you asked for sources but that was the video I had remembered. You will find many other sources, unless they got removed from the internet. Although I wouldn’t believe everything from an independent source either. It’s hard to know who’s telling the truth these days.</p>

        <p>unanswered questions always piss me off. </p>
<p>If this is truly a health crisis, why is no one talking about diet and getting exercise as a means of defeating the virus when used in tandem with mask wearing and gloves? </p>
<p>You ever read Plato's Allegory of the Cave? The search for understanding usually starts with something really small and tiny that does not make sense. Usually it's something that can be explained away just out of one being ignorant, but sometimes it isn't, and scripture especially is rampant with them. Things like if women were created from men then why do men have nipples, or why doesn't the Christian God forgive Satan if the defining act of Christ is to forgive? You know, things that leave someone wandering around in their head with an answer of 5 but only 2 and 2 to add with.</p>
