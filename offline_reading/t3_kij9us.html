    <strong>If this really is a forever thing, then I won’t be around for it.</strong>
    <p><p>Ugh, I didn’t want to post this here but I don’t know where else to turn. I’m 17 and I tried to cope with 2020 and all of the pain and anguish for a long time, but when my school decided to give up and switch to remote “learning” about a week after the election was called things took a turn for the worst with my mental health. They had this plan all along to go remote for the holiday season, despite the fact that the state SPECIFICALLY FUCKING TOLD THEM NOT TO DO THAT. They said that we’d be back on January 4th but I didn’t trust them at all for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>We didn’t actually start remote “learning” until November 23rd, and while those first two days before Thanksgiving weren’t terrible every single one of the seventeen days that we’ve had it since except for when I was actually doing something outside that day, were terrible.</p>
<p>First of all, I don’t burn off any energy that I have during the day, so I can’t sleep. I’m so groggy and tired when I wake up that I just don’t feel like eating and that lasts the whole day, and it’s just unbelievably depressing for obvious reasons. And it’s not like in the spring where i actually wanted to go outside, the world was still somehow way more peaceful than right now, it was month two instead of month ten, and I wasn’t blackpilled like I am now.</p>
<p>So by the end of the first full week I was in the worst mental state that I had been in in two years, a place that I NEVER EVER thought I’d be back in, but there I was. The second week was less terrible but it was still bad and I couldn’t eat or sleep. But then my dad and I broke the quarantine rules and crossed state lines into Vermont to go skiing that Saturday, and we were there until this past Sunday, and we got to ski a total of seven days, every day except the day we got there and last Monday when I had a doctor’s appointment. I still had to do “school” and I still had some issues eating but by the end of the week I felt immensely better, and for the first time since Thanksgiving I actually felt somewhat happy and for the first time since before my school abandoned us things felt hopeful. And on Thursday we got 25 inches of snow, and when we went skiing everyone’s cars kept getting stuck, so we all helped each other out, and nobody cared about COVID. It was really nice to actually be able to have fun with other people, I can count on one hand how many times that’s happened since March. Crazy how I only felt happy once I broke the rules, it’s like you’re supposed to be sad all the time.</p>
<p>Then yesterday I had ski practice back at home, so I was busy yesterday as well but the eating was still an issue.</p>
<p>But today I was in “class” and I heard that we’re not going back on January 4th, we’re going back on January 19th and in a single instant all of the progress of the past ten days was gone, now I’m back to the same place as before because I know it’s not gonna be January 19th, they’re probably gonna keep pushing it out two weeks until they run out of weeks and then when we get to August they’ll start cutting into next year. This is my senior year and I might end it having literally only 20 days in school, and with all of them being dystopian compared to usual. It’s so terrible.</p>
<p>This whole year has opened my eyes to just how horrible the world is. I don’t care who you are or what ideologies you believe in, everyone can agree that the world is on the wrong track and society is broken. Our politicians fought and bickered for months while the American people suffered and they only came up with $600 to help. They got paid $130000 to give us basically nothing back. People have put off, cancelled, postponed, and paused everything and have gotten nothing in return. My generation was already a depressed and suicidal mess before the pandemic and now we’re not only gonna have way more of that but in the end we will be the ones cleaning up the mess that the older generations made on society. The 15-24 age group has put the most fun part of their lives on hold for over nine months now and have gotten literally nothing in return but shitty watered down school and debt. If you try to speak out, you are shunned. Nobody cares about us, not society, not the government, and certainly not our teachers. The young seem to be viewed as unimportant and expendable, and everyone loves to virtue signal about mental health but when push comes to shove they don’t care. For example, my 15 year old sister had a mental breakdown over her online quiz freezing in the middle of “class” on Friday, she was bawling her eyes out on Zoom, and she emailed the teacher about her concerns and all she got back was a snarky and disrespectful reply. My sister has been so stressed out and sad that my mom literally made her a fucking cake this weekend to cheer her up. She and many of my peers have the same eating, sleeping, and mental issues as I do but guess what? Nobody cares. But we as young people haven’t even had it the worst when it comes to being ignored, small business owners have been completely hung out to dry and most of them are gonna end up losing everything from this, but guess what? Nobody cares.</p>
<p>I just can’t keep living like this, like I know I have ski season and my dad has said that I need to be in Vermont as much as possible for my mental health and once the snow melts I can get a summer job to fill the void of school if they don’t let us back in this year.</p>
<p>But that won’t be enough. I used to have hopes and dreams, wishes to see the world and meet new people and just have fun from back in February that are beginning to die away. Skiing and a summer job won’t replace everything I wanted to do in 2020 AND 2021. I still have hopes to let loose once this is all over, but what if it doesn’t end? What if this is life forever?</p>
<p>I’m not sold on all of the theories that you guys have about Bill Gates and the vaccine and shit. I don’t believe them honestly but I leave anything on the table now, and if you guys end up being right about this being forever than I’ll without a doubt end up taking my life in 2022. I even chose a date for it already, March 5, 2022. That date has significance for me negatively and that’s the main reason why I chose it but it also happened to be fifteen months after I decided that committing suicide might be my only way out.</p>
<p>It’s sobering and incredibly sad talking about my demise, especially considering that on that date I’ll only be 18 years old, but if things don’t get any better and we’re still doing the same thing as right now, and there’s no way to escape to a place that isn’t locked down, than it’s my only way out. I consider the chances to be rather unlikely that 2022 or even 2021 are anywhere near as terrible as 2020 but they’re there. My rationale behind the decision is that I don’t want to live a life of pain or loneliness, I want to be free to see the world, and if I can’t do that in the “land of the free, home of the brave”, than maybe I’ll be able to do it in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p></p>

<p>I don't know how literally you meant this, but I'm going to recommend <em>The Irresistible Revolution</em> and <em>The Coming Insurrection</em> as two books to give you a shot of hope. The Kingdom of Heaven can be built on Earth. We don't need permission from mortal princes, in whom there is no salvation. God warned us about kings.</p>

        <p>I meant it as I’ll be able to experience freedom in the afterlife.</p>
<p>The Bible says that people who commit suicide go to hell but I don’t believe that, because I know what it’s like to be in that place and they do it because people feel like they have no choice.</p>
<p>But I might wanna check those books out, after all I’ll probably have tons of time on my hands for months on end again, so why not?</p>

        <p>The Bible doesn’t say that, actually. It says no murder, meaning no self-murdering either. But certainly there is no “suicide = automatic hell” clause in there. However, don’t do that. Things won’t be bad forever, your best years are yet to come.</p>

        <p>Please do not take your own life, friend. The only thing that is certain in our short lives is that they will eventually come to an end. Why bring that certainty before you know what might happen? Please know that the truth will ALWAYS prevail, whether it takes 5 years or 50. I know it seems hard, and this is such a hard way to begin your life, but I promise you that if you keep the truth in your heart, you cannot be shaken.</p>

        <p>Hang in there. Things will get better. Don't let the more extreme weirdos in this sub convince you that this will go on forever. Definitely don't kill yourself. Seek mental health support if you are genuinely suicidal. Do it for your family if not for yourself.</p>

        <p>I’m not suicidal now, and I’ve held on to hope that things will get better come April, May, and June. After all I have this weird pattern where every year switches from bad to good and vice versa, and 2021 is supposed to be the good year and that’s the main reason why I’m waiting until at least January 2022. But if nothing gets better next year then it’ll probably get worse in 2022 and I just don’t know if I’ll be able to deal with it.</p>
<p>I’m like 95% certain that I’ll wake up on March 6, 2022 alive and well, but I can’t rule out anything, and suicide could be the only real way to escape tyranny if this sub is right. I’d do it to be free, but I don’t want it to get to that point.</p>

        <p>Listen, I was depressed before all this madness started, and now I'm even more in the depths of depression than I've ever been in my life and I know how hopeless and meaningless life feels because I feel this hell inside of me every damn day. I know that there is nothing to take away that feeling except for if this would all just go away and justice would be served to the tyrants. Believe me, I feel it constantly, but if there is just one little thing I can do to distract me from it, even for just a little while, it helps, albeit only a tiny bit and only for a short time.</p>
<p>I know how much you don't want to be in a world like this, because I don't either, but reading that just now made me want to cry because there are so few young people like you that realize this idiocy and the world needs you. If you really wanted to, you could move to Sweden or someplace that isn't as bad, and I'd be happy to teach you Swedish.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I often do feel like I was born in the wrong generation but a lot of my friends either agree with me about this or we don’t talk about current events. But yeah the fact that my mom has to tell me to not post any pictures from outside of my home state to social media because of the wokies is really a sign of the times.</p>
<p>I live in Massachusetts and 2020 has made me realize that once I’m able to, I’m getting the fuck out of here and moving to New Hampshire. My grandparents live on the Maine sea coast right near the New Hampshire border so if they needed anything I’d be right there which would be perfect. I’m applying to UNH soon and the fact that it’s in New Hampshire and they actually have in person classes even now might be the deciding factor for me should I get into multiple schools.</p>
<p>I have thought about moving to South Dakota or Iowa or something where they don’t give a shit once I’m out of college, but that’s very far away from home and I’m a homebody at heart. Sweden could also be an option and plus it would be a great way to see the world.</p>

        <p>I also feel like I was born in the wrong generation. I'm 18, but I would love to live in the 50s or even 60s. I always felt a sense of connection to that time even though I've never lived it. If there was nothing to keep me in Ohio, I'd move to South Dakota probably, or maybe even just get up and move to Sweden. I've wanted to long before this. For some reason I just fell in love with it in high school, so I taught myself Swedish and I am seriously considering moving there. Sweden is a super liberal country, but at least they're doing something right. And almost all Swedes speak great English and Swedish is an easy language to learn.</p>

        <p>I would have loved to have been born 20 years earlier. I’ve always been fascinated with the year 2000 and had I been born 20 years earlier I would have been a junior when it happened.</p>
<p>9/11 would have been three or four weeks into college, but that’s nothing compared to this. At least we could actually unite then. I think it would have been easier for me if I had been 36 instead of 16 at the onset of the pandemic too, except for the fact that I’d probably have 0-10 year old kids by then and I can’t imagine it’s easy on parents of little kids right now. My baby cousins are 7 and 4 and the older one has had almost as much clown world K-12 school as normal K-12 school and it breaks my heart. The younger one will never know snow days and shit like that even if we go back to normal. It makes me so sad.</p>

        <p>I’m trying to do that, both my dad and my therapist agreed when I had my doctor’s appointment that I needed to be in Vermont as much as possible. We plan to go up again after Christmas and we could be up there for New Year’s.</p>
<p>Our plan is to be in Vermont four or five days a week pretty much every week as long as school is remote or hybrid and I don’t think we have any chance of being fully in school until probably April so this is gonna last pretty much the whole ski season. I have ski team in January and early February too so I could end up going skiing six days a week for a lot of that time. We also plan on going to Utah with my dad’s friends in February too and I hope that that plan stays.</p>
<p>Then once we get into May and June hopefully shit really starts to open up and life goes back to normal but even if it doesn’t I won’t be following the restrictions then.</p>
<p>I don’t see myself six feet under in fifteen months, I’ll only do it if we’re basically living like we’re in China with no clear end date, and I don’t think that that’ll be the case but anything is possible.</p>

        <p>I’m your age-ish, a bit younger (16) and tbh I feel the same way. Like eerily similar. I don’t really have advice but I just wanna say to hang in there! Easier said than done and our generation NEEDS people like us, more than ever.</p>

        <p>You are a fantastic writer.  Are you really only 17?  </p>
<p>Listen.  Fuck these people.  The people doing this to us right now, are criminals to humanity.  </p>
<p>We will not get out of this by giving up or killing ourselves.  We will only get out of this by fighting.</p>
<p>Start doing some exercise.  I don't know how, but find a time in the morning if possible to do some exercise.  This will help you stabilize your inner mental anguish, and keep you focused on the real enemy: These mother fuckers in the government, and their allies and other conformists, who are destroying our society and our planet.</p>
<p>We need young people like you.  We need you bad.  Probably the majority of us here are around Generation X.  We're probably all like 35-45, and nobody gives a fuck what we think.  In fact, they hate us and treat us with disdain.  We're stuck in between a shit sandwich of Boomers and Millenials.</p>
<p>We need you to carry on the fight.  We need you to help change people's minds around you.  We need your demographic to start putting pressure.  Most of the conformists believe they are doing this for you, so that you have a future.  </p>
<p>Make sure they know you want to be able to choose your future.  Not cower under a cloud of fear.</p>
<p>Don't give up, please.  </p>
<p>Fight.  Fight goddammit.  Join with us and we will fight to our last breath to save this planet and save humanity.  You are not alone.  We need all hands on deck if we are to get out from under this tyranny.</p>
<p>PS - Definitely keep up the writing.  Consider keeping a journal where you write whatever first comes to your mind (don't share it with anyone).  That has personally helped me enormously.</p>
