    <strong>Does anyone else experience brief instances of surrealism with this whole thing?</strong>
    <p><p>I had a dream last night where I was in a bank talking to the teller. I walked out and saw people outside on the street talking, walking their dogs, ect. That was it. That was the dream.  </p>
<p>When I woke up I couldn't figure out why it was so strange. After all - It was probably about the most boring, lack-of-substance having imagery you could have. And then it hit me - No one was wearing masks. There was a deep feeling of longing, so to speak.   </p>
<p>When my dad died I remembered telling myself "The worst dreams are going to be the ones where life is normal, but when you wake up the nightmare is reality". Does that make sense?  </p>
<p>Even these public freakout videos. Just how the sight of someone's bare face can send people spiraling into a frenzy. Cameras drawn and ready to post you all over the internet as "Bruh this karen at my CVS bruh".  </p>
<p>There are people we've spoken to every day for months - at stores, work, ect... And you don't know what the bottom half of their face looks like.  </p>
<p>It's just.... so surreal. I am not saying this to be overly dramatic, it's only after you step back and assess the situation from the perspective of what once used to be - NORMALITY - do you see how bizarre things have become.</p></p>

        <p>This is part of the reason for the masks. Masks have been used for rituals since time immemorial. They enable the wearer to be transported into a new reality, make a new self. The surrealism is very much a part of it. Stay frosty, we are in a very dangerous situation.</p>

        <p>Look around you. This year has been the greatest period of change I've seen in my lifetime. Many things are changing. Small business has been nuked from orbit. Tech platforms are rapidly moving to censor all non-approved speech. Millions are about to be evicted.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that you can find many examples of cultures in the past wearing masks during a transformative ritual. I believe the sense of surrealism you are seeing is partly (and purposely) caused by the mask wearing. Masquerades, peruvian shamans, halloween. Covering ones face leads to a sense of newness, and to your point, a sense of surrealism.</p>
<p>Put most simply, the surrealism you're feeling is part of the plan. That way when crazy or fucked up shit happens, you are disassociated from it, and more likely to put up with it or not question it.</p>

        <p>Ah, okay. Understood.  </p>
<p>So now my question to you.  </p>
<p>I have a friend that insists that this horrible period (And soon to get progressively worse) is absolutely part of a plan to instill a new world. No, not The NWO, but a better world.  </p>
<p>The optimism is great, but I don't think it's realism. Is it fair to say that this new world you're speaking of is an even more so dystopian one? And that this ritual is not in our favor?</p>

        <p>There are many interpretations of what is coming. One of them is of the great reset. That one is pretty in the open, they even have a website and everything. Maybe that's what your friends is referring to, seeing as how it's been discussed by many mainstream figures/youtubers.</p>
<p>\&rt; Is it fair to say that this new world you're speaking of is an even more so dystopian one? </p>
<p>Well, one really doesn't know, but it doesn't sound great. Think about who would be pushing a new world. And if they're the kind of people to do so by impoverishing millions? Destroying lives? Doesn't lend a lot of confidence they have a great utopian vision. Utopian for us peasants anyways.</p>
<p>\&rt; And that this ritual is not in our favor?</p>
<p>I would say any ritual performed with great fear, pain, suffering and duplicity is not generally in one's favor. To me, positive change comes from the other spectrum. Light, not darkness. Knowledge, not ignorance. Discussion, not censorship.</p>

        <p>Even if we don't get the dystopian NWO in the end, any "better" world installed after this would be a massive con. It's like burning someone's house down so you can sell them a wet cardboard box to live in. If they have to destroy humanity--and I mean the <em>best</em> of what humanity has to offer, not just the bad stuff--in order for people to buy their "new, improved world", then it must be some garbage shit nobody would ever consider otherwise.</p>

        <p>I was watching a show earlier and a guy walked into a restaurant and for a split second I like " oh shit he doesn't have a mask on what is he thinking" and realized how rediculous that was.. I dont even believe in these mask mandates and yet its becoming to imbedded in all of us that even seeing people's bare faces on old shows is taboo..</p>

        <p>Yes! Watching videos from less than a year ago. Comments rife with "Man, look at the pre-covid world!". It's just like THE NEW NORMAL. The more you say Pre-Covid, and NEW NORMAL  - the easier it is to usher this dystopian nightmare into reality. In a sense, you're admitting that it's really coming true.</p>

        <p>Yes, I dream every night of normality. I dream of events with many people or big public spaces with maskless crowds. I dreamt of running with my best friend down a hill without a mask and I was scared that other people will see me and get angry. And my best friend said, don't worry, nobody wear masks anymore, it's okay... Needless to say, I was late for work that morning because I didn't want to wake up.</p>

        <p>I had a vivid dream last night where I was a cop and was flirting with a school teacher. It was one of the most surreal dreams Iâ€™ve ever had. I still remember her face, no mask, smiling at me, laughing at my dumb jokes. </p>
<p>I was so pissed when I woke up lol. Like wtf man, ughhh what is this clown world...</p>

<p>2020 as a whole feels like a Kafkaesque, Orwellian nightmare I can't seem to be able to wake up from.</p>

        <p>With all the analogies being aimed toward 1984 I completley forgot how fitting Kafka's The Trial is also to this situation.</p>

        <p>Saturday a man bumped into my car and slightly damaged it in front of me while parking. After spending half an hour filling the regular paperwork and insurance details I asked him to shake hands and he gladly accepted. This amicable handshake with a complete stranger felt really good. This is something that doesnâ€™t happen anymore and we should launch a handshaking movement. Nothing prevents you from sanitizing your hands afterwards but at least this a way to say I want to keep on having normal human interactions.</p>
