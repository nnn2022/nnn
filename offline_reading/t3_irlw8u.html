        <p>I was thinking today about this great old TED talk by Johann Hiri about the social connection theory of addiction and the "Rat Park" experiments.  Very, very interesting stuff if you've never seen it.  The obvious implications for addicts (new and old) of the faceless, dehumanized, and "socially-distanced" world that's been pushed for the past six months are pretty awful.  </p>
<p>&rt;The data is preliminary and could be adjusted before CDC finalizes the numbers later this year. However, Anderson said, <strong>"It seems that 2019 is the new high for drug overdose deaths."</strong> He explained, "[The] [d]ata is still provisional at this point, but the increase in the last few months of 2019 was steep enough to push it over the top by a little more than 200 deaths."</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Data suggest 2020 could be worseâ€”particularly because of Covid-19</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Separate data suggests that America already is seeing increases in its number of drug-related overdose deaths in 2020 when compared with 2019. For example, <strong>an analysis released by the White House last month found that overdose deaths were up by 11.4% from January to April of this year when compared with the same period in 2019.</strong></p>

<p>I'd be very surprised if 2020 isn't worse (as the numbers just through <em>April</em> already suggest it will be), but it won't be "because of COVID-19."  It'll be in no small part because of our hysterical and insanely-disproportionate <em>response</em> to COVID-19. Lockdowns and anti-human "social distancing" don't just destroy quality of life; they kill.</p>
<p>Maybe they should do a new set of experiments where the isolated rats can see each other via Zoom calls?</p>

        <p>I remember reading about thr Rat Park experiment years ago but hadn't thought of it in ages. Brilliant to bring it up in connection with lockdowns, it's a perfect illustration of (what should be obvious about) their effects on mental health and addiction.</p>
