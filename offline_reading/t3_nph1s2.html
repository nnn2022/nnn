    <strong>Pray for Brazil</strong>
    <p><p>We have 26 states, and ALL of our governors are pro-dystopia. President Bolsonaro has the right mindset about this scam but he can't do shit about anything without being invalidated by our corrupt-filled Supreme Court. Of course there are other things he COULD do, but he's not brave enough. 
Here in Bahia, the state i was born and raised, our governor's just trying random bullshit at this point.
Literally no advances were made despite 20% of the population being jabbed with the first shot, and to be honest, i don't really expect any even in a whole semester.</p>
<p>Open, close, open, close, open, close, open, close...</p></p>

        <p>I believe Bolonaro is playing the same card Trump did.  He complains about it and says all the right things but doesnt do shit about it other than complain.  Its the perfect sedative for the masses.  As long as people <em>think</em> there is somebody rooting for them, it leads to complacency in the hopes that he will do something about it.  As you've said, he has the power to do some things but he hasnt because he's too cowardly.  Well, I hate to break it to you, that's not the reason.  All of this shit is going down under his watch, just like it did under Trump here in the states.  Trump refused to end the state of emergency which gave unprecedented powers to the government, He paraded Birx and Fauci up at the white house podium daily to have them promote their lies.  He challenged it in words only.  He never used his powers as the president to preserve any of our freedoms.  And his Magnum Opus, he came up with operation warp speed which produced a vaccine that will likely wipe out a large fraction of the population.  Trump was a shill.  Bosenaro is a shill.  The fact is you do not become Prime Minister, or President of a country without selling your soul.</p>
