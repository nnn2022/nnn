    <strong>I'm Sorry....</strong>
    <p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>The amount of anxiety I have right now is rampant due to this on going battle I have had going on in my head the past few months. I am huge on not getting the vaccine, and the university I attend is basically going to alienate you if you do not get it.  It will make my life so much easier if I just bite the bullet and get the one shot. I do not like what is going on in the world, and actually quite disgusted. If I do end up getting the vaccine, it is because of what is going on in my personal life, not because I think it essential for health and forcing it on to those who do not want it. I will still advocate against it and continue to read this sub daily and learn new things. I am forever grateful for ya'll with keeping me up to date on current events and opening up new minds. I do not know why but I feel like a disappointment and I am sorry.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, the vaccine wont make the anxiety go away. The anxiety is because you know that the walls of tyranny are closing in, and we are going to have to do something about it soon. </p>
<p>This is going to be the fight that defines the next century; do we truly value individual rights and freedom, or do we submit to an authority to control our lives and our bodies? </p>
<p>Most people are in your position. They just want to keep their heads down, hoping the world goes back to what it was before. But if we give our rights up now, we will not see them retaken by the individual in our lifetime. </p>
<p>Do what is right for you. If you dont want the vaccine, no one can make you take it. Stand up.</p>

        <p>I'm pro-choice. Though I would advocate making health decisions for health reasons - everyone still has the right to choose.</p>
<p>If you do choose to do it, don't live with regret. In order to avoid regret you need to be comfortable with the scenario the rules change and your vaccination has no bearing returning any of your individual liberties (like we see in CA, USA with masks for example). You also need to be comfortable with the possibility that you will be required to keep having booster shots for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>There is an immense pressure on people to get a vaccine if it affects work/ study. That is for sure. and yeah it does play on my mind a lot.</p>
<p>My advice would be to make a decision you are comfortable with and to hold out until the very latest moment - because these restrictions are not set in stone yet.</p>

        <p>Don't apologize, there's no need. You need to choose what's best for you. Maybe get some advice from your primary healthcare and/or mental health care provider, too.
I am happy that you state so clearly that you won't go full authoritarian and will still respect that everybody should make their own choices.
It's important not to beat yourself up about it in case you do get it. A lot of people understand that this societal pressure that is being exerted upon certain groups (such as students) is unfair, disproportional and unethical.
I don't know the reason of your hesitancy up until now, be it for philosophical, medical, political or other reasons. Just make sure to think the argument through, because whichever choice you make, you should be okay with it. It could be that you change your mind later in light of new information, and if that happened, it would be great for you to be able to say "Although now I think differently, I did think this through and with the knowledge I had back then, I'd take the same path again."
Best of luck!</p>

        <p>It sounds like you' re gonna crack and get it. Sounds like you're making the proclamation you are too weak to resist the outcome of standing steadfastly against it. Yet from you're heart you wish to stay with us. Those who hate the mechanism of control this actually is. I just want to say we need you and losing you to that side is beyond bad. Please consider throwing everything away to remain with us. You cannot come back if you go and I fear the new family you adopt will not appeal to you. Remember it's one thing to be and another to identify. Right now you BE long with us. But once you go it will only be an attempt to identify with us from then on as we did not cave to the evil of the world. Consider seeing us when we cant buy groceries while you can. Its better for you to share in our sufferings than take a price on you're soul. Please turn you're I'm sorry around to a I will not be sorry. And.... You won't.</p>

        <p>I received a flu shot to attend college (not as terrifying as these vaccines, but not without risk) and I ended up being one of the "rare" people to have a life-threatening reaction that changed the course of my life. As in, spent a year learning how to relearn basic functions at a rehab center for a year. Since then, I have had to get several other vaccines out of necessity, like tetanus and the rabies series. Each time, I had a "rare" reaction that necessitated emergent medical intervention. My immune system turns on me when they inject vaccines due to the adjuvant, because it aggravates the immune system, which elicits a response. This is a real potential problem for people with underlying autoimmune issues, which I wasn't even aware I had until it was too late. </p>
<p>You can't undo something once it's done. All you can do is live with the consequences, if there are any, and play the hand you're dealt. What I can say is that choosing to make that decision consciously-because you wanted to, not because you were pressured-makes an enormous difference in your mental state. </p>
<p>I hate that I got pressured into taking a flu vaccine I didn't need. I do not hate that I had a bad reaction to a series of rabies shots I definitely did need. Make sure it's your decision and do your best to assess whether the risk is worth it to you personally. </p>
<p>I personally will never take a covid vaccine, even though I am at risk of becoming quite ill from covid due to my vaccine-induced autoimmune conditions. It's a hill I will die on, but I'm in my thirties and have lived a little bit more of life than you. </p>
<p>Whatever you decide, I hope you feel at ease with yourself and your decision.</p>

        <p>Most universities allow a leave of absence for up to one year. This situation is going to look a lot different in year’s time—hell, maybe even by this winter. Please for your own sake take the chance to take some time off to decide what you want to do with your life. Get some internships, a job in your field, bolster your resume. Then you can come back to school when you do with a better sense of where you’re going in life as well as perspective on the vaccine fallout. It’s a win-win situation. Whatever you do, if you take a leave of absence, spend that time doing things that are beneficial toward your future.</p>
