    <strong>I'm so sad that things are forever changed.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a central part of the UK.  Let me just remind you that wearing masks outdoors in the UK has <em>never</em> been mandated, aside from those who are 'clinically vulnerable'.  </p>
<p>I'll also add that I don't wear a mask outside of supermarkets (where big security guards <em>force</em> you to) and on public transport (where the bus driver will <em>literally</em> pull over, get out of his seat, and go and have a cigarette outside while the entire bus has to figure out themselves why he has done this - yep, it's because someone pulled their mask down to wipe their nose). This is a true story, by the way.  It happened to someone I know. So good luck 'standing up' to those people.  </p>
<p>I use public transport and supermarkets for the <em>bare minimum</em> for me to be able to earn money and eat.  For this, I have to wear a mask for about 45 minutes each day.  I have never worn one outside, and never will, even if mandated (which it will be in November, I'm guessing).</p>
<p>Anyway.  As I walk the approximate half-mile journey from my bus stop to work, there's a lot more people around since stores opened again.  I would say that approximately 30% of people are wearing masks.  As depressing as this is, it didn't prepare me for when I changed my walking route, one that passed where some schools were.</p>
<p>I would say, and this is just me gauging statistics with my eyes here, that approximately 90-95% of kids aged (roughly) between 13-17 wear masks outdoors.  About 50% of these look like they've just accepted it, and see nothing at all wrong with it, and the other 50% seem to actually think it's badass, like they're a ninja or something.</p>
<p>I keep forgetting how young, young people are, and that I can't remember how my brain worked at that age (I'm nearly 50).  But it seems like conformity is genuinely becoming the new cool, for most of the young generation.  I can't relate to the fact that they grew up entirely looking at 'news' and opinions on a glass screen they kept in their pocket, that beeped and buzzed when it wanted to tell them something new.  They say zealots have the voice of 'god' in their heads; the room is the same with different wallpaper - a voice in your head may as well be a voice in your pocket; it still reaches your head...</p>
<p>We are, in my humble opinion, only a few months away from younger generations actively mocking those who don't conform.  Just as people my age when they were young mocked 'the square' or those who were 'teacher's pet' and followed all the rules, instead nowadays the young mock those who don't follow the narrative; they've twisted it so that a Bear Grylls-looking dude, mask free and probably making fire with a couple of stones and some hay, is an 'utterly sad twat', and probably think it's 'snort through the nose laugh' kinda funny that he has a 'weird phone' (non smartphone), is 'breathing his germs everywhere' (not wearing a mask) and is a bioterrorist (deliberately not getting a vaccine that is 'only there to help people').</p>
<p>Now you might pipe in at this point and say 'not all young...' and I believe you.  But let's face it, you are on Reddit, and as you know, it's not super representative of the real world.  Those percentages I gave are probably on the low side...I even thought this as I calculated...  Did I not look at that group over there?  They were wearing masks too.  Did I deliberately choose to not see a mother and her child both wearing masks and face shields as they sat opposite each other on the bus; the mother having succeeded in normalising this farcical cruelty, a nervous smile appearing on her daughter as her breath fogged up her shield.</p>
<p>I'd been wary that spending too much time online had been giving me a false sense of doom about people in the outside world (and I'm speaking mainly about the UK here), but what I've seen in the real world has saddened me even further.</p>
<p>I can only hope that a new trend flushes the 'coolness' of mask wearing down the toilet, in the case of the young.  However, I don't see this happening any time soon, and coupled with the fact that school age kids can be uncomfortable about their looks, I see nothing to dissuade them from normalising mask wearing.</p>
<p>I've even heard conversations as I have passed some walking in the other direction.  They genuinely don't care; it's so normalised for them that they genuinely do think we're making a fuss over nothing by not wearing them.  I don't even think it's malice, just plain ignorance and gullibility.  And I've heard women rejoice that they no longer have to spend so much on makeup, having effectively 'given up' on the lower half of their face, and delighting in fashion-masking.  The fact that all of the types of masks they wear do absolutely nothing (even less than the do-absolutely-nothing actual masks) means, you got it, absolutely nothing to them too.  There's a cognitive dissonance whereby it's long passed that there was any actual scientific reason to wear a mask; the fundamental thing to them is that they were told to wear them so "oh okay then" is their natural response.  </p>
<p>This is a generation, remember, that never experienced rebellion prior to cOvId either; their parents let them do what they wanted and weren't permitted (or chose not) to discipline them.  Conformity is all they've ever known.  </p>
<p>I think this will last for ever (now that our first 'test' of submission to our overlords has been passed) - if not in this guise of covid, than in whatever virtue-signalling-friendly behemoth is being, as we speak, concieved and prepared to succeed it.  We will rebel, as it is our nature.  However this nature is being diluted in younger generations.  You may all be thinking "no fucking way will I ever yada yada, etc, eyc, and neither will my kids..."  But what about <em>their</em> kids?  And their <em>grandkids</em>?</p>
<p>I'm single and haven't even felt the contact of another hand on my own for 15 months.  I've tried to be optimistic.  I miss the old world like I lost a brother.  f I wasn't so scared of pain and stuff, I'd seriously consider ending it all.  </p>
<p>I don't want this fart joke of a world, all the beauty and sophistication that it had to offer having been callously amputated forever.  Lockdowns may end, mask wearing may turn into something else, but <em>nuance</em>, <em>impulsivity</em> and <em>whimsy</em> have died.  Most people will forever question whether they're 'allowed' to do whatever they're currently doing, and not even necessarily because of fear of what authorities may do or say, but for fear of repecussions from their neighbours and friends.</p>
<p>I wish I had the strengh to fight against this but I'm increasingly running out of ideas when the whole next generation is finding us stupid for even wanting to rebel against it. </p>
<p>Anyway, I love you guys.  I'd have left this world already if I thought I was the only one who could see through all this insanity.  I literally know <em>no-one</em> in the real world like us.</p></p>

        <p>Same here. I never wear My fking mask because for a disease of 99.7% survival rate, and plus with so many studies done that masks don't do shi, I don't. I only have to wear it in stores as they can permanently ban Me, so I have to. But, some based stores let Me in as the ppl who have common sense know this all is bs.</p>
<p>But I live in Canada. Every other person here is fat, wierd color hair, and has a whole army of beta males who virtue signal and double mask like a good boy to make their crushes and Master (the Gov) "proud." So, I remember once in line, I take My mask off as I'm fking dying of the heat and the guy behind Me (fat, Male Feminist type) screams that "it's because of guys like Me covid has spread." On the contrary, I'm young and very healthy and havw no health problem whatsoever, and I maintained My distance but yet he had to scream and make everyone aware I took off my mask. Everyone started looking at Me like I'm from a different planet so I just did My thing and got out.</p>
<p>I literally cannot meet people that think on the same mindset and level as Me. It's very lonely. And with all this lockdowns, it really has an affect on your mental health. I don't talk with dumb people and finding very mature and wise people in this ðŸ¤¡ world is very hard.  That's why I love this sub as alot of us have very identical values, upbringing and thinking.</p>

        <p>I can tell you this: I have 2 young kids and I'm <em>actively</em> teaching them that this is all garbage.</p>
<p>Those of us with kids own the future and determine how this will ultimately play out. Teach them to hate the government and reject societal norms.</p>
<p>If anything, all this crap will actually have the opposite effect on younger generations who think it's stupid. </p>
<p>It's ultimately just the boomers and millenials who are driving this shit.</p>

        <p>I am doing the same. My oldest (7) has really taken to activism now against masks and distancing at her school! Itâ€™s taken some work to temper down her plans, but her teacher seams to like her outspokenness and has encouraged her to speak her mind (while not disrupting active class).</p>
<p>Weâ€™re in a wealthy public district in the NE so I take some hope in the fact not everyone is crazy and count my blessings for getting a great teacher! </p>
<p>An aside. Wealthy districts seam to get in person classes back faster than poor districts out here. Goes to show what happens when the parents have more power in the education game even in clown land</p>

        <p>Had a lady on the bus the other day go mental because of mask exempt people being on the bus. After she made a huge fuss an Irish lad on the bus shouted to the bus driver to ask him to clarify what the bus drivers powers are in this position, the bus driver responded it's a personal choice and he cannot enforce it. </p>
<p>This elderly ladies head nearly exploded and she even swore at people when she got off of the bus. Quality entertainment.</p>

<p>The problem is that they genuinely believe they are being rebellious when in fact the government, big corporations and all of Hollywood backs them. The media has successfully managed to repackage mindless obedience and sold it to them as rebellious/counter culture.</p>

        <p>I'm a teenager in the UK and lots of teenagers are like this, just do as they are told. Maybe because I grew up in Brazil so I don't trust the government or corporations and am used to more freedom. Teenagers here can't think for themselves, they just parrot the media basically. Even when you point out the pure lies they believe and use their own state approved sources they just continue to believe what the media tells them. Also they hate people who have their own ideas if they are not approved ideas, they really get angry almost violent. Just mind slaves or maybe they don't have a soul. Western people are the most pathetic people on this planet if you ask me, excluding you guys. Maybe we will move back to Brazil within a year, at least I hope so.</p>

        <p>Very well written, thank you. I'm only 18 and it's seriously depressing that this is now the world we are living in, and the future I have to look forward to. I suppose I'm lucky that I got to have a relatively normal, happy childhood in a time when people were still relatively free and the world and society was still relatively good, but at the same time, it makes all of this so much harder to deal with. When I tell others that I'm grieving, in a way, the loss of the past, I'm met with statements such as 'well things always change, the future will never be like the past!'; they don't understand that I'm not just grieving the loss of childhood, or certain objects, or places, I'm grieving the loss of life as it should be, and the person I used to be, with real dreams and hopes for the future, unburdened by what I now know is coming. There's none of that anymore. I try not to lose hope, but it's difficult. A lot of people think I'm scared, but I'm not, not really. I'm just sad.</p>

        <p>So basically you do what everyone else in the U.K. does. You wear a mask when required. Well done. What will you do in the Summer when masks are probably not going to be needed any more? Will you have to find something else to worry about?</p>

        <p>People wear masks because they've been told to, and most people would rather conform than play the outcast. It's like smoking. That's becoming more and more socially unacceptable and people are treated like outcasts.</p>
<p>You may think people are sheep for conforming. They probably are. But most people don't see a problem in it. They'd rather fit in with society and not be seen as different or unusual.</p>
<p>It's worth remembering that most people don't care about masks. They wear them because it's easy, and doesn't really cause a hardship. People can breathe fine, it's not uncomfortable, they're really cheap, so it's not even something people care enough about to rebel against.</p>
<p>I understand that a group of people don't like being told what to do. But think about it. We're all told what to do on a daily basis anyway. Your boss sets you tasks. You have to pay bills on time. You have to get licences to drive. You have to leave pubs by certain times, and can't drink before 12 noon. You can't play loud music after 10pm or drink on the street.</p>
<p>Everyone is told what to do almost every minute of every day. Masks might be another thing so most people just don't care.</p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s the issue though. People will just do whatever they are told without stopping and thinking for a moment. Itâ€™s why the government hold all the cards here in the UK. As it stands this isnâ€™t over until they say itâ€™s over.</p>

        <p>How about the very strange and real issue of not seeing people's faces/smiles? Losing that important form of non-verbal communication?</p>
<p>All my friends who have had children in this past year note that their babies are terrified of maskless people and have social anxiety.</p>
<p>What about the fact that it is based on compliance and not medicine. Sure, this particular thing may be easy for you to comply with but then the hurdles you have to jump in order to comply keep growing, for example we all MUST comply and get a vaccine, we all MUST comply to booster shots, lockdowns, vaccine passports etc and this seems to just be the start!</p>
<p>The masks are allowing virtue signaling turning neighbours and citizens against each other.  I respect those who are standing up and saying this doesn't smell right, we do not need masks if we are healthy.</p>

        <p>I've had a baby in lockdown. She doesn't care.</p>
<p>I think the issue is - it's a small thing that people are being asked to do. I know this sub doesn't like discussion, hence the downvotes - but wearing a mask and getting a vaccine is a fairly reasonable request.</p>
<p>If we were being asked to do unreasonable or damaging things, I'd agree with you. But no one is being asked to kill someone. It's wearing some fabric while in shops and stuff. Don't have to wear it outdoors. Can still eat with friends and talk. It's a small amount of situations that require a mask.</p>
<p>And the vaccine just makes sense. Even if you're low risk, why not get something that helps you. Literally no argument against it makes sense. If you get scratched by a rusty screw, you'd probably get a tetanus shot. Babies get given jabs against chicken pox and measles and mumps and rubella. It's just sensible.</p>

        <p>It all starts with the "little things." Stanley Milgram's Obedience to Authority is good reading and provides a great insight into the human mind. This psychological experiment in the 1960s showed human obedience to a perceived authority. Individuals would be instructed to press a button that would increasingly hurt, injure, and even lead to the death of another person. They may call out in protest, but still do it. This is Milgram's experiment, en masse. One day it's masks, the next day injections, the next day manning checkpoints, and what's next is anybody's guess.</p>

        <p>No one is saying we should obey authority in 100% of cases. You're quite a fringe sub that is probably on Reddits list to take down at some point because of the inaccuracies over a global health issue so you guys know that you hold some fairly extreme views. That's no surprise to anyone.</p>
<p>But even the people that massively disagree with you wouldn't say we should blindly follow authority. Plenty of people went on marches against governments for poll tax (UK) and wars etc.</p>
<p>So it's not as clear cut as "everyone's following authority and its depressing". There's gradations.</p>
<p>People simply don't regard being asked to wear a mask or have a vaccine as that unreasonable. It's worth not a fight. Or, more likely, they agree. It's not an authority request, it's something people actively want for themselves.</p>
<p>When the topic of racism or wars or police brutality etc come up, a lot more people speak out. Because that is unreasonable and worth the fight. People aren't sheep then.</p>
<p>I get you want to have your opinions and not be led by authority. But masks and vaccines are the wrong thing to push back on.</p>
