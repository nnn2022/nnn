    <strong>Remember guys, 2020 is over which means things will get better! Welcome 2021!</strong>
    <p><p>Tired of hearing this shit. Nature and the governments don't care what year it is: there is no sign of coronavirus, fearmongering, or the lockdowns going away any time soon.</p>
<p>Do people have any real sense of logic anymore? Just because 2020 is over does NOT mean things will get better. The world doesn't work that way.</p></p>

        <p>Nah it’s gonna get better for me because I’m gonna make it. I’m sick of laying around all day being depressed and staring at Reddit. Not to be all toxic positivity or whatever but it’s time to take life into my own hands</p>

        <p>I've been trying to take my life in my own hands for months now, and trying to live as normally as possible. It just isn't working, and it's not the same as before. Maybe it's just my location, but the mandates and general insanity of the people around me has made life very unpleasant for me. </p>
<p>I want to believe 2021 will be better, it's just really difficult. OP is right, it doesn't seem to be getting better. Didn't some countries enact harsher restrictions in the last few days?</p>

        <p>They did and it’s horrible, it still really pisses me off but I have to get off this sub and focus on my life and family. I’m sorry for what you’re going through and trust me I’ve been there. I just can’t do it any more, I might be able to start working again soon and I’ve got to focus on that and stuff that’s going on with my family.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's this sub's fault that things are depressing. The world is not in a very good state right now, and people are becoming more radicalized. Tensions in society have never been higher than they are right now. I'm not sure where you live, but taking a step outside my house, I find a much different world than what was around exactly one year ago. That's what depresses me, not so much this sub, but the fact people have allowed and even embrace the current state of affairs.</p>

        <p>True. The only reason I’m ok is because I moved across the country to be around family and friends. Not trying to speak for anyone else, only myself. Had I not moved I would have ended my life driving off a bridge by now so I understand. I just have to try to move forward personally. I understand not everyone has that opportunity and I wish you all the best.</p>
