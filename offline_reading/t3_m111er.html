        <p>I know correlation aint causation, but everytime I am forced to put my mask from chin to over my nose for a bit longer than few seconds I get a strep throat soon after. People dont realize how fast those rags become dirty and filled with bacteria.</p>

        <p>Yeah a lot of people don’t wash them, and they’re constantly touching their face to adjust them.  I once saw this nurse’s post on faecesbook where she breathed on two petri dishes, one with and one without a mask, and the one she breathed on without a mask grew bacteria, and the other one didn’t.  She then claimed this was proof for all anti-maskers that masks definitely worked and they could all shut up - but, that’s... such a limited experiment!  Everyone in the comments bought it, but honestly, it proves NOTHING about whether masks are effective on a large scale, for a prolonged period of time etc.</p>

        <p>The question is, where all the bacteria went xD. Maybe it got stuck on the piece of fabric they religiously wear and knowing how bad mouth hygiene is for the average person, a nasty suprise might be around the corner. Nothing novel about it, but could be way nastier than covid in most cases. Might even come in as a combo with covid, because as we all know, masks do shit when it comes to viral particles.</p>

        <p>I have to wear one at work, and school, but I just wear one that sticks out a bit farther, and is completely open under my chin. It looks just like a normal mask (albeit somewhat more beak-like,) and none of the doomers have said anything to me yet.</p>

        <p>Wait do you not buy disposable ones? I alternate between using disposable and cloth ones. I usually do my 10k with a disposable mask on, and then for normal every day activities, i use a cloth mask, but that mask goes straight in the laundry basket at the end of each day.</p>

        <p>Just reflecting on the fact that this week marks the 1-year anniversary of the social beginning of...all this. March 11 2020 is when the WHO formally declared a pandemic, and when the White House first formally addressed the natjon regarding the coronavirus. </p>
<p>Crazy how the mood in this country shifted from normal to SHTF in the span of a few days. Remember laughing about how Corona beer sales were down because some idiots thought it was related to the virus somehow? Remember "boomer remover"? The last time I went to a bar normally was Friday, March 13. Normally I would go out for happy hour on Fridays with my coworker friends, but that day, most of them got spooked and went straight home after work. Only one co-worker and his gf went out with me, we were laughing that the others were being paranoid, and planning how to convince them to come out for St Patrick's Day at the Irish bar we were at. By St Patrick's Day, that bar was closed. Along with literally everything else except the grocery stores, whose shelves were half empty. </p>
<p>Also reflecting how I, embarrassingly, got caught up in the doom and hysteria myself, but only for about a month tops, and never to an extreme. Sad how some people seem to have never adjusted their level of fear a whole year later.</p>

        <p>Is anyone else just jaded as fuck? Honestly Idk if I can not be jaded. I don’t like living like this honestly, don’t get me wrong, but it’s all I know. I am cordial/civil and know what is appropriate but I’m not friendly, I’m cold/reserved. I’m very narcissistic but not in the I’ll bully other people to get what I want sort of way. I guess you can say I think I’m a quote on quote special snowflake.</p>
<p>I’m just pissed off... feel like I’ve been fucked over so many times in my life, I’m pissed off for being poor (trying to change that), from being molested from like age 3-5?6?, for moving all the time growing up which has caused me to not have any friends. I just fucking am not happy. I think I have bipolar, maybe slight (but functioning?) schizophrenia from all the LSD, mushrooms, and weed I’ve done. I’m just annoyed at life and society. Will this shit ever get better or am I going to live in a slightly depressed state of mind forever?</p>

<p>Here's a few thousand videos of the successful people of the world flashing their gang signs showing you who they worship. Yeah, "coincidence".... I always cover half my or cover one eye with a piece of fruit, throw up the "A ok" (it's really 666 but people are naive), stick out my tongue and throw up devil horns, etc when someone points a camera at me.</p>

        <p>Vent
im so damn tiered. i haven't lost much financially or anyone in my family cause i'm still a kid but i had goals i had places to go. I feel like it's just gonna stay like this forever like there's no end goal. just keep us all like this forever. i miss when everything was normal, I miss the little things even something like seeing someone's full face in a grocery store feels like something out of a fucking dream. and everyone just says it's for others safety. i'm sure this makes me a selfish prick but i don't care anymore. My country is giving vaccines at a snails pace and it'll prob take forever to actually get something done. I just want to go swimming and see people and go in a normal classroom and work on projects together. i just want things to go back to how they were. And the worst part is that initially i was happy about this. "two" extra weeks to march break turned into a year of bullshit.
im so done with this but i know i can't do anything
Thank you for having a place for ppl to vent i needed this</p>

        <p>You know what?  My son is 16, almost 17, and I get this same kind of vibe from him.  I will tell you what I tell him:  Be vocal.  If your friends are brainwashed, try to undo it.  Talk to everyone about how it's bullshit.  Teachers, bosses, etc.  Don't give up.  Don't be silent.  Don't consent to having your future stolen.  If you are silent, and don't fight, then you are complicit.</p>
<p>Good luck, kid. It must suck to be young and think your future is at risk because of this bullshit.</p>

        <p>I’m so fucking pissed. This week I found out my graduation is virtual... my last year of college was stolen from me. I’m absolutely fuming with anger. I know it’s silly but this moment of graduating college means a lot to me and it means a lot to other families. Also very lazy on my colleges part for not making more of an effort for making it happen. But NOOOO there are guidelines to follow. I hate my state (Virginia) and it’s stupid rules. I hate that the doomers are allowed to dictate our lives.</p>

        <p>Sorry.  My son is a HS Junior.  Football season a total shitshow, but it's even worse for the HS Seniors.  I imagine it's the same for college Seniors.</p>
<p>Remember this for the rest of your life.  Don't be a lemming follower.  Question everything.  Don't trust politicians.  Follow the money.  I know it sucks to suffer from a life lesson, but the worst thing for you would to become a sheep.  Take something positive from this, and become a free-thinking wolf.</p>

        <p>If you need to vacate America entirely, then perhaps Mexico or parts of Brazil. </p>
<p>But there are now many places in America that look like a better bet than leaving the country.</p>

        <p>I have considered staying in the USA, but finding a place where people are more open and more involved with each other instead of the "modern" life. I am a progressive. I already did the move to the middle of nowhere thing, lived in an extreme rural town that was led into Qanon nonsense and voting for their own demise.  That didn't work out. The town died while I was there. 37 percent poverty rate probably 50 post Covid if not more. Got any suggestions. I need some community.</p>

        <p>Progressives who are against shutdowns are in a tough spot right now. Among my friends, the more progressive people are invariably pro lockdown while the more conservative folks think this is an enormous pile of bullshit. That said, politics need not be a deal breaker between friends. We know a couple who moved to Gilbert AZ a few years ago and love it. They're moderately progressive and their family is thriving and making friends in a variety of places. So, perhaps you could look there.</p>

        <p>I live in northern Ca in a town that I can go out without a mask with no problem. I’m having to take a bullshit class in a town 2 hours away for the next 4 weeks. Today I went for a run without my mask on their local trails. Every time that I ran past someone except for once they pulled mask out to cover their face as I ran by. These people are scared to death. Fml. I can’t walk through the hotel without a mask here but you can smoke a cig inside the resteraunt 🤷🏿‍♂️</p>

        <p>The masking outside shit is the biggest hoax put upon mankind, can't believe there are people that believe in that. And good fucking luck getting a good workout with a mask on, fucking dumbasses don't realize they are getting less oxygen when they do that. Oxygen is very vital to your brains health.</p>

        <p>Since 30% of the US has German ancestry, I don't think that it is a good idea to remind people of Nazi Germany when you are making an argument against masks and lockdowns. Of course, you can say that the Germans are proud of their Autobahn and German cooking, it just isn't the same as others' pride of heritage because of the history of the war and how almost every German took part by not doing anything to stop it. And it has also been surmounted that German culture is basically cowardly in its avarice toward individualism. Of course, every culture and society has deep flaws and embarrassing records, but none quite as bad as the Germans have had since WWII.</p>

        <p>Tonight I had the thought that covid was/is a decoy—a diversion operation. 
But I don’t have an idea what from. So maybe I’m out in left field.
But suddenly is ok to gather maskless if we’ve been vaccinated, etc, yet still we are told DO NOT TRAVEL.  <br>
Not that it’s ok to travel only if you’ve been vaccinated, just do not travel period. So my spidey senses say they’ve been diverting the attention of society from something and it’s related to travel somehow.</p>

        <p>I want you guys to stay safe. But seriously, 500,000 people dead. More than that, in fact. This isn't something to be politicized, we need to take action. "B-but muh freedoms!" I fucking know. It ain't fun. But would you rather be slightly inconvenienced or have the possibility of your family and friends dying? You all complain about this lasting longer than everyone said it would, and THAT IS BECAUSE OF YOU. I can't fucking believe how stupid  the human race can be. Please, wear your masks. It really isn't that hard to understand, is it?</p>

        <p>It's not about you. It was never about you. I can't wait until science supports us taking off the mask and embracing each other, shaking hands, seeing smiles again. I'm right there with you.</p>
<p>'Pretend to protect a few'. Imagine 9/11 every day for 150+ days straight. In the US alone. A few?</p>
<p>But somehow it's all about you 'conforming'. We aren't upset that you won't 'listen to us'. We don't think that you need to obey 'us' (us meaning normal everday citizens). Some of us privately or publicly think that you are folks who couldn't see the meaning in your lives, got upset when changes happened that you couldn't handle, and your means of coping with it is to pretend that you're above it all and able to see things others can't.</p>
<p>People are trying to save lives. This means lots of things had to change, from 'a piece of fabric over your face' to people having serious trouble with their jobs, rents, etc. Guess what? Rent doesn't matter to someone who dies. Would you rather lose your job or lose both your job and your dad?</p>
<p>I have no medical training. But I trust the educational process that those who do go through. I trust that their choice of career is partially or wholly motivated by a desire to save lives, your own included. I accept that things are gonna be very bad and very hard for a lot of people. But instead of crapping in my hands and throwing it at people (rhetorically), I'm doing my best to stay positive and looking forward to a different time.</p>
<p>If you need any kind of help, find somewhere to ask. Many people are doing their best, and in the face of the pandemic it's often not enough to make things 'normal'. But we need to accept what we can and move forward into tomorrow.</p>
