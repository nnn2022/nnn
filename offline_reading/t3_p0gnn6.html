    <strong>We have been beaten, blackmailed, bullied, cancelled, censored, coerced, insulted, screamed at, segregated, shamed and threatened for questioning the narrative and refusing to comply with authoritarian government guidelines and unnecessary medical procedures. But sure, we're the bad guys...</strong>
    <p><p>Does it make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside knowing there are people suffering under the effects of languished lockdowns and insane rules that restrict them from seeing their friends and family, pushed to the brink of suicide? Does it get you hard watching peaceful protesters get run down and clubbed in the head by jack-booted, medieval pigs on horseback? Does it make you smile seeing the "For Sale" signs propped up in the windows of the small businesses you were content to let roll over and die, all so you could stay home and feel safe and let some peon Amazon delivery driver serf brave the "deadly pandemic" outside so he could bring you your fucking anal beads?</p>
<p>Do you really believe the ruthlessly and reliably corrupt government, media and pharmaceutical companies (who make their living off of you being sick, by the way) give two fucking shits about you or your Grandma? How many times do you need to witness the elites of the World swan about on private jets and attend parties, unmasked and breaking social distancing guidelines, for you to fucking realize THEY ARE FUCKING LAUGHING AT YOU. While you were letting Gran rot in a care home and refusing her basic human intimacy because of a spooky cold virus with a 99.9% survival rate, the politicians, celebrities and media hacks have probably been attending Eyes Wide Shut style orgies.</p>
<p>Now you want to punish those of us who see through the bullshit and can stand up for themselves. We don't bow to peer pressure, we don't pretend to care for virtue-signalling points, and we don't stand for fascist, segregationist policies that will only further divide people and cause widescale suffering the likes of which Covid could only fucking dream of. You mocked us for entertaining "conspiracy theories" like the Wuhan lab leak and vaccine passports. Now that it's out in the open you have the fucking cheek and gall to sneerily smirk and pretend like this was always how it was going to be. Fuck you.</p>
<p>Your precious clot-shots do fuck all and you're starting to finally figure that fucking fact out but instead of admitting this has all been an overblown, embarassing circus and you might have injected something into your system that could very well fucking kill you in the near-future you're going to double down and say it's somehow our fucking fault. You mock freedom, independent thought and individuality. It's a good thing you've dug a hole so fucking deep you've ended up in China, because that's right where you fucking belong. Good luck EVER climbing back out.</p></p>

        <p>It's not a massive fuck up. It was their plan all along. Pfizer's MRNA study began with injections April 2020. They had that shit cocked and loaded ready to roll. This entire thing was pre-planned and rolled out on TV.<br>

We are at war folks. Covid-19 is a meticulously designed <strong>premeditated</strong> crime against humanity designed to serve the agenda of the New World Order/Anti-church to complete the reset of society and to gain more control by restricting purchasing and travel. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/macron-s-vaccine-passport-backed-by-french-constitutional-court">French President Emmanuel Macron's vaccine passport was just upheld by France's Constitutional Court</a> and now <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210805-canada-s-quebec-province-to-introduce-vaccine-passport">Quebec has drawn up plans for a vaccine passport of its own</a>. It is being widely discussed by the major media outlets here in the US and I am 100% sure they will attempt to bring it here the US. Don Lemon on CNN is discussing that very thing openly.</p>

        <p>I live in Ontario and I’m just waiting for vaccine passports to be rolled out. Everyone is scared that our numbers for the entire f’ing province hit over 300 today. 90 or so cases in all of Toronto… And of course the unvaccinated are being blamed.</p>

<p>I remember back in March of 2020 thinking, "This better not become a whole thing". Then of course, it becomes a bigger, more grotesque monster than I ever could have imagined. I could have excused governments around the world for acting completely bonkers for those first 3-6 months, but now it's beyond humiliating to watch the little minions do Satan's work.</p>
