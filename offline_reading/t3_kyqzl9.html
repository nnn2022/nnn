    <strong>Brainwashing</strong>
    <p><p>I wonder if we have been subject to intense psychological manipulation rather than an actual pandemic. This is a list of what we have been subjected to since last year in the UK. </p>
<p>· If you go on the internet, there are endless articles about the coronavirus. This gives the impression this virus is rampant and making large numbers of people ill. </p>
<p>· The government introduces extremely draconian laws which prevents people interacting and forces vast numbers of businesses to close. </p>
<p>· The mainstream media has round the clock coverage of covid. There are endless programmes about covid. Newspapers devote page after page about covid. The Daily Mirror has figures every day for the number of deaths and cases. </p>
<p>· The government makes masks compulsory. </p>
<p>· Shops have one way systems, screens at tills to supposedly protect staff, sanitisers for hands and trolleys, customers initially had to queue to get in supermarkets, Tesco has traffic lights and limits on how many can enter a shop and signs about covid. </p>
<p>· Trains and buses have seats customers can’t use. There is an app telling you how full a train is. There are signs telling people trains are regularly disinfected. In my train station there are pieces of plastic on train benches to prevent customers sitting too close to each other. </p>
<p>· In cafes, restaurants and pubs as in shops there are screens to supposedly protect staff. Tables are set apart and there are one way systems. Track and trace is compulsory if you eat in. Pubs have to follow regulations such as table service only. </p>
<p>· There are signs everywhere telling you social distance. </p>
<p>· People are vilified as selfish disease spreaders and covid idiots when the engage in normal socialising. </p>
<p>· There are adverts in newspapers and in the street warning us about coronavirus.</p>
<p>· The governments holds daily briefings about covid. </p>
<p>· Businesses go through a cycle of having to close, being able to open and having to close again. If businesses are allowed to open, they can’t provide a full service. For instance, restaurants can provide takeaways but not sit in. </p>
<p>To justify the above, there should be clear evidence of a deadly pandemic such as people dying in large numbers, people surviving but becoming severely ill and everyone would know someone who has been ill. Staff and customers should be dropping like flies in businesses which have stayed open. If large numbers of staff dying or becoming temporarily unable to work due to illness, labour shortages would emerge and we would see issues such as food deliveries not getting through, power cuts, public transport not running. There are no actual signs we are in a pandemic. We don’t see people dying in droves or becoming ill but surviving. You don’t even see large numbers with minor symptoms such as coughing. Everyone around me is perfectly healthy. I don’t see businesses being unable to function due to staff shortages and I don’t see staff having to take time off work being an issue. On Youtube comment you hear people saying I don’t know anyone with covid. Staff and customers haven’t been dropping like flies in businesses which have stayed open all the time such as supermarkets. Without the points I mentioned above you wouldn’t notice we were in a pandemic. In a real pandemic, many of what we see would be unnecessary. For instance, in a real pandemic the government would not need to spend money on advertising if there was an obvious danger. </p>
<p>Do you feel that we are not actually in a pandemic and instead we have been subject to an intense campaign of psychological brainwashing and trickery into thinking we are in a deadly pandemic? Do you feel this manipulation and trickery has been so effective people don’t see there are no signs we are in a pandemic?</p></p>

        <p>I don’t think that COVID itself is “fake”, I believe that there is a pretty contagious yucky flu-type virus going around, but absolutely most people have been brainwashed into thinking that it will not be safe to live a “normal life” until the government says it’s safe.</p>

        <p>What you just posted has been obvious to most of us for at least 6 months if not longer, but it's well written and I'm glad you're helping to wake people up.</p>
<p>Yes, spot on. This is nonsense. Most of the "excess deaths" are related to a population boom that happened worldwide starting in 1946. It lasted 20 years.</p>
<p>A big boom. In USA alone, births went from 1.4 million to 2.7 million and it continued on like that. With more people, you have more deaths.</p>
<p>1946 was 75 years ago...</p>

        <p>I am glade to see not everyone has been brainwashed. To those that are brainwashed, if you try to talk to them about the scamdemic, they first say "I don't want to discuss it" then if you bring it up they forcefully and loudly say" STOP! , then they say they are leaving to prevent any more discussion. It is amazing, they all respond the same way like it is embedded in the brainwashing. Sounds crazy right? I dare you, try it and see the response you get.</p>

        <p>I agree with so many of your points. I've had summer colds way worse than covid. There was no coughing involved and the symptoms lasted less than 48 hours. It has been blown way tf out of proportion. I have family who watch the daily death tolls and they're just scared to death. But the only people they know who have supposedly died from it were a few people that were elderly and already not doing well. I've had some friends get it and it wasn't even worse than a flu. And my friends are all 35-65.</p>

        <p>A coworker's friend had it very bad, but stayed out of the hospital. They turned around and got the vaccine several months later and felt almost as bad as if they had covid again.  I asked my (medical professional) coworker why in the WORLD would he get a vaccine after having covid? She said "well, we don't know how long immunity is". I couldn't believe it. She had a bad reaction to the vaccine as well and that's what started the conversation.</p>

        <p>The virus is real. And it's barely more dangerous to the general population than regular flu. This is a take over from the private sector to the government. That is what 'essential business' means. War requisitioning in peace time. And they do have the resources and they build up fast.</p>
