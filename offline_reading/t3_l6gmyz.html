        <p>You need to look at the hospital protocol with regards to masks to understand the whole mask/no mask picture.  The N95 mask needs to be worn and fitted for hospital workers. Once the mask is put on when entering the hospital, you cannot touch it with your hands ever. If you do you are supposed to get  new mask.  So if you wear a mask in public, touch a keypad at the local store and touch the mask with your hands, you potentially make the mask a transmitter as you breath out.   This is how masks become ineffective. So if you watch people's behavior in public and can observe that this is not occurring, then we're good.  Otherwise, the whole mask wearing is a farce and is nothing more than command and control and what Government can force an individual to do which bleeds over to people actually being shot for not wearing a mask by the ardent mask wearer.  This is how fucked up society has become. Read Anthony Fauci's 2018 paper on masks and the 1918 Spanish  flu  pandemic.   It may open your eyes.</p>

        <p>Do some research instead of attacking others. Learn to have a conversation with a fellow human being. Ask those who have actually used masks their entire lives in professional settings how they work, how to properly fit them and what type of masks to use. If you want to "save lives" why are you not wearing a hazmat suit with an SCBA? It's ok to be wrong.</p>
<p>PS - I am at high risk for infection, have been properly trained in PPE for 23 years and I take precautions to protect myself. The stuff I see and hear on the daily is comically inaccurate</p>

        <p>&rt;Ban me from this sub already</p>
<p>Message mods instead of making a post about it.</p>
<p>&rt;Keep circle jerking eachother</p>
<p>That's essentially what subreddits are. At least here there are regularly trolls such as yourself to offer differing opinions, and essentially the entire rest of Reddit is pro-mask, pro-lockdown, etc. So as far as circlejerks go, it's not so bad here. Ever been to other subs?</p>
<p>&rt;on your trip to the grocery store maybe you won't infect that 67 year old lady</p>
<p>This is framed as if I for sure have the virus and don't know it, I will for sure infect her, and she will for sure die. One of those things happening is unlikely, all three together are stupidly unlikely. And clearly she also isn't too afraid if she's good with going into a likely crowded store. </p>
<p>&rt;It's absolutely baffling how much you people lack of empathy</p>
<p>I'm very empathetic. I haven't been too harmed by all this, but I truly care about all of the spiking unemployment, job loss, home loss, poverty, starvation, terrible education, obesity, missed health screenings, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, and suicide - all as a direct result of the "cure" for this weak as fuck virus.</p>
<p>&rt;or common sense.</p>
<p>"You disagree with me, so you clearly have no common sense."</p>
<p>&rt;There is no way government will use this kind of event to control or subdue people.</p>
<p>Uhhhhhhh, debatable.</p>
<p>&rt;you will be remembered in history as the Karens and Kens</p>
<p>Coulda sworn a "Karen" was someone who's entitled and bitchy, that insists on speaking with your manager. Kinda like what this post is all about. But whatever. People here just want to live their lives. Nothing entitled or bitchy about it.</p>
<p>&rt;with bad cardio and a huge ego</p>
<p>I find it funny trying to insult others with "you have bad cardio" whilst we're in the middle of a "literal global pandemic" where you're seen as a selfish asshole if you so much as step outside to exercise or go to the gym.</p>
<p>As far as huge egos, that could certainly be said about all the people who insist you be as terrified and paranoid as they are, demanding everything shut down.</p>
<p>&rt;it could all have been simply prevented if you listened and trusted cience</p>
<p>What exactly could be prevented if we followed the ever-changing and highly inconsistent science?</p>

        <p>How prevalent is asymptomatic transmission and does it justify being a dick to everyone who isn't wearing a mask?</p>
<p>Also, the government tends to be hesitant, to say the least, about giving up newfound authority after states of emergency. That's why the PATRIOT Act is still a thing 19 fucking years after 9/11. You'll have to excuse me if I don't trust your holy unicorns in the government.</p>

        <p>Well I can direct you to James Perloff's "Covid-19 &amp; The Agendas To Come" and he has over 300 endnotes, sources from virologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, pathologists, microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, including Nobel Prize winners, as well as front-line ER physicians, family practice MDs, etc. </p>
<p>And that's just Perloff alone. If you really wanna get into it, dig into Dr. Vernon Coleman's books, he's spent decades on this stuff, thousands of sources for you. Watch Spiro Skouras' channel, listen to the Richie Allen radio show, it's on every day from the UK. Every single weekday, he has different people in the medical field and public health/policy, he's had multiple signers of the Great Barrington Declaration, countless people all backing up the dissenting evidence.</p>
<p>Ya see my man, these aren't my "statements". They're not my "beliefs", they're where the evidence will lead you if you're not beholden to the mainstream narrative, dogmatically clinging like a fundamentalist to the orthodoxy and what the secular saints like Gates and Fauci tell you. But you won't read this, will you? You don't really care to know the truth, do you? Because more than being truthful, more than being honest, you just wanna be right. You and your ilk, you wanna be right so bad and you're so into it, you're at the sunk-cost fallacy stage. You got your ego all wrapped up in it.</p>
<p>I don't wanna be right. I wanna be truthful, I want to be honest. I want to go where the evidence leads me. In fact, I'd love it if you could prove me wrong, but you can't. And it eats you up inside, doesn't it?</p>
<p>I'd love to see your face right now. Take a picture and send it to me. Show me your surprised face. Imagine your shock.</p>

<p>I have one bit of advice for everyone on this sub.  I appreciate that the mods do not ban, that all opinions are welcome.  But here is wisdom for those who will hear:</p>
<p><strong>Don't feed the trolls.</strong></p>

        <p>Folks, I am going take one for the team; I am going to read and analyze this horror story of a submission so that you don't have to!</p>
<p>&rt;Keep circle jerking eachother until the false feeling of comfort kills hundreds if not thousands more people.</p>
<p>What he means here is that I have no coherent argument because all of my talking points are from CNN, the crappy, er, I meant trust news!</p>
<p>&rt;Masks and safety protocols are made  to mitigate the effects of the virus, blah. . . . .blah. . . . blah. . . .blah. . . .  you won't  infect that 67 year old lady that still has quite a few years to live  and potentially impair her for life, if not killing her.</p>
<p>Some where here he's talking about grand ma, and how the old lady is in good health, and as long as you don't run her over with a reindeer, she's gonna live a long life!</p>
<p>&rt;It's absolutely baffling how much you  people lack of empathy or common sense. . . blah, blah, and blah blah, blah, . . . . . .blah, blah. . . .with meaningless bullshit instead of facing real world problems.</p>
<p>The OP here has some good points! It is truly baffling how we don't bullshit each other on this sub-reddit. Hmm, may be that's because we think for ourselves? Hmm, truly mind boggling indeed!</p>
<p>&rt;Your completely insane conspiracy theories don't even make sense. It's  been tested and proven that masks don't cut airflow. It's completely  blah...blah...blah.....blah.. . .blah. . . .because they thought  that they were so "woke".</p>
<p>The OP here claims we're conspiracy theorists. G-d damn it, I've been found out! Now I am going to have to hide all them tin foil hats I've been making for the gang here. We're so delusional, who knows, may be we'll need a rt-PCR test to verify if we conspiracy theory content in our DNA. We might have to even do anal swabs!</p>
<p>&rt;Start making sense for once in your life. You are making life harder for those who put themselves on the line to keep <strong>you</strong>  safe. Blah. . . ..blah. . . .blah. . . .blah . . . .blah. . . .blah. . . .the same way you read a random post on facebook and  instantly find it credible.</p>
<p>I get the feeling here the OP is trying to make some incoherent plea to our conspiratorial senses, and look up more of them folks in "warzones" who are clearly "exhausted, tired and are one the brink" from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6eRZv-FGdsc_WkURXquAOkBXZkmOeQEj">all that dancing when they're supposed to be caring for patients</a>!</p>
<p>I think the take away from this post is clear, kids, don't do drugs while on reddit!</p>
