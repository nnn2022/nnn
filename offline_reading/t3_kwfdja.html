    <strong>The way people started accepting masks as gospel is insane.</strong>
    <p><p>The funny thing is, in the following weeks after shit went down way back in March, I didn't see a single person wearing a face masks in the store. Nor did I hear or see any discussion about it on social media.</p>
<p>The way people just accepted masks as the ultimate "gospel" overnight (all because the government told them to wear a mask) is pretty insane. Not to mention the way people immediately became pro mask as if they had been secretly advocating it the entire time.</p>
<p>I bet you if the government had done an experiment and never ever told the general public to wear a mask, most people wouldn't even consider wearing one or having those ridiculous political debates. People are a bunch of brainless sheep who will do whatever the government tells them to do without a second thought.</p></p>

        <p>People are afraid of this virus.  They shouldn't be - but they are.  They see scary death statistics from the MSM that aren't presented in context and it freaks them the fuck out.</p>
<p>Combine that with a message of "do this one, very visible, relatively easy thing and you'll be safe" and you can see where the religious zealotry comes from.</p>
<p>I firmly believe Fauci and other government officials understand  the true efficacy of masks (hint: not very), yet they continue to push the mask narrative <em>purely</em> as a means of trying to keep people from freaking out.</p>

        <p>This represents a failure of leadership at every level. Treating your constituents like children who need to be told Santa is real instead of informing them properly like adults. So now they hold "The Old Normal" hostage like a parent who says if we eat all our veggies, then we can have dessert.</p>

        <p>Any explanation has to take into account the phenomenon of mask-wearing in so many different countries, not only in the USA.</p>
<p>I don't think people wear them because they are scared. People wear them because they it is expected, and human beings are creatures with a built-in sense of social responsibility. Some are more conformist than others, and some will demand to be convinced, but very few people are out there saying "Yeah I think the masks are effective but fuck you I don't want to wear one." Generally speaking people just don't want to rock the apple cart. Especially when it now comes with all the additional baggage of people thinking that you're some kind of (gasp) <em>heretic!</em></p>
<p>&rt;"do this one, very visible, relatively easy thing and you'll be safe"</p>
<p>I have yet to see anyone actually saying this. It is, or should be, widely known that <em>if the masks do anything,</em> they prevent the mask-wearer from spreading the virus. Again, if they even do this. Or if asymptomatic transmission is even a serious concern.</p>
<p>Depressingly I think the truth is much more banal. There has never been any really good reason to believe that widespread masking actually does anything - there has been some evidence that would support that theory, but nothing that ought to seriously discredit years of consensus - but they are demanded anyway because they <em>might</em> have some effect, and governments are terrified of being seen as not doing enough.</p>

        <p>People wear them because they are terrified and the mask makes them feel safe! Not because they are expected. My mask is made from a piece of mesh. No one says a word about it but when I wore a surgical mask and left my nose exposed, I got yelled at several times!</p>

        <p>Most people are not terrified. Where I live, masks are mandated in any indoor public space, but it's rare to see anybody wearing one outdoors. The people who are hyper-demanding of conformity are most definitely a vocal minority. Ask the people who actually have to wear a mask all day at work, most will tell you that they wouldn't be wearing one if they didn't have to.</p>

        <p>Where I’m at, most people are scared and wear masks while driving alone in their cars and pulling weeds in their front yard. It’s rare to see people outside without a mask on here. It’s because they are scared and have drunk the kool-aid.</p>

        <p>These people love to act like wearing masks was their idea and the media hasn't influenced them at all. At the beginning of this, I was taking way more precaution than anyone else. I knew if this this was real, there's no possible way it will stay in China for how contagious they said it was. I was the only one wearing a mask in public and this loud mouth lady talking to the cashier said "and you know, masks really don't do anything. Dr Fauci said they do more harm than good." She was basically saying it loud so I'd hear, because I had a mask on. I bet the bitch is falling in line now.  And I'm being harassed for TRYING not to wear one, cause I know know this was all bullshit with an agenda behind it.</p>

        <p>This drives me INSANE! I acted the exact same way; I already had an N95 for home projects which I wore outside the house, I carry hand sanitizer and wash my hands very frequently (upwards of 10+ times a day, I know, it's a compulsion). I wear and change nitrile gloves frequently because it's a habit I got into as an undergrad. </p>

        <p>I managed to get some n95s before the really big rush started. I had hair coverings, shoe covers, gloves, goggles. I bought an ozone generator. I was all in. I was telling everyone, "you'll see". Now, my opinion has evolved. Yes the REACTION is there from the government, but not 80% of everyone dying around you type of thing.</p>

        <p>Not just masks, but how people (my partner included) just follow government orders, are immune to any information that disagree's, including their own eyes.</p>
<p>My partner is getting upset that I'm not following restrictions, we had an argument.</p>
<p>She agree'd that the government's incompetent, and no one (including them) know what they're doing.</p>
<p>And she's going to continue listening to them after saying this.</p>
<p>She's struggling with the restrictions as well, they're making her depressed and anxious, but refuses to entertain the idea that they might be bullshit and ignored.</p>
<p>The AMAZING thing is she actually breaks the rules herself, and doesn't think anything of it when she does.</p>

<p>My boyfriend says the same, but he claims he's following doctors and "the science". And yes, he also broke the rules, but now proclaims "he's not being careless anymore" and "we're not taking any chances". It's like a broken record.</p>

        <p>I'm so sick of hearing maskers quote "science", when it's really just an appeal to authority fallacy on their part. The real truth is the mask is something you "wear to show you care", and most people don't want to appear uncaring. It's a silly social virtue signal cycle that I refuse to take part in.</p>

        <p>What absolutely slays me is that the same people who will tell you "The government is corrupt", "You can't trust politicians", or "The government is wasting my tax dollars" will swear up and down that the mask mandates are in our best interests and necessary - despite all the evidence to the contrary/</p>
<p>How can the skepticism about every other aspect of political life not carry over into the "War on Corona"? How can these people be so blind?</p>

        <p>I honestly think we are living in some type of horror sci-fi movie like invasion of the body snatchers or the happening.....something is in the air. Whether it's aliens, hell taking over....idk but the fact that so many people who are literally losing money over this corona shit and possibly everything are still this bought into blows my mind.</p>
<p>I for sure thought that once this corona virus shit started affecting people's wallets than you would see a 180 real fucking fast but if anything, the exact opposite has happened. Either the power to come off as self righteous hero fuck for wearing a mask and losing everything is stronger than their need for more money or they are posessed by aliens or something. I have no fucking clue.</p>

        <p>This whole "pandemic" has made me realize how much people love being dominated by their government or really anyone with power over them. Vast majority of humans really were just meant to be herded like dumb animals because that's all most are anyway. It's just unfortunate that it seems only evil pyschos have the desire to herd so you just get history repeating itself with the same shit.</p>

        <p>Especially the younger generation.  They've been coddled by snowplow parents and never had to face reality of having to solve their own problems.  They just appeal to an authority figure and whine about it until they do something and are quite happy to live that way not having to ever think for themselves.</p>

The other day someone said I can't have my penis out at the DMV -- of course the government would try to control my body like that.

        <p>Where i live here mask mandate only come in on jan 2, before that it was optional. When it was optional maybe 20% of people were doing it, the very next day after it was 99%  and has been since.
people are fucking pathetic and i feel nothing but shame for the way my country has collapsed to this pathetic agenda, the people deserve what they get it is just unfortunate that the rest of us are going to suffer because of it.</p>

        <p>It can't be explained by merely pointing at the US government, because this happened in other countries as well. The actual narrative is "there wasn't enough medical evidence to justify telling everyone to wear a mask, and now there is." This change on its own isn't suspicious. What's suspicious is that they won't acknowledge how unsure they really are about it all. They have decided to behave as though masks work, because if they do, it will have been worth it, and if they don't, in their minds, nothing will have been lost (except public confidence in scientists but they don't realize this).</p>

        <p>This annoys the hell out of me.  If we'd built factories and ramped up production of PPE that <em>actually protects the wearer</em>, we wouldn't be stuck dealing with this "you're responsible for everyone else's health" BS.  Those who chose to could wear the PPE to protect themselves, and the rest of us could move on with our lives.  Also, y'know, a fitted N95 mask might actually do something for the vulnerable.  And ramping up production would create much-needed jobs.</p>

        <p>Here in England the crazy thing is that masks only became mandatory in shops and public transport in July. I have seen barely anyone wearing them before then. So even thought we were in a GlObaL pAnDeMiC so severe we had to lockdown the country, before July it was absolutely fine to not wear a mask but from July if you don't do it you are a literal murderer.</p>
<p>And all the mask stasis claim to be in the tiny minority who wore masks before July. How convenient.</p>

        <p>I wore a mask to the grocery store before the government told me to because it seemed logical, it seemed to help in other countries where mask-wearing is normal, I didn't trust the advice that we shouldn't wear masks, and I already owned masks for home improvement projects.  I had to get over the feeling that people would judge me negatively because it was so engrained in our society that only people from other parts of the world wear masks.  I do agree that some people trust masks too much.</p>

<p>There is a loooot of conflicting science, you need to do your own research and not take the word of the government or these scientists you’ve never checked into. Seriously it can seem scary and like a lot of work but if you don’t start thinking for yourself and questioning your reality you’re in for a shit life, and you won’t even realize it til it’s way too late</p>

        <p>I didn't want to wear a mask at first. But it was either that or be fired. So. I kept it on. I can't go to a store without one bc... mandatory so I wear one. Can't really do much else. But to accept it. What're you going to do. Complain you don't want to wear one and be denied service? Man I would rather just fucking wear it and move on. It's stupid.</p>

        <p>You’re missing the point. There is no conclusive evidence that masks work. If they did, we wouldn’t have disclaimers on the box/package clearly saying that this mask cannot prevent the spread of Covid or any other infectious disease.</p>

        <p>That may be true. But at the same time the status quo is wear a mask or be denied service, fired or whatever other repercussion there are to not wearing one..my point was to merely highlight that sometimes we need to do shit we don't particularly like.</p>

        <p>The whole point of this sub is to reject the new normal, or new status quo, so to speak. We want to go back to the old normal, which in this context means no mask requirements. The fearmongering we’ve seen about this pandemic is vastly overblown.</p>
