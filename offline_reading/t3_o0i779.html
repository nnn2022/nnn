    <strong>Looking for feedback on an vaccine post</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I'm planning to make a public post on social media about vaccines. My aim is to get people thinking critical about the topic. My target audience is people who are planning to or considering to get the vaccine, so I'm taking a very tempered approach, something that even a Covidian could agree with. So think like a Doomer - how would you attack this post? Are there any inaccuracies?</p>
<h1>I'm not getting the COVID vaccine‚Ä¶ right now</h1>
<p>There is this narrative that the vaccines are 100% safe &amp; every reasonable person would obviously get it. And if you don't get vaccinated you're a stupid anti-vax science-denier. That narrative is dangerously deceptive and wrong. Many people like myself aren't anti-vax - there are simply issues with the COVID vaccines that will make any reasonable person realize that it's not such an obvious decision. </p>
<h2>It's safe</h2>
<p>It's important to know that compared to well-understood vaccines like Polio the COVID vaccines are still early-stage vaccines. The COVID vaccines didn't go through the rigorous testing that other existing vaccines went through - it was granted temporary emergency authorization.
I'm especially concerned about the mRNA vaccines (e.g. Pfizer): They've been working on mRNA technology for over 3 decades and haven't produced a single mRNA product that passed the trial stages and was released to market... And now they made an mRNA vaccine and are just skipping the trials?</p>
<p>Common sense tells me the vaccine can't be completely safe: Over the last 50 years, trial periods have become longer and longer because we realized we can't predict how the body reacts to new medication. Nobody knows what the long-term effects will be. Maybe nothing. Maybe increased cancer risk or infertility. We don't know because they haven't completed long-term studies. Not to mention the immediate adverse reactions and deaths that are being reported right now already: There were roughly as many vaccine-related deaths reported to the CDC in 2021 as in the last 30 years (1990-2020).</p>
<p>So either one of two things is true:  </p>
<p>The continuous scientific progress over the last 50 years was all wrong and we can invent, produce &amp; test completely new medical experiments in less than 12 months without the need for long-term studies. And all of the reported adverse reactions are part of a huge anti-vax conspiracy.</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>During this worldwide state of fear pharma companies are avoiding proper scientific processes to quickly release their product without appropriate tests.</p>
<p>I have more trust in the tried &amp; tested scientific process that emerged over multiple decades than a few politicians, pharma executives, and specifically selected experts during a crisis. </p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Of course, nothing in life is free of risk. So what are the benefits of the vaccine? 
Vaccinated people still get COVID, they still spread COVID, they still die from COVID. The pharma companies talk about 70% protection through the vaccine but that's insanely misleading. That's relative risk. The absolute protection is around &lt;1%:
In the UK we currently have around 240k active cases. That's 0.4% of the population. So currently the chances of testing positive for COVID is 0.4%. If the vaccine gives you a 70% relative protection that means that in absolute terms your only 70% of 0.4% = <em>0.28%</em> less like to test positive than before the vaccine! You previously had a 0.4% chance of testing positive, now 0.12%. </p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>vaccine manufacturers have been absolved of any liability caused by the vaccine (unless they made a defective dose). If you end up having any side effects you're just out of luck. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-pfizer-vaccine-legal-indemnity-safety-ministers-b1765124.html">They can't be held accountable.</a>
Imagine a car company told you </p>
<p>&rt; "Oh by the way, if the breaks fail or the car explodes while you drive we can't be held accountable. But don't worry it's safe üòâ"</p>
<p>I carry all the risk while the pharma companies stand to gain huge profits. Vaccine manufacturers have every incentive to rush their product to market by whatever means necessary... And Pfizer has an atrocious track record:</p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2875889/">Pfizer has been a ‚Äúhabitual offender,‚Äù persistently engaging in illegal and corrupt marketing practices, bribing physicians and suppressing adverse trial results. Since 2002 the company and its subsidiaries have been assessed $3 billion in criminal convictions, civil penalties and jury awards.</a></p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Get the vaccine or don't. Everyone needs to make their own risk assessment. I've seen enough red flags and too little benefit to justify getting it right now when the long-term effects are still unknown.<br>
And any effort to coerce me into getting it through political pressure (like vaccine passports) is morally reprehensible and against the Nuremberg Code.<br>
If you want me to take the vaccine finish your long-term studies. Proof scientifically that it's safe. Take legal responsibility in case it isn't. Don't use politics to force me into it.</p></p>

        <p>You can't get people thinking critically about this experimental procedure they call a vaccine.  Their minds are made up.  If they had the ability to think critically, they would be questioning EVERYTHING for the past year and a bit... but they don't.  Sheep don't question, sheep obey.</p>

        <p>I already stopped 3 people from getting it. 2 of them were about to book their appointment on the day I talked with them and they ended up not doing it.</p>
<p>That's why I don't question the masks, the lockdowns, tests, etc in my post. It's not too late to say no to the vaccine even if you believe in the rest.</p>

        <p>One thing that jumped out at me from a devil‚Äôs advocate perspective, is that regarding its safety, it is claimed by the CDC and FDA that the covid vaccines <em>have</em> passed ‚Äúrigorous safety trials‚Äù. Doomers quote this all the time. There was a successful animal study and a human study before they got EUA. I think if you want to criticize the safety, you‚Äôll need to criticize these studies (off the top of my head: the animal trials only followed the animals for 28 days, and the human trials were selective with volunteers‚Äînot a random sample of the population). </p>
<p>I also advise adding reliable sources for everything you‚Äôre arguing with. Proving that actual science backs us up and we‚Äôre not actually using mommy blogs to educate ourselves, will be far more convincing to a doomer. </p>
<p>I recommend checking out the content from this organization...I‚Äôve been following them for years and they always cite actual peer-reviewed medical journals regarding vaccines. Here‚Äôs their professional breakdown of covid vaccines, using the vaccine‚Äôs own trial data‚Äîvery informative stuff: https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/covid-19-vaccines/</p>

        <p>One thing along these lines that /u/ThisOrThatOrTheOther should consider:  1/3 of drugs developed between 2001 and 2010 had a recall due to safety concerns that were not caught during clinical trials.  And the median time to find these was over 4 years.  One of the biggest causes for this was accelerating the approval process.  Guess what we have now?  In other words, despite well intentions of the FDA to approve these tings, a significant percent of issues fall through the cracks and we may not know for years.</p>

<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/09/527575055/one-third-of-new-drugs-had-safety-problems-after-fda-approval</p>
<p>I would also look up Dr. Robert Malone, one of the fathers of mRNA technology.  He's been critical of the whole process so far and even wants proper investigation of alternatives like Ivermectin.</p>

        <p>Very good points as well. There‚Äôs definitely a lot of hard-hitting considerations in regards to safety. I feel these points are more important to make, because claiming they skipped trials isn‚Äôt entirely accurate (even if the trials they <em>did</em> perform were poorly done) and will make a doomer write off everything else, because they haven‚Äôt looked at the trials themselves.</p>

<p>You could come up with the best designed clinical trials and still not get everything 100% right.  Mostly because it's not feasible to inject your drug into 100million people and then track them for 15 years.</p>

        <p>You are trying to inform people which is commendable. But from their perspective, you're spreading dangerous misinformation that will get people literally killed.
So my advise would be to re-structure the perspective. You might want to start with the dangers of the Coof. Cite some sources, give an example of someone who had a hard time. Then you might want to quote a doctor or two who advises in behaving responsibly, working out getting those nutrients etc.
Then I'd disprove general disbelief in vaccines and provide examples for that.
Now that you have grabbed the attention of the reader and made sure those defense mechanisms eased up, you might want to inform about the different risk factors (obesity, vitamins c and d, zinc etc.) and provide evidence from those south east Asian studies that looked into who actually dies.
Now's as good a time as a any to really hammer home the point that relative risk reduction is a nonsense metric all by itself.
I'd not provide numbers, but tell them to check trusted sources with the specific terminology one needs to know to get sound info.
After all that, keep the outlines you drew and copy paste your post.
Be prepared for people calling you all sorts of names, others defaming and lying about you.
Those are just some suggestions, I wish you the best of luck.</p>

        <p>it's not bad. I made a post using the text from 2 CNN articles on why taking a rushed vaccine is bad. There might be some stuff in there you can use.</p>
<p>Explain the Nuremberg code and how this is against it. IIRC the code has no legal weight although was a source for others.</p>
<p>I liked your section on risk, but I would simplify it even more. </p>
<p>If you can add some links to credible sources. If they are selling crystals, gold or long term food storage on their website then they might not be credible.</p>
