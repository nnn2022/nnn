    <strong>Another Canadian airport falls to the masks.</strong>
    <p><p>YVR (Vancouver) airport just issued a new mask ‘requirement’. I flew a couple weeks ago and while masks were required at security &amp; on the plane, the rest of the airport felt relatively normal and no staff were wearing masks outside of food service. Looks like that has changed, though I’m still not certain if there’s actually a requirement; while the page title says “requirements”, the actual bullet point says “asking that face coverings be worn”:</p>
<p>https://www.yvr.ca/en/updates/takecare</p>
<p>This is likely because YYZ (Toronto) required masks as of June 1. When no one immediately followed suit I had some hope, but then YYC (Calgary) caved this week and now YVR. </p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is the airports want people to fly and they think this will make people feel safe, so they are requiring it. But it’s all bullshit security theater, which I think will actually make people feel less safe/comfortable flying. If people DO feel more comfortable, we have truly catered to the lowest common denominator, and are actually starting to live in a dystopia. </p>
<p>What’s driving me extra crazy is, according to actual real-life studies (rather than models), not only are masks not proven to work - there’s also the concern that wearing one can actually make you sick, as you touch your face more often with a mask on, and also the mask traps microbes/germs in a nice, 37 degree environment, perfect for reproducing, right against your face! </p>
<p>I’m flying in a couple weeks again, and I won’t wear it since the phrase is ‘asking’. If someone pushes me I’ll ask if it’s actually legally mandated within the airport, as the wording is unclear. But if I want to see family, I’ll have to put it on if the other option is being banned from the airport. Absolutely fucking totalitarian. Ridiculous.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. Due to the wording, it doesn’t sound like it’ll be strictly enforced. </p>
<p>If you do end up being forced to wear one, though, taking long drinks of water (or even just holding a bottle up to your mouth) or slooowly eating a snack like pretzels or crackers is a nice way to get around the worst of it. You can also pull it below your nose, which makes breathing much easier.</p>

        <p>It will be enforced... Airports in Canada are primarily owned by the government and they aren't motivated by positive cash flow, if they have to bleed money for a few quarters in a row due to massive drop in flying, doesn't matter in there eyes. Getting the agenda across is more important, Trudeau is all in with this lockdown hoax. Pretty sure at this point he takes recommendations straight from the WHO and UN on how to deal with this " crisis ".</p>
<p>He wants that UN seat when he retires.</p>
