    <strong>Does anybody else think the numbers being used for “people vaccinated” are suspicious? 70%???</strong>
    <p><p>Nearly everything I see being reported is that 70% (or close to it) of people in _____ group are already vaccinated. 70% In this city, 70% of workers in this hospital, etc. I’ve seen other people on here say that they’re skeptical that that many people are actually vaccinated. It’s starting to seem like a convenient number to me. It’s high enough that it makes the unvaccinated feel outnumbered but not like they’re claiming something ridiculous 95% which we would all agree is not true. I feel like they’re making every last ditch effort to make the unvaccinated feel pressured and cave. I don’t even believe numbers anymore after learning PCR tests are inaccurate. Anybody else find it all suspicious??</p></p>

        <p>he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connection with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at one-hundred-and-forty-five million pairs. The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than one-hundred-and-forty-five millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain.</p>

        <p>The lying is probably worse than any aspect of the situation itself. My first thought when I heard about covid was it was going to be the typical big thing that turned into nothing and we'd all be like, see, it was nothing and you made us buy all that water and toilet paper.</p>
<p>But at some point they'd gone too far. Businesses were folding, people were dying and not just from covid, schoolkids were failing. Kind of like the UFO coverups, if you will. How can they admit they've been lying for 70 years? How can they admit covid wasn't as bad as they said? How can they admit the vaccine isn't our salvation?</p>
<p>We've basically served a year and a half sentence. Why does prison suck so much? Not just because you lose your freedom, not just because you're bored or you're among scary people or the food is terrible. It's the time you lost that you'll never get back. Losing the best years of your life. </p>
<p>At least prisoners know when their sentence ends.</p>

        <p>I don't think that's necessarily what he's implying; rather, the issue has likely been co-opted for use as justification for more wealth redistribution, infringement on civil liberties, etc. Just like there is a virus, but the response has been completely irrational</p>

        <p>I for sure think the figures have been cooked. Of course they would be, look at the whole mega-tsunami of other lies and deceit, the coercion. It's pretty clear they are raging war on us.</p>
<p>This is 100% about making people who don't want the vaccine feel isolated. Of course the figures have been ramped up. To what degree is anyone's guess.</p>

        <p>It’s total BS. That’s why they are pushing the vaxx so hard. The numbers have never added up when it comes to Covid. And numbers are concrete. They don’t lie. Unless it’s Covid.</p>

        <p>GLOBALLY, the percent vaccinated (with at least 1 or both doses) as of late July 2021 is <strong>less than 30%</strong>. And less than half of that, for fully vaccinated. According to the Council of Foreign Relations. https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/covid-19-vaccination-challenge-lessons-history  </p>
<p>&rt;just 14 percent of the world’s population is fully vaccinated against the disease and less than 30 percent has received at least one dose. In Africa, the share of fully vaccinated is dramatically lower, at under 2 percent.</p>

        <p>Numbers could be upped due to maxxie-vaxxie cult. https://www.businessinsider.com/mulit-vaxxers-unauthorized-booster-shots-delta-variant-2021-8?utm_source=reddit.com</p>
<p>Some hospitals even gave green light for immunocompromised to receive their 3rd shot: https://abc7news.com/coronavirus-sf-general-hospital-supplemental-vaccine-jj-shot/10926455/</p>
<p>Fact is there is rise in demand for booster shots due this 'delta variant game changer', you can even see some online that are desperate enough to concoct illegal ways to get their next fix: https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/search?q=booster&amp;restrict_sr=on

<p>They say in Israel triple vaxxers already makeup 5% of population; in USA they do not pick that number yet, I think they add it to existing percentage... Those are my two cents. </p>
<p>I don't buy 70% either, if you're unvaccinated at this point of time, you're are petty adamant on not taking it under any type of circumstances, greek alphabet won't sway you.</p>

        <p>I gotta say, I am floored by the number of people I've learned got the shot. Floored. I expected it to be about the same number of people who get the annual flu shot, which I don't typically track but I've always assumed was low. Even my like-minded friends have gotten it <em>to travel.</em></p>
<p>I want to travel, too! But honestly, the fun of traveling is GONE anyway. I went to coastal Maine twice during the scamdemic to visit family, just got back in May. I bet I would have a rougher time now that vax insanity has set in, not to mention I keep hearing about flight cancellations becoming routine. </p>
<p>I don't trust many numbers at all. It will take a long time before they earn back our trust.</p>

        <p>I think 70% while maybe a little above what is true, isn't even close to the most egregious thing they are claiming.  I would estimate that 60 - 70 % of people have the vaccine.  They just probably use the higher end of the estimate to suit them.  If it suited them to use the lower end, they would.</p>

        <p>Agreed this seems reasonable. Still, again, more lies, no matter to what degree at this stage. Lies, manipulation, bullying and coercion are what they are at the end of the day. It's an outright form of aggression.</p>
<p>We are dealing with a globally orchestrated force that means us no good, that much is very clear.</p>
