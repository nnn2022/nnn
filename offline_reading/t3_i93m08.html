    <strong>Feels like I'm losing it</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday down by the beach I saw a sign with a casket it on it that read "Mask it or Casket!" In my county of ~250,000 people, in the last 6 months, 6 have died while testing positive. 6 people. All of them 65+ with multiple pre-existing conditions. How do you hang that sign and feel like what you're doing makes sense? How do you look at the numbers and think any of this makes sense?</p>
<p>Our acute care, ICU, and ventilator censuses are all completely nominal and haven't moved from their baseline in months. Positive tests spiked but in conjunction with increased testing. Granted, in late July the actual positive test rate briefly spiked above 10%. We've never had more than 20 people hospitalized at one time in the county. Currently there are 13.</p>
<p>Restaurants are closed to indoor service. Movie theaters, bars and gyms are closed. No in-person school attendance this fall. Masks to be worn everywhere in public under threat of fine unless exercising outdoors.</p>
<p>If you point any of this out to people they say things like "Well without the lockdowns and masks the numbers would be worse!" Really? How do you know? Then it's a flow of low-effort regurgitated propaganda from NYT or Wapo. You can't refute it because that's the primary source of information for most people around here. It's scripture to them. It doesn't matter what they can see with their eyes. It's reinforced by Twitter and Facebook. Everyone sharing the same garbage with zero critical thinking. The best response I can get from anyone is an occasional "Well I don't know what to think anymore so I'm not doing anything." I think it's because I'm in a predominantly liberal town with almost entirely liberal friends and that side of the media is pushing this the hardest. I'm not a conservative but I feel like I need to get away from here. It's like living in a lunatic asylum. It would mean ending nearly all of my close friends and relationships. I thought this would all blow over and I'm still hopeful it does after the election but then what's next? I feel like the last 4 years have been non-stop crazy town.</p>
<p>Anyway sorry for the rant. Just need to vent. Like the title says I feel like I'm losing it.</p></p>

        <p>Just off the phone with my new realtor on the other side of the country. I made a joke about "The New Normal" and she policed me up. "No. I am not doing that New Normal stuff." Basically sealed the deal for me. </p>

        <p>I'm a weather wimp so leaving coastal California would be difficult. Not sure where I'd go but I think it'd have to be to one of the states that never instituted a lockdown. I guess Utah would be highest up on that list for me personally.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, man. I feel you, and I honestly don't know what it's going to take to get people to drop their fear. I really don't. I've seen many people even sacrifice their businesses, and jobs, and even homes out of fear of this virus. It's completely insane, yet people aside from those who frequent this sub, are seen as the ones who are insane right now.</p>

        <p>I think it will be a combination of: the media slowly running out of fear mongering stories and people realising the economic fallout from this is serious, very serious, and will probably lead to many more deaths (of a lower average age) than the virus.</p>

We cant keep quiet now. I get alot of backlash for the things I post regarding lockdowns on my personal social media but I know I'm at least getting some people to think a little harder. If we accept this shit it will happen we have to revolt.</p>

<p>I've seen a lot of people on our side endorse Biden, claiming that he will make everything go away. I don't believe that, at all. The man's stated he would make masks a national mandate. Would. As in, he likely will if he is elected. Not to mention, he creepily supports other New Normal nonsense. I have my doubts he and the other Dems would make the hysteria go away.</p>

        <p>I cynically think that once the lockdowns and masks hold no political value they'll be dropped like a bad habit. If Democrats win they can just claim all of the idiocy saved the day and they were right and we should be glad they saved us and we can get back to normal now. If Republicans win and Democrats realize they can't remove Trump from office just because the economy is cratered they'll move on to something else to try to remove him from office with. Really this thought it the only thing keeping me sane right now.</p>

        <p>Either way the economy is dead for the next 5 to 10 years. They will blame the young for their mistakes. A lot of people will be jobless and homeless and Democrats won't fix the problems they created and tell us to shut up if we point it out.</p>

        <p>Yeah. The damage done to the economy is worse than I think people want to believe, even those on our side. Like, I saw people at LDS say that "thing will be back to normal, even if it's in 2025! :D" and I just shake my head at the naivete. If we continue with these measures into 2025, there will be tons more damage done, both to the economy, and people's well-being. The idea is that we need to revert our society back to normal, to prevent more widespread damage, we can't just wait five years at this rate.</p>

        <p>Some people speculate we'll get some kind of UBI. I can see that happening, but the UBI will probably be pathetic, and won't improve quality of life. If we get UBI, it'll likely be less than $1200 a month, I can guarantee that. It'll be just enough to scrape by, but you won't be able to save it or use it on recreation, only on "essentials".</p>

        <p>I think the UBI I have in mind is a product of the government printing more money until the system collapses then they'll usher in a new monetary system, and probably another UBI born of that. But that's just speculation on my part.</p>

        <p>I get how you feel. I live in LA, which is the hardest hit city/county in the state, and this place feels like some sort of dystopia. My family very much believes the narrative (they get the paper and it says pretty much the same thing as WaPo and NYT) and they think I'm some sort of lunatic whenever I say anything contrary to the narrative. This city will become a police state and everyone will be okay with it because "we're all in this together." I've never felt so hopeless.</p>

        <p>Yes I hear you, this is a monstrous challenge, not for the faint of heart! Do whatever you need to take care of yourself. It's all very surreal.  It's such a relief just to know there are others with the same concerns. The censorship on these groups and information is out of control right now, and the weight of the constant new restrictions is stifling and overwhelming.  I am so hopeful that we will be able to come together en masse and say enough is enough like Berlin &amp; Montreal have done.  If anyone is in the Hudson Valley / NYC area, send a message, no idea where to find my people! Hope you all can find some peace in the small moments at this time.</p>

        <p>I’m with you. Every time I feel like there’s good news and/or I get my hopes up, everything falls apart again. Happened today. The last few days I had been feeling more positive, then I get the news alert about Biden calling for a 3 month nationwide mask mandate for everyone even outdoors. And I know he’s not the president and has no power whatsoever, but he is the democratic nominee and of course anything he says will have some impact, if nothing else it’ll just deepen the divide even more. It’s so fucking hopeless. Get me out of this timeline please.</p>
