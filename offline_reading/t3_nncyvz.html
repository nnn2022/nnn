    <strong>COVID-19 'has NO credible natural ancestor' and WAS created by Chinese scientists</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9629563/Chinese-scientists-created-COVID-19-lab-tried-cover-tracks-new-study-claims.html</p>
<p>&rt;The study also points to 'deliberate destruction, concealment or contamination of data' in Chinese labs and notes that 'scientists who wished to share their findings haven't been able to do so or have disappeared'... </p>
<p>&rt;While analyzing COVID-19 samples last year in an attempt to create a vaccine, Dalgleish and SÃ¸rensen discovered 'unique fingerprints' in the virus that they say could only have arisen from manipulation in a laboratory... </p>
<p>&rt;One diagram of the coronavirus shows six 'fingerprints' identified by the two scientists, which they say show the virus must have been made in a lab...</p>
<p>&rt;In the 22-page paper which is set to be published in the scientific journal Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery, the scientists describe their months-long 'forensic analysis', looking back at experiments done at the Wuhan lab between 2002 and 2019... </p>
<p>&rt;One tell-tale sign of alleged manipulation the two men highlighted was a row of four amino acids they found on the SARS-Cov-2 spike...  </p>
<p>&rt;which cause the virus to tightly cling to the negatively charged parts of human cells like a magnet, and so become more infectious... </p>
<p>&rt;But because, like magnets, the positively charged amino acids repel each other, it is rare to find even three in a row in naturally occurring organisms, while four in a row  is 'extremely unlikely,'</p>

        <p>Shocked. Shocked I tell you. Equally shocked as to why the mainstream media, Reddit, and Facebook are now allowing this year old news to be told. Just kidding. I know orangemanbad was the priority.</p>

        <p>Ever since dr li-meng YAN (dunno why she capitalizes YAN but it cracks me up) argued sars-cov-2 was engineered last year I have strongly suspected this.</p>
<p>A natural species jump would have gradual changes. It wouldn't immediately skip to the perfect spike protein for infecting human cells.</p>
<p>CCP apparently arrested her mother too</p>
