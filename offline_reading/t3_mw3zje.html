    <strong>Off My Chest: rant here here because it’d be taken down from the real OffMyChest</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not “anti-vax.” In fact, I’m very much <em>pro-vax</em>. In my life I’ve had a litany of inoculations and plan on having plenty more over the course of my natural life. Believe it or not, I’m not even “anti-CV19-vax.” I just want to wait a little while before I decide if I want it—not because I think some 5G bullshit, or whatever other over-the-top caricature of a conspiracy theory people keep trying to use to put words in my mouth. I want to wait a little bit for the same reason I don’t buy the first model year of a new car, or get a new phone or game console when they first get released. There are always small things that need to be sorted out with any new technology or product. I’m not insinuating the vaccines aren’t safe, or are filled with “bugs.” I just want to be prudent with, and feel comfortable about, what I put into my body, no different than the foods I eat or the beverages I drink. I’m in the second lowest risk age group, I don’t have underlying complications or preexisting conditions. Between strength training, cardio, and yoga I’m physically active 7 days a week, I eat well, I don’t smoke, I <strong>very</strong> seldom drink, I’ve had like 2 sodas in the last decade, I spend time outside every single day. Simply put I take care of myself. Yes, I realize there have been healthy people, professional athletes, etc., who have gotten CV19 and had bad symptoms, so don’t waste your time or mine with whataboutisms. I’m not claiming “it can’t happen to me, I won’t catch it!” I’m saying at my level of health and general risk, I’d prefer to let my body fight it off, assuming it hasn’t already, because after a year of this I’ve surely come into contact with it by now. Hell, my next door neighbors both came down with pretty bad cases while I was daytime petsitting for them, so that house was definitely contaminated when I was in there. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope this vaccine works. I really, truly do. And I sincerely hope mRNA proves to be an awesome and safe medical breakthrough with a multitude of future applications. If you want to get it, great! I’m genuinely happy for you. My brother, his wife, and both of my parents have all had their first Pfizer shots without incident. My 90 year old grandmother—my only remaining grandparent who I’ve infuriatingly not been allowed to see for over a year—has received both of her Moderna shots without incident. I just want to be allowed to make my own decisions about my life and my body without being mocked or ridiculed over it; without being pressured into it over threats of being treated like a second class citizen. I don’t think Big Tech (whatever that means anymore) should be given access to my private medical information to determine whether I can buy groceries or watch live sports. Just because you agree with the precedent it sets today doesn’t mean that precedent won’t be used for something you vehemently disagree with in the future. People screamed about Trump being an authoritarian, and lord knows I disagreed with a lot of things he did, but my goodness people how do you not look at some of what’s being proposed and think “ya’ know, that sounds pretty authoritarian...” </p>
<p>I can’t believe any of what I’ve written above is considered a controversial position. Honestly, before the world lost its collective mind in 2020 I think it would be controversial to think anything <em>other than</em> what I laid out above. In all the years I’ve been on Reddit I’ve never once seen a post prior to mid-2020 that had even an inkling of a positive thing to say about “Big Pharma,”but now suddenly I’m a flat-earth nutjob for wanting to be a little cautious? Really? You don’t have to be a conspiracy person to acknowledge there have been things over the years we were assured to be initially safe only to later find out they weren’t. Surely “conspiracy theorists” aren’t the only people who have seen the legal ads about asbestos/mesothelioma, or the once-FDA-approved surgical meshes. So I’ll say it again, I truly hope this vaccine, and future mRNA applications, prove to be wonderful medical achievements. Just let me get it if and when I want. </p>
<p>I’m not an overly political person—I have deeply entrenched beliefs that fall on both sides of the spectrum, and I have never voted straight-ticket in my life. If this vaccine ends up being everything they claim it is, then I think both the Trump administration <strong>and</strong> Biden administration deserve recognition for their efforts in making it happen. If you want to assume I’m a tRuMpTaRd or whatever other broad brush is chosen to paint people with whom you don’t agree 100%, that’s your prerogative to be wrong. If you want to wish that I’ll die of CV19, that’s your prerogative to look like a petulant child. I don’t wish any vaccine side effects on you, and truthfully wish you well. I just wish you could do the same for me.</p></p>

        <p>How opinions like this remain highly controversial blows my mind. There’s a very big difference between being anti-vax and not wanting to be a medical guinea pig. Like you, I genuinely hope the vaccine works and it evolves into a viable long term solution, but I’m not willing to be a test subject for it. I’m also of one of the lowest risk groups for all the reasons you mentioned above. </p>
<p>Yet the news has spent a year painting anyone who doesn’t want the vaccine as an insane conspiracy theorist who thinks we’re being injected with microchips to be controlled by 5G. It’s malicious and journalistic malpractice at this point to continue to attack people on that basis. It’s disingenuous at best. I’d wager the vast, vast majority of people who don’t want the vaccine share our same opinion: we have no desire to be injected with an experimental vaccine when the data shows our own immune system is 99.9% capable of defending itself from the virus. </p>
<p>It’s impossible to claim it’s safe because it’s not been long enough to determine that. I genuinely hope the long-term studies show there are little to no risk with taking the vaccine because there are certainly people who are high-risk that will greatly benefit from the vaccine. I’m just not one of those people. </p>
<p>I’m also of the belief that demanding people take an experimental vaccine under the guise of “protecting others” is a very bad precedent to set as well. Your body is your body just as mine is mine. Neither of us have the right to demand that the other receive unwanted medical procedures, experimental or otherwise.</p>

        <p>There’s definitely a knee jerk reaction to get mad and poke fun that you’re scared of becoming a robot slave to our new overlord Bill Gates rather than actually talk out genuine, pretty fair concerns about the vaccine. </p>
<p>Without trying to force you to change your mind, I think it’s worth considering (if for nothing else than to maybe ease some anxiety) that while it’s unprecedented for a vaccine to have been made this quickly, it’s <em>also</em> unprecedented to pour this amount of money, focus, and brainpower into it. </p>
<p>It’s not a substitute for long term evaluation. But on the other hand, a huge reason research can take so long is often just the drag from stuff like funding, collaboration, and life being busy. </p>
<p>i.e., you spend lots of time applying for/waiting to hear back about grants. If you need someone else’s expertise or equipment, you’re working around everyone’s schedules and adding a travel/time cost. Conceiving of the study details and setup, performing it, and collecting data can take a while simply bc the researchers have other stuff going on (and shit happens— maybe some supplies you ordered don’t get on time or the instrument you use is broken). </p>
<p>Plus, you may have to submit a proposal to an ethics committee for approval, who only meets when its members schedules permit and who’ll likely ask you to revise it several times (which means your team needs to find <em>more</em> time...). And the peer review process can take a while in large part because a) the reviewers have their own lives and b) your team has their own lives. </p>
<p>BUT, if you had all the money you could need, constant access to other experts and the best equipment, and nearly 100% focus and devotion from everyone involved... very possible to get done a lot quicker.</p>

        <p>I wish you well and I agree with your words. Intelligent, well expressed and on point. Your description of yourself reads like how I would describe myself; physically, politically and analytically. I didn't fight the zealous wave of friends who booked an appointment for me. Topically fine as I am all for better living through pharmaceuticals and vaccines are a part of this. </p>
<p>I too wanted to wait for a bit and am happy wearing a double mask, avoiding crowds, in fact I will likely perform some iteration of this forever. I had a 380 day streak of spins on my Keiser, and tromped through the woods daily. I workout with weights, practice yoga, eat well etc. Shot number one put me down for 25 days and when I say put down, I mean, unable to leave the couch for longer than 30 minutes. No vaccine in our history has resulted in so many people with so many side effects, none predictable within demographics, prior infections or lot numbers. </p>
<p>Yes, we are discouraged to think critically, analytically or scientifically. And ostracized for doing so,</p>

        <p>I'm the same. I even believe covid is real and I even believe it is MORE DANGEROUS than the flu. But what would be the harm in letting people WFH and do remote school for another year?? The people who want to go to restaurants and bars have been going to them anyway. Everyone is acting like since the vaccine is here, EVERYONE NEEDS TO go back to normal NOW. </p>
<p>I don't go anywhere I'm a SAHM and my kid does remote school and he and his brothers have each other and play safely with trusted friends who also take the virus seriously. My H works from home and we order our groceries by delivery. We are sooooo unlikely to get it or spread it. It's only when they demand that my H goes back into the office and my son goes back to in person schooling that we could potentially become vectors. We have no need for the vaccine... But the vaccines existence is going to cause these things to be required again and then we will need the vaccine!</p>

        <p>I hear ya, and I think that there is also an intelligent anti-vaccine position that can co-exist with yours!</p>
<p>I understand the theory of vaccines and credit them with the (general) elimination of polio, small pox, etc. But I think understanding it as sort of a immune system hack, rather than a wipeout cure, brings clarity to both positions.</p>
<p>The same way lifting weights makes you stronger in the event you need to move specific muscles, a vaccine triggers your immune response to certain surface proteins (mRNA does the same thing, but instead of using a weakened virus, it skips a step and just gives the template to your cells). </p>
<p>Soooo if that analogy fits, we can infer some weak points. Doing squats may help your shotput distance, say, but it won't help you in a 100m dash. <br>
Obviously this is way oversimplified, but if you can imagine the skepticism you feel when you hear a trainer talk about "the miracle 6-pack workout!" or "the fitness shake that replaces your food and gives you a perfect butt!" then you know the feeling I get when someone says "take this vaccine, it'll cure COVID!"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So yes, weight lifting, vaccines, all this can help. But if it's advertised as a miracle cure, don't be surprised if tomorrow it turns out "oh hey, we didn't get the results we wanted....because we need more!"</p>

        <p>wait, i think your argument is objectively incorrect in how it's worded. the proper analogy for a 'miracle workout' would be a vaccine that claims to 'cure all viruses'.</p>
<p>&rt;Doing squats may help your shotput distance, say, but it won't help you in a 100m dash.</p>
<p>this is completely true! but the thing is, the covid vaccine is also targeted <em>directly at covid</em>. i agree that its not any sort of miracle cure, but the way you're using the analogy is unarguably incorrect.</p>

        <p>That's a good point! I suppose I straw manned a bit, it's definitely not reasonable to say that "this vaccine cures all viruses," and I don't think I should imply that anyone thinks that. </p>
<p>What I was trying to get at was that the targeted approach to Covid (like targeting a certain muscle group to work out) excludes the other ways in which to fight a virus.  Squats target the game of shotput, the covid vaccine targets the 'game' of covid</p>
<p>That's all well and good assuming the game doesn't change.... but that's not how viruses seem to work. We know that mutations happen, we know there are opportunity costs to having a large reaction to any infection. </p>
<p>So it's not insane to weigh the two options of vaccine/no vaccine and come out with "yeah I'd rather keep my immune system in a general ready state, rather than focus it all on an infection that doesn't match the reaction that I'd feel comfortable with." </p>

        <p>Thank you for a thoughtful post. This is my first time in this sub and didn’t know what to expect. Perhaps there are more people that think like this than exposure to the news cycle would suggest. I have wavered on my thoughts on the virus and I often do the opposite of what I see the crowd doing. This is your life and I’ll not stand in your way of making the best decision for yourself in regards to your health. Live and let live should be a more popular philosophy than it is. Cheers.</p>

        <p>Well stated. I feel the same way. The vaccine was rushed, which does not mean it is defective, just that it has not been tested enough yet.</p>
<p>I would like to wait a year and compare costs and benefits, and then I might take it.</p>

        <p>Thank you! These are pretty much my thoughts exactly, yet some people in my life—people who are supposed to love and care about me without question—consistently talk down to me as if I’m stupid, “anti-science,” “alt-right,” and whatever other insult they can think of, just because I’d prefer to be cautious about this vaccine. I know it’s selfish that I expect a bunch of other people to take it and prove it’s safe before I’ll consider taking it. I can live with being selfish. I can’t live with whatever potential harm this vaccine could cause.</p>

        <p>My issue with you is you claim to go outside everyday yet refuse to vaccinate. That makes you a likely carrier of COVID-19 at best. In fact, you state that you likely caught it petsitting. So if your, "I spend time outside everyday" isn't an exaggeration, you purposely went into society instead of getting tested and quarantining. After all, you <em>clearly</em> weren't following preventative measures to separate households.</p>
<p>So yes. If I take your post at face-value then much like anti-vaxxers, you actively contribute(d) to the spread and mutation of COVID-19. You yourself might not be an "anti-vaxxer," but you contribute to COVID-19's spread in the same ways.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>South Korea has only vaccinated .1% of its population. Yet it has one of the lowest infection rates in the world. I read Japan and South Australia have similar statistics. If people who refuse to vaccinate were responsible with their trips outside (ie. wearing masks; social distancing; minimizing trips and supporting contact tracing) then the USA's infection rates would be similarly low.</p>

        <p>Dude, I live by myself on a half acre and all but 1 set of neighbors are practically hermits. I can go outside every day and not be within 100’ of another human being. I grow my own food, and supplement what I don’t grow by going to the store once a month. You can “go outside” without “purposely going into society.” I basically lived in voluntary quarantine 99% of the time before CV19. And guess what, when I go somewhere that I’m going to be around people, I wear a mask like I’m asked to do. Are you kidding me with this response?</p>

        <p>No I am not. Check your own rant to the internet, 704sw. Per your own words you:</p>
<p>- go outside every day</p>
<p>- do not social distance from other households (ie. petsitting for your neighbors <em>in their own house</em>)</p>
<p>- do not self-quarantine (see go outside every day and came in close contact with suspected COVID-19 patients)</p>
<p>- do not plan to get vaccinated or stop going outside until you get vaccinated</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PS: Masks are not a replacement for quarantining if you come into close contact with a suspected case of COVID-19. And guess what? <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/feel-like-visiting-just-one-friend-covid-19-lockdown-uw-illustrates-damage-cause/">Coming into close contact with that one neighbor who does not "live like a hermit" gives you a once removed connection to society.</a> That's probably the exact way COVID-19 traveled to you in the first place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>tl;dr I do not see you as above the others because you are different 99% of the time, 704sw. Your words imply you still do not follow preventative measures for that other 1% and that is enough. You <em>do</em> (and already have) contribute(d) to the spread of COVID-19. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you remained in lockdown until you got the vaccine, you likely would not have gotten sick in the first place. You could wait as long as you wanted then and not contribute to the pandemic.</p>

        <p>This same logic applies to yourself and literally every human on the planet, pro-covid vaccination or not.</p>
<p>If you’ve gone to the store even once in the last year then you’ve potentially spread covid (or any other disease). Especially when in so many cases where the carrier doesn’t know they are a carrier because the symptoms are either incredibly mild or non-existent. Masks and distancing are not a fail-safe. Unless you’ve worn a literal hazmat suit every time you’ve left your house or are lucky enough to have every single item you’ve needed delivered to your doorstep, then you yourself have engaged in covid-spreading activity. </p>
<p>OP never once stated they left the house knowingly carrying covid. And just because OP didn’t explicitly state they self-quarantined after finding out their neighbors had covid doesn’t mean OP didn’t do so. You’re filling in informational gaps with your own assumptions with the specific purpose of demonizing OP.</p>

No, it does not. Case in point, I pointed to 3 countries where the citizens are responsibly handling COVID-19 and many people are appropriately following lockdown procedures.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt;  OP never once stated they left the house knowingly carrying covid. And just because OP didn’t explicitly state they self-quarantined after finding out their neighbors had covid doesn’t mean OP didn’t do so. </p>
<p>False. OP specifically stated they went outside <em>everyday</em> and then explicitly stated they believed they had COVID-19 at some point. To insist otherwise (particularly when OP replied to my comment without saying I was incorrect) is to make assumptions to prove <em>your</em> point.</p>
<p>\&rt;  Unless you’ve worn a literal hazmat suit every time you’ve left your house or are lucky enough to have every single item you’ve needed delivered to your doorstep, then you yourself have engaged in covid-spreading activity. </p>
<p>False equivalence. Going outside for essentials is not the same as petsitting for your neighbor or going outside when you suspect you have recently been exposed to COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fix your facts and try again.</p>

        <p>No, I hope he didn't. Just like he chose to see humans as disease vectors, I chose to see him as dog sh*t or a muddy puddle I'd like to not step onto.</p>
<p>It hurts so much when humans reduce other humans to plague rats. It's a type of fancy woke misanthropy that is similar to the way people demonized the 'others' during any fascist authoritarian genocidal time in history.</p>
<p>So, no, I'd rather not have to walk past a misanthropic maniac and breathe his 'hate germs'.  It's like walking among animal abusers and wife beaters.</p>

        <p>Good for you! You want to be seen as a human being! Now please extend the same empathy to the multitude of people you put at risk by violating lockdown procedures. Particularly when it has resulted in you catching COVID-19, as OP believes he has. I assure you that each of those people also wish they were seen as human beings by you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>FYI, as of this point, there have been over 3,051,736 confirmed COVID-19 deaths worldwide. People can fight to keep that death toll as low as possible by being responsible. To me that means taking vaccines, social distancing and following lockdown procedures. What does it mean to you?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PS: Here's a rhetorical question for you. I called out OP for what he wrote in his post on his behavior. I vehemently disagree with his actions and am unafraid to say so. But I never personally attacked or insulted him. Can you say the same towards me? What makes you think you're a better person than I am except for the fact I disagree with you?</p>

        <p>Allow me to trigger you. I've been to 9 states since this started, and will be making that 10 in June. 2 of those states were totally unnecessary, and I only went for recreational reasons. I haven't quarantined at all, and I've done everything in person as much as possible! :)</p>

        <p>a lot of what you said rings true. my personal take on the vaccines are that, yes they are experimental, and there are some unknowns. but the risks of going unvaccinated, both on a personal and societal level, far outweigh the risks of the vaccine. like you said - anecdotally you know a bunch of people who have had the vaccine and not had any ill effects, and you also know people who have had a bad time after contracting covid. </p>
<p>i just wanted to caution you against leaning too far into the type of conspiracy thinking that is common on this subreddit. it's super toxic, and can radicalize people super quickly. you're gonna get a lot of positive feedback for this post, which could lead to you posting more here, and getting more indoctrinated into this worldview. </p>
<p>i hope this doesn't come across as condescending. i just wanted to convey that your post is very reasonable, but the views of this sub at large are not reasonable at all, imo. and it bums me out to see people fall into the extremist viewpoints on this sub.</p>

        <p>I’ve been subscribed here (and have actively participated here) since the beginning of when this sub was created. I don’t have extremist viewpoints, nor do the majority of people here. There are “bad apples” in every batch, and they tend to have the loudest voices. Unfortunately when even the people with what you just called “reasonable” opinions are being ostracized and feel they need to come to non-mainstream communities to not be shit on, it’s very easy for them to fall down a rabbit hole. People go to where they won’t feel unwelcome, but that doesn’t mean everyone there thinks the exact same way. So while you may see this place, or subs like it, as echo chambers, I hope you can understand why other people see the inverse to be true as well. </p>
<p>I respect you for commenting here in a calm and civil manner, and appreciate the discussion. You’ll undoubtedly be downvoted, and I wish it weren’t so. But a lot of people <strong>don’t</strong> come here to be civil, they come here to troll and elicit a certain response, and that’s exactly what happens. Then all you end up seeing is a [deleted] with -100 beside it, and a bunch of angry zealous responses, making it seem much worse here than it really is.</p>
<p>I hope the downvote brigade doesn’t blow up your inbox. Be well.</p>

        <p>yeah, i am personally for everyone medically suitable for getting the vaccine to take it asap (like, not forcibly vaccinated or anything, just they should take it because it seems absolutely reasonable) and this is the most sane post with a 'not getting the vaccine' (at least for now) standpoint i have seen literally anywhere. i do respectfully disagree with your post from a scientific standpoint, but, like, i wish so many other people were like this instead of yelling about how the entire world is brainwashed.</p>

        <p>to me "only idiots would ever get the vaccine" is a pretty extremist view, and i don't think you can argue that's not the prevailing viewpoint here. it's definitely different from the viewpoint in your original post.</p>
