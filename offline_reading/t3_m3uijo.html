    <strong>Remember, all of the propaganda is a non starter without your consent</strong>
    <p><p>I am seeing a ramping up of the propaganda for vaccinating everyone. While I don't think this mandatory vaccination by government decree will happen for most of the world (I'm in Florida and it'll never happen here), they are drawing lines in the sand in terms of making your life very difficult without it.</p>
<p>Today I saw an article that says "Most employees want mandatory COVID vaccinations to return to the office." First of all this is a fake poll. I don't believe a majority believe this for a second. But anyone who answers yes to that question, <em>who thinks they get to have an opinion on whether I get a vaccine,</em> is a fascist. This is unadulterated medical fascism. Ironically this viewpoint is held more often by people who call themselves anti fascist. Your employer might try this, but with enough pushback they won't implement it. Use the religious and medical exemption card in numbers and HR will back down. They don't want lawsuits.</p>
<p>I saw another ad on YouTube today calling to vaccinate ALL, with women writing messages on their masks that they want the vaccine so they can hug their family members again. People - hug  your family with or without the shot. With or without their permission. The asymptomatic myth has long been exposed.</p>
<p>Anytime you see their ads, give a little "No thanks" in your head and go do the opposite of what they just recommended just out of spite, even if you weren't going to do it before.</p>
<p>As governments start to roll back some restrictions, now is the time we step on the gas to accelerate forward as they back up.</p>
<p>Peace and love to my brothers and sisters in places like Israel and Canada who have a harder fight than we do in Florida.</p></p>

        <p>Survey Methodology </p>
<p>"This survey was conducted online within the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of Glassdoor from February 16-18, 2021 among 2,072 adults ages 18 and older, among whom 1,149 are employed and 571 are currently working from home due to COVID-19. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. For complete survey methodology, including weighting variables and subgroup sample sizes, please contact pr@glassdoor.com."</p>
<p>So 2000 random online assholes who haven't even been verified for employment at all went online and hit buttons. I mean at the very least they could have asked about industry, age, company position.
And then "credible" news sources including CBS, run with it as the voice of all Americans.</p>
<p>There's isn't a single question you could ask any number of people online that I would give credit to. You have no clue who responded to this garbage. Nothing has been verified and for all we know children or Canadians responded to the survey. </p>
<p>I hate all politicians but the Liberals have really taken the trophy as most despicable humans on earth. They're so lazy and submissive that they'll just eat up and digest even the stinkiest of Bullshit as long as its served up by their masters.</p>

        <p>Thank you. If you're interested I found through the links a breakdown of the exact stats <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/covid-19-return-to-work-survey/">here</a></p>

        <p>I don't believe any polls ever since the 2016 election. Who is proctoring the poll? What is their agenda? I believe damn near every political poll ever taken has a confirmation bias, which is to say a goal for the end of the poll that is predetermined before it is conducted. And they will do whatever manipulation or mental gymnastics it takes to get to that end.</p>
<p>If you go to West Hollywood and do a poll on Trump's approval rating during the virus, when it's 1% you can't then extrapolate that and say "99% of Americans polled in a recent survey disapprove of Trump" and not mention you went to the most liberal zip code in the country.</p>

        <p>Its not so much fake as it its a ridiculous thing for a news organization like CBS to use as a source if credible information. Anyone anywhere could have taken that poll. It tells us nothing of value other than 76% of those 2000 are fascist pieces of shit.</p>

        <p>Then I apologize for shitting on you but you made a few errors in not answering my stuff back and what not but whatever im fine man. So since youre being serious ill give you a genuine response hopefully you can see where I'm coming from. </p>
<p>I am just a bit shocked at things people point to as news or things we should take seriously.</p>
<p>CBS to use that poll and run that story making it seem like an overwhelming majority of peoples co workers want them to submit to vaccine in to retain their normal life back, is so irresponsible and kinda disturbing actually. 
You'd think that with a story like that they may want to not only have a MUCH larger sample size but also a little more information on who these people are.</p>
<p>I dont think the vaccines got microchips or anything like that. I think this is pandemic is solely political and profit driven but the virus is real the theater around it is not. 
The vaccine push makes a lot of people rich thats it. The vaccines not gonna kill everyone. They want everyone to live and not only live but think they need it every year to live. Thats a Lotta jabs year over year and Lots of $$$$$$$ to be made. </p>
<p>And the level that they are trying to push a vaccine that was made in record shattering time and with no long term study done onto the world population is somewhat scary.</p>
<p>I know you like a hypothetical. So what if we find out 10 years from now that teen girls who got the vaccine are now having major issues getting pregnant. Like hundreds of thousands in the US but millions globally because the whole world got it. And it turns out to be related to the vaccines. What do we do then? Just go oh well we thought it was the right thing to do? All the profits have been made the bloods spilled what now?</p>
<p>I respect personal choice if you want the vaccine and you want your kids to have the vaccine then bring the whole family and get a discount. Just don't expect me and my family to follow suit to make you feel better. </p>
<p>And if people are trying to use the argument that we all need to get it to achieve herd immunity. Well then if I need a vaccine to make your vaccine work. Then that's not a very good vaccine to me. So ill pass. No thanks im in perfect health and dont live with anyone who's high risk so I have zero intention of getting it.</p>
<p>And I hate Trump and Republicans too. This isn't a political thing for me. I just want to go to my gym and not suffocate while I'm trying to do cardio. I dont think I'm asking for crazy shit.</p>

        <p>Thanks for apologising. I appreciate that. I will say the main reason I didn't not respond too much to your direct questions is that, 1. I'm more interested in your opinions then getting drawn into a debate, which maybe I should have made clearer early on, so sorry for that and 2. You came on aggressive from your first post accusing me of defending fascism and not having a functioning brain and I felt engaging in that debate would involve too many emotions, which was not my goal. </p>
<p>So, in the interest of fairness I'll respond to one point you raised in your hypothetical. If, 10 years down the track we find out it was actually harmful then that will be horrible and I really hope that doesn't happen. But, we can't see the future and we shouldn't go around writing about what things might happen. There are examples of this happening, like asbestos. Now, that is different from a company covering up known side-effects, and if it is revealed they knew something and hid it, then I hope they get prosecuted. </p>
<p>Again, thanks for your time today. No hard feelings.</p>

        <p>So, what your answers have told me is that your own biases probably play a bigger role than data. So there is nothing anyone could show you one way or the other that would change your mind. </p>

        <p>There's a radio ad running in Boston. I drive around a lot for work so I hear it several times a day. </p>
<p>But basically its supposed to be the voice of a nurse and she's telling everyone how tough the last year has been and she's been fighting to keep everyone protected but now she needs you good little boys and girls to protect her and get the vaccine. She goes onto say we can never return to normal until all of us are vaccinated. It over the top trying to pull at your heart strings and make it seem like the only thing you can do is get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Its such over the top propaganda and its scary to think so many people are falling for this clear bullshit. And even scarier at how righteous they are about it. Its clown world.</p>
