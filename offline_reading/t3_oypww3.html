    <strong>You don't need antibody dependent enhancement for the vaccine to make the virus more lethal, it can happen in multiple ways</strong>
    <p><p>I want to start out by saying that I don't claim that it's guaranteed the vaccine will make the virus more lethal. This is going to depend on the long term effectiveness of this vaccine, which only time will tell. The numbers so far however are disappointing, suggesting the effectiveness declines within months. Israeli elderly vaccinated in january now seem to have no meaningful protection left.</p>
<p>One potential concern with the vaccine you have heard about is antibody dependent enhancement, something that can happen in multiple ways.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only factor to be concerned about.</p>
<p>It's generally the case with COVID-19 that the rate of death is lower during the summer months than during the winter months. Human beings are overall healthier during the summer months, for multiple reasons. One reason is that if you do get infected with COVID-19 in the summer, you're less at risk of coinfection with other viruses like RSV or influenza. In the Netherlands, 18.6% of ICU patients died in may and june 2020. In november and december 2020, 32.6% of ICU patients died.</p>
<p>Throughout this pandemic, the big worry has been that hospitals would be unable to cope. If we take the theoretical scenario in which the vaccines become completely useless by oktober of this year, then it may actually be in your own favor to be unvaccinated, if it means that you're infected earlier. </p>
<p>If the vaccines fail, hospitals are likely to be overwhelmed this winter, which means that every "antivaxxer" who is hospitalized now rather than during the winter and develops long term immunity in the process benefits both from receiving higher quality treatment and indirectly helps the vaccinated people, by reducing the load on hospitals during the winter peak.</p>
<p>Remember, we want to "flatten the curve". If unvaccinated people go through infections earlier because it takes time for full vaccine resistance to occur, unvaccinated people are flattening the curve. If unvaccinated people are currently causing breakthrough infections to occur in the vaccinated people, they're also protecting those vaccinated people against the prospect of being part of a vaccine failure induced winter wave.</p>
<p>Second, there are other mechanisms through which the vaccine can enhance the infection.</p>
<p>Antibody dependent enhancement is a relatively narrow term, referring to a situation in which the antibodies themselves worsen the disease, typically by allowing virus particles to replicate in macrophages. </p>
<p>Another problem you potentially face is original antigenic sin, in which the body is simply prohibited from developing effective antibodies against a new strain of the virus, because it already has less effective antibodies that are recalled upon a new infection. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21813667/">That's what we saw with people vaccinated against influenza during the swine flu outbreak.</a> One possible mechanism involved here is that your naive B cells are depleted by the generation of memory B cells, thus you simply don't have the immunological capacity to generate a problem response.</p>
<p>Finally, there's a third problem we're dealing with, which is that vaccinated elderly are going to be receiving a booster shot. We've known for a while now, that the vaccination has the effect of "pulling forward" a number of infections. The reason for this appears to be that many of your body's white blood cells are recruited towards the injection site, thus leaving the rest of your body more susceptible to infection by the virus.</p>
<p>What this means is that if you become infected with COVID-19 shortly before or after your third dose, the third dose is likely to have the effect of merely making you more vulnerable to the virus.</p>
<p>Fourth, there's a specific problem we have witnessed with the toxic spike protein.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-021-01332-z">There is evidence that the spike protein damages our hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.</a> These are the cells in our body responsible for making our white blood cells. If this is also true for the spike proteins released into our blood after vaccination, we would expect reduced immune efficiacy too.</p>
<p>These are a number of potential problems we're faced with. Only time can tell whether the vaccines will reduce deaths this winter.</p></p>

        <p>Also pathogenic priming. I thought it was the same thing as ade but this paper explains the difference. </p>

        <p>Great write up. I hadnâ€™t actually thought about point #3, so thank you for pointing it out.</p>
