    <strong>PSA: HIPAA; Vaccine Mandates and EUAs</strong>
    <p><h2>HIPAA</h2>
<p>HIPAA controls what medical providers (your doctor, etc) can reveal about you to third parties without your permission (basically nothing). </p>
<p><strong>HIPAA does not in any way, shape, or form prevent YOU from revealing your medical info.</strong> </p>
<p>It also does not prevent anyone from asking you about your medical info (basic manners and courtesy should prevent those questions, but oh well...). Legally, they can ask you and you can answer - HIPAA has nothing to do with such interactions. </p>
<p>Now, if they were to ask your medical provider if you’d been vaccinated and your medical provider told them the answer without first getting your permission... then <em>that</em> would almost certainly be a HIPAA violation. </p>
<h2>Vaccine Mandates</h2>
<p>In general, these are legal. </p>
<p>However, that is for FDA approved vaccines, which the covid vaccines are NOT. The covid vaccines are under an EUA, and this is a legally gray area because the issue has not been heard and settled in courts yet (it’s getting there). </p>
<p>On one hand, the law allowing EUAs specifically requires that people be made aware of their option to refuse. The FDA explicitly agrees with this: its official position is that EUA vaccines may not be mandated. </p>
<p>On the other hand ... stupid flu makes people stupid, so who knows? </p>
<p>This should be clear cut based on the law and the FDA’s own stance, but people are stupid lately so it’s not. </p>
<p>Some employers and schools are mandating vaccines. This does NOT mean that they are legally allowed to do so - they are operating in a gray area that is not necessarily in their favor. </p>
<p>Organizations - schools, corps, etc - often do things that they <strong>know</strong> are legally unenforceable. They do this because they also know that you are likely to (incorrectly) assume that they <em>are</em> legally enforceable; it’ll never get to court because you’ll just comply, and they are right in most cases. A good example of this is noncompete agreements- most are completely unenforceable, but employees don’t know that so they are effective (and therefore used) anyway. </p>
<p><strong>In this instance, there is a good chance that the law is on your side.</strong> </p>
<p>But more than that, there is a good chance that <em>many</em> (not all!) of these “mandates” are just pressure with no follow through. They will huff and they will puff and at the end of the day they will likely back off because if you get fired and sue there is a good chance you win. </p>
<p>(<strong>Bonus</strong>: if you are coerced into taking the vaccine, and wind up with adverse reactions, definitely sue - based on today’s laws, you will have an excellent case as they went against the FDA’s position and clear statutory language and you were harmed as a result. Your odds of winning such a suit are higher than if you just challenge the mandate/firing.) </p>
<p><strong>So what should you do if you are coerced with a mandate?</strong></p>
<p>You have options (other than taking the vaccine)! </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ignore it outright unless and until it escalates to “show proof of vaccination or you are fired” (this will likely work in many cases; many are just putting on a show and they do not actually want to incur liability); I strongly recommend this one to start if you are not up for potential litigation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if pressed, simply provide them with the law on EUAs and the FDA’s own guidance stating it must be optional</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chat with a local lawyer (always get 3 opinions, consults are usually free or cheap)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wait for them to fire you and <em>absolutely</em> sue (your odds at this point in time are good)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on your own time, somehow acquire a pretty little covid vax card and present it to them; they will be happy that you played the game and that will be the end of it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, playing the game is harmful - it indicates consent of these things. If you can afford to not play the game, that is the better option. </p>
<p>But do not needlessly put yourself in a bad situation or deplete your resources unless and until you are ready to commit to fighting for your position; doing so simply impairs your ability to stand up for yourself in the future and provides no benefit.</p></p>

        <p>Do they require you bring an ID to the vaccination site? Like to enter you into a database? I mean I don’t see why they’d want to do that and allow people without an ID to spread the virus... just trying to figure out if one can get caught by them looking you up in a system</p>

        <p>No. Government incompetence at it's finest. They stumbled all over themselves to rush this nonsense out but they have no access to any database of any kind. Not to check you off or input your data. A lot of these places where they are doing the injections are just community centers and parking lots. The only thing they have to hand out are the paper cards.</p>

        <p>Just take a picture of the card on your phone and show them the pic on your screen.  Then be like, uhhh why do you need the actual card, here is a picture of it.  If I can fake a picture I can fake a card.  Besides you can show your license, auto insurance etc on your screen.  Even get on a plan without a piece of paper.</p>
