<title>Friendly discussion. I feel like Covid is real. It is worse than the cold and too many people are dying. I don't know if lockdowns are the answer but I do believe that Covid deaths are real. What do you think?</title>

    <strong>Friendly discussion. I feel like Covid is real. It is worse than the cold and too many people are dying. I don't know if lockdowns are the answer but I do believe that Covid deaths are real. What do you think?</strong>
    <p><p>The News said 4000 people died in 1 day</p>
<p>L.A is being over run </p>
<p>over 1 in 1000 Americans have died</p>
<p>To me those numbers are way too big to fake. Too many people would have to be in on it.</p>
<p>Long Covid seems to be something that the flu can't cause. </p>
<p>I know the news lies but these lies are way too big to not be real.</p></p>

        <p>30,000 people died in my town alone yesterday. </p>
<p>See how easy i can pull out some numbers and present it to you. Without any evidence to back up my claims, why would you believe me. Why do you believe the numbers you are being given are true?</p>

        <p>But they can't just pull numbers out. They have to have the bodies and death certficates and too many people would have to fake that</p>
<p>too many health care workers would have to be lying to us about over flowing hospitals.</p>
<p>I understand why you don't trust the media. They lie and lie but this isn't weapons of mass desturction too many people would have to be in on this for it to work</p>

        <p>Hospitals are always overflowing this time of year. Deaths always increase this time of year. You dont need hospital workers in on fudging numbers of deaths. Its just those behind the screens that work with the death count. Death certificates don't even need to exist.</p>

<p>Why would common doctors and nurses lie though? They aren't the illuminity. They aren't in on the great reset. They are just common people</p>

        <p>What are they lying about? </p>
<p>Hospitals are busy this time of year. Thats true. </p>
<p>People die. Thats true. </p>
<p>Most deaths are being counted as covid. Thats true, even if covid truly wasn't the case. </p>
<p>Covid symptoms are exactly the same as the common cold and flu. So even your most genuine nurse, may strongly believe the patient died from covid even though the previous year they'd not think twice about marking it down as the flu.</p>

        <p>And remember, if anyone dies within a certain time frame after testing positive for covid - even if they have no symptoms. They are added to the covid death numbers. </p>

        <p>Are they doing that?</p>
<p>So like if you are fine but tested postive but are asymtamtic and you get a unrealted heart attack they will say it's covid?</p>
<p>They can't do that can they? If they are someone would say something right or is it like the Catholic Church thing where so many people just look the other way?</p>

        <p>They are doing that. In the UK its any deaths within 28 days of a positive test that are classed as a covid death. </p>
<p>People are not seeing this because the fear is being pumped into them with numbers of cases and deaths daily. Theyre being to they need to save lives and putting a level of responsibility of people when there really is no need. </p>
<p>When you peel back and look at it all for how it actually is, it is disgusting the manipulation theyre using on people.</p>

        <p>They’re way too big to be real. How many people  do you know that have died from Covid? </p>
<p>It’s a real bad flu. Flus kill people. Old people especially.  I think they are counting all deaths of people whom have had Covid at any point. </p>
<p>It’s reported that anyone whom dies 1.5 months after testing positive. Regardless of the cause of death gets a Covid stamp. </p>
<p>Dont quote me on 1.5 months. </p>

If you had the flu in previous years or even now and it "weakened your heart" and you subsequently died would your death have been or would even now be listed as death by flu? 
Or death by Snu Snu?</p>

<p>Even if it's just a really bad flu a lot of people are dying. </p>
<p>I am not saying lockdowns and vaccines are the answer just that the deaths are real </p>
<p>I don't think that if someone dies of a gun shot and they had covid they would count it as covid</p>
<p>If covid caused you to have a weakened heart and then you had a heart attack covid did cause your death</p>
<p>I don't know anyone who has died and in fact everyone I know who got covid is back to normal but other people have lost lots of loved ones. My friends lost 4 people to it</p>

        <p>I am not sure I follow the logic of "numbers too big to be fakes"</p>
<p>For what it is worth, I also think it's a virus, that even kills some people, mostly old people at that.</p>
<p>But I also think the deaths rates are exaggerated.</p>
<p>I also think covid is being used as a vehicle to take away our rights and freedoms.</p>

        <p>I agree that our rates on a global scale our all gone and I am scared but my view was the virus was very deadly. </p>
<p>How exaggerated do you think the deaths are? I don't think they are exaggerated and I also don't want old people to die as I am sure you don't either. </p>
<p>you are right though 9/11 was used to take our rights but it was a real attack and real people died. </p>
<p>rather 9/11 was a inside job or not 3000 people died</p>
<p>Same with this virus rather made in a lab or not people are dying and I just don't want people to think those bodies are fake</p>

        <p>Unless the government decides to pay everyone a full wage to stay home. Shutting down businesses and controlling peoples movements only hinder us and creates negative outcomes.</p>
<p>Do you feel guilty for businesses closing down and people losing their jobs, no and you shouldn’t. If you have pre existing health conditions and you put yourself at risk why am I liable. </p>
<p>Whenever you go outside it is inevitable that you will face dangers one way or the other. It should be up to you to decide wether that danger is still worth the risk of going outside. </p>
<p>We need some middle ground here and specifically with high risk people having the resources necessary to be safe while also allowing low risk people the opportunity to work and live as they see fit.</p>

<p>You could be right I am just so confused. I know the media lies about everything so they could be lying about this too I thought the numbers were to big to fake but maybe they aren't as big as they seem.</p>

<p>Thank you for answering my questions.</p>
<p>Let me ask you another question please.  Do you think this is important information for the media to report?  We are allegedly in some major pandemic where lots of people are dying right?  But the media never mentions the big picture.</p>
<p>Context is important. If 400,000 Americans died in 2019 from all causes then 600,000 deaths by in 2020 would be an increase of 50%.  Can you see why this is important context?</p>

        <p>Covid is real, but the deaths are not.</p>
<p>If you take a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/p_vAQyVlXzU">Ivor Cummins YouTube channel</a> and have a look at his 'Crucial Viral Updates', you will see he is doing fantastic analysis about the true impacts of the covid pandemic using hard data and well established historical science. The real science, not "The Science™" and it's important to know the difference. </p>
<p>Essentially, when we look at all cause mortality aka just straight up numbers of people dying in various geographic denominations, we can see that Covid has had no significant effect on worldwide mortality rates. If there really was a new "deadly virus" which had killed just under 2 million people in a year, who would <em>not have died if not for their Covid infection,</em> then we would see anomalous spikes everywhere in all cause mortality charts for 2020. But this is not what we see at all. Instead, we see normal numbers when comparing 2020 to history. The "growth rate" of overall global mortality in 2020 is <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/death-rate">identical to 2019,</a> and if you peruse Ivor's videos you will come to learn that in many places, 2017-2018 were <em>worse</em> years than 2020 as far as overall deaths. </p>
<p>So how is it possible to have 2 million "extra" deaths that don't even register as a blip on the charts?</p>
<p>Well, strictly speaking, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dxLDJJb1_KI">But this is how that perspective is forced</a></p>
<p>At the four minute mark of the above video, it is revealed that anyone in the UK who tests positive and then dies is classified as a covid death. <em>Even a year later.</em> You could test positive for covid in March, recover, be fine for 6 months, die of a heart attack in the summer, and <em>still</em> be ruled a covid death based on the positive test in March. That's literally what they're doing in the UK.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the US, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/watch-dr-birx-we-have-very-liberal-recording-of-covid-deaths-if-they-test-positive-we-are-counting-that">they are taking a very liberal approach to the recording of covid deaths</a>.</p>
<p><em>"Birx explained that COVID-19 deaths in the United States have “very liberal” recording guidance, noting that anyone who tests positive for the virus and dies would be included in their numbers of coronavirus deaths."</em></p>
<p>And not only are they taking a "liberal approach", they are even <a href="https://youtu.be/sijMOb6DR-w">providing monetary incentive for Docs/hospitals to classify deaths as Covid over other causes.</a></p>
<p>So there you have it, straight from the horses mouth. It turns out that these "death counters" are not counting "covid deaths" at all. Instead what we are talking about is people who have had a positive PCR test, and then died. Not the same thing by a long stretch, especially when considering the monetary incentive in the US. And while I've only talked about the UK and US, the entire rest of the world are all using the PCR test and following similar "loose" counting protocols.</p>
<p>And that's why we've got people who <a href="https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2020/12/17/in-colorado-theyre-counting-gun-shot-fatalities-as-covid-deaths-n2581730">were shot to death</a>, people who <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/man-who-died-after-falling-from-ladder-ruled-a-coronavirus-death-by-doctors-report/ar-BB1bd6ND">fell of a ladder,</a> people who <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/florida-man-killed-crash-listed-covid-19-death-raising-doubts-over-health-data-1518994">died in auto accidents,</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/04/25/first-recorded-covid-death-in-us-was-from-massive-heart-attack-autopsy-says-9422714">massive heart attacks,</a> and <a href="https://www.kgw.com/mobile/article/news/investigations/questions-over-the-accuracy-of-how-the-state-tracks-covid-deaths/283-0b1b7b6c-695e-4313-92cf-a4cfd7510721">cancer deaths</a> all being counted as 'covid deaths'.</p>
<p>It's a sham, it's forced perspective. People die every day by the <em>hundreds of thousands</em> and we never batted an eye before. Even if the numbers were <em>not</em> grossly inflated, the '2 million covid deaths' kinda seems like a drop in the bucket when you realize that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/births-and-deaths"><em>55 million</em> people died of 'normal stuff' back in 2015</a> and we never freaked out and started blaming each other for that. 55 million dead in a year was just business as usual until 2020 when suddenly death is not allowed anymore. The hysteria is entirely media driven and is not warranted.</p>
<p>Covid is real, but it is not causing the deaths of any significant number of people. Poor metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory health are still the leading causes of death worldwide, and while covid may indeed exacerbate these problems in a small minority, for the most part covid is simply "tagging along for the ride" rather than driving anything usual.</p>

        <p>Ivor Cummins channel, the very first link, will clear it up nicely for you, but there's a lot of info to unpack and yes it will take some time to get up to speed. I've seen you voicing your concerns about covid being halfway to the Spanish flu in here and Ivor Cummins can assure you it's nowhere close. Just jump to his latest video for a historical comparison.</p>
<p>Also, the source I cited for the monetary incentives is congressional Rep. Blaine Leutkemeyer and CDC director Robert Redfield discussing the monetary incentives for covid classification. Rep. Leutkemeyer voices his concerns over "conflicts of interest" and Redfield agrees that it "could be a problem". It is very real despite what the fact checkers say.</p>
<p>Thanks for the compliment. Information is the doorway to knowledge. Good luck, have fun.</p>

        <p>&rt;I know the news lies</p>
<p>Good for you! But why take anything they claim as true if you can't verify it for yourself? Why believe a known liar in the first place? Isn't at the very least complete skepticism appropriate if someone is known to shove complete garbage down your throat?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; but these lies are way too big to not be real.</p>
<p>Why though? The gains are equally massive - complete worldwide and severe fascism!</p>
<p>It's orgasmic for the psychopaths in power - you can be sure about that. They utterly dominated and enslaved billions of people, forced enormous amounts into despair, suicide, extreme suffering, poverty and desperation. </p>
<p>The fascist scum will send their armed thugs after you to cage if you have green crumbles in your cigarette - and openly murder you if you resist this blatant and severe crime of theirs, and you think these people care about your wellbeing? </p>
<p>What would it take you to convince you that they not only don't care about your wellbeing, but want you to be as dependent, sick, miserable, enslaved, ignorant and dumb as possible so they can boss you around and control you more easily?</p>

        <p>Point by point</p>
<p>I agree and I am skeptical which is why I am here in the first place. I am also on consprice and US empire and a bunch of others I just thought the death numbers were too big to fake.</p>
<p>To me the bigger a conspricacy the more people it takes and the more people it takes the more likely we would know it's fake. Like with the war on terror early on wesley clark spilled the beans and a bunch of others. Everyone could till the war on terror was fake because it was too big</p>
<p>Something like michael Hashtings being murdered by a remote contorl car is much more likely cause it is smaller. </p>
<p>I agree 100 percent with the rest of your post. They starve little kids in yemen and I don't know about these vaccines because of that but time will tell </p>
