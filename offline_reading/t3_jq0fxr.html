    <strong>An American's Guide to the New Normal in 2021</strong>
    <p><p>This post is just to express my own personal predictions of how this will play out. I have no inside information, this is just as it see it going. I want a record of it to compare it to in about six or seven months.  </p>
<p>Nothing will fundamentally change from today until January 21st, 2021. </p>
<p>Trump has no incentive to change course, some states might roll out new mandates. Cases will continue to climb. </p>
<p>Joe Biden will be sworn in during a very socially distanced and sterile inauguration. He will announce a National Mask Mandate, much like Trump's Muslim ban within in the first week in office. This may or may not be ruled unconstitutional, it doesn't matter though. He'll have done it, so, he'll be able to say it was effective (and the added bonus of condemning a conservative majority in the courts). States will rollout lockdowns(much more strict than the originals, "see we're tough on Covid and really mean business this time") and red states that are hesitant will face tremendous pressure from the White House to do so. I would expect threats of funding being pulled... etc. </p>
<p>During this time data will come out reflecting that PCR cycles will be scaled down. This will basically be swept under the rug and not picked up much at all by MSM... but they want to cover their ass. "See the science says."</p>
<p>Cases will drop off a cliff, but the CFR will be skewed toward a higher percentage (threat of Covid will loom making all of the testing, tracing, and other intrusions in life necessary and common place) - I would imagine a rather large scale push for tracking apps, showing recent test results and/or vaccination status. It may be during this time that this subreddit and others like it will be purged, twitter accounts, etc. Even some of the doomer subs will be purged, like r/ ChinaFlu. </p>
<p>With pesky Orange Twitler out of the way ;-). There will be no one to disrupt our "foriegn cooperation". America can return to the halcyon days of Obama neoliberalism. Not sure if mask mandates will be done away with or not during this time, maybe, maybe not. I would expect that they would remain a requirement for air travel, for at least a while. </p>
<p>Lockdown will end, at some point, but not until a lot of the transformation of societal restructuring will have taken place. I would expect a lot of private land to be foreclosed on, this will result in debt relief being offered to the banks, which will be writing off too much debt like in 2008. Cities will begin to look increasingly automated and contact less. The gig economy will continue to grow. Healthcare costs will continue to mount higher to pay for all of these tests and tracing, tracking programs. </p>
<p>The pandemic will end, but the infrastructure it helped usher in will remain. American industry will continue to be outsourced, outpacing what it is now. The service economy will not be able to make a large enough rebound to remain immune from being swallowed up by the big players. Every restaurant will be Taco Bell ;-) That's a Demolition Man reference for those who don't know. </p>
<p>The cultural revolution (wokeness) will remain unimpeded and unchallenged by any meaningful authority.  It will continue to seep into our institutions, entertainment and culture like the poison it is. Personal relationships will continue to be strained upon the ever evolving fault lines created by the cultural revolution. Old signifiers like left and right will continue to realign, but ultimately devolve into meaninglessness as power will continue to centralize. Corporate power will further subvert and test the concept of sovereign nations. </p>
<p>And something, something, Great Reset. Utopia for a very select few, hell on Earth for the vast, overwhelming majority.  All of this while our Earth still is being desecrated and raped by these industrialists. Only, most manufacturing will be in places far away from the eyes of most Western nations. We will instead see our "greener, safer" futures materialize. While the air quality will continue to decline, our soil further erodes (due to monocropping and other industrialized farming techniques), and our food becomes less nutritious. </p>
<p>Good news? I don't think it is hopeless. It may be almost hopeless... but there are choices we can all make that can derail our crash course with the destiny laid out for us by ghouls like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Save your money - the goal is to financially drain the public. </li>
<li>If you live on property that supports this, learn to grow your own food. If you don't, drive 30 minutes out of town and buy food from a local farmer. </li>
<li>Become real particular with where you shop. Avoid big box stores if possible, avoid Amazon altogether if you can. </li>
<li>Seek out disruptive tech, join a social media platform like mastodon. Leave Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, if at all possible. If you can't leave, try and curtail your engagement. </li>
<li>Work to find communities of like minded folk IRL. They don't have to be anti-New Normal, understand that at this point in time, we might be a bit on the fringe.</li>
<li>Strengthen your body, clean up your diet, and work on your fitness, this will help your mental health and resilience. You are going to need it.</li>
<li>Take it easy on the booze and drugs. Moderation is important.  </li>
</ol>
<p>If anyone has any other suggestions, or disagree with me in any way. If you want to provide another perspective, please feel free to add.</p></p>

        <p>What’s for damn sure: Dementia Joe ran solely on covid and a bad economy and SO MANY DEAD!!!! Now the Dems have to show NO dead and a robust economy.  Let’s see how all this plays out.  </p>
<p>But the fact the rest of the world’s leaders are slobbering over Joe?!  Yeah....this ain’t a real novel virus.  It’s a bad flu.  But the fuckers figured out how to work it and get Globalism back.</p>

        <p>I agree with your recommendations, and I'd add that people and organizations that are anti-New Normal without resorting to the extreme partisanship and hatred that's so common these days in America. The right message may be able to appeal to Republicans and Democrats. Not everyone who voted for Biden wants lockdowns and mask mandates, some voted based on entirely different issues. Calling all your opponents evil won't help anything.</p>
<p>In my opinion, RFK Jr. is someone who is worthy of support. Yes he's fringe now, but if anything like the future you've laid out comes to pass, I'd expect more and more opposition to build to medical tyranny, and a figure like RFK Jr. could get more and more attention. He hasn't actually ran for political office, but maybe that would change if he gets enough attention and no other worthy candidates emerge.</p>

        <p>I am so glad to hear that more people are discovering RFK Jr., and I think you're right, he is the perfect leader for this movement. He is one of the few fighting for freedom that isn't pro-Trump (not that being pro Trump is automatically a bad thing, it's just as you said, alienating). </p>
<p>I subscribe to his newsletter and donate to Childrenshealthdefense.org when I can. </p>
<p>I would also suggest checking out his podcast with Professor Mark Crispin Miller, who is on the left vis-a-vis Noam Chomsky about how the modern left has betrayed almost every value they previously held. </p>

        <p>I think you fail to realise that this lockdown is nearly world wide. The point is control in one of the largest super powers in the current world. Why America was so great is best the president can have some extreme power compared to many of the other countries prime ministers and the like. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is much of the reason in many of the newly written acts they give an appointed public health chief so much power, because a prime minister actually cant make that kind of authority on the fly. This is ofcourse unless the people let him which we seen in Australia</p>

        <p>I don't fail to realize this at all. This is a global coup, but it is naive to think each country doesn't have its own unique signature. The end goal is the same, but the US will not go exactly the same way Canada does or vice versa. Same can be said for other countries, some put the authoritarian lock on right away. Others waited. Etc. </p>
<p>Doesn't mean it's hopeless and it doesn't do us any good to act as though it is. </p>
<p>There are paths we took to bring us here and I refuse to believe, despite how unstoppable this is, that there aren't alternative paths we can take to lead us to a different result, regardless of what the plan is.</p>
