    <strong>I'm about to start working at a midwest university in a new department named COVID Operations, and oh boy are the higher ups doomers.</strong>
    <p><p>Even during my interview (WHICH I NAILED), my newly found bosses were already explaining to me that the University is already planning to still be doing all the masks, social distancing, quarantine dorms, and no eating in dining halls into the beginning of 2022. fuck....</p>
<p>From what I've seen so far, this department has made it's fair share of mistakes, for example, put healthy students that tested negative into a quarantine dorm with students that tested positive, which is outrageous in my eyes.</p>
<p>I got and wanted this job because I feel like I can make a difference and get society back to normal, but my bosses are doctors and report directly to the university president. Should I speak up when they make obvious mistakes and over react to situations on campus, and give my input on the best path to take forward? </p>
<p>I know these people won't like my dissenting opinions as I tend to value individual freedom and liberty, over these abitrary rules we have in place on the campus. I mean we literally don't let students eat in the dining halls, but the lines to get food to-go is INSIDE and the line takes 40 minutes to get through, technically it would be safer to let them eat their food inside for 20 minutes then just leave.</p>
<p>Lastly, I do think COVID is real and we do need to take some precautions, like healthier diet and exercise, and better hygiene, but I think the response to this is so over blown. Wish me luck, I start Monday with these doomers.</p></p>

        <p>Good luck OP. I work at a university hospital microbiology lab. I understand what you’re going through. Feel free to message me. I’ve had to talk to some doctors myself, can offer advice as needed.</p>

        <p>You might be able to talk some sense into them when it comes to the really ridiculous, self-contradictory rules - like the 40 minutes in line vs 20 minutes eating thing. Ideally they wouldn't be worried about it at all, but if they're gonna doom, at least the rules will be consistent with each other.</p>

        <p>Good luck. If they start to notice that your values and goals don't align with their "values and goals" you probably won't make it past your probationary period. Universities are their own cults now a days and if you display any sliver of free thought or opposing opinions, they'll replace you in an instant. I think the first thing you should do is to find like minded individuals to team up with if you really want to try to make a difference. Formulate ideas and plans together instead of cornering leadership decisions on your own. Otherwise you'll be a safety threat and dismissed on the spot.</p>

        <p>Avoid college right now. Just do online community college to earn credits, to stay on track to graduate on time.</p>
<p>It's cheaper, and easier classes. I did my last two semesters in this pandemic, and it was just awful. Now I'm working at the University where I graduated from and can see why it was awful.</p>

        <p>There is a real possibility that the University system will devolve into a handful of well known universities offering vast online instruction without regard to geography and as a result taking market share away from local and regional, less well known universities. </p>
<p>If students can’t experience the college life, what’s the point of being physically present at public and private universities? </p>
<p>I have three kids in out of state universities and I’m really wondering why I’m paying regular tuition and fees for an online experience. It’s not sustainable and the various University “ofs” are currently rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic with their myopic view of COVID culture and its ability to obviate their usefulness.</p>
