        <p>Well.... if they didn't lockdown those numbers could be far higher is the counterpoint to that graph.</p>

        <p>Sure.  But how long can they keep doing this? What are these interruptions doing to society?</p>
<p>People keep.saying we are at war with COVID but a society is always at war with a large number of things.  Unhappiness, lack of cohesiveness, poverty, unemployment, etc...</p>

        <p>At what point do you consider the effects of these lockdowns on the society at large though? Lockdowns may lower case numbers, and it would be understandable if it were the bubonic plague but it's not. Lockdowns cause more damage than COVID ever could unchecked and that's what's most concering.</p>
<p>If we looked at statistics like this showing suicide rates I can bet that we'd see a correlation with lockdowns - and more people have died by suicide than from COVID, and that's just suicide, not including every other cause of death, nor what other baggage it brings by economic issues, and the sever mental health issues it's causing for this generation amd generations to come.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are the equivalent of stopping people from using their automobiles on the road because we've had a couple of car accidents.</p>
<p>But because COVID's a boogeyman and people are none-the-wiser they can argue that it's not that simple due to transmission, etc. via fearmongering.</p>
