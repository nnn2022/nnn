<p>People are ego driven liars. You think we are mean horrible assholes now, people used to do human sacrifice, and yes guys, ALL COLORS AND CREEDS DID IT.</p>
<p>People are evil and that is why the bible came into popularity, because it made the average human in check, somewhat. I am not a bible thumper and I am not onboard with the whole "JESUS WILL SAVE US" type deal.</p>
<p>If you study history you can learn a lot. People that think we are the BEES FREAKING KNEES right now because of computers and teslas driving around. I beg to differ. When people stray from the 10 commandments, we are fucked. </p>

        <p>Not sure about the battle between good and evil but my girlfriend works at a major hospital and she said the June  July shortage of beds was due to one thing. The higher ups cane down and told them any patient that tested positive for Corona had to be quarantined for 2 weeks before they could be let out. Even if they had no symptoms. So basically there were entire wards of people that were perfectly healthy that were stuck there filling beds for no reason whilst people with real emergency conditions were stuck in the hallways waiting for rooms to open up. She 7sed yo come home crying at night because she'd on one hand be dealing with a person sick of being in quarantine when they weren't sick and took it out on her and trying to console the person with heart failure waiting to get a room as they slowly die out in the hallway. It was messed up man.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I can’t get behind this ‘average person is evil, we are kept in check” nonsense. It was the elites in those ancient societies that forced the everyday person to engage in sacrifice and normalize it. If you think that shit is normal, you’re an idiot. We are the same as humans back then, which stands to reason sacrifice came about via elites becoming untouchable via acquiring mass amounts of power and becoming untouchable. </p>
<p>You are just spewing elite propaganda at another level. </p>
<p>The elite‘a are the evil ones. Everyday people that do this shit have been exploited via their fear response. They aren’t evil, but they still aren’t our allies until they wake up, just like in the matrix.</p>

        <p>Theres decades worth of some of the most sophisticated philosophical reasoning on this topic and this guy comes in with a definitive answer, nice.
Edit: just because it pissed me off. Sacrifice was fucking normal and it’s basically the same motive we have for a lot of things today like voting and fighting for your country. It was an act of giving your most prized possession with no return as an act of faith. And no, there are not that many accounts of human sacrifice and most people back when it was happening would have disagreed. It was small tribes of people that never lasted</p>

        <p>We have no family that works in the hospital, but -   </p>
<p>My husband runs a hardwood flooring business and is in people's homes all the time.  As you might note, hardwood flooring is a completely cosmetic renovation.  It is not essential for health or safety, or habitability of a home. He has done tons of work over the past year and a half for nurses and doctors, many of whom tell him the hospitals are empty, and they are bored.  We live in Ontario, Canada, where our hospitals were allegedly so overrun that we are one of the last places in the world to lift some restrictions (I'm talking minor ones like sitting on a restaurant patio or buying a frying pan), and still retain many of them.  In addition, we live in a "hotspot" area, where we were held back from entering the initial "reopening" phase with the rest of the province.   Why would these medical professionals (a) tell him this if it weren't true; and (b) invite an unvaccinated stranger into their home for a completely cosmetic and unnecessary renovation, if their hospitals were filled with people dying of a "deadly virus"?  It doesn't add up.</p>

        <p>That's crazy I have several relatives who are nurses who have been working almost non-stop 12 hour/double shifts the last year.</p>
<p>Oh god why am I even commenting on this sub.</p>
<p>This is satire right? Like peak satire so dense and potent it passes over the head of even learned and lifelong students of the art, such as myself..,</p>

<p>All I can really say is, I have half-a-dozen nurses in my family just from the generation before mine. A couple more(retired obviously...) from generations previous.</p>
<p>I know their experience, and even though at-least ONE is a Q/anti-vax nut, even THAT person respects the power of vaccines and PPE.</p>
<p>I know my truth, and I live it. Y'all are living a lie just for the sake of your own comfort.</p>

        <p>I noticed this when it became “okay” for customers to wear no mask but service “had to” even if vaccinated. Plus people on TV don’t have to, but people working the cameras do. It’s all about showing who is in charge in a situation. Gross.</p>

<p>I bet there’s also significant overlap between Maskers and EnvironMENTALists, yet you hardly hear a peep about the streets and parking lots littered with masks lmao. Almost as if they don’t really care about the environment either…</p>

        <p>Indoctrination starting at the school level - no wonder the Department of Education has local schools relying on federal funding so the federal government can control the narrative... </p>
<p>This is EXACTLY how the 'science behind global warming works: </p>
<p>&rt;Pay the scientists to ONLY study ONE side of something (CO2=BAD) and report on NO OTHER OUTCOME except the narrative that's paid for (resulting in <em>massive new taxation and control schemes</em>).

<p>They don't necessarily have to be "in on it."</p>
<p>They are just going along with what they are told by their superiors.</p>
<p>I have a family member that's a nurse. Shes set to retire in the next 3 years. There's no way she's going to risk her career/pension/income to speak out.</p>
<p>It's the same with cops, I'm sure a lot of them opposed the lockdowns but aren't going to speak out in fear of losing their job/income.</p>

        <p>I do know that the virus is real because it swept through my family. It made me more sick than I have ever been. It is a pretty nasty virus for some. It also killed my Grandfather. 
The hospital I work at, was NEVER overrun. It is now short staffed, so probably feels “busy”, but definitely normal numbers. 
Hardly any of my daughter’s middle school 
friends have had Covid, only 1 that we know of.<br>
I will not get vaccinated because the risk of injury doesn’t outweigh the risk of the illness, especially with natural immunity. I have been exposed to Covid patients and coworkers several times since March 2020, I never got reinfected… but my fully vaccinated coworkers keep getting infected. So there’s that.</p>

        <p>They’ve been mentioning the number of hospital beds USA has. They forget to add in the numerous care home beds, general outpatient beds, doctors offices, hospice care, general home care available. Really, the number we should be worried about overwhelming is the amount of nurses and doctors available. Even if they ended up all being inaccessible, I’m sure there would be some sort of useful guidance that family and friends can utilize in order to save a loved one. Or even do to yourself. But no, the only repetitive message we get over and over again is “wash your hands and be a part of our experiment”. Hopefully they get their priorities straightened out soon.</p>

        <p>This is so true. If you go outside, you’d think there’s no more talk of a pandemic going on. The other day, I stepped into a store and saw CNN on the tv. Don Lemon was going on and on about the Delta variant, how dangerous it is and how certain communities are being inundated by it. Honestly, it sounded like <em>PURE propaganda</em> and fear mongering. I’m so glad I cut the 24/7 news cycle out of my life. It’s truly a cancer to the mind.</p>

        <p>I agree in general that we are doing too much with the propaganda on television.</p>
<p>But this post is silly. There is a pandemic. No doubt about it. It's pointless and idiot to deny it. It's counterproductive. There is an hospital close by my place and I can tell you the ambulance sirens last year was on every 20 min. To this day it's less since elders are vaccinated but from time to time we can still hear it.</p>

        <p>You need to look for the definition of "endemic":</p>
<p><em>"especially of a disease or a condition, regularly found and very common among a particular group or in a particular area: Malaria is endemic in many of the hotter regions of the world."</em> </p>
<p>Source : Cambridge dictionary</p>
<p>The Covid-19 isn't normally found or common. </p>

        <p>I don't know if you are dumb or if you just have bad faith.</p>
<p>Once again, read the definition and see the exemple I gave. Malaria is commonly and normally found in hot area as it comes from a mosquito. There's practically nothing that can be done to make it disappear. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Covid-19 came from an outbreak (most probably fabricated in a lab so it's artificial and has human intervention) and wasn't normally found in the world. </p>
<p>The fact that covid is here now doesn't make it common or normal. Unless it's the new normal that you want and are happy with.</p>

        <p>There you go. Then it's a new normal and you need to get used to it. Therefore, you have nothing to do in this sub ranting against the new imposed normal. If it's normally found, you must act accordingly and wear a mask, take a vaccine and take all the precautions.</p>

        <p>The virus is here now and probably will be forever like other coronavirus’s. It’s as scary as influenza and no more. The new normal is the worlds reaction to it and that is what I’m against. If you truly want to rid the world of covid start campaigning for worldwide ivermectin distribution as the evidence for that particular drug stopping transmission of covid is far more compelling than any vaccine.</p>

        <p>There was a fake fb post that showed basically no change between 2019 and 2020 death tolls late last year with supposed screenshots from the CDC. The 2019 stuff was accurate but the 2020 numbers had not been reported on CDC website at the time of the fake post. People believe what they want to believe so it of course has been a sticking point with conspiracy theorists. In reality there was a several hundred thousand death uptick in the US from 2019 to 2020 after being relatively flat for the past several years. 2.8m deaths in each 2017 2018 and 2019 and 3.3m in 2020.</p>

<p>To answer your short question, yes the CDC counts issued death certificates from every jurisdiction in the US each year.</p>

        <p>The CDC tracks deaths based on actual issued death certificates each year. At this time the provisional numbers are out as it takes a significant amount of time to not only collect the certs from every jurisdiction but also to verify cause of death for their other tracking metrics. They typically release the final numbers in Nov of the following year (so Nov 2021 we will have the final 2020 numbers). The provisional are typically directionally correct for overall totals as the death certs are mostly in but the causes are still being categorized. For 2020 we had a 15.9% increase after having a &lt;1% increase each of the previous 3 years. 
 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e1.htm</p>
<p>From their website the count from 2020 is over 3.3m</p>
<p>As for the fake post I was partly incorrect. The post used data from the CDC website, but it had a disclaimer that it was only partial data from Feb1-Nov 16 of 2020 and the person then extrapolated their own "2020 total" in their claim while going against the CDCs projections at the time. </p>

        <p>No problem, I'm glad I could help!</p>
<p>I think part of the issue is we hear the word "estimated" all during the year and then for 11 months of the next year. We are all skeptical of that word (for mostly good reasons) but not all estimates are created equally or mean the same thing. The CDC has been working to provide nearly live updates to their death total metrics as certified deaths are submitted to them but a lot of jurisdictions do monthly or even quarterly updates which makes that more difficult and a lot of people balk when they suddenly see a large uptick every few months without thinking about why that might occur.</p>

        <p>I’m usually for all this, but Im a nurse and worked in the covid unit and it was hell on earth. I’ve never seen so many deaths and there was nothing we could do. Trust me, the evidence is there. I don’t agree with everything that has happened like shutting down businesses and everything, but this virus has been hell for people in healthcare.</p>

<p>If you can't look outside of your window and see signs of a pandemic, I'm sorry. I'm not sure where you got the expectation that that would be a thing. From a movie or TV show maybe?</p>

        <p>Hi, Canadian here. Just letting you know this is happening everywhere in the world. ICUs are filling with people needing, you guessed it, intensive care. I know people who have gotten sick, but luckily were healthy and had their first dose. My friend’s elderly uncle, and a different friend’s comatose brother were not as lucky and were confirmed to have been killed by the covid-19 virus.</p>
<p>Not sure how privileged or ignorant one needs to be to not think this is real. Like why even, would all the governments in the world simultaneously lie about this? Stop denying clear facts. There are people dying, and your ignorance is literally leading to indrect deaths by allowing this disease to continue transmission.</p>

"Whats your proof for reality, except for the proof that we just dismiss, where's your proof?"    </p>
<p>Well, you're a pedophile. Where is xour proof that you arent? but not your lack of court documents that you havent been convicted. Not your lack of accusations from people around you, those are paid actors. Not your lack of child porn on your pc, that couldve been faked. So where's your proof that you're not a pedophile? </p>

        <p>Guys, I don’t agree with lockdowns and tracking but denying covid exists is completely wrong. </p>
<p>I genuinely did hear a lot of ambulances. Have family and friends who are nurses and doctors in the NHS and they have consistently told us about the situation. 
Even the doctor friend who is herself anti lockdown acknowledges it is very tough in hospitals. She even discussed that before England went in to lockdown.</p>

        <p>Any excess deaths here in the US can be explained by the proportionally larger boomer generation being hit harder (95% survival oh my) and dieing at the average age of death. Its not a tragedy but it is an easily manipulated statistic.</p>

        <p>Have you considered baby boomers are called baby boomers for a reason? And they’re in the age range to be hit especially hard by a respiratory illness. Doesn’t it make sense that as they start reaching dying age, we’re going to see an increase in total deaths? And that’s kind of happening right now? Is it a coincidence that nearly all COVID deaths were boomers?</p>
<p>To me, we should be expecting an uptick in total deaths even without any “pandemics” for this reason alone. Unless I’m missing something..</p>

        <p>No, people literally say it’s the flu and not a different virus. Which is wrong. Stop apologising for them. This only discredits our cause. If you see someone saying it’s not real, please explain to them that it is very much real, but overblown. Accepting such behaviour only hurts us in the long run, because people will simply point to them and consider we’re all the same.</p>

<p>All I said is if a person did not watch TV or listen all the hysteria could they distinguish it from the flu within themselves? If not, why are they wrong to call it the flu? Some people only believe what they or their close community experiences first hand. </p>

        <p>Of course you hide behind freedom of expression, which I didn’t doubt for a second. But an informed opinion is preferable to an opinion based on CNN or NNN. Indoctrination apparently happens on both sides and both consider themselves to be critical thinkers, when most are not. If you consider explaining the existence of a new coronavirus to be a waste of time, I’m pretty sure you’re not interested in a true world but rather in a world where your opinion is prevalent. Replacing one dictatorship with another was never the answer as it only creates more problems and radicalises people. Anyway, take care of yourself and have a great day or night.</p>

<p>A true world to me is simply a world without any form of censorship of information, that is both simple and <em>in my opinion</em> as true as we're ever going to get.</p>

        <p>The narrative is not real.</p>
<p>If you have to get tested to find out whether or not you have a supposed extremely deadly and contagious pathogen then it isn't that deadly. </p>
<p>There are A LOT of things out there that can kill a person and I am aware of many. Many people ( myself included ) would know nothing about the existence of this virus if it wasn't broadcast on every TV channel, news source, business, event, etc. I live in a huge city too. </p>
<p>At least admit to yourself that something isn't right about all this - don't let them turn you against your neighbors, friends, and family.</p>

        <p>...You are overdosing on the Us vs Them mentality. Never said I believe any of the narrative, I literally said it is bound to have a <strong>low mortality rate</strong>, yet you found a need to stress this twtice as if I was opposing that.<br>
There is no ominous "them" name the people and corporations that push this instead of simplifying your world view on the good and enlightened deniers and the sheeple. <br>
The claim in the post is just ridiculous, and denying the existence of the pandemic is exactly why people think of the sceptics as tinfoil-hat-wearing retards.</p>

        <p>I didn't realize there were people that still denied covid existed. That's wild. So all of the countries in the world are lying to us? All of them are faking thousands of deaths. They all destroyed their economies to push the American governments agenda? Is that what you think? How arrogant do you have to be?</p>

        <p>How does this even remotely prove that covid isn't real? All this does is explain some really basic psychology about fear. People are scared. Shocking. Scared of what? A real virus. What's your point?</p>

        <p>There are plenty of viruses and other diseases out there with over 99.8% survival rate. Should we close down our economy and society for them too? If you die and had COVID within two weeks it is considered a "covid death", you don't find that alarming? </p>

        <p>Oh yes, there are lots of ignorant people who believe that and it's scary. Like Qanon supporters and those who aren't necessarily Q supporters, but have very similar beliefs. Not only Americans have fallen for these conspiracy theories, but Qanon has infected others across the world with their theories as well. My mom is one of these Q people, and I have to listen to her nonsense about covid every day.</p>
