        <p>Just gonna take this from a different angle. Their stocks are probably up because people are scared and thus buying more insurance and I assume insurance companies will have raised prices for new customers to capitalise on this shit. Not to mention stock prices are always a mess and never really representative of how well a company is doing.</p>

        <p>The real reason is that virtually every stock has gone up this year. Thatâ€™s cause the fed made it clear none of these companies would go out of business. The Us treasury was buying corporate bonds for god sakes- something they have NEVER done before. Itâ€™s just asset inflation. People who owned stocks got a lot richer this year. People who didnâ€™t got F-ed. </p>
<p>The other part of this is that health insurance companies were able to drastically cut costs this year. Think about how many people werenâ€™t able to get routine surgeries. Meanwhile, their revenues barely changed, since people still need health insurance.</p>
