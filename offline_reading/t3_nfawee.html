        <p>I have a metabolic disorder that doctors recommended that I get regular flu shots every year because I got really sick once.  I live in Canada which already has mandatory mask requirements to use stores. I am an open mind but I also don’t want to unnecessarily gamble with my health. I want to believe that this vaccine is safe in my heart. I want to be proved wrong with all this conspiracy stuff. I normally think conspiracy theories are fun things to read and think about as hypotheticals. </p>
<p>What I don’t like is the coercion and how many people are brainwashed into shaming others who don’t have the same opinions. I believe we are being divided by design especially over the last few years. The unvaccinated will be the new enemy. The way people react to unvaccinated being abused is shocking. It reminds me of the Five Minutes of Hate or however it was in <em>1984</em>.  I don’t like the leaked email from Canada that apparently describes the last year and all of this one to a decent amount of prophecy. I don’t like how doctors who aren’t big pharmaceutical or government workers are not being heard and given the fair coverage if they disagree with the narrative. I don’t like how disturbingly close we are to possibly totalitarianism and one world government.</p>

        <p>I completely agree. </p>
<p>No one is taking a step back and really thinking about their situation. I too suffer from not the best health. I live in Ontario Canada. Lockdowns and regulations are pretty strict in my environment... irrationally so. </p>
<p>I’ve seen so much hypocrisy that once it’s brought up it is deemed not altruistic or I have some sort of cognitive dissonance when it comes to the sanctity of life. </p>
<p>Yet here we are living in one of the safest regions of the planet. I have everything, a job, cheap house hold products, a surplus in food selection, TVs and electronic gadgets all affordable to me through the expense and exploitation of the world around me. </p>
<p>If life is priceless. Then we know all the resources, the ads, the infastructure built into helping fight the covid pandemic could’ve been used in decades past to combat heart disease, diabetes, and other reversible health problems that plague western cultures.  </p>
<p>It’s like we only pick when we should be altruists. </p>
<p>If we are born into a culture that bombards and promotes a capitalist agenda (cheap, processed high sugar foods) we become reliant on a healthcare system to mend those enforced and promoted bad habits. It’s a perpetual system where the healthcare system benefits off the unhealthy life styles of their populace. </p>
<p>The failure to recognize this truism is the driving factor why I don’t believe the ballyhoo regarding altruism for those at risk to COVID.</p>
