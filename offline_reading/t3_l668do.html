        <p>This morning I posted in r/CovIdiots a link to a recent scientific paper which proves that restrictive measures like lockdowns, confinements, mask mandates, etc. are not effective to fight the spread of the controllavirus. There were two debates in the comments and in one of them this happened.</p>
<p>He started a debate and he was trying devalue the scientific paper (typical expert), so he was doing abstract critics against it, just to say something, because the study is pretty solid comparing countries which implemented restrictions against countries which didn't (like S. Korea and Sweden), and the comparison didn't produce any significant result.</p>
<p>In order to dismiss the paper, <strong>he ended up saying that it is impossible to run scientific experiments to find out which restrictive measures work or not. So, he is basically saying that the decisions to implement lockdowns and mask mandates are not based on scientific studies or results, because for him those are impossible to obtain</strong>. üòÆüòÆ</p>
<p>He is actually wrong on that, as you can easily prove through the scientific method (like the scientist who wrote the paper did) that these restrictions don't work. What you can't prove is that they work, because they actually don't work. But the value of what he says still remains: he thinks that the restrictive measures taken by governments are not based on science at all.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PD: I indicate that he is an Expert, because in the conversation he says that he is a <em>"physical scientist"</em> who dedicates to <em>"critically analyze academic papers and evaluate their rigor on a daily basis"</em>. So it comes from his own mouth.</p>

        <p>Well, no, that's not really how that works. The measures that have been implemented in various countries, like lockdowns, mask mandates and whatnot, have been based in science. Through various studies, past knowledge and conceptions, health advisors throughout the globe have almost unanimous agreed that the most effective way to mitigate the spread of the virus is to implement many of the measures that have been implemented.</p>
<p>The guy brought up that because you can't run a controlled trial on countries, there's way to many factors to extrapolate conclusions from. It seems like you linked a paper that did that - I don't know the paper that you linked, but provided that it does try to draw conclusions off of that, the guy's point is valid. </p>
<p>If you want an example, take Sweden - it's been lauded often for its relatively minimalist action towards the pandemic, and seemingly came out the better for it. That doesn't mean, however, that Sweden's hands off approach is better, or that therefore, masks are useless or something, because there's so many variables to consider.</p>
<p>Maybe Sweden had a significantly lower population density than other countries, maybe Sweden's populace adhered to guidelines much more than other countries, maybe Swedish culture prioritizes cleanliness and hygienic measures more than other countries, point being, unless you're just comparing Sweden to Sweden, it's very difficult to make any conclusions off of something like that.</p>

        <p>Do you have those scientific papers which say how well massive lockdowns and mask mandates for the general public work?... If you do, show them and that's it. You don't need to write the Bible in reddit, specially if you don't have any scientific fact to back you your statements and you use words like "maybe", "think", and you make assumptions which make no sense. It's a waste of time to discuss things with science deniers like you man, but well, good try I guess. Kiss kiss.</p>

        <p>Yeah, sure. Here's a study that showcases that social distancing and lockdowns could be effective if applied to influenza: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372334/</p>
<p>It was created in 2006.</p>
<p>Here's a study that showcases the efficacy of facemasks: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20497389/</p>
<p>It was created in 2010.</p>
<p>Studies like this were used as a basis for the decisions made by governments - ergo, they were scientific decisions. Governments didn't just randomly decide that masks and lockdowns should be implemented, without any prior knowledge. </p>
<p>And u/PainCakesx , I'll respond to you here, since reddit delays you from making comments if you get downvoted,</p>
<p>Sure, that would be pretty decent evidence to showcase that current lockdown policies have been ineffective, but the point I've been making the whole time, is that that really isn't evidence that you can get without other factors influencing the results. Again, you can't compare New York with lockdowns, to New York without lockdowns. </p>
<p>Now obviously, there's ways to account for factors and biases like that, but then again, that's what the original guy said. The original comment that sparked this whole discussion was "It is never going to be easy to...", not that it couldn't be done.</p>
