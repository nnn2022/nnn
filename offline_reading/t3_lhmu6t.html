        <p>It's impossible to be libertarian anymore. You can't just be "left alone" in society.</p>
<p>You don't want to see your tax dollars wasted on the military industrial complex or failed social programs? Armed agents will be sent to throw you in prison.</p>
<p>You don't comply with rapidly changing, arbitrary gun laws from an overreaching government agency that lacks the authority to even make those laws? Armed agents will be sent to throw you in prison.</p>
<p>You don't want to deal with the endlessly moving goalposts for COVID-19 guidelines? You want your lifetime business to not go under due to useless lockdowns and government negligence? You will be fined and eventually, you will probably see armed agents sent to throw you in prison. Other countries are already doing this, and branch COVIDians support the idea.</p>
<p>On the contrary, you participate in several months of protests that consistently turn violent and result in burnt down businesses, injuries, and deaths? Nah you're good fam CNN said so. For an organization that calls themselves "Black Lives Matter" yet gives it's millions in donations to politicians instead of black people, let's not forget.  Also it's ok because these large maskless gatherings don't spread COVID, only Thanksgiving dinners and gyms.</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn't see the problems here needs to take their head out of the globalist's asses.</p>

        <p>&rt; You can't just be "left alone" in society.</p>
<p>I don't think they realize they monsters they are creating with how they treat this mindset too. They see these "left alone" people as push overs, but the more you push them over, the more bite they're going to have when they inevitably get sick of being pushed over. Most Americans fall into that category, and it gives people the illusion that we just don't care as a society and will follow whatever the "experts" say into an abyss of hell, but it's more so that Americans just have a lot of patience and most people don't like conflict. A lot of those people are realizing conflict is inevitable if they ever want their "left alone" lifystyle back. </p>
<p>I think this is going to inevitably lead to something no one on this board can even imagine once the pendulum starts swinging in the other direction.</p>

        <p>You hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the authoritarians are intentionally trying to push people over the edge. That way those people will lash out and the government can step back and say "See? We told you they were violent. They need to be restrained." Those who have been blindly following the narrative will agree, and we will start to see literal thoughtcrime punishments. People will be judged and profiled based on their political and cultural opinions, giving enforcement agencies the ability to punish those people before they even act "for the safety of everyone." </p>
<p>They called us crazy years ago for suggesting the Great Reset, now it's literally being shoved down our throats. World leaders are pushing for it and the media is promoting the ideas behind it. It's up to the people now to make sure it doesn't go their way. Because if they get the authoritarian society they dream of, the people will be completely powerless to stop it. Wake as many people up as you can. A lot of people won't listen, even after being proven wrong. But this last year has been the turning point for many more.</p>

        <p>I have a pretty good imagination...I'm a pacifist, so I certainly don't want to see any violence, but there are too many worrisome long-term trends: Concentration of Wealth; Guns/Capita; Failed Democracy (which was inevitable); Political Division; Ethnic Division; Significant Drug Use; Large Land Area...</p>

        <p>Makes it inevitable, doesn't it? It's gotten to the point for me, a typical pacifist, where I want these people to be berated so deeply, so far into this heads, that maybe there will be one less of them the next day, for what they've done to society. I want these people to suffer, I want them to wish it was Covid. These people have destroyed what last redeemable qualities of society we had, and they should pay. They're not heroes, they're locusts, who have completely exasperated every single thing you listed. Bring on the pesticide because I don't give a fuck anymore.</p>

        <p>You are doing exactly what their ideology has perfected: Playing the Victim.  That means it's time for a strategic withdrawal.  I'm preparing to go to Tanzania to do non-profit work.  Every time I find my mind getting too dark, I think about all the wonderful children of the world who need me to be strong for them, need me to be peaceful and wise for them, and need me to invest my resources to help them tap into their true potential.  I despise the facemaskers, but I also have perspective and realize that it's a privilege to have won the birth lottery.  I almost tripled my money in the stock market last year.  The facemaskers are fithy rich, cowardly, and completely predictable.  If you're competent, you should be able to make easy money off of them.  If you can't make money from them, then maybe you should do some internal reflection.</p>

        <p>How hard is it to throw a piece of cloth over your nose and mouth? I’m just curious, is it an allergen/irritant thing? Like, if I knew I’d get fined for not wearing a mask in an area, I’d either wear a mask or go somewhere else that doesn’t care. What’s the point of knowingly being a dick about something you know you’d get fined for? I’m just curious what the expectation is going into a situation like that</p>

        <p>My body my choice. If you are scared of covid, you can wear the protection you desire, up to and including an N95 and goggles, or a hazmat suit. At no point is anyone else responsible for your safety when you can entirely take it into your own hands.</p>

        <p>Cool, I completely respect that. I 100% agree that <em>you</em> deserve the final say in what you chose to wear. I don’t intend to argue that. </p>
<p>The reason for my question though is that I think that sentiment applies to the people who run the university too. Too me, it’s their campus, if they don’t want people on their campus without masks, I think that’s 100% their call to do. Like, if I pay to go to a university and learn, I agree to learn on their terms. It’s why I can’t just do whatever I want when I’m at a library or in class. Personally, I think that’s fair. If they implement a mask policy, and you chose to disrespect that, that’s <em>your</em> choice, and I think it’s well within their right to enforce it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, fair enough. But nothing’s <em>forcing</em> you to go there with a mask. You could stay home or go somewhere that doesn’t care and is happy to accept you. But if you want to enjoy the benefits that come from something as big as a university, I think it’s reasonable for them to ask you to compromise with something as small as that.</p>

        <p>Is the mask compliance actually in the student code of conduct? If not, take it straight to the dean of students. </p>

        <p>I know the feeling. Somebody anonymously reported me at my school for walking alone outside without a mask on. Universities are hotbeds for antisocial authoritarians basking in their petty tyranny.</p>

        <p>What? So let me get this straight, you live in some sort of halls/shared accommodation? Did other people complain? Like how did they know? </p>
<p>That’s some serious bullshit man and i say you should try and fight it a little, no harm in trying. Might get a little money off it or something. How much is the fine?</p>

        <p>Bureaucracies almost always have an appeal system.  If you tirelessly argue your case, they might just drop it (obese cubicle workers get tired and out of breath very easily).  There is a preponderance of evidence that indicates face masks are not effective, if they are not effective, the guidelines are not reasonable.  You're in college to learn; learning about how the system is fixed is part of it, so too is learning how to game the system.  Good Luck.</p>
