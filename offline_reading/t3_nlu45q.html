    <strong>Is there any way around travel restrictions such as ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù pay for covid tests and quarantines? This system doesn‚Äôt protect anyone, it just makes money</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I‚Äôm so tired of everything. I really am. It‚Äôs clear the system is working in favour of rich and has nothing to do with keeping anybody safe. </p>
<p>I need to go from the uk to NYC due to personal reasons, it‚Äôs not a leisure travel. But because of British rules seems like I have to pay around ¬£300 ONLY for tests?? </p>
<p>First of all, I can‚Äôt provide at the airport a free NHS  negative test for ‚Äúunknown‚Äù reason. Does anyone know if they have a right to refuse me a right to board if I came with a free test? </p>
<p>Then I must have a quarantine in New York. But I‚Äôm coming only for 10 days and have to fill paperwork. I have problems with my residency and have to go to the offices. I work in retail and no one would ever give me 1 month of holiday to get enough time for all quarantines. </p>
<p>Then I have to pay for covid test to the uk again. And then pay for 2 more while quarantining. And then quarantine, while I should go back to work to you know make money to live </p>
<p>I literally cannot afford it. I‚Äôm so exhausted. Please can someone share their experiences and advice me any way? Other subs will eat me alive for all those questions</p></p>

        <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I'm an American so I'm not intimately familiar with your situation, but I'd say if you just get one test and use that for everything, they'll let you do it. They're getting paid minimum wage, they don't care enough to stop you because the date is behind.</p>

        <p>Yeah, for specifics you might have to talk to a New York local. I know all the rules are so annoying, but just keep your chin up.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm Canadian so can only speak from what I‚Äôve experienced. When I came back from Europe last September there was already in place the ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù quarantine for 2 weeks. I never quarantined, never got a phone call or anything for that matter. </p>
<p>So when it comes to ‚Äúhaving‚Äù to quarantine once you‚Äôre in NY I say f*ck it and don‚Äôt do it. Regarding the tests I wouldn‚Äôt know how to advise you, hopefully someone else can chime in</p>
