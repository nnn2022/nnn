    <strong>NoNewNormal - Common Questions, Answers &amp; Responses Thread (Research Period)</strong>
    <p><p>I've been thinking of putting together a basic FAQ and response thread so that we can easily find information on the most common themes we see coming through.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that we can work together to build this up with articles and information to back up our claims in an easy to digest way and to make it as comprehensive as possible.</p>
<p>I've numbered them for ease and would love if anyone can either add, provide better wording or even more reliable sources.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q1 - Is Covid very deadly?</p>
<p>A1 - Covid has a 98% recovery rate and only 2% of people who catch it have died from it so no (Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus)</p>
<hr>
<p>Q2 - Will Covid make you very ill?</p>
<p>A2 - Only if you are generally at risk because of auto-immune diseases for example or are very elderly. </p>
<p>Out of all the current cases, 99.4% only have mild symptoms and 0.6% are in a serious or critical state.</p>
<p>(Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus)</p>
<hr>
<p>Q3 - Why won't you get the vaccine, don't you care about the 2% that will die.</p>
<p>A3 - Yes I care, however the people at risk have already been vaccinated as a matter of urgency because the risk from covid is greater than the risk from the vaccine.</p>
<p>The ones at risk now have a high immunity because of this, which is evident because although cases are rising, the percentage of deaths remain low.</p>
<p>(Source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus)</p>
<hr>
<p>Q4 - Do we have a moral obligation to get the Covid vaccine.</p>
<p>A4: No we don't. The same as how people don't have a moral obligation to stop eating fast food, stop smoking tobacco products or stop drinking alcohol, which cause far more deaths from cancer than Covid does.</p>
<p>(Source: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics)</p>
<hr>
<p>Q5: Is the Covid vaccination safe?</p>
<p>A5: As only a small number of people have been vaccinated, no one really knows however there have been reports of deaths and serious injury caused by the vaccine on social media and in the press.</p>
<p>(Sources vary as YouTube takes down videos and social media removes posts when people have shown this)</p>
<hr>
<p>Some other themes we need details on -</p>
<ol>
<li>Vaccine/pharmaceutical companies Being fined for misleading the public about trials.</li>
<li>Evidence showing countries/states/towns etc that haven't had mask mandates or had the vaccine and stil had low cases and deaths</li>
<li>Evidence showing that the government has lied or misled the public about Covid.</li>
</ol></p>

        <p><strong>1</strong> the numbers are junk</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> the numbers are junk</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> your question is like one of those bad surveys with leading questions. After presenting point 1 and 2, point 3 is not truthful</p>
<p>Are you worried about the number of young people without jobs?</p>
<p>Are you worried about the rise in crime among teenagers?</p>
<p>Do you think there is lack of discipline in our comprehensive schools?</p>
<p>Do you think young people welcome some authority and leadership in 
their lives?</p>
<p>Do you think they‚Äôll respond to a challenge?</p>
<p>Would you be in favour of reintroducing Conscription?‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>contrast that with:</strong></p>
<p>Are you worried about the danger of war?</p>
<p>Are you worried about the growth of armaments?</p>
<p>Do you think there‚Äôs a danger in giving young people guns and teaching them how to kill?</p>
<p>Do you think it‚Äôs wrong to force people to take up arms against their will?</p>
<p>Would you oppose the reintroduction of Conscription?</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> the moral obligation is not yours - the moral obligation is for the government to present accurate data.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> - no - its not safe - the data supports this</p>
