    <strong>Been sneezing badly out of nowhere after my mother gotten her jab couple weeks ago.</strong>
    <p><p>I never had allergy problems and im very healthy no health problems. Rarely ever sneezed. Now after my mother got the vaccine and my father like 3 weeks ago, i noticed ive been sneezing ever since badly. I atleast sneeze couple times a day and when i sneeze it really hurts my lungs. I can feel it congesting up in the lungs. I personally will not be getting these vaccines because i dont believe with my own eyes with what im seeing vs what they are telling me. Parents dismiss whatever i say and they even said themselfs that they just ignore what i say about covid and the vaccines. Has anyone else had problems with sneezing after someone near you gotten the vaccine? I find it REALLY odd. Again never had any allergies that i know of, and have been really healthy my whole life.</p></p>
