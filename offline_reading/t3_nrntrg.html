        <p>Yeah itâ€™s a bit much logic for them</p>
<p>According to them an investigation into a demonstration that killed 1 person (a Trump supporter) is more important than an investigation into a pandemic that killed millions</p>

        <p>Exactly. People need to wake up and see the CCP for the threat that it truly is before it's too late.</p>

        <p>Um Trump never fired Fauci or had him arrested, that tells me all I need to know about him. You need to get out of the two party paradigm. Your government whether conservative or liberal has never had good intentions toward it's own citizens or other countries. Banks and corporations run things the government is the front. Keep believing in a political savior and you will continue to be disappointed. Believing in boogymen (CCP, ISIS etc.) keeps you distracted from the bad actors in your neck of the woods (and no I don't mean the democrats). </p>
<p>All our freedoms were suspended under Republican administrations. Bush signed the Patriot Act into law. If he hadn't of done that none of this would be possible. All democrats do is carry the torch down the road. Obama signed the NDAA which is the Patriot Act on steroids. There are no good guys in politics. Trump allowed lockdowns even though they are grossly unconstitutional. Every single politician that was in office when the lockdowns were initiated are guilty of treason and should be executed by firing squad. After that we can prosecute Obama and Bush and Clinton while they're still alive since they're guilty of the same just to a lesser extent....</p>

        <p>I definitely agree with the unconstitutionality of lockdowns, and perhaps we should look into those who are in power but firing squad is taking it too far.</p>
