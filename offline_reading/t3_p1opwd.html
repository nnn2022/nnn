    <strong>Stop pretending that you're powerless.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not a big poster, I used to be before my old account got shadow banned. Now I just lurk. The main thing I've been seeing lately is people acting like they are just powerless to all this and they're just complaining instead of making a real stand. It doesn't have to be major, you don't have to make an ass out of yourself but you have to make a stand otherwise you might as well be pro-forced vax. For instance, I don't even take a mask with me into public anymore, if a business wants me to wear a mask, I just leave. No fuss or arguments, just leave. This obviously isn't detrimental to large businesses but small ones will take note of this and will think hard about enforcing this every time someone turns around and leaves. Servers will start to wonder how many tips they're missing out on by turning away mask-less people. These people only understand money and this wont change if you just keep paying these people who hate you. It's so simple that I almost feel stupid saying it. But it's pretty obvious that some of you don't get it. Or you're more interested in maintaining your lifestyle  than actually standing up for what you claim to believe in.</p></p>

        <p>I always find it somewhat ironic that the same people who will fight for business's rights are the people being turned away while those same businesses cater to people who will snitch on them at a moment's notice for "non compliance".  Backwards reality is where we are heading.</p>

        <p>I’ve been slowly doing this. I live in a small liberal town. Not many places I can go maskless. And it’s hard to get over the fear of how it feels going against the grain. 
The only pathology is Victim hood. Don’t be a victim stand up for what you believe in. 
People what to blame big corporations for everything that’s wrong with the world but they are our shadow self. If we didn’t “need them” we would stop using them. People don’t think they have the power to stop ordering from Amazon and shop local but you do. 
I think the best example is “gluten free” products. No one had ever heard of gluten-free. And all of a sudden ppl where wanting and needing it. And the corporations provided, it was everywhere. Because the ppl wanted it. And they need your money just like you said.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing this.</p>
<p>If I see you without a mask in public, I find it very encouraging and my heart feels a bit warmer. There's many of "you", I have to mention.</p>
<p>I know it's been a hard year for everyone, but we are really the majority and we should eventually win. The weak position is demotivating for others and toxic. I believe that at least some of the people posting the "depressed vibe" are actually sabotaging the community.</p>

        <p>Well congrats but I guess the point I’m making is it’s easy to hold out and fight the system when your holding out only effects you. If you had someone to feed, house, and clothe then maybe you’d question when to stop holding the line. Do I wait till we lose my job or house? Or do I hold out until one of my kids die from starvation? Do you not pay your own bills or buy your own food?</p>

        <p>I do. I wear a mask at work. It's the only compromise I make. But I get groceries at target and don't wear a mask. I go to the gym without a mask. Me and friends go out to eat every Friday without masks. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. Small stands are better than no stands.</p>
