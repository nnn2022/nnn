    <strong>The Main Corona Sub</strong>
    <p><p>I just went to the main corona sub and scanned the top posts. I haven't really seen mainstream media often this year because I blocked it all out, I cringe when I see it. Can someone explain exactly what is going on over there? It looks like blatant sensationalism that you'd think every doomer would see though, but they eat it up and crave more. </p>
<p>Also, I'm not some guy in the woods that has been hidden from the virus. I'm in NYC and when all the hyped news was going centered on us I never noticed any chaos here. Myself and everyone I know were a bit sick last December and January but that was it. Nobody knew what it was back then, but there absolutely nothing of note to write home about. </p>
<p>Is anyone else not acclimated to regular news anymore and find it jarring?</p>
<p>Am I a conspiracy theorist for even telling you this?</p></p>

        <p>No. You're doing a very healthy and logical thing. You're recognizing that your everyday reality and situations are not what a monopolized doctrine tells you it is.</p>
<p>You are being rational instead of superstitious. You recognize that no matter how often someone/everyone tells you that a black cat will cause your demise, your thousands of experiences will cats and latters and stepping on sidewalk cracks tells you that's bullshit.</p>

        <p>I have also gave up on all news, my wife is in the healthcare field and every hospital was laying off people left and right when the news was saying the hospitals were packed. It was a outright lying.</p>
<p>The more we starting watching the news, the more we noticed how much every news network was lying. That's when we have up, and we are much happier. If something big happens in the world one of our friends will let us know. Other than that we don't care what the news says at all. Ps we live in a big city also.</p>

        <p>That sun is pure Chinese propaganda. It is to keep others in fear. They ban you for any wrong think if it is good needs or alternative news of hope. Doomsday fear mongering is where they get their energy.</p>

        <p>This year I gave up on reading "news" articles out of boredom. I used to enjoy the comment sections but SURPRISE all "news" sites shut those down. The comment section used to helped me work out how much bs was in the article. This year I figured out really quick that the majority is fear mongering bullshit. Sometimes I get bored enough to scroll through fb news to laugh and if I see laughing or angry emojis, sometimes I seek out the comments. </p>
<p>Also I'm not seeing any of the danger I'm supposed to be seeing. We hit yellow then orange, but surprisingly we didn't shut down again. This is a rather large area, but everyone seems to know each other or know someone that knows someone and I haven't heard of lots of covid deaths or even hospitalizations. The way they talk, we should be dropping dead on the street. Someone's neighbor got really sick but recovered. Someone's older Uncle died but he was in very poor shape to begin with. I've called three states and a european country home. I've been military and married to military. I know hundreds upon hundreds of people who know hundreds and thousands of people. I'm not someone who's lived in my hometown my entire life and never left the state. And I am just not seeing the need to panic like we are.</p>

        <p>I mean, we shouldn't even be surprised.  Really, since Trump took office, but even well before then, the fascination with dark and macabre things in tv and media has really taken off.  Look at the stuff that gets viewed on Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and the news cycles from MSM.  Nothing but wall to wall crime documentaries, stories about serial killers, and a general theme of being overly serious and dark in all of it.  Comedy has all but disappeared.  Even before Trump, the witch hunts and admittedly true stories of abuse by guys like Weinstein and Lauer and Spacey and on and on.  </p>
<p>There is a fixation on the dark and doom.  The scandals and the tragedies.  News does their part, but Hollywood builds a huge foundation in it.  Doomers and generally depressed people latch onto it.  Reddit is covered up with it, as is Facebook and Twitter.  </p>
<p>And, I'd be remiss if I didn't add, that it doesn't do favors for caucasian males like me, and I assume, many of us here on this sub.  We are the ones most victimized in this year of 2020, despite all the Karen memes.  Trump didn't do us a lot of good in that regard, either.  </p>
<p>Oddly enough, they chose to elect Biden.  I have to assume they were really electing Harris, and we shall see if that pans out.</p>
