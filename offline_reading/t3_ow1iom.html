    <strong>The conclusion of make a wish</strong>
    <p><p>With make a wish being a front-page askreddit question right now, remember when the make a wish ceo went on twitter to say all critically ill kids need to take the experimental shot or no wish? </p>
<p>I looked it up and apparently he backpedaled on that, but i watched the video, and I think it was very clear what he meant. News is saying the video was edited to stop before he clarified that it was only large gatherings and traveling wishes, which is still bad but not AS bad. Anyone remember that, got a link to the original vid + the 'real' one?</p></p>

        <p>I remember looking into it as soon as I heard about it and it seemed exaggerated to me even then. What I saw was just, as you said, for large groups etc. And even then they weren't going to require documentation, just acknowledgement by the parents that they were expected to comply.</p>
