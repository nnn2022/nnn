    <strong>A perspective from someone living in a free, competently run country. It's like western governments and activists are desperately trying to make everyone think that the vaccine is not to be trusted.</strong>
    <p><p>Ever since the very start of the Wuhan virus, I have been struck by just how differently my country, Serbia, has treated the virus compared to western nations. Where you're being treated with derision, mockery and severe threats to your liberty, we are treated as adults who can make personal decisions.</p>
<p>For example, masks were never politicised. They never lied to us about their effectiveness, the narrative was the same from the beginning up to now. Thus, I wore a mask because I believed it worked - I did not need to be threatened into it. If I was threatened into it, or shamed into it, I would have taken a stand as you have, and I would have seen it as a symbol of obedience that your governments have turned it into in the west. The main thing I'm asking myself, and am now asking you, is... WHY? Why did they make masks a symbol of obedience? Why did they take something that was genuinely meant to help reduce the spread of a disease, and make it into something undesirable to use for any person with a developed moral compass? That they're evil is not in question, I think the whole world knows that western governments are run by diabolical people. But are they just THAT incompetent? Surely not, right? Surely they realise that, one day, their behaviour will be in history books as the "botched handling of the COVID19 virus", as an example that treating your population as children does not make them compliant, and treating them with respect does.</p>
<p>Then there's the lockdowns. Even the "experts" in the west know that mass lockdowns do nothing. Back when the virus started, and nobody know for certain just how lethal it was, our government implemented authoritarian measures that kind of make sense when you consider an unknown virus. They implemented a lockdown and they called for people to unite and to organise in a way that would minimise their exposure to others. For example, having one person buy groceries for many people at once. The government gave significant benefits to small businesses to help them stay open and helped them keep paying their employees if they couldn't pay them during the lockdowns. Instead of destroying small businesses to please their big business owners like your governments did, they helped them weather the storm that they created. But this strict lockdown did not last long. When we learned more about the virus, the lockdowns were lightened, and instead only applied to people over the age of 65. Instead of threats, the president came on national television and apologised profusely for having to do that, and expressing that they value their lives and want to protect them. Libertarians (I am one myself) will scoff at this as "daddy government", and sure, you're not wrong, but consider that in my country, we are not in a cold civil war. The libertarians and statists work together to come to a compromise because everyone loves the country and wants the best for it, and its people. We aren't at each others' throats like you in the west. When the infections and deaths went down, this lockdown was lifted, and people were unrestricted. Over the last year, they implemented micro-lockdowns that lasted only for a very short time, for a few days, over the weekend, etc. - and did what they could to reduce or eliminate the impact on small businesses.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about vaccines. My country imported literally every single major vaccine, including the one given to the CCP (the one that's an actual, dead-virus vaccine, honestly I'm starting to think that might be the best one, lmao). Before rolling out vaccinations, they gave over the vaccines to our own research institutes to check. Obviously this isn't a long-term study on the safety and effectiveness of it, but it is something - our own researchers did what they could before rolling it out. You filled out a form on a website, and you got invited to get vaccinated. People over 65 were given a significant advantage, they got the vaccine almost instantly, whereas the younger people had to wait for a month or so. My grandmother who is in her mid 90s got vaccinated with the Chinese weakened virus vaccine, and she has had no complications (though obviously someone else might). The rest of the family was not nearly as elderly and we decided to bide our time until long after long term effects have been studied. Our government strongly encourages vaccinations and tries its best to convince everyone to get vaccinated, but people who don't get vaccinated are not second class citizens. Our president called a vaccine passport "shameful" and called on the EU to stop it. The only "pressure" that the government has done to get people to vaccinate, was giving people like $40 if they take the vaccine. Considering what the west is doing, this isn't nearly as bad.</p>
<p>The funniest part of all of this? We're one of the most vaccinated countries, for better or for worse. The real question now, is WHY are western governments doing everything they can to make everyone think that the vaccine is basically poison? The way they're behaving, I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND why all of you have the opinions you do, I would too if I lived in the west.</p>
<p>I can't tell you exactly why they're doing what they're doing, but to me, it seems like they're trying to use the pandemic to consolidate power and create authoritarian states all over the western world, which is beyond evil when you consider that they're doing so at the expense of people's trust in doctors, in vaccines for a somewhat dangerous virus, and in science in general. They literally thought that gaining a little bit of power over others was more important than people's health and safety. And they (whenever I say they, it just means people in charge and/or with influence, such as the politicians, the prominent activists and the influential businessmen) KNEW that useful idiots would gobble up any excuse they can come up with and would support them, no matter what. The cowards, the pathetic individuals who have no internal dialogue of their own and no moral compass whatsoever - for them, it is enough to say that you're doing something for the Greater Good (TM), and they'll support it. So in a way, it is a genius way of consolidating power, using those kinds of people.</p>

        <p>I think you nailed it. </p>
<p>In the beginning of 2020 I had confidence in our medical institutions and believed what they were telling me. I wore the masks, I followed their advice, I saw the lockdowns as necessary etc. </p>
<p>Their behavior has destroyed my trust in them; unfortunately, beyond repair, I think. I’m from the Balkans, too, so you’ll understand me when I say that the inat has taken over. I’m losing my job over it and I have no back up plan.</p>

        <p>You wrote a lot and I didn’t read it all. But from what I did read, masks (in the way we are told to use them) provide no benefit and are actually harmful. Fauci himself wrote a paper on how they prolonged the 1920 “Spanish flu” pandemic. Bacterial pneumonia.</p>

        <p>The mechanisms through which we figure out what is true and what isn't are tainted, maybe even irrevocably (though I hope not). There are studies that show anything at this point, and you can never know which ones are legit without repeating it yourself and seeing the results.</p>
<p>I voted for the government that's currently in power and I trust my own nation's doctors are not nearly as corrupted as those in the west, so I'm leaning on the side of masks. It's still a personal choice, though, not one a government makes for you.</p>
<p>Plus the point of the post was sharing a perspective from a place that isn't on the brink of a civil war, where everything isn't politicised. I could be wrong, I don't think I am, but ultimately it's not the most relevant thing. Point is, the way my country did it exudes confidence, whereas the west exudes incredible insecurity in anything they do.</p>

        <p>The second study proved absolutely nothing. Literally 6 Facebook mom's sent used masks to a lab. That's not a controlled environment at all. Who's to say they didn't contaminate the mask themselves. </p>
<p>The first study has jack shit to do with covid. It showed that used mask had increased bacteria vs unused masks left in the operating room. The study didn't say that surgeons shouldn't wear masks during operations but they should change them. No shit Sherlock the mask is gonna have bacteria, it's right at your mouth when germs are.</p>

        <p>Great post. It is many different things. However in summary, we the people were simply too “busy” and “greedy” to pay attention while our leaders sold our inheritance to the highest bidder. Those bidders are globalist. These globalist include huge multinational companies, the CCP, Soros, and others. </p>
<p>This has been in the works for a long time now. People were distracted and taught to be self-absorbed narcissist. People in my country have become so absorbed with themselves that they can’t see outside of their own selves. This is why we have 30+ genders and sexual identities. Our culture has become a label society. Everyone everywhere has a label for everything. For example, so many people I encounter label themselves as ADHD or some other similar disorder. My rebuttal is always the same, “if everyone has it, then why is it labeled? If it is common, isn’t it just normal?” The labels serve two purposes to divide and to cause people to focus on the self. The goal is to destroy national identity and community. It is easier to conquer a people that are divided and self-absorbed. We are being conquered.</p>

        <p>You may or may not be right, and nobody is going to be convinced of either one because the mechanisms through which we figure out the truth, science, is currently (and has been for a while, outside of maybe physics and chemistry) tainted by bad actors.

        <p>I would be much happier to wear a mask, even today, if they were never mandated in the first place. But now that my state (PA) does not have a mask mandate anymore, merely a mask recommendation, I won't wear one, to assert that it is my right to not wear one.</p>

        <p>It's almost as if different kinds of masks can both (potentially) reduce the spread of disease, and also stop people from using their teeth to bite someone. Who could have known similar looking objects can have different purposes?</p>

        <p>It's almost as if certain masks have been proven to do nothing but let air out the sides and beneath the eyes and not stop micrometer sized particles. It's also as if symbolism exists</p>

        <p>America didn’t get to be the strongest country by ways of honesty. </p>
<p>America is probably the most corrupt country to exist in modern day. Their corruption isn’t in a direct form of communism or dictatorship. </p>
<p>Rather their corruption stems from “behind closed doors” America is good at masking the corruption they caused, then Publicly coming to the rescue with a solution.</p>
<p>America will always take advantage of all situations. Good and bad natural or manmade situations are always looked at advantageously. Never waste an opportunity to implement a specific agenda to best cater to your beliefs and more power, even at the expense of their own citizens. </p>
<p>Most are blinded by the direct involvement America has caused on its own soil. 9/11 brought the patriot act. CIA has more operations on our own soil then they do throughout the rest of the world. JFK assassination could of also been the work of the government. Regardless if it was or not, the political powers at hand will always use these times to advantageously adopt new rules to implement on citizens for the sake of our freedom. </p>
<p>They lead our country and citizens through fear. Words of seduction to the public. </p>
<p>Best way to enact new things is to do so with fear and hope. </p>
<p>Cause the fear, and promise the solution of hope and safety for trading in more freedoms.</p>
