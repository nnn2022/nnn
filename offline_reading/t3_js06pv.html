        <p>Watching this unfold is like watching society collectively shoot itself in the foot over and over again while wondering why the foot won't work anymore. Then they try to fix the problem by getting the foot removed and now can't function properly at all so they scapegoat everyone but themselves for what they did to themselves.</p>

<p>Nah there is a reason this is enforced. </p>
<p>I'm not responsible for getting this garbage imposed upon me and if you didn't demand it - you aren't either. (Though trying to put some megalomaniac in power to enforce things like that does count as "demanding it" in my book)</p>

<p>This is a sharp observation of them constantly shifting the goalpost/narrative. </p>
<p>They changed the name and main buzzwords too: </p>
<p>First it was "(novel) coronavirus" then "corona" then "covid". And accordingly of course "pandemic", "masks", "trying times", "new normal" and "quarantine". The main buzzword now is "lockdown" and "cases". </p>
<p>Too few buzzwords and narratives would get too many people too bored of it apparently after such a long time.</p>

        <p>The three biggest problems with the current situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking that "cases" actually mean anything        </li>
<li>Still thinking that asymptomatic transmission is a threat        </li>
<li>Stigmatizing people who test positive or get sick </li>
</ul>
<p>A more appropriate response would be:</p>
<p>Create a social safety net for vulnerable people (ie elderly, immunocompromised), encourage them to isolate and/or take precautions (ie N95 or other active filtering mask)</p>
<p>Test and isolate symptomatic people</p>
<p>Allow everyone else - healthy people and recovered people - to live life normally.</p>
<p>The fact that we have essentially shut down society over a respiratory virus that presents no symptoms in the statistical majority of people is absolutely insane.</p>

        <p>Yup we are witnessing "mass psychosis". Sobering when you see it for what it is. I never thought I'd see it on this scale in my lifetime.</p>
