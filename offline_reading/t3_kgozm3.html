    <strong>How much longer do you think this will go on until people finally say “this is ridiculous”?</strong>
    <p><p>It’s been damn near a year. </p>
<p>I was afraid of covid in the very beginning, as I’m sure many were. They told us “14 days to flatten the curve!” Every two weeks for a while, and I started to grow skeptical. </p>
<p>Do you guys remember then the CDC came out saying that if you protest lockdowns or masks, you’re spreading covid, but if you protest BLM, you’re safe and not spreading at all?</p>
<p>That was when I stopped giving a shit entirely. That was simply way too obvious that this “virus” is just being used to further an agenda. I already wasn’t sanitizing my hands all the time and I already rarely wore a mask at all leading up to that, but that just put the nail in the coffin. </p>
<p>Fast forward to now, the economy is in utter turmoil, we’ve had ongoing MoStLy PeAcEfUl PrOtEsTs that have destroyed the homes and lives of many, small businesses are getting erased, and the ones still running are getting fucked in the ass. Mass depression and suicide, domestic violence, severe mental health degradation from isolation, families starving from being out of work, and for what?</p>
<p>A virus that has a ~99.982 survival rate for virtually everyone below the average mortality age? To protect people who are already about to die from dying? I personally don’t believe that is the reason for any of this at all. </p>
<p>And now we have a vaccine that’s been rushed out in record time, that at least from my understanding, does virtually nothing in terms of protection and has a higher likelihood of side effects than the “disease” it’s supposed to protect you from. </p>
<p>I just don’t see people putting up with this for a whole lot longer. I go everywhere without a mask and no business seems to give a shit. The only time I’ve ever been asked to put it on was when I went to vote a few months ago. Even then they hardly cared at all. The worst reaction I’ve <em>ever</em> gotten to not wearing a mask is getting the stink eye from a Karen wearing 3 masks and a face shield. </p>
<p>I can’t help but feel like most people will stop giving a shit entirely over the next several months, and the only people who will still care about masks and lockdowns are the people who are glued to r/coronavirus stuck in a loop of scaring themselves shitless over a nothingburger. </p>
<p>“BuT WhAt aBoUt GrAndMa!?!?!?! Do YoU WaNt YoUr GrAnDmA To DiE!?!?!1!?”</p>
<p>My grandma had cancer and is immunocompromised. She got covid and survived. </p>
<p>“iF iT SavEs jUsT oNe LiFe iTs WoRtH iT”</p>
<p>Yeah, let’s completely obliterate the livelihoods people spent their lives building, let’s destroy the economy, let’s drive people into mass hysteria, destroy our communities, our homes, let’s send millions into poverty, and let’s crank up suicide and domestic abuse by placing everyone on house arrest because it might save a life. Let’s destroy (and in some cases, end) the lives of many to save the lives of (very) few. Let’s do so much damage to the economy that we’ll be trying to recover for potentially decades. Totally worth it guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!1!!!1!!!!!</p>
<p>“YoU aNti-mAsKeRs aRe BiOtErRoRiStS sPrEaDiNg a DeAdLy ViRuS!!!!”</p>
<p>The space between the threads of your dinky cloth mask are much larger than the covid-19 virus, a disease so deadly that you have to get tested to know if you had it at all. Let me explain how filters work: </p>
<p>Let’s say you have a filter who’s holes are 1mm in diameter. This filter will stop particles larger than 1mm from passing, and will allow particles smaller than 1mm to pass. Will this theoretical filter stop a 0.25mm particle from passing through? No it won’t, because the particle is much smaller than the hole. That said, if you’re wearing a cloth mask, you are no better than the scary evil BiOtErRoRiSt AnTi MaSkErS. If anything, you’re making yourself worse off by wearing it all day long, creating a nice dark, moist environment for mold and bacteria to thrive right under your nose. And inhaling mold spores all day long is much more harmful than the beer flu. </p>
<p>I’m pissed off, rant over, I hope either this dumb shit ends soon, and if not, I hope everyone wakes up and realizes how stupid and insane this covid nonsense is.</p></p>

        <p>I was at the grocery today- no mask, my kids no masks, we were in the self check out.  This complete freaked out person got the check out station next to us- brings his own wipes- sanitizes the ENTIRE station (shelf, scanner, screen, touch pad etc) then starts to check out his stuff- hummm you just walked through the grocery store with your cart and TOUCHED everything, wtf does wiping down the scanner do?  Puts his stuff in the plastic bags which are sitting out in the store air- puts the bags in the cart, touches the cart- pushes said cart out of the store.</p>
<p>Explain this nonsense to me.  That is alot of extra cleaning of the self scanner for NOTHING.  My kids are looking at me like WTF is that @sshole doing? And I really wish I could have a sip of the vodka.</p>
<p>FYI- no one asked about our masks  I went to the deli and ordered, walked the entire store, kids went to the bathroom etc.  not a single issue.</p>
<p>I will not be taking my own wipes to the store with me.  If you are that paranoid, just get a grip.  sheezez</p>

        <p>I saw a lady when I was doing an Instacart order who had a mask on and clear gloves and she was also very slowly making her way through a busy store. Someone that terrified should really be ordering delivery or asking someone (family member, neighbor, whoever) to get her groceries. My mom has also been yelled at in public by a masked and gloved woman who was crabbing at her for supposedly being in the wrong line waiting for an order. (And this was at a bakery, certainly “not essential” and the whackjob lady didn’t NEED to be there.) </p>
<p>Plus the gloves don’t do shit. Unless that lady had enough pairs of gloves in her purse to change them every time she touched something. My RN friend said people who wear them in public probably aren’t doing that LOL.</p>

<p>He may not care personally but if someone calls the snitch line to the state and says they are allowing the unmasked to workout, the gym could get shut down again.</p>

        <p>I remember early on into this, I was upset with people not wearing their masks in stores. I got over that pretty quickly and now I'm thanking people for not wearing them. They get standoffish at first, thinking I'm being a dick, but eventually get happy that they're being validated.</p>

        <p>Yeah the suicides worries me a lot. There’s already been a number of suicides this year because of it, if lockdowns really go on for 1-2 more years, that number will jump way up. </p>
<p>Humans are social creatures. We need eachother. You can’t just lock everyone up in a box and reduce their social life down to words and images on a screen, for potentially multiple years. that’ll drive people insane and then to suicidal depression</p>
<p>Edit: watch as they say they died of covid too</p>

        <p>I don't think it has anything to do with us being social creatures; this year simply presented a "game over" state for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Everyone's got that one uncle or aunt who never achieved financial stability and were always tight on money. This year has been exceptionally rough on them and at 55-60-65 years old, there's no hope in hell of them building a new life all over again. They might opt to instead pack it in early.</p>
<p>Not everyone's grandparents are still alive and kicking. In some cases, your grandpa or grandma might be the only one left on that side of the family. They have nobody around them their age to socialize with, and ofc are too old to start learning computers to entertain themselves or find a new hobby. They might opt to pack it in early too - "I was going to die in a few years anyways."</p>
<p>Then there's the mental illness side of things. There are people in their teens, 20's, and 30's who are quite simply, fucking crazy. They might be bipolar or schizo or borderline or whatever, and on top of already struggling with money and just <em>getting along with people</em>, now they have no way in hell of finding a job or any semblance of stability. What do you think these people are going to do?</p>
<p>My prediction is three.</p>

        <p>Not to say anything against your argument but I don't think you should disregard the social species argument either. Consider this insane experiment they did in 1944: they took newborns and raised them without social interaction. Sure, they gave them all the basic care they needed: food, changing of diapers, bathing and hygiene. But they didn't sing or talk to them nor did they hold them close or play games with them. After four months half of the babies were dead. They didn't die of some sickness or malnutrition. Now, of course we adults function a bit differently, but I still think it's a poignant example of how harmful social isolation can be.</p>

        <p>Honestly? When the media decides. I was in a shopping mall the other day returning an item. The Woman In front of me saw I stepped about an inch too close and despite both of us being masked she got really freaked out and said “6 feet please! 6 feet!”.</p>
<p>If the media can brainwash people to be so devoid of common sense (walking into a busy mall full of people but thinking 6 feet and a mask renders you immune) well.... then they can turn this whole thing around too. But they won’t.</p>
<p>So who really knows? On the other hand, how could a woman like that ever rejoin society? Do you know how many of these people are going to have PTSD.</p>

        <p>&rt; Do you know how many of these people are going to have PTSD?</p>
<p>Yeah no kidding. Back when this all started, a friend of mine started <em>constantly</em> reading about covid and how the cases are increasing. He would literally talk about it non-stop all day every day. Getting more and more freaked out. Then he started wearing like 3 masks at the same time, gloves, sanitizer spray, and would not leave the house without all 3 masks at least. </p>
<p>He started freaking out because of the state mandated lockdown and how it’s a misdemeanor to be outside and all that and he’d freak out whenever Id leave (we were roommates at the time) because he thought I’d get arrested. Tried to tell him none of the cops care and we just wave at eachother at most. </p>
<p>We tried to tell him he needs to stop reading about covid because he’s becoming extremely paranoid. Even then, he’s pretty tame compared to how absolutely terrified some people are. At this point I’m pretty convinced those people will continue to isolate themselves and wear 25 masks simultaneously long after covid is gone</p>

        <p>We had a similar thing happen at... wait for it... Universal Studios Florida in line for Harry Potter Hagrid ride. Old-ish man ahead of my family in line (probably 60). Long line. My daughter was chatting and stepped off her circle and the guy turns around and shouts: "GET BACK! I'M HIGH RISK!" (My daughter was nowhere near him.) My husband almost kicked his ass but I thought it was hilarious.</p>

        <p>Very astute point.</p>
<p>Some people still have the mindset of an eight year old, and are deathly afraid of <em>the prospect of</em> getting in trouble.</p>
<p>I had this conversation with my mum a few days back. She was horrified to learn I almost never wear my mask in stores. She started listing all of these wild scenarios, like "what if security confronts you? What if you get fined?"</p>
<p>I calmly explained that in a worst case scenario, I'd simply act aloof and say "oh silly me, I knew I was missing something" and pull a mask out of my pocket. What the fuck are these people going to do? Follow me to my car? Look me up on Facebook and see all of my anti-mask posts &amp; realize that I was probably putting on an act? Of course not.</p>
<p>My mom couldn't comprehend that you could diffuse a situation like that. The fact that security <em>might</em> approach you in the mall and <em>might</em> have a conversation with you was enough to set off her anxiety and think absolute worst case scenario with no in-between.</p>
<p>How many other people walk around like this?</p>

        <p>many women are like this, probably all the people raised by single mothers has not helped in this regard either, my mum is similarly scared of confrontation in general (she knows covid is a scam though) but my dad could care less and is not scared of confrontation at all.
they are both in their late 50s.</p>

        <p>This actually happened to me the other day completely by accident. I walked onto the subway before I had my coffee and totally forgot about the stupid mask. My brain just autopiloted me to the traincar without thinking.</p>

        <p>So they put a curfew in place here and I was in the car with my friend close to the curfew time and I told him what to say if he gets pulled over I said shit you know I'll give the cops a fucking piece of my mind if I'm pulled over. I have absolutely zero tolerance. I do not wear a mask and I realized a free human being doesn't fear getting in trouble. I want to be like our forefathers who took a stand. I want to be like some of my ancestors who survived the holocaust. I don't want to be a scared little sheep. I will fight wherever I go. Time for everyone to speak up and stop being scared.</p>

        <p>I think a large subset of the population is actually ENJOYING this drama, if you can believe that. Its allowing them to experience something totally outside the drudgery of their ordinary lives.  Its kinda like watching a suspense or horror film where you feel stressed or scared but aren't really in danger....I think there's a lot of people mistakenly feeling this way, like they are watching a movie, and in the end, it'll be a big ole happy ending.<br>
IMO, they won't wake up until they personally feel the repercussions of the lockdowns in some way and realize this isn't a fucking movie with a fairy tale ending.</p>

        <p>I think that the vaccine not exempting you from masks and distancing requirements is a redpill for many.  So many people told themselves that they just have to comply until the vaccine comes out,  then they'd get their normal lives back.  </p>
<p>Being told "after you get it you still need a mask" will push many of these reluctant compliers into full disobedience..... i hope.</p>

<p>They are are accepting this.

They are still paranoid.
They are still being very CaUtIOus being a “high risk group” for —inset reason here—</p>
<p>They refuse to listen to me when I say I say “It’s just a god damn flu!”
Actually I am expected to not really talk about this with the others.

        <p>It was already ridiculous when they got to make lockdowns because of a virus with a 3% mortality rate.</p>
<p>They can use any excuses to force people now. They can always claim there might be a new unknown virus around, so we'll have to wear masks forever "just in case".</p>

        <p>If it had a 3% mortality rate I'd be afraid too. That's a lot. Luckily, we are blessed with something far less dangerous. Somewhere around 0.23% all over, and that's counting everyone who died "with" covid too.   </p>

        <p>Until a new cause they can support comes to Facebook and they can change their profile photo frames and latch on to a new form of hysteria about something. Right now COVID gets all the attention and emotion because of “300,000 dead” “crying, tired nurses” and “overwhelmed hospitals” that make people hop on the feel good bandwagon. And now the vaccines are out and healthcare workers are getting more applause because they got the shot, so the public can’t wait to follow that trend either and show off their bandages and masked vaccine selfies. </p>
<p>I see people in my life just overly willing to go along with more and more rules. Even the people I thought were smart and well educated just follow whatever they hear on CNN and immediately fall into line with the governor’s orders. They don’t want to think and they don’t want disagreement. You try to disagree with these people and they shun you. It’s all about their imagined “hero” status and how Biden will save them.</p>

        <p>I thought that way back in July. But no, everyone is still on the bandwagon, and even those who don’t buy all the hype are still obeying. There’s also the problem of Stockholm syndrome. The longer all this goes on the more people will be succumbing to that.</p>

        <p>Even in my most compliant state I'm verrry slloowwlly seeing more people putting their foot down and "no, this is completely batshit insane and we're not doing it anymore". It's still gonna be a slow process in many areas though as more people finally wake up and smell the coffee realizing they've been had and there was never a pandemic at all. This certainly created a new breed of germophobes on steroids though to laugh at in the hopefully near future. It's a little brighter of a sign to see that all the stores that are enforcing the mandates save for places people need to go whether they like it or not like the bank, post office, ect- that are obviously going to be up tight about it are having very empty looking parking lots all day now. Best lay off dictating what people do with their bodies and mind your own business else they want to lose even more money and customers.</p>

        <p>It’s so refreshing to read this, a voice of sanity. I’ve not long got back from town and went to get in the lift behind a couple with their pushchair. The woman stopped me by raising her hand and said “sorry, only two people are allowed in”. I just felt like crying, it is turning everyday people against each other.</p>
<p>We were fine standing next to each other in the shops a few feet away, but now because a poster says we can’t stand next to each other at the same distance in a lift, I’m a diseased monster?</p>

        <p>There are only 2 people allowed in our building elevator and everyone has to wear masks when you’re on building premises (even in the underground parkade!). It’s always me and my husband (so 2 people) in the elevator but when it stops and there is one person waiting I always make a point of inviting them in. </p>
<p>Yesterday we did this and it was a guy, young, by himself and I said “you can come in”. He came in with us, got off on a floor before us and only when he left did I realize he wasn’t wearing a mask, and the whole experience made me feel so full of joy.</p>

<p>Is no number too high? Really? Be honest, you're not going to lie down and let fascism in, are you? You need to appeal to their best instincts, have faith in them. People really are much better than we give them credit for at the end of the day, they're just scared.</p>

        <p>In the US, I expect everyone (even the most hardcore doomers) to start totally ignoring all restrictions by 29 May 2021 at the latest. That date is the unofficial start of summer tourist season (Memorial Day weekend). No way in hell will the US give up a 2nd summer.</p>

        <p>Given people still tithe money to the Catholic Church after hundreds if not thousands of accusations of sexual misconduct by the priest hood, and in my experience that those two circles of people are fairly entwined Venn diagram circles, a lot of fuckery is possible before people will say this is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>It's easy to be optimistic that people are turning against the new normal when you spend time on subs like these, but unfortunately once you glance at normie sites like Facebook it seems almost everyone supports these measures. From my Uk persepective, I saw a FB post by the government explaining what Tier 4 meant and most comments either supported it or claimed Boris didn't go far enough and we need daddy state to save everyone by imprisoning us forever.</p>

        <p>It'll go on forever. Liberals love these lockdowns and aren't smart enough to question the narrative they've been fed.</p>
<p>They've also <em>finally</em> achieved their life long goal of being able to control their neighbours likea bunch of cracked out Karens. The new normal is here to stay sadly.</p>
<p>Imo you're going to see "equity" being repeatedly brought up until other policies are put into COVID bills to address that "issue". Wouldn't be surprised to see "reparations" or the banning of meat consumption in the next few years.</p>

        <p>Well said my friend. I've been saying the same things for months, but so many people dismiss my arguments or refuse to engage me because the topic is depressing. Jesus Christ! How much more depressing will it be when you have been stripped of every freedom you once had? How much more depressing will it be when there are no more concerts ever, no crowded football stadiums, no movie theatres, no small businesses....</p>

        <p>I am. Hence the fact that I wear a mask and will get the vaccine. Because I care about the people around me. If you can't think about a soul beyond your own, and feel "oppressed" by wearing a mask, then you're an idiot. Plain and simple. If you don't have the capacity for common human decency and the empathy to look out for those around you, then you don't deserve to be called a human, and if you aren't a human being, then I could care less if you die.</p>

        <p>Imagine being so stupid that you think a magical piece of cloth can make a cold virus go away. Imagine looking around you and seeing everyone wearing masks since April, but somehow believing the bullshit your politicians and media feed you about that those horrible mythical non-mask wearers that are the reason a mild respiratory virus hasn't gone away. Imagine not knowing even the most basic math and science, that you don't even have a clue how mild respiratory viruses work, or what numbers and proportions even mean. Imagine being so mindless as to believe every asinine word the media and their quacks have been spewing since March. "Let me ignore all evidence that this is a less than 0.2% IFR virus and jerk off to what a hero I am for saving the world!" Imagine thinking you're the one who is a "responsible, wise, intelligent adult", when you don't even have two brain cells that can question this bullshit narrative. Instead, call for and embrace full-fledged fascism because you think you're in a "war" with an aerosolized form of ebola. The fact that we are condemned to share a society with imbeciles like this is precisely the reason we are in this mess. Such an appalling  combination of stupidity and evil is so terrifying, that it exceeds even Orwell's wildest dystopian nightmares.</p>

        <p>Is that why countries that followed the rules verbatim are back in lockdown? Is that why places like CA and NY that were the strictest with the rules are locking down again? Please take your mask and masturbate to it like you faithfully do everyday and leave people with a brain the fuck alone.</p>

        <p>So whats your solution. What do you think we ought to do to prevent the spread? Or are you suggesting just let go and run through the population? I understand arguing or debating the lockdown measures, but I seriously thought that the debate around masks were over. What in the world lead you to believe they were ineffective? What medical professionals or peer reviewed journal did you base the claim that “they don’t do shit?”</p>

        <p>Wearing mask is the problem, not the fucking solution, ya self-righteous donut. If we collectively stopped wearing masks, they couldn't peddle pandemic narrative no more - so there wouldn't be lockdowns &amp; small businesses dying no more either! We are literally more powerful than they are - All we need is to say stop, no more! Go back to doing things we did before this worldwide scam and voila. Crazy how easy it is going back to normal - But you refuse to see! My godt! Stubborn on your own detriment &amp; in spite of tragic, dire consequences that can cost generations ahead!</p>
