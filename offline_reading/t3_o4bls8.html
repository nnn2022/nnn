<p>People who feel strongly about not taking "vaccines" or wearing face masks are either PhD's or drunk bricklayers. It takes about 5minute to figure all of this out either way.</p>

<p>Someone said white people homeschooling was "racist" because it was just to avoid their kids from being around non-whites.</p>

        <p>He isn't describing forced eugenics. Rather that the population be educated to the point where careful consideration is taken before having kids. It is classic economic theory that the higher the education of a population, the lower the birthrate. </p>
<p>This would work towards the 'elites' goals, but requires care and attention. Subversion and lies are definitely easier principles to follow to achieve depopulation.</p>

        <p>Unless proper sex education is part of eugenics, I don’t think he’s in favor of that. Now I could be very wrong, but from what I read it seems that he wants people to understand the consequences of their actions (sex).</p>

        <p>They lied to us from the start until we were let free in a kind of world wide experiment of free will. Leading to the collapse of education, hierarchal beliefs (better than thou mentalities), and the lack of teaching people the trait of conscientiousness. We've made a competitive world where people strive to be better than the other. If one can't make it, they pretend thus you have materialism that's laid waste to a great amount of resources.</p>
<p>They lied in the beginning, saw where we were headed, then knew they couldn't just admit they lied for so many years. Thus, they made a sterilization vaccine. What causes WWIII is the last war this planet will ever see. When people see the truth for the lies. Problem is, there's still a great many that have complete faith in their overlords believing everything in life that we see today is just as it's always been.</p>
<p>The saying that ignorance is bliss is going to die. The most reactionary won't be able to handle the truth as the overlord themselves also have another key up their sleeves. Idealistic possession hence why political conversations cannot be had because it's become a my way or the highway stance. Hence why there's no progress only further societal decline. I blame the internet and it's ability to capitalize on our instincts for our inability to find a collective common ground. This is why Zuckerberg looks so robotic like, because he knows this just as I do or had to learn the painful way.</p>
<p>Lies lies lies is all they spew and they wait for societies fabric to dissemble into utter chaos. The overlords themselves will be at 40K' in their G-V toasting each other for saving the planet. They've given us hints in films because they've known all along. Just look at The Matrix, The Island, Zombie flicks, or even the premise to The Kingsman; where people fought eachother because of programs on cellular devices.</p>

        <p>Just like with any distribution, they may not have been in the effected group (in terms of reproductive issues.) Either that, or the vax hasn't had enough time to work it's way into their reproductive organs. Or, as someone else said, they got the saline control.</p>

        <p>The vaccine induces an antibody response, which is the same end result as being infected with COVID. Unless the development of antibodies after infection with COVID has been associated with decreased rates of fertility, how would the vaccine cause infertility? The mRNA is quickly degraded - that's why it needs a stabilizing outer shell that requires below-freezing temperatures for storage. The people in the hospital I work with had mild side effects so I doubt they got the "saline control" - that would also be extremely unethical. </p>
<p>You're right, we don't know long-term side effects. But we do know that short-term, the side effects of the vaccine are short-lived and benign for millions of people (though there are very rare instances of thrombotic events and myocarditis which are appropriately being studied). And we know that there have not been any issues with fertility related to the injection so far, which is wonderful. </p>
<p>I'm not saying you should get the vaccine, and I don't believe these vaccines should be mandated. I also hate how the pandemic was basically politicized which created a situation where people have been unable to have a healthy debate about our handling of the situation. But a lot of what is being discussed here is a conspiracy theory without basis in reality.</p>

<p>Why are you ruling out being extremely unethical when you say this also? There's already been loads of purposeful and strategic lies from authority figures. The damage done to modern medicine and patient trust is significant. I hate this happened, but I can't ignore that.</p>

<p>There is certainly basis in reality. It's all over the place hidden in plain sight. It's much easier to shake your head and dismiss it as not possible than acknowledge there might actually be some buried truth.</p>

<p>Having a certain degree of skepticism towards authority is healthy, but the idea that vaccines are “population control” is moronic.  Sometimes you have to acknowledge that not everything is a ploy on behalf of the rich and powerful. As much as I think the situation should have be handled more thoughtfully since the majority of people aren’t at risk for severe disease, COVID is horrendous for those who are susceptible. I have taken care of multiple simultaneously crashing patients in the ICU - it was scary and heartbreaking. These vaccines really are a breakthrough for people at risk. It’s ok to acknowledge that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o369yf/men_becoming_infertile_after_getting_covid19/">Here's just one link with the PSA levels in men. There just hasn't been enough time to thoroughly vet everything.</a> Notice how they try and play it off and say it's been "normalized" when the baseline was 0.4 then goes up to 3.4 post vax, then drops down to 1.5 and calling that normal! Almost 400% of your baseline is considered 'normalizing' now?</p>
<p>&rt;but the idea that <strong>vaccines</strong> are “population control” is moronic.</p>
<p>Not all vaccines, but this one is particularly suspect. Am I saying that the vax was purposefully made to depopulate? No. But discovering it acts as a secondary method to cut down on population would not upset too many people at the top. No one really knows all the motives behind this, but it's not hard to see the coercion and strong armed push to get the jab is much more than what's needed for the threat level of the virus.</p>

<p>Yes, they just happen to be pushing it the most in this case.</p>

        <p>I posted the following synopsis and critique of Langan's assessment to my social media profile. TLDR, a fast crash of the global population is preferable to the "elites" given the situation in regards to the health of the biosphere, the many interdependent ecoysystems etc. and they aren't worried about a fast crash crashing the global economy BECAUSE THEY ALREADY CRASHED THE GLOBAL ECONOMY precisely to put everyone in a position where their continue economic survival, a handout, would require consenting to a Vaccine Passport and "vaccination".</p>

<p>He's not the only one to rightly pinpoint the ideology of the "elites", Social Darwinism, revisit my post from June 3rd here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hp.pervinkler/posts/342615970585896">https://www.facebook.com/hp.pervinkler/posts/342615970585896</a></p>
<p>"What is the agenda? Again, to understand the agenda you need to understand the ideology of the actors. Eugenics was the pet philosophy of the well heeled elite at the turn of the 20th century , many if not most who hailed from old money derived from plantation slavery (no, I'm not making this up), what better way to justify such an obscene, inhumane activity (slavery) than to tell yourself and engrain in the rest of society the notion of superior genetic traits / a.k.a Social Darwinism. It's worth pointing out here something I learned majoring in Anthropology, that Russel Wallace had independently developed the theory of Natural Selection but because Wallace was a commoner the British Govt. gave the recognition to Darwin who came from "noble stock". Yes, the very origin of the theory itself has been twisted to suit an ideology. See no good ideas come from a commoner, NO, only the well heeled elite are intelligent (Social Darwinism is a crock of shit, there are black people who will run mental circles around a white person, put any NASCAR redneck in a room with Neil Tyson Degrasse or vise versa, the color of ones skin has exactly nothing to do with intelligence nor the ideological justification to literally enslave or commit acts of genocide on another people ).</p>
<p>This ideology fell out of favor among organized society when Hitler took it to it's logical conclusion with "let's round up and gas the Jews". Interesting fact, IG Farben, who manufactured Zyklon B, which was used to gas the Jews to death, became Bayer, who then purchased Monsanto, yes the same Monsanto who invented Agent Orange and who has also been busy depopulating via Glyphosate resistant corn, soy and wheat (it's been firmly established that there is no need for glyphosate, they insist on using it, cancer in the U.S. has been on an exponential upward trajectory with 1 in 3 women and 2 in 3 men expected to have some form of cancer. This is factual. Shocking right?</p>
<p>Can you see the connections? Oh did I mention that Bill Gates has a cozy relationship with Monsanto and is buying up land willy nilly right now to grow Glyphosate (Round Up) resistant Soy for his "Impossible Meat"? Did I mention that just as the EPA headquarters has non-fluoridated water in their water coolers that Monsanto serves certified Organic food in the cafeteria at their headquarters? Did I mention that 50% of personnel at both the EPA and FDA refused the experimental mRNA "vaccines"? "</p>
<p>Anyhow, my analysis is actually further along than Langan's, and that's not because I'm smarter, no not by a long shot, but because I understand that the "elites" don't need a slow depopulation event "to avoid crashing the economy" no, in fact, they ALREADY CRASHED THE FUCKING ECONOMY via Planetary "Lockdown" (a term as Mike Yeadon points out in his Final Warning To Humanity stems from prison terminology, which is apt, because as Alex Jones puts it, it's a fucking Prison Planet, one big slave plantation. And they crashed the economy to put everyone in a situation where their continued economic survival would depend on maintaining their vaccine passport. No vaccine passport? Ok no continued receiving of your unemployment insurance, your veterans disability, your social security, and of course, you can't enter the grocery store or travel without your vaccine passport and now, having destroyed all of the medium sized business, the family owned stores, to include grocery stores via the Great Reset / destruction of the global economy, there is no recourse, it's either get vaccinated or get shut out of society and starve to death.</p>
<p>You people need to understand they aren't coming to your doorstep with the national guard to force vaccinate the remaining holdouts, no, they will simply lock you out of society. That was the entire point of shutting down the global economy. The other part of it is declaring physical currency a vector for disease and the implementation of a digital currency, a U.S. backed cryptocurrency that will work in tandem with your app (at first, the chip will come later, for "convenience") and that will moderate behavior by rewarding your consumer decisions (that in aggregate reduce draw down of scarce remaining resources) with increased hash-rate. Your smart fridge will know if you bought tofu or meat, or better, if you bought Bill Gate's Impossible Burger. You bought glyphosate laden Impossible Burger? Ok you have an increased hash-rate. Am I starting to paint a vivid enough picture of where we are headed yet? And this is the reality that awaits the 50% of you that don't succumb to ADE / Pathogenic Priming from the non-vaccines during the upcoming flu season. If youre reading this, from the bottom of my heart, take AMPLE Vitamin C (I take 10g a day and I'm not dealing with spike proteins in my organs) , Vitamin D, drop meat, convert to non GMO diet, exercise, and sun light IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<p>Not only did they ALREADY crash the economy and have no desire or need for people to engage in the act of labor with vast sectors of the economy ready to go fully automated at the flick of a switch (the only humans that will remain will be heavily sedated, genetically altered, stunted, chipped, heavily monitored and controlled and will lead short, nasty brutish lives as biological robots, as caretakers of the fully automated systems that are ready to be put in place. Someone will need to go and change the fuse in the Tesla Truck factory once in a while.</p>
<p>They also have at their disposal reverse engineered anti-gravitic and Zero Point energy devices reverse engineered from downed space-craft, 100%. They have not released these to the public because, as I stated many times here, our entire economy, their method of control and power, is derived from scarcity economics. Zero Point energy? If youre the former head of Standard Oil, a Rockefeller, and youre who you are because of sweet crude, why the hell would you want to terminate that gravy train and render yourself irrelevant? So no, they kept the technology from the public, 100%.</p>

<p>So unlike Langan, I have a picture of the situation that incorporates this reality, and no, a fast crash of the population is not a problem for them, in fact, they need the population down to under a billion yesterday, because we are wiping out the planet very quickly and no-one wants to stop taking 30 minute showers, drinking 1 liter bottles of almond milk with 1600 gallons of embodied water, eating copious amounts of meat and dairy, all which require an inordinate amount of water and top soil vs a vegetarian / vegan diet, and we want to fuck and fuck and have as many children as possible because we were told that this is ok because we have a sick, artificial culture that divorces us from nature (the very act of living in urban environments will do this) and we don't know that our modern way of life is completely unsustainable.</p>

        <p>(Continued)</p>
<p>The "elites" know it's futile to ask everyone to not have children and to become a vegan (I'm that person, I've been looking at these problems for over a decade now, a have a firm grip on the situation and did not want to bring a child into the world we are about to experience). </p>
<p>In fact, many of you are recoiling upon reading this, it's unthinkable, I must be wrong! </p>
<p>This: https://www.tellusthinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Earth-Population-in-Chart-from-populationeducation.com_.png</p>
<p>Is not fucking sustainable. It never was. </p>
<p>Our dominant worldview is completely divorced from any concept of restraint or concern for the natural world. </p>
<p>The very fabric of our socio-economic model is predicated on exponential growth. In order for the diaper industry to be viable it must sell more diapers every quarter, every year, because of the nature of Capitalism. If the diaper industry sells less diapers the industry fails. What drives diaper sales? Babies. What drives toy sales? Babies turned into children. What drives car sales? Children turned into adults. What drives economic development? Urban development. What expands employment? Springing up shopping malls and Jiffy Lubes. Eventually, and it doesn't take very long, you have a situation exemplified by sitting in Los Angeles traffic @ 6pm on a workday where all 5 lanes are at a standstill and you run out of old growth forests to convert into Wall Mart parking lots where everyone is encouraged to go and buy new plastic rim covers for their automobiles. </p>
<p>This is the definition of insanity. Worse, no-one within this culture can see the insanity. And when the system fails, the people, unable to comprehend what is happening, partly through programming, seek safety through fealty to authority. </p>
<p>"Tell us what we need to do to return to normal!" </p>
<p>"You must wear a mask, you must stand 6 feet apart, and we must close all schools and shut down vast sectors of the global economy for two weeks (going on two years)" </p>
<p>"Ok!" "We will do anything!" "We are mindless biological robots, we believe everything, you, the talking heads on the television set tell us!" </p>
<p>"Command us oh great talking heads on the television set!" </p>
<p>"THE SITUATION IS VERY SERIOUS, IN ORDER FOR THINGS TO RETURN TO NORMAL WE ALL MUST BE VACCINATED"</p>
<p>"Ok great talking heads, we trust the science!" </p>
<p>"AND YOU MUST CONTINUE TO WEAR THE MASK AND SOCIAL DISTANCE AFTER RECEIVING YOUR VACCINES"</p>
<p>"Ok, anything oh great talking heads on the television set!" </p>
<p>"AND WE, THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC LEADERSHIP, WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS A REAL CRISIS BY BEING VACCINATED (with something other than an mRNA non-vaccine, I 100% fucking assure you) ON THE TELEVISION SET THAT YOU TAKE YOUR COMMANDS FROM" </p>
<p>"I'm ecstatic, you are confirming to me that this is a real crisis, LOOK BIDEN IS GETTING HIS VACCINATION! OH GREAT LEADERS, LEAD US OUT OF THIS DARKNESS!"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And you know, I've only been saying this here for well over a year now, and no-one ever likes any of my comments, hell I don't know if anyone is even reading any of this so why am I bothering with it! I might as well hang up the hat and spend what days I have left playing VR and getting stoned before Governor Gavin "French Laundry" Newsom transitions from carrot to stick, from the "Vax Lottery" to "The Vaccine Passport". My question is, did Newsom and Cuomo take Lolita Express? Because look, I'm NOT a fucking genius, how can I understand clearly what is happening but the governor of the 5th largest economy in the world, the state of California not understand what is happening? And his actions do not gel with his stated pronouncements. Less than two weeks after banning indoor dining last year his ass was caught with 25 other people at a fancy restaurant in Sonoma, "The French Laundry" and no-one had a mask on. Same for what's her face, London Breed, the mayor of San Francisco. Same goes for Justin Trudeau. How can these people not understand that they are committing genocide? They are either in on it or the Shadow Govt have dirt on them because they took Lolita Express. </p>
<p>Anyhow, I'm tired of typing, I think I'm going to give it a break for a while. Langan's assessment of the situation is still worth a read but he doesn't understand that for the "elites" a fast crash is actually preferable considering how dire the situation is in regards to the unravelling of the global ecosystems, top soil loss, water drawdown and biodiversity loss, not to mention, the loss of arctic sea ice. </p>
