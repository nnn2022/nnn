    <strong>My Parents are the worst</strong>
    <p><p>Not sure if you guys have experience this level of bullying before ,but my parents the actual worst. So my parents have been constantly nagging me about me getting vaxxed and ive constantly told them im not interested in getting it. So i had a problem with my car today and luckily my dad gave me a ride back to my apartment and you will never guess what we talked about on the way there...</p>
<p>So i found out my car is basically fucked because my engine needs to get replaced and thats 2 times the value of the car so its not worth it and considering  thats how i make my living.......Anyway, i told my parents about this and i was thinking they would help me with trying to find a new ride since i have no idea on the process. But my  mother went on a random rant of " well if we are gonna have to go looking for a car, you will be too close for me and the fact youre not vaxxed doesnt make me feel safe around you" I basically told her she was being too fearful about it and i joked saying you have a better chance of getting stuck by lighting than getting sick from me. So basically my parents told me unless im vaxxed they arent gonna help me whatsoever, same probably goes with anything in general. Considering my parents are both vaxxed but somehow they dont want me around them........which isnt how that works....</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Im super depressed at this point because my car is fucked and my parents are being completely unreasonable all because of this bullshit thats in their heads -.-</p></p>

        <p>Time to cut ties and figure out how to get a car on your own.  Sucks but it happens and it will make you a stronger, better, more self-sufficient person in the long run.  </p>

        <p>yeah. He's 30. I read this thinking he was like 19 or something. Dude's a full grown man and is afraid to buy a car on his own. Meanwhile people are losing their jobs over the vaxx. This post is tragic.</p>

        <p>Wow, that's sad. It's a cult mentality and so many relationships have been destroyed. Many of us have been affected by it. Destroying connections between people is worse than any virus. It makes me wonder if there was any depth to the relationships to begin with. People are so self absorbed. I would jump in front of a train to save my kids. I can't imagine sacrificing this bond to obey the NWO. </p>
<p>Best of luck finding a new car. I think you will manage just fine without their help.</p>

        <p>Look this is tough bc you sound young and have an otherwise good relationship with your parents. I’d hate to be in your shoes tbh. </p>
<p>But, the situation is what it is. Your mother is scared of her child for not getting injected. It sounds like they are beyond convincing and it may be time to branch out to other people you respect. Relatives? Family friends? </p>
<p>Please do not take the shot under any circumstances. It’s not worth a job, a degree, anything. </p>
<p>It also, unfortunately, isn’t worth your relationship with your parents. I’d say to keep being reasonable and find a middle ground where they tolerate your decision but don’t push. </p>
<p>It sounds like getting some distance may be the only solution to maintain sanity. Sorry you’re in this boat OP.</p>

        <p>Wait so you live on your own but are depending on your parents to help you get a new car?  I mean obviously they care about you enough to want o help you with that as well as your health but if you disagree with something then you aren't forced to accept help from anyone and can do it on your own.  You are obviously an adult.   I purchased all my cars on my own with no co signers or advice needed starting at 18.</p>

        <p>The real issue here is they are treating you like a child and you are 30 years old. This is what you have to fix. It will solve more problems than just the vaccine stuff.   </p>

        <p>No offense, but no one ever taught me “the process” to buy a car or a house for that matter. These are things people do every day. If you’re buying from a dealer they will complete the transaction for you. If you’re buying from a private party and you have specific questions call your state’s DMV to ask what paperwork you need. It’s really not a big deal.</p>
