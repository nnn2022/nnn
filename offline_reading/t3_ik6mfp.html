    <strong>Anybody else seeing mask propaganda (with no explicit reference to COVID-19) popping up across the country?</strong>
    <p><p>Vermonter here. Saw a bus go by the other day with a poster saying “I wear a mask to keep my family safe” - didn’t mention COVID-19 at all - and I thought hey, that’s new and gross... then the very same day a friend of mine down in New York City sends me a photo of an almost <em>verbatim</em> poster.</p>
<p>Is this a nationwide trend? What’s the memo? Is this how they’re going to spring the New Normal on us, by keeping the restrictions up while gradually removing all mention of the disease?</p></p>

        <p>I've seen billboards in Utah saying almost identical things. "I wear one for my family" or "I wear one for my friends". Odd considering Utah doesn't even have a statewide mask requirement. </p>
<p>But it is incredible how there seems to be a full fledged marketing campaign for masks. Feels like it doesn't bode well for removing the mask requirements anytime soon if they're spending that kind of money on a marketing campaign for them.</p>

        <p>Oh really? I hadn’t heard that. That’s been one of my biggest problems with the mask mandates, that no one ever mentions how long they are in effect for or what criteria has to be met for them to be removed. And that’s also what worries me. Except for Montana which said masks were required for any county with 4 or more active cases. Sure it’s another arbitrary number someone came up with with no scientific backing but at least people there know what the criteria is. Until of course they change the criteria once it doesn’t help their narrative. Please make all of this stop already, I can’t take it.</p>

        <p>Funny thing is that most people remove their mask when they are with family at home. So it's obviously not about protecting those closest to you.</p>

        <p>I remember a couple weeks ago it was in the news that the mayor of Miami was recommending people wear masks at home. Of course everyone laughed at him. And of course I did too and still think it’s hilariously ridiculous, but as he mentioned they had determined that most new cases were from family members mixing at home, not just randomly passing people on the street or even a few minutes in a store. So basically what we have been saying the whole time, that you need several minutes at least of extended talking or interacting with someone to transmit the virus. So basically masks out in public are useless.</p>

        <p>Yeah exactly. If people laugh at him for that, they should also laugh at masking in public. But of course that's too much of a leap for most people.</p>

        <p>We’re waiting for 90% of people to wake up, which won’t happen until they’ve been starving and suffering for a few generations, unfortunately. All of this has made it painfully clear how many people are just gutless sheep who would sell their children’s souls if that’s what  the narrative told them to do. I’m starting to wonder if the NPC meme is a reality</p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>1:/ The number one goal of the Illuminati is the establishment of the New World Order, a world government holding executive power over the four corners of the Earth by means of  centralized Banking, law courts and religion.  Eventually even Christianity will devolve under the NWO, as the stated plan is to unite the religions of the world into a single, ‘Luciferan’ faith.</p>
<p>2:/ In order for the New World Order to be accepted by the diverse populations of the world, a policy of total destruction of national identity and pride must be implemented. Only when the Illuminati have wrecked our sense of national community will people be open to assimilation into the NWO.</p>
<p>3:/ As stated above, alongside the one world government and law system, the religions of the world are to be systematically undermined in order to coagulate them into the single, Luciferan doctrine. This is particularly important in the case of Christianity, as the Illuminati are particularly involved in the affairs of the western, Christian nations.</p>
<p>4:/ With the exception of the computer science and service industries, the end of industrialization in all First World countries resulting in the “post industrial zero growth society”. By the establishment of ‘trade agreements’, successful countries can outsource their industries to low wage, low quality workforces in developing countries that the Illuminati already has under the thumb. This leads to mass unemployment/depression and addiction problems in the First World and all of the societal problems inherent in that.</p>
<p>5:/ Absolute and total control of individual will through the means of mind control, authoritarian pressure to conform, predictive programming and technocracy. The extent and sophistication of surveillance methods will leave the human race almost totally neutered in their opinions and ability to resist the NWO. In the words of John. D. Rockefeller, a major Illuminati player and New World Order proponent, “I don’t want a nation of thinkers, I want a nation of workers.”</p>
<p>6:/ To encourage the use of currently illegal drugs by ensuring a plentiful supply and eventually the legalization of drugs to further de-moralize populations. This will be done alongside the ‘normalization’ and proliferation of pornography to the point that extreme forms of sex, and sex for nothing more than gratification becomes commonplace. Numerous sexual revolutions i.e. feminism, homosexuality and polygamy will eventually destroy the aspects of family life that the human race was built on.</p>
<p>7:/ Depopulation. Mass depopulation of populous areas, on a scale almost unbelievable, following the blue print laid out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. The proposed level that the world population would be lowered to is 500 million, or about 1/3 the current population of China.</p>
<p>8:/ In a similar manner to point 4 scientific endeavor will be devalued and undermined, with the exception of innovations that are or could be beneficial to the Illuminati themselves. In line for particular attention is the study of cheap/free energy or peaceful nuclear experimentation. Should a free energy source be found, the One World concept of ‘limited resources’ would become obsolete and the extortionate prices currently laid on natural fuel would have to be lowered.</p>
<p>9:/  Manufacture and manipulation of crises that would bring about mass depopulation of the regions of the world not already affected by the first round of genocide mentioned in point 7. This will be achieved by the inspiration of wars between First World countries and by cultivating disease and starvation in Third World countries.</p>
<p>10:/ The use of unemployment and cultural ‘rebellion’ to demoralize the western world to the point of apathy. By encouraging the outsourcing of jobs overseas (point 4) the indigenous workforce will be devastated, turn to drugs and alcohol and become dependent on the state. The children will be introduced to a form of non-political rebellion (the wear-dumb-stuff-say-rude-words-be-promiscuous form of rebellion) by promoted ‘celebrity’ personalities, causing only the break down of the family unit.</p>
<p>11:/ The removal of personal choice and destiny by the constant creation and management of crises which are then handled by the authorities, eradicating the need for community cohesion. Through the constant belittlement of self-empowerment, the government will become Father, Mother, Giver and Taker (but mostly taker).</p>
<p>12:/ Dissemination of cultural norms by the promotion, either by propaganda or subliminal prompts (cartoons, popular media, celebrity ‘opinion’) of alternative lifestyles such as cults, fringe religions and musician idolatry. This may seem contradictory to the idea of the One World Religion, but the Illuminati are patient if noting else and understand that if the concept of religion is to be demolished, it must first be fractured into splinters.</p>
<p>13:/ The promotion of the State of Israel and the continuing support of the Israeli foreign policy, fermenting hatred for the Western nations among the Islamic nations and eventually lighting the touch paper of WWIII. This will be done by encouraging faith in the Christian Fundamentalist movement worldwide that has been instructed to spread the message of the ‘Chosen People’.</p>
<p>14:/ Empowerment of ‘anti-western’ groups/cults, to the point of creating a purpose built anti western nation. This is done secretively by the sponsoring, via international intelligence agencies, of fanatical religious groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and ‘Al Quaeda’ and maneuvering them into positions of power and influence. This will coincide with new examples of  cultist atrocity and escapism, keeping people in a permanent fog of information and opinion.</p>
<p>15:/ In parallel to point 14, the notion of ‘religious freedom’ will be transported and promoted worldwide, so as to undermine all existing religions and fool members of those religions into questioning their faith, furthering the break-up of society and the moral break-down of humanity.</p>
<p>16:/ Total collapse of the First World economies, which will lead in turn to the collapse of the Third World economies which are unquestionably propped up by the former. The economic turmoil will engender total political chaos and infighting, whereupon the ‘only solution’ will be the amalgamation of all world governments into the World Government.</p>
<p>17:/ Control of the domestic and foreign policies of the United States. Even with the US economy in tatters they are still a world superpower, commanding significant authority on the world stage. If the Illuminati control the States, they also control the assets of those countries indebted to the States, i.e. every country you have heard of in the News lately.</p>
<p>18:/ Support of supranational institutions such as the United Nations and International Monetary Fund, that are not governed by any higher authority, or answerable to any nation’s population, thereby undermining any authority that national or local governing bodies have. When people eventually become accustomed to referring to the mandates of a distant authority, these national law makers/enforcers will become collected under the yoke of the ‘new boss’ i.e. the UN.</p>
<p>19:/ Infiltration and subversion of all governments worldwide. Using the engines of political influence to the detriment of national sovereignty and identity.</p>
<p>20:/ To create, use and exploit terrorist organizations worldwide in order to engender both fear and hatred in the western populations that the ‘terror’ is aimed at.</p>
<p>21:/ The control of education in the western world and the complete deflation of educational goals. This will be achieved by undermining the curriculum, over estimation of student achievement and the destruction of goal orientated endeavor i.e. Outcome Based Education, or ‘everyone wins’ sports activity.</p>

        <p>Holy shit. That's a lot to process, but thanks for explaining all of this.</p>
<p>What's their endgame? Once they rule all material and cultural aspects of the world, what then? They reign in perpetuity, or do they have a even grander goal?</p>
<p>And why would they go to all of this trouble? If they can exert this level of control, don't they already rule the world?</p>

        <p>The endgame is to control the whole world. They will control every one us like cattle, monitor our every move, we will have no privacy whatsoever. I'm sure you've heard of the COVI-PASS/ID2020/Immunity Passport/whatever the fuck they call the damn thing! If you don't take the vaccine, you will not be able to function in society without it (meaning you can't get a job, can't get any education, can't enter any store, ect).</p>

<p>Anyway, I really don't care about your gender when all you seem to do is post incoherent conspiratorial gibberish because you're too afraid to understand how the world really works. Spoiler alert: there was never "honest leadership", you were never "betrayed", and the capitalist world has always been leading up to this point.</p>

        <p>&rt;This is particularly important in the case of Christianity, as the Illuminati are particularly involved in the affairs of the western, Christian nations.</p>
<p>That reason alone doesn't explain their continued obsession with Christianity. They're involved in the affairs of every nation on Earth, and most of the world isn't Christian. Besides, the West is barely even Christian any more.</p>
<p>The reason they viciously attack and deride Christianity--<em>serious, offbeat, highly offensive</em> Christianity--is because that's the only thing that they're afraid of. They're not threatened by Buddhism, or Asatru, or Hinduism, or Wicca, or even Islam. All of those can bend and blend into the "final" religion. At most, those religions pose an obstacle to the dissolution of cultural identity, and they're already well versed in taking care of that sort of thing. Yet you won't see nearly the same level of hatred for any other religion as they have toward Christianity. They're effectively telling you there's something different about that one.</p>
<p>&rt;This will be done by encouraging faith in the Christian Fundamentalist movement worldwide that has been instructed to spread the message of the ‘Chosen People’.</p>
<p>Ironically, it's "fundamental" to Christianity to rebuke the apostate "Chosen People". "Christian Fundamentalists" who don't understand something that basic are an oxymoron.</p>

        <p>Yep. They'll forget why/how masks became the norm.  Repetition will breed compliance. It'll become the new jingle you sing to yourself as you go about your day.  A constant mental reminder to don your muzzle.  And soon people will start to feel naked without their muzzle, just like women feel naked without a top on, even during heat waves.  They'd rather be "ethical" than alive.</p>

        <p>They painted themselves into a corner. They can't admit now that herd immunity is actually very close or already existing in some places, it HAS to be that cases were kept down because of the policies put in place by the admins. They will push this shit until the magic vaccine comes out and <em>that</em> is what gave us immunity, not the fact that we reached herd immunity months prior. </p>
<p>Reading between the lines, I think some higher ups know the truth, but they know that most people believe the propaganda about how dangerous the big, bad covid is, and nothing short of the media turning on a dime and posting a consecutive stories about how the pandemic is over will get the majority of people to see the truth. Enough people are still scared enough to want all the "safety" that the universities have to make a big show of fighting covid. If the frat parties and maskless students around campus tell me one thing, it's that for a segment of the population (5-10%), they know it's bullshit and they are done with it, which gives me a little hope.</p>
