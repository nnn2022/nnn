        <p>Why are these people forgetting that landlords' mortgages aren't being forgiven? Forbearance is not a get-out-of-jail-free-card, and is costly in many cases. No one is protesting for their landlords' protection, how noble.</p>
<p>Oh right, landlords are all elite CEOs living on yachts so its OK.</p>

        <p>I saw a sign that "housing is a human right".  </p>
<p>Um...I would argue that land ownership shouldn't be as difficult and the rules surrounding it shouldn't be so complicated.</p>
<p>BUT, I would not go so far as to say "housing is a right".  Because what does that mean in context?  </p>
<p>Does this mean that all tenants can stop paying rent at will because "housing is a right"?</p>
<p>Does this mean you can commandeer your place from your landlord?</p>
<p>Does this mean mortgages are all null and void?  </p>
<p>Does this mean a contract that you willingly signed with whoever provides you the means for you to have housing is null and void?</p>
<p>See...that's the problem.  You can't call it a right because it gets complicated damn near immediately.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't agree with lockdowns (not lasting this long especially!) or a "new normal", but I do think basic necessities should be a human right. Of course, it's not as simple as declaring them such, but I don't think it's impossible to figure out.</p>

        <p>There are all kinds of landlords.  Corporate property management working for REITs, smaller firms which own several apartment blocks, everyday people who saved up capital to buy &amp; mortgage houses they can rent out, slumlords, and so forth.</p>
<p>None of those are being told "Oh well since your tenants have no money we'll let you slide on paying back the money you borrowed."  Nor do they get any break on their fixed expenses such as taxes, maintenance, and whatever utilities they cover.  So what choice do they have but to evict?  Whether all of them can get new paying tenants is another issue entirely.</p>
<p>In the last property boom that splatted in 2008, there were a lot of people who were encouraged to use crazy leverage to buy and rent houses.  They got wiped out.  I was undecided about sympathizing - on the one hand, they did what they thought would give them financial security, but lost everything. On the other hand... shouldn't they have seen that coming?</p>
<p>Commercial property owners aren't relevant to this post, but wow did they over-leverage.  They have insanely high fixed costs and loan payments, but now their properties are being emptied.  Can't say I have any sympathy for them at all, but they've got a hard road ahead.</p>

        <p>I've been working from home this whole time, got told last week I'm being made redundant at the end of the year. Didn't even get furloughed first. Probably for the best because I'd be even more depressed not working if I'm honest about myself.</p>

        <p>While I agree with the sentiment that those who supported lockdown policies deserve to suffer for the pain they have caused the rest of us, I'm sure there are plenty of people among those being evicted who never supported the lockdown policies that have nevertheless been stripped of their ability to earn enough to pay their rent and who do not deserve punishment.</p>
<p>That said, I believe their anger toward the landlords, at least in many instances, is misplaced. If the landlords still have to make their mortgage payments what do they expect them to do? Go bankrupt just so their tenants can stay in their housing? That's not a reasonable expectation to place upon anyone, much less someone you most likely barely know.</p>

        <p>Contrary to the MSM, not all landlords are billionaires who enjoy screwing poor tenants.  Many of them are hurting as much as tenants from all this.  And I don't think the tenants will benefit if the landlords get foreclosed on and the tenant will have to deal with a bank that IS both rich and evil.</p>

        <p>These are the same people who, just a couple months ago, were laughing at small businesses facing bankruptcy for not having emergency funds saved up prior to the lockdown. Now it’s their turn and they want a free handout because they spent all of their unemployment money on UberEats and Amazon? Every day Democrat’s push me closer to voting for Trump this election.</p>

        <p>As a former homeless person, I can say that there is no limit the amount of cruelty that comes from normies towards the homeless. The smugness, the self righteousness, the hypocrisy, the mental abuse, the verbal abuse, the violence that come from these people deserves them whatever is coming to them.  I hope they have the experience of catching scabies in the shower after traveling for miles and waiting the bath line for hours. I hope they  have to pick bed bugs out of their underwear all day after getting 4 hours of sleep at the condemned homeless shelter because the heroin addict keep coughing on them.
I hope the shelter food slop is barely edible and goes against their vegan snowflake diet and they have to eat it next to a zombie reeking and overdosing on synthetic marijuana (spice, k2)
 I hope the shelter peace keepers DENY them social distancing when the covid poz crack addict is smelling like diarhea shit and vomit, because we ALL now the homeless dont have the right to autonomy in these facilities. </p>
<p>I hope the shelter social worker gaslights them everytime they express how fucked up it is that they are homeless. "You should have just paid your rent bro. It is obvious that you are mentally ill"</p>
<p>I lived through ALL of this AND MORE!! They need to taste reality.</p>

        <p>I never deserved to be lumped in with these people but it happened anyway. Friends and family turned thier back on me, I was alienated and deemed mentality ill.

        <p>That fact should be what scares you most of all, because in case anybody's forgotten, we're supposed to have the most important election in modern history in like 3 months.</p>
<p>Imagine how that's gonna be possible if 10% of the U.S. actually does go homeless in a month's time like everybody's been saying is supposed to happen. With all of the pitchforks, torches, arsons, and mass shootings, I'll be surprised if federal and state governments don't go even further beyond the Moral Event Horizon and just straight-up cancel their elections and impose a second lockdown -- under the guise of a whole new spike which will really just be the autumn flu season miscategorized as the coronavirus, of course.</p>

        <p>They can.  I used to do water shut offs as a part of my job.  We’d just go when the person wasn’t home.  And before I hear how evil we are, I used to cut people a break more than I was even allowed. I’d give people extra time and make up excuses to the boss.  One nice old man, I used to go knock on his door in the morning and tell him I had a shut off (he got them frequently) so he should shower, wash closes, put water in the refrigerator, fill the bath etc and i’d wait till the end of the day.  Then he had some water to get him through a day or two till he could get it back on.  But at the end of the day, it costs money to treat water and get it to your house.  Same with all utilities.</p>

        <p>I doubt it’s illegal to turn off if there’s chikdren there.  I’ve never heard of that.  I’ve never heard of any reason water can’t be shut off legally.  Also, the guys doing the shutoff don’t typically knock on the door.  They just shut it off and leave.</p>

        <p>Idk about other states.  But I do see why there are water crises in America and why water systems don’t have money for upgrades.  It’s a shame that clean water systems, the greatest public health initiative in history, are falling apart in the US.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  People in this country are greedy and entitled.  They think everything should be free, which it can’t be.  Or they want other people to pay for everything for them.  All about money.  Many people don’t want to be responsible for anything.  They want their own money to be spent on fun while others pay for their needs.  It’s an unbelievably selfish attitude.</p>

        <p>What?  Do you have any idea of the amount of money, technology, and manpower it takes to provide utilities to the public?  My guess is no.  That’s the problem with these public debates.  People saying “it should freeeee!” Have no idea how much it costs.</p>

        <p>I find it disturbing how many people seem to think the landlords are the villains in this situation. I obviously can't speak for everyone in this video, but at least some of them are in this position because they were delinquent on payments. And when you're getting free government money, I don't see how that happens.</p>

        <p>Oh this is awesome. Can't wait to be right there with them in my town. I'm not being evicted, but I absolutely detest landlords. Only had 1 good landlord my whole life. Thanks for being a real dude Joe, sorry I lost my job and had to move. :(</p>

        <p>As if supporting lockdowns made this a reality.</p>
