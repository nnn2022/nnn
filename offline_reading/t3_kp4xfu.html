    <strong>16 days since The Fainting Nurse received the vaccine. 20 days since her last Instagram post. Hospital Twitter account private.</strong>
    <p><p>Last Instagram post: Dec 13</p>
<p>Date of injection: Dec 17</p>
<p>Masked, silent group video: Dec 21 (comments disabled, of course)</p>
<p>All the hospital had to do was post a single little follow up video, a 10 second maskless interview with her letting everyone know she is A-OK. Everybody moves on like it never happened.</p>
<p>Instead: silence, stonewalling, bizarre group video. Streisand effect.</p>
<p>Why?</p></p>

        <p>I continue to naively wait for this to get debunked by one simple video containing irrefutable proof of her well-being, but it's looking more and more like that's not going to happen.</p>
<p>It's looking more like the MSM is going to sweep this under the rug with the broom of silence while they patiently wait for everyone to forget.</p>
<p>Here's to never forgetting about Tiffany, whatever happened to her.</p>

        <p>I swear, there is some sort of collapse happening at the highest levels of society. The wealthy and privileged know something is going to happen, which will cause them to lose all wealth and privilege. This pandemic was their last chance at whipping people back in line while still convincing them that they're progressive and free.</p>

        <p>This pandemic is also a great excuse for the mess they made along side politicians. Now they can blame poverty, homelessness and national debt on the virus when these problems were there all along. They are certainly trying to wipe their hands clean.</p>

        <p>I'm not on the "she ded" bandwagon yet but here's what I find odd.</p>
<p>Hate to be overly sexist but any woman under the age of 35 would kill to have the huge number of Insta followers/fame she's gotten from this. In fact I know some with similar followings and it opened up an entire world of possibilities for them. 47k followers is no small feat. It's pretty much instant money in your pocket and she could do anything from simple influencer posts showing off jewelry or yoga pants for a few hundred a post, to starting a moderately successful YouTube vlog channel.</p>
<p>Passing out on live TV is a gift from God and she may never have to work again simply because thousands upon thousands of people saw her drop on TV and thought she was kind of a babe.</p>
<p>This is how Jenna Mourney, Justine Ezarik, Laina (forget her last name, she's overly attached girlfriend), Lauren Drain, Jaclyn Glenn, and countless others got started in the influencer sphere. Something ridiculous happened to them, it went viral, they got a ton of followers overnight, and turned it into a career. The blueprint has been well established and is super easy to follow.</p>
<p>Instead she has gone radio silent and the hospital privated their twitter account. It is literally the <em>opposite</em> thing you should do in that situation and goes against the nature of every female I have ever followed on social media.</p>

        <p>You honestly think that every woman under 35 gives that much of a shit about social media? Sorry but that is blatantly sexist and false. If you truly believe that I would encourage you to try meeting people outside your social circle more, and stop basing your idea of what a woman is on selected online personas.</p>
<p>Being obsessed with image and social media isn't an inherent trait of being a woman, but rather a symptom of the narcissistic culture we live in.</p>

        <p>i dont know what to think about this whole year. the virus is real but it feels like some weird psyop. like the green screen is going to fall over at some point. It just feels fake. Not the virus but the year. I feel as though im in some sort of coma. All this year has brough is nothing but blaming, snitching, arguing and hatred and its famous term 'social distancing' and 'isolation' .not only are we isolating from each other physically, but also on one of the biggest communication platfroms in the world. We all somehow hate eachother. It's ironic that we're supposedly 'all in this together' because it certaintly doesnt feel like it one bit.</p>

        <p>I feel like things have accelerated quite a bit in the last year but OVERALL it's not a qualitatively different trajectory.</p>
<p>The 'COVID purge' we're now undergoing just seems like the logical end of the march of Leftism: we've seen wrongthink purged from every aspect of society over the last 10 years - slowly at first (2010 to 2015) and then accelerating brazenly after that. The social developments alone, from ~2015 to March 2020, would have been UPSETTING AS HELL to an average person from the year 2000. The frog was boiled and it was boiled quickly.</p>
<p>Ignoring any concept of a virus, what are they doing?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Completely fragmenting society, down to the atom (individual). Everybody is forced to be alone as much as possible. Even 'family' means almost nothing any more; previously, no matter what happened in the world, families had each other's backs. Now we are seeing ideological schisms which cut right through the middle of families - read through the venting threads on this very subreddit, or even on pro-lockdown subs. People are taught to believe that even their close loved ones could be 'infected'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Destruction of all voluntary groupings, gatherings, concepts of 'membership' (except virtually, online). One's workplace is no longer a secondary family (for those who were blessed not to be Amazon slaves). Just another group of masked, distanced people who are increasingly only encountered online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Destruction of all independent economic support - small businesses are being culled, are disparately affected by the new laws being enacted by nearly every municipality (ie, Walmart will always be open no matter what - they can afford to comply with anything, and will always be considered 'essential'). The possibility of existing free from the state is being eradicated before our eyes. Just as all the 'conspiracies' predicted - we will be reduced to groveling UBI slaves, because all other employment will be de facto illegal (so expensive that only massive corporations can jump through regulatory hoops).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Destruction of even the possibility of civil disagreements. Old enough to remember the good old days of simple left vs. right? Progressive vs. Conservative? Agreeing to disagree, and otherwise still being able to be friendly, even romantically involved? Well, forget all that: anybody who even expresses HESITANCY at the New Order - Leftism in power everywhere - is an 'enemy' and society will look the other way if those people get punched, trampled, completely de-personed. A person who, for example, disagrees with homosexuality isn't just morally wrong, <em>they might not even be human or worthy of having their basic rights enforced</em>. The terms 'nazi' and 'racist' apply to more and more social enemies all the time, and as we are frequently reminded: it's okay to punch them. Oh, and lest I forget: whiteness = inherent evil, original sin, and must be balanced with sufficient guilt. Whiteness and all the things it represents must be torn down everywhere, to make way for a better world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally: destruction of the very concept of personal, bodily sovereignty. What a person does with their life, their body, their comings-and-goings, is no longer private or considered some inalienable right. EVERYTHING is under the purview of the state now, is open to observation and meddling by wider society. You have a sizeable chunk of society not only cheering but DEMANDING the forced vaccination of others. Anything you do, the second you leave your home (and increasingly, anything you do while home!) is now somebody else's business. And you can count on your neighbors being the first to rat you out if you go afoul of these fast-evolving new rules.</p>
</li>

        <p>i would add to that the meaning of words being lost. and the exercise of one making the discovery of how one knows something to be true, which i guess is another word for philosophy. it used to be that this country had a very strong consensus of what words had concrete and absolute meaning, certain words that had zero ambiguity and were almost "untouchable". that's touched on in 1984 where if you change meaning, you change thought, and as you're losing meaning, you're losing the ability to construct complex ideas about things because sentences are like these buildings that are built upon with words that have the integrity to hold thoughts together. i don't know how else to explain it, but words need to keep their integrity in order for things to keep their understanding.</p>
<p>nazi and racist have had extended meaning to be from someone actually wearing a swastika (which is what a nazi is) to anyone to the right of nancy pelosi, and another which i think is a bit more sinister is what woman means and does not mean anymore with "transwomen". that, on its own is more dangerous because it brings into question what women's sports are, who women's scholarships are for, if someone says they are trans, where does all that stuff land? also things like what does it even mean to be a man or a woman if not for biological facts. had i asked the question 25 years ago who women sports are for, i think i would be alone in saying transwomen/men should be allowed to play, but here we are, it's beginning to enter the mainstream along with transitioning children.</p>

        <p>Another is the word 'bigot', which previously meant <strong>somebody who was intolerant of others' beliefs</strong>.</p>
<p>In a supreme twist of irony, the word as it is now used, is used BY PEOPLE WHO EXACTLY MATCH THE OLD DEFINITION, to mean: somebody with outdated conservative / right-leaning opinions (especially, anybody who can also be tagged as 'racist')</p>
<p>Also along the lines of what you are saying, is people using ideas like Orwell's book to act like victims, even though they are the would-be totalitarian oppressors. They are changing the language and rewriting history, and yet claim it is the dwindling number of active resisters of their efforts who are really in control of society.</p>
<p>So basically, the inversion of meanings to make aggressors look like victims, majorities like minorities, etc. The 'resistance' is the sum total of all institutions, corporations, most world governments, etc - vs. an increasingly deplatformed, voiceless, back-to-the-wall minority of outdated humans who are being painted as the Powerful Enemy who must be conquered.</p>

        <p>The put it on family friends and community members to police us for not complying to mandates. They want use to hate eachother. It’s ridiculous. Plus as far is the virus is concerned, why be so shady about the statistics if it really is that bad. Why aren’t a lot of states reporting recovered cases. Why do they lump in car wrecks with someone that has covid as a covid death. It’s ridiculous</p>

<p>I would want to show she's okay, and back to normal, and that the mysterious third tit she's growing out of ass is just a something she was growing since she took the vaccine, no?</p>

        <p>The original video was distressing to watch, was very memorable and was all over social media. She was an innocent who was duped by UGLY Pig Pharma. I don't think they will be able to cover this up for long because too many people saw the video. She was obviously young and fit so there are *many* questions that Pig Pharma needs to answer. The longer it takes, the worse and worse it gets for them. All hail the Streisand effect!</p>

        <p>&rt;We appreciate the ongoing concern by the community and media. Tiffany and CHI Memorial issued a current video and photograph , on Dec. 21, 2020, of her at the hospital surrounded by nursing leaders, including our Chief Nurse Executive, who support her.  Our efforts must now turn to caring for an ever growing number of people in our community hospitalized with COVID-19 and vaccinating our caregivers and support staff.  We will not be putting out any additional statements or holding any additional interviews concerning this incident. For concerns related to the vaccine, we recommend you speak with your physician or visit www.cdc.gov </p>
<p>Just google it and click news and click "past day" or week.  They all claim to have "debunked" this yet offer no evidence other than the hospital says she's doing fine.</p>
<p>So she is okay with the attention of getting a medical procedure on live television but hasn't posted an update on her normally active social media account for over 20 days?</p>
<p>Maybe she is fine.  If so this is still a bizarre story.  Will she claim that she was all the sudden attention shy after the orders?</p>

        <p>SIGH. I'm frustrated because comments like this (frequently seen in threads about her) gloss over the actual concerns people have. It's like you did a 2-second google search and just linked the first thing you saw, without giving it any real thought.</p>
<p><strong>I don't see anybody claiming she died immediately after the shot</strong>. That interview was the same day - minutes later, in fact[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOH7XLHl2mo</p>
<p>The suspicion is around her continued non-presence on social media (and the fact that if she simply wanted privacy, she could have taken her Instagram private). And the fact that it would have been so easy for her and the hospital to make it clear she is NOW in good health. Not 15 minutes after fainting, or however long it was.</p>
<p>But instead they haven't chosen to do that the easy way. Their choice has been to take their own Twitter account private, after making a weird video with a bunch of nurses standing in silence, holding signs. One of whom is apparently supposed to be her, but whose hair is parted differently from other photographs of her. And of course she doesn't speak so we can't compare voices, either.</p>
<p>It would be trivial - do you understand, TRIVIAL!! - to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is alive and well. And yet they choose masked silence and evasiveness over trivial actions. They could dispel every last rumor with 5 minutes of effort, or less.</p>
<p>This is why people aren't believing the 'fact checking', which is done entirely based on "oh well they said she's OK and that's enough for us!" - just the laziest, most sold-the-fuck-out 'journalism' you can imagine. They might as well have just called Pfizer to ask how she's doing.</p>

<p>&rt; Dover soon recovered, and minutes later was able to get up and speak with us on camera again. The doctors there at CHI Memorial said this is not related to the ingredients in the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

        <p>Well has anyone been at CHI recently and seen her working in the ER? Perhaps she isn’t dead but is temporarily or permanently disabled due to vaccine injury? This isn’t that uncommon with vaccines. Look up the case of Lapierre vs Quebec.</p>

<p>My mom got a blunt instrument left inside of her and then sewn up in her as well after a back surgery. And then was basically paralyzed! </p>
