    <strong>Any way to enter the UK without filling out the passenger locator form or doing a covid test?</strong>
    <p><p>Throwaway account. </p>
<p>Just wondering if anyone knows of a way to travel to the UK without filling in the passenger locator form or having to do the covid test? I'll have to do one to board the plane but want to avoid any there. Might also help anyone else who's planning to return in the near future.</p></p>

        <p>As far as I can tell, you have to pay for the tests, however, they get mailed to you, so how close they go to your nose is up to you. Been loads of stories in the press about them not being delivered on time /  not delivered at all.</p>
<p>I would have said a few weeks ago you could probably get away with putting lies down on the locator forms, but recently there have been huge queue at customs/immigration as they have apparently been checking details.</p>

        <p>Im January i flew into Heathrow and there was a couple border officers on the bridge as soon as you exit and all you had to was briefly show you <em>had</em> the form. Really didn't look at it at all and the e-gates were operational.  Getting out of the UK couple days later was a bloody hassle, and my pcr got checked about 5 times while transiting through Frankfurt.</p>
