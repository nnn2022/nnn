    <strong>Can we PLEASE stick to facts and logic</strong>
    <p><p>Can we please stick to facts and logic over REEEEEEing ourselves over how anyone who disagrees is a literal Nazi? It didn't work for the left, it won't work now, and it's stupid and childish to compare bracelets to arm tattoos and being stuck playing video games at home to getting gassed. I'm pretty sure the whole thing is a false flag, but just in case... Don't. Just don't.</p>
<p>This isn't about ethnicity, nationalism, or divided loyalties. It's about the unethical control of people to force a dangerous and untested drug on people with neither liability for damages nor even allowing enough free information to be heard that people can make an informed decision. If what they are doing isn't wrong unless you scream "NAZI!!!", it's not wrong. What they are doing is wrong, and we don't need to piggy back off the suffering of the Jews like some sad 30-something blue haired gender studies major who never left home to prove it.</p>
<p>Unless you have some specific policy directly unique to Nazism being paralleled, you aren't being clever or insightful. You are just making an ad hominem attack that will make us as popular as any other breed of REEEEEEing SJW.</p>
<p>Make actual arguments, vent if you have to, but don't fuck this up. We have the momentum now, and they are scared shitless by that.</p></p>

<p>Only fucking trolls would say that Nazis are getting "vaccinated" and calling anyone that doesn't want to get poisoned, Nazis...  you see how it works?  It makes no sense... that's how you know its a troll.</p>

        <p>Good point, but while history matters, account age can just mean they got banned. Say the wrong thing in the wrong place too many time, and *poof*!!! Goodbye!!! That's about to get worse, too... Jen Psakai already said she wants people banned across platforms for "false information", so lots of new accounts coming until they finally tie social media to legal ID. After that, it's just silence.</p>

        <p>No one is comparing it to gassing... What are you referring to?  People are making comparisons to Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia to explain that the atrocities did not occur at once and were rather slowly put into place and occurred after a framework of dehumanization and tyrannical rules were imposed. </p>
<p>If you follow what has been going on, and listen carefully to the statements the “leadership” and media are making, logically this could very well turn into a full Soviet/Nazi style ordeal.</p>

        <p>Actually, some have. Even accused me of being a Nazi for questioning them. Obvious false flags, but still... needed to be called out before they muddy the waters and turn this into something it isn't.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bad eggs, and far more uninformed fools, but to compare them these people to Nazis is not what this is. As I said above</p>
<p>&rt;It's about the unethical control of people to force a dangerous and untested drug on people with neither liability for damages nor even allowing enough free information to be heard that people can make an informed decision.</p>
<p>and admittedly other aspects of the lockdowns and dystopian policies, but not scary dead mustache man coming for the Jews. Separate issues, and only used because how obviously it didn't work for the left the last 5 years. They want THIS to be that unpopular.</p>

        <p>I mean, but what’s the next step if the coercion tactics to get everyone vaccinated don’t work? They start force vaccinating? Send people to “quarantine” camps? </p>
<p>I hear a lot of people in real life and in editorials in journals in my county suggesting that forced vaccination should be a thing. I have even heard people say that unvaxxed should be removed from society. </p>
<p>As much as I wish they would just be like, “oh we tried with the vaccinations and didn’t get the rate we desired, oh well carry on life as usual” I think it’s a naive point of view. I’m hearing a lot of very real voices calling for discrimination.</p>

        <p>Look up cannibal island... That was communist Russia, not Germany. Camps are not a Nazi invention. If we want to make this about Nazis, it's not going to be about reality... Same as when the anti-Trumpers made Trump about Nazis. We don't call all painters Nazis just because Hitler painted, same with this. Doing otherwise is just setting up their straw men for them. Camps are coming, and are bad, but fact checker deflect on petty semantics. We all know this. Don't make this about Nazis. Make this about this.</p>

        <p>Not saying you did, just pointing out that turning this debate from "Is it ok to force people to take untested drugs for which they have zero liability for damages?" to "Can they bring out a token Jew?" will be as disastrous here as it was against Trump, and that's likely why it's being done.</p>

        <p>Are you saying that you think it would be okay to force people to take an unnecessary drug as long as the unnecessary drug is tested (which, unnecessary experiments on humans are unethical)?</p>

They have taken evil, seasoned it with evil, and served it with two huge heaping sides of evil.

        <p>Yes, I agree with that, but slightly abstracting the intention of your post here away from the gassing Jews atrocity we get something like: give the fact checkers as little to work with as you can.  Probably alternatively: don't mix easily refuted points with points that are harder to impossible to refute.</p>
<p>For the "untested" argument, they simply claim "it is tested", or some such.  What's your counter?  Can you counter "prove it"?  There <em>were</em> (unethical and shoddy) tests.  People believe in those.  For some people, it IS yet another issue, for the goose-steppers it's an easily dismissible non-starter non-issue.</p>
<p>For the "no liability" argument, they simply point out that it's always been that way.  They might even believe it <em>has to</em> be that way, for example to minimize exposure to fraudulent suits.</p>
<p>For the "forcing it on people", this is where we have to recognize their fascism.</p>
<p>Elsewhere you cited an example of America committing a fascist atrocity, yes that's true.  But fascism was never a way of life for America (until March 2020, of course).</p>
<p>I'd bet you've committed a crime, even accidentally.  I have.  Unless you're very young (unlikely), I wouldn't believe that you've never committed a crime.  Does that make you a criminal?  Maybe in an irrational senseless use of the word, but not realistically.  A criminal is a person that commits crimes <em>as a way of life</em>.</p>
<p>A fascist isn't somebody that makes a grievous error of excessive/unwarranted control of others, it's somebody who thinks of that control as <em>a way of life</em>, like the Nazis did, and like a LOT of Americans do since March 2020.</p>
<p>SO as for the "forcing" the injection, yep, their demented cognitive processes believe that's exactly how it should be!  </p>
<p>You're threatening them with a good time.</p>
<p>The argument everybody is taking for granted is the lack of necessity.</p>
<p>In science, you don't get to just make up whatever you want and then say "prove me wrong!"</p>
<p>That's marketing.  Marketing isn't necessarily bad.  But marketing definitely isn't science.</p>
<p>In science, when you're solving a problem, you don't get to just make up extraordinary measures to solve the problem.</p>
<p>You have to research science and see what has already been discovered that relates to the problem.</p>
<p>For a long time, the red herring to distract everybody had been the marching orders issued to talk about "spread" so EVERYBODY talked about the spread.  In surrender, people in THIS sub talked about spread incessantly; masks this and masks that and so on.</p>
<p>The supposed vaccines are NOT about "spread"!  Everybody knows that, but some people can't reconcile their break from the previously issued marching orders to talk about "spread" so they still relate the "vaccines" to "spread".</p>
<p>But the <em>only</em> thing the supposed "vaccines" are about is: reducing severe illness.  NOTHING MORE!</p>
<p>Science already had a WHOLE LOT of knowledge and evidence about ordinary things reducing severe illness prior to March 2020, including known requirements of the immune system (such as about two dozen different nutrients).</p>
<p>Science also already has known that a lot of people do NOT properly meet their ordinary <em>required</em> nutritional needs.</p>
<p>In science, before proposing <em>anything</em> extraordinary (such as a vaccine), you must first show that proper application of the ordinary (such as people getting the good healthy amounts of ALL of the ~two dozen nutrients the immune system requires) is inadequate.</p>
<p>If science didn't work that way, then science and marketing would literally be the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Science must build on science.  Marketing need not.</p>
<p>Not only is there no scientific evidence that proper9 meeting the requirements of ALL two dozen nutrients isn't adequate, there's a lot of evidence that failure to meet those requirements IS the cause of some people's immune systems going crazy and making them I'll and even killing them.</p>
<p>Vaccines (for this virus( CAN'T be considered necessary until the things already previously discovered by science are scientifically shown to not adequately account for the problem.</p>
<p>Theres more to it than that, but this is too long already.</p>

        <p>Hmmm... well, let me know if you find one. I'm gonna go claim this is about an ethnostate built on the premise than certain groups are a disloyal nation-state within our state so the fact checkers can debunk us by pointing out that Jews exist. /s</p>

        <p>I agree, if we are guided by what the truth is, not our own narrative, we will be victorious. We want evidence to support or vanquish our worries about this vaccine. I saw a post saying more covid vaccine deaths that covid deaths, like bruh. No link to any sources either. That is a defamation post, to get others unknowingly agreeing to that, will get us laughed at. </p>

        <p>Given only 4% of "covid deaths" didn't have comorbidities at play, and not are only about 1% of vaccine side effects are getting reported, but we haven't even gotten into the long-term damages, so this is probably actually true even already. Admittedly, they should have sourced, but... Truth is truth, and they vaxxoids are just going to scream "but muh factchecker" regardless (probably without even reading the citations), so it's not a huge deal...</p>

        <p>Largely, but we shouldn't give them anything to hide behind. Labels change the subject from "is it wrong to force people to take an untested and experimental vaccine for which they refuse to take liability for damages?" to "does this label fit?" is just setting up straw men for the fact checkers. Whether or not big pharma operates in a capitalist fashion is not the question. The questions are rather "are these vaccines dangerous?" and "do they have the right to force them on us?". No wiggle room for "fact" checkers.</p>

        <p>&rt;anyone who disagrees is a literal Nazi? It didn't work for the left, it won't work now, and it's stupid and childish to compare bracelets to arm tattoos and being stuck playing video games at home to getting gassed.</p>
<p>Only for a moment, ONLY for the purpose of considering other issues, let's not think about how the Nazis committed crimes against humanity by murdering over 6 million Jews ...</p>
<p>Now how are the Nazis looking to you?</p>
<p>They looking like a pretty good group of people?  Looking like some role models are they?</p>
<p>Hey, they made the trains run on time, right?</p>
<p>What else were the Nazis known for?</p>
<p>Some people here have made comparisons to gassing the Jews, and those probably weren't the best ideas.</p>
<p>But the Nazis were also known for being fascist.</p>
<p>I tend to call the goose-steppers:</p>
<p>1) goose-steppers, as a reference to the Nazis, and also to unintelligent people acting as a hive mind</p>
<p>2) fundamentalist fascists.</p>
<p>To be, it's avout that lock-step hive-minded goose-stepping, and the extreme interest in controlling others, especially coming from people that misunderstand almost EVERYTHING completely backwards from how it is.</p>
<p>Iml have no intention of no longer making those comparisons.</p>
<p>I've never made a comparison to gassing Jews, and I don't intend to, at least not unless things actually escalate to being like that, which I doubt they will ... But they did do so in Nazi Germany, somehow.</p>

        <p>&rt;But the Nazis were also known for being fascist.</p>
<p>What groups weren't back then? Italy? Soviet Russia? Even the US stuck Japanese in camps... but none of that is the point, which is my point.</p>
<p>This isn't about whether or not they can manufacture Jewish character witnesses (which they can, so all of this is as pointless as anti-Trumpers REEEEEEEing about how Trump wanted to secretly gas his own son-in-law), but rather whether they have the right to stick us under defacto house arrest and force us to take an experimental and untested gene therapy for which they refuse to take any liability for damages.</p>
<p>Last thing we need to do is muddy the waters and give the fact checkers something to hide behind while they point out how "irrationally hysterical" we are to think they're out to get the jews, which was never the fucking issue in the first place... but people just coming here aren't going to know that if all the see is "They are LITERALLY Nazis!!!" being posted everywhere. You're just setting up the fact checkers strawmen for them at this point... Which is likely exactly what they intended.</p>
