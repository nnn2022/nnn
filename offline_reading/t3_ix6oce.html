    <strong>What "the science" TM knows so far makes this even worse...</strong>
    <p><p>So, Sunetra Gupta is a mammoth of epidemiology. Carl Heneghan of Oxford University is of likewise status. There are many other experts of other countries that any sane person could not put in a conspiracy nutjob basket by any standard.</p>
<p>Through them, we learnt that the virus follows a typical pattern of becoming endemic, just like other cold, flu and coronaviruses. We know that by plotting the infection curve and the measures in almost all countries, we would see that the curve just radically went up after whatever arbitrary measures were introduced. After peaking, it went down to numbers that are far from scary.</p>
<p>We know that other countries are experiencing this a bit differently. In Europe, Czechia and Hungary are experiencing their first curve as we speak, as they had very few infections prior to this. But this, in now way disputes the theorem of the virus becoming endemic and herd immunity through T-Cells AND Antibodies.</p>
<p>So let me make this clear: The evidence is out there that interventions do not change anything. They might actually make the pandemic worse, as people are confined indoors. They might just prolong our suffering by preventing herd immunity. </p>
<p>People who say this do not get air time. Politicians are doubling down on increasingly arbitrary horseshit. Just today Markus SÃ¶der (the new Hitler from Bavaria) announced mandatory masks outdoors in Munich and said he might extend it to all of his kingdom. The man is running to be Merkel's successor and the sheeple love it. Apparently some study came out that claims infection rates have been decreasing where masks are worn outdoors but one can only think how conveniently this study was timed. </p>
<p>We are just continuing a shitshow of arbitrary rules that, at best, do nothing or, more likely even, make things worse. Somehow we are in pursuit of becoming like China, which is looking at all of this laughing their authoritarian arses off.</p>
<p>This is all a big pile of horseshit.</p></p>
