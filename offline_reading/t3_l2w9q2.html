    <strong>Ontario: Why do doomers hate Doug Ford?</strong>
    <p><p>People are literally saying he's prioritizing the economy in expense of killing people. What planet are they living on? He's super pro-lockdown, everyone in the PC party is even wearing a mask in their profile picture...</p></p>

        <p>My dad lives in Ontario and he's as doomer as they come.</p>
<p>My dad feels he waited too long to put in the restrictions. He feels that they were too lax announcing that they will take place after boxing day.</p>
<p>There is no hope for my dad. I've tried to get him to see it my way. I won't talk about covid when I call him anymore.</p>

        <p>There are some people on the Ontario subreddit (less lately than before, which I'll take as a good sign), literally calling for a China-style lockdown. Anything that follows Canadian law will not be good enough for them.</p>

        <p>You have to understand something, the people who are saying this about Doug are largely the same people who a year ago called him Canadian Trump. These are the people that haven't been happy with Doug Ford since the start simply on the basis that he is a conservative. There's absolutely nothing that Doug Ford could do that would redeem him in their eyes. The man could literally institute martial law with police out in the streets and they would still say "It's not enough he waited too long." He's simply wearing the wrong colors and that's that. </p>
<p>To add to this point, this is why I'm so confused as to some of Doug's decisions. They are clearly meant to appeal to the above mentioned crowd, however, they never will. All he's managing to do is piss off his base. So I'm not sure if he's really strategically thought this through in terms of reelection.</p>

        <p>Canada is a one party country.  Pick a province and the political landscape is the same.  All shitlibs everywhere.  There is nobody to vote for.  I won't ever vote again....especially after watching US election.  No political solution awaits any of us.  We're targets for these people in charge.</p>
