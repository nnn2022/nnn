    <strong>Questions about the test?</strong>
    <p><p>Every day I question this more and more so I'm looking for any logical answers for any of the below:</p>
<p>If you believe all this is nonsense then obviously you won't get tested would you, if so why?</p>
<p>If you believe all this and get sick wouldn't it (to use their phrases) irresponsible to go out in public to get a test wouldn't it?</p>
<p>If you feel fine why would you bother getting a test?</p>
<p>Why do the number only ever vary slightly each day?
Surely their should be some "slow" days e.g when the weather is really bad surely more people couldn't be bothered going outside getting tested?</p>
<p>How can you believe something covering your mouth doesn't restrict your breathing??? If you think masks don't restrict breathing there's a little test you can do. Time youself and Sprint until your out of breath and have to stop. Then time how long it takes to get your breath back. Do the same with a mask on you'll stop quicker and take longer to get your breathe back.</p></p>

        <p>I get tested because my college makes me get tested. You know it’s negative, I know it’s negative, the tester knows it’s negative, my school knows it’s negative, but the state of NY doesn’t care. </p>
<p>Regarding exposing others if one is symptomatic: For that very reason most testing sites (at least back in Georgia) are drive-through: nobody who’s potentially sick exposes others to the virus. I have been saying this for months with regard to New York policy, but this is also the state whose governor admits to murdering nursing home patients and doesn’t care. </p>
<p>Don’t try applying logic to a situation where the majority don’t think rationally. </p>
<p>Regarding masks restricting breathing: Get yourself a pulse-ox. $20 at your local pharmacy, if that. Rest for an hour, doing low-effort activity only like reading, then test your oxygen levels. Repeat with a mask.</p>

        <p>Normally I would agree with you. The problem is when the school is administering the testing, and they just leave it at “if you don’t hear from us, you’re negative”</p>

        <p>Coming from Georgia, I was officially required to quarantine and then test negative. </p>
<p>I gave New York a blank form, and I just showed up at school and nobody asked questions.</p>

        <p>Doctors will tell you if you have symptoms to stay home.</p>
<p>I had to get tested back in March so I could be seen for my asthma. Apparently covid has eradicated asthma too.</p>
<p>I had to get tested a second time before surgery which is BS because you don't get tested before going to the dentist.</p>

        <p>If you want a reliable test after you think you have COVID donate blood or platelets to the red cross.</p>
<p>Much more reliable test than the swab.</p>
<p>Also, you have a built in excuse not to get the vaccine. If you are positive with COVID anti bodies if you continue to donate you can't get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I've been tested because I was working on a low income housing building replacing windows in people's apartments. A lot of the people living there are older and in poor health (obviously not everyone). While I don't believe this is what it's been made out to be I do feel I need to be careful in the situation I'm in. Even if that's just too limit the liability of the company I represent and the legal implications that could come if it was thought that I was the cause of spread.</p>

<p>I did. My 5k times with and without mask are within 3 to 5 percent, less that normal day to day difference.</p>
<p>There was actually a study where researchers put people on stationary bikes, with and without masks, and measured power output. They got the same numbers.</p>
