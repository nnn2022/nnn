        <p>its a "No New Normal" subreddit, hint is in the name ;)  </p>
<p>To prevent the (no) New Normal, we the people must resist.  </p>
<p>That does not mean that this subreddit is exclusively anti mask/covid (although many against the "new normal" also have opinions on those matters.)  </p>
<p>It's born of the recognition (for me) of ever shifting goalposts and standards lead only one way - to the new normal.  </p>
<p>All the best</p>

        <p>you managed to use 70 words and not say anything, "no new normal" doesn't mean anything to me and your attempt at an explanation didn't get through, also downvoting me doesn't help anyone I just want to understand what I'm looking at.<br>
"stop complying" and "it just takes the public's will" seems like you're saying covid doesn't matter and that its just governments controlling us</p>

        <p>Despite what you say, you seem to of understood me fairly well.</p>
<p>To clarify, I wouldn't say "covid doesn't matter" just that it doesn't matter anywhere as much as we are being told. I would be in favour of targeted protection for vulnerable groups, and the rest of us living our lives.</p>
<p>I would surmise, that it is being used as a vehicle for the government to control us.</p>
<p>Have a look at the world economic forum website if you want to see where it is heading.</p>

        <p>Odd, we seem to have completely different views on the situation, I live with my mother and she is vulnerable to the virus,  in Greece where there is almost nothing being done to prevent the spread of covid.<br>
And what is being done helps noone, we have a curfew from 6 AM to 9pm Monday to Friday and 6 AM to 6 pm which is ridiculous and useless. But stores are open and people walk freely with no masks on. Even schools are open and 30 students are crammed in one small room with most not wearing their mask properly.  <br>
That concerns me a lot since I'm forced to be with others who simply don't care about covid for more than 6 hours every day.  And those people going outside with others that don't care which also concerns me. <br>
I think the rules that are being set are fundamentaly wrong but I do think masks should be mandatory.</p>

        <p>Haha I was so confused at first! But yeah, this subreddit (and maybe if you're looking for something with less rants etc check out r/lockdownskepticism) is a place to discuss other ideas, concerns about the covid strategy and its effects as well as the way it could affect how we deal with future situations, concerns about how people are treating others with opposing views these days and the wider effect of that on society, to share information that the news doesn't give publicity...lots of things actually. It's just nice to have a place where you know that not everyone is pro lockdown and you aren't alone. But I'll admit it can get a bit wild with the conspiracy theories at times (even if they don't seem too out there)!</p>
