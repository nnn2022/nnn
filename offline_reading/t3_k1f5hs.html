        <p>Dogs like that do need a muzzle because they are dangerous. Breathing human beings are not dangerous. They try to tell us our breathing alone will kill people like something out of Black Mirror.  No thanks. Muzzles are for pittbulls and aggressive German shepherds and the like, not for a flimsy virus.</p>

        <p>How? How is asking someone to wear a mask for a deadly virus “controlling us”? Seriously? If they truly wanted to control us, wouldn’t they ask for something more radical, like distributing medicine that has elements in it that would make us more susceptible to following orders? The fact that they have did not do this near the beginning of the outbreak is indicative that they are not trying to control us, but help us.</p>

        <p>What do you do when your dog bites? My dog has Been off leash for 7 years each time he has Been the slightest aggressive towards other dogs (i dont Care who started it) i Will flip my dog in his back and yell at him. Loud and violently. I dont Care if i am inside a mall when this happens, he Will get instantly punished. (Never physically).</p>

        <p>Fines are about 250$ where currently I live. I've never had a problem in 8.5 years. The police loves him, they see I have control of him. I even walked him through stockholm on new years eve at 23:45 through drunks and fireworks. Not a problem. I've lived with this dog in 5 diffrent countries, always off leash, never any fines even if we have met the police in all the countries. They even allow him off leash in the busses and metros. I think it's all about other people seeing you have complete control over your dog, and especially your own body language. 
I was told by police in Sweden that on fridays and saturdays I should keep him leashed in the metro just in case drunk people decides to kick him on the track (wtf)</p>

And i Don't want her to die cuz I'm stupid guy not wearing a mask and spreading some weird flu. I know we have just two possibilities. Wear a mask, and stop spreading covid, save old people, or kill 80% of old people, others will die in few months but other younger people will be immune against it.

        <p>Nobody said you're positive. But if yes, at least 1 person in your family will probably die. Okay, it's not funny and comfortable to wear some cloth on your face, but it may save many people. So wake up dude. Out there is a fuckin pandemic, this is not government "take control of people" party. They're doing it for our own safety. And thanks to stupid people like you, they have to make new laws for wearing masks, and you have 100 000 positive people daily. Here, in Slovakia, we had 100 positive daily. Then it went lower cuz people were good and nobody were doing shits like you. Now, we have 2000 positive daily cuz idiots went to vacations, and got positive in Croatia.</p>

        <p>&rt; But if yes, at least 1 person in your family will probably die.</p>
<p>See how nicely they brainwashed you? This is exactly what they want. Be driven by fear ,give away all your liberties in exchange for their version of security. Just like you had it in ex USSR. THIS, IS FOR YOUR SAFETY, let us find an internal enemy!!!</p>
<p>But yeah if/when  my 87 yr old granny gets it she will die prolly ,which still doens't means ,that she won't die if the lockdowns continue, economy crashes and then consequently medical system and everything else collapses with it. Maybe this flu kills old ppl ,but poverty due to unemployment and lockdown related lack of care will kill more perfectly healthy ppl and i think it's intentional. I am hopefully wrong ,but looking the events unfold... i dunno.</p>
<p>&rt; Now, we have 2000 positive daily cuz idiots went to vacations, and got positive in Croatia.</p>
<p>So if you are anything like us in Slo you go to the vacations in summer... Now ,it's almost december ,and you truly believe that GVT line ,that this is bcs ppl went to have holidays like 5 months ago? And they were allowed to go anyhow... As i said ,let us find the internal enemy,so we won't point finger at GVT instead. Or was the spike more bcs of increased testing that happened this fall and the fact that tests are known to create false positives? Haven't you guys had like nationwide compulsory testing? If that isn't fishing for cases, i dunno what it is.  And why is everyone talking about cases anyhow? Cases aren't deaths. Here we have from like 1500 cases like 5-8 ppl dead (sometimes less ,sometimes more but nothing critical and our mortality rates this yr aren't any higher then before) . They were all old or sick from before and the youngest victim we had was 40+ with pre existing conditions. Is that really the plague ratio they are selling? IMO ,that isn't the epidemics, it's casedemics. It's sad that those ppl died ,but shit happens in the epidemics and as we see ,we can't really save everyone. And it's not like i'm immune, i could die too ,prolly won't cos i'm young, but i am not expecting the world to shut down in order to save me.</p>

        <p>I agree with first part. It's not a bad idea. But why would government want to destroy economics? They will not have profit from it.</p>

        <p>Well hopefully, there trully isn't a conspiracy and me and ppl like me are wrong ,but just as you can brainwash ppl to do something,  the corporative leaders can brainwash GVT's that this is in their best interest, to lock everything down and to borrow piles of cash from the world's bank and they prolly don't see the bigger picture either, as the local GVTs that are currently in power, care more about their political points so ,if ppl beg them for lockdowns ,they are gonna give it to them ,in order to remain popular.</p>
<p>Or there might be no conspiracy and they trully believe that this is the best and the same principle of caring for political points applies in that case as well.  </p>
<p>Obviously i dunno what's really going on ,but things are really getting sketchy if you look at the bigger picture. I never hoped that i'm wrong more than this time and if i am, i'll have no problem in apologizing for it. It's not a competition for me and this is the first time ever i'm dabbling with conspiracies. I never really believed in them, but this one is sketchy as i said. I dunno ,will see IG.</p>

        <p>Okay, so please wear mask and use some disinfection at least between people, where is big chance of spreading it. Save other people if you don't care about your own. Seriously. Also I don't wear it when I'm with my best friends, cuz it's annoying. But 1500€ fine for not wearing it is way too much for me so I'm wearing it. Btw 5G towers spreads covid and cancer ;) also vaccines causes autism :D (I'm just kidding)</p>
