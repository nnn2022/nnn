    <strong>Situation in MI, WI, NY, LA, IL, WI, WA,PA,MN, OH and MA outside the problematic urban areas (NYC, LA, Bay Area, Madison, Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, Twin Cities, Seattle and Columbus); how is it faring with regard to pandemic responses?</strong>
    <p><p>I had brought this up before as part of a set of inquiries and was actually informed by members in November that after a few weeks, when reports of cases and calls for shutdowns by hysterics would go up, that it would be a good time to gauge the extent to which the public is going along with it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The aforementioned states for the most part have shutdown trigger happy governors and large cities with a mindset treating this as among the most dire threat to civilization to ever incur upon us.  That said, these states also have numerous rural and even suburban and urban areas that are fundamentally different and closer in general culture to Texas, The South, Florida, North and South Dakota and similar states.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So I was wondering, for those in any of the aforementioned states, who are not in the hysterical urban regions, how has life been?  Has compliance been total and unquestioning?  As there been the kind of fear where citizens talk and freak out over it all day, all week?  Or has it been closer to rural Texas or Florida?</p></p>

        <p>I'm in the Twin Cities, but my parents are in rural MN. People in rural MN are fed up with the restrictions, but for the most part, still all wear their masks. It's how these sheep here act. It's in their blood to avoid confrontation.</p>
<p>For months now, I've been the only person I see in stores unmasked. I've only been confronted once (by an older man with a Vietnam vet cap... Go figure... That dude fought for our freedoms and is now yelling at me).</p>
<p>I've also done some traveling in rural WI and will be going there this week. I'd say compliance is less there than in rural MN.</p>

        <p>In PA unless you're in one of the big cities nobody seems to care and it's all theater.  </p>
<p>I love the outdoor dining here: a big fucking enclosed tent.</p>

        <p>I live in a suburb of Minneapolis, MN and everyone typically wears a mask while inside in public. However. I know many people who did not follow the governor’s orders to not gather for thanksgiving with people outside their household. I do believe there are a lot of people following the rules M-F, but come the weekend, they are still getting together in their own homes. </p>
<p>I work in the construction industry and it is interesting how my company is handling “exposure” on job sites (which are considered “essential” in MN). Most large construction projects are sending large amounts of subcontractors home for 2 weeks if there is a confirmed case, so my company has decided to swap our staff between projects... I.e. if person A cannot go to project 1 because of potential exposure, we will send person A to project 2 and then take person B from project 2 and send them to project 1. This isn’t just my firm, it is every firm pulling this stuff. </p>
<p>I also grew up in Waukesha County in WI. My folks live there still and the county has decided to defy the WI governor’s order and remain open. Restaurants are packed because people from Milwaukee County and Dane County are going there to dine, shop, entertain.</p>
