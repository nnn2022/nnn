    <strong>I wish the media would just tell the truth at this point</strong>
    <p><p>Let's be honest. At this point, I think the "powers that shouldn't be" should just stop with the whole charade of covid and just tell people the truth:</p>
<p>"Listen. We lied to you and we don't give a fuck. Everything you have been told since birth is a lie. This money you slave for every day isn't worth anything and we duped you into giving us all of your gold and silver in exchange. We own you. Covid is a lie as well and you retards fell for it because you've been trained through years of education to bow down to authority. We're doing the Great Reset. The vaccine was to sterilize all of you and kill you. We have a total population goal of 500 million by the year 2030 and we're going to force most of you into smart cities where you will be monitored and controlled 24/7 for our benefit. You won't own shit. You were never taught how to kill your own food or survive without electricity on purpose. So for now, we're going to crash the economy and give everyone a universal basic income every month to buy whatever you want, as long as you play by all of our rules. You'll need us to live. If you don't play along, you can say goodbye to grocery stores and the new world we are setting up. You are going to die alone. So in the words of John Lennon's Imagine 'I hope some day you'll join us, and the world will live as one' "</p>

        <p>It's worse then that, they've brainwashed people. Anyhow you would just get "YoUrE a CoNSpiRacy ThEoRIsT! as answer. They have presented a whole reality that people have embraced. The American Dream which is like a nightmare, is a cult within itself. It's in books, movies and everything else you can think of. </p>
<p>​I used to like UBI, been too broke, but now I know they will use that for control.</p>
