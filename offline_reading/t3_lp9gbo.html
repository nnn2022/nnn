        <p>Well, this is what those who advocate the lockdown among the general public seem to have overlooked.</p>
<p>We've just handed the authorities the carte blanche approval to lockdown society whenever they feel like it. </p>
<p>What happens when we're told that there's another virus that's worse than Covid? Are we going to lockdown society for 18 months every time this happens?</p>
<p>We've been told over and over again. This is unprecedented. This is unprecedented. It's not unprecedented. It's not even close to being unprecedented. It could easily happen again.</p>
<p>People think the (dubious) death toll is the worst of this issue. The shit hasn't even begun to move in the direction of the fan yet. </p>
<p>But don't worry, concerned general public, because the media will provide an explanation for all of the nasty consequences which happen in the near future that completely absolves the authorities, while handing them more power and control. And you'll suck it up like sugar.</p>

        <p>scum of the earth.</p>
<p>the media is profiting massively of the plandemic while every one is forced at home, nose-glued to their screens reading the next piece of news. massive amount of clicks.massive profits. </p>
<p>of course they want this to keep going on and on and on. no wonder why they keep pushing every single piece of bullshit like vArIaNtS</p>
