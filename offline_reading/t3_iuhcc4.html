    <strong>How can I do as an individual to change people's mind?</strong>
    <p><p>I am not from the USA, I am from Greece. Masks are only required in supermarkets and other closed space places but everything is closed after midnight. You can't go for a drink, you can't have parties, you can't have fun in general. Lock downs ended before summer to save the holiday tourist season but I am afraid they are coming back soon.</p>
<p>I speak my mind freely, I tell others how I don't believe we should have masks and lock downs but I still wear one when absolutely necessary to avoid getting violation tickets, which are 200 euros. </p>
<p>Some protests are happening but they are mostly attended by extremely right wing, borderline neo nazi people. I want to express my disagreement with the current mandate, not support nazis, be associated with them or do anything that has to do with politics in general. What should I do?</p></p>
