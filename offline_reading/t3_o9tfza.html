    <strong>"Stupid" doesn't even come close to describing current events</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sorry but HOLY SHIT, with the Matt Hancock incident being the last straw, I needed to post this right now, because "stupid" is perhaps the understatement of this fucking decade.</p>
<p>How, just HOW do people still think this is about "keeping people safe" when time and time again, politicians that have set their own rules are BREAKING it also? Putting the G7 2021 world leader summit aside, they would never admit it unless they were accidentally caught, and despite that, it doesn't seem to put a goddamn dent in people's brains that perhaps something is wrong with the official narrative? Politicians breaking their own hotel quarantine rules doesn't ring any alarm bells? Politicians not acting afraid off the camera (if this was really a threat) didn't ring any alarm bells? Politicians are humans, why would it be different for them? Unless....??? <strong>A death with covid is counted as a covid death but then they use different logic for the vaccines and say that "the experimental vaccines that haven't been out for a whole year couldn't have done this?" So the vaccines aren't even a year old yet everyone seems so fucking certain, huh? Damn, I guess time travel was invented quite early!</strong></p>
<p>"The unvaxxed should lose their rights all because they're skeptical of something that isn't even a year old?"</p>
<p>I actually saw this hilarious bit in one of the other subs (forgot which one)</p>
<p>"This is setting a very dangerous precedent, are we just going to lock down from here on out? We need to accept risk"</p>
<p>YA THINK? IDIOTS OMG</p></p>

        <p>I don't have the energy to stay mad with the holy rage I feel when I see this stupidity in person. I just don't care about anyone else anymore. If the fact that the idiot evil politicians were breaking all their rules didn't cause them to stop and think, I doubt anything else will.</p>
<p>That said, I have no qualms about rising up when the time comes for that holy rage to be released. I've been trying to stoke this fire in others, but haven't seen anything happen yet but it feels like it will soon be here.</p>

        <p>Yep. Although I did like the outrage when I saw the WHO (World Health Organization) saying that even the vaccinated should still wear the mask anyway, and it got so bad to the point that the Coronavirus mods had to lock the thread</p>
<p>Seems like the vaccine goalpost shift is what will trigger the "fire", so to speak, since the "vaccines being the way out" is the longest lasting goalpost that many people were putting their hopes on.</p>
<p>Also a nice thing to note, the CDC hasn't yet changed their rules, only the WHO so far. CDC did make a warning about the delta variant but still advocates no need for masking if you're already vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I think the CDC is just holding out to see what kind of fallout the WHO gets. Both are crooked beasts and super liars. Their only aim is to shift the goal posts to benefit their masters.</p>
<p>Its hard having your eyes wide open to this stuff.</p>

        <p>Because the Truth needs to be repeated 1000 times of anything that tickles their ear, just to overcome it, and that's why it is near impossible.</p>
