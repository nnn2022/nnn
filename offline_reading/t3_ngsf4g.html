        <p>If 3k people died per day of auto accidents, it would be the leading cause of death in the US by a LARGE margin. Actual amount is 36k per year which is roughly 98~ people a day.</p>

        <p>It's a pity that some of the numbers are off, but the main points being expressed here are accurate. Surprisingly, not many people seem to be aware of how the WHO, in April 2020, <a href="https://notesfromthenewnormal.com/?p=314">ordered changes in the way which deaths are registered</a>. The WHO instructions are the main reason why so many deaths are attributed to Covid-19. The article I've linked to describes in some detail how this works.</p>

        <p>No, that didn‚Äôt happen.</p>
<p>It was a bad early report about how much cares act funding hospitals got vs how many covid cases they had seen. The two things weren‚Äôt related, cares act funding was based on Medicare patients taken care of historically by that hospital.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs no cash for diagnosis, there‚Äôs definitely no cash for deaths.</p>
<p>The only ‚Äúincentive‚Äù is a Medicare top up of 20% for bulk billing of covid patients, but that‚Äôs hardly a windfall as covid patients require a great deal of care, hospitals had to bring in highly paid temp staff, and Medicare pays below market even with the top up.</p>

<p>Absolutely no bonus for a tested positive case, nor for a death.</p>

        <p>If the number of COVID deaths is so inflated, and all these people who died of COVID were going to die anyway, they why do excess death figures since the pandemic generally slightly exceed the counted number of COVID deaths, and why is it that when you track that data over time there happen to be three peaks that line up with the COVID surges in March, August, and December? Seems improbable to me that this would be random chance.</p>

        <p>You should read the article. There's no ifs about it. New rules introduced by the WHO in April 2020 mean that all kinds of deaths which would have previously been attributed to other causes are now attributed to Covid-19. The OP suggests that figure is 95%. I'm not sure if it's quite as high as that, but it's likely 80%+</p>
<p>Global or local excess mortality is another matter entirely. While some countries experienced excess mortality in 2020, this doesn't alter the fact that deaths have been, and continue to be, massively misattributed.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs incredibly difficult to convincingly assert that there‚Äôs been a dramatic over counting of COVID deaths when these excess death numbers so clearly align with the reported number of COVID deaths both in quantity and the specific timing of the excess deaths.  You can argue that you think standards for what counts as a COVID death could be improved, but to argue that these standards are producing death counts that are 20x higher than they should be as this post originally does is patently disproved by excess death numbers which are actually above current COVID deaths. In fact this data actually suggests that these new standards may actually undercount COVID deaths, unless you have another explanation for excess deaths being comparable, but slightly higher than counted COVID deaths, again with the major spikes in COVID deaths aligning temporally with spikes in COVID cases.</p>

        <p>The article I mentioned not only asserts this but also illustrates how it's done. It offers proof that Covid-19 deaths are vastly overestimated.</p>
<p>We can speculate about the relationship between Covid-19 and excess mortality (as we can about that between mitigation measures and excess mortality), but ultimately we're guessing. A 'death' from Covid-19 is not the same as a death from any other cause, in the same way that a 'case' of Covid-19 is not the same as a case of any other illness. Nomenclature and taxonomy have suffered and so, as a result, has our ability to accurately assess the situation we face.</p>
<p>In relation to excess mortality being higher than deaths attributed to Covid-19, it's worth noting that the CDC estimated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm">one third of all excess mortality</a> in the US last year was due to reasons other than Covid-19.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean about spikes in deaths aligning with spikes in cases. When the first surge of deaths happened in March/April 2020, case numbers all around the world were very low (leading to an overestimation of the case fatality rate).</p>

        <p>The article you mentioned only demonstrates that they set a standard for what counts as a COVID death that differs from other diseases, that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad standard, and again because excess death numbers align with COVID deaths in quantity and timing, that suggests it‚Äôs a fairly good standard. If you don‚Äôt think COVID has caused the majority of excess deaths, then explain to me why 2020 and 2021 have seen elevated mortality relative to other years, well beyond variation that normally happens year to year, and specifically aligning with the timing of COVID outbreaks in the US in March, August and this winter.  Official case numbers were low in March but that is mainly because they didn‚Äôt have much testing back then, and experts do generally say now that COVID was fairly widespread in the US in the time the deaths started.  They may not all be COVID related, but the study you cited doesn‚Äôt say that 1 in 3 are not, it says that at a MINIMUM 2 in 3 are COVID related. That does suggest that even if COVID deaths were overstated, this impact is at most fairly minimal because even if you knock off 1/3 of excess deaths, the number is still fairly close to the official numbers for COVID deaths being reported. Mathematically there just is no room for this 5% number in the original post, that‚Äôs so far off base as to be functionally impossible, and in truth it looks to me like the official number is quite accurate given this excess death data. Unless you have a better explanation for the excess deaths, I find it believable that COVID killed about as many people as we think it did. At least that‚Äôs more believable than the idea that somehow COVID killed very few people but a lot more people than typically do just randomly died of unrelated causes around when COVID was spreading and we think people died of it.</p>

        <p>The point is not whether it is a good or a bad standard, but that it is a standard unique to the measuring of deaths from Covid-19. Nothing else is or was ever measured this way. The WHO guidance was unprecedented. Until April 2020, the underlying cause of death on the MCCD form referred to the first in a chain of events which led to a person's death. Now, a positive PCR test means that Covid-19 takes precedence as the underlying cause of death, no matter what long-term conditions the person had. Even if the person had shown no symptoms.</p>
<p>During an influenza pandemic, for example, there will always be excess mortality. The vast majority of people who die will be those who have underlying conditions (comorbidities). In all these cases, the underlying cause of death (for the purposes of the MCCD form) will be comorbidity and NOT influenza. Only a relatively small number of deaths in an influenza season will have flu as the underlying cause of death. It's not about people randomly dying by coincidence, it's about misclassification. </p>
<p>In many countries, deaths from other causes (e.g. cancers, dementia, renal disease) have gone down compared to previous years, which is unheard of in a pandemic. At the same time these countries have large numbers of Covid-19 deaths. Excess mortality is to be expected in a pandemic, but the way excess mortality is being reported is unique to this one.</p>

        <p>But if COVID deaths were significantly a result of misclassification then excess deaths should either be 0 or dramatically lower than the number of COVID deaths being reported. You can‚Äôt create excess deaths without something killing people in greater numbers than they usually are.  Mathematically there can‚Äôt be a significant amount of people dying of other causes and being labeled as COVID unless they‚Äôre also missing large numbers of people who are dying of COVID and misreporting those as regular deaths, because if someone with COVID were going to die anyway, it wouldn‚Äôt cause an excess death. That means while COVID death reporting may be unique relative to other causes of death, it isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad system because it gives a roughly accurate if a bit underreported read as to about how many people would be alive if it weren‚Äôt for COVID. You can say that many of these people had preexisting conditions, but the fact is that if excess deaths are high, those people would not be dead if it wasn‚Äôt for COVID, because that‚Äôs the only thing that one can reasonably argue changed this year, so it doesn‚Äôt sound that unreasonable to say our current count is roughly the death toll of COVID. My main point is just that to say only 5% of COVID deaths should actually count, that isn‚Äôt true, because most people dead from COVID would not be dead but for COVID based on excess death data.</p>

        <p>I tend to agree, on the scale of it. However, it's pretty  easy to say we have an invisible enemy, and then forge tests/statistics, when you have the top of virology/epidemiology bought and corrupted, and have the worldwide scumbag puppet media make it look like a pandemic. I still think the space-hoax is the biggest, in scope of the history of mankind, and anti-God agenda.</p>

        <p>After years of research, I came to the shocking conclusion that the Bible is indeed the only work that describes earth, humans, and the heavens perfectly. All the lies they pull through theoretical sciences, have only one goal: to hide this from us. That's why you only see masons/satanists at the top of these agencies and sciences. Evolutionary biology, theoretical physics, all just theory. Unprovable, and unproven. I took quite the beating when I found that out, but it's worth it. God bless, use your eyes and ears.</p>

        <p>All religions are infected by corruption, including RCC.</p>
<p>The bible, however, is the inspired word of God, and the Truth of this world. If you think God is responsible for all evil, you don't know anything about the Bible and are completely misled. The sadist God paradigm is a typical satanic trick. Satan is the lord of love and tolerance and acceptance. It's all good baby. </p>
<p>God let's US fix it on earth. He gives US the freedom to act as we want, including making a mess of it, because this life is a TEST, a test of character. Fixing everything for us, would defeat the purpose. It is because we have drifted so far from the Father these last days, that mankind is completely lost, astray, and totally influenced by all kinds of evil. God will even allow a delusion like Covid to happen, because His goal is only to separate the believers from the unbelievers. God wants Heaven filled with clean and true spirits. Not weak, sinful, rebellious ones that are so vain and think they are their own god. Gnosticism is somewhere in the middle, but also leading smart people astray from the truth, because they are too vain, too smart, to accept and bow to the Creator.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's just the flu. More dangerous or not, I don't know. There has been so much tampering with statistics that I don't think the death count means anything anymore. In my country, the death count wasn't any different last year from other years. </p>
<p>But this is a sidetrack. My point was that the flu has been overwhelming the healthcare systems in several countries for years, but no alarms were raised. Lots of doctors spoke out against this selective indignation.</p>

        <p>If hospitals are routinely overwhelmed by the flu, that is a bad thing and should be fixed, but I think raising alarms for covid was appropriate, since it was demonstrably worse than the flu.</p>
<p>In the US we had a higher weekly death rate starting in march 2020, which clearly indicates that covid is out of the ordinary, and that out of the ordinary behavior was appropriate. </p>

        <p>&rt;In the US we had a higher weekly death rate starting in march 2020, which clearly indicates that covid is out of the ordinary, and that out of the ordinary behavior was appropriate. </p>

<p>I don't think it's that strange that a country with such an unhealthy population is hit extra hard.</p>

        <p>I totally agree, but I don't think it would have been reasonable for the government to say "we're unhealthy, we deserve this." The government had to take action to try to minimize the impact of covid</p>

        <p>Why didn't that action include ways to live a more healthy life? They could have easily set up ways to get in shape. We knew a year ago, during the first wave, that fat people are a lot more at risk of getting hospitalized with covid. Why not have some goverment-sponsored exercize program? </p>
<p>I can already see the slogans: 'get fit to fight covid'. 'a workout a day keeps the virus away'. You could have a daily follow-along workout instruction thing on TV every day. Some hot chick in yoga pants, like in the 80's.  Same with healthy cooking. Why not?</p>

        <p>I think the government had to focus on measures they knew would be effective and easy to implement. Masks and social distancing have an immediate impact, whereas weight loss takes time, and is notoriously hard to keep off.</p>
<p>On top of that, the government has routinely tried to get people to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Remember everyone shitting on Michelle Obama for trying to make school lunches healthy, and trying to get people to excercise?</p>

<p>They tried to bring freedom and democracy to other places before and failed, but that never stopped them from trying.</p>

        <p>How is overwhelming our healthcare system not a problem? Don't you want there to be available beds if you get some other disease? Don't you want reasonably rested medical staff? Don't you want anasthetics to be available if necessary?</p>
