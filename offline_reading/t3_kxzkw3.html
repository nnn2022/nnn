    <strong>a petition not to overuse "doomer"</strong>
    <p><p>i've seen a lot of general disdain for "doomers" here, which i would like to mention already is completely and utterly understandable. it is, of course, very annoying to face such a person who has given up on life so hard that they project their hopelessness onto you, aggressively.</p>
<p>for the particularly bad ones, "doomer" is just a fair synonym for things like "sjw", "libtard", "marxist", "total maniac", etc, but i would like to bring to attention that this movement won't win without the help of the general populace - most of which do cleanly fall under the term "doomer". hopelessness of the non-aggressive kind, apathy, depression, so on and so forth, has been a deliberate side effect of the new normal, and us who are more hopeful or awakened can't and shouldn't alienate the less fortunate who have simply fallen victim to Big Media. it can be hard to be nice, sometimes you just wish you could physically slap sense into them, but faced with (rightful) extreme opposition or upset right off the bat, the average doomer WILL only become more shut-in.</p>
<p>those that knock the olive branch out of our hands and leave only the sword are not the average man and woman, and you must remember this when deciding which one to put forward. seek to enlighten those that seem merely unhopeful, rather than lumping them in with those that seek us all harm.</p></p>

        <p>I upvoted this, but i also feel that just saying “doomer” as shorthand for people who have taken and ran with the worst case early March view of this “novel” virus is descriptive, slightly accurate, and critical enough that might cause a doomer to reflect on just how extreme the reaction and general societal level of fear has been.  Maybe there are better ways to describe the fearful mindset that has become the majority, but i think there are many worse and more insulting ways, not to mention longer winded ways to say “people who look at covid as a mortal threat to society at large, or enough to justify medical martial law.”. I appreciate wanting to expand the tent and commend that, and the idea that being judicious with our language is a key part of that.  Open to other ideas or being proven wrong; I also would love to see more people come to our side, and come to their senses that this “science” has been a hyper politicized overreaction with huge societal consequences, and dripping with virtue signaling and conflicts of interest.</p>
