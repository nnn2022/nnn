    <strong>Thoughts for your consideration</strong>
    <p><p>I've read through the Top Posts, and in the spirit of the first three rules of this sub, I would like to offer the following observations about various pandemic topics:</p>
<p><strong>The State of Science</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>About 18 months ago, everybody started with the same amount of knowledge about this virus, which is to say none. There were similar viruses, but none exactly like this. When it comes to situations where people are dying for unknown reasons, a brute force approach to mitigating a highly communicable disease was the failsafe approach to halting it. There was a lot of ignorance going around back then. There is still ignorance going around now.</li>
<li>Science is an iterative process, and mistakes were and will be made--There was confusion about many things in the beginning (hand-washing, cleaning surfaces, masks not recommended). Now the science is catching up (but not finished), and it's still a highly communicable disease but at least there is a pathway to the normalcy we all crave.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virus Transport</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It seems to me that a lot of confusion comes from a less than clear explanation of virus transport. I'll try to put it in understandable terms.</li>
<li>Concentration is a balance of rates, that is Virus In - Virus Out +- Virus Generated = Virus Accumulated. Virus In, Out, and Generated have units of Particles per minute. Virus Accumulated is Particles per cubic meter.</li>
<li>If you are in a closed room with one quiet infected person not wearing a mask, Virus In = 0 and Virus Generated is a positive value, let's say 20 particles per minute. If you don't have a removal term (open window, filtration), then Virus Accumulated equals Virus Generated times time divided by the room volume.  So for a quiet, infected person not speaking, assume 20 particles a minute for an hour in a 100 cubic meter room would give 20 particles/minute*60 minutes/hour*1 hour/100 cubic meters equals 12 particles per cubic meter.</li>
<li>If that infected person is singing, they release a lot more infected vapor and increase the the generation rate by a factor of 100, which would make 1200 particles per cubic meter in an  hour.</li>
<li>If that room with the singing person were 50 cubic meters and not 100, the concentration would be 2400 particles per cubic meter.</li>
<li>This is the crux of it, enclosed rooms with no ventilation. Unfortunately, that includes restaurants, movie theaters, churches, schools, and bars.</li>
<li>You'll catch the virus if the concentration in the air is high enough and you are in the tainted air long enough. What the threshold concentration is, and how long you need to stay, are still being determined, but it seems like 10-15 minutes in an enclosed room with infected persons is enough. This <a href="https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them">post</a> by Erin Bromage in 2020 was informative at the time, and is still pretty close to what we know.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16K1OQkLD4BjgBdO8ePj6ytf-RpPMlJ6aXFg3PrIQBbQ/edit#gid=519189277">simple spreadsheet</a> by the University of Colorado does a fair job of putting numbers to the problem.</li>
<li>If you're outside, unless that singing person is really close to you, the Virus In and Virus Out terms are dominant, and the room volume is infinite. Transmission is really low, and you're safe.</li>
<li>If the sun is out, the generation term becomes negative because UV light breaks carbon-carbon bonds and kills the virus. So go to the beach, have fun, and try not to cough on each other.</li>
<li>All of this leads to the next topic, masks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Masks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone hates wearing masks. We are asked to wear them because...</li>
<li>...masks work <em>for a while</em>.</li>
<li>They work by slowing down the Virus Generated rate and by reducing the concentration of particles entering your nose. They don't stop the virus; they slow it down.</li>
<li>Let's take our infected singer ejecting 2000 particles per minute.  The air that passes through a quality mask will have 95 percent or better of the virus filtered. Some air will bypass the filter, but overall we could expect the singer to eject 100 particles per minute instead of 2000.</li>
<li>In addition, the ejected particles move much slower than if they were not slowed down by a filter. Less transport equals reduced chance for it to reach non-infected people. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6cTDGqcUpA">video</a> demonstrates it practically (but it's not perfect either).</li>
<li>Eventually, even with masks, the room will reach up to infection concentrations. Let's say up to 1,200 particles per cubic meter.</li>
<li>However, if you're wearing a mask, hopefully the filter will block about 95% of the virus particles.So you'll have 60 particles per cubic meter entering your nose, which should delay infection for a while. But not indefinitely.</li>
<li>It's not a binary 'Will Be Infected/Won't Be Infected' situation, it's a game of chance, and wearing masks improves our chances.</li>
<li>As I said, everyone hates wearing masks.  But they work. For a while.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virus Effects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The full hospitals in <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-preparing-for-third-wave-of-covid-19-uddhav-thackeray-announces-101620229754391.html">India</a>, <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/covid-19-variants-dominate-new-cases-but-no-peak-yet-in-turkey/news">Turkey</a>, and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/4/25/sanctions-battered-iran-faces-worst-coronavirus-wave">Iran</a> show what happens when the controls are ignored.</li>
<li>Everyone is aware of the mortality statistics for people under 65, but for countries with millions of people, 1.2% of the total is hundreds of thousands of hospital beds that aren't there for you if you have a heart attack.</li>
<li>If you are under 65 and get COVID, 999 times out of 1,000 you'll have a few days of serious illness, and then your immune system will win the internal battle and you'll recover.</li>
<li>If you recover, you have a 1 in 10 chance of prolonged symptoms, i.e. <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-information/covid-19-long-haulers.html">long COVID</a>. Luckily, these effects do not appear to be as bad as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-polio-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355669">polio</a>. This happens because even though the immune system was strong, it needed time to figure out how to conquer the virus and the virus did its damage before it was defeated.</li>
<li>The main point is the only reason why the US isn't like India is because of the controls, and now because of ...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vaccines</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone will get antibodies to COVID either by infection or vaccination.</li>
<li>Vaccines do one thing: Train your body to handle the virus should it arrive.</li>
<li>Mike Tyson said, "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."</li>
<li>Some people have a glass jaw when it comes to COVID. The vaccines are intended to be the sparring partner for your body before you enter the ring with Iron Mike. The difference is while the vaccine looks like Mike, his hands are covered with cotton and he can't hurt you. Your body learns the correct duck and move  sequences and the next thing you know, when the actual disease enters your body, Little Joe is holding the trophy at the end without being touched.</li>
<li>I'll leave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o65l1YAVaYc">others</a> to discuss the autism debate, let's go straight to what should be the real concern, how quickly they were made.</li>
<li>There is history of vaccines causing issues, specifically the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengvaxia_controversy">Dengue</a> vaccine.</li>
<li>Normally vaccines are released after at least 18 months of trials.</li>
<li>So when somebody says, "It's released too quickly!" I have to admit I understand the concern.</li>
<li>My personal opinion was to be 'aggressively second.' I have a health condition that makes me more vulnerable, so I was willing to wait until a few million people were inoculated.</li>
<li>And that's the main point...millions of people have been vaccinated with virtually no side effects (1 out of 1,000,000 for J&amp;J is virtually none).</li>
<li>So if someone says, "I'm concerned because the vaccine hasn't been well-demonstrated yet." I get it. Take your time, look for peer-reviewed studies and when you believe that the safety and efficacy are well demonstrated, please consider getting it because...</li>
<li>...others cannot be vaccinated. Organ transplant recipients, for example.</li>
<li>Many people who cannot be vaccinated are also vulnerable to COVID. Like me, they are 1 in 10 to 1 in 100 of potentially dying if infected. For that reason, I chose the risk of 1 out of a million for vaccine side effects compared to 1 in 100 for COVID death.</li>
<li>I'm also reducing the risk for other people because I won't transmit. You can also make that contribution to society. Even if your immune system can handle it, others cannot, but you sure can transmit it.</li>
<li>But if your reasons are some of the following, please take a longer look into the available information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Big Pharma</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>COVID vaccines and treatment are not in the <a href="https://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2020/pharmas-biggest-blockbusters/">top 10</a> of revenue, even in 2020. Yes, Moderna took off because it's their only product. But vaccine sales didn't even touch Pfizer's stock price.  Even if there are boosters needed (likely, again we are still learning), and this becomes a recurring revenue source, they would still prefer to be selling Humira and other drugs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Bill Gates</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Billionaires are a strange lot. Larry Ellison builds <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/04/sport/sailing-sailgp-larry-ellison-russell-coutts-launch-spt-intl/index.html">sailboats</a> and flies planes with his fortune. Mark Zuckerberg buys property in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-bought-more-land-kauai-hawaii-2021-5">Hawaii</a> (to be fair he does give to some charities). Bill Gates buys mosquito nets, literally cleans up people's <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/development/omniprocessor-from-poop-to-potable">shit</a>, and supports vaccine development. He gave money to help. The man isn't perfect, but he tried and is trying more than others, and he sure as hell doesn't want to put a chip in your brain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>The Media</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The media generates revenue by writing stories to scare you so you'll click and learn more (if it bleeds, it leads). Some media outlets will overstate the risk of COVID, some media outlets will overstate the role of government, but all of them have had the tendency to publish unverified information without sufficient fact checking.  Some do better than others though, if there are no references in the story, it is less likely to be true.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>The Government</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are many stories about the many wrong things government has done, and some of them are true. But I'm not seeing it with this, there were a lot of decisions made with imperfect information (see State of Science). In the final analysis the government's actions will probably earn a B to B+ grade.  Our hospitals never were full, like they are now in India, but there was a lot of economic damage that was the result of the controls.  I have family members that lost their jobs, and it sucks for them.</li>
<li>That being said, most of the politicians are still motivated by the numbers of people who will vote for them, and all of them seem to choose symbolism over substance.  Look for the substance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you made it this far, thanks. All I can say is that it's easy to be stuck in  your room, reading things on the internet and getting angry because your life that you've enjoyed was taken away.  I feel you. This last year has sucked. But if we get most of us vaccinated, if we wear masks while the rest of the population gets their antibodies, then finally this can be over. Like it was in 1920.</li>
<li>The sidebar to this sub encourages raising your standards. What I've posted here is as reasonable as I can find to the extent of my knowledge, and I think I've covered a lot of the open questions offered within these posts. If you are being truly skeptical, the information available (full hospitals in other countries, lack of transmission in masked environments, greatly reduced infections in nursing homes because of vaccinations) should indicate that masks and vaccines can get us back to the normal we had before.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck, stay healthy, and be careful.</p>

        <p>You laid out a lot of stuff in this post, and you presented it well with bullet points and correct spelling and punctuation.  You deserve credit for that I think.  I didn't read every word and didn't understand some of what I did read.  But you 'concluded' with:  "get most of us vaccinated, if we wear masks while the rest of the population gets their antibodies, then finally this can be over".  I'd like to point out, as many of us do repeatedly, that "this" is a virus that after well over a year more than 99.96% of us have survived.  Maybe it isn't 'over' per se, but it's insignificant compared to all of the downsides that the reaction to it has caused.  To me it's obvious that the restrictions <em>should</em> be over in that they have caused far more damage than the virus itself.  But then people bring up things other than the miniscule percentage of people who have died, and start talking about "Long Covid", such as you have.  In your post you say that: "there is still ignorance going around now" and I don't disagree, but "Long Covid", to this point as far as I ascertain, is speculative.  And we've gone through tons of 'speculative' measures, which change frequently, get rescinded etc. to the ludicrous policies like forcing people to wear a mask, except when they're eating.  There are many examples of things like that, and they are silly.  What <em>isn't</em> silly is people losing their businesses.  And people suffering from depression.  And children missing school.  And children being taught to fear other people because of a virus that in all likelihood will never affect them at all.  But you're suggesting we continue the charade, at the expense of all of that.  In other words, my viewpoint is that you suggest we keep doing the things that we know harm us, until hopefully one day the thing that <em>doesn't</em> harm the vast majority of us is gone.  But we don't know if that day will ever come.  What we <strong>know</strong> is that more than 99.96% of us have survived, and that the people who <em>have</em> died is by far exceeded by the people who have suffered negative consequences due to the restrictions.  What we <em>don't</em> know, is really much at all about "Long Covid" or what it <em>might</em> entail etc.  What we <em>do</em> know is that all of us will die one day, but probably not from C-19.</p>
<p>I say the cure is worse than the disease, and it's not even close.</p>

        <p>&rt;I'd like to point out, as many of us do repeatedly, that "this" is a virus that after well over a year more than 99.96% of us have survived.</p>
<p>We don't <em>know</em> 99.96% is correct. To the contrary really, if we use that number for the world population (1.00 - 0.9996) *7.64 billion = 3.05 million people. As that number has already died (3.2 million as of today, and that's with uncertain statistics), 0.04% is low.</p>
<p>Current infection fatality rate is about 1.5% worldwide for cases that were tested positive, it's probably on the order of 0.15% based on the 1 in 10 reporting estimates, or roughly 10 million people.</p>
<p>I already posted a link on long COVID, it's looking like at this time 2.5% of the people who were infected still have persistent symptoms.  That's not speculation.</p>
<p>Again, my point is all of the controls you're talking about could go away if everyone gets vaccinated. The approach you're offering is 'fail-open,' let everyone get infected and we'll bury those who don't make it.  The object of public health is find a solution for the public good and offer it.</p>
<p>Which is where we are now. If we all get the shots, we go back to normal. Not new normal, just normal. If we don't, the virus mutates and it may turn into something we cannot manage.</p>

        <p>&rt; We don't know 99.96% is correct</p>
<p>Actually, we do.  It's a higher number than that, after well over a year. It's math.  Plus, there's a ton of evidence that Covid deaths have been over counted, plus the governors of Michigan, California, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey forced nursing homes to admit Covid positive patients, plus there was over zealous use of ventilators early on......... and still, <em>more</em> than 99.96% of us have survived.</p>

        <p>Take the world's population, 7,640,000,000 and multiply by 0.0004 (which is 100%-99.96%) and you get 3,050,000 people. That's how many people would die if everyone caught covid and the 99.96% number was correct.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries">Worldometers</a> shows that 3,260,000 million people have already died, and that is not counting all of the uncounted people in India, Russia, and other countries. So your math is wrong, by a lot, because  your percentage is wrong.</p>
<p>Focus on America? Fine. 33,000,000 cases, and nearly 600,000 deaths. That is 1.8% of all people that were detected cases died. They assume that about 10 cases for every case reported is unreported. That drops it to about 0.18%, or roughly 1 out of 500. </p>
<p>To close, if we all get vaccinated, we won't have to worry about this. If you are healthy, for the good of the people around you, get your jabs.</p>

        <p>You're saying I'm wrong because 3.26 million is "a lot" different than 3.05 million.  Lol.  Of course deaths will continue to rise, you didn't expect otherwise did you?  Yet, somehow, someway, the global population continues to rise.  And it's rising faster than deaths from Covid, so the percentage will only decrease as time goes on.</p>

        <p>From what I have read (sorry, I don't have a link handy), approx 10% of covid survivors will develop symptoms that last more than a few weeks after recovery.  Of those, approximately 10% have not recovered yet.</p>

        <p>Those are good questions.</p>
<p>\&rt;Why did you use when and not if?</p>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is I tend to view vaccinations from a perspective similar to Penn and Teller's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhk7-5eBCrs">Bullshit</a> <a href="https://episode.No">episode</a>. No rational comparison of the potential side effects of vaccines can compare to the benefits they've given society. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1042370/united-states-all-time-infant-mortality-rate/">Infant mortality</a> dropped because of vaccines. I assume anyone making it that far into that wall of text would have to see that.</li>
<li>Like you said, some places and services will require it. We already need vaccinations for schools, considering how pernicious this virus is, public spaces will require it because of government, and private spaces will not want the bad press of cases.</li>
</ol>
<p>\&rt;Also, after doing what you suggest, I still don’t want a vaccine (despite doing everything else I’m asked) what then?</p>
<p>That's your decision. Private enterprises may make decisions to limit their risk and liability, as will the public spaces. We can't smoke inside public buildings anymore for comparable reasons.</p>
<p>\&rt;Also, how will I live if I’m barred from certain services, lose job, can’t renew licenses etc while I’m “taking my time”?</p>
<p>I don't know. I can speculate. At some point they will no longer declare the vaccines as Emergency Use. By then, I suspect that vaccination will be needed for many public gatherings and services. Maybe they'll find a workaround (like you need to wear a mask).</p>
<p>The thing is, without vaccination any of us has the potential to inadvertently kill someone who couldn't be vaccinated just by breathing. But because of amazing medical technologies, if you get two shots (or one) that bother you for a day, and then you can finally breathe without a mask in most situations.</p>

        <p>I understand 1) but that is JUST your opinion I’m afraid. I’m not completely against them, I know about Edward Jenner. But also hygiene, cleanliness, diet, understanding exercise more, housing etc have all contributed too. Also, your last sentence has a whiff of arrogance. Don’t start and remain civil</p>
<p>2) Those vaccines were developed over a long time yes? Also, that ‘pernicious’ is very much open for debate. The survival rate for people without underlying health problems is fucking amazing ( and the statistics are manipulated for older people anyway; I had a great aunt die recently and COVID was put on her death certificate- she didn’t die of COVID)</p>
<p>I don’t agree with the smoking analogy. I currently test myself twice a week, I wash my hands, stay fit and healthy, eat right. I probably had Covid and was asymptomatic. If I got it now I would quarantine. 
So with no evidence that I have it I would be barred because of my moral choices? How the fuck does that sound anywhere near acceptable?</p>
<p>And I’m sorry but your last point just completely loses me 🤷‍♂️Yes we do all have the potential to kill someone inadvertently. Pollution, global warming,accidents, ignorance over allergies, fucking throwing a stone of a cliff etc</p>
<p>Fundamentally I believe in liberty over security and I would hope, whether you want this vaccination or not, you would respect and stand with me if a society of segregation emerged because of this.</p>

        <p>&rt;Fundamentally I believe in liberty over security and I would hope, whether you want this vaccination or not, you would respect and stand with me if a society of segregation emerged because of this.</p>
<p>I'll start with this one first, because it is an interesting point. Your declaration of liberty is that you choose not to be vaccinated. That allows you to stay within your personal space and do your own things because those are the areas of your domain. The moment you step into public spaces, all domains of liberty overlap and your philosophical position by default recognizes other people's choices in liberty.  Their choices involved taking an accepted medication that renders a disease inert that has been shown to kill people (again, see India's makeshift  crematoria if you don't believe this is happening), and there are people who cannot take the medication. Does your right to liberty, a healthy person who declines a vaccine and allows themself to be susceptible to potential infection, exceed an unhealthy person's liberty who has no choice? Also does your right in liberty supercede a property owner who does not want infections tied to their establishment? Or a person who is riding a bus to go to work? Liberty rights collide in public health, and it will not favor the individual.  So asking me if I would stand with you or the rest of the public is a difficult question, you have a choice, others do not.</p>
<p>&rt;So with no evidence that I have it I would be barred because of my moral choices? How the fuck does that sound anywhere near acceptable?</p>
<p>You're asking for the testing infrastructure to remain in place. That is evidence you don't have it. If you were willing to pay for it, use it as prescribed, and it was shown to be efficacious, I'd personally be fine with that. What the public and private parties would choose may be different. </p>
<p>It may go that way. But I do think it's acceptable to prevent people who are infected from entering any public space. </p>
<p>&rt;And I’m sorry but your last point just completely loses me 🤷‍♂️Yes we do all have the potential to kill someone inadvertently. Pollution, global warming,accidents, ignorance over allergies, fucking throwing a stone of a cliff etc</p>
<p>Pollution, global warming are a result of the global economy; accidents by definition are 'no fault,' ignorance over allergies, you can be <a href="https://www.hgsklawyers.com/news/2020/03/sue-restaurant-food-allergy/amp/">sued</a> for that. <a href="https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/throwing-an-object-off-an-overpass-is-it-illegal-50639">Throwing a stone</a> has had several people sent to jail. If you get infected even though you could have avoided it, legally there may be a case for negligent homicide.  I leave that for the lawyers to figure out.</p>
<p>And if I can ask you a serious question: If you're healthy, believe in the usefulness of vaccines, why would you be more willing to risk a disease that is still new and shown to potentially cause permanent lung damage or death as opposed to a weakened virus (J&amp;J, AZ) that is known to not cause those problems?  I can understand hesitation on mRNA, even though I got it.</p>

        <p>Because if you read actual science instead of conspiracy theories and you have any level of scientific literacy you will come to the conclusion that the vaccines are safe and effective.</p>

        <p>Some things simply cannot be rushed with our current level of technology.  240 people can't have a baby overnight.  A drug unlike any other of its kind in history cannot be proven or reasonably conjectured to have no long term side effects without simply waiting.  Most obviously, we won't know if fertility or fetal development has been affected until at least 9 months after a significant number of people have received the shot.</p>

        <p>Can you define actual science please because I keep seeing this term thrown around. Is actual science ‘masks are useless and ineffective’ or is actual science ‘you must lockdown everything’ ?</p>

        <p>Just a mild point, but I believe all transplant recipients are being encouraged to take the vaccine. I have a friend with a transplanted kidney who's had it.</p>

        <p>I think you are right. I saw a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777685">study</a> that suggested less efficacy, but it looks like <a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/covid-19/covid-19-vaccines-and-transplant-patients-is-it-safe">doctors</a> are recommending vaccines for transplant. Thanks.</p>
