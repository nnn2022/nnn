    <strong>"Go ahead, call the cops...."</strong>
    <p><p>Hot day yesterday. We stopped at a convenience store for a bottle of cold water for our dog. Husband ran in and got the water and proceeded to the register. Cashier goes, "Sir, I cannot serve you. You need to put on a mask." "No, no one told me to at the door on my way in. Let me just pay for this and leave." "No, sir, you have to put on a mask." "Listen, go ahead, call the cops, the fire department, whoever you want. Your store is going to be fined, not me. I'll go ahead and put the cash on the counter. You have cameras outside, you know what I drive and my license plates. By the time you make that call, I'll be on my way. How will you explain to your boss that you called out the authorities and are now being fined for wasting a cop's time? How will you explain that?" The cashier just stared and let him pay.  You CAN push back on these bastards. DO IT!!!!!!</p></p>

        <p>Yep. I was at Walmart a few months ago near the beginning of this bullshit and my total was around $13. I put in a $20 bill. (I was at self checkout) The machine then said “error-please insert card” and kind of glitched out. My total still says I owe the $13. So I call over a worker to open the machine and see if my bill was jammed or something. She opens the machine AND LO AND BEHOLD THERES NO CASH INSIDE IT! Proceeds to ask me if I put money in it. I say, yes, I put in a 20$ bill. At this point she’s looking like she doesn’t believe I put any money in it so the manager comes over. She says hmm that’s weird. Try putting your card in. To which I respond, I didn’t want to pay with card, hence why I put the 20$ bill in. So she says “it’s weird it just likes to have a card input and it usually makes the machine work” so at this point I put my chip in, and it registers that the $20 bill was inserted, and starts giving me change. I don’t know if there’s a “conspiracy” behind this, but now that 20$ bill and transaction are now logged with my debit card. It’s almost as if it wouldn’t let me proceed paying with cash unless it had a “name” or “chip” to pin it to. Scary times we are coming to, as of now most stores in my area don’t accept cash, and won’t give you any cash back either. And are asking you to round up for “donations” my ass.</p>

        <p>Would make sense I walmart would install Tap on their damn debit machines! They got brand new ones where I live and you still can't Tap your card. Not sure how prevalent Tap is in the states but almost everyone has it in Canada, no one is forcing us to use it either we just have stupid papers up saying "please pay with a card if possible", it's for security theater, no one here only accepts cards. Customers know the cashier will sanitize their hands after getting cash anyway. Something funky seems to be going on in the USA.</p>

        <p>I don't think that it's intentional, either.  It's a follow-on effect from other things.  The coins aren't missing, nor were they intentionally withdrawn.  Rather, people just aren't circulating them like they normally would, because they're afraid of the Rona.</p>

<p>If businesses adopt unreasonable practices that provide customers with an unreasonable burden as the cost of doing business, passing a law isn't just something the governments can do, it is something that governments should do.</p>

        <p>&rt;While in turn we have to recognize that a business has the right to refuse service to anyone for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Absolute nonsense, and again, you know it. I've already told you why it's nonsense, and now you're doubling down on a point that you know has been debunked. You know better.</p>
<p>The civil rights laws put many limitations on the freedom of business to do that, and have been doing so for longer than most of us have been alive. A store owner who refused to allow a customer to enter until the customer converted to the religion of the owner's choice,  or left his interracial marriage would be cracked down on, quickly.  If he were to tell a customer that she had to have sex with him to enter, he'd be guilty of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>This claim that "privately owned businesses" can do whatever they want is an absolute whopper of a lie. It's not just a mistake, it's an exercise in deliberate dishonesty. It's simply impossible for somebody to grow up on this planet, and not know that businesses can be (and are) regulated.</p>
<p>&rt;I myself am not for the mask mandates </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm inclined to distrust you as you say that, first of all because you've shown yourself to be dishonest by repeating a point that you already know to be invalid. Also, I have heard the name "Saul Alinsky" before. Rules for Radicals?</p>
<p>I've also heard of concern trolling.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; just curious why the aggression towards small business owners who are  already struggling to stay open because of these stupid mandates </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Who, in this discussion, said anything about small businesses? The OP mentioned a convenience store. Every convenience store I've ever seen has been part of a huge chain like 711. </p>
<p>The businesses that have been allowed to stay open during the lockdowns have been the large ones, so when you attempt to portray this as a war being waged on small business, you're being dishonest. Again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; So it was answered in another thread, why wear a shirt or shoes in a store? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You're seriously comparing wearing a mask to wearing a shirt and shoes? I have yet to hear about a person who had trouble breathing because he wore a shirt and shoes. People who've had trouble breathing because of the masks are easily found.</p>
<p>Asthma, bronchitis, and rhinitis (all of these aggravated by black mold exposure) are things that create added difficulty for me when I am forced to mask up in order to buy food, but even people with un-impaired breathing have reported problems with the masks, and I'm not surprised.</p>
<p>Despite the nonsense posted to the contrary on this subject, surgical masks were never designed with all day use in mind. The people for whom they were intended (surgeons) work briefly, in operating rooms that are kept cold, at higher pressure, with dust filtered and oxygen enriched air. Surgery is noteworthy for the lack of physical exertion involved in it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If you felt it was a violation, why bother? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because, as I've already pointed out, the need to eat isn't something that we can really opt out of.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Dialogue for people’s anger on having to wear a mask in a private establishment </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>People are being robbed of their breath and their personal dignity, for the sake of a policy based on junk science, and you want to have a "dialog" about why they're angry? No, I think that you're a dishonest person who wants to manipulate them into going along with what you want.</p>
<p>You have already demonstrated your lack of integrity in this discussion, so my distrust of you does not come out of thin air.</p>

        <p>&rt;A few years back the left was crying about the whole Gay Wedding cake debacle, and the best defense for that is that it is up to the owner’s personal business rights and freedom to operate his or her business as they see fit.</p>
<p>So, you want everybody slowly suffocating in order to buy groceries, forevermore (except for those of us with asthma whose lives might end up getting cut short by this) just so that gay couples can go on having trouble getting wedding cakes? Interesting set of priorities you have there. Not sure why you hate gay people <em>that much</em>, or really, at all.</p>
<p>That much having been said, you've made a strange comparison. The man in Colorado who refused to bake the cake in the case to which you alluded was acting on his own personal prejudices. The gay couple he treated like dirt could have taken their business elsewhere, and have had an excellent chance of finding a baker who would have made a cake for them. Even if they couldn't, because every single baker in their area set policy in lock step with every other baker, they could (in principle) make their own. Even without a cake, they could still get married. Even without getting married, they could still go on living.</p>
<p>Not that I'm saying that they should have had to, but let take a look at the relative levels of coercion involved, and the consequences of that coercion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Covid masking - Those policies being seen at the "private businesses" in question, not because individual businesses chose to do so, but because governors (acting with willful and wanton disregard for constitutional limitations on their power) imposed mask orders by executive order, and kept those unconstitutional mask orders in place until they became part of the status quo. There is nothing spontaneous about the adoption of those policies by "private businesses" at all.</p>
<p>Because of the manner in which these policies arose, where they are found, they are universal (or nearly so). A customer who is unhappy with the masking policies can not reasonably be expected to find a business which does not impose them because of the executive orders which the governors lawlessly imposed. Unlike the gay couple in Colorado which wanted a cake from that specific baker, somebody looking for food in a place like Chicago can't just go shop in another store.</p>
<p>The gay couple could (in the highly unlikely case of not being able to find a baker) have baked its own cake. A city dweller, realistically speaking can not grow his own food.</p>
<p>The gay couple could live (and even get married) without having anybody bake a cake for them, or even without having a cake. But if a city dweller can not find food to buy, he will slowly die of starvation. In fact, even if he manages to instantly transport himself to the countryside and is given a plot of land, and the seeds to plant on it, he'll still starve, because crops take time to grow.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This leaves you seriously trying to compare the hardship faced by somebody who is starving to death with that faced by somebody who won't get the wedding cake design of his choice. Seriously, give me a break. That's an apples and oranges comparison, and you know it.</p>
<p>Further, in the case of the masking policies, we're looking at a problem that a customer can not avoid by taking his business elsewhere, because of what the government chose to do. It's a cliché for a reason: "you broke it, you bought." Having created the problem in the first place, the government has a duty to fix it. Therefore, the states do not merely the right to provide customers with legislative relief in this matter, ethically speaking, they a duty to do so.</p>

<p>"I feel bad for the small businesses" is not the same as a recognition that the people forced to wear the masks are being imposed on. A recognition, I might add, that you tried to wriggle out of by making an absurd comparison between the wedding cake case and grocery store mask mandates.</p>
<p>See reply above for that was an absurd comparison.</p>

<p>You're going to try to change the clear meaning of your own words by making reference to posts from a few years ago? Classy.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, after posting a certain amount of BS, engaging in character assassination at my expense while pretending to defend yourself from the same, you just sort of slip in that pro-masking talking point and hope it doesn't get noticed too much?</p>
<p>You're a shady, disreputable human being, and we're done having this dialog. To have a straightforward conversation with somebody like you would obviously be an impossibility, so this is where I block you. But in parting, I will thank you for one thing - you've helped demonstrate the truth of something I've been saying all along.</p>
<p>The lockdowns and mask order have far more to do with troll culture than they ever did with Science. The panic arose in social media as a result of the efforts of people who were out for the lulz, not out of any genuine desire to save lives.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>

        <p>What about when the mask sign is put there due to pressure from the government or to ameliorate the minority of people who will screech if it's not there?</p>
<p>I've been in multiple stores (traditionally masculine places like auto parts and heavy equipment) where they have signs plastered on the doors but no one inside is wearing a mask or caring at all.  The sign just means that someone in corporate is a mask nazi, or they're just covering their ass.</p>

        <p>&rt;The government shouldn’t be mandating anything like this, but we should respect the freedom to allow businesses to practice how they would.</p>
<p>In virtually every place I'm aware of, they make provisions for valid exemptions.  So, I do agree that businesses have the right to create certain standards for whom they choose to serve.  However, I would say that these standards become virtually unenforceable in practice.</p>
<p>If you say, "I am exempt", that business has no way to compel your private health information, not to mention that a valid exemption includes mental distress, which is so far beyond the bounds of provability even with medical records that it's basically worthless.</p>
<p>Your claim of an exemption cannot be disputed, nor can the policy guaranteeing said exemption be removed (because no business is permitted to discriminate on the basis of disability).  Is what I've just written cheeky?  Yeah, probably.  But, bad policy is not my problem.  I'll let our dopey legislators and HR departments sort through their mess and their contradictions.</p>
<p>P.S. Not down-voting you because I think the discussion is worth visibility.</p>

        <p>That makes sense, that’s where consumer rights would trump business operators rights to a point. 
Of course the only thing that would allow the business owner to counteract would be the right to refuse service to anyone.</p>
<p>I appreciate it, discussions like this will allow us to answer those who would compel us to violate our own rights.
But of course the average redditor takes a question like this as offensive or a threat.</p>

        <p>Yes, actually, you should. Businesses are not black zones where your rights magically no longer apply. They don't get to dictate to you what you wear or do outside of the confines of the law. In principle, you should be able to walk into a party store butt-ass naked, buy your shit and walk out with no one saying anything (I have no idea if full nudity is covered under the first amendment, YMMV).</p>
<p>Businesses aren't holy entities for whom laws and right don't apply. Rights are guiding principles of basic human interaction, they're not meant to only regulate governments, and until the rest of the world sees that, shit like lockdowns will continue to happen and we will never be able to move forward.</p>

<p>No you can't, you have to actually have a good reason to boot someone off of your premises if you're open to the public (which as a fast food restaurant, you are), there's case law protecting protected groups from discrimination specifically to stop nazis like you from deciding who as access to stuff like food and who does not. </p>
<p>There's a reason a lot of the anti-lockdown cases that go to court result in victory for our side -- because everybody know s that this crap is illegal and unconstitutional, and you know it too.</p>
<p>Sorry but free speech doesn't just go away just because you don't like it and that store owner has to accept that fact just like everybody else. You aren't special because you're an aggressive mask Nazi. You're just one of the people that I, personally, ignore when out and about.</p>

        <p>Every state has long had some form of law, restricting public indecency. Violating those laws is what usually will put someone on the sex offender list. There are places (nude beaches) that had to be DESIGNATED spaces where the public can be informed of the zones so that each individual can make the choice of if they want to participate. </p>
<p>The topless case you’re referring to is another example where the default is a ban on public nudity, but someone sued for the right to no longer consider women’s breasts under the indecent exposure laws. Six states ended up adopting this into their laws last year. </p>
<p>I apologize for coming off like a bully, I absolutely did. I want to encourage some more self-awareness. I just mean in general too; despite any personal opinions. What right is that for me to have? None and I’m aware of that.</p>
<p>To be honest though, I find this a completely valid use of my time. 😀</p>

        <p>I think those are definitely discussions to be had.</p>
<p>It goes both ways though. You may have a right as a business to insist that people wear a mask, as an example. I reserve the right as the customer to take my business elsewhere. Both of those things, at the surface, sound reasonable.</p>
<p>Where it gets crazy is mostly with the government mandating entire populations to do things, with little to no factual scientific basis.</p>

        <p>You’re right the government shouldn’t be mandating things for other people’s safety. If I spread corona to somebody that’s their problem not mine. That’s why I think the laws against drunk driving are bullshit. It’s my vehicle, I pay taxes for the roads so I should be able to get wasted and drive. It takes away my freedom to do so.</p>

        <p>You are free to do anything as long as you are not infringe on my freedom (Thats the actual definition btw). Meaning, you cant enter my personal space, you cant hurt me etc etc. And that means if I get sick because of you not wearing a mask, you are infringing on my freedom and your freedom will be taken away from you. This has been the law since freedom existed.
Its actually funny to me that you are on this planet for maybe 80 years and even if covid takes 3 years to Deal with you cant take 3 years out of the 80 and simply not be a total douche in these 3 years ..</p>

<p>Re: masks - So...if the mask I'm wearing isn't protecting me...and the mask you're wearing isn't protecting you...</p>
<p>I appreciate that minds are hard to change, but this really only spells out that masks don't do anything.  And data from all over the world is now indicating this.  Case rates (which is an irrelevant measurement anyway) continue to climb despite mandatory mask requirements.</p>
<p>Masks do nothing to stop the spread of a virus that has little effect on the population anyway.</p>

        <p>Common sense is to wear a mask because may or may not protect people around you and since I am decent human being I wear a mask even tho its uncomfortable because my own comfort is less important than even strangers around me.</p>

        <p>shit... you’re right! let me rephrase: you’re a straight up dumbass if you are literally presented with scientific evidence that wearing masks GREATLY reduces the spread of a disease that you BREATHE IN, and continue to put others and yourself in danger of spreading/contracting it. I would link an article (or tens of them) from trusted sources and disease experts, but you will counter it with your shit logic. </p>

        <p>No. Its literally with everything. I dont yell at waitresses because they got my order wrong, I dont bump into people on the Train/bus, I dont skip in line, i meet people half way when dealing with something and I wear a mask. All that because I am decent human and not garbage rat.</p>

        <p>I hear ya, Captain Sanctimonious. I would just like to point out that most ppl do those things - not skipping lines, berating waitresses - and you are not special for doing any of those things, like you seem to feel. Lastly, you are definitely not better than anyone else because you choose to wear a mask that is ineffective and pointless and someone else does not.  You reek of self-righteousness and that is garbage rat material.</p>

<li>I never said I am special. I am saying I am better than YOU, which I obviously am and not only for wearing a mask</li>
<li>Maks are effective, every single country that forced countrywide mask wearing was out of covid by summe and the second they lifted those laws they are back at it again. Masks, not going outside and good hygiene made covid go away in literally weeks. In America you never had such laws and look at you, literally the worst numbers from any country ever.</li>

        <p>It is not that simple. If there was something I could do to truly save lives from a pandemic I would do it, most of the people on this sub would as well. </p>
<p>The difference is that we KNOW that is not the reason they are mandating masks. That is why we protest it. Not because it's uncomfortable. We are human too, we are just aware that this mask policy is about COMPLIANCE, not health. </p>
<p>They are arresting people, fining them, harassing them for not wearing face coverings in public. The people mandating this do not have the public interest at heart. I wish we could all figure this out. Maybe one day.</p>

        <p>Willing to bet you just discovered the word simp like every other jabroni and now you feel power when you use it. And hive mind? There’s a fucking pandemic, I’m not fucking losing my mind over it but at the same time be courteous and thoughtful of others. People bitch and complain about hive mind yet I’m sure you follow other laws such as no drinking and driving, or texting while driving or do you do as you please since you don’t want to be “hive minded”.</p>

        <p>Oh just like you discovered the word Karen? ..</p>
<p>The only true difference between the two camps right now is that we KNOW that mandating masks is not about anyone's health. They are being mandated to usher in compliance.</p>
<p>People are being legit fined because their face covering's are not on properly. They are being arrested and harassed for not wearing one walking down the street. Don't you see what is going on here? What this will lead to? The people mandating this DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. Quite the opposite. </p>
<p>I guarantee that I personally, give more of a shit about you than anyone in power legislating face coverings. Do you think we make such a damn fuss for the fun of it? Because we're all Trumptards? It's not that simple. I just wish people could see through this. Oh well. It will only get worse really. Everyone will have to make their choice of where they stand. </p>
<p>Wish you luck.</p>

        <p>Karen has BEEN a meme for a while but morons like you only catch on when things get hyped. And if you hate it so much I’ll repeat the infamous Karen’s favorite saying, JUST COMPLY LMAO. You don’t want to be fined wear your shit properly. The ones who don’t care about anyone are the ones living as if we didn’t just lose 200,000 lives with 7 million cases still ongoing, the ones not wearing masks defending obvious ignorance just pleading their sob stories to get around simply wearing a face covering. Have a great day my guy.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Retail workers, restaurant workers and otherwise did not ask for the job of being the mask police. They were unjustly given the duty. Getting a small win against them doesnt change the stupid rules. It just makes their day more difficult. The people who put these rules in place are the ones who need to be harrassed about it.</p>

<p>I'm an asthmatic. It's a legally recognized disability. Disabled people are a protected group. But nice try. While I am schooling you, I would like to introduce you to this passage from the CDC guidelines on mask usage</p>

<p>"Masks should NOT be worn by children under the age of 2 or <strong><em>anyone who has trouble breathing</em></strong>, is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance."</p>
<p>relevant passage set in bold and italicized for your convenience. I made sure to save it in the Webpage and Internet archives.</p>

        <p>Really, u/neox29's non sequitur response was reason enough for a blocking on the spot, but I felt like playing with him for a little bit. Let's remember what I was replying to, when I posted the comment he replied to. Namely, this comment:</p>
<p>"If the store says that you aren't allowed to wear your pants in there,  then you don't get to waltz in with pants on and demand service."</p>
<p>Sorry, no. If you're running a store, you do not have a legal right to order your customers to do a strip tease at the entrance. At least not in the US.</p>

        <p>You do, actually. It's entirely legal to give an order to anybody inside of your store to take their cloths off, provided that you don't go into the boundaries of sexual assault and whatnot. Given that the original comment clearly wasn't giving his example with that in mind, we'll just discount that thought for now.</p>
<p>The customers don't, however, have to conform to this order. They can refuse it all they want, and just as they can refuse to obey the store's orders, the store can refuse to obey the customer's order to purchase goods, or even to enter the store.</p>
<p>Where the exceptions apply are to those under a protected class, like race, sex, medical conditions and whatnot, but even that, that doesn't mean that they're just entirely exempt from the rule, it just means that reasonable accommodations have to be made to prevent discrimination. </p>
<p>If somebody has a valid reason for the rule of "No wheelchairs inside", that doesn't mean that somebody with a wheelchair can just go in anyways because a rule like that is discriminatory, it means that, unless the store wants to be fined, they have to provide a reasonable accommodation, like bringing groceries outside, having somebody shop for you, providing crutches, something like that.</p>

        <p>I'm reminded of the saying "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing."</p>
<p>Sorry, u/RandomJew567, but you just aren't as smart as you think you are. You're failing to understand that there are laws other than the civil rights laws. There are also laws against sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Bosses and business owners have not been free to say "put out or get out" for a long time. One doesn't have to belong to a protected class in order to file a sexual harassment complaint and make it stick. A demand to undress would be seen as sexual harassment; the nudity extorted out of the customer in this manner would be seen as being sexual, in and of itself. </p>
<p>If you doubt this, go find a lawyer and ask. Which, by the way, is exactly what I did.</p>
<p>This discussion is now over. I've just wasted an hour dealing with one clueless individual, and I don't have time for another. Blocking you.</p>

        <p>So this guy blocked me, but to anybody else viewing the comment, he's entirely missed my point. If he had actually read my comment instead of just...not read my comment, he would have seen that I specifically highlighted that, since it was clear OP wasn't trying to delve into the realms of sexual harassment and the such, I discounted it.</p>
<p>I never claimed that yelling at somebody to take their pants off wasn't sexual harassment. The example OP gave could be used interchangeably with a jacket, or with close toed shoes, or with gloves, or with basically any clothing item. The fact that it's pants isn't pertinent to the topic at hand, so while yes, ordering somebody to take off their pants would be, in many situations, sexual harassment, that fact isn't relevant to the discussion being that businesses can mandate pretty much whatever they want. </p>
<p>This guy's argument is basically that, due to the specific circumstance where a business can't order somebody to take off their pants due to sexual harassment, business can't mandate any clothing items whatsoever, which is pretty silly, as not every clothing item has sexual connotations to them.</p>

<p>Holy crap the irony is palpable.  Here you are complaining about how a business wants to behave, but they are 100% within their rights to throw you out for being a health risk, which you are.  They have a right to refuse service to you sweetheart, just like you would have the same right to refuse service to customers if you provided any sort of benefit to society.  I honestly imagine you smell like rotten flesh from the gradual disintegration of what in others would be considered a brain.</p>

        <p>Note the link above to the CDC website, and the quote from the CDC's guidelines. You remember - the CDC, the very organization that issued the mask guidelines, in the first place. So, are they an authoritative source or are they not? Which is it?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Holy crap the irony is palpable.   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do you even know what that word means?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Here you are complaining about how a business wants to behave, but they  are 100% within their rights to throw you out for being a health risk,  which you are. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Apparently, you do not. Hard as this might be for you to understand, asthma isn't a choice. It's a condition, one that I can not opt out of, any more than I can opt out of having chronic bronchitis, rhinitis, or the lingering effects of that black mold exposure. Asthma is a condition that is dangerously aggravated by mask wearing, which is why the CDC issued that exemption, the one that you are now ignorantly dismissing.</p>
<p>As for the alleged danger I would pose to the rest of people in the store, that is a counterfactual assertion. Covid-19, from the beginning, has been known to pose little risk to those without any of a well known list of risk factors (being very old, being immuno-compromised, or being obese, with being too young for one's immune system to have properly developed having been hypothesized as being a possible fourth risk factor). The lockdown was never put in place to protect the mostly 20-40 something doomers who the rest of us constantly get to hear from, and who comprise the vast majority of shopper. Great age, in this case, means over 80, not over 50.</p>
<p>Your loud ignorance to the contrary notwithstanding, the lockdowns and mask policies were put in place to protect the vulnerable people with the risk factors mentioned, not the neurotic millennials who are convinced that they are doomed every time somebody sneezes nearby. The plan was to reduce the spread of Covid-19 by asymptomatic carriers. The plan was based, not on empirical data, but on a mathematical model constructed by a high school student, based on rates of infection and transmission which were plucked out of thin air, based on no data at all. When the WHO (World Health Organization) finally did collect data, and found that it did not support the view that asymptotic transmission was common, at all</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html</a></p>
<p>undermining the entire theoretical basis for the lockdown, the mobs on various social media sites (Twitter and Reddit in particular) responded to this by bullying the scientists at the WHO into recanting. But facts do not cease to be facts, just because a pack of bullies don't want others to hear them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&rt; They have a right to refuse service to you sweetheart, just like you  would have the same right to refuse service to customers if you provided  any sort of benefit to society. </p>

<p>Your views regarding the disabled would have rightly been considered backward, even during the Middle Ages. The fact that I have trouble breathing might keep me out of athletics, but it most certainly hasn't kept me from getting degrees in Mathematics (currently MS, and ABD status for a PhD, currently toward the end of writing my thesis), Physics and the coursework for an MS in Electrical Engineering. I currently tutor college students in Mathematics, having four years of college teaching experience in said subject, and will be an engineer at graduation.</p>
<p>You, on the other hand, are an Internet loudmouth who managed to put a drill bit into his own leg while at work.</p>

<p>Well done, I guess.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I honestly imagine you smell like rotten flesh from the gradual disintegration of what in others would be considered a brain. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do the words Dunning-Kruger Effect mean anything to you?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&rt; You're a moron who wants to be smarter than the smart people based on your own say so. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Your lack of self-awareness amuses me slightly more than it annoys me. The person who dreamed up the mathematical model in use was a high school student. I'm a PhD candidate in Mathematics, specializing in Probability, who has studied Statistics at the graduate school level. At this point, I have former students who have former students who have students who would be more qualified to built mathematical models than that little girl would have been. As for you, you're an incompetent day laborer who thinks that he is ready to take part in discussions about scientific matters because he is loud and belligerent.</p>
<p>When I find myself outside of my areas of expertise, I find people who I know to be experts and talk to them. You, on the other hand, go along with whatever the equally loud people have to say on the Internet, and think that's learning. Seriously, have you ever been to College? Did you even finish High School? </p>
<p>There are a number of physicians (two of them with a long history of doing medical research themselves) in my immediate family (along with a biologist) to whom I can and do pose questions, meaning that as I go looking for sources, I have the guidance of actual MDs and PhDs. Your information comes from GED recipients who spent their days playing videogames.</p>
<p>Do you begin to understand the difference?</p>
<p>When I run the narrative we've been getting out of your crowd past these actual MDs, they fall over laughing at the absurdity of it. You guys pour on more BS by the day, according to them, which would be funny, were it not so destructive.</p>
<p>Now tell me, Mr. Cramden, where did you get the idea that as somebody who works a drill, that you knew more about medicine than did physicians, and more about mathematical modeling than a mathematician? Where do you get the confident believe that you are one of the smart kids, when you're doing a job that requires no great amount of intelligence, and doing it badly?</p>
<p>I'll admit to being a little curious about that, but not so curious as to be willing to go on talking to somebody like you. Besides which, I think we all know the answer to that question, already. You're a moron who wants to be smarter than the smart people based on your own say so. </p>

<p>Each day I come home from the store, I am more short of breath than I was the day before. When I am forced to mask up, in violation of CDC guidelines which you can read for yourself (assuming you can read), I am left doing slow, progressive damage to my own lungs. I am forced to do so, in violation of the law, because of poorly thought out, unnecessary policies put in place to appease loud ignoramuses like you, who don't care how much harm they do to others, as long as they can get heard.</p>
<p>You're a drillbit operator who is helping to slowly kill others, just because you're having fun playing scientist. The government is denying others to act on real health concerns, just to please people like you. Yes, that's oppression. Being forced to choose between slow asphyxiation (and lung damage that might or might heal someday) and slow starvation, just because Ralph Cramden wants to think that he's Albert Einstein, is oppressive.</p>
<p>Of course, you already know this much, as much as you'll deny it, because that's the whole idea. We've all met people like you, and know the type - you're the schoolyard bully who never outgrew his old role. Politics just gave you a chance to go back to your old ways. Including abusing a disabled person for being disabled. I'll bet that makes you feel really proud of yourself.</p>
<p>The good news is that this isn't a school playground, it's the Internet. I don't have to wait for you to have an epiphany you'll never gave, I can just block you and forget that you ever existed. B'bye. We're done.</p>

        <p>I kinda support this but at the same time, we checkout workers are just doing our jobs and it’s really hard when this happens. If I had personally made the rules, I would understand rage directed at me, but since I didn’t and am just mandated by the store to follow them, it’s hurtful when this happens. Please just consider maybe pulling up your shirt to cover your mouth and nose or something other than screaming at an underpaid checkout worker. Please?</p>

        <p>The store is privately owned. They make up the rules. If they want a store where you can shop only naked they are free to do so. Their rule right now is you need to have a mask. Nobody is going to fine private business for enforcing THEIR rules.. Nothing in your local walmart is so urgent he had to “run” to .. cold water is not life and death situation, covid for some is, wear a mask.</p>
<p>Edit: your husband made a scene and probably yelled at a young cashier who didnt make the rules, she is enforcing them. How dumb are you.</p>

        <p>I'm not really sure that was verbal abuse. And to be fair, its just as bad to use your position as a minimum wage cashier to exert power over someone over something you clearly didn't care enough about to mention when they entered the store.</p>

        <p>When I was a cashier I didn't give a shit about someone using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy some chips and soda, but I still had to check every time because my boss told me to. Take it up with management, corporate, or even the local government that's forcing these stupid mask mandates on businesses, not some poor cashier stuck with the shitty job of enforcing them.</p>

        <p>How the hell are people downvoting you. I completely agree. My mother works at a grocery store and had a woman yell at her because of supposedly ‘high’ prices. Like it’s not the cashiers choice, it’s the rules. Some people are really rude to cashiers</p>

        <p>If you're against masks, sure, that's your opinion, and that's fine. I'm not really looking for an argument here, but this sort of behavior really shouldn't be endowed by, well, anybody. </p>
<p>A store has the right to refuse service for pretty much any reason, except stuff like protected classes. Not wanting to wear a mask isn't a protected class. Neither the store employee nor the store would be fined for calling the police, and provided that the customer didn't leave when asked by somebody representative of the owner's wishes, they would probably be escorted off the premises by them, as at that point, they would be trespassing. Whether or not the employee would be willing to go through the hoops is a different matter entirely, but lack of a punishment doesn't mean that something is legally allowed or morally right.</p>
<p>The store could have a policy that says "Only people wearing a blue T-shirt can enter", and that would still be entirely legally enforceable. Just as you have the freedom to not enter a store like that, they have the freedom to require pretty much whatever they want. You might see a rule like that as stupid, illogical, unconstitutional, whatever, but your perspectives on the issue don't really matter in this circumstance. If you don't follow their rules, then you're trespassing on private property, provided that they ask you to leave and everything.</p>
<p>Doing what you've described in the post isn't "pushing back" or "giving them the red pill" or something, it's just being rude and inconsiderate.</p>
<p>I'm not saying all of this just to try and push some sort of pro-mask agenda, but posts like these are specifically what push people away from accepting any kind of reasonable thought from this kind of perspective.</p>

        <p>I believe that medical conditions are a protected class, I could be mistaken though. All the same, if i'm properly informed, all that would mean is that the store would have to make some sort of reasonable accommodation, not that they would just be forced to throw out all of their policies. That could mean that they make you wait outside and bring your groceries to you, it could mean that kick everybody else out of the store, it could mean a lot of things, but it doesn't <em>necessarily</em> mean that you just get a free pass to do what you want.</p>
<p>To relate back to the blue shirt analogy, somebody with psoriasis might not be able to wear cotton shirts, and maybe the only blue shirts in town are made of cotton. That wouldn't mean that the store is forced to let that person shop there, it means that they have to accommodate for that person's disability.</p>
<p>I haven't stated my opinion on masks one or the other, nor attempted to scrutinize or scorn anybody for not wearing one. Albeit self admittedly, i'm not a mask Nazi. I just dislike people being rude in social situations, then getting patted on the back for it. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance for hearing me out.</p>
