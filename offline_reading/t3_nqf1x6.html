        <p>So here's an interesting question for you.
Rockefeller Foundation was the size of Amazon in 1910 it completely controlled all the oil in the United States Standard Oil was broken up by friendly antitrust agreement arrangement negotiated and the Rockefeller Foundation ended up owning significant portions of the Seven sisters oil companies Exxon Mobil Chevron a bunch more. 
With wealth that size greater than Amazon with compounding interest it dwarfs anything else in the market it is obviously the largest trust because it's a private nonprofit Secret it's a private trust and so we don't know the size of the assets but we do know that in 1910 there were as big as Amazon so in this day and age how big would that be with compounding interest 50 times as big as Amazon?
Anyway they're the ones who actually run the United States they control the Federal Reserve and politics is really just a two sides of the fossil fuel party every legislator in the United States is very grateful for their recurring Pharma donations, oh by the way Rockefeller Foundation really helped create modern medicine and they own significant shares of all the Pharma companies.
So what does all this old history from 1910 have to do with today?
The Rockefeller Foundation funds pathogen research and conducted Event 201 with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
It is not in the least bit unreasonable to see that wrongdoing will be found and that they will need to pay some kind of retribution but with the scale of what they have done forfeiture of assets is a very reasonable proposition.</p>

        <p>Mate they researched it with influenza and it was deemed pointless, Covid is no different, with medicine, its usually 3 unexplained deaths and the medicine is cancelled, the mrna gen therapy has claimed a whopping 500, with 500,000 reported VAERS, yer 40 percent more likely to get a fatal side effect from the vaccine, than covid. So, good fucking luck with that.</p>

        <p>“3 unexplained deaths and the medicine is cancelled”. What?   Based on what?  Based on 3 deaths in how many people?</p>
<p>“They researched it with influenza and it was deemed pointless”. Who is they?  What is pointless?  Yet the CDC and your average family doctor will tell you to get vaccinated every year for the flu. </p>
<p>“500,000 reported VAERS?”  500,000 reported adverse effects in over 169,000,000 people with one dose and many of the 137,000,000 fully vaccinated people who have had 2 doses?</p>
<p>Yet no confirmed deaths linked to the vaccine at this point.  </p>
<p>Besides.  VAERS isn’t confirmed data, using it to claim the safety or lack thereof of a vaccine is misleading. </p>
<p>Just take the vaccine and stop LARPing as an epidemiologist/doctor on here.  The medical community has access to the same information you do and there’s a reason why they keep drawing the same conclusions they do.</p>
