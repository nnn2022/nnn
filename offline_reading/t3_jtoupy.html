    <strong>Why are so many people okay with this?</strong>
    <p><p>If I could ask the whole nation one question, it would be this. I’ve tried to have productive discussions with pro-lockdown people and it never ends well. At first I never wanted to belittle them or be rude, I just wanted to hear their reasoning. Over the past few weeks I’ve just gotten really frustrated. It seems as though some of their arguments are falling apart recently, too. I know it’s really not productive to try and reason with these people but I get bored at work.</p>
<p>In the US we’ve had some bad restrictions but not nearly as bad as some of the rest of the world. I see people here asking for heavier restrictions. Most people calling for lockdowns are leftists. Those same people call our president a fascist, but want more control. I don’t understand. Why do so many people want to give up their freedom? At this rate I’m more concerned with our freedom than this virus.</p></p>

        <p>Wannabe commies are ok with it because it’s advancing their agenda.</p>
<p>Climate crisis people are ok with it because it’s advancing their agenda.</p>
<p>Miserable people are ok with it because it forces everyone else to be a miserable hermit just like them.</p>
<p>Easily impressionable people are brainwashed into a state of fear and will do anything they’re told.</p>

        <p>Also unhealthy people in general are ok with it. Unhealthy people would rather make everyone stay home and wear masks so they can continue to drink and get fast food from Uber eats in their air conditioned homes than do things proven to strengthen your immune system like working out, vitamin d from the sun, eating healthy whole foods, etc.</p>

        <p>You do know that the stuff made in restaurants and delivered are made with the EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS as the stuff you make at home, <strong>RIGHT?</strong></p>

        <p>I said “fast food”. Are you trying to argue that having Uber eats deliver your Big Mac and fries is as healthy and and is the “EXACT SAME INGREDIENTS as the stuff you make at home”?</p>

        <p>Most people are not above average smart  and they have never used much critical thinking skills especially when reading the news. They just assume because it’s the news it’s true. Even though media has always been lying to the public for the corporate or political interest. (Weapons of mass destruction,anyone?)That’s how they got “we are the 99%” to vote the corporate democrats like Obama, Clinton and Biden BACK in the office by telling them 4 years “orange man bad”.</p>
<p>Also I think modern people living in western countries are mostly soft humans with little knowledge about history and they never had to struggle for anything. Perfect sheeples</p>

        <p>I’m going to make an educated guess and assume it’s because it doesn’t affect them. </p>
<p>I believe that if the internet didn’t exist, the entirety of society would’ve been completely against lockdowns since day one. </p>
<p>Most of the people that support this hysteria are; antisocial teenagers, privileged manchildren, basement-dwelling incel misanthropes, narcissistic scientists, nurses and “experts” that no one cared about, and rich people with WFH jobs.</p>
<p>They’re getting paid for 1/4 of their usual effort and getting treated like war veterans for posting about their quirky ‘QuArAnTiNe’ on TikTok while essential workers continue to slave away for minimum wage to deliver them all of their food and groceries. </p>
<p>I have yet to hear any of my teenage friends say they’re enjoying their 10-month isolation in solitary confinement. There’s a lot more people on our side than you’d believe.</p>

        <p>Without the internet our only source of information would have been the MSM that turned full propaganda mode during this year. I think that only because of the internet the anti-lockdown minority exists, without it most of us would have been isolated and brainwashed by the media and society to conform to the "new normal". This is similar to other minority groups shunned by the MSM like vaccine and climate change skeptics.</p>

        <p>Nah. Before social media this literally wouldn't have happened. Every other virus proves that. MERS, SARS COV1, H1N1 Swine Flu, Ebola, Zika, and that's just all the 21st century. No lockdown, no hysteria. All because social media hadn't fully developed yet. You started to see it with Ebola but since Trump wasn't the president the media didn't make it a big deal and just reported it like normal.</p>

        <p>Every religion will get some followers. The trick is to concoct a religion that fools MOST of the people. They did a good job with this scamdemic! You are arguing with "religiously converted" people. Rationality won't work. You need to research the psychology methods they use to get people out of cults. Maybe then you'd have better tools to deal with religious fanatics. The BIG trick they did was to clothe this new religion in pseudo science, so the "converted" sheep *think* they are being all scientific.</p>

        <p>A lot of the most outspoken people aren’t suffering. They just can’t relate. As always, there are outliers, but I think the majority of pro-lockdowners fit these few categories:</p>
<p>*Work from home techies who are saving money with the lack of commute.</p>
<p>*Upper middle class families or partners with comfortable homes who don’t have to worry about isolation or their childrens’ educational neglect.</p>
<p>*Young adults still supported by parents, who can rely on their families as a safety net if they find themselves unemployed.</p>
<p>*Antisocial shut-ins (different from introverts) who don’t care about the state of the world as long as their video games are working.</p>

        <p>Cause they’re fucking brainwashed and can’t think for themselves. “Don’t you care about people? We need to lockdown so we can save lives. If you care more about your freedom than saving lives then you’re selfish.”</p>
<p>All the mainstream media is doing is fear mongering and pushing this narrative. And most people can’t use logic to see how deaths are inflated, “cases” are inflated, masks don’t work, and that these restrictions are destroying society, the economy, and yes, lives too.</p>
<p>You don’t know what you got till it’s gone, and in this case, it’s freedom.</p>

        <p>We have to try to find common ground, or just say fuck it and fight it out. Their argument is that our fear of losing freedom is exaggerated and irrational. So we think the exact same thing about one another in complete opposite directions. I don’t think we’re going to be able to reason our way out of this</p>

        <p>You bring up a great point about being more afraid for our freedom than the virus. When we first lockdown I stated the same position. This power grab still scares me to today. I don't understand this fear that people have. There is so much evidence that's its not deadly.  We built make shift hospitals that never got used, we converted an arena to a makeshift hospital, we brought in naval ships for hospitals over flow, we made a huge deal about ventilators that were not needed. We've been wrong the whole time,  but I still feel like the general public is terrified. I don't understand this.  The experts been wrong at everything and the sheep keep buying their b@llshit</p>

        <p>This has been in the making of quite some time. The world is becoming more collectivist and globalist, even in the US we see this trend, like the movement toward nationalization of healthcare and earlier ths initiation of Social Security.  </p>
<p>Liberty is an abstract concept, unlike the material gaing the socialist populists promise to the masses. There is no simple solution.</p>
