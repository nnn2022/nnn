    <strong>People without kids during all this</strong>
    <p><p>Does anybody else have childless people in your lives that are even more unbearable nowadays? It was one thing to talk about your dogs or cats but now, if we want to get our kids back to some normalcy, these childless people scold you like they have any fucking clue what it’s like to parent during all of this. The added stress of the uncertainty of school is enough to drive a man suicidal. Then these childless fucks spend all day indulging in whatever selfish activities they have while talking down to everyone else. “Just binge Netflix for a few weeks and we’ll get through this.” “Keep your kids at home and keep the schools closed bro, it’s the only way to get through this. School isn’t a daycare.”</p>
<p>Edit: apologies for coming across so negative toward people without kids. I know they’re not all the same and that WE are all similar with NoNewNormal.</p></p>

        <p>I've not got kids but I was completely against schools closing. I know some people with kids and they have to juggle work and schooling, childcare on a daily basis and some are not so lucky to have an understanding boss that knows they can only realistically do half or less of the work in a day, some work for strict companies and they lose their minds trying to work full time and take care of the kid or kids. It's ridiculous to expect people who work from home to take on being teachers etc. Even if people are on furlough, having the kid around 100% must be tiring. 
It's hard on all of us but clearly it is so much harder on people with small school age kids.</p>

        <p>After the debacle of online schooling that rolled out in our District. I pulled my kids from public school.</p>
<p>The curriculum that was provided required constant supervision to keep them on task. I figured if I'm going to be schooling my children I was going to do it my way.</p>
<p>It's been better since we started homeschooling. The kids are happy. We've meet new people, made new friends, and the kids are happier. There's local groups for socializing and field trips with group rates.</p>
<p>Fuck our broken school system.</p>

        <p>Ugh.</p>
<p>Can you not generalize people? I'm childless, and no, I oppose the restrictions. Many people in this sub are similarly childless as well, I'm sure. People against the new normal need to stop painting certain groups with the same brush, and placing blame and frustrations on them too.</p>

        <p>Am also childless, and hate the restrictions.  All my friends who are childless hate them as well.  We miss socializing in public spaces.  And I really do feel for parents who are stuck working <em>and</em> making sure their kids are doing their remote schooling at the same time.  It's not fair any of us have to pay taxes for schooling and daycare the kids aren't currently getting.</p>

        <p>We can't keep pointing fingers at each other if we want to get things done. Because, yes, there are people on our side (obese, elderly, gay, minorities, childless, wfh, introverts, gamers, liberals, and so on) who tick those boxes. Rants like this just further the divide amongst us, and also turn off people who fit those boxes who are willing to come over to join us as well.</p>

<p>This is...one of the most condescending things I've ever seen on Reddit. Wow.</p>
<p>&rt; Children change you and your priorities.</p>
<p>No, not for everyone. There's tons of children of bad parents who would disagree with this. </p>
<p>Furthermore, many of us, who don't or won't have children aren't inherently less responsible or serious than people who do have them.</p>

<p>3 day old account. All posts are skewed towards blaming the obese and those with co-morbidities. Most comments are inflammatory, and meant to insult people. "Rule by division". Interesting username, too. Food for thought.</p>

        <p>So you're telling me at 37 I'm not an adult even though I manage my finances, do my taxes, pay my mortgage and manage a house but apparently I'm a child just because I didn't go along with some absurd societal norm? But a 20 year old child who doesn't do any of the above can pop out a kid and be an adult even though they can be living with their parents or on welfare or whatever...just for example.</p>

        <p>Well I also didn't ask to be ripped from the void so I'd prefer to let my lineage end with me. I'm not gonna thrust disease aging cancer and death on an innocent. Not to mention living in an uncertain time where who knows if people will find work or pay bills again. I'd say it was being selfless rather than selfish.</p>

        <p>“I was ripped  involuntarily from the void” - nothing stopping you jumping back into it if you don’t like what you were given. That is one of the most feeble arguments I have ever heard. Common with angsty teenagers.</p>
<p>You just proved my first statement in the first line.  I have heard this line before and always from the same type of person.</p>

        <p>Great and that's your opinion there are many of us who choose not to impose this on another person. I'm here so I'm just making the most of it. Doesn't mean all of us are suicidal. I hate when people are like great kill yourself just because I don't want to have someone be burdened by this all. How about if I have a kid and it has a disability sorry but ill be honest I'm not trying to devote my life to that. So I'm trying to make the most of it while I'm here and seeing as how you probably have the means to care for children you do you boo. I'm not a teenager either I'm 37 almost 38 years old.</p>

        <p>In a weird way tho you have condemned another potential person to non life because of your beliefs, damned if you do and damned if don’t?</p>
<p>I didn’t tell you to commit suicide, just pointing out that you didn’t put your money where your mouth was with - “ripped from the void”.</p>
<p>The chances of your kid being disabled and carried to full term are similar to your chances of death from covid. Your reasons are fairly selfish and “childish”. My point still stands.</p>
<p>So you expect my children to pay your way when you can’t work anymore, this  is impoverishing them for your needs, or are you just going to cash out then?</p>
<p>The duality of people. 
I am sure you will remember this conversation in 30 years when you are pissing yourself in an old persons home.</p>

        <p>Actually by not having kids I've saved enough money to look after myself in any means I'd like. So you assume that every person who has kids the kids will look after them when they're old? Is that why nursing homes are filled with people whose kids just threw them there and never visit. So you just have kids as an insurance policy like they won't be living their own lives when you're old and moldy? Maybe take care of yourself and get out of the mindset that people owe you their life just because you birthed them. Its disturbing really.</p>

        <p>No, it’s about economics... so you may have money but who is making the food, and putting the work in to make sure you can spend your money.  Your cash savings are likely to be worthless soon.  You also previously stated you couldn’t afford children? So which is it you have loads of capital or you have none?</p>
<p>No I have kids because they added another dimension to life and a deeper meaning to an otherwise pointless existence. I’m not expecting them to look after me, I’m expecting them to keep the biological cogs turning for many more millennia.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about an octopus? One of the other most intelligent life forms on this planet, fucking interesting animals, all their intelligence is geared towards attracting a mate and reproducing, after which they kinda give up and die. </p>
<p>You are just a product of a similar lineage, except society has convinced our generation to not have babies. It’s much the same across the board for people born in the 80s and up. You are living in an exponentially aging population, who is going to keep the farms and supply lines running? You aren’t going to be able to work or grow your own until you drop dead.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled population growth is a debunked myth, and was perpetrated by the same people you disagree with in terms of lockdowns and new normal.</p>

        <p>So you're saying just have kids to make them wage slaves to keep the world running? Because that's basically what they'll be doing. Slaving away like we do. Actually my husband and I do well so we save that money but also use some to live in a nice house drive nice cars and take vacations whenever and however we want. We save a lot by not spending money on rearing children. We have nieces and nephews so we're good. I can't afford them in the sense I don't want that money going towards them. There's no guarantee they won't be stuck living with me til they're 40 years old and there goes my retirement. Its an example but it happens especially nowadays. Anywho like I said I'm old already I'm good with life. You do you and be happy. You can't convince me to reproduce in this late stage if I haven't already. Also my husband is fixed. 🙂</p>

        <p>This wasn’t about convincing  you to have kids; it was pointing out that on the whole people who choose not to, tend to have a self centred childish outlook on life- gimme toys and entertainment and money over genuine wealth which is different from money ;), all which you have alluded to, (nice cars,money,house,holidays, ripped from the void). I’ve pulled all of those answers out of your responses. </p>

        <p>Yes...and especially the “just watch Netflix!” “Enjoy sleeping in, and working on your hobby” I mean...are they freaking kidding me???? Most parents are busier than ever, and near their breaking point- many are working full time from home while trying to supervise distance learning at the same time. Many parents end up being up late at night to finish work that didn’t get done during the day- and are getting little sleep, and have bad no free time for nearly a year. And these are the “lucky” ones who haven’t been laid off or lost their jobs. Many are going through terrible financial hardships due to lockdowns. “Just binge Netflix”??? what a joke. For parents, we are not getting an extended vacation...far from.</p>

        <p>I don't have kids, and used to subscribe to childfree subreddit, but unsubscribed because of their ruthless hatred of parents throughout all of this. I can't imagine what it would be like having to work from home while having multiple children doing online "school" with no outlets and nowhere to go. I'm not even a huge kid person but even I can see how that would bring about extreme stress. I want children to be able to freely play, attend school, and have fun. The childfree folks were all "Why did you have kids if you don't wanna spend time with them?!!!?1" Like, that's not the issue? The issue is that every pillar of society has come crashing down overnight and most people didn't have children with the expectation they'd essentially be homeschooling them all of a sudden while also trying to balance their own careers, unless they purposefully chose to homeschool?</p>

        <p>I’m childless and against shutdowns. I’ve said the entire time how lucky I am that I don’t have to deal with any of this. (I’m also essential and haven’t once worked from home.) I have some friends that are essential, instead of being able to send their kids to school-they had to pay a daycare to have a daycare worker supervise their kids doing online school. Thankfully that only lasted about 2 weeks and schools opened back up.</p>

        <p>Oh, mombie mad because she has to live with her own choices? I am childfree and thanking God I choose to because even during hard times I get to spend time and money on me and my husband. I do feel sorry for you though, it must be sad to be locked up with your bundles of joy that are the best thing that happened to you ;)</p>

        <p>It's what the left has been preaching for years: "You don't know the trials of X group so you're unfit to judge, assess, or relate to them."  But since they threw their book out the window in 2020, it's exposed as pure selfishness.  They will ask anyone to do anything or put up with anything, from childcare and schooling issues to spousal/child abuse and poverty/starvation so they can stay afraid in their homes and preach on this new cause-to-end-all-causes.</p>
<p>My kids are young still, but the fear that i'll soon have to figure out how to afford private school, or home school, or move to south dakota, or something else to make sure my kids have a quality education (like the one with which I was blessed in the glory days of the virginia G&amp;T program of the 80s) is, as you say, stressful beyond belief.</p>
<p>For now, my goal is simply to make sure these kids are outdoors, social, and exposed to everything I can to continue the development of their brains during these crucial years.  They can't get to museums, don't spend much time outside the few houses and daycares to which they currently have access, don't travel, and can't even get a diverse exposure to faces and expressions.  I'm grateful our daycares are willing to ignore the rules that say they too should be masked, or we'd have to pull them out of those.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's stressful, and if you don't have kids, you don't have any idea.</p>

        <p>But if we don't have kids we also made a choice not to have them and not to be Uber stressed out. Just as you made a choice to have them. Even us childfree people are reaching a breaking point because we have other stresses in life doesn't have to be children.</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to diminish the trials others face, nor suggest I didn't bring this on myself :)</p>
<p>The sentiment is just that if they're not subject to this, but claiming its not a big deal and just stay inside and we'll get through it, they're speaking from the same ignorance and insensitivitytthey used to claim was a big deal.</p>
