        <p>I bet they called anyone who suggested that vaccine passports were going to be a thing a “conspiracy theorist”. Now it’s a reality and they’re actually advocating it. And no, you don’t have the right to know whether I’ve been vaccinated or not. That’s private medical information. Dipshit.</p>

        <p>Did you ever ask about other vaccinations before? Do you realize how much lower the risk from covid is compared to most other infections that we vaccinate against?</p>
<p>If you want to be protected get the shot yourself. If you can't, you have much more serious issues to worry about than covid.</p>

<p>No we don't. It's a fucking flu. Why would anyone do that? We've all got the flu before, it sucks, you take it easy for a couple days and try to get some sleep and then you move on with your life.</p>
<p>How fucking sloppy are these doughy fuckers they get sick on such a regular basis they think to take drugs for it? Take care of your body, holy shit.</p>

        <p>Kek. You do know what a vaccine is right? If you take one that works you're immune from infection because you've artificially induced the production of the antibodies.</p>
<p>If it doesn't work, then why take it?</p>
<p>This idea that EVERYONE must take these drugs (they don't even let you pick which one lmao) is nothing more than naked totalitarian horseshit. How about you do or do not get one if you so choose and I will respect that decision and I will make my own decision on it as well and you respect that.</p>
<p>Even the people here who don't subscribe to pessimistic scenarios on the side effects of the purported vaccines would rather take the known risk of COVID-19 infection than the unknown risk of these new and hastily developed drugs. Who the fuck knows what will pop up in 20 or 30 years? You ever hear of thalodomide? We don't know and we can't know, because these drugs have only been around for a few months. Enough people I know personally have had a few solid days of covid symptoms afterward (lol!) that I'm scratching my head wondering what the fuck is the appeal of this thing. And they still gotta wear the muzzle and stand on the stickers at the grocery store!</p>

        <p>I dunno, a few days of covid symptoms sounds better than the solid month of being bed ridden that I experienced. I agree it needs to be more vigorously tested, but just as everyone once got the polio vaccine to eradicate the virus, we should be doing the same with a covid vaccine, so that once we reach critical immunity in the population, we will be able to go back to “normal”. Honestly, I thought that was the point of this sub.</p>

        <p>If you don't mind me asking bro what are your stats? Bench, deadlift, squat, 5k? What's your diet like? Do you sleep regular hours? Do you smoke? Do you get enough Vitamin D? Do you masturbate? Are you in a healthy monogamous relationship? Do you have an active social life?</p>
<p>A month of being bedridden I've only ever heard of happening to fat people and AverageRedditors and the very old.</p>
<p>Not that it's relevant anyway. Your health is your responsibility. You're free to nurture it or neglect it as you please, you're a grown man and can make your own decisions. "Normal" is not some bargaining chip the authorities have any right to hold over us, freedom is not conditional. We're not going to ask nicely for the permission to live our lives. What went wrong in your childhood that you think this way? Was there some traumatic event that ingrained in your head the idea that it's safer to be passive and let someone else guide the parameters of your day to day experience?</p>
<p>Furthermore, what's it going to take for you to stop doing that? What line will they need to cross, what new misery and humiliation would they have to inflict on you to induce your nuts to drop and for you to say No?</p>

        <p>I just have a strong sense of community and responsibility. I don’t really give a fuck about what the government says, I just want people I love to not get sick. I don’t smoke or drink, I’m asthmatic, and haven’t been to the gym in over a year for obvious reasons, and have predisposition for diabetes and cancer, so yeah, I’m a high risk person for sure. I’m bipolar, have ADHD, and have general depression. And many of the people I love are also high risk. They’re pretty much the only people I give a fuck for. I already saw covid sweep through my friend group, and of the four of us that got it, I had the worst symptoms, my 2 partners after that, and the last one was asymptomatic.</p>

        <p>There’s no way to know for sure at all times that you don’t have something transmissible. If you think that others health is in your hands then you shouldn’t be going out even after the covid vaccine, or natural infection. I hope you’re doing your part in shaming fat people since their health is in your hands.</p>

        <p>If you want to go down this road OK. I want signs on anyone I think could be a threat at all time. Past prisoner I need to know. History of mental Illness you sought treatment for I need to know since I don't know if you'll go off again and hurt me and my loved ones. Or better yet barcodes so I can look up their entire history!</p>
<p>You know, since you don't have the right to withhold personal information from me since I need it to correctly evaluate your threat level. To keep me and mine safe!</p>

        <p>Ill give you the same example, but overexaggerated. They have no right to put metal detectors on airports, because I do not consent to others knowing wether I am with a bomb or weapon or not. How does this compare to the immunisation passports? Well, they do the same thing  - ensure other people's safety. If you do not want to tell other people that it is safe around you - do not go to the airport and thats it. Easy.</p>

        <p>I’m glad you acknowledged this is over exaggerated because wow is this bad. To make this analogy work you need to acknowledge that nobody knows they have a bomb on them, other passengers are easily able to wear a bomb proof vest, and the bomb is actually a small firework.</p>

        <p>Yes, the point is that its way overexaggerated. Making an analogy here will be very hard and it wont be balanced at all. That why I prefaced this by saying its overexxagerated.</p>

        <p>I can get blown up while waiting for the train, running a marathon, praying in a church or attending an Ariana Grande concert but at least I know that I'm protected from pesky water bottles while on a plane. Thank you daddy Government. I wonder why we aren't implementing that type of security at the entrances of supermarkets and all other establishments. Can't risk dying, ever. We should just monitor people 24/7, ankle bracelets and all.</p>

        <p>Lol like metal detectors are causing infertility, auto immune disease, and who knows what else. 
This “vaccine” isn’t even a vaccine. Metaphorically, It’s not a metal detector but a cardboard box-that is being shoved down your throat and altering your RNA, thus changing the function of your DNA.</p>

        <p>"Direct evidence of the impact of vaccination on the risk of transmission is only available from one study, a large register-based household transmission study from Scotland. This study suggests that vaccination of a household member reduces the risk of infection in susceptible household members by at least 30%."</p>
<p>so it references this study but theres no link to it or citation. Also, doesn't "register-based" mean self-reported? How do we know people in these households just didn't know they had covid? Most cases are asymptomatic and its possible that they got sick and just assumed it wasn't covid because of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic infection already reduces greatly the risk of transmission even in the absence of vaccination.</p>
<p>There is more evidence that immunity makes transmission negligible. It is common sense, the duration of potential infection will be significantly shortened, and the lack of symptoms will reduce the risk of spreading virus particles. Additionally, those may be weakened due to the rapid immune response.</p>
<p>Below is one more link to add to the pile, but I don't really think we need any evidence that vaccination reduces transmission, the burden of evidence should be on the other side, because it is completely devoid of any logic.</p>

        <p>sorry, the burden of evidence is on the side of the pharmaceutical companies and regulators. You cant just inject people with something, call it "vaccination" and then say the burden of evidence is on everyone else to prove it doesn't work. That's retarded, Sasha</p>

        <p>The cited article clearly draws a distinction between the US, where “the stringent gene-therapy regulations are bypassed because mRNA does not integrate into the host genome,” and Europe, where it “falls under the scope of the regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products” and is therefore categorized as gene therapy. I will grant you that there is some debate about the semantics of the term “gene therapy.”</p>
<p>What is <em>not</em> up for debate is the fact that people such as yourself use the term “gene therapy” in a pejorative sense intended to cause distrust in the safety and/or efficacy of the vaccine. I, therefore, find it <em>interesting</em> that the article <em>you rely on</em> makes it clear that it doesn’t agree with you on this point. From the article: “With the dozens of mRNA-based vaccine candidates currently in pre-clinical and clinical phases of development, it is evident that the mRNA-based vaccine technology is a promising tool for the development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.”</p>

        <p>The article doesn’t prove me wrong, it specifically highlights that there is a difference of opinion about what constitutes “gene therapy,” a point I concede. </p>
<p>You’re being disingenuous when you say, “I actually wasn’t making any argument or point about the efficacy of the vaccine whatsoever.” What other possible reason could there be for you to be arguing the esoteric point about whether or not the vaccine qualifies as gene therapy except to denigrate it? </p>

        <p>They do not change your rna. Rna is a temporary product of the cells, like a blueprint to build proteins. The vaccins contains rna that your cells process until they consume it all, in order to build covid-like parts that your immune system can study and fight. When it is all consumed, your cells go back to their usual routine. The most important is your dna, contained in the core of your cells. It cannot be altered. Your celles use it to produce specific rna for specific tasks, which is then consumed.</p>

        <p>Can you read mate? I said DNA could be changed/altered, so we agree on that. 
I disagree with the wording 'consumed' because it implies a subject that is eating. Rna or other genetic material (and yes genetic code is a fairly biological phrase) is disassambled when no longer needed.</p>

        <p>If you are downvoting this response or upvoting the comment to which it is responding then you do not understand molecular biology in the slightest. Also, I'm not sure why the person who originally said that "You are much less likely to transmit it after a vaccine" is getting downvoted. That too has been the finding of a vast body of the research done on the topic.</p>

        <p>Research doesn't count if it doesn't agree with their narrative. Same with statistics: they mock people for being afraid of a "99.9%" <em>survival</em> rate virus, but they are terrified of a 99.999999% safe vaccine.</p>

        <p>H3H3 stopped being cool years ago. Ever since Ethan started the podcast, he got this weird ego, like he thought he was an actual celebrity or something rather than just some random dipshit making funny youtube videos, and this also inflated his sense of worth in terms of how he viewed his own opinions. I had to stop watching altogether because it was pretty nuts watching him transform from a "fairly funny guy who just comments on stupid shit" to "self-righteous know-it-all who considers himself super wise and sage like, and thinks he is the most important person in any room"</p>

        <p>The argument is because vaccines are only about 50% effective so having EVERYONE vaccinated (with true vaccines, not these gene therapies posing as vaccines) much lessens the chance of people who are not vaccinated spreading to those who got the vaccine and were the unlucky 50%.</p>

        <p>ya i do, look it up, 11 out of the last 13 outbreaks of measles, wooping cough, and other diseases STARTED from people who GOT THE VACCINES and spread largely among people who HAD the vaccines (95%+ vaccination rates)</p>
<p>so not only did the vaccines not protect them, the vaccines SPREAD THE VIRUS</p>

        <p>Because 95% effective does not actually equal 100% effective.  No vaccine is 100% effective (and because there are people who can't get vaccinated including, right now, everyone under age 16).  Herd immunity in a community makes it much more unlikely a person will be exposed.  This has worked for everything that we routinely vaccinate children for, like measles (two doses of that vaccine is 97% effective).   This vaccine does reduce transmission rates, obviously.</p>

        <p>It is not “transmitted from one generation to the next” because its synthetic mRNA. Where do you think scientists found the material needed to produce the synthetic mRNA? The answer is in its natural environment where the RNA was transmitted from one generation to the next millions of times over millions of years. Forgive the author of the definition for forgetting to include the possibility of Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA when he wrote it.</p>
<p>If a synthetic heart is grown artificially and transplanted into a patient does that negate the definition of a heart? </p>

        <p>If you “knew I would say that” then why did you use a definition that <em>directly undermines your position</em>? I have nothing to forgive the author of the definition <em>for</em>, since he didn’t “forget to include the possibility of Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA.” It simply has no bearing on the definition of the term “gene.”</p>

        <p>Because it's the very first definition I found and my assumption that you would scrutinise over a nonessential portion of the definition was an after thought. I agree, it wasn't the optimal choice.</p>
<p>That being said, the definition is not incorrect nor is it absolute. And the nonessential portion of the definition does not invalidate the other 75% of the definition that does describe mRNA perfectly.</p>
<p>Just look up any other definition of gene on Google and see if it relies on genetics being transmitted from one generation to the next for it to be considered accurate. I can't. And the fact that you have reduced to splitting hairs is testament to the fact you don't really have an argument to make.</p>

        <p>Of course they didn't want us to reach herd immunity by just letting everyone get the virus.  That would have caused hundreds of thousands of additional deaths in the U.S. alone.  It may happen in Brazil if there isn't more intervention to get enough vaccines distributed, but it's a horrible tragedy.  Natural herd immunity is what used to happen after a contagious illness ran through most of a population.  It was never a goal.  Now we have vaccines, which mean we can reach herd immunity without all of the sickness and dying.  </p>
<p>Please explain how it is "gene therapy".   Do you understand how these vaccines work?</p>

https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(16)30267-2</p>
<p>Moderna's chief medical officer describes their mRNA approach as gene therapy (information therapy) before COVID:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU-cqTNQhMM</p>
<p>SEC filing by Moderna for their mRNA therapy:
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000168285220000017/mrna-20200630.htm
“Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism.”</p>

        <p>Do you understand that it is not like other vaccines that inject an inactive virus that your body then develops an immunity to, instead they inject some mRNA that forces your body to create a protein which your immune system then develops an immunity to. That protein being part of the COVID virus, among other things.<br>

        <p>I do understand that.  It's not what is typically defined as gene therapy.   Most definitions of gene therapy involve altering a patient's genes.  Some people read "gene therapy" and think that it meets that definition, when it does not.</p>

        <p>I saw Godzilla V Kong in theaters, went bowling and played pool Friday. I'm going to a Phillies game this month. I told my neighbor this and they went "better get tested... I hope you have the vaccine at least... I won't be going out for at least another few months". She essentially treated me like I'm insane when she wears a mask to check her mail(not a joke). </p>
<p>On a sidenote, living in Philly during covid is wierd cause while it's a vote blue city the people are a lot more libertarian, so basically no one has followed covid guidelines(multiple bbqs, pickup basketball, full movie theaters, crowds of over 100) and we've had a pretty low case rate.</p>

        <p>The thing is that the way he says it sounds logical, because it is, actions have consequences and yea yea yea I get it. What he(and many others) are forgetting is the consequences of complying with a vaccine passport, and how you're essentially giving these corporations and world governments access to your sealed, legally private medical records with the scan of a QR code. </p>
<p>I also find it funny that the same people who never shut up about corporatism, governments overstepping their power etcetera will bend over backwards to defend them so they can get internet points.</p>

        <p>All of this presumes that asymptomatic spread is real. It's not. It never has been for any previous pandemic, and Fauci said it himself just a year ago. Ethan is not a very intelligent person. If a person is not coughing, sneezing, or nursing a fever, they're not putting your family at risk. And if you think they are, maybe keep your family home.</p>

        <p>So I just got over Covid. I had a day of a stuffy nose and 2 days of a tickle on my throat and all I can keep thinking about is how glad I am I didn’t opt for the vaccine to avoid a cold basically. But I live in CA where our dumb ass governor is saying you need a vaccine passport to attend concerts.</p>
<p>Um, 1, I’ve already had Covid so why do I need a vaccine? To give me the same antibodies I already have?</p>
<p>2, a vaccine doesn’t prevent transmission. If you are worried about Covid, YOU get a vaccine.</p>
<p>3, even if you get a vaccine once, that doesn’t mean you never have to get it again, just like you need to get a flu vaccine every season so are they going to have staff at concerts making sure your vaccine is up to date?</p>
<p>In short, this is idiotic and none of it makes sense. Just more virtual signaling from our governor</p>

        <p>Do these idiots genuinely not understand what coercion and are so used to not exercising free will they don't stop and think about it? Or is this some kind of gaslighting attempt? I had this asshole on Facebook tell me after I said prisoners are still human beings and they should not be forced to take the purported vaccine "they can be in solitary confinement if they don't want to take it, no one is forcing them".</p>

        <p>I don't understand. How does someone else getting vaccinated protect others? Wearing a mask may or may not prevent the spread to others, but a vaccine only protects the person who took it... that's literally the only purpose</p>

        <p>That guy is so grossly obese (medical terms) he had to crop his photo that close to look human... If he truly has a family like he claims, they are statistically likely to be in a similar BMI range. His poor example is a bigger threat to their health than the vaccine status of any other human being ever could.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: it's not anti-semitism. I don't dislike him because his of jewish heritage nor I think it makes him less worthy,  I dislike him 'cause his (half) nationality loves, in the most unexpected turn of events, nazi politics! If anything, I'm xenophobic. But we call Canadians commies around here, so keep it 100.</p>
