        <p>The only person I know had severe depression and was elder. She got covid and survived it fine, but died a few months later just because she already had nothing left to give between her mental illness and aging body. Her depression made her stop eating, making things much worse. I hope she’s in peace now.</p>

        <p>I am sorry to hear hat. Please feel hugged. This should not have happened. She didn't had the plague or something, and the government never gets tired of telling us how we need masks to be safe. So why would they be afraid? I don't get it.</p>
<p>My sister returned from maternity leave to get back into her job at a nursing home. I find it horrible to think of the baby now being in kindergarden, being only a year old, but I am also proud that she joined the brave germans in my country who care for the elderly people despite covid.</p>

        <p>At one of the first anti-corona demos I went to, a guy was wearing a placard/sign that said simply "My father died from loneliness"</p>
<p>It's clear that this is what these policies do, and to me it's clear that dying of loneliness is worse than dying of covid induced inability to breathe or drowning of the lungs (I forget what the medical term is).</p>
<p>If there is going to be justice, what's been done to children and the elderly and everyone should be considered war crimes. They are an assault on human dignity.</p>
<p>Further there are also those in the developing world pushed into starvation level hunger by the policies. Hunger like this is considered to be torture, in international human rights law.</p>
<p>International human rights law takes precedence over emergency law. It's designed such that even in wartime, there is no excuse.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those who are "just following orders" cannot use this as a defense; they are personally liable for their actions.</p>
<p>In some cases (when the crime results in the death of victim(s)), the penalty for the perpetrator is death.</p>
<p>It's actually quite remarkable that we have crossed many of these lines. When I saw that guy's sign at that demo, I was very upset, because I had mostly been worrying over my own circumstances, and not imagined what it would be like to die in forced medical isolation as an elderly person.</p>
<p>Again, when one words it that way, one thinks of "torture" and "war crimes".</p>

<p>Same here, but we have the advantage of internet and phones to help us connect. I imagine that a lot of elderly people like the one above don't have the ability to use modern tech, so it's impossible for them to have their social needs met this way.</p>

        <p>As you get older, I think the digital fails to be a substitute. There's a reason old people go bird-watching, for example. And they sing in church choirs even when they have practically lost their voices. Once you're that old, if you're not engaging the body in every way you can (albeit gently), the body will just give up due to lack of input. When younger it's the sex hormones that keep the body going even when it is neglected, I would say.</p>

<p>Your brain does that too. The brain is an enormously expensive machine to operate, and neurons consume something crazy like 20x as much energy as muscle. It's an evolutionary advantage to trim it as much as possible, so keeping busy and doing things is important if you don't want to become a mental vegetable.</p>

        <p>The only word I would agree with in your sentence is “victim.” Because I think it’s fair to say pretty much everyone over the past year (whether they had Covid or not) has been the victim of some aspect of what’s been done on a worldwide stage, in varying degrees, by essentially every government on the planet. There are also many people who have been victims of the hysterical “Covid is black death” mob who has attacked and come after a lot of private citizens (both on social media and in real life). </p>
<p>But not very many people have been victims of straight up Covid and nothing else. And absolutely nobody has been a victim of the actual plague (please check yourself and take a moment to read up on what the plague truly is — both THE actual plague and AN actual plague). Because this doesn’t even begin to qualify as one. No one, in our society or anywhere else else in the known universe, has been sufferer of the plague — nor has anyone been a carrier or spreader of a plague or THE plague (it is an actual, identifiable disease; they have samples of it in the freezers at many laboratories around the world, including the infamous one in Wuhan we’ve all heard so much about).</p>

        <p>I am in the same exact boat as you. I know 2 people who died by suicide, 0 who died of Covid. </p>
<p>I barely even know anybody who had a confirmed case of Covid, and absolutely no one in my orbit who had a serious case of Covid (though I have heard of people who did — friend of a friend situations and I’ve run across a few people who I don’t actually know, but for some reason wound up in a conversation with, who have said they had Covid, some of whom were hospitalized). </p>
<p>And to touch back on the original point, I know 2 people who died of suicide over the past year and 4 who wound up in the hospital due to suicide attempts. All 4 wound up spending time at in-patient psychiatric facilities after their agents and all 4 lived. But 1 of those who lived was the college-aged son of a close friend. His is perhaps the most tragic out of those 4 because he attempted suicide in such a manner that he did permanent, life-long damage to his body. He’ll be living with the consequences of that failed attempt forever and they were pretty significant.</p>

        <p>My 93 yo mom (ok. I'm old) didn't leave her house for a year and a half. My siblings who live nearby her city discouraged her from leaving the house this entire time. Before the Plandemic, she was taking public transportation almost daily, attending a local church twice a week, visited the YMCA for her weekly exercise in the swimming pool and attended a weekly seniors meeting. I live several states away from her, so in March, I flew over and, broke her out of the house and spent a day with her, took her out for lunch, took her to visit my dad's grave site upon her request, and took her grocery shopping. During my visit, I encouraged her to take walks around the block for some sun and fresh air. Since my visit, she's ventured out and takes daily walks around her neighborhood. I hate the fact that a 93 yo healthy woman lost a year and a half of her life. You could argue that being house bound kept her safe, but she will tell you that she'd rather be free to live out her old age than live in fear.</p>

        <p>This is the view of so many elderly people I know, they haven't got much left anyway so they want to spend time with their grandchildren instead of isolating in their houses. My mother in law spent a good few months at home shielding and had all these plans what she'll do with the grandchildren and where she'll take them once Covid is over, only to suddenly die from cancer a couple months ago. She would have gotten cancer either way but she could have spent her last year a lot better than sitting at home.</p>

        <p>My grandmother isn't that old, had kids one after another at 14 and grew up poor, like had a dirt floor poor. She married a really good  rich guy late in life, who ended up dying 5 yrs ago. Now instead of enjoying her life without any financial worry, she sits at home with the tv convincing her she will die if she leaves the house. I hate the media so much.</p>

        <p>Yeah, my mom now passes her time watching youtube videos instead of visiting other seniors. Sad.
Interesting point about the media. If there's no social media, then the gov could more easily control the narrative theough network tv, which is why twitter and fb are working so hard to censor alternative voices.</p>

        <p>I know of a few. Of course I was the asshole to ask if they'd had any health concerns or ailments.</p>
<p>The mind body spirit thing rang true. Trust can kill a person if they blindly believe there's a poison in their food because someone said it, it'll heighten their anxiety, effecting their body in ways they don't see.</p>
<p>To then quarantine people from seeing loved ones for 15 days behind closed doors? It's appalling that nobody sees through this, what I'd call, psychological warfare.</p>
<p>We all see just how fear has changed the world alone in a years time.</p>

        <p>Except retired baseball legend Hank Aaron who died 3 weeks after taking the vax. Of course the media have fact-checked this to death, saying there's not enough evidence to make the connection. Their source? Medical experts who say, "There's no evidence" and that he died peacefully. His preexisting conditions were arthritis and a hip replacement. Hmmm.</p>

        <p>As someone who owns and operates a business, I know and interact with more people than average by a significant margin. Across provincial (Canadian) and national borders. I've traveled interprovincially pretty well as per usual since the start of all this.  </p>
<p>During all that time and through all of those interactions, I have met ONE customer who actually had the coof. He was in his early 40's. Described it as a "kind of bad" cold that affected him for a couple of days. He recovered on his own and hasn't had any issues since. I've heard various secondhand tales of so-and-so's uncle or fourth cousin who had it. Nobody in my sphere of family (extended included), friends, or regular customers has died "with" or "from" (lol) COVID. And I have gone out of my way to inquire about this, too.  </p>
<p>Now maybe I'm just defying the odds? I do have the devil's own luck, after all. But maybe, given the numbers, the odds are actually greater that any given individual won't know anyone who has contracted the virus, let alone died from it. Possibly because, globally, only 0.004% of the population has died. "With" COVID, I might add. Factor in the comorbidity rates (95\~% by all accounts), and that number will drop significantly.</p>

        <p>Yep. Most people, even the elderly, recover without any issues. I believe the 70+ recovery rate is somewhere in the vicinity of 95%. And remember, the average life expectancy in the United States is 78. And elderly people with certain comorbidities, such as heart disease and diabetes, have an even lower range. For example, people with diabetes live an average of ten years less.  </p>
<p>It should not be remotely surprising to anyone when people with serious comorbidities, who are also within the average life expectancy range, up and, well, <em>die.</em> Do they expect everyone to live 20+ years beyond the average all of a sudden? If it was that common for people to live to 100, the average life expectancy would reflect that.   </p>
<p>The reality is that some people are just stronger than others. It's a fundamental truth of life that often gets swept under the rug because it's "mean" or "something-ist" or what have you.  </p>
<p>Naturally, acknowledging this tends to result in all kinds of accusations. Usually something to the effect of "Oh, so so so, you don't care about [X-group] of people!?"  </p>
<p>It's impossible to be able to protect everyone all of the time. And it's unreasonable to expect it.</p>

        <p>It's just an average. If you do your best to eat right, exercise regularly, and generally be as vigilant as possible, you'll improve your chances. I don't think having had COVID will impact your long-term outlook, especially if you're still relatively young.</p>

        <p>it's not unreasonable to expect to protect others. It's unreasonable to stop trying. You may be so brave and bold with your "statistics" because you deem yourself one of those "strong", apparently. But if you touch statistics, won't measures to protect others bring better statistics and better survival? It of course will not increase the mean life expectancy, how convenient to you. But it will increase the chances of others just to reach that average number, won't it? I don't mind people around me having less odds at surviving. Shouldn't we always try to achieve the best in all areas?</p>

        <p>How <em>convenient</em> for you to leave out the part where I said <em>"all of the time".</em> I never made any of the assertions that you're strawmanning me with here.  </p>
<p>I never said to "stop trying". I made factual statements about reality.  </p>
<p>I said nothing for or against any "achievements" in any areas. That's an extremely broad statement to make on its face as it is, and is a completely separate issue.  </p>

        <p>This has been my experience as well. Now I don't operate a business, but I do work with a LOT of people. Several hundred people in my building and roughly 20+ guys in my department alone. We had an 'outbreak' last October-November when the numbers started to kick up again but nobody could figure out why. We were required to wear masks, social distance as best we could and any equipment we had to share had to be cleaned after each use.</p>
<p>Somehow the virus spread through not only my department, but most of the building as well. In my department out of the 20 or so guys, roughly 15 of them not including myself got the virus and was sent home for 10 days. When each guy came back I asked them what did it do to them. The funny thing was, all of them said it was like the flu.</p>
<p>Of all the guys who got it, all of them were over it in a few days. I asked what their symptoms were. They all said they had like a sore throat and a bit of a cough, but it was, "no big deal." It honestly made me wonder, if they all just had a cold or a case of the actual flu. It made no sense to me when all of them described the exact same thing and all of them getting over it in a matter of 3-4 days. In fact, they all said that after about 4-5 days they felt completely fine and just enjoyed a week off with pay. Its made me skeptical about the whole thing since.</p>
<p>I do know for a fact, that one guy had a confirmed case. He was out for nearly 3 weeks. This was in March or April of last year. My building has roughly 500 employees, from what I have heard from our county, there has been only a total of 2 confirmed cases in my facility. It makes me wonder how accurate the tests really are. I feel a lot of the guys who were sent home got a false positive. I expected guys to be out several weeks. Not be over it in a few days.</p>

        <p>Hmm. I'd be curious to know what the general state of health was for the one guy who was out for weeks.  </p>
<p>Would be willing to bet that he's overweight/obese, or has at least one other serious underlying health issue. Diabetes, heart problems, etc.</p>

        <p>I had it for 4 weeks this past January. I'm a healthy, thin, 27 year old. Eat and exercise just fine. I would not wish COVID on my worst enemy. </p>
<p>I was able to recover from home, luckily, but there were a few times when I considered going to the hospital because I couldn't breathe. </p>
<p>I do know many people who had it for only a few days. It's crazy how differently it can affect people, but I think it's important to know that not everyone who gets hit hard is overweight or has an underlying medical condition.</p>

        <p>Hmm. Well, the vast majority are overweight and have known underlying comorbidities (as per the CDC itself - 95%, with an average of four comorbidities). And I have a strong suspicion that the "healthy" people actually do have some sort of underlying issue that has heretofore gone unnoticed. Not unlike the numerous documented occasions where high-level athletes have suddenly dropped dead on the field/court due to undiagnosed congenital heart issues.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't believe that any agency has actually kept track of precisely how many "young and healthy" individuals have contracted COVID, let alone what their specific experiences were with it.  </p>
<p>Myself...well, I would be willing to bet a goodly sum of money that such individuals are <em>vanishingly rare.</em> I have only ever heard of it via vague media reports and a handful of anecdotal accounts (such as yours) on the internet. Based on that, along with everything else, I am not even remotely inclined to believe that young/healthy individuals are at anywhere near any sort of significant risk.</p>

        <p>I think the biggest fact you're overlooking is that the people who die from complications from covid wouldn't have died if covid wasn't around. It's like blaming diabetes for a car crash - that person would have died eventually anyway, car crashes are mostly survivable! Who needs seat belts? </p>
<p>You really like mentioning comorbidities but the fact still remains covid took those people's lives when they may have lived for years or decades longer.</p>

        <p>I'm not overlooking anything. I'm looking straight at it. <em>Complications</em> are almost always contributing factors to a majority of elderly people and people who have serious illnesses. Their immune systems are stressed and essentially cease to function. At that point, they can die from things that are extremely common and generally non-lethal to younger and healthier people.  </p>
<p>Kindly fuck off with your dumb <em>Seatbelts™</em> defense. It makes no sense. Although, incidentally, the CDC actually did include car crashes in their COVID tally. They have a category listing "intentional/unintentional events", lol.  </p>
<p>How many octogenarians with diabetes, cancers, and heart disease do you actually think will live "decades" longer? The entire US only has 97,000 people at or above the age of 100.  </p>
<p>We know that the majority of these people were in the average life expectancy range and had an average of four comorbidities. Your assertion that they "would have lived for decades longer" is speculative and ridiculous. If they didn't die with COVID, they would have died with other complications. And, in fact, they did, because pneumonia and influenza (didn't actually disappear) are also listed in tandem with COVID in a large volume of cases. Which are both conditions that frequently contribute to the eventual deaths of elderly and sick people.  </p>
<p>What I'm taking <em>issue</em> with is the bald-faced lie of "young and healthy" people dropping dead "from" COVID.</p>

        <p>It's not a serious illness for a lot of people.  Cases are extremely more common than deaths for a reason.  We're being so crazy cautious about it not because it's gonna kill you, but because if you go about your normal life you could infect three hundred people, who could go on to infect three hundred people each, causing dozens of deaths that don't happen if you stay home.</p>

        <p>At this point, nobody even expects anyone to stay at home, wear a mask, and/or get vaccinated. That's the new normal, and I suppose against the ethos of this sub. I'm excited to go to county fairs, demo derbies, air shows, etc. I'm vaccinated, but would still go to this stuff regardless. If you're not vaccinated, that's fine too, everyone in the US has been given the chance at this point.</p>

        <p>Their argument is, "the only reason you don't know anyone who died of the virus is because of lockdowns". Which is stupid because at the same time they go on about how lockdown by itself isn't effective enough so we also need the vax and the mask and the rest of it. Make up your mind, either the lockdown is so good that nobody you know got sick, or the lockdown isn't working so we have to do the other things too.</p>

        <p>So when forced to pick between the media or their own eyes, they should believe the media?</p>
<p>Most people intuitively believe that it's not a big deal. Back when covid videos were leaking out of China, and news hit that it was here in North America, I was avoiding stores at all cost. I bought a huge stockpile of food and I didn't go inside a grocery store for at least 2 full months after that. In my mind, a grocery store is the most likely place to catch it because that's where sick people NEED to be at some point since food is not an optional part of your life. People who think covid is not a real concern would continue to buy groceries on a weekly basis, and I can say the overwhelming majority of people fit into that category.</p>
<p>I also bought 12 pairs of P100 filters for my M3 half face respirator in the early covid days. I was very concerned about covid, so I bought a real mask that actually is rated to stop damn near anything. People who think covid is not a big deal would choose to wear whatever garbage mask costs the least and is not rated to stop even the most basic dust particles. As you can guess, probably 99% of the population is wearing useless masks because they believe covid is not a real problem.</p>
<p>We live in this bizarre situation where most people claim covid is a real problem but their actions scream that it's not a real problem.</p>

<p>as much as it sucks, yes.  because peoples world views are incredibly small.  people will be stuck in their own little towns, never leave their state, but still have very opinionated strong beliefs about world views and other races and cultures, despite being incredibly uncultured.  </p>
<p>of course don't believe EVERYTHING you see, but if your own eyes are your only source of information than you're going to have a very biased, secluded opinion.</p>

<p>I know it isn't fake. I know it's a real disease with potential deadly results. I don't trust the vaccine at all. I will never get it nor will my kids. And I don't feel like lockdowns did any good. Let people weigh the risks and live their lives how they see fit. </p>

        <p>I'm guessing your 38 year old neighbor wasn't a picture-perfect image of good health.</p>
<p>Just imagine if our government encouraged health instead of authoritarian measures that sadly worsened the average person's health.</p>
<p>In a nation of obesity... McDonalds, Taco Bell, Little Caesars --- peddlers of death --- were declared <em>essential</em> while the playgrounds that apartment children rely on for exercise were closed down.</p>
<p>Only the most naive, lowest rung of intelligence would support the lockdown measures and anyone with even a hint of awareness knows none of this was about saving lives. (This isn't directed at you, just in general.)</p>

        <p>Exactly, while I'm not in favor of government overreach in restrictions, if they seriously are that concerned about mitigating disease and death, they would've long ago restricted fast foods, driving, carcinogenic materials in construction, fat, sugar, even requiring licenses for using ladders, all leading causes of injury and death. </p>
<p>But all of these restrictions for a virus with a 1% mortality rate? Clownworld</p>
<p>There was a funny picture of a covid protestor holding a sign that read, "Mandate Vegetables".</p>

        <p>1% is a massive number for death rate of a pandemic. Also it is a lowball. But more importantly with a disease that could spread this much with us trying to reduce the spread, 1% of all those dying is big. </p>
<p>We do have restrictions on most of those things, we didn't end them because that would be massive government overreach to an extreme that most people would be heavily up in arms against.</p>
<p>Genuinely though I have to ask you, honest to God, you think what you just said makes a bit of fucking sense. You really think a ladder licensing program (what the fuck would they even teach you?) would have a significant impact on the US death total? And no that doesn't mean pull up the total numbers of US ladder deaths and pretend that they all would be prevented by this license program. I want you to tell me how many people you think a program telling them "don't fall" will save.</p>

        <p>Or another one of the covid doomers' favorites: Your anecdotal stories mean nothing. </p>
<p>Real life experiences can't be faked (when qualitative research methods properly applied), while numbers can easily be manipulated by corrupt doctos, i.e., right after Biden's inauguration the PCR test cycle threshold was lowered, and deaths among seniors were attributed to preexisting conditions rather than Covid.</p>

        <p>Seriously, that’s what I’ve been saying all along. The only people I know of that got sick, were family members of coworkers or friends, and they ALL said it was no big deal. Meanwhile, all over Reddit, apparently certain people have lost SEVERAL family members to covid... either a crock of shit or some weak fucking bloodlines. It’s almost like me NOT wearing a mask has prevented me and everyone I know from catching it.</p>

        <p>I lost my aunt. However, she was extremely diabetic, overweight, and smoked when she was younger. Here’s the kicker: I think they gave her the vaccine without telling us. Because she had no history of heart problems or blood clotting. Yet, when she was in the hospital with Covid suddenly she had blood clots and a couple went to her brain and she stroked. Her death was weird and my family is too hurt right now to really push it.</p>

        <p>Grandmother of a friend “died from Covid”, but family members said she had a stroke. 
Mother and a few others got it to varying degrees but were all fine within 2 weeks. 
One customer who was obese, with diabetes &amp; other health problems died with Covid. 
I’ve yet to hear of a single person: family, friends, customers and vendors; who died from Covid without major preexisting conditions.</p>

        <p>15 months and still I do not know anyone in the proximity nor among extended acquaintances who even had nasty covid symptoms, let alone someone who died. I doubt even this outer, second circle knows anyone who died of covid. Honestly, if it was not for the constant media fear mongering and daily prayers to the <em>holy numbers</em>, I would have no idea that a <em>deadly global pandemic</em> was raging on.</p>
<p>Yet plenty of people who lost jobs, livelihood, mental health in the process, many succumbed to heavy alcohol and drugs over this ordeal. All in the name of public health.</p>

The only person I know who has Died from it was my Grandpa and he actually died from Mersa in his system, but the death cert said Covid since he tested positive for a whole month while in and out if the hospital, yet myself and 5 other people who took care of him in his home somehow never got it from him despite no masks or caution on our end.</p>

        <p>Same, don’t know a single person who needed treatment for COVID. I’ve been saying this to my friends and family since this all began, but they always answer with the “possible late complications” argument , like loss of smell. Somehow that to them justifies the lockdowns. People are easily scared and trust the government, I guess.</p>

I could put all my focus into school and get paid. Don't get me wrong though. I'm fucking tired of all this shit though.

        <p>ditto one person over 70 I know went to the hospital cuz he thought he had it--  he tested negative-- they told him to give up smoking which he did cuz he struggled to breath.  Been smoking since he was 14 years old.  Another diabetic gal thought she was going to die when she got diagnosed.  But she got better.  She didnt' think she had the covid but after being sick for two weeks she went to the doctor and tested positive.  But she wasn't so sick that she actually expected to test positive.  myth or fact more people in Japan killed themselves then the number that died of covid.</p>

        <p>I HAVE met plenty of people with relatives that have died of covid....so they claim. 
When I press the subject I usually find that the family member was: morbidly obese, had life-threatening hear and lung issues for years, kidney failure, and being 92 years old...
I "gently" remind them that dying WITH covid is not the same as dying FROM covid...</p>

        <p>My family member died of covid, she was obese and old, though. She was put on a respirator and the next morning, she died. I still do not claim that because her death, I have the right to impose anything on other people, and that others should be restricted for my 'safety' (safety in quotation marks bc I've had covid already, so I got the antibodies, and even before that, there was a very slim chance of anything happening to me).</p>

        <p>I know more people who had serious adverse side-effects after getting vaccinated than people who got seriously ill with Covid. The latter group had no symptoms or just a little sniffles, while two of the first group mentioned had to be hospitalized and one now suffers from an autoimmune disease.</p>

        <p>Snap. Everybody in my circle has been as fit as a fiddle this entire time yet a handful of them couldn't roll their sleeves up quick enough. It's shocking how many people trust the TV more than their own eyes and instincts.</p>
<p>And condolences to everybody who's lost somebody. One of my old schoolmates tapped out a few months into lockdown and it still hurts despite having only spoken briefly since school. I'd meant to reconnect for years, but now I'll never get the chance... Thanks to a virus with a 99% recovery rate.</p>

        <p>Same. I know a lot of people, young and old, with and without serious health conditions. Many who ignored lockdowns and carried on with life as much as they could. None of them died or even went to the hospital. I live in a major metropolitan area that the media said was being devastated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>I’m not especially lucky and neither are my family and friends. A rational person would at least wonder why covid decided to completely avoid my entire social circle.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I do know someone personally but i also know 7 people personally who died of cancer 12 people who have died of heart attacks and 2 from OD or suicide. Beyond count those with diabetes, many still with cancer beyond count those that have autoimmune disease, beyond count those with heart disease. In life people die.

        <p>I broke up with my My now-ex girlfriend because she lost her mind during quarantine. She was ‘exposed’ at work (though she and everyone else tested negative) and had to be in isolation for 2 weeks. We video chatted twice a day every day, but She became increasingly unstable and extremely angry. After a month she still never went back to normal and refused to see a therapist about it. I’m still heartbroken because she was the most human I’ve ever had the lucky privilege of dating.</p>

Otherwise the only people I know who have died from it have been very tangential, ie my friends long lost great uncle who was wheelchair bound in a nursing home, and a mutual friends 90+ year old grandma. </p>
<p>But tangentially I know at least 2 people who died shortly after getting vaccinated as well. My friends mom's friend, and one of my parents friends grandmother. </p>
<p>I also personally knew 2 people who died of drug overdose, the most tragic being a long time family friend of mine. He was a father of 4 with 2 young kids, who lost his job due to the "pandemic."</p>

        <p>I’ve said this repeatedly. It took over a year into the pandemic before I could say I knew a person WHO KNEW a person who even had covid, let alone died. Not saying people didn’t die, but something has been off about the message versus the lived experience.</p>

        <p>Anecdotal (as is your post), but two of my friends lost parents. They were only in their 50s. My father had it, most the people I worked with during the pandemic had it. </p>
<p>My county only lost 245 people but that’s out of 9,500 cases. The population of my city is only 40,000–a little under half the population of the county. Still, those are bad numbers. </p>
<p>The point is, your personal experience has nothing to do with it. Don’t know anyone who died from it? Good for you but what is your point? </p>
<p>This subreddit sure does reek of conspiracy nonsense for one that is supposed to only be about personal freedoms. At some point you went from not wanting to wear masks to calling the vast majority of others sheep. And through all that fuss, you will ignore the statistics that say this all helped the pandemic be much less impactful than it could have been. The overlap here with the willfully ignorant conspiracy nuts is frightening. For every thoughtful member, there is ten yahoos who misunderstood 1984.</p>

        <p>Piaget said object permanence is usually grasped by about 8 months. New studies show that object permanence is actually grasped by toddlers by 4-7 months. Toddler empathy typically occurs around 2 years of age. This means that by two years of age toddlers generally understand that other people exist when they are not actively perceiving and that those same people feel and experience things that they themselves may not currently be experiencing. This subreddit seems to have not grasped either concept. If perhaps a new psychological study on what occurs when toddlers do not go through the typical stages of development would be performed 76 thousand subjects for study may be found here.</p>

        <p>A young gentleman from africa I know from gaming said some relatives of his died of Covid.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theory by me: I had the feeling this shit was especially targetting african blacks and arabians. Like it was made to target them. I never told him, and I had this thought since last year, I only know this young lad for a couple of weeks now.</p>
<p>But the numbers last year just were pointing to a larger amount of diseased people with that clear descend. So much that stupid germany pushed "anti racism campaigns" in regards of covid victims because we had so many idiots from these people in our hospitals.</p>
<p>Thing however is- these people who live in germany here don't accept any rules, advices and never stop breeding nor gathering in massive groups to fight each other or have family festivities or some bullshit.</p>
<p>I am not sure. It seems targeted. But also people are acting irresponsible.</p>
<p>Which is both equally worrysome. Spreaders but also defined targets. Not good.</p>

        <p>Do we lock down because of cancer? Do we ruin the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people because of cancer? Do we ruin small and micro businesses that people have spent their entire lives building from the ground up because of cancer? Do we cause immense psychological damage, predominantly to young and developing minds, the effects of which will likely be observed for decades to come, because of cancer?</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, the measures we've been enforcing for the past 15 months are a bit disproportionate to the threat at hand? Ever given that a thought?</p>

        <p>Lockdowns don't work. Not only are they not a "small price" to pay (which is an incredibly condescending thing to say to say, mind you), it is a price that needn't be paid because they in fact do not help stop the spread, the only thing they do is cause unnecessary harm. I'm sorry that you're oblivious to this.</p>
<p>Also, 550,000 have died <strong>with</strong> Covid/SARS-CoV-2, not from Covid.</p>

        <p>Screw this mind set!  </p>
<p>I lost my grandpa on Xmas day, the day before his 96th birthday. </p>
<p>Yeah he was 95, we knew he wasn’t long for this world...</p>
<p>He was a 30 yr police vet, and WWII Marine. </p>
<p>This man was clean up crew at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, everyday him and his platoon gave 1/2 their rations to kids who would come to their encampment. </p>
<p>These kids were 4,5,6 armed with slop buckets, they would just dump 1/2 of whatever mess gave them in to said buckets. </p>
<p>They didn’t want anymore of these kids, or their siblings, and parents to die...</p>
<p>That wanted to do the best they could, how they could; they were kids too. </p>
<p>He was a police sergeant who drew his gun twice and once was a loud opossum. </p>
<p>(Admittedly he did say they used to kick the crap out of suspects)</p>
<p>He saw some value in the lives of those poor kids in Japan. </p>
<p>It wasn’t hard for him, he grew up in the depression.</p>
<p>If he saw a “shiny” on the ground he picked it up. </p>
<p>Bottle caps, nails, pennies; scratching out a life was cherished and respected. </p>
<p>He did not deserve to die alone in a drug induced coma....</p>
<p>He gave a shit about human life even during a time a war... but your oppressed?</p>
<p>Business may have closed, people may have been put out of work...</p>
<p>Those people have one thing in common, a life!</p>

        <p>If COVID had been allowed the same freedom of dispersal as the Black Death (and, remember they had no germ theory and no knowledge that rodents and fleas were carriers) and people were in total ignorance about it and personal hygiene and there were no toilet paper 🧻 you may have seen an entirely different scenario. No modern medicine. No disinfectants. No warnings. No. It is not possible to compare the two. That’s why Bubonic Plague is not really a problem nowadays.</p>

        <p>&rt;That’s why Bubonic Plague is not really a problem nowadays.</p>
<p>Ppl that survived were pretty much immune to it. We re their descendants. Even if it isn't a problem nowadays, the bubonic plague is still going on, still kills a couple of ppl a year, and could potentially rise again to become a worldwide problem. I'm also sure, more ppl would have died from covid if we had the same standards like in the middle ages. Just like ppl died more from the flu back then ... You know, ppl even died from little cuts that resulted in major infections ... All true.<br>
But, with a 0,025% death ratio a year, you won't convince me we have a health issue in the world ...  </p>
<p>Also, lockdowns were irrelevant, because ppl still took public transport on a dayly basis :) The lockdown restrictions only prevented you from seeing your friends and family, or go outside passed 10pm. They didn't prevent you from being squeezed with thousands of other ppl in a metal box called bus or subway ... :D</p>

        <p>Where I live traffic ceased. Buses ran and were free! but were practically empty. The trains were running but were empty too. The hospitals were filling up and the respiratory ventilators were in short supply. The hospital ship Mercy docked at the harbour for non-COVID cases. The lockdowns gave the world a chance to stop and take a “moment” to realise that the world is not the same as it was the year before. And allowed the world to gear up for the fight to come.</p>

        <p>Based on your name you were born in 1989. That would make you 32. If your mom had you when she was 25, your mom would be 57. If your grandmother had your mom when she was 25, that would make her 82 when she died.</p>
<p>Life expectancy is 79. For that to be an average, it means about half the people die below that age and half above it.</p>

        <p>She died late summer/early fall when it could've been prevented.  But you guys are so beyond selfish you couldn't do a simple things like wearing a mask and social distance despite seeing it work all over the world in many places that it work and before you tell me to prove it, places like New Zealand, South Korea, Iceland, and Taiwan all responded appropriately and didn't have to suffer through it like we did here in the states.</p>
<p>So yes, it is your fault.  It doesn't matter if my grandma was 30 or 100 she still died from covid especially when it was preventable.  And to get back to the original point of the thread is you guys denying that people are dying from the virus,  it's messed up you guys would do that when there has been over 500k people just in the United States who have died.</p>
<p>You guys are all assholes here, but you saying it's ok that my grandma died because you assume she was over the average lifespan makes you so much fucking worse.</p>

<p>You know what would have helped your grandmother? Ivermectin, especially, or one of the other Covid-19 treatments which were suppressed by pharmaceutical companies that had to hide treatments in order to justify billions in vaccine profits.</p>
<p>Again, we are not your enemy. The organizations for which you advocate are the ones that used you, and the death of your family member.</p>
<p>The point about age &amp; death isn't about it being "okay" that she died. It's just what happens when people get old. It will happen to you, and it will happen to me. It will happen to all of us.</p>

        <p>Just take a step back and think how you got here.  You're telling a stranger on the internet that it's ok his grandma died from an illness that could've been prevented because people die of illnesses all the time. How dare she try and live as long as she could so she can enjoy her life like traveling or seeing her family grow up and see who they become.</p>

        <p>Sigh. </p>
<p>Old and sick people are at risk? Let them stay indoors.</p>
<p>You can't lockdown an entire globe of people because people who are already past their expiration date are going to die. They are dying regardless.</p>
<p>I can't state this more clearly -- old people die. It doesn't mean I am happy about it or that I don't care, it's just a fact of life that locking down a nation and taking school away from children and shutting down small businesses isn't going to fix.</p>
<p>Most of this is to cover up an economic collapse and to profit on vaccine sales, anyway though. That's why the people you're defending covered up the effective treatments of Ivermectin and other solutions.</p>

<p>This isn't about throwing links at each other. I'm here to gather more understanding of what's actually happening in the world and you have nothing to offer me in that regard -- just snarky fallacies and unpleasant interaction.</p>
<p>Very seriously, if you really want to understand what's happening look through those links.</p>
<p>There's more. There's a timeline. There's the World Bank Pandemic Bonds sold in 2017 which didn't pay off due to the "pandemic" -- and I believe that was likely a money laundering scheme to finance this operation globally.</p>
<p>Nothing is "conspiracy theory" like you're going to assume it is. Nothing is hidden. Everything is right out in the open, similar to how politicians get million dollar speaking engagements after they leave office. (That is money paid for legislation passed while in office -- right in front of our eyes.)</p>
<p>It's all right there out in the open, but you have to open your mind and actually use your brain to see the connections.</p>
<p>I'm bowing out of this conversation now because very seriously I don't think you have an honest intent here and you're just wasting my time. But I strongly advise spending an hour or two considering those links.</p>
<p>And just think for a moment - what IF your understanding of what is happening right now is incorrect?  What you'll find is --- suddenly all the little things in the back of your mind that actually don't make sense about how this virus was handled... Those things will make sense when you realize nothing is what it appears to be on the surface.</p>
<p>But like I said, it's all hidden in plain sight. You just have to look at it, and you have to think.  And get out of the mindset of stupid forum trolling and internet battles.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'm done here.</p>

<p>The real tragedy is the people that have lost a job or been told to wear a mask for a year and then continue living a normal life after this is over.

        <p>Exactly. But it's done. It already spread a long time ago. We all carry it, and when your immune system drops, you get the cold. So what are we supposed to do? Should we allow another one? Double the death toll? How about a third one?</p>
