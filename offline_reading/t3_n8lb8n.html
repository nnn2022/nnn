On billionaires getting far richer with this pandemic.</p>
<p>The other one, it is just common sense:<br>
- Big corps are the only allowed businesses.</p>
<p>- Independent/hood stores and bars have been closed for a long time, with a lot of them murdered already.</p>
<p>- Trillions of dollars printed in USA and all these shady "help packages" in the European Union, not to mention the vaxes and the increase on taxes happening in some countries and on the way for the rest. All of which the taxpayer will pay, while the wages will be frozen or go down.</p>

Some people believe it while some people are going along because of fear. They think they are doing the right thing while ignoring all the damage.</p>

        <p>Permanent power and a transitioning of a political system where there needs to be no pretense to people having any voice.</p>
<p>Could be that the intent is for a global authority to be established- perhaps ultimately to be expanded to where local governments are less relevant.</p>
<p>There are numerous theoretical possibilities.  The fact that we've been fucked with and bullshitted for over a year says that whatever end game we're being told quite likely isn't true.</p>

        <p>They have been pushing climate change for decades and they have reached their Thunbergish crescendo and still folks didn't give a fuck. </p>
<p>Not really an election issue, beachfront property prices keep rising faster than any other property prices and the American economy thriving.</p>
<p>They needed to jump start their climate change agenda because a grand solar minimum is coming and they need to take credit for the world cooling. If they didn't run with covid now, decades of propaganda and preparations are wasted. The world cools while no one takes any action, the whole world mocks the UN, IPCC and globalist technocrats. They are exposed and they are worse off than square 1. </p>
<p>By hyping a bad flu season, they have already got a lot of the planned climate change transitions in place almost instantly and without much objection. </p>
<p>All the small businesses go bankrupt and forfeit all the rights they have grandfathered in. The new climate change regulations make it difficult for new companies to open and you have a few large scale globalist companies, who wrote the regulations and passed them to different governments to enact as law to thwart competition, in charge. </p>
<p>My wife says, thank god, they didn't propose a UBI...lol. I mean, they have had one in place for 14 months and she still thinks it's a theoretical proposal. They didn't propose it because they are already doing it. We have been paying people $2k a month to do nothing all day and folks wonder why people aren't complaining. The government has wanted this, and restricted air travel, in place for a long time and they are already done deals without the public realizing it. </p>
<p>Only globalist policies will save the day and we have had them stuffed down our throat without thought or debate for 14 months.  Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein. A disease so considerate that it let them pursue population control, rewrite the economy in the way they've been pushing towards for decades and remove the foundation from the citizenry and place the citizens squarely and completely on their platform.</p>
