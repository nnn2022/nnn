        <p>I am a person who has struggled with weight my entire life. I'm middle-aged now but when I was much younger I decided I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. Yes that's a cliche for a lot of things but I got to that point thankfully earlier in my life. I was tired of always being the fat girl. I lost 85 lbs. My mom who also struggled with weight and lost and kept a lot of it off said to me once when you're ready can lose it easily but not until you're ready. She was right. I lied to myself for years saying diets didn't work on me and a million other excuses. But when I was ready it came off.</p>
<p>We are never going to have a society of people that are only at a healthy weight. There will always be a range of skinny, average size and fat people but what I don't get with people like this is, you had an entire year where you lived in extreme fear and Terror for your life because of your weight. If that wasn't your wake-up call what exactly is it going to take? Are you ever going to stop doing this to yourself? </p>
<p>And I'm going to make an assumption here that may not be true but I'm guessing that these people are the sort of people that called everyone else selfish and horrible and uncaring because we didn't want to stop living our lives, wear masks and stay inside for an entire year to save their lives. Expecting others to care more about them than they care about themselves. I don't feel badly for these people at all. If they were actually trying to be healthy and not just creating organizations that allow them to do nothing about their health and their size I could at least get on board with being more considerate. But I'm sick and tired people putting the onus on others all the time. It's not my job to worry about you. If you are THAT terrified and you feel that helpless maybe it's time to take control and do what you can and stop acting like it's all on other people to save you.</p>

        <p>Maintenance is a million times harder than losing. I've gotten pretty good at losing but keeping it off is the real challenge. That said once you successfully do it, you know you can do it and you know how it feels to have a healthy size body, it's definitely worth fighting for!</p>

        <p>It's the same with all addiction really. I gave up smoking, drinking and all kinds of drugs over the years and then switched to over eating and shopping instead. Eventually I realised it was all about trying to fill an emotional hole in me which could never be filled with 'stuff'</p>
<p>You're right though. Once you manage to give something up, you know you can do it again and you can also do it with other addictions.</p>

        <p>My wife worked with one of these "size stigma victims".  This person was over 100 pounds overweight.  If their doctor told them they needed to lose weight, then they found another doctor.</p>
<p>How can you help someone if you're not allowed to inform them of their medical conditions?  What if doctors stopped telling people they have cancer or heart failure because it might hurt their feelings?</p>
<p>Yes, I was a fat kid, and I got bullied for it.  It sucks, but that doesn't change the fact that it's extremely unhealthy.</p>

        <p>&rt; A 1982 survey of doctors found that the only people held in lower esteem than those with high BMI were people with drug addiction, alcoholism and mental illness.</p>
<p>Is not being able to control your eating is addiction. So doctors don't like treating addicts. Possibly because addicts lie all the time.</p>
<p>Just look at the show "secret eaters". Unless it's all fake, people routinely lie about how much they eat.</p>
<p>Or my 600 pound life where they say they barely eat.. But haven't lost weight.</p>
<p>That would be extremely frustrating for doctors.</p>
