    <strong>I'm not sick. I'm not symptomatic. I'm not asymptomatic. I'm not staying home. I don't need a mask. I dont need a vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm healthy.</p>
<p>We've been conditioned to think anyone and everyone is sick and potentially dangerous to us. This is completely insane, divisive, and illogical. I will never accept that idea into my heart.</p>
<p>I deserve to be treated like a normal person, not a disease carrier. I won't stay home or wear a mask if I'm healthy because I cannot harm anyone if <strong>I'm not sick</strong>.</p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Lots of "How do you know you're not asymptomatic?"</p>
<p>All I ask you is to consider that this the question has held us hostage for the last year. Guilty until proven healthy is not a way we should treat others.</p></p>

        <p>the same logic applies to the anti-vaxxers. Just by not getting a chicken pox (or any other one) you will automatically be infecting their children and the "vulnerable " people. It makes no sense at all.</p>

        <p>The fact they kept pushing "asymptomatic" is what really got with people. If they just said "stay away from sick people" it wouldn't be as bad.</p>
<p>I wonder. Do other viruses just sit in the body before doing damage? Because the idea of carrying the virus around and spreading it while having absolutely no symptoms of any kind just doesn't make sense to me.</p>

        <p>I think they've done studies that show that asymptomatic transmission is BS. There are viruses like that though that go through a lysogenic phase after combining and replicating with cellular DNA. I don't think you can infect others during that time though.</p>

        <p>The only thing I've found is that asymptomatic carriers have the same viral load in their nasal passages as symptomatic carriers, but they never tried to explain how the virus would be transmitted in the absence of symptoms like coughing and sneezing.

        <p>&rt; The only thing I've found is that asymptomatic carriers have the same viral load in their nasal passages as symptomatic carriers</p>
<p>Is this because the virus enters through the nasal passage? So what the virus does after that is dependant on the person and their immunity/health, correct?</p>
<p>If so, I see clearly where wording was used to convince everyone that asymptomatic people were unknowingly “spreading covid”. Because most people don’t understand we have viruses in us all the time, but a lot of the time our bodies just fight them off. So technically the covid virus could be “in” you but does nothing unless it gets a foothold and starts causing symptoms.</p>

        <p>The brief article I read didn't explain if the virus had supposedly entered through the nasal passage or if that's where the replicating virus accumulated.  Either way, they never drew a connection between having the virus and spreading it.  In short, it was inconclusive.</p>

<p>This.  Never mind that we went over this exact thing for years in AIDS education: there are hundreds of different germs every one of us is carrying, that are too weak to even be noticed by anyone with an even marginally functional immune system.  They're like the really pathetic burglars that can't even get over the picket fence, so the rottweiler doesn't bother to wake up.</p>

        <p>The only way to be carrying a virus with no symptoms is to have no immune system and a virus that produces no symptoms on its own.  (Most symptoms we associate with colds are in fact products of our immune system. Fever, cough, runny nose, congestion, sneezing are all attempts by our immune systems to expel the disease.)</p>
<p>Viruses don't just hang about, they replicate, and ANY virus left unchecked can be extremely deleterious or fatal.  If they're not being fought, they're multiplying, so no, they don't just sit around able to spread but not expressing symptoms.</p>
<p>(cavteats: yes, there are exceptions, viruses that behave differently/uniquely (covid isn't one of them), or colds that seem to lie dormant for weeks, possibly in the body (interesting antarctic case of colds popping up and spreading 17 weeks after lockdown) but these aren't contagious in this case)</p>

        <p>Your initial assertion is completely incorrect and your caveat is so broad that it seems like you already know that. HSV, for example, can lie dormant for years or even decades and reactivate, hence some people will seemingly randomly get cold sores at different points in their lives. This is actually not atypical for a virus at all and lots of them act in this way. The same is true for bacteria. Why the reactivation occurs is often not understood, however.</p>

        <p>Yes, there are exceptions to pretty much any classification biology has ever made.  Coronaviruses however all behave in line with most contagious diseases when it comes to immune response and transmission, because most airborne diseases use our immune responses as  the transmission mechanism.  Also keep in mind that most diseases that lie dormant for months or years between outbreaks also aren't contagious except during those outbreaks, herpes among them.  This is broadly the category of wounds or sores that spread via touch when exposed, but otherwise don't have a straightforward way to convey.</p>
<p>For a more complete discussion we can go in to categories of diseases and spread, discuss bloodborne pathogens and their limitations (really MUCH easier to avoid spreading for the same reasons), etc., but the original generalization is still accurate, because it takes a significant quantity of virus to spread, as well as a vector, and since (again, most) diseases live inside us, they need a way out, created by their behavior, our immune response, other injury, waste routes, or death/decomposition (and we're pretty good at limiting exposure to several of those in modern countries).</p>

        <p>Herpes is absolutely transmissible during asymptomatic phase, that is without the presence of sores. Viral shedding of genital HSV occurs \~half as frequently in asymptomatic individuals as symptomatic but it does occur. This is very well known as many people contract genital herpes because they're unaware that their partner is infected.</p>
<p>What you're saying regarding airborne disease seems logical on the surface but is inaccurate. Influenza, for example, can be shed via quiet breathing and thus, again, doesn't require symptomatology (coughing/sneezing). It is true that asymptomatic individuals shed lower viral loads but it isn't true that it does not occur. This is of course ignoring the role of fomites in disease whereby anybody can carry the virus externally and transmit between mediums (obviously these people don't need to actually be infected themselves to become vectors - perhaps a pedantic point but still relevant).</p>

        <p>When you get to airborne transmissibility you are entirely in the realm of stats, with huge orders of magnitude between observed outcomes.  Just like with PCR, when a 20 cycle result means a good chance of live virus being present, and 40 cycles means a very poor chance, we're talking about 1 million times the RNA content.</p>
<p>The difference between being in a small enclosed space with a symptomatic person for an extended period of time, which might lead to a reasonable chance of catching their disease, and an open space with an asymptomatic person for only a moment is similarly large.  This is why when you go out to a restaurant and hear someone with a cold, not everyone in the restaurant suddenly catches a cold, even though they're in the same space for an hour or so.  The viral load dissipates and your body encounters such a small quantity as to be irrelevant, either not making it past passive immune defenses or being defeated by an active immune response so minor as to be unnoticed.</p>
<p>I'd love to see some other studies, but so far everything I've seen discussing viral shedding of asymptomatic people focuses on PCR or similar detection of rna, not live virus, and not actual verified transmission...probably because such testing is MUCH more expensive and time consuming, to both verify RNA in other patients, and live virus, and immune system activation, and illness.</p>
<p>I've really become retroactively skeptical of a lot of these studies that rely so heavily on lab condition detection of specimens and not real-world empirical studies, when you should need both to make any convincing argument.  (Not to derail, but masks can be effective at certain things, and are in labs, but fail to show any impact on community or population levels.)  If you don't account for the fact that while there may be viral rna present in the exhalation of a person who isn't sick, but has encountered the virus, the quantity may not be enough to actually infect someone else without extremely close and prolonged contact (kissing?) you haven't really made a compelling argument.</p>
<p>I will admit that biology isn't my primary field of study, but it is my wife's, who is a PhD and professor, and we have been discussing this ad nauseam (my fault, not hers) for months now.  I only bring the math/stats side to the discussions.  I've also lost most faith in the published science world after chief editors from places like NEJM, Lancet, and BMJ have all come out and said (in some cases years ago) extremely disparaging things about the quality, reproducability, and bias present in medical studies/journals.  (I do still read papers constantly, just take all assumptions and conclusions with a grain of salt, and become even more skeptical when it appears a novice bio grad student attempted to heavily employ python/R in their analysis, because it's hard enough for professional programmers who have been doing this for 30 years to ensure the math is pristine....and science code is almost never audited/reviewed.)</p>

        <p>Essentially, languages like python and R are becoming increasingly common in academic circles for the purposes of statistical analysis and data processing.  Even my wife, as a biologist, had to employ some one-off software to create approximate bounding regions for the animals she was studying based on the locations they were found in traps.  Even for students quite familiar with stats and the math involved, programming is usually fairly new to them, and there are a million pitfalls and ways to make subtle mistakes that can impact the outcome.  Life-long programmers all still struggle to keep errors from impacting the results of their code too greatly, so novices using python for their papers are unlikely to be aware of or employ the various tactics to reduce such errors.  (unit tests, functional programming styles, whatever, this is a huge can of worms :)  )  This is all understandable, but the code used in scientific papers is rarely included when a paper is submitted, and possibly never reviewed for simple reproducability, much less quality and accuracy.  The more students rely on amateur programming skills, the lower the average quality of paper, but typically this just means a greater likelihood of the outcome matching the expectations of the researcher.  (Far too often, we deem results of a study correct when they match our preconceived notions.)</p>
<p>The problem is really that for quality science, you need the actual scientists in their field working closely with quality statisticians who can check the math and ensure significance of findings, along with quality software developers to build and deploy the models and code and ensure their accuracy.....followed by reviewers from those 3 fields as well to assess each component.  This never happens.</p>
<p>For the record, I'm not a scientist, I'm a programmer, but having worked with my wife during her PhD and with a host of data science (but novice programmer) coworkers, it has become increasingly clear that I can't do stats and they can't program.</p>

        <p>You are right in saying that transmission is understudied and the majority will use shedding as a proxy which absolutely doesn’t hold the same weight. I will say that my earlier responses hold - asymptomatic transmission (not just shedding) has been shown in a broad range of viruses and that many viruses do lay dormant in the body without producing symptomatology - but that real-world data on asymptomatic spread of COVID is limited to case studies so I can’t say with any confidence that asymptomatic spread is a main driver, which I have never said. I think that it’s a shame that you’ve lost faith in publications. I have a number of publications in medical journals (largely descriptive analyses on niche cardiac pathologies) and that there is a rigorous peer review process - my first paper took 6 years to publish because it was returned so many times for revision. Small journals are often predatory and will look for people desperate to publish and basically charge them through the nose to rush publication, but the large journals are, in my experience, well vetted. Perhaps it’s different with purely modelled data and I think skepticism here is sensible, in which case I would wait for meta-analyses which tend to draw out any heavily erroneous results.</p>

        <p>As I posted in another response, aside from the quality of peer review within the field in question, the peer review for the stats and software is pretty much nonexistent, or at least extremely inconsistent.  Actually, in 2020 thousands of covid papers were all rushed through with extremely short turnaround times (including the infamous cormen-drosten paper).  I don't doubt you have had papers in limbo for years, I've watched my wife fight that fight a few times, but that isn't the only story.  And when the editors-in-chief of major publications have lost faith in the review processes, who am I to argue?  (The post I had for their quotes was linked from r great reject apparently, so the link is gone and i can't find their quotes, grrr.)   The concern continues though:</p>
<p>https://forbetterscience.com/2020/06/05/would-lancet-and-nejm-retractions-happen-if-not-for-covid-19-and-chloroquine/</p>
<p>Meta-analysis is not a solution to the trends of approval through narrative matching, nor biases for positive results.  "We did all this and found nothing" doesn't get published as often, nor do articles, in the current climate, that question the severity of covid, the efficacy of masks or lockdowns, etc.  (See: the Danish mask study that took months to be released because no one would run it.)</p>
<p>All that aside, the original point here was that for the majority of diseases, and I will correct my original statement to limit it to respiratory diseases for the purposes of this discussion (although I maintain it's broadly true for contact-transmission viruses as well, but not bloodborne), if you have the disease, your body is fighting it if capable, and there are signs and symptoms.  If you have just encountered a pathogen, neither of these may have spun up or be visible yet.  On the other hand, if the infection is so minor compared to your available immune response, either because you already have antibodies or tcells, or the infection is too small, there is insufficient viral load to make spreading significant, if possible at all.  This is the exact reason that vaccines against pertussis, measles, varicella, polio, smallpox, whatever mean we don't have to treat everyone as a potential carrier or worry they might get sick upon exposure.  There is no reason to believe or assume covid is any different in this regard.  To wit: asymptomatics don't spread covid any better than they do all those other diseases we don't worry about any more.</p>

        <p>I can't disagree with anything you've said here and I agree that selection/reporting bias are a serious problem in academia, especially so in medical research.</p>
<p>I also agree that meta-analysis doesn't address the root problem but it is actually largely effective in weaning out poor methodology among multiple studies.</p>
<p>The root of the issue is clearly political in nature and so it will disproportionately affect areas of research that are politically relevant (as we see with COVID). This has always been an issue. I would still be incredibly wary of assumptive conclusions, though, regardless of how similar we may believe a certain pathogen to behave to previous, well-studied pathogens. I personally believe in erring on the side of caution when it comes to global pandemics but I will say that I've never stated that asymptomatic transmission is a driving mechanism in COVID-19 spread as I don't have evidence to make that assertion. Conversely, I also don't have evidence to say the opposite.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I also said in another comment chain that COVID mortality rates are likely overestimated but that they're not as inflated as many people here believe. The fact is that COVID has a very distinct clinical picture and mortality rates (in my country, I can't speak for others) are determined from death certification. The MCCD process is fairly rigorous and you can see my other comments for an explanation if you're interested. There are, without a doubt, some deaths attributed to COVID-19 which were actually a result of other causes, but in my experience from working acute med wards throughout the pandemic COVID produces a clear clinical sequalae and I'm confident that I could actually diagnose COVID without the need for testing (though I wouldn't, obviously) in the majority of individuals with severe disease.</p>

        <p>In the US, the official CDC guidelines go something like this (from cdc covid alert #2, march 24 2020): </p>
<p>you should count a covid death:</p>
<ul>
<li>if someone died from covid</li>
<li>is suspected to have died from covid</li>
<li>if covid contirbuted</li>
<li>if covid was suspected to have contributed</li>
<li>no test is necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also nearly the same as the official WHO direction.  Countries and states from all over have listed official policies as "if they had a positive pcr within x days of death, it's a covid death" and "even if they died from something else, if they had covid, we're counting it as a covid death."  There's the irish health minister video, the Illinois Director of public health (Ngozi Ezike) confirming everything that can be counted, is.  For a while the UK was counting anyone who ever tested PCR positive as a covid death.  I can't speak to your country, but plenty of countries have bent the definition as much as they can get away with.  I don't doubt that the "primary cause of death" can fairly effectively be diagnosed when desired, but the official counts aren't limited to that.  (In hospitals in the US and UK at least, a PCR positive means a covid hospitalization, regardless of reason for admission (the broken arm reference), and a covid hospitalization that becomes a death is necessarily a covid death, including literally hypovolemic shock from trauma, as per official direction.  There are actually direct financial incentives to hospitals that treat covid patients and handle covid deaths.)</p>
<p>From years in fire/rescue, my wife and I have a bunch of friends in nursing, and a couple who work in covid wards.  They agree with your assessment there, although their experiences also match the data, where the average age of a covid death is ~85 with multiple serious or life-ending comorbidities.  Late stage cancers, organ failures, that sort.  Counting renal failure with covid as a covid death strains the definition, given it's usually the major systems failures that allow covid to be as devastating as it is in those conditions.  Opportunistic, essentially.  It's a limitation of the death reporting systems, but in general, when an old family member finally succumbs, we don't say "she died of the flu, but also had stage 4 lung cancer."</p>
<p>So I believe we're probably over counting covid deaths substantially, I'd be surprised if more than 20-25% were genuinely caused by covid.  A FOIA of the Rhode Island PCR data showed seasonal fluctuations, but at most 50% and as little as 30% of the PCR cycles were in the "likely to actually be sick from covid" category.  There might be age-aligned biases here, but using PCR as the primary diagnostic means we're likely counting at least double, based on who even had covid at the time of death.</p>

        <p>I’m actually a doctor in the U.K. so I write and sign MCCDs. I’m not sure where your information is coming from but some things are incorrect. To copy from another comment:</p>
<p>“”We have fairly stringent definitions of cause of death - a) “the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death”, and then we give b) “disease/condition leading to [the above]” and, further, c) “other disease or condition leading to [the above]”, and finally “other significant conditions contributing to death but not related to cause”</p>
<p>So an example would be:
a) Pneumonitis
b) COVID-19
c) -
d) Diabetes Mellitus””</p>
<p>We would never sign off an unrelated death as COVID just because somebody once had COVID. That doesn’t happen. Somebody who has some traumatic injury and dies as a result of those injuries wouldn’t have COVID as a cause of death on their certificate.</p>
<p>I get what you’re saying RE those with malignant comorbidities, but we’ve never been allowed to use end-stage organ failure alone as cause of death. If somebody has end stage lung cancer, for example, and succumbs to COVID pneumonitis, one would typically say that there were 2 causes of death - both COVID-19 pneumonitis and lung cancer. This is reasonable as the pneumonitis led directly to death but the comorbidity would have been a potent exacerbating factor. These are typically considered when reporting COVID death statistics (which is why you’ll see “most deaths were in patients with X comorbidities,...”</p>

<p>https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-data-idUSKBN29J2TH</p>
<p>It seems that regardless of what you write down, the official national numbers include anyone that died within 28, or 60, (or early on, ANY number of days) since a positive test.  You are surely recording this correctly, but the national numbers take more factors in to account.  There really have been official UK government publications with the text &lt;some number&rt; deaths "from all causes within 28 days of a positive test".  Search engines are not my friend in finding these, and I'm getting tired of having to write "i had evidence but now i can't find it....sigh"</p>
<p>(From Illinois: "A spokesman for the state health department released a statement saying it's up to coroners to hold the state accountable for accurate death records." after the coroner complained ""The red flag that I'm raising is the Illinois Department of Public Health numbers on COVID deaths is not an accurate number," Hill said. "We've reviewed several of these cases. The decedent had no condition at the time of death that would warrant a 'COVID death,' yet the state is still putting those statistics as a 'COVID death.'"  It's unclear in this case whether the doctors wrote something inappropriate, the coroner was wrong, or the official cause of death is different than the doctor's record, but the state admits "Just today, a medical examiner reported to IDPH a death previously reported as COVID-19 was due to an overdose and should be changed, which we have done.")</p>
<p>I think the point is that 100-200k (in the US) people dying with covid as well as cancer or organ failure shouldn't be concerning because it's on par with two consecutive flu seasons, which it has apparently displaced, and we're not resetting the seasonal number as we do with every other seasonal disease.  If this had been just another H?N? without any death overcounting, it wouldn't be able to make any news at all.  My assumption is also that without the hype, we wouldn't be testing or diagnosing the causes of pneumonia for a large number of patients, so while we could estimate flu/cold-caused deaths, they were not as diligently tested or recorded.  Please correct me if I'm wrong here, but for normal terminal patients dying of pneumonia, how often do you run confirmatory labs to verify flu, cold, etc., prior to this year?  (I know most countries sequence a lot of flu to help with subsequent year's vaccine guesses, but I don't know where those samples are primarily drawn, and I'd imagine 20-40 would be a better statistically representative sample of circulating diseases from which to draw.)</p>

        <p>As a fairly obvious point about low quality studies in 2020, every single study that uses PCR as a proxy for "sick" is wrong.  Every study that uses mortality counts based on PCR as a diagnostic are wrong.  The (quite remarkable) PCR technology and its significant limitations are well understood, so any journal failing to call out this great oversight has failed its review.  It's trendy to overlook that, but scientifically bereft.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic covid cases are identified by the PCR test which, the way it's being misused and the way its results are being purposely misinterpreted, cannot tell you anything about virulence or infectiousness.  It simply detects the genetic presence of the virus in your nasal pharynx.  You could have had some contact with the virus months before and still test positive.  Fauci himself said that results derived from tests run at cT values greater than 34 are totally unreliable as they are picking up dead nucleotides that tell you nothing about an active infection.</p>
<p>Additionally, both Fauci and the WHO stated last year that asymptomatic spread is never the driver of diseases in the history of all pandemics and that asymptomatic transmission of covid was very rare.  And there has been no conclusive evidence to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>So what you're really dealing with are two compounding issues that make what the OP is saying and what many people who are tired of regarding themselves and their fellow human beings as being in a permanently silent infectious state valid.</p>

        <p>The 2 basic pillars of germ theory are that pathogens exist and that those pathogens can cause you to get an infectious disease.  Since according to you there's a history of non-infectious diseases incorrectly classified as infectious, you must be implying that we are dealing with a disease that is not infectious. Or are you saying it literally doesn't exist and everyone is just magically falling ill following a chain of transmission even though when we can literally see it and test for it. </p>
<p>Whichever it is I hope your replacement theory is better and can withstand the insane lobbying powers of BIG GERM.</p>

<p>I never said that.</p>
<p>&rt; Or are you saying it literally doesn't exist and everyone is just magically falling ill following a chain of transmission even though when we can literally see it and test for it. </p>
<p>I am not saying that. Try reading what I actually typed to figure out what I said, it's much simpler and less open to interpretation that way.</p>
<p>There are experts in the field who believe some or all of what we are seeing can be explained by looking outside the germ theory paradigm. I have not done enough research into the topic to rule out the possibility they are right, despite it going against the current consensus.</p>

        <p>I'm sure you'd love it if I just took your ambiguous bs at face value when you fail to even say the name of your random woo-woo theory, let alone explain how germ theory is incorrect.  All while vaguely mentioning "experts". </p>
<p>I guess I'll repeat it in a more child friendly way. germ theory says tiny things that can be seen, go into your body and cause illnesses. What we are seeing is a virus, which is a tiny thing we have pictures of, go into the body and can cause ppl to fall ill. I would ask you to explain where the fault is and for your alternative but I won't hold my breath considering the fact that I already did ask and you just said vague shit like "there are some experts in the field" who are "looking outside the germ theory paradigm" whatever the fuck that means.</p>

        <p>You bring up the problem of verifying the studies of new medical treatment which is a combination of a number of factors ranging from no shared databases to failed studies not being published. You bring this up to counter bedrock scientific principles and findings which have been replicated, peer reviewed and applied to further advance their fields? And the way you try to prove that "real science isn't settled" is with a theory that was held literally before science, aka the scientific method, existed. got it</p>

        <p>Well, the reasoning was that it was thought that SARS-CoV-2 could be spread with very very weak symptoms and if someone in one of those 'risk groups' got it... they were screwed.</p>
<p>Now we know that asymptomatic spread is near non-existent.</p>

        <p>&rt; Because the idea of carrying the virus around and spreading it while having absolutely no symptoms of any kind just doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>In all the "Death Toll" clocks, you'll notice there is no difference between an "Asymptomatic Death" and a "Symptomatic Death".</p>
<p>How do you have a "Asymptomatic Death" if there are no symptoms to die from?</p>
<p>Well, you can't. That is why they always have 2 or more other things that killed them.</p>

&rt;Over 85% of COVID-19 Infections in China Went Undetected Early On
&rt;— Number of mild or asymptomatic infections emphasizes need for mitigation measures</p>
<p>So if 85% of people who test positive are asymptomatic... then around the same percentage of "Deaths" are ""Asymptomatic Deaths"... meaning they had no symptoms to die from.</p>

        <p><code>I wonder. Do other viruses just sit in the body before doing damage? Because the idea of carrying the virus around and spreading it while having absolutely no symptoms of any kind just doesn't make sense to me.</code> 
As an answer to your question, yes. It is called the “incubation period.”</p>
<p>During the incubation period, viral genomes are replicating and the host cells are responding to fight it. The host produces cytokines such as interferon that can have global effects, leading to the classical symptoms of an infection. These symptoms are known as the “prodrome”, to distinguish them from those characteristics of infection. </p>
<p>Not all viruses transmit during the incubation period. Ebola, for instance, does not. But, many do, such as COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization, <code>The incubation period for COVID-19, which is the time between exposure to the virus (becoming infected) and symptom onset, is on average 5-6 days, however can be up to 14 days. During this period, also known as the “pre- symptomatic” period, some infected persons can be contagious Therefore, transmission from a pre-symptomatic case can occur before symptom onset.</code></p>

        <p>I don't believe asymptomatic transmission has even been proven.  It is still an (unproven) theory, yet people get away with treating it as if it is fact.  The burden of proof should be on those advocating for the theory.</p>

        <p>Same with the people claiming the vaccine doesn’t prevent transmission. It does with every other vaccine we’ve made with 99+% efficiency but suddenly this one doesn’t? Just because there MIGHT be a possibility and it hasn’t been proven vaccinated people still have to wear the mask? Jumping through all these hoops is pointless they’ll never accept that I’m healthy even with my vaccine so what was the point</p>

        <p>2 positive PCR tests with a rather low CT for starters.<br>
also the fact that it perfectly aligns with the estimated incubation period.</p>
<p>when we visited. the person had absolutely no symptoms whatsoever.</p>
<p>I think you people misunderstand the point of this.<br>
while I believe that asymptomatic spread is real (since I experiences something that has little to no other explanation), I also don't think its a sane reason to force people to lock themselves in.<br>
its insanity. absolute insanity.<br>
wether or not it is possible to spread asymptomatically does not even come into this.</p>

        <p>There are further questions to ask-- it sounds like you were maybe traveling to visit this person? Or even if not, hiw restricted were your contacts during this period? I think the timing on these things is quite flexible so I'm not sure you can say "aligns perfectly" but rather only "aligns well". There should be a relatively wide window in which you have to exclude the possibility that you were maybe exposed to a symptomatic person out in public (in the store or while traveling).</p>
<p>You say "little to no other explanation", so maybe you have strong answers to all this.</p>
<p>&rt;its insanity. absolute insanity.

<p>Nice, yeah. Sorry about the downvotes and hopefully you continue to share your experiences and information here. I am in this sub partly just for sanity but also to learn about real cases and experiences, since I had been tuning out all Corona BS for almost 4 months, because it is literally all bullshit I would not care about (same as the flu, about which I do not give a shit), if it weren't for authoritarian fucks forcing me into the position where I have to try to I guess "debate" my way out of eternal lockdown. They are media-gaslit psychos and unwavering authoritarians though, so... only so much benefit to learning to debate the issues.</p>

        <p>my example is a pretty clear cut one I would say.<br>
this I going to be a bit lengthy.</p>
<p>my wife was a traced contact of a positive tested person. that person was completely asymptomatic when my wife visited. I did not visit myself.<br>
the only contacts I had during that time were people from the office.<br>
all of which got themselves tested after my positive result. none of which where positives aswell. I was the only one from the office who tested positive so chances that I contracted it there are very slim at best.<br>
I did not have contact with anyone else outside of my own household outside of that. wife, me, 2 kids. thats it.</p>
<p>the contact person lost her sense of smell 3 days after my wife visited. the first developed symptome. keep in mind that asymptomatic does not mean you never develop symptoms later on.  <br>
it was also the only symptom the other person developed. no runny nose. no cough or anything. nothing that would normally be considered to be contagious.</p>
<p>my wife lost her sense of smell and taste 5 days after that.<br>
I lost my sense of smell 3 days after my wife.<br>
one of the kids got higher temperature 7 days after that.<br>
the oldest kid was a little bit more sleepy then usual. noticable, but not problematique.</p>
<p>it would be very strange to the point of being bizarre if we did not contract COVID from someone who showed absolutely no visible symptoms at the only time one of us had contact with that person.</p>
<p>make of it what you will though, its a free world.<br>
for me theres no question anymore that asymptomatic spread exists.  </p>
<p>how I feel about it I already told. take care.</p>

        <p>we go grocery shopping once a week. which was 1 day before my wife visited her friend.<br>
after that I send my parents to do the shopping for me, just in case. wife was in quarantine at that point already.  <br>
2 days later we both got our positive results.</p>
<p>other people who got in contact with the person 1 day before my wife visited got COVID aswell.</p>

<p>It’s really genius. They have made people believe that when they don’t feel sick or have any symptoms, they’re not healthy, they’re actually spreading a “deadly virus” without even knowing it.</p>

        <p>I am sick, but there's so much bad shit I can die of my own body is doing to me, I am sick of the fear mongering.  You think I want to line up for some vaccine that will make things worse and complicate things for the doctors. Too many people take their health for granted and don't ask questions. I never trusted the asymptomatic crap [permanent asymptomatic not just incubating]...even from the start I thought that doesn't make any damn sense. I have never heard of any other disease doing that. How handy for the powers that be!</p>

        <p>The "asymptomatic" angle of convincing healthy people they were sick and thereby convincing people that everyone around them was a carrier, was the biggest fraud in all of this that justified universal masks and lockdowns. It's what allowed them to progress this to a worldwide fascist-communist takeover whereas a logical approach, just like any other infectious disease, would've basically been the occasional commercial or sign saying "stay home if you're sick" with no other disruption to our lives whatsoever.</p>

        <p>100% agree, this is exactly it. Once 'asymptomatic spread' was accepted, logic and reason went out the window. This is why I'm so disturbed people haven't even questioned the idea that a healthy person is a danger to everyone.</p>

        <p>That’s the funny thing when my family seems like they’re in shock when I say I won’t get the vaccine even if it’s available to me soon. I don’t need it. I haven’t been avoiding people. I’m pushing against mask mandates now, I haven’t worn one at work except for one day in 2020 and no one else has worn it either. I got my antibody test recently, nothing. I am healthy, I don’t have diabetes, I am not overweight. I’m sitting this one out. I wasn’t afraid of the swine flu and I’m not afraid of this.</p>

        <p>This dude clearly died from heart disease, not covid. FAKE NEWS!!</p>
<p>“Mr. Jones came down with the novel coronavirus in the fall and was hospitalized in October. But like other “Covid long-haulers,” as they came to be known, he never fully recovered. He ended up in an emergency room on Feb. 8 with shortness of breath. Then he was transferred to Stony Brook University Hospital for a heart procedure; the virus had damaged his heart. Soon he went into cardiac arrest and was put on life support.</p>
<p>He died on Feb. 26 at 40. Ms. Saland said the cause was a combination of Covid-19 and pneumonia.”</p>

        <p>I've had two bosses with Covid twice at my workplace last year. They kept it secretive from everyone. First time, no one knew what it was, just a flu or something. Second time, no one had a clue who had it, but we suspected. Should I sue them for being around us spreading covid? No one got ill, but some of us felt more tired than usual. Mind you, most workers are over 55yrs old... 🤷🏻‍♀️
And guess what?!? They are fucking buying the government guidelines... And they were spreading covid around us 🤣🤣 I just want to laugh... Ridiculous</p>

        <p>I get that we don't know if someone has the virus unless they've been tested negative, but asymptomatic means or at least used to mean people who have the virus, but don't display any symptoms and can handle having the virus very well. It's concerning that some people are flat-out calling everyone with no symptoms asymptomatic. No! Only positive tested people can be asymptomatic, unless people want to be treated like covid patients. Hopefully, not a long of people use this terminology that way.</p>

        <p>Wanting to see something terrifying?  The more you look into the origins of vaccines the more disgusting and terrifying it gets.  (The 1918 Spanish Flu may not have been a flu at all, but vaccine injury and bacterial pneumonia, but that's another can of worms.  Back then, influenza was more of a catch-all term that meant they didn't know what it is.)</p>
<p>Dr. Stanley "Human-in-Form" Plotkin, re: experiments on orphans/mentally retarded/prisoners
https://youtu.be/yevV_slu7Dw</p>
<p>Published on Nov 5, 2018</p>
<p>Dr. Stanley Plotkin, January 2018. </p>
<p><strong>ATTY: Have you ever used orphans to study an experimental vaccine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.</strong></p>
<p>ATTY: Have you ever used the mentally handicapped to study an experimental vaccine? </p>
<p>DR. PLOTKIN: I don't recollect ever doing studies in mentally handicapped individuals. At the time in the 1960s, it was not an uncommon practice. </p>
<p><strong>ATTY: So you're saying -- I'm not clear on your answer. I'm sorry. Have you ever used mentally handicapped to study an experimental vaccine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DR. PLOTKIN: What I'm saying is I don't recall specifically having done that, but that in the 1960s, it was not unusual to do that. And I wouldn't deny that I may have done so.</strong></p>
<p>ATTY: Well, there's an article entitled “Attenuation of RA 27/3 Rubella Virus in WI38 Human Diploid Cells.” Are you familiar with that article? </p>
<p>DR. PLOTKIN: Yes. </p>
<p><strong>ATTY: In that article, one of the things it says is 13 seronegative mentally retarded children were given RA 27/3 vaccine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DR. PLOTKIN: Okay. Well, then that's, in that case that's what I did.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ATTY: Have you ever expressed that it's better to perform experiments on those less likely to be able to contribute to society, such as children with handicap, than with children without or adults without handicaps?</strong></p>
<p>DR. PLOTKIN: I don't remember specifically, but it's possible. </p>
<p>ATTY: Do you remember ever writing to the editor of "Ethics on Human Experimentation"? </p>
<p>DR. PLOTKIN: I don't remember specifically, but I may well have. </p>
<p>ATTY: I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Exhibit 43. Do you recognize this letter you wrote to the editor? </p>
<p>DR. PLOTKIN: Yes. </p>
<p>ATTY: Did you write this letter? </p>
<p>DR. PLOTKIN: Yes. </p>
<p><strong>ATTY: Is one of the things you wrote: “The question is whether we are to have experiments performed on fully functioning adults and on children who are potentially contributors to society or to perform initial studies in children and adults who are human in form but not in social potential?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ATTY: Have you ever used babies of mothers in prison to study an experimental vaccine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ATTY: Have you ever used individuals under colonial rule to study an experimental vaccine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DR. PLOTKIN: Yes.</strong></p>

        <p>but why NO VACCINE like i kinda get it that you mean that you shouldn’t wear a mask since you are healthy (even do you mostly get a mask to not get sick) the vaccine part is kinda just odd. Like why wouldn’t you want to never get the vaccine, a vaccine that would stop this «newnormal» it seems prettys stupid actully</p>

        <p>Mostly because it is experimental and not a vaccine. It is gene therapy that has never successfully been used on humans. Plus the statistics just don’t add up.</p>

        <p>That was me at the end of January. When I realized I had it, I stayed home. Family members brought me food. Then it was over. I went back to work and my normal activities.</p>
<p>So now, once again, (to borrow this post's title) "I'm not sick. I'm not symptomatic. I'm not asymptomatic. I'm not staying home. I don't need a mask. I don't need a vaccine."</p>

        <p>I’m happy for you, lots of us aren’t that lucky and I hope down the line you don’t enjoy the myriad of delayed effects this disease can bring to the healthiest of individuals. As for me, I’ll keep wearing a mask and thinking about my loved ones who continue to go in and out of the hospital. Even if in the future we find out masks weren’t enough to do shit, at least I’ll know I wasn’t so self righteous to not inconvenience myself for the chance to help others.</p>

        <p>I know how you feel. The flu messed me up badly in 2009; it was the sickest I've ever been in my life. Took years to get a cold to not hang on for weeks. That was the first time I'd experienced post-viral syndrome, and here's hoping it's the last.</p>

        <p>It blows my mind how many people don’t know that post viral syndrome has always been around, and it is no where near exclusive to covid. It’s certainly no argument for fearing this virus more than a flu virus.</p>

        <p>Community only functions when we all work together. Modern philosophy has fucked people over with the idea of individualism. 
You are in a giant community, and without that community you would have absolutely nothing. No electricity, no clothes, no food, no water. All these things you take for granted are provided to you by someone with skills you’ve never had. Because we rely so heavily on this community to sustain our ways of life, we have to cooperate with this community. A mask might have a 1% chance of reducing risk of death, and you might think that’s useless, but the community is wearing masks because we have agreed that 1% is better than 0%. 
You can chose not to wear a mask, but you also have to accept that you’re rejecting the community when you do that, and the community is more than allowed to reject you too.</p>

        <p>You do realize that this virus spread around the entire planet hitting every single state and country around the world in 3 weeks, right?  Unless you stayed locked away in your home without any deliveries for an entire year, you've been exposed.  And if you did stay locked inside your home with no deliveries for an entire year, you'd be dead.</p>

        <p>You weren't "conditioned", a doctor explained to you that asymptomatic transmission is common. That's not conditioning, it's education.
You've been conditioned to think this deadly virus isn't a big deal by your media, but I guess they know more than doctors, right. 550k dead americans SO FAR. That's almost 2 WW2s!! It's a 9/11 DAILY. But yeah, you're worried about being "conditioned"....... And doing what you want.... Selfish ignorance.</p>

        <p>Many people feel the same way as you, that's why we're experiencing a pandemic that's still killing about 7000 people a day. You don't want to live in fear, fine. But don't act like you're not doing it entirely out of selfishness. If putting on a mask is too much for you, well then this obviously has absolutely nothing to do with the virus and everything to do with your insecuritites. Sorry that your parents failed to teach you that you're not the center of the world, and that other people exist.</p>

        <p>I want this shit to stop for the kids and others. not myself.<br>
don't give me that selfishness bullshit. </p>
<p>anytime I hear of or see healthy kids that have or had to lock themselves in because they came into contact with a COVID positive person it breaks my fucking heart.</p>
<p>these kids are supposed to have the same great experiences I was allowed to have when I was young.  </p>
<p>people who support lockdowns and quarantines for the healthy are denying them this.</p>
<p>it is you who is selfish<br>
it is you who is inconsiderate <br>
it is you who denies science</p>
<p>this desease is mostly only a risk to people who could easily isolate themselves from society. 
retired people for crying out loud.<br>
why must everyone else be locked up for them?<br>
they get locked away either way so why not at least let the rest carry on living. 
especially for the childrens sake.</p>

<p>People like you never seem to mention the "Government" and "Scientists" labeling human beings "Essential" and "Non-Essential" and tossing the "Non-Essential" group into poverty.</p>
<p>Why do you think you ignore that part?</p>
<p>Or all the poor hypochondriacs that are now full blown agoraphobics? Or all the hypochondriacs created?</p>

        <p>I don't. I never claimed I did. I am lucky enough to be given a lateral flow test every day I'm at work before I start and a PCR test every week but I don't have a lot of confidence in the reliability of the lateral flow tests as many co-workers have produced negative results while carrying (and suffering) from the virus. The "crux" of the issue is that we are being currently asked to live our lives as if we have the virus even if we don't. This makes sense to me until the vaccines have been fully rolled out. I see enough people die in my job and it's never pleasant. I was one of the first few people in the world to receive the Pfizer vaccine. I would rather be part of the solution than part of the problem. Denial is not a solution.</p>

        <p>I appreciate that.  I personally believe the PCR test is horseshit as well for identifying an asymptomatic carrier because, as you can see from one of the videos of Ontario's doctors talking about in my post history, it's so sensitive it can detect the mere genetic presence of viral RNA material in one's nasal pharynx that is very likely not significant in terms of virulence.  I believe that they way the test is being misused is precisely to lead people to the inescapable solution of getting the vaccine.  It has been a tool to generate hysteria and panic.  I also don't believe the vaccine will be a solution either, because they will end up telling us that we have to get a new shot every 6 months with perhaps boosters in between indefinitely.</p>

        <p>Statistically I’ve no idea but it’s likely to be low at the moment because here in the UK most businesses are closed and mask wearing is mandatory for those that are open. I also have to wear a mask while at work and be tested daily because I care for the elderly suffering with dementia. I also have had the Pfizer vaccine and was one of the first few people in the world to do so. I don’t know what your question has to do with my question though.</p>

        <p>Well you said "How do you know you are not asymptomatic?" when talking about masks.</p>
<p>And so .. right now if I had to place a bet I would say I'm <em>not</em> asymptomatic.   Because it has been a year so far and I havent gotten infected yet.  And I havent really changed anything that I do. </p>
<p>So every other day of the past 365 days I was not infectious.  I'm probably not infectious today as well.</p>
<p><em>Could</em> I have the virus?  I guess there is a small chance that today, out of all the days, I do have the virus.</p>
<p>But I'm feeling healthy. Not sneezing or coughing. Not sharing any small enclosed areas with strangers, and I'm not around any vulnerable people.</p>
<p>So this idea that "Anybody could be infectious" ..?   I dunno. Sure.  <em>But what are the chances that any particular person is infectious at this moment</em>?  It's actually very low.  1 in 1000?   </p>
<p>Anyone can be a murderer too.  But we dont act like everybody is a potential murderer.</p>

        <p>Well because there’s a large percentage of people infected who are not experiencing any symptoms (that means you could have the virus but are not aware). You should already know this, but you said “every other day of the past 365 days I was not infectious” yet you have no way of knowing this. Studies have shown that asymptomatic patients had as large of a viral load in their noses, throats, and lungs as patients who were infected with the coronavirus and developed symptoms. This is also obvious by how far and how quickly the virus initially spread. But for some reason everyone who follows this sub likes to ignore that fact.</p>

<p>Nobody near me got sick.  </p>
<p>So you can keep making up reasons why "anybody can have it!" but I could make the same argument about cancer.</p>
<p>Do you have cancer right now?</p>
<p>I mean ... how do you <em>know</em>?</p>
<p>&rt;Studies have shown that asymptomatic patients had as large of a viral load in their noses, throats, and lungs as patients who were infected with the coronavirus and developed symptoms.</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that (at least here in Canada) only 1 person in 37 has had the virus.</p>
<p>Lets even ridiculously over-estimate that and say "1 person in 10".</p>
<p>So my odds are <em>still</em> 90% that I have not had the virus.</p>
<p>Good odds, right?</p>
<p>If you want to narrow that down to "Am I currently infectious" my odds are even better.</p>
<p>So lets say that I <em>am</em> actually in that very very very small sliver of people in Canada who are presently infectious.</p>
<p>Now what are the chances that I actually give that infection to somebody?</p>
<p>Well considering that <em>even if sombody lives with me</em> they only have a 20% chance of getting sick as well, I would say that my chances of giving it to some random person that I pass by on the street or stand next to in a line are very slim.</p>
<p>Ok .. so lets say I <em>do</em> give it to someone I am standing next to in a line up.  Are they under 60?  If so .. they are going to be fine.  Overall, there is a 99.9% chance that they will be fine.</p>
<p>But .. the virus currently has a "Reproduction number" of over 1.0.  It's something like 1.2 (or it was, when cases were still spreading).</p>
<p>So that person that <em>i</em> gave the virus to (who has a 99.9% of being fine) might give the virus to 1.2 other people.  Let's round that up to "2".</p>
<p>Ok ... so who are those 2 people?  Are they under 60?  If so ... they are going to be fine.</p>
<p>So let's say that my little virus (that I didnt <em>start</em> remember, I got it from someone.) eventually, after 10 "steps" and 10 <em>other</em> people "passing it forward", ends up at a 75 year old guy.</p>
<p>Well .. now it kind of depends on how healthy he is.  Because 1 in 5, or 20%, of 70somethings will need to be hospitalized if they get covid.  80% of 70somethings <em>wont</em> get it bad enough to go to hospital.</p>
<p>And 5%, or "1 in 20", 70somethings are fragile enough that they might not survive a bad viral infection like Covid.</p>
<p>But .. I must ask .. why is the person who gave the virus to the old dude not in a mask? <em>Those</em> are the people who should be wearing masks.  And if they <em>were</em> wearing masks, then how did the old dude get sick?</p>

        <p>But I didn’t say “I don’t have cancer”. </p>
<p>The problem with all of your “statistics” and your “odds” is that it’s all based on the number of people being tested (which you haven’t) and during a time where there have been lockdown and/or adequate measures put in place. I don’t know much about what they’ve been doing in Canada to combat the virus but I’m assuming it’s similar to changes made here in the UK. So all of your argument is based on measures being put in place. All you have said is basically that whatever Canada are doing it’s working. </p>
<p>Life isn’t as simple as numbers and odds though. Here in the UK the spread within hospitals has become so rife that our health system has been at breaking point with staff off sick and hospitals at capacity and anyone visiting hospital with any other condition having a massive chance of catching the virus, for example. </p>
<p>You only seem to be concerned about YOURself and how all of this affects YOU. This isn’t about you.</p>

        <p>&rt; Life isn’t as simple as numbers and odds though.</p>
<p>When you are talking about "What are the chances that I have had coronavirus" it really is numbers and odds.</p>
<p>&rt;Here in the UK the spread within hospitals has become so rife that our health system has been at breaking point </p>
<p>But every single place in the world had said that they were at the "breaking point" almost every other week over the past year.  </p>
<p>But no place actually ever reached that point.  "Luckily".  We had dozens of stories of ".. just about to happen!" but no stories of ".. it happened!"</p>
<p>&rt;and hospitals at capacity and anyone visiting hospital with any other condition having a massive chance of catching the virus, for example</p>
<p>It's weird that it sounds like such an emergency when you talk about it.</p>
<p>But when I look at <a href="https://imgur.com/a/LxTZdty">UK cases</a>, I see that any kind of emergency is finished.  Cases have dropped to about 1/10th of what they were over winter virus season.</p>
<p>And when I look at <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oOTTVUv">UK deaths</a> .. again .. things look great.  They are about 1/5th of what they were in the first wave.</p>
<p>So things look really really good in the UK right now, yes?</p>
<p>&rt;You only seem to be concerned about YOURself and how all of this affects YOU. This isn’t about you.</p>
<p>No. And I realize this is kind of a typical thing that you guys learn to repeat, but I'm actually concerned about all the seniors who are not sick, but who have been killed by a year of isolation, depression, and stolen family time.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t talking about chances, you were. You claimed you have never caught the virus but I pointed out that without either regular swab tests or an antibody blood test there’s no way you can say that. </p>
<p>UK cases have been at a steady average of around a thousand deaths per day throughout the winter. Things are starting to improve. That’s because the government enforced another lockdown and a rapid rollout of vaccines. </p>
<p>When I talk about hospitals at breaking point I know what I’m talking about. I work in healthcare. I have friends and family who work in my local hospital and I regularly speak to district nurses in my job. The hospitals “never actually reach breaking point” because they start turning patients away and cancelling or postponing treatment to make way for people who can’t breathe by themselves. </p>
<p>I’m concerned for seniors who aren’t sick too. I work in a care home and I’ve seen the affect lockdown has had on them. Denying the problem isn’t going to move anything forward though. The way forward is vaccination.</p>

        <p>Well immunosenescence is the deterioration of our immune system as we get older. This includes immunity from vaccination. So while a vaccine may be as high as 90% effective for you and me, for the elderly it’s much lower. So saying “older folk are vaccinated at this point” shows your lack of understanding on how we actually use vaccines to combat an infectious disease. It’s more important for younger people to have the vaccine to avoid spreading the virus to the elderly. That’s why I had my vaccine before the elderly people I care for had theirs. Being asymptomatic does not make any difference. Studies have shown that asymptomatic patients had as large of a viral load in their noses, throats, and lungs as patients who were infected with the coronavirus and developed symptoms. However, the vaccine builds immunity for those even without symptoms which helps them fight off the virus quicker (even if they don’t know they have it) and thus lowers the chances of transmission.

        <p>The efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine is about 96%. About the same between my age group and those above ages 65 and above. For Moderna there is a 10% difference in the efficacy between those 65+ and those younger than 65. So the chances of catching covid are very low after getting either vaccine, regardless of age. Contracting covid was never really a concern for me. It was the likelihood of the elderly dying if positive. </p>
<p>I wonder if those 65+, who got a vaccine and contracted covid experienced less severe covid related symptoms. If this is true, the risk of dying after the vaccine, even if they contracted covid, might be lower. Do you have any studies on this? I can't find any.</p>
