    <strong>The Proof From The CDC Death Data, This Is A Massive Hoax!</strong>

<p>From Feb 1 to March 28 everything is more or less fine, the lockdown hoax gets activated by the global deep state everywhere in the world, then deaths involving covid go in overdrive... Keep in mind 90 % of positives tests are false with no symptoms, so if you died of pneumonia, a respiratory illness, and are " presumed " to have died with covid, it counts as a covid death in their books.</p>
<p>From April 4th to mid May, deaths of pneumonia and influenza with presumed covid skyrocket, so do the covid deaths. Then as June hits, deaths from pneumonia and influenza are on par with deaths with presumed covid.</p>
<p>It seems by their own admission, any increase or decrease of deaths is directly linked with other respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and the flu. The total weekly deaths in the US correlate exactly with any increase or decrease in pneumonia and flu deaths. A certain amount of people die on the regular basis of cancer, old age, accidents, etc. Hospitals just weasel in covid on death certificates for the mulah, they count presumed with covid as a covid death... </p>
<p>Now deaths by state is comedy, practically every state has more pneumonia deaths then presumed covid deaths, except New York City which is in the category along the states. New York lists total 56k deaths for the year as of August 31st, 20,622 with presumed covid. Look at Oregon, Texas, Pennsylvania and other states to see how absurd New York City claim is.</p>
<p>If this isn't hospital fraud to leech money from the government, I don't know what is... 37 % of deaths in New York City are covid this year, if you look at other states, it's a fraction of the total deaths. Something clearly doesn't add up with NY numbers</p></p>
