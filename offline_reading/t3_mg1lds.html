    <strong>Should we enjoy the decline?</strong>
    <p><p>You can form a small community around yourself to preserve sanity. People that think the same way you do, and by this I mean those who won't crucify you if you say COVID 19 is over blown and nonsensical in most of their preventative practices... You can avoid television that is constantly rubbing some type of agenda in your face... and you may even move to a state that is more relaxed.</p>
<p><em>But</em> ...... you will most likely be a minority.</p>
<p>Yeah, some normies may be waking up but not to the point of rebellion. Some people are now outspoken about how tired they are of masks yet they'll never not wear until it's allowed. People may dislike the vaccine but will they ever realize how nefarious it is in nature?</p>
<p>The reason why I bring this up is because I was looking at the instagram page called  Timecapsule that posts photos from the 90's. Candid ones of people in department stores, videos of adverts at the time, clips of forgotten / popular television shows and movies... And instead of getting upset, I just accept that things are only going to get worse.</p>
<p>Not capitulation. Not throwing in the towel. Acceptance that considering we are the minority, the movement is much bigger than us. Save yourself but society is in a downward spiral.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>I wouldn't cash your chips just yet. The only minority we're in is the one which is outspoken. Nearly every person I've spoken (here in the UK) to in person is "over it", hates masks, etc. and hold a heavy disapproval of our government. My city is super busy, maybe a 5% mask rate outside. </p>
<p>Remember that reedit and twitter are quite literally extremist left hellhole echo chambers full of hateful, virtue signalling rhetoric, but they are also a very, very vocal minority in themselves. Attitudes on twitter and such rarely reflect real life. I recommend finding the quiet majority and try to encourage then to speak up. That's the  way through this- real people forming real alliances in real life, not on these toxic technocratic platforms that are designed to encourage and take advantage of our worst behaviours.</p>
<p>Then again, all that said, I'm fucking terrified and don't see a way out of this vaccine passport oppression regime because right now there's not enough speaking up and too many "just going along with it" to try and get back to normal.</p>

        <p>That sounds like it comes from a live and let live person.  The doomers are the opposite of that.</p>
<p>It's not even really about public health in many cases, but control.  They wouldn't let you be and they'd hound you until you bow to their statism.</p>
<p>Only way out is to get enough people over the fear and consistently outnumber doomers with people from the middle ground.</p>
