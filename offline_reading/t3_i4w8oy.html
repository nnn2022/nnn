        <p>I’m a teacher and I’m utterly disgusted by my peers who are actively fighting against us going back. I have not seen massive deaths like they claim and I have no fear returning to work. This has become overblown and the majority do not want to go back for the simple fact they have become lazy being home.
I’ve asked why it’s ok for daycares to be open and the response I get is “daycares can only accept 10 kids!!”, “we are NOT childcare workers” (which we are, that’s a simple fact we cannot deny), and “we can’t properly socially distance because kids are super spreaders” 
I asked what do they expect working families to do? Quit their jobs and monitor their child’s virtual learning? So what happens when families can’t afford their rent or mortgage, utilities, and groceries? They should become homeless and hungry? Of course they have no answers for this. 
The research I’ve seen shows the vast majority of people will be fine and survive this with no problem, children are unaffected, and overall the majority of people will be fine. 
If schools start the year virtual, we will never return to the classroom. They will not send us back in the fall during the flu season and it will always be unsafe. 
I have lost hope that we will ever see pre-pandemic normalcy. I fear that there will be MASSIVE staff reductions in public schools because if it’s virtual, class size will not be a concern anymore... especially with asynchronous learning that can be completed anytime. 
I’ve also seen peers creating ads for in person tutoring, of course us being paid with our regular salary and tax free tutoring money, several people will be making a killing. 
I’ve seriously considered looking at going to a private school that offers in person learning for the 21-22 school. It might be worth going to daycare and teaching private preschool. I have a passion for early childhood education and my peers are actively fighting for us to teach through a computer. It will never be safe enough for them again.</p>

        <p>The government cannot assess the efficacy of virtual learning because, of course, in-person examinations are too dangerous! The fact that large numbers of kids don't have their own computer or are simply not showing up to class is apparently an insufficient concern :/</p>

        <p>Only 1 child out of 53 actually submitted her virtual work everyday. Several children have families who don’t speak or read English... they cannot complete the work and primary aged children are not super efficient with technology. I’m almost 24 and I struggle with creating the online lessons I’ll be required to do.</p>

        <p>Online learning is completely unsuitable for elementary school. I'm not thrilled about it even for middle or high school, but at least high school students can read and follow instructions on their own and they have enough mental skills to navigate whatever help features there are if they run into problems. Kids who aren't really literate yet probably aren't skilled enough with computers to use them well either.</p>

        <p>&rt; I fear that there will be MASSIVE staff reductions in public schools because if it’s virtual, class size will not be a concern anymore... especially with asynchronous learning that can be completed anytime.</p>
<p>I imagine that most teachers have never considered this, that the only reason that they were all working in the spring because it was a continuation and completion of already-established classes.  By begging not to go back to school in the fall, they are quickly making themselves obsolete and putting their own jobs at risk, for exactly the reasons that you articulated.  Who cares about student-to-teacher ratios when everyone's online, and the lessons can be prerecorded?  One instructor could present the courses for an entire school district, and depending on the subject, some lessons could be reused year after year.  And if you're not having school at school, you also eliminate or sharply reduce the need for custodians, cafeteria workers, bus drivers, and other support positions.  Whether people like it or not, schools are as much a part of the economy as any other business, and changes tend to have a ripple effect through other sectors.</p>
<p>One would really think that working people would not support measures that could lead to their jobs' being declared redundant or obsolete, and thus permanently putting them out of work.  I work in public transportation, and I am always careful not to advocate for any position that will cause people not to go out and ride public transportation.  After all, it's bad for my own bottom line if I lose my job because people aren't riding.  That's like when someone discusses teleportation, and I'll be the first to say that teleportation is bad for business, if it means that people don't need to get on trains and buses to get where they're going.</p>

        <p>When I brought this up to my friends that they could lay us off, they were worried. It hasn’t crossed their mind. I talked to my dad tonight and he suggested that I update my resume and look into different fields in the event that I am not given a contract for the 2021-2022 school year. My district announced today that we will start the first nine weeks virtual, hoping for 2 day weeks the second quarter. Our second quarter begins in November... they will NOT bring us back during flu season and my coworkers said I’m being ridiculous when I said we will not be in schools at all this year. I think we will be lucky to return in the spring, I fear we are witnessing the dismantling of public education. 
Why hire 2-4 teachers per grade level when the number can be slashed by hiring one teacher for each grade level? I hope that I’m wrong and I want to teach in person but I fear that will never happen again.</p>

        <p>Too many people don't realize that the longer this goes on, the more lasting the effects may end up being, as people shift their habits and adjust.  We want this to just be an aberration.  The longer it continues, the more it becomes a "new normal".</p>

        <p>They don’t care, when I question why they don’t want to go to work and I state I want to go back I’ve been told I’m lying and not really a teacher. If I was really a teacher, I wouldn’t want to go back to work. The groupthink is strong. My latest response is that I am a teacher and some of us want to go back to work. The fact that elementary teachers are deluding themselves into thinking virtual learning is a solid replacement for in person is disgusting.</p>

        <p>Cowards. I sometimes work with COVID patients. I've had to operate on COVID positive patients and round on them in the hospital. If I can do that without cowering in fear and bitching about it, they can do their jobs too.</p>

        <p>Any teacher who doesn't go into a classroom should not get paid. Simple as that. </p>
<p>Online teachers make next to nothing for their content - if these teachers wanna do education online, they can start making what online teachers make instead.</p>

        <p>I’m so glad my kids school is having in person classes (and an online option). I wish they didn’t have the stupid security theater. But it could be worse. 
Now I’m just hoping that stay open all year.</p>
