    <strong>Save the High Street</strong>
    <p><p>The government doesn't care if the high steet dies.
Many people are crying out against the lockdown and restrictions the government have placed on them, but the fact is if everyone does their part we can stand against it and succeed. For instance, shopping in smaller grocery stores, choosing small cafes to go to instead of the larger ones like Costa and Starbucks. I went into one today which is actually run by volunteers to help give less advantaged ones a better life. It is so sad to see the people who are out there trying to improve the lives of others are the ones suffering from the governments decision to lockdown. If we individually choose to support these small companies then they might just stand a chance against the giants taking over.</p></p>
