        <p>I think it's exactly what happened. Otherwise most people would not line up when they could have covid and take either of these generic drugs who do not harm anyone and have very good safety profiles for decades, during the pandemic. </p>
<p>Also, since it's generic they won't make a killing off of it, unlike the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Why is there such controversy over using drugs that have been used for decades and are proven safe for use. Ivermectin is widely being used in Asia and Africa to treat covid and is generally accepted as at least somewhat effective. In some cases its hailed as a miracle drug. Simply mentioning these drugs will get you banned on YouTube. Attacked on social media. The medical profession disowns it. </p>
<p>The irony of then advocating experimental, untested vaccines for use on healthy people. Its an insane situation.</p>

        <p>It might be worth mentioning that back in the 80s 4-5 times as much Federal money was spent on an AIDS vaccine as was spent on treatment.  Yet AZT was the first real breakthrough, there are now reasonable life-long treatements available and still no real vaccine. </p>
<p>This was all research directed by one A. Faucci.</p>

        <p>This is not a theory. This is fact. I heard RFK, Jr. Speak at our church two weeks ago and this one one of the first points he made. The MSM presstitutes had to reinforce the scientific fraud that Fauci, Inc. was propagating because if there existed a viable alternative to treat Covid then the vaccines would never have qualified under the EUA. But it’s just a conspiracy you guys come on, the pathogen delivery device they call a “vaccine” is safe, it won’t cause pathogenic priming and a subsequent cytokine storm leading to death when the new Covid variant rolls around.</p>
