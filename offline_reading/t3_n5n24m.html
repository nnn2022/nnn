    <strong>The things I did when I was terrified of Covid</strong>
    <p><p>Long post ahead, not sorry. </p>
<p>I was living in Mexico City when the lockdown started and it was apocalyptic. I was amazed at how  such a huge city became a ghost town overnight. Everything was closed including schools and kids were doing online classes only. The only people on the streets were food delivery workers or people in Hazmat suits spraying god-knows-what all over the sidewalks. I remember that there were helicopters flying around all day and a car would drive down the streets with a megaphone alerting everyone to stay home and avoid contact with anyone in the most Doomsday way possible. It was terrifying and surreal to look out my window and see empty streets or hear complete silence.
At that point I was still too stupid to realize that the virus wasn't deadly and thought that for once the MSM actually cared about people and governments were protecting us (lol)</p>
<p>Anyway here's a list of the things I did when I was terrified of the lItErAL GlObAl PAndEmiC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely locked myself up with my abusive ex for five months. Absolutely no going out (except once to Walmart) no visits from friends, no contact with anyone including neighbors, fully masking before opening the door even if no one was outside.</li>
<li>Have all food and supplies delivered no-contact and sanitize everything at the door before bringing it in.</li>
<li>Sanitized my shoes after walking 3 ft to pick up my deliveries and washing my hands every twenty minutes.</li>
<li>Truly felt scared of dying from Covid and believing I would be hooked up to a respirator if I did catch it. </li>
<li>After three months of not leaving the house at all and fighting with my ex all day every day my mental health was deteriorating and I decided to go to the supermarket since it was the only thing that was opened. If anything that one supermarket trip worsened my anxiety and I didn't leave the house for another two months afterwards.</li>
<li>Did my groceries in full armor, mask, face shield, gloves and sanitizing everything before putting it in my cart.</li>
<li>Stayed as far away as possible from anyone wearing a mask and even further away from anyone not wearing their mask properly. </li>
<li>Took responsibility for my health and followed the restrictions perfectly to protect myself. </li>
<li>Maintained a healthy weight, did at home workouts and watched what I ate to avoid lockdown weight gain even though I am from obese I still thought even a little extra weight would be deadly if I caught the virus.</li>
<li>Did drugs (clearly I didn't care about my health thaaaat much) but was always fully aware of the negative consequences and knew that it would be hypocritical to demand others protect my health after purposely putting harmful substances into my body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I didn't do when I was terrified of the lItErAL GlObAl PAndEmiC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it other people's responsibility to protect me or make it my responsibility to protect them.</li>
<li>Call out non masked individuals and try to force a mask on them. I simply stayed away. </li>
<li>Claimed to follow restrictions to protect others and virtue signal all over social media. I followed restrictions to protect myself not your grandma. </li>
<li>Accuse strangers of spreading the virus for not masking or otherwise breaking the restrictions. I knew that not everyone was scared and as long as I was keeping myself safe what everyone else did wasn't my problem.</li>
<li>Go full out vigilante and report my friends or family for meeting up.  If my friends were having gatherings I never made it my business or threw a tantrum. I simply stayed away from their events and them. </li>
<li>Go out unnecessarily and get angry that other people are also going out unnecessarily. Not once did I go out except to the supermarket that one time because I was actually scared of catching a virus that no leisurely activity was worth the risk.</li>
<li>Wish death on anyone who didn't follow the rules.   Not once did I see a mask-free individual and hope that they get COVID or hope their loved ones get COVID and die. Once again, I stayed away. If they didn't care why should I?</li>
<li>Believed "safety" was more important than basic human rights or free speech. If people were speaking out against lockdowns or mask mandates I just ignored them and moved on with my life. I chose not to pay attention to them at the time but didn't try to silence or censor their message.</li>
<li>Demand everyone get a covid test regardless of having no symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, I can admit I wasted 5 months of my life because I let fear take over my ability to think for myself. I was scared of a virus and I did everything in my power to avoid it and protect myself from it because I knew I could not expect anyone else to do it for me. I learned there are countless ways to keep myself safe and that was enough to not care that others weren't as scared as me. I didn't care about the "greater good" or "saving just one life" I cared about not getting sick and if that somehow saved a life at some point (I know it didn't) then great.</p>
<p>After this realization I now firmly believe and not just suspect that most pro-lockdown folk are not actually afraid of covid or care about saving lives at all, they love the New Normal because for the first time in their life the government has made staying home, sitting on the couch all day watching MSM while shoving donuts down your gullet and putting a piece of cloth over your face when going out acts of "heroism" that should be applauded. I guarantee if daily exercise and zero carb diets became government mandates we would have riots in every direction.</p></p>

        <p>I've been to Mexico City once. A beautiful, very big, and densely populated city!  Just goes to show once you are scared, very hard to unscare. Especially if you have MSM on all day like my grandparents. People be about #ProChoice but when your choice contradicts the narrative, they quick to chime in ðŸ˜‚</p>

        <p>It is very beautiful indeed and there's always something going on, I think part of the reason I got so scared was because I everyone was so serious about the lockdown and no one was breaking the rules (which is really weird for us Mexicans lol). 
Ugh #ProChoice is such a joke now.</p>

        <p>Shows how powerful propaganda, especially fear propaganda is. I think fear is the strongest emotion of any emotion we experience. So what was the information or realisation that made you go from brainwshed to red pilled?</p>

        <p>I think I brainwashed myself very early on because I started following all updates ever since the first news article about the "mystery Wuhan wet market virus" started going around, I also watched the leaked China videos of people dropping dead on the street and piles of bodies that were supposedly from the virus and then there was that one story about 21 million cellphone users disappearing in China and it was speculated that it was all the COVID deaths so by the time it became widespread on MSM I had already fearmongered myself and thought this was a real pandemic.
 I have never been one to go along with whatever is being pushed by the media and I like to investigate all possibilities before accepting anything as an absolute truth and when I saw no people dropping dead in the streets, no bodies piling up, no ambulances going by nonstop day and night, empty funeral homes and people dying after being put on respirators even though they were managing okay on their own I realized it was a lie. Then all the nonsense restrictions started coming out (masks in restaurants at all times unless at the table, or first being told not to mask and then told to double mask,   counting all deaths as covid deaths etc) I fully realized I was a fool. I also did not want to be associated with virtue signallers or doomers in any way so I just said fuck it.</p>

        <p>I flipflopped in March when administrative boundaries where more important than actual population densities. And then nothing happened, despite having dozens of nursing homes <em>completely</em> infected.<br>
Then in May everything reopened without masks. June came, mask mandate. Then I got scared more of the state and society than of any virus. 
And here we are...</p>
