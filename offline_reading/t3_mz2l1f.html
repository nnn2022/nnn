    <strong>Is there any point in living anymore?</strong>
    <p><p>The fact of knowing what is currently happening has ruined my life. A lot of people in this sub are saying it's not going to end. I see no point in living anymore, if the rest of my life is going to be like this. I know no one who knows of what's going on in real life. I feel like there's nothing I can do. People on this sub have been telling me to move to Florida, but it's kind of hard because I live in northern Europe, and I'm not even 18. I've been also told to get off this subreddit because it's causing me anxiety, but it doesn't help because I still know of what's happening. I'd honestly want to live not knowing about all this, because I can no longer enjoy life. </p>
<p>I'm sorry if there are grammar mistakes because english is not my first language, and if the text is a bit repeating.</p></p>

        <p>No, it's because a teenager has just stated they want to kill themselves and your immediate reaction is to tear down the argument of someone trying to tell them that there is still a reason to live. I don't care about your view point on the subject as a whole, the implication of what you just did makes you a far bigger piece of shit than you even THINK we are over here.</p>

        <p>Take heart from this:  https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/anger-among-met-police-ranks-23980302.  Coming to your country soon, perhaps?</p>
<p>Sure, the MSM refers to the people as thugs, but in reality, these are just people that want to live a normal life.  The police have been very heavy handed with enforcing illegal lockdowns, and harassing people for what was considered completely normal just a year ago.  I've lost a lot of respect for police, even here in the USA.  They are an enforcement arm of the State, after all.</p>
<p>The point is that when the people say they have had enough, no police force or army will stop them.  There are more of us than them.  </p>
<p>Don't give up.  Find like minded people, organize, and create the kind of pressure that these people did in the UK.  Eventually the politicians will cave, and give up their control measures that create the "illusion of safety."</p>

        <p>Many people thought the nazis were well on their way to taking over the world (and in a way, they were).  But good people prevailed and the nazis were defeated. 
Btw, this is in NO way calling for violence.  Just trying to make a point.</p>

        <p>You're not alone friend. Did you see the hundreds of thousands of people marching in London over the weekend? Same happened in Germany last summer. And the videos of all those famous German actors speaking out?</p>
<p>Be patient. </p>
<p>Things suck and we complain about it here but we do it so we're motivated enough to try to change it, not to despair.</p>
<p>Also, you are still young. As a teenager your hormones are raging and that can absolutely lead to depression - it did for me when I was your age. </p>
<p>All things come to pass - even this. </p>
<p>But you need to be here with your feet planted on the earth to see it through. To see those better days.</p>
<p>Things change so much throughout a lifetime. Some good, some terrible - but it is all a cycle. </p>
<p>I take solace in quotes like this one from Boethius:</p>
<p>&rt; <em>It's my belief that history is a wheel. "Inconsistency is my very essence" -says the wheel- "Rise up on my spokes if you like, but don't complain when you are cast back down into the depths. Good times pass away, but then so do the bad. Mutability is our tragedy, but it is also our hope. The worst of times, like the best, are always passing away".</em></p>

        <p>Theres still plenty of things to do and good times to be had. You have a duty to train and fight against evil in any way you can. Not everything is about our own personal happiness. Your fathers and forefathers fought plague, wars, and would literally run around in the forest mudering eachother so their families could have a better life. Dont let them down. Get hard, get tough, prepare to fight with honor, even if your fight is simply to have a decent life in the face of absolute evil. </p>
<p>Believe me, Ive thought those exact same thoughts hundreds of times, even today. We in the west have gotten so soft that we think if things arent disneyland perfect, we despair and think of quitting. Evil, suffering, and tyranny are not new. This is our war. Heroes are born out of crisis. This is our time. Make it worth it.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure if people on this sub “believe” in therapy but it can be useful. Therapy is not intended to fix you, it’s intended to help you think differently about your life and everything around your life. Technically you reaching out here on Reddit is a search for therapy. But going to a professional therapist would be more beneficial. The professional is trained and experienced and being paid by you to help you. If you’re under 18 then the first step is to talk to your parents who hopefully are understanding and empathetic about how feel about life right now.</p>

        <p>what we actually could do is to prepare a new structure how we wish to interact with each other on a political level </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>by witnessing the excessive abuse of emergency laws what happened all over the globe in many nation states since about a year now</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>one might try to think of a future political structure where the very people who are each others neighbours come together and discuss ... how are we going to support each other in this moment ... is there any need for additional community support helping the individual to sustain itself  </p>
<p>what I am suggesting here is a consequential decentralisation of all political decision powers to the only real level ... the local level ... the space where people live together, live beside each other day after day  </p>
<p>how could this happen ? how could we shift the political powers of the nation state and the regional state towards the local community, so that every village, every town, every city-district could create its very own law, rules made for and with the people being each others neighbours ...  </p>
<p>the most elegant and smooth way I see in the renewal of the states constitutions, along lines such as:  </p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>such a renewed constitution of both the regional and nation state constitution resulting in the local community being empowered to decide all matters in full autonomy</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>would open the possibility also towards the widening of the circle of all who live here and now having the exact same weighted political voting power ... so that all who live here and now as permanent residents, all children, youth and adults ... would be able to participate in the decision making</p>
<p>I envision a future where standing armies get dissolved, police forces become obsolete, courts/judges get replaced by the (full) assembly of all permanent residents, all children, youth and adults who live in the local community creating, maintaining and interpreting the law ... and prisons will be no more as the local circle of residents would want to offer everyone a possibility to integrate itself back again into society on a progressive personal individual sovereign choice foundation</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>one thing I believe would greatly help creating both an sustainable ecological and social fair path into the future ... would be if every one human being could have some decent access to the most basic necessities of life ...  </p>
<p>a place to sleep and some food, some fresh water to drink and clean oneself with, an oven to keep oneself warm in the winter  </p>
<p>I believe that 1000 square meters of fertile soil given to each human being as a free lease for lifetime, no taxes asked, no rent to be paid for it</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>would satisfy the most basic needs</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so that everyone could decide wether to build a house for oneself on this leased land, plant some vegan foodstuff, plant some hempstalks to burn them instead of trees in the winter</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>or wether one would like to join forces, cooperate with others in a family or intentional community setting  </p>
<p>I believe that it would greatly help the evolution of a human being if it would have at all times have the choice wether it wants to stay on ones own, be happy to talk with the carrots, onions, potatoes etc. growing in ones garden, dance with the butterflies around the house where one would at times do some fiddling around, improving this or that wall a bit ...  </p>
<p>or if one would rather choose to have some more societal inclusive action in ones life, participating in a shared work schedule where in a community setting some would do the gardening, others do the sewing of clothes and yet others would do the house buildings</p>

<p>1500 square feets are about 139 square meters</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2500 square feets = 232 square meters</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2000 to 3000 kilograms of wood pellets to heat a living space of 139 to 232 square meters</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>using an avarage living space of 50 square meter for person</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2500 kilograms  divided trough 4 human beings makes roughly 600 kilogram of pellets one person would need to heat for a whole winter</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>one acre of hemp can yield about 2500 kg of fibre to make into pellets</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>one acre is about 4046 square meters</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>it would roughly calculated need 1000 square meters of hemp planted to cover the heating needs of one human being</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so ... in switzerland ... if all 8.4 million human beings would want to heat their homes with hemp pellets ... it would need</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>8 400 000 people multiplied with 1000 square meters = </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>8 400 000 000 square meters</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the whole population of switzerland would require a space of 8400 square kilometers to </p>
<p>cover its heating needs with hemp plantations</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>all the space what is used in switzerland for agriculture today is about 10 000 square kilometers</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this would be like ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if all 8.4 million human beings in switzerland would want to never again use wood for heating or construction but instead use clay for building houses and use hemp for heating</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>all the one million hectares or about ten thousand million square meters would be enough to grow us enough fibres to be warm in the winter ... and</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we would be able to eat each of us</p>

<p>perhaps also i could find the amount of wood biomass what would be able to harvest from the 1,3 millions of hectares of forests in switzerland without felling trees</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the question here would be ... how much fallwood does a hectare of forest produce</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and ... how could it be possible to reduce the heating needs if one would wear a lot of clothes in the winter inside the house ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>after some quick searching i was not able to find any numbers on how much kilogram fallen branches and dead fallen or dead standing trees one could harvest from an hectare of forest ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but i guess that the 1.3 million hectares of forests in switzerland could provide about half of the wood needed to heat everyones home ... all without killing a single tree ... just collecting what nature has trown down to the floor</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so ... this gives me a whole new calculation to do...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the goal here would be to find a way... how the people who live now in switzerland ... could use the public financial reserves in form of the 55 percent of shares of the swiss national bank what are in possession of the 26 cantons and therefore are under control of all who are eglible to vote in these 26 cantons what together form the nation state switzerland ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the 55 percent shares of the swiss national bank in possession of the 26 cantons are worth about 300 billion swiss francs</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>all the land used for agriculture in switzerland has an approximate market value of 100 billion swiss francs</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so there would be some 200 billion left after buying all the land from the farmers and give to the more than 2000 local communities ... called ... einwohnergemeinden ... which then would give everyone of the 8.4 million inhabitants some 500 square meters of land to build a house on it from clay and hempstalks and recycling materials ... to grow ones own vegetables ... and no one would have to pay any taxes or do any kind of work for the community ... this 500 square meters for everyone would come as a lifelong free of cost lease with only the condition to not pollute the soil, the air and the water</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>200 billion swiss francs to buy as much as possible from the 1.3 million hectares of forests in switzerland</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>let us see if that would be possible...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>according to this graphic</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zueriwald.ch/files/8214/9139/8528/grafik_waldpreise.png">http://www.zueriwald.ch/files/8214/9139/8528/grafik_waldpreise.png</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the avarage price for one square meter of forest would be </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1.6 swiss francs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tagblatt.ch/ostschweiz/stgallen-gossau-rorschach/der-wald-hat-14-500-besitzer-ld.178406">https://www.tagblatt.ch/ostschweiz/stgallen-gossau-rorschach/der-wald-hat-14-500-besitzer-ld.178406</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Im Schnitt ist ein Quadratmeter Wald für zwei bis drei Franken zu haben.  Wobei die Bandbreite zwischen hochwertigem Wald oder etwa solchem an  steilen Lagen zwischen einem und fünf Franken pro Quadratmeter schwankt."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1.31 million hectares = 13 100 000 000 square meters</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>multiplied with an avarage price of 2 francs per square meters</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>= 26 200 000 000 swiss francs</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so its less than 30 billion swiss francs what would be required to buy all the forests from private people and give it towards the more than 2000 local communities which then could either allow everyone living here to freely use the forests for deadfall ... collect as much fallen branches and dead trees they would need for their heating needs</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>or divide the communally owned forests into plots for everyone to use individually</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>as a rough and momentary estimation i guess that</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the one million hectares of land what is used in switzerland</p>
<p>could be distributed to 10 million people each 1000 square meters</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>of which 50 to 100 square meters could be used to build a house/hut and a storage space for food and heating materials ... hempstalks, collected fallwood from the nearby forests</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>350 square meters for vegetable gardening</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>50 square meters for paths</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and 500 square meters for hemp cultivattion</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>as we are now 8.4 million human beings who live here in switzerland</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>such a plan or a concept would still allow</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to invite 1.6 million human beings from the 80 million refugees for example to come here and live with us together in switzerland, with each one receiving 1000 square meters of land for personal individual food, heating and shelter .. free of cost, free of taxes</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>not the 11.6 million i have previously calculated with ... but still ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>inviting 1.6 million human beings to come here and instantly receive the local citizenship of this or that local community ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>would still be a serious attempt of wanting to repare ... wanting to contribute reparations towards the feudal and colonial unfair doings what swiss people too have participated in during the last 500 years </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cooperaxion.ch/">https://www.cooperaxion.ch/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and all this 10 million human beings each receiving a free of cost, free of tax duties lifelong lease of 1000 square meters per person and free acess to the nearby forests to gather as much firewood they need from fallen branches and dead trees ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we could all live here without needing to import any food or kill any animals or kill any trees</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but how could we get there ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i believe in the circle of equals</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the full assembly of all children, youth and adults who live here and now in this neighbourhood, in this village, in this town, in this city-district ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>all who live here and now </p>
<p>everyone with the very same weighted voting power</p>
<p>one human being=one vote</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>gathering to create the rules and laws what are valid within the territory of this local sovereign community</p>

        <p>how then could the local community become its own sovereign</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>for example via a renewal of regional states and nation states constitutions </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>perhaps along such wordings as:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the local community is its own sovereign. it inherits all political powers from the regional/provincial/cantonal state and from the nation state.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes its own law. rules what the inhabitants of this local sovereign community create with and for each other. the local law replaces all laws previously made on regional/provincial/cantonal state level and nation state level.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>all sovereign local communities receive a share of all properties from the regional/provincial/cantonal state as well as from the nation state, proportional to the numbers of inhabitants.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>every local sovereign community is able to exit/quit/leave</p>
<p>at all times</p>
<p>without conditions</p>
<p>the regional/provincial/cantonal state</p>
<p>and the nation state</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>after such a consequential decentralisation ... when every one of the more than 2000 local communities in switzerland would be able to make its own laws and decide what exactly the people who live here and now together as neighbours would want to use the inherited share of the 300 billions worth of national bank capital reserves previously owned by the 26 cantons...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>not only would it be possible to create a lifestyle where all food and heating and building/shelter requirements could be covered by the local ressources ... land used for agriculture and forests ... but also a potential 1.6 million human beings could be invited to come here and be full citizens of this or that local sovereign community</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the big advantage of such a renewal of state constitutions approach would be ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>that every local community could decide for its very self... in its very own style and liking ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>wether or not the people who live here together as neighbours</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and would be able to decide in the circle of equals</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>no representatives needed, no councils needed</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>just the full assembly of all inhabitants, all children, youth and adults who live here and now, each one with the same weighted voting power</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>would be able to decide wether or not they would want to buy the land off the farmers to bring it into communal ownership and then distribute it again to everyone equally as a free of cost lifelong lease</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and wether or not the people living here and now would want to decide in the circle of equals wether or not to buy the forests from private owners and bring it into communal ownership so that everyone might gather firewood from fallen branches and dead trees ... so that no one alive tree would be felled any more</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the people who live here and now in this local sovereign community ... after it would have received, inherited the political sovereign powers from the cantonal and nation state for example trough a constitutional renewal ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>could decide wether or not they would want to invite how many people who are living in these days in difficult situations in refugee camps</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how much of the riches amassed with the swiss national bank ... riches what also came into existance via feudal and colonial unfair doings, swiss people exploiting african and american indigenous people, enslaving them, stealing their lands ... forcing them and many of their childrens generations to work without pay</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how much of the inherited riches with the swiss national bank the people who live here and now would want to invest into repairing some of the damage the swiss collaboration in the colonial evil doings have caused ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>damages to indigenous societies of the americas, africa, asia ... what are the cause of why today 80 million people on this planet are refugees, are fleeing from war and economic too hard to bear conditions</p>

        <p>As someone that has gone through depression at an early age, this was the statement that broke me out of it.  I repeat it to others to see if it has the same effect on them.  There will be hundreds of others that will be there with soft, kind words.  That tactic might not work though.  Have to try multiple tactics to see what takes.</p>
