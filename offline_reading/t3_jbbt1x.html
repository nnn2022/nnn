    <strong>Being Anti-New Normal Does Not Equate to Selfishness</strong>
    <p><p>The doomers constantly call anyone who wants COVID restrictions removed and get back to life as selfish individuals that only care about individual freedoms and don't care about others or society in general. Personally, I'll say that couldn't be further from the truth. I'm adamantly anti lockdowns and "New Normal" and care deeply about society and the world around me. What I see is COVID doomerism and restrictions destroying society, and its worse in the places that are the most authoritarian. So many people are moving out of NYC right now that people have to book moving trucks months in advance. That can't be explained by fear of the virus itself as it's been many months since NYC was a big hotspot, it's about the lockdowns. I've heard similar stories from many other cities that have taken the same path.</p>
<p>Does anyone really think society is better off in California or Victoria, Australia right now than it is in Sweden or South Dakota? The lockdowns are destroying both individual rights and the greater good of society. I consider both important myself, and they aren't opposing ideals. A society with a healthy amount of individual rights is more resilient than a more centralized, controlled society. An authoritarian society has all its eggs in one basket, so to speak, the consequences of a failed decision can be more ruinous than a society in which individuals and groups of people can persue different options and come to find what works best in a more organic way.</p>
<p>Really, I think most of the doomers are either scared themselves or just engaging in tribal behavior, and convincing themselves its for the greater good. The level of fear in our society has been getting more extreme for many years. I see it differently in part because I'm just not that scared of death. Hopefully I have a number of decades of healthy life still ahead of me, being in my 30s, but I know if I manage to live to be old I'll eventually get to a more vulnerable state, but frankly, the thought of dying of COVID or something similar one day is less scary to me than the thought of living in a society that's ever more fearful, authoritarian and polarized. I hope by the time I get old that society has abandoned the idea that the old have to be protected "for their own good" and used as cash cows for the medical industry and instead accepted that death is a natural conclusion to life.</p></p>

        <p>It's really hard for me to understand why doomers think how they do. It seems that they're content with simply existing instead of living, and that really upsets me. I'd rather chance having a short life that is free and exciting than be basically forced in a box of "saftey" and live until I age out. </p>
<p>Throwing freedom away just because your told to, is a slap in the face to our ancestors who died for it. I find is so depressing that the masses take it all for granted and just don't give a shit.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, it's awful. This year was the year I had finally got the proper diagnosis and treatment for my mental health. I felt great for a month and then this all happened. I honestly feel like my worst nightmare is unfolding before my eyes and very few care. It's horrifying what everyone is allowing to happen. I hate to say it but I am grateful I sought help when I did because had I not, I'm not sure I'd be here.</p>

        <p>Same. I had finally gotten some therapy and had a balanced view on the future and then it immediately came crashing down on me. I've started trying therapy again because everything is somehow worse than where I was in November and am trying virtual events to meet people after resisting for months on my new therapist's advice. The fact that I'm now on waitlists for virtual events is less helpful than it is fuel to want to d i e.</p>

        <p>Yeah I am still doing therapy. I've never heard of virtual events, not sure I'd like that. It is tough, but we have to hang in there even though it's hard some days. As I am sure you do too, I just want my life back.</p>

        <p>I just heard Mark Crispin Miller's interview on a radio show/podcast called Wiki Politiki. He mentioned a study from Denis Rancourt that analyzed a sharp increase in "excess deaths" in April and found that it was due to loneliness in older people shut up in hospitals and nursing homes, unable to see their loved ones:</p>

        <p>Even worse are the ones that claim that wearing masks is freedom and not wearing them is throwing away what our ancestors fought for. I seriously had someone argue with me and say this. I told them that wearing masks is actually the opposite of that, but their argument was that if we don't wear masks, we'll get lockdown. So I have to choose between one pile of shit and another less smelly one that the government chooses to offer me? What happened to having a good, free life?</p>

        <p>There is nothing more selfish and sociopathic than ignoring the child abuse happening in schools because it makes you feel safer.  This has been the most shocking element of everything to me.  <em>Are there any adults left in the world?</em> I would easily rather die than have this done to children. Of course those aren't the choices, but if I actually believed it ...</p>

        <p>I'm still bitter about the "selfish" label. Is it "selfish" for a poor person to steal bread? The isolation of lockdowns nearly killed me, I healed by finding people to hang out with in person, and I refuse to be shamed for doing what I need to do to survive</p>

        <p>Back in April, I was downright suicidal due to fear of the virus. I told my boyfriend I would kill myself before I got it because I figured if it was that deadly, there was no difference. At the time, he was very much a "doomer" (he's since lightened up somewhat), yet even he was terrified I said that and suddenly, no shits were given about restrictions (we live in different states). He wanted me to come there <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>I calmed down when I very clearly did not drop dead, and I don't feel any shame for hanging out with him or my friends. The irony of this is I was very much an indoor person before all this happened. Now, all I want to do is go out.</p>

        <p>Don’t be bitter. This line is trotted out almost invariably by the most sheep-like uneducated people who are obsessed with their own image. They often violate their own stupid rules. I mean they wanna talk selfish-what could be more selfish than teachers unions jeopardizing the education of kids so THEY can live with marginally less risk while also getting paid? Or demanding cancer surgeries be cancelled because of the fear of COVID despite the imminent threat to their loves of cancer-which is WAY deadlier than COVID?</p>

        <p>You should google a concept called Hayek’s fatal conceit. It’s the idea that there’s no way a central planner can have all the information needed to manage society. Society is the product of millions of decisions made by individuals according to their own preferences. The circumstances of each person is too diverse for it to be possible to write a law that maximizes each person’s happiness. For some people it makes sense to take more precautions for others it doesn’t make sense based on their circumstances. One size fits all doesn’t work.</p>

        <p>Fairly certain I know what city you’re referring to. And didn’t that county move even further into the Orange category now? But now the city is just enacting it’s own restrictions even though the state said they could reopen? I think that’s what I heard.</p>

        <p><em>We're</em> the ones being selfish?  Some mighty impressive mental gymnastics, there.  We're the ones going out and about and risking this illness, aren't we?  Yes, it's a small risk, but it's still a risk.  And it's a risk we're willing to take, and even to expose our loved ones to.  Our opponents, on the other hand, opt to lock down for "as long as it takes" for some reliable countermeasure to be developed. </p>
<p>Many (at least of those I talk to) will say that they don't require a vaccine; they'll settle for solid treatments- which sounds reasonable, until you look at the treatments we have for other viral infections (not the symptoms, the infections themselves).  They're willing to put everyone through the nightmare of extended lockdowns to save themselves (and those they care about) from the risks of an infection that doesn't kill anyone who would've lived long without it.  And they have the guts to call <em>someone</em> here is being selfish- but it ain't us.</p>

        <p>While I agree that what you're saying is true for many if not most of lockdown supporters, we also need arguments against those of them who are immune and still support lockdowns. Some of them are paternalistic collectivists that really believe they are helping us even if we don't want their help. For those kind I guess we can raise the psychologial egoism theory that basically says that even altruists are actually egocentrics.</p>

        <p>For a few years now I've been advocating online against the growing weaponization and scaremongering in the media and social media of public health moral panics, issues like sugar taxes and mandatory vaccination. So early on from January I've been extensively writing against the "novel coronavirus" panic, explaining in January and February that the data from Wuhan and Hubei was unreliable and elsewhere the CFR (and the IFR) was well below 1%, calming down people that were certain the whole world was dying exponentially within few days and stressing that without excess mortality data we can't rule out the 2009 "swine flu" fiasco.</p>
<p>Of course, after the excess mortality data started to come from Europe and New York in late March and Early April, the debate was no longer about whether this is more deadly than average seasonal flu (except for children) and more about by how much and how it compares to bad flu seasons over the world in recent decades, and how the public policy in reaction to covid is so much different then what it was to those flu seasons and more broadly how much excess mortality (taking into account changes in size and ages of the population when making comparisons to past years) should be tolerated in a free society before the government should start implementing draconian measures to "save life at all cost".</p>
<p>My greatest fear is that lockdown advocates would win the debate and use this win to advance all their other lunatic draconian public health interventions that one could imagine. If locking up millions of young healthy people "for the public good" (imitating China) becomes the norm, then I fear we're not so far from a day when mass kidney harvesting from young healthy people "for the public good" will happen too, for example. There are claims they're doing it in China to political prisoners.</p>

        <p>That's because they are Communist. Look at what America did to Communists during the Cold War. Amazing how they can manipulate society so thoroughly in a mere 80 years.</p>
