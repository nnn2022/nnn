    <strong>Got the vax</strong>
    <p><p>I got the vax in late-April, I’m in good shape and pretty healthy. I work for the USG and the benefits of getting the vax seemed to outweigh the (known) negatives. I just wanted to say fuck Fauci and all his BS. Everyone is responsible for making their own decisions about their personal health and fuck you for trying to sway people with stupid slogans, billboards with catch phrases &amp; 15 second radio ads. Your body is all you have right now. Take care of it, for nothing is promised except the present.</p></p>

        <p>That’s why this sub is so hated by the Left wing hive-mind that is Reddit. </p>
<p>So many Redditors don’t value personal choice or personal freedom. They hate everyone and everything that they can’t control. People refusing the vaccine and refusing to go along with all this COVID bullshit are the epitome of everything they hate because they can’t control them.</p>

        <p>That’s exactly what it is and why I don’t cave or bow, it’s because it’s about control.
One girl got the vax and she’s breastfeeding because of peer pressure, her baby got hives from breastfeeding and she was upset and kinda confronted her friend group about pressuring her to get it and now baby has hives, her friends didn’t reply to her and just ignore her, they don’t care about her, they only wanted to control her and now that something bad is happening there’s no support from them at all and she’s stuck without her friend group and a vaccine that’s giving her side effects and she had to stop breastfeeding and give formula instead,
It’s sickening tbh</p>

        <p>But this type of post doesn't help either as you assume everyone choosing not to vaccinate is right-wing.</p>
<p>Our next door neighbor is obsessively right-wing and was still one of those queued up for her vaccination.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I've been left-wing my entire life and I still won't vaccinate. </p>
<p>IMO, it has nothing to do with left or right wing and everything to do with people who think for themselves versus those that don't, and you get those people in both camps.</p>

        <p>And yet here I am. Neither left nor right. I'm sort of Jeffersonian. I hold multiple opposing ideas in my head just like he did. I used the term Left because that is what I was. I was young and stupid or maybe the term would be uninformed and uneducated. I feel like Reagan must have felt when he went from liberal to conservative. Again I am using the terms loosely. Obviously Reagan had an awakening of sorts.</p>

        <p>Reagan was full of crap. He’s an actor. Lifetime democrat until a spot opened up for Republican president. He banned open carry in California and is top 4 all time increasing the national debt. Both are far from Conservative. He talked about the founders a lot, but his actions showed otherwise.</p>

        <p>WTF? Look at all the authoritarian shit the left wing has done or swept under the rug over the last 18 months and let me know how you can still say that. It has become 100% clear since the start of COVID that the dominant ideology of the left today in the US is collectivist authoritarian. AKA Chinese, centrally planned economy/communism. Fuck that and fuck you for enabling it.</p>

        <p>True, and that is a good point. However, trends tend to reflect certain truths. If you look at the harshness of lockdowns, you’ll find that it was mostly blue states that had the most draconian measures. Also, you’ll find that far more liberals tend to take the vaccine and support strict lockdown measures than conservatives do. It’s not absolute, but it’s definitely a trend</p>

        <p>The irony of saying that is a left leaning POV when literally being a leftist used to mean the freedom to do whatever you want that doesn’t harm others.</p>
<p>It’s disturbing. But the right is just as guilty for similar tactics and pigeonholing. It’s not about left or right, but those in power who want and have control. People who financially benefit from corruption and silencing of those that oppose their viewpoint since it threatens their plans and power.</p>

To begin with, the vaxx violates several federal US laws, including those against fraud and terrorism, but this is just the tip of the iceberg.

        <p>It’s not like the drug was approved outright or completely ignoring that boards opinion on the studies.  It’s for those who have at the moment only the option to let Alzheimer’s slowly destroy everything and everyone they’ve learned and know to them.</p>
<p>My Dad passed away from a form of Parkinson’s and after seeing that at 27 years old, I sure as hell would take it as fast as I could if I was diagnosed today and it was available.  Ambiguous but overall positive studies and all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fdas-decision-approve-new-treatment-alzheimers-disease">What the Data Show The late-stage development program for Aduhelm consisted of two phase 3 clinical trials. One study met the primary endpoint, showing reduction in clinical decline. The second trial did not meet the primary endpoint.  In all studies in which it was evaluated, however, Aduhelm consistently and very convincingly reduced the level of amyloid plaques in the brain in a dose- and time-dependent fashion.  It is expected that the reduction in amyloid plaque will result in a reduction in clinical decline.</a></p>
<p>Don’t forget this is only approved for someone who is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and in many cases in the thick of how awful Alzheimer’s proves itself to be.</p>
<p>If that was you and especially if you were very early in what is a death sentence, you’d take it, and if you didn’t, that would be just dumb.  You’re going to die for certain and will of long lost all your memories and personality by the time you die.</p>
<p>No one quit over safety concerns of the drug.</p>

        <p>I mean, they resigned because approving it risks complacency In Alzheimer’s research.  Basically this Pharma company is going to heavily reduce their R/D for the drug which may, and probably will, delay improvements to the drug over time.</p>
<p>Other companies are almost certainly working on their own versions and if different enough, will be seen sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>If what everyone else could conjure up is pretty close to this approved drug, they’ll have to wait until the patent expires to start providing their own version.</p>

        <p>These so-called "vaccines," or more accurately industrial pharmaceutical chemicals, are the product of gain of function research, funded in part by the DoD. None of these drugs confer immunity, like real vaccines, but do come with numerous mechanisms of injury and death. They contain HIV, prions, toxic lipid or even iron oxide nanoparticles, PEG and who knows what else. They were clearly designed to maim and kill. So yes, they're bioweapons.</p>

        <p>No. You said the vaccines (of which I only saw Pfizer studied within those papers), “contain HIV, [and] prions.” This is misleading and I would argue, fearmongering. </p>
<p>Your sources detail a distinctive <em>similarity</em> between certain parts of a specific Covid strain, and HIV. “Homology,” does not mean that there is HIV within the strain. As someone else stated, the genome of humans is within 99% similarity for other species, yet these species are distinctively different from each other, and humans. The presence of similarity in the genome does not denote the presence of HIV. Your own articles say as much, and simply state that this <em>could be</em> evidence of laboratory tampering, and will only serve to increase our knowledge about how to treat those particular strains of Covid. </p>
<p>Likewise, there are <em>no prions within Covid strains.</em> There are PrDs, which have only been hypothesized about. Your paper hypothesizes primarily, that the sections of Covid that contain such prion-<em>like</em> structures, are likely used to facilitate better spread for the virus, increasing it’s ability to attach to hosts. It seems to me that the closest thing to prions within the virus, <em>could be</em> analogues of prions. But there isn’t evidence to support the assertion that they produce Alzheimers or Diabetes or any other disease. </p>
<p>Your resources provide sufficient evidence to suggest artificial implementations to the virus, but nothing more. Your original comment is blatant misinformation. You cannot assert that there is HIV or Prions buried within Covid-19 <em>because there is no evidence to support that.</em> Only speculations from people who are clearly more qualified than you. You’re fearmongering in a sub that is biased to believe you without further analysis.</p>

<p>Right, it's "fearmongering" and "misleading" because you don't like it.</p>
<p>&rt;Your sources detail a distinctive similarity between certain parts of a specific Covid strain, and HIV. “Homology,” does not mean that there is HIV within the strain. As someone else stated, the genome of humans is within 99% similarity for other species, yet these species are distinctively different from each other, and humans. The presence of similarity in the genome does not denote the presence of HIV. Your own articles say as much, and simply state that this could be evidence of laboratory tampering, and will only serve to increase our knowledgeabout how to treat those particular strains of Covid.</p>
<p>No, read the abstract again. They admit that there is:</p>
<p>"A contiguous region representing 2.49% of the whole COVID-19 genome of which 40.99% is made up of 12 diverse fragments <strong>originating</strong> from various strains of HIV SIV retroviruses."</p>
<p>So it's not just homology; they're saying these HIV fragments were actually inserted into the SARS-CoV-2 genome from other HIV and SIV viruses.</p>
<p>Your point about genomic similarity between different species is a *non sequitur*, since we're talking about the presence of HIV insertions that are unlikely to be fortuitous because of their non-random location, their absence in other SARS-related coronaviruses, their ability to modify gene expression and the abnormally high ratio of syn/non-syn mutations on the spike. In fact, the evidence of HIV insertion is so strong the authors come out in favor of lab manipulation of the SARS coronavirus using HIV.</p>
<p>&rt;Likewise, there are no prions within Covid strains. There are PrDs, which have only been hypothesized about. Your paper hypothesizes primarily, that the sections of Covid that contain such prion-like structures, are likely used to facilitate better spread for the virus, increasing it’s ability to attach to hosts. It seems to me that the closest thing to prions within the virus, could be analogues of prions. But there isn’t evidence to support the assertion that they produce Alzheimers or Diabetes or any other disease.</p>
<p>OK, I should have said <em>prionogenic</em>, rather than just prions, although there is evidence that peptides on the spike protein are functionally infectious amyloids, so I wasn't off base. Furthermore, the authors don't just hypothesize about the existence of PrDs. They <strong>identify</strong> their existence on the spike using a PLAAC algorithm. </p>
<p>We don't have sufficient evidence that spike will definitely produce Alzheimer's, given these drugs weren't even tested before being rolled out, but we do have sufficient grounds for believing spike is a potential risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative disease (again, see the Classen paper).</p>
<p>&rt;Your resources provide sufficient evidence to suggest artificial implementations to the virus, but nothing more. Your original comment is blatant misinformation. You cannot assert that there is HIV or Prions buried within Covid-19 because there is no evidence to support that. Only speculations from people who are clearly more qualified than you. You’re fearmongering in a sub that is biased to believe you without further analysis.</p>
<p>Actually, there is more than sufficient evidence to believe there is HIV in the SARS genome. PrDs have also been discovered on the spike. These aren't just speculations, but hard evidence produced by experts on HIV and PrDs. Furthermore, these PrDs <em>may</em> trigger protein misfolding and lead to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. I don't see how this is misinformation. If anything, your misrepresentation and dismissal of the evidence is misinformation.</p>
<p>I find the accusation of fearmongering odd given the entire Covid-19 vaxx campaign promoted by your kind is based on terrorist fearmongering and bullying.</p>

        <p>Oh fuck off with that “your kind” bullshit. The first thing I said was that I support an individual’s choice. I said it’s misleading because it’s an inaccurate representation of the data, regardless of my stance on the issue.

<p>HIV <em>fragments</em> are not the same either. That would fit into the category of homologous. It also specifically states that this is only a detail they hypothesize could be used to aid treatment options—<em>not</em> that somehow these segments are analogues of full blown HIV. On top of the fact that I also explicitly said that those sources provide evidence of laboratory tampering of the virus itself—not <em>necessarily</em> the vaccine. </p>
<p>I have never validated or agreed with the way the vaccine has been marketed, but certainly the best way to combat fearmongering is to fabricate something scarier. This is what it appears to me that you are doing.</p>

        <p>I'm not an expert but when reading the abstract and the conclusion, the first paper states that the virus likely has undergone laboratory modifications. Yes, I seems to have some matches with the HIV virus but humans also have an 80% match with cows so the key takeaway doesn't seem to be the match with other viruses like HIV but the abnormal rate of mutation or something. The paper itself also doesn't seem to put much emphasis on the HIV part.</p>

<p>I'm really not sure about the use of the word "insertion". Common words can gain a new meaning in a specific scientific field.

<p>There are HIV-1 insertions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that are not found on any other SARS-related coronavirus. How did they get there? Gene sequences don't appear out of nowhere, not without evolutionary intermediates or presence in other closely related lineages. Their presence is strongly indicative of lab manipulation. </p>
<p>It's interesting you bring up mutations. Researchers have pointed out a high ratio of synonymous/non-synonymous mutations on S2 of the spike, indicating purifying selection and thus less genetic diversity. This goes against our understanding of evolutionary biology, since viruses move from host to host, creating novel interactions and genome-wide signatures of positive selection. Relatively conserved regions of S2 are yet another indication of lab manipulation.</p>
<p>&rt;The paper itself also doesn't seem to put much emphasis on the HIV part.</p>
<p>Actually it does, very heavy emphasis on the presence of HIV in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Maybe try reading the entire paper?</p>
<p>&rt;The emails are only referring to the first paper?</p>
<p>No, the emails refer to an entirely different paper, one that the authors were apparently bullied into retracting, but confirm that Fauci's associates were well aware of the HIV-1 insertions on the spike protein.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm really not sure about the use of the word "insertion". Common words can gain a new meaning in a specific scientific field. Idk if insertion actually implies laboratory insertions of genetic sequences. Or simply the existence of new DNA where it previously didn't. "Insertion" could be a word that expresses the existance of new DNA without any connotations about its origin. </p>
<p>"Insertion" in this case just refers to gene sequences from HIV-1 added to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. You answered your own question.</p>
<p>&rt;To come back to the vaccine discussion. What does HIV have to do with the vaccine? Even if the virus contains some DNA sequences of HIV, it wouldn't really count as "the vaccine contains HIV".</p>
<p>Because the vaxx would contain a synthetic copy of the genes for the spike protein, which would also code for those same HIV insertions.</p>

<p>True, but I think a much, much stronger case can be made for lab manipulation than natural evolution of the virus. See Nicholas Wade's long article for an exhaustive summary of the evidence: <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/">The origin of COVID: Did people or nature open Pandora’s box at Wuhan?</a></p>

        <p>First, I really appreciate your thoughtful reply.</p>
<p>I see a case for lab manipulations but I really don't see a connection to the vaccine.
If the vaccine contains DNA sequences of HIV, it can be logically explained by the existance of the same traces in the virus.</p>

<p>No one is forcing you to get the vaccine.  </p>
<p>If your work requires it, they have that right to do so. Their building—their rules.  Same goes for concerts and event that may require proof of vaccination.</p>

        <p>Except beyond the "official" consequences of our choices we are also being ostracized by friends and family, which is a direct result of the propaganda they are consuming. I think most of us here can accept that we won't be able to go to a concert or whatever, but our liberal loved ones have been completely brainwashed. At least that's my perspective. It's NOT a choice when everyone you know is pressuring you to get it, and that reflects deep societal fissures.</p>

        <p>It’s not propaganda.  If it is, then so is whatever ya’ll are reading. That consists nearly entirely of blogs with Cherry picked specific selections of actual studies taken and used out of context to conveniently construe it to be favorable to what you want the answer to be.</p>
<p>There is far more evidence that the vaccine is effective and safe for the vast and I mean vast majority, than there is  it is some sort of bio weapon cooked up by elites to control the population of workers they need for their businesses.  </p>
<p>Makes a whole lot of sense to only ya’ll because ya’ll are the only ones taking huge and highly questionable jumps in reasoning and critical thinking.  So, it should be eye opening to you that you and a few others are the only ones mentally lost enough to follow your path of thinking and still think it makes sense right now.</p>
<p>You can also just try not arguing with your friends and family about the vaccine and your blogs that claim it is evil.  Just don’t say anything about it and don’t jump into conversation about things you have no concrete evidence or proof backing it up.  Just theory.</p>

        <p>It's our right to stand against the discriminatory covid-19 vax mandates. We shouldn't have to inject anything into our blood stream to live normal lives. If discrimination based on the vaccine is okay, then, discrimination based on race &amp; religion is okay do you understand? Anything else is double standards.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this notion that unvaccinated people are a threat to public health and immunocompromised peoples is not backed by real science. If the covid vaccine is eFfEcTiVe than nobody should worry about us unvaccinated people, don't forget that it's scientifically proven and now backed by the WHO and CDC that vaccinated people can spread Covid just as us unvaxxed can spread can do the same (those who are immunocompromised are at risk from both groups equally).</p>
<p>Admit it, you and folks like you obsessed with us taking the vax have no science or data backing you, and if you have any, it's 2020 pseudo science that contradicts literally everything we thought we knew about virology for centuries! Repeat after me "Unvaccinated people are not a threat to public health" and now repeat "Vaccine mandates are discrimination".</p>

        <p>Listen I don’t care if you get vaccinated or not.  I’m protected.<br>
It’s ya’ll going off all the time and always trying to be the loudest person in the room of vaccinated people that creates 90% of your image crisis.  Ya’ll rarely look like a trustworthy person getting in fights with Walmart employees or just going in to walk around yelling sweet nothings as some sort of “protest”.</p>
<p>If y’all just minded your own damn business no one would know the difference of if your vaccinated or not.</p>
<p>But you have to keep going off spouting theories and baseless accusations because you can’t handle the consequences of your choice.</p>
<p>Lastly, Vaccination is a not a protected class, so no, it is not the same as discriminating against someone based on race because, wait for it, you are making a choice with known consequences by not getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Hilarious and concerning, but not surprising, you would think someone’s race they were born into is the same discrimination as anti-Vaxers and their pseudo science and blogs.</p>

        <p>Lotteries and free donuts for getting a vaccine isn't propaganda? Ok then. We'll just disagree on that one.</p>
<p>I don't believe the propaganda that the vaccine is going to kill the entire world or any other dire predictions. As with almost everything in the news, the truth is in the middle. I based my decision to not get the shot on my friends and family members' reactions. Most of them were knocked on their ass for 1-3 days. One friend got her shot months ago and still has an inflamed lymph node. My SIL has had a horrific rash since she got her shot a month ago. I'm not believing what I read, I'm believing what I see with my own eyes.</p>

        <p>You can get it or not get it and it’s all the same to me.  </p>
<p>I get how that could be viewed as propaganda, but it is quite clearly and obviously a bribe.  The vaccine could have serious longterm health consequences, that’s possible just the same as it is safe for the majority and life goes on.  The bribes are because our scientific community and community leaders believe(based on real evidence from real data) in the vaccine and could very well be offering it because it is the best and most effective thing available to us to fight the spread of COVID.</p>
<p>What a lot of you have done here is only cook up a narrative based on flimsy-loosely tied influential “bad actors” and theories.</p>

        <p>You sound like a reasonable human being. Most people in NNN are also reasonable if you read through some of the less meme-y posts. I do think COVID is real and precautions should be taken to protect the vulnerable. I also think mal-intentioned bureaucrats saw the crisis as an opportunity to seize power and money at the expense of the populace. Was COVID really worth transferring nearly $2 trillion from the middle/lower class to the elite? Because that is something we will be feeling the effects of forever.</p>

<p>COVID had really odd effects on things and quite contrary to what I at least was expecting when we face the reality of lock downs and hospital beds dangerously close to even emergency level capacity.</p>
<p>But there is one thing we can always count on, at least for the foreseeable future— The rich will write themselves cashiers checks for millions and billions of dollars while nickel and dim’n the tax payers to send as little money as they possibly can back to them directly or through tax supported services.</p>
<p>There’s always a deficit problem when it comes to getting tax dollars to help the actual fucking tax payers.</p>

        <p>Same. I got the vax but you know what I didn't do? I didn't go carrying around my friggin vaccine card showing it at every store I went in to to take off my mask. Sorry...that's not anyone's business. I'm not carrying a piece of ID to live my normal life.</p>

        <p>I’ve said it alot.  We’re painted as antivax. We’re not. This sub is pro personal choice and research.  I do not disrespect anyone for getting it or not.  Me personally, I had covid and am fine.  I have allergies to medicines so my doctor says she wouldn’t recommend I get this vaccine. I don’t care if you got it or don’t, I just don’t want anyone telling me I need to put myself at risk of a reaction</p>

        <p>Same. I have not had a vaccine since I was about 10 years old, as I have never seen the need to.</p>
<p>If someone else chooses to vaccinate against Covid, not my business. But it is my business when my rights are being taken away for not getting an experimental vaccine, and when the government is saying I should hand over control of my body to them. Fuck that.</p>

        <p>The fact that in another post here everyone was calling all the people giving kdis shots "child abusers" doesn't really lend to the pro choice aspect everyone claims. I don't care if another person is for or against a vaccine, but when there's this much of a negative stigma spread in the sub about sheeple getting the vaccine, whether they're informed or not, paints everyone in a certain light</p>

        <p>I like this post. I've always felt control influence over others is a evil in life. I would never bash or yell at somebody for wearing a mask or for getting a vaccine. I'd hope people would respect the same nor try to force your views on people. Everyone is free and I hope everyone is happy and gets what they desire.</p>

<p>Edit: and to be honest- you can't even go back to school for anything because almost every school will require it now too. Very few middle/lower class people at the end of this will have the privilege of maintaining their livelihood without getting the experimental gene therapy.</p>

Turn it up high enough and you’ll get a positive, goes the other way too, turn it down and it looks like the vax is working, you’re being manipulated</p>

<p>Indeed. As long as getting vaccineutered is voluntary. The amount of coercion is disconcerting.</p>

        <p>I got fully vaxxed on May 4th. I am in Puerto Rico. Governor today announced the end of mandatory masks for vaccinated people (everywhere, although pretty sure some businesses will still require it as per the owner’s decision). Tonight I got into a debate with an “expert” on Twitter who disagrees with the decision, I was insisting as per why we need to worry about the delta variant if the vaccine is 90% effective, she kept into stupid arguing and I ended up blocking her. It is evident these charlatans want to extend the bullshit to continue getting more and more money. If I got vaccinated I did it to go fully back to normal, not to act like I wasted my time.</p>

I have a feeling they might continue to terrorize everyone this way, like you need the booster twice a year to keep your passport up to date or to stay open</p>

        <p>I work at a hospital in a non-clinal area. I held off for a while, but the pressure campaign went off the chain from administration and I have 2 other people depending on me for my income. The campaign went from peer pressure to prizes offered, and we all know what comes next. The firing of those nurses at Houston Methodist Hospital was the last straw.</p>
<p>So I saw getting it as protecting my family, not from the virus but from the fallout of me not having a job. And for some dumb reason I also justified it as "well at least I'll add to the vaccinated tally and we can then all get back to normal", can't believe I convinced myself that there would be no bait and switch.</p>
<p>Again, it was all self rationalizing as this would be a hard job and income to replace. No one should be in this situation in the supposed land of the free.</p>

        <p>That's what it should always have been. People have a choice. The majority of us are not anti-vax (no disrespect to anti-vaxxers, personal choice is personal choice). We just want the right to our physical integrity. Anyone that wants to get it, by all means go an get jabbed. But when you do it uninformed we have a problem there, especially since government silences any doctor trying to do their job by informing people of the risk.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, only one side is pushing for control. Only one side is pushing mandatory experimental gene therapy. Only one side is trying to strip you of your god given liberties as a human being. Only one side is manipulating public perception. Only one side is lying to you. And only one side is avoiding healthy public debate about these things. Whoever chooses that side, should look themselves in the mirror everyday and fucking ask themselves "Is this who I wanted to be when I was a kid?", and if their answer is yes, well... personal choice, but they're still a fucking dumbass.</p>

        <p>No matter what happens to me, good or bad, camps etc etc
I know I did the right thing through this.
I am not taking that vaccine, I didn’t coerce anyone into doing anything, I didn’t pressure anyone into doing anything, I tried to warn people, I’ve donated to a few go fund me of people with adverse reaction that can’t work anymore and have stacks and stacks of medical bills while big pharma makes billions off their misery.
I’m not perfect, but I can live with myself and look at myself in the mirror.</p>

        <p>Appreciate the honesty. That’s what this sub is about. We just want people to live their lives, be free to make their own choices, and understand and accept the possible rewards/consequences that come with those choices.</p>
<p>Trying to force someone to NOT take the vaccine is just as bad as trying to force someone TO take the vaccine. Both are authoritarianism that violate the idea of a free society</p>

        <p>I got Sinovac a few days ago here in Singapore because my wife is Chinese and I won't be able to see her family or travel to China again without. I weighed the R/R, and thankfully Sinovac is developed on old technology, and I've felt no side effects at all 2 days after taking it.</p>
<p>You'd have to put a gun to my head to get me to take any of the others at the moment. I'm healthy and don't need any of them, Sinovac included, to be honest.</p>

        <p>I got it too, about the same time.  I felt the benefits outweighed the risks, so I chose to get it. I still don't like the way the public discussion is about it.  There's no nuance about it, and you either think everyone from age 0-100 should get it without question or your an anti vaxxer.  There's no nuance or risk assessment, and in some cases,  few benefits to getting it.  We were promised these would be the way our of all these restrictions, but now people want to carry on as if the vaccines do nothing.</p>

        <p>Thank you for posting this. I feel kinda alienated from the rest of you guys since I got the vax too. But I think it was a worthy sacrifice to have my life back, as infuriating as it is. I also experienced no side effects.</p>

        <p>Are you worried about being coerced into taking boosters? I’m worried for the vaxxed people that they’re going to hold you all hostage saying if you don’t have booster then you’re passport is invalid and you’ll be in the same boat as the rest of us anyway, and how many boosters are they gonna make you guys take? Once a year, twice a year? Forever?
Will you take the boosters?
What a disaster this is</p>

        <p>Yep I got mine (Pfizer) back in March. </p>
<p>In hindsight I probably shouldn't have been so eager (low 30's, zero underlying health issues blah blah) but at the time I thought cool let's do it. With the constant moving of the goal posts, outright lies and depict and the authoritarian measures many "trust the science!!11!" crowd is proposing I wish I didn't get it. </p>
<p>I got mine and I couldn't care less if someone doesn't get theirs. My brother and sister haven't gotten theirs (and brother probably won't) and it's something we never talk about because it's his choice.</p>

        <p>I agree, everyone has a personal choice and personal responsibility to their own body and health choices. I chose to say Fuck Fauci, the constant ads on TV, radio, the celeb jab endorsements, government sponsored ads by medical doctors, by NOT being part of his live experiment. I'll never trust a medical person, who lies about gain of function for a virus he helped create, who also helped pharmaceutical companies manufacture the jabs to 'stop' it. Who knows what the virus was meant to trigger, and who knows what the jab is meant to trigger. Both when a person like Fauci has control of both, you gotta question it.</p>

        <p>I agree with your post, vaccines are a personal decision.  I also got the Moderna vaccine in Jan/Feb with minimal side effects.  I am still alive and have the high amount of energy I did before.  </p>
<p>I am not a fan of the Garden Gnome (Fauci).  I'm not for a "new normal" of passports, these ridiculous restrictions and masks.  I hate masks!  I never wore one before the vaccine and I never did after either.</p>
<p>"You still have to" is all propaganda designed to find who can and can't be controlled.  I hang with both unvaccinated and vaccinated people, and I could care less.</p>

        <p>None of my family or friends give a shit that I don't want it. I didn't even know some of them had gotten the first one because they don't make a big announcement anywhere. 
My country also hasn't had many restrictions so there are no threats of "getting your freedom back" 
I feel sorry for the people who are getting bullied into getting it or fired and made to wear a mask at work and seen as a hazard.</p>
