        <p>Imagine you've lived your whole life being told how special you are, despite the fact that no one else seems to notice and you've never done anything worthwhile.  Maybe you've never held a steady job and live in a little apartment somewhere.  Or maybe you went to college because that's what you do, you picked a major from a list because that's what you do, you got a degree in something, and now have a job you know makes no difference in the world and you live in a house just like all the other houses on your street.  Doesn't matter.  Despite being so special, you're ordinary in every way.  The world doesn't appreciate you or how special you know you are.</p>
<p>But one day you get to be a superhero just by wearing a mask on your face.  Like everyone else.  Suddenly you matter.  Suddenly the world cares about you.   Suddenly, you're doing something extraordinary like saving lives, just by going with the flow like you've always done.  Suddenly, with a modicum of effort, you get to be as special and amazing as you've always known you are.  You are appreciated.  You're part of something bigger.  You matter.</p>
<p>But then you see some people who don't care about the heroic things you're doing.  Not just that, but they think you're stupid because of it.  They think you aren't special at all.  They think you're not a hero.  This itself is rage inducing.  If you're lucky that's as bad as it gets, but maybe deep down you know they're right.  They're not trying to take your superpowers, they're merely pointing out that you were never a hero at all.  You're ordinary, just like everyone else.  Shutting them up would be an accomplishment.  It would almost make you a hero again.</p>
<p>When you really put yourself in their shoes it's kind of sad.</p>

        <p>While the people who ARE suffering worked harder than they have their entire existence in a shorter period of time. As we're going through our trials, IF we don't commit suicide, and we some how make it ALL THE WHILE DEFYING THE RULES AND MANDATES, literally nothing has changed for the doomer except them wearing a mask.</p>
<p>No loss of income or social life because they were ALWAYS  shut ins. A joke. They  wouldn't even begin to know what adversity is, which is why they jump on any SJW protest they can to SIGNIFY <strong>not</strong> EMPATHIZE with the "neglected" and "shunned" of society.</p>

        <p>Or how about they're trying to get a sub shut down because they can't rationally debate the issues.
It's just easier to censor.</p>
<p>I also think blindly believing what the media or what an authority tells you is dumb.  They, don't want free thought and discussion of ideas.  They want to stomp down anyone who disagrees.</p>
<p>If you don't see a problem with that, then you've got bigger problems.</p>

        <p>The issue with this logic is that it can be applied to people who go against the media. </p>
<p>People blindly trust what they read on a person's blog and post it here. They see an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/?fbclid=IwAR0fCKpNBQrdUFfSWyxQT0X9y7PPj3ZahcmVUBClAXyDlJrWVQX_GvWyyYQ">article that "proves"</a> masks cause hypoxemia and think nothing more about it. In reality, the article was from <em>Medical Hypotheses</em>, described as a place <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/journals/medical-hypotheses/0306-9877/guide-for-authors">"to publish interesting theoretical papers. The journal will consider radical, speculative and non-mainstream scientific ideas provided they are coherently expressed."</a> So they basically blindly believed something that they thought was a truth, when in reality it was fiction.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, it is I who is downvoted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mqdg85/misinterpreting_vaers_reports_and_deceptive/">here</a> for my opinion. Does that seem familiar? For example, my post about the reality of VAERS reports was downvoted even though everything I said was factual and no one disproved what I said. So basically people downvoted me because they disagreed with me, not because I was wrong.</p>
<p>So now we're back to this discussion here. Do you think they are dumb because they have a differing opinion, or do you think they are dumb because they are factually incorrect? Because one of these is subjective and the other is objective. And if you want to be political, it's fine to be subjective, but if you want to be scientific, you best be objective if you want to have sound logic.</p>

        <p>Okay look, man, in the case you're not a shill I'll try to give some perspective.</p>
<p>Is there some misinformation here? Yes absolutely.</p>
<p>It's impossible to hit a home run bombshell article that is completely scientific, peer reviewed, watertight and void of opinion every single time a link is shared here.</p>
<p>I would say around half of the posts here are biased, lacking context, wrong, outdated, etc etc. The truth always lies somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>When the majority of the reasoning/evidence supporting the idea you're discussing is flawed, then it means your points are invalid. I can say that 2 + 2 = 5 and continuously be proven wrong, and I can still hold my stance. But don't you think it would be illogical for me to hold my stance?</p>

        <p>Why does it matter if it is an "authority" telling you something? The only difference on this sub is that it is a random stranger telling you something. People are still listening to whatever they read. They are not questioning their sources. The only difference is that people blindly follow what a medical expert says vs. someone who has no medical degree. I would rather follow what the medical expert says than some random person online.</p>
<p>If you wanted financial advice, would you go to a stranger online? Or would you go to the financial agency?</p>
<p>You can question the validity of the sources that the "authority" uses, there is nothing stopping you from doing that. However I have yet to see anyone refute what I have said about masks not causing hypoxemia or VAERS reports. I just get downvoted without anyone telling me how I am wrong.</p>
<p>Downvotes mean they are rejecting me without questioning the source's validity. The same thing you say this sub is supposed to NOT do.</p>

        <p>This isn't about financial advice.  That isn't exactly an exact science.  There's a lot of opinion involved.  I'm referring to what is called an "appeal to authority".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Appeal-to-Authority">Explanation </a></p>
<p>Basically, an argument isn't valid just because the person is an expert.  The argument stands or falls on its own.</p>
<p>&rt;However I have yet to see anyone refute what I have said about masks not causing hypoxemia or VAERS reports. I just get downvoted without anyone telling me how I am wrong.</p>
<p>The downvotes aren't right.  It sucks.  I know becaise the same thing happened to me on r/covid.  I agree masks don't cause any significant hypoxemia or hypercapnia.  VAERS is a poor reporting system.  You can't really belive what is there or what isn't there.</p>

        <p>There's a difference between having a discussion and consciously or unconsciously spreading misinformation, which is against Reddit's rules. That is why they want this subreddit shut down. Not because this subreddit has a differing opinion.</p>
<p>There are much better ways to discuss the negative effects of the lockdown without trying to prove that masks/vaccines are harmful. This sub could focus on economic effects or mental health or lack of health care due to lockdowns, however it is being dwarfed by posts about masks and vaccines.</p>

        <p>Masks are harmful though. The amount of controversy with these vaccines and side effects in just 4-5 months already with nothing known of the long term.
Just because the media tells you there's no relation to these events and the experimental vaccine, doesn't mean it's true. Media and government are well known with a long history of lying to push their agendas and profit. They're telling the truth this time though? When everything makes less sense than ever lol.</p>

        <p>Nah bro my days of providing sources on reddit are over. It's a losing battle in a world where up is down and facts don't matter. You don't believe me, I don't care. You want to look for yourself? Go ahead. You're already on this sub, take a scroll back and you'll find multiple postings of a recent study that not only adds to the list of studies that show masks make no difference in stopping the spread, but also shows the physical and psychological negatives of wearing a mask or two all day. </p>
<p>If your own common sense didn't tell you already that covering your airways all day and breathing carbon dioxide and bacteria is bad for you, there is science to back it up. The only science that says masks DO work came about in 2020. Along with this new notion of only achieving herd immunity through vaccination and the disappearance of the flu. You carry on thinking the bullshit we've been failing at for 13 months is gonna work eventually if you want, at this point I don't give a single fuck. I'm embarrassed to be part of the human race these days.</p>

        <p>I'm telling you I don't care. Believe what you want to, it is the lowest on my list of things to care about.
The original comment I made was about how banning subreddits is stupid and here we are.</p>
<p>If you want to wear a mask go ahead. I don't care if you listen to my argument.
I've been providing sources to people who ask for them all last year, and the response is always the same. If it's a source they don't recognize, that's the reason not to believe it. If it's an official source like the WHO and CDC, they will tell me I'm interpreting wrong or stop responding. I've linked the vaccine info packs that clearly state the lack of studies done in a number of areas and how they're only approved for emergency use and the trials actually end in 2023. The manufacturers wrote this themselves and I'm told I'm wrong. Facts don't matter to brainwashed people.</p>
<p>This is old and tired now, if you don't believe me and won't research for yourself then that's on you.</p>
