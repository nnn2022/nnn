    <strong>Why must we be vaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>So according to the woke mob, we the unvaccinated are evil deplorable people that deserve death. We are the scum of the earth.</p>
<p>The majority of us are right of center. We have been called many despicable things by the woke left, some if which I will now list. We are racists, nazis, xenophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, homophobic, white supremacist, anti science, anti vax, conspiracy theorists, fascists, flat eathers, Karen's, climate change deniers and greedy capitalist deplorables. We are ruining the earth with our climate change denial and we are making life worse for minorities with our racism and the world world be a great place without us.</p>
<p>Sooo, why cant they just let us unvaccinated evil people just die to covid? If covid really is so deadly and the vaccine is so good at protecting them, why try and force us to have it. Surely it would be better to let us go exstinct by allowing us to stay unvaccinated against a deadly virus. </p>
<p>All of life's problems can be solved by letting the deplorables die to covid. So why are they so passionate about us having their vaccine?</p>
<p>Its almost like they have an ulterior motive, an agenda of some sorts. </p>
<p>My question to the woke mob is, why can't you just let us die? Why must we be vaccinated when our demise would solve all your problems? Why must we be vaccinated?</p></p>

        <p>I disagree with you tying politics into this (I think most people's decision to vaccinate/ not vaccinate has nothing to do with their political leanings, and we come from across the political spectrum).  Plus, I'd hate to think that if Trump came out and said 'everyone must be vaccinated' we'd lose a big portion of people against the vaccine and all they sudden they'd be lining up for vaccines and condemning the unvaccinated - because that means they are not really understanding the health side of this discussion and are just being mindless parrots.</p>
<p>I whole-heartedly agree with the main point of your argument... if people hate vaccinated people so much and wish we'd die, and they truly believe unvaccinated people are all going to die, then why not just leave us be?  Let us all die off?</p>
<p>Perhaps they are afraid of us not dying without the vaccine, and proving their whole argument wrong.  It would destroy their entire belief system.</p>
<p>I asked one person in what way do non vaccinated people pose a threat to society, and he just spun in circles and couldn't answer.  At one point he said that vaccinated people with covid couldn't infect other people - as if getting the vaccine magically prevents you from spreading covid to others.  I guess he believes that instead of coughing and sneezing out the virus, you cough and sneeze out rainbows and ponies.</p>
<p>I have to wonder, if vaccinated sick or asymptomatic people think they're not infectious to others, perhaps it's them running around out in public with no mask on or precautions causing the spike in covid cases.  (Although granted, the masks do relatively nothing.)  They seem to think they have a god like quality that somehow makes them unable to infect others.</p>

        <p>Sick of people assuming you are right wing if you don’t want the vaccine. I dislike Joe Biden/Pelosi and Trump/McConnell equally, and as far as their policies it’s a mixed bag. Stop bringing republican vs democrat into a discussion it doesn’t belong in.</p>
