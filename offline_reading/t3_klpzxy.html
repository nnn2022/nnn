        <p>It's things like this picture that made people question their governments and scientific advisors to begin with at the onset because it just didn't seem right. When the science came out to prove our instincts correct, it further ingrained our sense of distrust. If the government wants to get angry at anyone for not complying with mandates, they only have themselves to blame for overreaching and being inconsistent.</p>

        <p>&rt;  that made people question their governments</p>
<p>Especially we should question the enforcement part of our government. I hate the people who are all like "just comply with the police and everything will be OK".  Those sheeple just don't know any better. </p>
<p>When the government's goons want to screw you over they'll find any reason: too slow to comply, <strong>no mask</strong>, in the wrong neighborhood, matched a description, etc.  We should question this! All of us should question this.</p>

        <p>If you insist on reducing my comment to a sophomoric critique of the image, then here's my rebuttal: </p>
<p>1) Why is the beach actually empty?  Many places closed beaches to avoid crowding so that it would be a safe place.  So yes, he's alone now, but it is a plausibility he is only alone on the beach due the everyone else following the rules that make it empty.  That is if that is the only reason the authority figure is pointing.  In reality, we have no clue about this context for this interaction.  If you blindly take the picture and the added caption you are doing the same thing this thread is railing against the "sheeple" for doing you're just trusting random people on the internet with no expertise or basis of trust. </p>
<p>2) The beach is non-essential, it doesn't sell groceries or medicine or essential supplies.   So drawing a comparison between the beach and a store like walmart, create a false equivalency. </p>
<p>3)My comment was directly to the comment it replied to. This was around trusting science and understand of that in the context of the entirety of this sub which is generally anti-mask in most (if not all) situations.  It is a direct rebuttal to the anti-authority view point in the prior comment.  </p>
<p>So instead of reducing the debate to the naive interpretation of the image.  Prove that you aren't just a blind follower of random people on the internet and engage in a real discussion.</p>

        <p>The point is it doesn't have to be, and especially it doesn't have to be actively an echo chamber.  Yet, here you are advocating for it.   When you give in to the "inevitable" you do the same thing that those who give in to "authority" are doing.</p>
<p>I think I'm better off trying to understand how people who do not think like me are seeing things and trying to share what information I am aware of to help break down those walls.  So I'd rather not stay in the confines of my own echo chamber, no one is better off with that outcome.</p>

        <p>You make several axioms that this subreddit doesn't agree with </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You assume all non essential activities should be shut down in your second argument. I fundamentally disagree that socially distanced activities should be shut down. The beach is a great socially distanced activity. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding your question about empty beaches, I grew up in San Diego. I've never seen a beach where people get less than 6 ft together except maybe the 4th of July. You claim your spot in an open area, throw your towels down, and start tanning or swimming or throwing a ball around. You can also look at the fucking photo.</p>

        <p>I do not think that word means what you think it means. </p>
<p>First off, neither of those are axioms for my comments (and the second one is not actually an axiom).   And I'll indicate why:</p>
<p>1) I have not presupposed my statements on the belief that non-essential activities should be shut down.  I don't even know where you are getting this from.  I merely stated a fact that several locations closed beaches due to them being non-essential.  </p>
<p>Instead, my presumption is that there are essential vs. non-essential functions and that the response to those is potential different and based on different factors for communities to make.  While I do  have a view on that, nothing in my comments is dependent on that view.</p>
<p>2) You don't really state an assumed axiom, but I'm going to guess that you're assuming I am taking as true without evidence that beaches can be crowded.  In fact, there is evidence for this, I've lived in many locations, with both oceanfront beaches and in-land beaches.  In all of these locations, there have definitely been times where the beach is crowded enough to not facilitate social distancing. Again, I'm not making a judgement that that implies they should be closed.  But rather there is potential for that to be the case.  Indeed, in my actual comment you'll see I only call out the beach closure as one possible reason for the interaction, but leave open that there are others. Since, we DO NOT actually know the reason for the interaction.</p>

<p>It means we have a difference in our core beliefs. If something is safe, i do not believe the government should restrict it. </p>

<p>X for doubt.  </p>
<p>I've been to Santa Monica during the Summer, Bondi Beach in December, and been to Pacific Beach on a triweekly basis for almost a decade (i ran on the beach). The only time I've seen a beach that's not socially distanced is the 4th of July.</p>

        <p>Wow, just so much here that's not just opinion or assumption but just wrong.  It's a really great bumper sticker to say if it's safe then it shouldn't be restricted.  But "safe" is not a black and white scale.  Every activity takes on a certain level of risk,  so breaking things apart as safe/not-safe  is a false dichotomy that you are using to justify a belief. At what level is something safe/not-safe?  CDC and other guidelines are not a classification system, but guidance to help achieve an acceptable level of risk. </p>
<p>Going to the grocery store, even with a mask, isn't always safe, but it can be essential (and I will continue to stay away from the word necessary for classification of activities).  Unless you think the government and corporations should engage in nuanced debates on how to restrict access to certain activities so that they are safe, e.g. rationing access, etc, , then you're belief is already struggling to stand up to the reality of enactment. </p>
<p>On the point about beaches, so you immediately discount my claim based on your experience of Pacific coast beaches?  But your geographically limited experience isn't easily extrapolated.  SE Florida and Key West during Spring Break, New England beaches on long weekends or the 4th of July can easily be crowded (though they aren't always crowded).  So while your experience is does not include that, it is unjustified to discount someone else's experience merely because you haven't seen it, e.g. <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/miami-dade/fl-ne-spring-break-miami-beach-new-strategy-20190322-story.html">https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/miami-dade/fl-ne-spring-break-miami-beach-new-strategy-20190322-story.html</a>.</p>

* Going for a walk in the park, outdoors, far apart from others, in a wide open area. Unsafe and nonessential.

        <p>Yes, getting groceries is more essential than going for a leisurely walk. I don’t get what point it is you’re trying to make here. You can’t compare a recreational activity to going grocery shopping. Apples and oranges.</p>

        <p>You can definitely compare a recreational activity to going grocery shopping...People were going to the grocery just to get out of the house in the Spring. So going to the supermarket to get makeup is acceptable in your eyes but getting fresh air and vitamin d sunlight is not? Haven't there been studies that vitamin D helps fight COVID and reduce the severity? If you don't think recreational activity is essential you are delusional and should not be spouting off whack opinions that are detrimental to your own and others health.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t matter if it <em>can</em> be a recreational activity. That’s such a stretch. Anything can be a recreational activity. The point is, grocery shopping is an essential act, regardless of whether or not some people do it for recreational purposes. Going to the park is not an essential act. You can sit on your porch or take supplements to get sufficient vitamin D (and you can get these at the store :) )</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure asserting that grocery shopping is a recreational activity is a little bit more of a “whack opinion” lol. That’s such a silly assertion. That’s like saying that working any job that you enjoy is a recreational activity. Anything can be done for recreational purposes. Just because they can be done recreationally doesn’t make the acts themselves inherently recreational.</p>

        <p>I mean I get you and some of them love it because they can be drunk with power over people. </p>
<p>But in Canada, this happened:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/PoliceOnGuard</p>
<p>Because of a police officer who saw the video of the kid being arrested for playing ice hockey outside and the officer said he will no longer defend the mandates anymore, but instead the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Canadian Constitution):</p>
<p><em>"Citizens of Ontario, Ontario’s Chiefs of Police,
Police Associations, Premier of Ontario,
Ministry of the Attorney General,
Ministry of the Solicitor General,
Municipal Politicians, Public Health Officials</em></p>
<p><em>21st December 2020</em></p>
<p><em>I am a Police Officer and know many other officers that support the following message.</em></p>
<p><em>After the unfortunate events in Calgary, the time for action is now. I have serious concerns over Premier Ford’s decision to expand further restrictions that put law enforcement officers in an untenable situation that must be avoided.</em></p>
<p><em>For 10 months public officials and bureaucrats have been operating with arbitrary emergency powers that often violate the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Everyday Premier Ford, Mayor Tory, and politically appointed bureaucrats are on television, radio, and in the newspapers, calling on Ontarians to slowly allow all civil liberties to be taken away.</em></p>
<p><em>What I have seldom seen is any comment by those in positions of Law Enforcement and the Judicial System addressing the lawfulness of these measures, or on the grave consequences they create.</em></p>
<p><em>I am calling on the following stakeholders to immediately meet independently from Politicians and Bureaucrats: The Ontario Chiefs of Police, Police Associations, members of the Ministry of the Attorney General including Crown Attorneys, Judges, Justices of the Peace, and Constitutional lawyers.</em></p>
<p><em>Please collaborate and deliver clear and concise direction to the men and women in Law Enforcement. Until this happens, a moratorium needs to be declared on the enforcement of public health orders by peace officers. 10 months has been far too long for this not to have happened.</em></p>
<p><em>Are police officers supposed to uphold the Charter which they have taken an oath to protect? Or do Municipal By Laws now supersede the Constitution?</em></p>
<p><em>At a time when the public trust in police has nearly eroded beyond repair this is of paramount importance. The citizens of Ontario deserve transparency from the officials they have elected, as well as from the police that are sworn to serve and protect. This is not an unreasonable request.</em></p>
<p><em>What happened in Calgary cannot happen again. Never in my life did I think I would see police officers threatening to taser and arrest kids playing pond hockey.</em></p>
<p><em>Signed
Police on Guard for Thee
Will you stand?"</em></p>
<p>Please don't paint everyone under one broad stroke because then we leave people out like this who are fighting <em>with us</em> to <em>protect us</em>. </p>
<p>There's many instances of police doing this in the US as well.</p>

<p>By and large, Canadians are much more compliant than Americans so yes you can the CCLa has documented these atrocities though you can find their report here  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14MKc0Z06YXOLbal5WFAAl65KGofFDgGn/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/14MKc0Z06YXOLbal5WFAAl65KGofFDgGn/view?usp=sharing</a> </p>
<p>Canadians don't have free speech self-expression can be limited.... and we don't have the 5th amendment, all of this plus socialism and a Nanny state's death grip on power means that Canadians virtually have no power even our political system which is inherently democratic has serious flaws...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU_CuvSOupU&amp;ab_channel=J.J.McCullough">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU_CuvSOupU&amp;ab_channel=J.J.McCullough</a> </p>
<p>Furthermore, for a country of only 40 million people, we have an immense percentage of the world's resources mainly freshwater.</p>

<p>This is very interesting detailing the Missionaries we sent to china that had children that came back and brought along Chinese ideals with them into our political system this in part with many different things explains why Canada is like it is today... </p>
<p>Having said all of that and having real hate for the OPP and how they are used as revenue collectors(this is what I do when I see em speed trapping near me) <a href="https://pastebin.com/jKATdTk3">https://pastebin.com/jKATdTk3</a></p>
<p>Even after all of that dissent and crime(ATV stuff technically) In the name of civil disobedience against the OPP I still think this is a step in the right direction for the OPP I would rather see them do this than continue to ignore it all and just comply even if they have made immense mistakes for 9+ months</p>

        <p>Oh are they just doing their job? That’s totally fine then right? </p>
<p>Fuck that bullshit. Go watch them take a knee while BLM destroy shit then watch them beat old women round the head for asking for freedom.</p>
<p>Fuck the police. They don’t work for you. Get a different job if you are in the police, we all have a choice.</p>
<p>Once more for good luck: fuck the police. Anyone who is happy with harassing law abiding citizens on their way to work for not wearing some pointless cloth are scum. The revolution is coming and I’d happily cave some copper skulls in after seeing how much they enjoy beating women and intimidating people. Fuck them.</p>

        <p>They have an obligation to protect the public and not enforce obviously illegal and draconian laws. Just doing their job is how Germany succeeded in killing millions of Jews.   Police must also be held accountable for the damage they are inflicting on their communities</p>

        <p>&rt;They have an obligation to protect the public</p>
<p>Unfortunately this isn't entirely true. Look into Warren v District of Columbia. Police provide a protective and law enforcement service to society at large, but have no obligation to any individual person. Sadly, this could more easily be used as justification to <em>enforce</em> lockdowns, not ignore them.</p>
<p>From the case:</p>
<p>&rt;the duty to provide public services is owed to the public at large, and, absent a special relationship between the police and an individual, no specific legal duty exists</p>
<p>This was after a case where two men broke into a boarding house and raped and assaulted a woman. The neighbors called police, who showed up, knocked on the door, then left within 5 minutes of their arrival. The neighbors called the police again, who didn't return. The neighbors (two women) called for help which alerted the intruders to their presence, and all 3 women in the house were kidnapped and raped/assaulted for 14 hours.</p>
<p>They brought negligence charges because the dispatcher did not relay the call as code 1 (crime in progress), the officers failed to adequately investigate the scene, and the dispatcher never dispatched the second call.</p>
<p>The court pretty much said "tough." Police have no obligation to perform their job in an individual instance, only in the general sense that they exist.</p>
<p>You'll hear this from cops sometimes - "my first priority is to make it home to my family every night." They have no obligation to you, they only respect your rights insofar as violating them could get evidence or a whole criminal case thrown out, and as such they are far from the heroes they are made out to be.</p>

        <p>I'm not a fan of the police, that's for sure, but I've got to give credit where it's due: There have been several stories about police departments who have refused to enforce the lockdown, and I'm sure some individual cops choose to look the other way too. But the ones that choose to hassle people for utterly stupid reasons (e.g. being alone on a beach) are just as guilty as the people making the rules.</p>

<p>Why do the supermarkets have that little guard tower looking but over the entrances looking over an enclosed building? </p>
<p>..seems far fetched even for me, but honestly the way things are going and how meticulously everything is planned, I wouldn’t be surprised if the infrastructure for the 1894 NWO isn’t actually already here under our noses and we will give them “permission” to use it on us eventually.</p>

        <p>The beach is just about the safest place you could be, unless everyone is holding hands or touching each other. Even a busy beach still has space between people. Regardless, people should be free to go to the beach if they want to. If you think it’s unsafe then you can stay home.</p>

        <p>Home is about the safest place you could be.</p>
<p>The goal is to keep people physically apart. The beach is better than being inside. Still doesn’t make it a good place to be and it’s by no means a necessity. </p>
<p>If the virus only affected those who ignored precautions than you and I would be on the same page. However it affects everyone even those who are trying their best to stay home. If drunk driving only killed the driver I would care very little about the issue. However since it doesn’t just kill the driver as a society we must take measures to curve (eliminate) that behavior.</p>

        <p>I guess it wasn't too hard for you to dumb human psyche down to obtaining bliss merely by consuming, either. Spending time <em>by yourself</em> in a vast expanse such as a beach, being in the nature, breathing fresh air and contemplating with the tide of the sea and ranges of colors in the bottomless sky before you is <strong>essential</strong> as well. See, that has been the problem. We're interfering with the choices and banning them, because we think they are not essential. There'll always be essential concepts for other souls which are outside the perception of power.</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting in a thread where everyone disagrees with you, I , know how hard that is.</p>
<p>My question for you, is how do we determine when we beat the virus? What metric would make someone like you feel like the beach would be safe again?</p>
<p>This is what scares me, everyone is saying to “trust the science” but to what degreee? To what metric? If we can’t even agree when this will be over, there’s too much over reach in power</p>

        <p>When people say 'trust the science' they mean the science that confirms their beliefs.  That are not interested in science who challenge their belief system and fail to realise that science is ever evolving and open to debate.  It is not a consensus that has to be left unchallenged.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Like the hundred years of mask science proving they don't work, and 4 months of science this year evolving to say they do and the last 100 years of science is wrong. #BelieveInScience !!!</p>
