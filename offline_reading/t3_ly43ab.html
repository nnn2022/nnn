    <strong>A message to visitors to this subreddit...</strong>
    <p><p><strong>DO NOT BELIEVE THE LIES PROPAGATED BY THOSE WHO ARE OUT TO CENSOR US</strong></p>
<p>There is a coordinated attempt to portray this subreddit as a hate speech / anti-Semitic forum which a part of a strategy concocted by people related to the subreddit <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/lty2l9/rnonewnormal_is_a_misinformation_sub_entirely/">"Against hate subbreddits"</a>.  They have fabricated a narrative that our subreddit promotes anti-Semitism or white supremacy and other such nonsense then ever since that post was made, an army of trolls has been posting from accounts posing as members of NoNewNormal but using terrible user names such as "KillingJewsGivesJoy".</p>
<p>These are not genuine users since all of the actual users want to do everything possible to keep the subreddit up.  The actual users are bending over backwards and even changing moving to different usernames that could even be misconstrued as being offensive.</p>
<p>To the people responsible for creating these hate speech accounts, you should be ashamed that you are literally spreading hate speech in an effort to censor ideas that you don't like.  The fact that you are even conflating such a thing as being against lockdowns and masks as "hate speech" is truly detrimental to the actual virtuous cause of fighting against hate. </p>
<p>I have been told that this is a playbook that has been used to take down other subreddits that people didn't agree with and I wasn't apart of those so I don't know if they are worth defending but I do know this one and that it is not anything close to the false claims being used to defame us.</p></p>
