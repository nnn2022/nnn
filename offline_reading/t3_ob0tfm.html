        <p>'I do not want under 40s getting AstraZeneca,' Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young reiterated. </p>
<p>'It is rare, but they are at increased risk of getting the rare clotting syndrome. We've seen up to 49 deaths in the UK from that syndrome. </p>
<p>'I don't want an 18-year-old in Queensland dying from a clotting illness who, if they got Covid, probably wouldn't die.'   </p>
<p>Earlier, Queensland announced three new cases on the first day of its snap three-day lockdown affecting 3.5million people but in an extraordinary press conference, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk quickly turned to attacking the Morrison government's new recommendations for AstraZeneca and people under the age of 40.</p>
<p>'There has been no national cabinet decision about providing AstraZeneca to the under 40s,' the Premier said. </p>
<p>'My message to Queenslanders today is please listen to Dr Young and listen to the health experts when it comes to the vaccine. </p>
<p>'At the moment, the advice is for people aged 40 to 59 to get Pfizer, and people 60 and over to get AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>'There has been no national cabinet decision about AstraZeneca being given to under 40s.' </p>
<p>Ms Palaszczuk cited a BBC report from the UK that under 40s would be offered alternatives to the AstraZeneca vaccine because of clotting fears.   </p>
<p>'I do not want under 40s getting AstraZeneca,' Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young reiterated. </p>
<p>'It is rare, but they are at increased risk of getting the rare clotting syndrome. We've seen up to 49 deaths in the UK from that syndrome. </p>
<p>'I don't want an 18-year-old in Queensland dying from a clotting illness who, if they got Covid, probably wouldn't die.'   </p>
<p>'National cabinet said that there was an indemnity for doctors,' Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>
<p>'So, that is very clear that national cabinet did not make that decision. I'd like to ask the prime minister, did his cabinet make that decision?'  </p>
<p>In early June Ms Palaszczuk, 51, received the Pfizer vaccine despite advice at the time that over 50s should receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>
<p>She cited her need to attend the Tokyo Olympics as part of Brisbane's bid for the Games in 2032 as the reason for waiting for the Pfizer dose. The AstraZeneca vaccine requires 12 weeks between doses, as opposed to Pfizer's 21-day top up.</p>
<p>Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the prime minister's revised AstraZeneca advice for those under 40 put Queenslanders 'at risk'.  </p>
<p>'There is some discussion that the Commonwealth might even provide their own vaccination hubs so that they can get AstraZeneca vaccines out to younger people despite that vaccine not being recommended,' he said.</p>
<p>'That would be very risky.' </p>
<p>NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was asked about her Queensland counterpart's comments during her daily Covid update.</p>
<p>'Can I just make the point that the New South Wales Government always follows the health advice and the health advice from the federal regulatory bodies is that those over 60 should be getting AstraZeneca,' she said. </p>
<p>'We will accept anybody over 60 who wants AstraZeneca and accept anybody getting their second shot, but beyond that, you should talk to your GP.'   </p>
