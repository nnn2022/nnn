    <strong>No "New Normal" During Or After The Spanish Flu of 1918</strong>
    <p><p>So why should now be any different? Fucking WHY do we have to change the way we live our lives for a poxy fucking meme virus that in comparison to the Spanish flu has barely had an impact on the majority of the population? 500 million people were infected during the Spanish flu over a two year period whilst cOvID-19 has infected 150 million in a year, and that's not even getting into the flawed PCR tests and false positives. It has A LOT of catching up to do if it hopes to be anywhere near as fucking bad as the 1918 pandemic.</p>
<p>As for deaths, the current total of coronavirus deaths are at 3.15 million worldwide, and as we all know that number is dubious at best given all the incompetence and general butt-fuckery going on behind the scenes. As for the Spanish flu death total? It's estimated to be somewhere between 20 and 50 million, with the highest estimates being 100 MILLION. Holy SHIT. All of that JUST AFTER coming out of a World War, as well. We have it fucking EASY, so stop acting like you're a virtuous badass cause you sat at home wearing a face-diaper whilst watching Netflix.</p>
<p>All of that and yet we didn't fucking stagger out of that demanding a "new normal". Our governments and scientists didn't come to the insane conclusion that face-masks should become a permanent fixture of society. People went on with their lives. Do you wanna fucking know why? BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HAD SOME FUCKING BALLS BACK THEN. That and not everyone was a narcissistic, virtue-signaling shit-head posturing for fucking clout. Taking a vaccine-selfie back then would have required them to stand in front of an old-timey camera for fucking ages with the needle hanging limply out their arm, waiting for the flash to go off.</p>
<p>So stop advocating for vaccine passports and mandatory vaccinations. Stop normalizing social distancing and face-masks. Stop saying "tHiNgs dEfInItElY cAnT gO bAcK tO hOw tHeY wERe" and demanding a permanent new normal. If the world could get back to normal in 1920, it can do it again in 2021. There is NO GOOD REASON it can't.</p></p>

        <p>There's a consensus that the face masks in the Spanish flu didn't work.</p>
<p>However, it's claimed by "experts" that this was just because the masks a century ago were shoddy, and that the masks we're wearing now work.</p>

        <p>From Wikipedia:  In contrast, a 2007 analysis of medical journals from the period of the pandemic found that the viral infection was no more aggressive than previous influenza strains. Instead, malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, and poor hygiene, all exacerbated by the recent war, promoted bacterial superinfection.  </p>
<p>I'm willing to bet the masks are partially responsible for that.</p>

        <p>If you pick up a box of your average grocery-store masks it says right on the box "these are not able to prevent the spread of transmittable diseases". Maybe KN95s work, but most Americans are able to spread the virus just as easily as if they weren't wearing a mask</p>

        <p>You're getting it now! It’s because it was never about a virus. It was to cover up the global financial system collapse and to bring in a new world order.</p>

        <p>Not to mention the global population was much smaller back then, so an even higher proportion of people succumbed to that disease.</p>
<p>We’ve dug up people who died of Spanish Flu and analyzed the remnants of the viral particles in them. What we found is that variants did not contribute towards that pandemic. Why didn’t any highly infectious variant get a foothold? Because people back then didn’t go into lockdown or use leaky vaccines.</p>
<p>Our current, massive intervention in the natural course of a pandemic is unprecedented. An experiment, if you will.</p>
