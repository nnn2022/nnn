    <strong>It's sad seeing people almost brag about how they were depressed shut-ins for months</strong>
    <p><p>Alberta partially opened up today so my Instagram feed is slowly becoming littered with posts of "first time at X in Y months!"</p>
<p>I actually find this quite sad. My friends and I never stopped seeing each other on a weekly basis, we were just creative about it. Didn't advertise it all over social media and parked down the street so there wouldn't be a crowd of cars in front of someone's house. Establishments were closed but we made our own fun. Lots of aimlessly cruising around or drunken walks around the neighborhood. </p>
<p>I genuinely can't believe the sheer volume of people who unironically sat at home doing nothing for double the length of a summer holiday, simply because the TV told them to. </p>
<p>It's like these people willingly became depressed pieces of shit, just so they could advertise they followed all the rules for little hearts on their tweets. It never occurred to them that there is no actual benefit to doing so, and that twitter and facebook are not real life, and tiny dopamine hits from strangers doesn't actually matter. </p>
<p>You are advertising that you wasted four months of your life for a social activism campaign that in a few months time will be seen as cringey and wasteful, just like Kony2012 and BlackLivesMatter was. It's bizarre.</p></p>

        <p>Can they take their religion somewhere else? At this point I‚Äôm almost tempted to just carve out a new country made out of Washington and Western Canada for hardcore COVID koolaid drinkers. Not like your average mild lockdown supporter but I mean the CNN addicted borderline religious fanatics who unironically would have us wearing masks and social distancing for a year, two, decade, forever, etc. They can have their little Church of COVID Theocracy called Doomerland or Maskia or Sheepland whatever and Fauci can be their god emperor with total dictatorial authority to lock everything down as long as they want. The beat part is they won‚Äôt have to worry about us ‚ÄúCOVIDIOTS‚Äù coming in and giving it to them cause lets be honest-we won‚Äôt wanna be within two states of that hellhole.</p>
