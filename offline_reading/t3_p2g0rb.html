    <strong>Vaccine side effects: brain blood clot</strong>
    <p><p>My father is 78 years old. He got his second shot of Pfizer in april. Exactly two weeks later, he suffered three attacks in 48 hours caused by brain clots,  and spent 5 days in the hospital.</p>
<p>He has mostly recovered now, he's quite strong for his age, and had no problems whatsoever of this kind before.</p>
<p>You know what's most shocking to me ? When I went to visit him at the hospital, I talked to the doctor who has taking care of him. I asked him if the blood clots could be related to the vaccine. The good doctor shrugged it off and told me that it could not under any circumstances be caused by the vaccine.</p>
<p>So of course this was never counted as a possible side effect, and I'm sure that there are many such cases. It's obvious that if you don't look out for them, there will be no side effects at all.</p>
<p>My country has no VAERS system, so it will never be counted. As for myself, there's no way I'll get the jab.</p></p>
