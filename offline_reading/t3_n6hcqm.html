    <strong>LoOk WhAt HaPpEnEd In InDiA</strong>
    <p><p>I decided to post a comment I made in the weekly thread as a separate thread here. I edited it slightly and added a few more points below.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Every country reached a peak at some point.</p>
<p>First it was China. Then Iran. Then Italy. Then New York. Then the UK. Then France and Belgium. Then Sweden. Fast forward a few months and all the media talked about was Brazil. And now India seems to be the popular topic.</p>
<p>Think about India for a moment. Think of all the random things you can remember about this country. The food, the clothes, the way they <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/12/world/asia/india-funeral-pyres-emissions/index.html">burn their dead</a>. The caste system. The horrible inequality between the rich and the poor as well as between genders. The slums. The poverty. The memes from a couple of  years ago, mocking them for their lack of toilets. Half of their population <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/05/asia/india-modi-open-defecation-free-intl-hnk-scli/index.html">doesn't have access</a> to toilets. And that's a huge health hazard. Lack of toilet means lack of shower, a sink to wash your clothes and dirty dishes, basically anything that requires fresh running water and a sewage system.</p>
<p>Think some more. The underpaid garment workers working for a few dollars per day. The people  working in brick kilns who are basically <a href="http://www.antislavery.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Slavery-In-Indias-Brick-Kilns-The-Payment-System.pdf">modern slaves</a>. The farmers that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHpZV7ro7lU">protested</a> only a couple of months ago, but apart from Greta Thunberg posting a drafted, scripted <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/02/04/greta-thunberg-faces-probe-in-india-over-farm-protest-tweets/">tweet</a> about the topic, not many people paid attention.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Indian_farmers%27_protest">protests</a> started in August and in November-December they were gaining a lot of traction. But still, they didn't cause a covid spike. I wonder why?</p>
<p>Diarrhea <a href="https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/digestive/intestines/diarrhoea">kills hundreds of thousands of kids under the age of 5 in India every year</a>.</p>
<p>But nobody cared. No one.</p>
<p>Someone could've nuked India and the media would've paid less attention than they do now, with their CoViD cRiSiS.</p>
<p>What about child mortality? In India there are 39 deaths for every 1000 births. In America it's 7 per 1000. Quite a difference, right?</p>
<p>Don't you think it feels hypocritical, fake and scripted, like Greta Thunberg's tweet? The media wants you to pay attention to the covid crisis in India but they didn't care as much before. Almost no one in the west cared. Just a developing country with a bunch of problems. We only care when it suits our agenda.</p>
<p>If you look at India's covid case and morality rate you'll realize it's not much different from any other country that peaked at a certain moment in time. Except for Australia and NZ of course, but it's an entirely different story over there.</p>
<p>The crisis in India will soon pass (or decline) and the media will conveniently forget about the country's existence and all of the other problems its people have. Then they'll move on to the next developing country they could exploit for clicks, like vultures. It's all fake. I'm not saying that the deaths are fake, I'm saying that the threat is exaggerated and it feels hypocritical. And lacks context.</p>
<p>Look at the mortality rate around the world and make your own conclusions. Right now Hungary seems to be hit the worst but no one talks about it, probably because they masked up and vaccinated. Their deaths per million are reaching 3k. For reference, America's deaths per million are 1,782. Look at the population size of India. Almost 1.4 billion. That means that every 5th (almost) person on this planet is Indian. Compare them to their neighbours - Pakistan. What are they doing different? Why isn't anyone investigating it?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Don't rely on the TV to give you ready-made opinions. And remember, next time the media is spending a lot of time on a certain country or even a certain superspreader event, write down the date. Then follow up a couple of weeks later. Compare the outcomes. There was supposed to be an apocalypse in Sweden. Now their mortality rate is not much different from Greece's, where people need to send a text message in order to be allowed outside. Was it worth it?</p>
<p>What about Brazil and their baby eating, grandma murdering, far right leader? Well, their death rate is not much different from Peru's and Peru locked down hard. You're probably gonna say 'these poorer countries can't lock down properly so it doesn't count'. Well, exactly. Lockdowns could only work in wealthy countries and they only benefit wealthy people. The poor still need to make money. Or they'll starve.</p>
<p>Superspreader events in Florida and Texas? Follow up please. Show me the spike. Huge protest in London almost 2 week ago. Again, where's the spike? How many grandmas died? </p>
<p>Now, what about variants? The British variant, the South African variant, the French variant, the Nigerian variant, the Brazilian variant, the New York variant. I believe at least 2 of these were 'mostly killing young people' and one of them 'was undetectable by PCR testing'. There was a double, triple or quadruple mutant among them as well. Did anything change? Did anyone really follow up on these stories? Does anyone still care anymore?</p>
<p>Try not to have the memory of a goldfish.</p></p>

        <p>They want me to look at India? Okay, I’m seeing a huge spike in cases as soon as the vaccines began to rollout. What conclusion should I make with that information? </p>
<p>Great post by the way. India is a TERRIBLE example for covid-fear mongering, for a plethora of reasons.</p>

        <p>on my phone so cant copy this down but anyone with a desktop, copy this and message it to me.  this is so fucking well put and completely nails how i see it as well.   its all dizzying, and so sad to see how the people are being yanked around by an unholy alliance of hegemony aligned science, news and politicians, acting in ultimately ways that will benefit the hegemonic powers at the national and international levels.  </p>
<p>to me the full court mono-narrative in most major news and dominant american left wing, which acts like its the little guy but has pretty much become the new language and culture of the current flavor of global state and technocracy enhancing power.</p>

        <p>I love how in these statistics, they never show total population. How there are so many more deaths happening in India, but don’t even acknowledge that they are a country of over 1.4 billion.</p>
