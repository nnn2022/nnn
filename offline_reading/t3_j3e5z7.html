    <strong>Thank you NoNewNormal for helping us stay sane!</strong>
    <p><p>Just taking a moment to thank the mods of this sub for providing us with a space to express ourselves with thoughtfulness and common sense, and for going to great lengths to protect us from the irritating attempts of doomers to disrupt and sabotage a free space to share frustrations and dissatisfaction with a lot of the idiocy we're seeing in the world right now. If it weren't for subs like this, I probably would have ended up in the looney bin by now. It really helps to know there are many others out there who don't just believe whatever CNN tells them. It's refreshing to hear from others who know how to think for themselves, interpret facts of figures and make up their own minds rather than blindly following what political hacks who run health departments tell them they should think. So ... thank you from the bottom of my heart. Because of subs like this, I can breathe comfortably (pun intended) when I go to bed at night knowing I am not living in the Twighlight Zone.</p></p>

        <p>I agree and thank you to the moderators.  And all contributors.  </p>
<p>The fact that so many are so angry and so triggered that anyone dares to disagree with mask/Covid groupthink is pretty telling.   I‚Äôm hopeful that we will ease back into ‚Äúnormal‚Äù at some point.  I‚Äôm hopeful reading about Sweden and states like Florida and Georgia and South Dakota where weird Doomers were gleefully predicting mass deaths from Covid.   Ditto anyplace that reopened schools. Or restaurants.   </p>
<p>The fact that their predictions have not come true doesn‚Äôt deter them from predicting the apocalypse.  There‚Äôs a yahoo on another sub right now angrily insisting that ‚ÄúNewsweek‚Äù is a better authority on masks then peer-reviewed studies.  How can anyone rationally address that?  </p>
<p>In any event I‚Äôm so happy I found this subreddit.   Having said that:  I am going to delete my account.  Once again I‚Äôm dealing with a troll who has threatened to rape me (and my kids üò≥) in private messaging.   I previously reported the sick bastard but it appears he‚Äôs back.  </p>
<p>I guess provoking that kind of irrational anger must mean we‚Äôre on to something.   But I need to leave Reddit.  </p>
<p>I wish you all well and here‚Äôs hoping there will be a return to our old normal.   ‚úåüèª</p>

        <p>Yeah, that situation is fucking awful, isn't it?</p>
<p>I've got a couple of friends from college I keep in touch with who see through the bullshit, but most everyone else in my life? They've been completely brainwashed by the "experts" like Fraudci to be terrified of their own shadows. </p>
<p>That is, when they don't openly look forward to and embrace the new abnormal dystopia.</p>

        <p>It's been sad for me to see other "educated" people falling for the MSM party lines, even as they swing wildly from one arbitrary order to another.</p>

        <p>u/SpiderImAlright et all are practicing what they preach here. They allow open discussion among reasonable people with minimal interference. Which, in essence, is what we're asking for in real life - the ability to make our own decisions as we see best, trusting that most people are good in nature and not interested in harming their neighbor and certainly not all criminals that are guilty until proven innocent. If all governments and health officials treated us with as much respect and good faith as the mods do in this sub, the world would be a much better, less divisive place. Thanks guys.</p>
