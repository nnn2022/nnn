        <p>Not judging but the mom looks like a smoker, so couldn't have help. I could be wrong but the kid could have had a much more active childhood, I grew up in the late 80s and 90s so you could not find us as we were out bike riding or playing manhunt or in the woods. Only rule was be home or friends by sundown. Kids now play vidya all day and covid makes them even more isolated. Idiocracy was not a movie but a documentary.</p>

        <p>My dad is in his mid 60s and was telling me how back when he was in grade school, there was maybe the one fat kid in your class. A few in your grade. But the vast majority of kids were scrawny and/or healthy weights.</p>
<p>Now, half of a kindergarten class is comprised of fat children. You look at kids at restaurants or malls and they’re all chunky. It’s pretty wild what American diets have done in recent decades. And lack of exercise / play time outdoors.</p>

        <p>I mean... Health and obesity was a known risk. Maybe they should have encouraged their kids to be healthy. </p>
<p>Instead of blaming her health on something that statistically shouldn't be a risk for a 13 year old.</p>
<p>As a person, it sucks to see a child going through something like this. But... This was all known.</p>

        <p>Absolutely agree, everyone knew the risks and yet didn’t really seem to make any attempt to correct it.   It’s sad to see anyone suffer, kids more so than anything but you have to wonder.    I try not to judge as I myself am supposedly “severely obese” per medical standards and I’ve not made any major lifestyle changes.</p>

        <p>My first post on Reddit period, just been hanging out and reading here.   I remain on the fence about the vaccine for myself, 99% of my family has refused it.  I’m a fire chief and I drive bus loads of people up and down the river for a local canoe outfitter and have been doing so since the pandemic started.  I have moments that my anxiety takes over and tells me to take it, then i have moments where I think it’s all stupid.    That idea aside, some of these things just really leave me scratching my head, would they really allow her in there with no mask, would they really allow the crews and cameras in there?</p>

        <p>Enter your stats and preexisting conditions into an online covid calculator. I also struggle from health anxiety and sometimes the fearmongering gets to me. Then a calculator (made from the a top university) reminded me that that I have a 0.0002% chance of dying from covid and a 0.01% chance of being hospitalized. If I’m the unluckiest dude in the world and that happens, then maybe I’ll buy a lottery ticket and karma will balance me out lol. Definitely the reward of potentially lowering that % does not seem worth the risk of the vaccine to me.</p>
<p>Or if you find out you’re at a significantly greater risk than me based on age, weight, and health history, maybe you’ll decide taking the vaccine is right for you. Either way good to know so you can do the risk/benefit analysis that suits you.</p>

        <p>I’ve played around with a couple of these calculators.  Death risk falls below 0.1, 0.000009 per the JH calculator (if I figured right) I haven’t found a really good hospitalization risk calculator but the one I did find seems to think 12.6 based on those factors.   31, 6’3” and 325lbs with controlled hypertension.</p>

        <p>Gotcha. I’ll a little younger and a little shorter (sad lol) than you without those pre-existing risk factors (asthma only), so can’t advise what id so in your position. My whole family has gotten the vaccine with no major short term issues. Obviously praying for no long term as well although who knows with any of this stuff.</p>
<p>Think the truth despite the fearmongering on both sides is you’ll likely be fine either way, there are certainly risks associated with either choice, and you’ve got to do the best you can to be confident with your decision and not let anxiety get to you. Reassess every few months based on new info if you decide not to get it. Set timeframes for when you’re going to reassess and outside those timeframes don’t allow yourself to worry cause that won’t help anything. Obviously not a doctor and this isn’t official medical advice but that’s what I’m thinkin</p>

        <p>I'm unsure of whether these vaccines are a death sentence.  I have more a problem with the level of coercion, lack of informed consent, and as illustrated by this case - not giving people the appropriate information free of fear mongering about the risk of covid given your situation and the risk of the vaccine.  Are you morbidly obese and have chronic healthcare conditions resulting from being morbidly obese?  Well, considering that 80%+ of hospitalizations were in obese people, you may want to consider risking the possible side effects of the vaccine and get your formidable self vaccinated.  Are you the parent of a healthy young child for whom covid has been little risk over the last 18 months?  You probably don't need to take the risk of vaccination and having them suffer heart inflammation.  </p>
<p>Risk versus benefit analysis.  They're not allowing or encouraging people to do this.</p>

<p>This would require critical thinking, something they've been against this whole pandemic.

        <p>Not a bad outlook. Back in Dec. 2019 at my former employer’s distribution center, around 90% of our workforce got varying degrees of what we thought was a cold or stomach flu (myself included). A few people stayed home for a day or two and then everything went back to normal. As soon as Covid became a thing and blood centers were running tests, I found out I had the anti-bodies. It’s obviously a real thing, but not worth destroying our economy over.</p>
