    <strong>There’s no way someone can prove a non mask wearer is responsible for someone getting Covid and dying unless:</strong>
    <p><p>They can prove that the Non masker was infected with Covid at the point of contact AND that the person that was infected with COVID was not infected with COVID until coming into contact with non masker. And even if that was the case you can’t call it “Murder” if the person didn’t even know they were a carrier.</p>
<p>Crazy how with the flu and other viruses no one ever cared or considered that someone else was responsible for them getting sick. We accepted that it was risk of living. Now potentially spreading Covid to someone else is considered “murder” even if you had no idea because we’re supposed to act on the premise that we all are infected with COVID19 24/7/365 no matter what.</p>
<p>FWIW I’ll wear a mask if mandated by a business but I’m not tripping out about someone not wearing a mask. Even if I got sick how I could I even prove that the “Non Masker” is who gave It to me. Unless I am getting tested every day?</p></p>

        <p>The fact that you won’t even know you have the virus until you get tested is enough for me to call bullshit on my ability to kill someone with it. </p>
<p>If it’s so deadly, wouldn’t I know I had it? We never needed to set up testing sites for people to recognize they had the Bubonic plague or the Spanish Flu.</p>

        <p>Actually not true on the Spanish Flu. Historically there were a hell of a lot of asymptomatic spreaders during that pandemic which they documented after the pandemic was over.</p>

        <p>Actually they attributed it to mostly people who were vaccinated. Asymptomatic transmission has always been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDFsWybjkmg">rare</a> . Mask wearing also contributed to weakened immune systems that also exacerbated the pandemic. Fauci actually wrote a piece on that actually.</p>

        <p>I hear it was 11,000, but that doesn't matter- if we use 11,000 against the entire population in the US, that's only 0.0035% of the population that's died from this virus this year.   I like those odds.  That means that 99.9964% survived it (or died of something else entirely).</p>

        <p>People should be held responsible for spreading disease, however, 99% of time people who don't wear masks or who hold social gatherings or whatever insane infringement of our rights is flavor of the week, are not actually spreading disease because they don't actually have CoVid.  It is classic victimless crime.   You should not be held liable for not wearing a mask, but you should be held liable if you spread disease to someone, and it doesn't matter if you were wearing a mask or not.</p>

        <p>They would also have to prove that cloth masks are effective against airborne transmission which has been a stout "NO" for the last hundred years.  All the talk about "water droplets" is bullshit as is the talk about coughing and sneezing because hardly anyone in public is showing symptoms.  If the two people aren't coughing or sneezing then it comes down to simply airborne transmission which has never been proven to be affected by masks.</p>

        <p>People talk about masks like wearing one makes them immune. It's just an extension of that. In their mind, if everyone is wearing a mask there is no way for the disease to spread, thus it must be the guy without the masks' fault.</p>
<p>I believe that most people are smart enough to not actually believe that, but given the messaging around masks I see why they have that knee jerk reaction.</p>
