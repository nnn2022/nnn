        <p>There was at least one teacher in Sweden who literally got fired for wearing a mask. I think they got hired back a few days later, but it shows how different their attitudes towards COVID are.</p>

        <p>Covid has basically been over here since the beginning of february.  </p>
<p>Overall deaths in Sweden have been way below baseline since 1 february and as it looks like now the overall deaths in 2021 will be well below the 2015-2019 average. </p>
<p>What does that mean? Well, that instead of torturing 10 million people with lockdowns, masks and other stupid rules it might have led to a few very old and sick people dying a little earlier than they otherwise would have.</p>
<p>I know it sounds harsh but sacrificing 18 months of our childrens lives vs sacrificing a few months in the tail end of a 90 year olds life, yeah I think the answer is obvious.</p>
<p>And don't forget that 2019 had record low deaths in Sweden. So we can only assume that there was a build up of old frail people that usually would have died in a normal respiratory season and since there was none in 2019 they died in numbers in 2020.</p>

        <p>Well, depending on how you look at it. Like I said, sacrificing 18 months of EVERY life in the country or a few months of the end of the life of very few elderly.</p>
<p>And don't forget, there is more to success in public health measures and politcal actions than measuring covid deaths.  This nonsense is gonna bite governments all over the world in the ass and has already started in some places.</p>
<p>I am at least very satisfied and I think most Swedes are. Not a single mask outside of my workplace(which is a hospital) since this nonsense started.</p>

        <p>A different take for sure. You’re argument, to put it bluntly, would be that suffering and death due to covid in older people is less important than everyone having to social distance and wear a mask in public. We didn’t technically ‘lose’ 18 months of our lives in my country, but we lost some first world luxury such as dining out; people’s business got screwed too. We also have a debatably poor healthcare system that some regional health centers’ overflow with covid cases. In the beginning it was a shitshow with business lockdowns and some states took them wayyyy too far though. Also, we got hit relatively early and had no testing as cases spread. Of course, there’s also the morbidly component of people of all ages getting ill but not passing and unknowns as to wether or not covid has long term consequences(it appears to in a meaningful percent of people). </p>
<p>The biggest impact non-morbid impact in the USA, IMO of course, was that we had remote learning for students in many places. The internet says Sweden had some education changes like that, is that false?</p>

        <p>All children under 16 years old went to school like normal. Older than 16 had to study from home.</p>
<p>But it sounds like you live in the US. 
With all those restrictions, almst every state in the US faired worse than Sweden. 
It seems that when the virus is widespread in any country, most restriction do very little, including masks. 
The virus has been widespread all over Sweden but hasn't yet spread in the other Nordics. 
The question now is wether the other nordics have just postponed the problem or if the vaccine is effective. I guess we will see in the winter, if they ever open up that is.</p>

        <p>Yeah that was the logic. Prevent morbidity and mortality until the vax Oran effective therapy is available. Stay at home orders don’t help much it seems unless you want to keep them in place literally the entire time. They blunted the waves but they’re not sustainable really. Plus, we have places like Miami and NY where people are packed in pretty tight.</p>
<p>Edit-I’m might be wrong but I envision swedes as being way more self responsible with respecting the virus and staying at a reasonable distance as compared to some the flat out covid deniers we have in America</p>

        <p>True. What are people gonna do with themselves in 10-20 years when the 80+ population has increased significantly and deaths(from all causes) will be sky high compared to today. </p>
<p>Many people don't get that there have never been as many very old and very sick people alive like there is right now.  We have to take that into account when comparing this virus to previous pandemics.</p>

        <p>Yes. Much like Canada ignored Florida, Texas and Arizona as examples to study whether 'opening up regardless of case counts' could work - the rest of the world is also ignoring Sweden's example and instead going ahead with their own narrative.</p>
<p>Not a surprise that this is going on in "Build Back Better" led countries, who are now all Globalists, and in favor of Agenda 2030 and "The Great Reset"</p>
