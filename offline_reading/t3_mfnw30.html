<title>So according to this, children might have antibodies for covid due to getting other coronaviruses, but not adults? If that's the case, then how come whenever my kid gets sick, I don't, and she is in my face and all over me all the time. Wouldn't that mean I have those antibodies already?</title>

        <p>Turning science on its head and creating political art out of it... sort of similar to last summer's selective enforcement of protocols where church gatherings (even outdoor ones observing distancing and masking) were subject to raids while ANTIFA and BLM protests were encouraged.</p>
<p>That is just another product of a situation whose end product is control- and has nothing to do with stopping any virus spread.</p>

        <p>If something starts with "some experts suggest that" something "might" be a certain way, then this usually means the claim is about as accurate as a coin-toss.</p>
<p>I also started to mentally substitute the word "expert" with "someone who is paid to rationalize an observation/claim/agenda".</p>
<p>I'd say that is a pretty fitting description of what the word expert means when it is used in the media.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this is a stupid argument.  People with kids, or that work with kids, or animals, do seem to have milder reactions to covid on average, but even kids without active immune systems yet are at no risk, so this argument is bunk.  If kids under 6 or 12mo were faring worse, this would makes sense, your average 0-2yo doesn't have the same level of cold exposure as one who has been in daycares or schools.</p>

        <p>My kid tested positive with some very mild, very short term symptoms and I didn't quarantine him like some kind of psycho. I usually split time with him 50/50 with his Dad, but I kept him the whole ten days. And ya, I didn't catch it.</p>

        <p>This past year has shown that medical research actually turns out to be way worse than psychology (the replication crisis - if you haven't heard of it look it up). Basically, medical research is prone to cherry picked data, hyperbole, and assumptions based on bias, just like any social science... The reason it's a much bigger problem is because it is held to some magical standard because of the occasional use of complex biology and chemistry and basic math... and it is used to inform policy and set regulations... This is a problem. Newsflash: smart people can lie even better, and dumber people will eat it up.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah. I know that all too well. Doctors and researches pockets are also filled with big pharma money.</p>
<p>I have thyroid disease and 99.9% of Doctors want to treat people with a sub par medicine for it because ScIeNcE says it's better. I belong to a group for people with thyroid disease. All their Doctors want to do it treat according to what big pharma has to say instead of treating a person by how they feel. Because for some reason, most Doctors feel as if a patient doesn't know their own body, but that Scientists know what is best because of bias research.</p>

        <p>I have to correct your title. “Due to getting other coronaviruses” in this small piece of text this is already incorrect. In the text they speak of the cold and not CoViD. Apart from that, kids have many more occasions of getting the gold since other kids are less careful as well. You on the other hand, are grossed out if you get someone else’s snot all over you and will wash your hands and the surface that had snot over it. Just like you’d turn your head when you notice that your child is about to sneeze all over you. Lastly, you get into close contact with less people than your kid. So your kid just has so many more opportunities to get sick.</p>
