        <p>I think ya would like this podcast. It’s about a doctor that saw the underlying implications of being a doctor. Which is essentially a drug dealer with a degree to sell certain drugs allowed by the fda. https://soundcloud.com/lindesy-quorri-brwon/escape-medical-tyranny-with-jennifer-daniels-rogue-ways-529</p>

        <p>It's not the doctor, it's the medical industry that we need to worry about.  There's a community of doctors that actually care about people.  Unfortunately they are getting silenced just like anybody who speaks truth these days.  Check out www.zachbushmd.com</p>

        <p>Agreed.  Most doctors go to med school to help people. A select few of them get off path and focus more on money than the wellbeing of their patients. These are the court cases you read about in the paper.</p>

        <p>Of course, but not per patient, or that can of course depend, but in my country doctors get a set yearly wage so they have absolutely no incentive to keep their patients sick. Of course we have to pay a bit for medical care, but it maxes out at 250 dollars per year.</p>

        <p>That is grossly inaccurate. Doctors take the Hippocratic oath. </p>
<p>A more accurate caption would be ‘hospital administrators (who are not doctors) and pharmaceutical executives (also not doctors). </p>
<p>There was a time when non-doctors could not run hospitals. That changed, and suddenly healthcare got very expensive. It’s not a coincidence.</p>

        <p>Really? Saintly doctors take the Hypocritical Oath, so therefore they what... never think about profit again ? Never shoot toxic adjuvants into infants? Are not among the leading causes of death in the US with their errors? Don't prescribe harmful drugs to people? Don't slash people and burn them with radiation? </p>
<p>Always advise their "patients" about nutrition and its healing probabilities? Always address the stress and depression components of illness? Learn about traditional holistic medical practices so they become well-rounded healers? Stay open to anything that will help those in their "care", even if a sociopathic pharmaceutical company can't profit off it?</p>

        <p>Learning about bullshit holistic treatments is not part of the oath. If you’re going to a western-trained doctor they will treat you in that fashion; if you think cupping and reiki are going to heal you,
go do that. </p>
<p>If you don’t care enough to even research how hospital administration is killing the medical profession and patients, then you deserve what you get. People with Harvard MBAs were never meant to run hospitals but somehow they now are. And they are maximizing profit at patient and doctor expense. Doctors used to have significantly more time to talk to patients about their health. They are now held to seeing double the patients they used to in order to maximize the hospital or medical group profits. And they are not owned by doctors, but by businessmen expecting a return on their investment. </p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies spend millions advertising. Why would you need to advertise something that is necessary to live? Think about that for a second. </p>
<p>Vilifying doctors is part of their strategy, and you are falling into it. It’s actually part of the far left strategy to socialize medicine. Socialized medicine doesn’t work because doctors are so poorly paid no one wants to do it. </p>
<p>Doctors are allowed to make a living , literally every other profession does so. It’s not evil to make money but they still follow professional standards. By your logic, no lawyer should make money either. They should never refuse a case even if the client cannot pay. And grocery stores should never try to make a profit. They should be giving food away for free. Landlords are disgusting for collecting rent. How can they deny people that cannot pay?</p>

        <p>Not at all! Everyone should be able to charge for their services. Whatever the free market will bear. (I know, I know, huge discussion for another time). But everyone should make some profit from their work, or they'll stop doing it. Of course!</p>
<p>What I object to is the corruption of medicine by bloated corporate money, and its deleterious effects on most allopathic physicians' willingness to actually care for actual patients (including looking farther afield than the half day on nutrition they got in med school).</p>
<p>I completely agree with you that hospital administration and its blindered for-profit bean-counting approach is a huge part of the problem. There's plenty of criticism to go all around the Rockefeller medical fraud system.</p>
<p>The fact that I notice the hubris and incompetence of many doctors doesn't mean I think most of the things you think I think. You blame the bean-counters, as do I- but I also hold *accountable the individuals who are the point of contact for the sick and injured, and who fail to honor anything like an actual Hippocratic oath.</p>

        <p>Wow your untrained self can determine incompetence in doctors? Pray tell, where did you get your medical degree? Same place as bill gates probably. </p>
<p>You don’t get to determine who is falling short of their oath as you clearly know nothing of the system. There is a state authority that regulates the profession and they will determine who is and isn’t competent and if violations occur. </p>
<p>The fault lies only with the non-doctors that saw a way to make a guaranteed profit. People will agree to pay anything when they or a loved one is sick. So force them into over paying for insurance and healthcare as they have no other option. Doctors are at the mercy of the system where lawmakers have changed all laws in favor of the insurance companies. </p>
<p>The doctor isn’t there to be your life coach and dietician.  You shouldn’t need to see a doctor to tell you to eat healthy and exercise. Their training isn’t to make you a meal plan and a workout routine. </p>
<p>And they shouldn’t just make ‘some profit’. They are entitled to a high wage because the provide a crucial service that takes years of investment. If you want them to earn a low wage, however little time you get with a doctor is only going to get worse.</p>

        <p>No. Any doctor will tell you to eat better. And get would do it more if they had the time. But their caseloads have doubled because insurance reimbursements and Medicare reimbursements have declined. In order to make a living and pay their staff (shocker, nurses don’t work for free) they have to see more patients. </p>
<p>If you’re angry about how you’re not getting enough time with your doctor, call your representative and tell them to regulate insurance and fund Medicare. Tell them to quit taking bribes (‘campaign donations’) from pharma, insurance, and hospital corporations.</p>

        <p>He said the vaccine is free so they aren't making money. I said they are for profit corporations who are making a product. What the fuck about what I said is even remotely controversial or relevant to what you just rambled about. And for the record lots of us agree with vaccinating the at-risk population. We disagree with making vaccines essentially mandatory to live a normal life. We disagree that we are posing a danger to you by not being vaccinated when the at-risk groups will have 95% immunity against a virus that they were already unlikely to catch, and in the off chance that they catch it will experience a significantly lower viral load and face a  0.0005% chance of hospitalization according to PBS.</p>

        <p>Pharmaceutical business is way more complicated but since I live in Europe I don't see how there is any serious difference in the way pharma companies make money? It doesn't matter whether people pay for it tru taxes or whether they pay for it directly, the outcome remains same - Pharmaceutical companies make money for selling medicals products.</p>
