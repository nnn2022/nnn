    <strong>Either there is asymptomatic transmission or there isn't. Make up your minds!</strong>
    <p><p>In the history of respiratory diseases, asymptomatic transmission has <strong>never</strong> been the driver of pandemics/epidemics. Yet, somehow we've accepted that this unicorn virus spreads asymptomatically.</p>
<p>But if there is asymptomatic transmission, why are you measuring my temperature when I'm going somewhere? If it spreads asymptomatically, you're not going to be able to do much, so why bother? When my temperature comes out normal, you let me go in without a mask. <strong>You accept that asymptomatic people don't transmit.</strong></p>
<p>It either does or doesn't spread, so make up your minds. If it does then there is no point. Fucking theater. Get rid of these masks for healthy people.</p></p>

        <p>We've known for months that the virus transmits via symptoms, i.e. coughing. WHO acknowledge this and was bullied into walking it back. All the research has confirmed it. Corporations and governments are still bullying healthy people into masking and isolating. </p>

        <p>It's the new normal. Every person without sickness symptoms is now called asymptomatic disease spreader.</p>
<p>Basically you are guilty by default. You can see the proof of what I am saying right there, because they demand to wear masks, to lock yourself up, to distance yourself etc. They treat you as an offender. Although they have absolutely no evidence on anything.</p>

<p>There are tons of other studies, articles and videos that talk about this. I think the bottom line is that it has long been known <em>the potential</em> for asymptomatic spread exists with all respiratory illness viruses but the main driver of spread has always been via prolonged exposure to symptomatic people, mostly coughing/sneezing. There's no evidence SARS-CoV-2 is meaningfully different in this regard.</p>
<p>That they have wildly blown out of proportion the danger of asymptomatic spread to justify life destroying measures that are still ongoing is a crime against humanity, there's no sugar-coating it.</p>

        <p>I had previously wondered if so called "asymptomatics" were just false positives.  With the new information about how many cycles are being run on the samples just to get a positive result, I am more positive than ever that this is true.   Asymptomatic people don't transmit because they DON'T HAVE COVID19!</p>

        <p>Edit: read the first part of your comment wrong woops. Anyways, my point about presymptomatic people still stands.</p>
<p>~I think we are a little confused here.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic = no symptoms</p>
<p>Presymptomatic = no symptoms until development of symptoms</p>
<p>Fever is a symptom. If you're febrile, you're by definition symptomatic. You can't have a fever and be considered asymptomatic. That's absurd.</p>
<p>And the only difference between pre and asymptomatic is that for the duration of the infection the asymptomatic person doesn't have any symptoms while the presymptomatic one goes on to develop it. Before the development of symptoms, clinically there is no difference.~</p>

        <p>And neither are important in the transmission of the virus or similar viruses. They're not major sources of transmission, nor effective modes of transmission, and there is no reason for people to walk around fearing their healthy bodies are shooting viruses, infecting and killing random others. If such transmission occurred it would be rare and most likely in households with prolonged very close contact. A respiratory virus that never caused symptoms (mostly due to the host's immune system successfully resisting) would be self limiting, same as a virus that disabled the majority of its hosts especially the young, healthy and most mobile would be self limiting.</p>

        <p>Yep, those are the definitions. The issue is pre-symptomatic to symptomatic is not so black and white. A person may be by clinical definition symptomatic, but not realize it (a slight fever, itchy throat, dry cough). So the assumption is everyone is pre-symptomatic on the verge of symptomatic because that's the safest bet. </p>
<p>I agree checking the temperature is a placebo, but it gives people a second to check  for masks, etc.</p>

        <p>The main driver has always been the symptomatic patient. </p>
<p>I've always had the sneaking suspicion that people had symptoms but attributed them to other things: allergies, irritants, not slept well, just not feeling right. Not thinking they were sick, they went out and spread it.</p>
<p>In that case, we need better education for symptom recognition or just plain acknowledgement of symptoms considering most people can't call in sick for even a day.</p>

        <p>This is absolutely the problem. Symptoms for covid apparently range from things like cough, fever, covid toes (seriously), irregular periods, hair loss.</p>
<p>Is it a hangover? Am I PMSing? Am I literally dying? </p>
<p>Covid has the worst PR team in the history of marketing. My poor daughter got worried when she noticed she lost some of her (massively long and thick) hair after brushing it. Bec she saw one celebrity say that if you shed hair in the shower its a sign of the virus. Ugh.</p>

        <p>The marketing has been terrible. People have been conditioned to think that if you have COVID that it's going to be this monstrous thing and you're gonna suffer and feel miserable for weeks.</p>
<p>However, for most people it's just another cold and passes with the same severity as any other cold. People got light symptoms and thought "Oh this can't be COVID. I'd be struggling to breathe and not be able to get out of bed if it was that" and then they went out and spread it.</p>
