    <p><p>I know a lot of people in here felt like life lacked purpose. I know a lot of you have thought about our ancestors getting through enormous struggles and great battles to tell their grandchildren about their accomplishments. This is our battle. We won't get out of this by whining online and resisting a shot. I know it sounds insane and scares you, but I also know that deep down you all know that I'm right. We will have to fight to survive this and I think we're just waiting for someone to lead us.</p></p>

        <p>I'm still optimistic that all this bullshit will soon disappear...  </p>
<p>They can't keep hiding all the "vaccine" deaths and injuries...there are too many.</p>
<p>People are also starting to realize that we are NOT the minority, but the actual majority.  The continued propaganda will not work on those that are already firmly in their places...  it only comforts those that have already submitted.</p>

        <p>I agree that it's not enough BUT it is necessary in that it brings like minded people together and we need to find one another. The internet has become increasingly micromanaged and it will continue to shrink as far as freedom of speech and being able to share information which is not state approved. Now we are being told our personal messages will soon be censored. The only way we can truly communicate uncensored and find one another is in person.</p>
<p>Protests aren't going to change anything directly but the people who attend can connect and form local groups. A close friend of mine went to one and met up with fellow parents and did get her kids school to agree to change some things everyone was unhappy with.</p>
