<p>Or it could lead to being forcibly vaccinated against your will. That is a reason why the Second Amendment is important. Even though I'm not an anti-vaxxer, I do not want to live in a dystopian society where the government can decide to round up and kill kinds of people they do not like or force such things upon the people.</p>

        <p>Doesn't the possibility that they very well might do that make you at least consider the anti-vaxx argument? Why should they have to force us to comply with something so obviously good? It's like saying anti-vaxxers are insane. Maybe look into why we feel that way</p>

        <p>I’ve seen the main arguments against the COVID-19 vaccine and they are not unreasonable. The vaccine is being rushed and there is a fear that it will be mandated. If the vaccine is needed to be able to live a “normal” life, many rights of ours would be stripped from us as they would effectively become privileges.</p>

<p>Hate to break it to you but this has already been the case since March. </p>
<p>The precedent has been set that governors can declare indefinitely long states of emergency in response to a public health risk, under which they have complete authority to regulate all aspects of life for people in their states, with the “protections” of the Bill of Rights no longer relevant. And since there is literally nothing that could not in principle be considered a risk to public health, this means that, in effect, individual rights no longer exist. And pretty much no one anywhere close to the mainstream has even questioned this; they’ll debate about how long we should stay locked down, or whether masks should be mandatory, but no one questions the authority to implement the lockdowns in the first place.</p>
<p>Freedom is dead in this country, at least as an earnestly-held political ideal. We certainly aren’t living in anything like a stereotypical police state yet, but it is now undeniable that we are no longer living in a nation where there is even the pretense that there exist any limits on government power. The only viable move at this point for those who still value freedom is to abandon any remaining hope of achieving solutions through politics/government and start focusing on finding ways they can actually create their own freedom for themselves and those they care about.</p>

        <p>It's a fallacy to assume it will always happen</p>
<p>It's a primary source data point to observe that it almost always <em>has happened</em></p>
<p>As an example, saying "Oh you want the gays to get married? What's next, guidance councillors forcing our children to go trans?" is a slippery slope fallacy. There is no reason, in and of itself, to assume that that will happen.</p>
<p>But saying "Oh, the gays got married, and then three years later guidance councillors are forcing our children to go trans." is not a fallacy, it's just <em>actually what happened</em></p>

        <p>I am so fucking scared. I feel like today has taken a turn for the worse. More places mandating masks, more lockdowns seem to be on the horizon. Is there a self-sustainable commune I can move to?! I’m not even joking. I’ve actually been researching some... some things are a deal breaker though- like I need running water and I can’t stick to an all vegan diet.

        <p>On a very serious note, maybe South Dakota. Aside from schools, they were the only state to never lockdown <em>and</em> force businesses to close (most shutdown anyway, though). If you have the means, opportunity, and money, then move if you want. But you need to get all your affairs in order like having a job, a place to live, etc. Moving is actually tough, and stressful, so make sure you have all your ducks in a row if you do go through with it.</p>

        <p>Can you leave the US? I'm in India and while this doesn't necessarily seem like the best place for the long term, in the short term it's great. In a community of like-minded people, having gatherings with no masks and discussing the commune type future you have in mind. Some of us are vegan, many are not (like my boyfriend.) It's dirt cheap, especially if you work remotely. </p>
<p>We are also eyeing Koh Phangan. And plan C my partner has friends who started a commune in Siberia (he's Russian, we would get married). If we were forced to return to the states, god forbid, we'd go to one of the smaller islands in Hawaii.</p>

        <p>I would be open to leaving the US. I went to Hawaii a long time ago (Oahu) and it was beautiful. I’m keeping an open mind so thank you for the info 😊</p>

        <p>Saw this comment and I'm hoping you can give me some good on the ground info from other expats you might be around.</p>
<p>First off check out Hawaii Bill HB2502 SD1.  Hawaii used to be on my list but if this passes on Monday it's automatically off my list.  This bill is likely going to be used to block the native Hawaiians from bringing in help either interisland or from outside Hawaii to buoy up their protests which were going really well before all of this pandemic stuff started.</p>
<p>Me and my partner were initially going to do our tiny mobile house thing but it is looking more and more like we should leave the US.  We are considering our options and know the info on the internet is crappy at best so I'm hoping for info from you or people around you since you're outside the country already.</p>
<p>Any good leads on where to go?  He said Ecuador which I think Freelee the Banana Girl is there living off grid.  I'm open to suggestions as my 4 criteria are:  clean air, clean earth, clean water, a lot less big brother and western medical intrusion</p>
<p>If you get any good leads as well please feel free to message me directly here on reddit.  I'm all ears.</p>
<p>edit: started some research and I am seriously considering Tanzania as it fits our criteria from what I can tell plus they used an anti-malaria herbal remedy imported from another African country to treat as well.  I am starting to think it is best to go where the WHO has no reach</p>

        <p>Gordon White from Rune Soup is currently permaculturing in Tanzania and I think that’s a really good spot if you can get there.</p>
<p>Koh Phangan has a solid community already functioning if you can get down with the vegan yoga crowd (but the best sort— I am admittedly a vegan yogi but I understand the stereotype and it’s negative connotations.)</p>
<p>Portugal seems to be on a lot of alternative culture radars- everyone I know is considering going there, but they are still in Big Brother EU so who knows. I was there last summer and really liked the lifestyle.</p>
<p>India... it’s hard to tell, but none of our good friends here in Goa want to stay here long term. The mountains are amazing though. </p>
<p>Ecuador is also on people’s lists here. Costa Rica also, but they are stricter. My brother is currently in Costa Rica and really enjoying it. Also more expensive for central / South America.</p>
<p>Honestly, the whole situation currently is so mind-boggling and it’s hard to know where to go / how to make it happen. But there are many of us wanting to create a different sort of reality 🙏🏻</p>

        <p>Surely if you have your items scanned and they decline a legal tender like cash you can just assume it’s free at that point and take it? Sounds silly and probably is but if a shop worker doesn’t want my coin, then cheers for the free stuff good sir</p>

        <p>I just leave it on the checkout in front of them and walk off with the goods - legal exchange of goods or services for money complete. Means I sometimes lose out on change if I don't have the correct amount, but its worth it to see their reaction when they realise I've paid over the odds with legal tender that they can't legally refuse and have no grounds to have security stop me or call the police. Funnily enough I can often hear the chime of the til being opened as I walk away...</p>

        <p>Apparently - I have no concrete evidence - there's a movement afoot in the psychology community to label all "resisters/deniers/objectors" as exhibiting a psychopathic-type syndrome. If true, this would be 💯 in line with the Stalinist practice of putting people who disagreed with the official line in psychiatric hospitals.
