    <strong>I feel the world has a long way to go even after getting vaccinated.</strong>
    <p><p>Even though I'm glad people are getting vaccinated and that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, I still feel like it's not going to be over yet. At least not mentally. The world needs healing. </p>
<p>Not trying to sound like a doomer, but I think some people have completely underestimated how much this whole panoramic (yes I'm calling it that from now on) has affected people mentally.</p>
<p>The government forcing people to stay inside, not having human contact, people being faceless, and the fearmongering garbage from news outlets, and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Countless people across the world are feeling pent up emotions because of everything that's happened in the past year, and they haven't gotten the help they need to deal with those emotions because the government was like "stay inside! no human contact! Obey us! It's for your own good!"</p>
<p>Besides, no one in this day and age has ever lived through a global panoramic before, and I'm wondering if there's going to be some kind of mental fallout from all this. Just because someone gets vaccinated doesn't mean they're mentally ready to go to crowded movie theaters or conventions with a bunch of coughing strangers.</p></p>

        <p>People are now psychologically conditioned to view themselves as murderers if they engage in social behavior.  The damage is real.  </p>
<p>Just looking at the amount of hostility displayed towards maskless strangers, you can tell how mindfucked people are.  A sane person would just steer clear of a maskless stranger if they were truly afraid of the virus.  What we're seeing is the effect of programming.  </p>
<p>The election and the pandemic screwed this country up beyond repair.</p>

        <p>Yep. Add to that the economy as well. Over here they say 'maybe, if we all keep doing our best, the stores can be open again in the summer.'</p>

        <p>Yes, it will take time. People who've been scared out of their box will take a long time to stop wearing masks and start going to crowded places. People who've gotten used to the home routine will take time to adjust to busier schedules and more socialising. People like us will take time to trust others again and see the good in things. I mean it's obviously much more complex than that but it'll take a time to get people's brains screwed on right. For this reason, we can't be hostile. We, the skeptics, may harbour resentment to people because of their complacency in what's been done, but as much as we need to deal with that we can't let it take over. We aren't scared of going out, and we need to be the ones inviting people out and reminding them of the joys of normal life.</p>

        <p>This comment is great. You're right, we have to help people feel life again. Because 99% of us all want that to happen. Its just unfortunate how a small loud minority can dictate peoples lives. The majority needs to stand up and say "NO" and now is the best time</p>
