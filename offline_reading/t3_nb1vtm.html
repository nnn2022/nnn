        <p>If I were an evil genius,
I would see a sickness as an opportunity.
I would tell people that the way to naturally prevent the sickness is incorrect.
I would tell them that everything that worked before no longer works.</p>
<p>I would take away anything that could fix it,
I would tell them the air is harmful.
I would tell them a hug could be lethal, and human contact was a threat.</p>
<p>I would take away their livelihoods,
(we have to slow the spread).
I would take away their families,
(we have to protect each other).
I would take away their friendships,
(We can’t associate with those who question or disagree).
I would take away the things that bring joy,
(It’s a temporary sacrifice).</p>
<p>I would convince them this was the only way.
I would convince them that I knew what’s best.
I would convince them the innocent are guilty of the spread (so they don’t realize it’s me).
I would empower them to shame the innocent and anyone who questioned the narrative 
(So they don’t question me).
I would convince them that the innocent are the problem (If only they would comply).
and I was the solution (Get my vaccine, it’s the only way).</p>
<p>I would convince them the cure was the poison, and the poison was the cure.</p>
<p>And then if I was an evil genius, I would profit off of all the lies and let them live in fear. </p>
<p>If I was an evil genius, I wouldn’t care about the wreckage I caused.</p>

        <p>Even calling it health fascism is ceding the word health to these modernist fools. They aren't interested in health or they would have banned fast food and high carb foods already, they are interested in making trillions from drugs subsidised by the taxpayer.</p>
