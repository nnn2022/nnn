        <p>Honestly I haven't read or seen enough of his testimony or about what he's doing to understand if/how he's personally using it on his patients, or if he's just referring to all the studies in other countries. Is he actually prescribing it? </p>
<p>I hope he's right about it, and I hope the NHI changes their guidelines. But I'm not a researcher or scientist and I'm not sure I could read whatever unpublished reviews or whatever he's referring to that came out in the last 3 months he thinks will change their mind, and convince myself to take the horse medicine version like he said they do in South America until my doctor is on board with it. </p>
<p>I am kinda put off by the "cure" double-talk:
At 6:20 "we found the cure for Covid".</p>
<p>At 7:47 "we're not saying we found the cure for covid".</p>
<p>and that he's one of the "5 smartest guys in covid"--and the other 4 just happen to be his colleagues he's working with from his web site--er, ok? </p>
<p>But what the hell do I know. Maybe he is one of the 5 smartest and maybe it's a cure. Could very well be. The best I can tell, he really sounds like he believes it is extremely effective and maybe the closest thing to a cure he's seen, and if I were to guess he wants to say it's a cure to get heard, but then he checks himself because he knows he really shouldn't say that.</p>
