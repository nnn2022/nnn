    <strong>Need some help refuting the official death count for COVID</strong>
    <p><p>My family are COVID doomers and believe every single rumor or media disinformation about COVID. One dubious statistic that they always come back to is the claim that 250k Americans have died of COVID-19 this year. I find this claim to be extremely suspect, as there have been numerous media reports of "COVID fatalities" that turned out to be deaths caused by an entirely different factor altogether. For example, my mom shared a story about a "healthy 16 year old" who died of COVID, but neglected to mention that the teenager was also diagnosed with diabetes and was far above the threshold for DKA when he was admitted to the hospital. My mom claimed that that was only an anecdote and that the "statistics don't lie" about COVID deaths. </p>
<p>I don't doubt that people have died of COVID, but I do not believe that it has caused 250k deaths directly. If the virus is as contagious as scientists claim, then it is extremely unlikely that it has caused this number of deaths. Even a Plague Inc. player would be able to tell you that deadly viruses don't spread very far, and vice versa, viruses that are extremely contagious are rarely lethal. What I'm looking for, however, are resources that dispel or give compelling evidence that questions the official death toll of COVID.</p></p>

        <p>I believe the CDC themselves said that only 5% of USA deaths had covid as the only potential cause the person had. Every other person had something else. Wether it be chronic disease or injury only 5% had no other possible cause for death. And USA isnt the only one to have that. In Italy almost 99% of deaths had other health problems that could have caused their death. Plus make them watch a video by Zach Star called "this is how easy it is to lie with statistics" it will debunk their "statistics dont lie" pretty quick because all people really do is lie with statistics. Google what I'm telling you also, I found it all in a Bloomberg article so read it for yourself</p>

        <p>That video should be posted on here. I donâ€™t know how to do it. He should update it to include covid. Pretty much gives away the game. Thanks for sharing.</p>
