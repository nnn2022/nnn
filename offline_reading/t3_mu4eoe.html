    <p><p>I try to be someone who goes out of their way to learn the science behind many daily things and even the grand things, it’s been an interest of mine for a while. As I’ve observed people over the years it has always been apparent the encroaching shift in the field of science for everyday people. </p>
<p>What I have noticed is people are constantly looking to science not for what it can teach us or the mysteries of life it can answer, but what it can do for us. This commercialized science has been peddled to people for so long they thought that this was what science is about. I’m sure you’ve seen the kind of what this is/has been utilized. </p>
<p>The Dyson commercials explaining why their fan costs 900$ because “our expert scientists have figured out a way to increase air output by 30%” that kind of marketing bs. To be honest with all of you, it was a good youtuber named ThunderF00t that enlightened me fully on how this was happening. He does “busted” videos for popular new items and concepts that are being glamorized, and talks about their feasibility through actual science.  It’s because he has the credentials and equipment to do the tests that prove many times its all just bs and marketing to get dumb people to invest/buy. </p>
<p>So enter this covid climate. </p>
<p>People who vastly understood little to no science prior to covid, are suddenly worshippers of science now. It seems like just because they have access to the internet and can see the words “doctor” before a sentence, that automatically means it is based in science and truth. </p>
<p>If every doctor was ethical and honest though, we wouldn’t have had lead gasoline/paint killing people, cigarette companies avoiding liability, asbestos house insulation causing illness, and every billion dollar industry that avoids liability while they pollute them planet with their by product waste. </p>
<p>When money is involved, even for the greater good people don’t understand that morals fly out the window. Even for scientific people and doctors. Why is this? It’s not solely because people are selfish and only care about profit, it’s also because how the industry itself is. Investing years into schooling to be a doctor or scientist is expensive, and in many cases being a renounced researcher, doesn’t actually pay the bills. You always need funding because science isn’t just magically applying science to something to produce amazing stuff, it’s doing testing, trial and error, and needing a lot of resources. </p>
<p>This is why I’ve seen seemingly good intentions become bad, because scientists need their funding even if it’s coming from the hand of a corrupt individual. They literally can’t “bite the hand that feeds them” otherwise they wouldn’t be able to continue doing their research and wouldn’t reach their goal. </p>
<p>These days it’s not science itself people worship but instead what they are being told is the science. We know what that really means is what the science is telling them the resolution to all this insanity will be. </p>
<p>I fully understand how comforting it may sound to hear that “this wonderful scientific breakthrough” will finally put an end to lockdowns, masks, social distancing, not being able to go out and party etcetera. On paper wether you trust the vaccine and the science, or you don’t, it does sound like exactly what we need right now, the end of all this fuckery. </p>
<p>Perspective is how I have started and finished throughout covid. This nonsense isn’t just a result of the scary COVID-19, no. Covid is the scapegoat, it’s the very real virus that exists, that government has used to their advantage. That’s all. I know it’s easy to go off the deep and and get into these conspiracies but it’s really simple - bad people will use any excuse they can to take advantage of others. It happens in every facet of life, why do people adamantly believe the government is not exploitive opportunists? Well personally I know most people do not actually believe the government isn’t, what I know is their desire for the easy going and “safe” life outweighs their desire to put any effort in to questioning or resisting the narrative. </p>
<p>With covid, everyone one of us, enlightened or sheep, has been subject to breakdown conditioning over the course of a year of lockdown, economical and social collapsing, civil unrest, immediate fear of death (caused by media propaganda), threat of fine, jail, covid hotel. Just living with the truth of what is going on is stressful enough, let alone having to go out into this covid clown world and fight, resist, stand up for basic humanity. </p>
<p>Yeah, I know why these regular people are suddenly “science” apostles. To them, The big bad covid has caused so much suffering to their life, and now they cling to the first solution they see. First it was masks and lockdowns. “If you just wear a mask and social distance and we close all non essential business everything will be fine” meanwhile they (officials) were still doing whatever they wanted, taking flights to their vacation home in other countries, colluding behind closed doors, seen literally on tv when they do briefings, not wearing a mask as they talk. It was all the guise of “just listen to us and we can get back to normal” “2weeks to curb this”</p>
<p>Next it was the vaccine. “Just take the shot and we can go back to normal”. </p>
<p>Through this people are constantly grasping at straws just to feel a semblance of hope for getting back to “normal”.  Except sadly there is no more normal. Covid has been the catalyst for allowing the government to usher in a new way of living. </p>
<p>I don’t care if you believe that they created covid, or whatever else conspiracy, all that remains is the truth that they are using covid as an excuse to further oppress us, because it makes their job of governing us that much easier. It’s not really that hard to see and understand that, I know most people would if they took time out of being emotional and fearful to look at all of this. But like I said they just want the hope of getting back to normal because that’s all they have known, and humans fear change. </p>
<p>When in reality the hope they should seek is that of hoping to be told the truth from elected officials and oath sworn doctors. They should be hoping they can summon the courage to stand up and resist the regime, the lies, the corrupt politicians, who, if they actually cared about covid and people, would have done more sooner, and not conducted hypocritical, unconstitutional acts on the daily.</p>
<p>But what do we know we are “jUsT sOmE suB of MisinFoRmatiOn” right? </p>
<p>To them people like us only care about killing babies and old people by not wearing a mask....</p>
<p>People don’t understand the science of this at all. Prior to covid, an old sick person would generally need precautions in place to prevent them getting ill, doctors wear masks around sick patients all the time because their immune is so weak they couldn’t even fight off common daily bacteria we all carry. Covid is a virus that can be deadly to these people, yes, but it’s not the only thing that could have taken them out. People weren’t freaking out of masks before why? because they weren’t fear-porned into freaking out. Your 80 year old nana in the hospital, you should have still wore a mask around her. But that’s it, when you’re in the hospital around sick people. </p>
<p>Now apparently we are all sick and we all need protect eachother from eachother... it’s insanity</p>
<p>Personal protection is what you must exercise. If you feel like your body is at risk then you make the choice to stay home, wear a mask, wash your hands before eating or touching any part on your head. Stock up in multi vitamins, soups, teas, well known remedies to fight off nasal intrusions and serious infection. No matter how much I wear a mask, or how much I wash my hands, if the person(s) at risk of covid are not taking steps to protect themselves, nothing I do will stop that. </p>
<p>It’s the same with this vaccine, which is the hot topic nobody wants to accept or even talk about because to them the notion of saving lives supersedes logic. </p>
<p>Vaccine can help an individual fight off covid, that’s it. Vaccine does not resist infection, it doesn’t create a magical barrier in your sinus/lung that repels covid. You still get covid, you still host it, it still propagates within your body aka, by definition it still infects you. You’ll just not be as likely to die from it or have severe symptoms. This super spreader notion is nonsense. </p>
<p>For a virus to super spread it would have to mean that your body has allowed the virus to multiply fruitfully to a point that is many times in excess to what it first was when it entered your body. For that to happen, you would have to have symptoms of an infection though, it’s impossible to be that level of infection by foreign material and not show symptoms. </p>
<p>This means you’d be sick. If you’re actually sick, you probably won’t be going outside to “super spread” to begin with. A healthy person can spread a virus, but not “super spread” it.</p>
<p>Hell, an overload of pollen to the immune system triggers allergies, symptoms of illness like runny nose, sneezing, headache. Seasonal allergies which is literally just trees seeds can reveal sick symptoms in people, how can you actually believe a bacterial infection like covid would propagate within a body and show no signs in the person... it’s just complete stupidity. </p>
<p>If the super spreader narrative is to be believed that’s literally admitting covid is not severe at all, if it can severely multiply in a person without them getting symptoms or sick. That means the human immune system literally sees tree pollen as more of a threat than covid lol. </p>
<p>But anyways, the vaccine topic is a and always should be a matter or personal choice. As much as I would like laws in place that stop stupidity from happening I wouldn’t want the current political governing bodies to be the ones enforcing this. People are going to kill those lives with stupid choices no matter what, smoking, drinking, junk food, and now the rush to take a vaccine. Make your own choices, I don’t care that much, but not make me forced to do something that is regarding my health. </p>
<p>If the vaccine was some flawless item literally handed down by god, I would still question it. It’s going inside my body and can affect me for years to come. Even worse is the covid shot they are calling a vaccine, the mRna, which literally is gene splicing... it convinces our own healthy cells to create covid, so we can then build an immunity to it by having it. It’s different from a vaccine, and in both human and animal history it’s never been tested long term, we don’t know what altering ourselves at a cellular level will do in the years to come, or how it may affect our children. And all this unknown to me, IS more scary than the risk of being in the the 0.9% of people dying SOLELY from covid. </p>
<p>With all that I’ve said, it’s easy to not believe in what is being peddled. We have all the tools at our disposal to question everything. It’s free to do so, exercise this freedom until the answers are provided, never stop seeking the truth people! Thanks for reading</p></p>

        <p>I agree with virtually everything you said. However, I would counter that, despite this largely being a opportunistic license to pass heavy-handed legislation, covid <em>may</em> actually be transmissible enough to warrant things like masks. Look at the US - they are rescinding mask mandates and things are going back to normal. Look, I agree that it should've been more focused on the vulnerable, and these ridiculous ideas about masks and restrictions lasting forever were insane. But, you seem to admit this is a contagious deadly virus. At some level, does that not warrant some <em>temporary</em> restriction of freedoms for the sake of dulling the virus spread? I'm from Canada, and I think the restrictions here have generally gone too far. However, even as a quite libertarian person, I wouldn't want to assign the gov't zero authority to try to put in place measures to curb the spread. Just curious where your appropriate level lies.  </p>
<p>Finally, I'm totally on board with your analysis of science worship, especially by people who very rarely use science in the perfectly unbiased way, or at all in other aspects of their lives. Like you say, "trust the science" is more of a rhetorical cudgel to one-up the person they're debating against. However, if there's anything to regard as a miracle in this situation, it is in my opinion vaccines. I respect your right not to take it, and your right to not have to disclose this information for basically any purpose, but to me it's pretty clear what vaccines are doing to this virus. I believe vaccines will obliterate this virus or reduce it greatly, so that only the most delusional governments (and populaces) would have the ability to keep milking this virus for its authoritarian license. In this sense, vaccines break the theory of or path towards the New Normal. I shudder to think what governments would be able to convince their populations of as necessary if they had 3-4 years to suppress us and impregnate us with fear instead of only the 1 year they had.</p>

        <p>Part 1</p>
<p>Yeah I’m in Ontario, Douglas is a damn fool. </p>
<p>Yes, the virus is real and transmissible. Measures should have been taken not for covid solely but in general for proper hygiene to lessen the spread of all bacteria and viruses. It would also lessen other forms of sickness, cross contamination allergies, food poisoning. Even in this advanced society general sanitary practices are practiced so little.</p>
<p>Me, I’m not a germaphobe but I do have some odd regiments. Like for example I have multiple sets of clothes for the same day depending on what I’m doing. Going to work, sleeping, lounging, gaming, cooking, going out. I have different clothing sets for all of these to both minimize dirt accumulation and possible bacteria.</p>
<p>I look at Americans basically as swine. Like, wearing your shoes inside your house and even to your bedroom 🤢 </p>
<p>If people were more hygienic as a whole covid would probably be half as deadly just from that. Then educate people. YES you should social distance from vulnerable people just to be safe. The media is trying to make it seem like we are all vulnerable, or that somehow if nobody wore masks it would cause a butterfly effect that travels to the at risk people. NO. If little jimmy just washed his hands, sure a mask before going to see grandma in the nursing home it wouldn’t matter if he did or didn’t have covid. The chance of him spreading it is slim </p>
<p>The FINAL person in the chain should be taking responsibility when/if they have to be around at risk people. The entire society isn’t supposed to be liable for everyone else’s risk. </p>
<p>I personally know nobody who is classify is at risk, and neither am I. So I won’t wear a mask because I’m not going to kill anyone in my family/friends. If an at risk person does hang around the people I do, it’s on that person that I know to take steps to mitigate the impact they may have.</p>
<p>So in Ontario there are actually parts where the speed limit has been increased to 110 kmh. This is proof that under the right conditions we can be a better and faster society. If one person crashes at 110, does it makes sense to then reduce the speed limit for the entire road to 60khm? Dumb people are going to crash at any speed, just like they will be negligent around at risk People and give them covid. In neither case should the masses be punished. This is my take on the way government influence should be used. Well I know it’s not sound like a “solution” but it’s essentially, government should dedicate resources into education. Like how fucked is it that we graduate high school not knowing what taxes are or how to do them, compulsory driving lessons aren’t a thing, neither is learning how to bank, finance, mortgage, about the only useful thing taught in school is cooking and yet that class is seen as a girls class lol. Education is vastly underfunded here, I went to a fairly good Catholic high school that had decent funding and yet the text books were decades old. The only class I ever learned anything that stuck wasn’t because of the materials provided but because of the teachers ability to stimulate my mind for the subject. </p>
<p>How does this help? Well to me it’s common sense that if you are living in a world where a viral pandemic of any severity is prevalent you should take steps before interacting with at risk people. We currently live in a society where this is not common sense to a lot of people, and worse yet the at risk people either don’t know they are at risk, or don’t care because they aren’t even that concerned for their life to begin with.</p>
