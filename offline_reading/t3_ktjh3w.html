    <strong>Told to be scared, very scared!</strong>
    <p><p>Live in Toronto, Canada and our premier today told us that next week they will release models that "will knock us off our chair" told to be scared, very scared of what's going to happen. So sick of this. People here are begging for hard lock downs because it's a tragedy when 80 &amp; 90 year olds die.</p>
<p>Don't see your friends or family, stay home. Don't go to work if you're not essential. Don't go to the gym, not allowed to play rec sports. We care about the safety of our citizens lol bunch of bullshit. Can't excersise but stay home and watch tv and uber some McDonald's. </p>
<p>I have a small business and it was finally starting to boom before COVID and now I am on the verge of bankruptcy. Tired of this fear mongering shit. 4000+ cases is all the news talks about. Radio, government officials with their safe jobs telling us we're all in this together. Guy on the radio I listen to is literally begging for hard lock down. So out of touch. Just so done with all this fear mongering. Since when did everyone think government and media tell the truth and have our best interest in mind? Fuck this.</p></p>

        <p>It's funny how desperate they're getting. I watched the press conference, its no exaggeration that he was literally threatening the public with harsher measures if numbers didn't go down. Couple that with the attempt to scare people with the model that just sounded pathetic - I mean if it's really so scary and dangerous, why are you waiting until next week to bring it up? Pathetic.</p>
<p>I think they know that more and more people are just not buying it. Heck even the people who are genuinely concerned about the virus are starting to call BS because these measures don't make any sense. </p>
<p>Let's see how well this new round of restrictions manages to piss people off.</p>

        <p>Exactly. If it was so serious they would implement restrictions immediately. Why provoke fear for people to dwell on over the weekend?</p>

        <p>I think it's a manipulation tactic, almost like how hype is used to market all kinds of things. You don't just release a movie or a video game, you need to have some trailers for it that show off how bombastic it's going to be. Well, consider his approach a trailer for upcoming restrictions. </p>
<p>It could also be a tactic to see the kind of response that this measure will get out of the population. Meaning they do this to see how the public responds, especially to see how pissed off some people will get and if there's a lot of them, and then tailor their response accordingly.</p>

        <p>This is one thing I was laughing about with my partner, if the models are so dire, and ICUs are fucked and going to shut down soon (I read about the 400 cases in the news), then what the fuck did they think they would do if the earlier models were correct? LOL at one point Ontario was predicting 6000 cases per day by Christmas, and that wasn't even based on any supposed 'new variant'... I think a big part of this new model is so they can blame their huge fucking failure on some new mystery devil and not you know, their own incompetence of not following their own recommendations a few weeks ago.</p>

        <p>It's a massive embarrassment. Everyone is calling on the government to do something but to be honest, there isn't that much the government can even do. I mean how do you stop a virus from spreading? You would literally need to weld every single person in the country into their homes, and that's not rhetorical. But of course people don't understand that so they scream "do something you need to do something!" </p>
<p>And of course the government reciprocates by putting in measures that are meant more so to look like they're doing something, vs actually doing something. But all they're really doing is shooting themselves in the foot since it's very obvious these measures won't work. So maybe they'll look good for the media for a couple of days, but that will quickly fade when nothing changes.</p>

        <p>Write to the premiere, let him know how you feel. Write to your local officials too. It doesn't matter if you never hear back, point is to make your voice heard. The people begging for lockdowns certainly aren't holding back, neither should we.</p>
<p>And before you think it's hopeless, I wrote a couple of emails to my own local officials here and I actually got a response; turns out they're pissed off about these measures too and at least some are trying to take the fight to the Ontario government. So you never know!</p>
