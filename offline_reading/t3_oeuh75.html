    <strong>Online Dating Got Even Weirder</strong>
    <p><p>Recently, I went on Bumble for the first time in about a year.  I matched with a professor. We seemed to click over text until about half an hour into the conversation when he asked if I was vaccinated. I started to explain than I am not anti-vaccine but had not been vaccinated. That’s about as far as I got before he launched into this tirade about how selfish I was, blah blah blah. Then he quickly unmatched me, which is like blocking, but it deletes the entire exchange. </p>
<p>Epilogue:
Before he unmatched, I was able to grab screenshots of his tirade. I was feeling petty, so I found him on Twitter, attached the screenshots, and left a comment that he unmatched me before I finished explaining. He never responded, but I felt a little avenged. I haven’t been back onto any online dating sites.</p></p>
