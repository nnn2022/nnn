    <strong>I'm moving temporarily for the sake of my mental health with my boyfriend's mother, who's requiring I get vaccinated before I move in. I'm really worried about it.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm really nervous about this vaccine. I'd rather wait it out and let it pass or something along those lines. I just don't think it's personally necessary for me to get it? I'm rather careful despite not really believing much around me. </p>
<p>Has anyone here received the vaccine? How have you guys felt? Has it affected your lives at all?</p></p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% IFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual IFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>So no, this vaccine definitely isn’t necessary for you—or for anyone else, for that matter. All I can say is that while I get that you need to improve your mental health, getting this vaccine for the sake of a temporary move is <em>not</em> the way to do that. It’s like becoming a junkie to deal with a toothache—it might technically solve your problem, but it’s not the best way to do it, and it creates many more problems than it solves. </p>
<p>You need a better way to help improve your mental health—one that doesn’t involve compromising your physical health. A new hobby outside your current home might help, especially one that gets you active, like running or sports (maybe you and your friends or bf can play tennis, basketball, jog, cycling, etc. together?). Even if you end up running/cycling by yourself, just getting moving definitely helps a lot.</p>

        <p>im 16 and got the vaccine already. the only side effects where a sore arm in both shots and a little internal fever the second, not much bad and it was gone within 24 hours. sure, i was feeling shitty, but its worth it because i have asthma and any respiratory infections will most likely land me in the hospital, or at least knock me down a few days/2 weeks. since the shots, ive felt great and i even got to get out of getting tested after 3 people i sit next to for a class tested positive. i just had a doctors appointment yesterday and my vitals are all fine even while wearing a mask when it was hard to breathe due to my panicking and the heat. </p>
<p>i dont care if you get the shot or not, but if you do decide, it would be quicker to get the j&amp;j since you only get one shot. the risk of death is almost zero. unless you are allergic to any ingredients listed on the sheet they give you, youd be fine. hope your move goes fine!!</p>
