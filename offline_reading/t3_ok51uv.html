<p>Here are things we know that are acknowledged and accepted by “mainstream” media and the establishment:</p>
<p><strong>Pharma is</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ol7cxp/pharma_corruption/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">corrupt.</a></p>

<p><strong>Media is</strong> <a href="http://carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php">controlled.</a></p>
<p><strong>Criminal overlords love</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/otikuk/criminal_overlords_still_crazy_about_eugenics/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">eugenics</a></p>

<p><strong>And yet so many believe that out of all this corruption, greed and love of eugenics… that vaccines made by criminals and mostly false re$earch are magically safe and effective.</strong></p>

<p>There have been 5,057 COVID deaths since then, of which 4,986 people were unvaccinated and 71 people were fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Also, there have been 297,753 total COVID cases since then, of which 293,846 people were unvaccinated and 3,907 people were fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>“These numbers show the reason to get vaccinated,” said Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health. “It’s unbelievable actually. It’s mind-blowing.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is the people who remain unvaccinated really have a significantly increased risk of becoming delta factories,” he added. “There’s a significantly higher risk for themselves and a risk of transmission to others.”</p>
<p>There have been reports of immunocompromised people possibly needing a third dose of the vaccine, noted Davidson Hamer, a Boston University specialist in infectious diseases.</p>
<p>“It’d be important for the state to analyze whether these people who were hospitalized and died were immunocompromised, if they had underlying conditions or some sort of other risk factors,” he said.</p>
