    <strong>"I'll have to do some research into that"</strong>
    <p><p>My best friend and I are somehow still friends despite me being here and him being vaccinated. It's interesting. We've tabled the covid discussions until the winter lockdowns (he doesn't believe they're coming but I'm hoping they'll be his breaking point) but there's still plenty of other contemporary nonsense we have non-conversations about.</p>
<p>I broached the subject of Biden's most recent comments on gun control (you know the ones) today, and he gave me the titular line after I heard his keyboard clack away at a fact-check by Google (we live in different states, keep in touch with calls over videogames). Made me realize how often I've heard variations of that from him, and that it's an easy get-out-of-jail-free card for these people. I'm already well familiar with how regularly he never brings back up literally anything we table, but it was interesting tonight to be able to articulate by what mechanism it happens.</p>
<p>Not letting him off the hook again. Next attack on the 2nd amendment, I'm bringing it up, and whatever variation of the "I'll make a note to Fact-Checkâ„¢ that and get back to you" I hear from him, I'll tell him to do it now, there's no reason to make the conversation wait. Curious how that will go...</p></p>

        <p>I have relationships like this. I no longer actively aid and abet their development. It's sad, but truth is more important than friendship. It's very sad.</p>
