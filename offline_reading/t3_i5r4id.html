    <strong>Hazards of dirty/contaminated masks</strong>
    <p><p>What do we know about the science behind fabric masks when they aren’t washed frequently enough? I have a concern about this come fall. Our school is providing two reusable masks, and I can totally see many families just using those same two masks over and over again all week long without laundering in between. This seems like its own risk, both to the wearer and other people around them, as masks get moist and the germs will breed. Am I off base here or? I feel there needs to be much better education about how to “safely” (or as safe as you can) wear masks if they’re required.</p></p>

        <p>Youre not off base, there is a lot on possible problems; basically they lose effectiveness after about 1/2 to 1 hr i think, and then there is a point where they arent even neutral, they start transmitting more pathogen than maskless. Whether or not they make people ill is going to depend on what theyre exposed to and the persons immune system. It seems what i hear about most are: eye problems/infections, skin problems, asthma complications, and exacerbating heart problems, which is inline with some of the published papers about it. I had the links to some of the papers, if i find them i'll comment them here. So they should be changed about every 2 hrs depending on the mask and circumstances, that'd be 4 masks to get thru a day, and you know that aint happening in school. To clean they should be washed with soap and water and disinfected by boiling a certain amount of time (or use another disinfection method). Not much info on resusble masks and not for large population because this is a new experiment; cloth was something military used temporarily, and it also didnt work well in the 1918 flu</p>

        <p>Regarding surgical mask contamination there is something called "Bacteria Filtration Efficacy (BFE)" This study examined mask filtration when surgical masks were used in surgical procedures where the environment is highly controlled and sterile</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1517-83822006000300003">https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1517-83822006000300003</a></p>
<p>You can see figure-1 where filtration efficiency of masks, in the controlled environment, begins dropping after 2 hours. After 3 hours use, the number of colony-forming units (CFU) of pathogens accumulated in petri-dishes was higher than not wearing masks.</p>
<p>I would expect a lower filtration efficiency outdoors or in non-sterile environments. If you decide to wear these surgical masks, I would think to replace them every couple of hours. Or somehow decontaminate them.</p>
<p>I also saw a video in another post on this sub here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5ImqqaMCd4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5ImqqaMCd4</a></p>
<p>It just demonstrates what happens with mask use with bacteria and fungus.</p>

        <p>Here's the conclusion of a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159777/">study</a> of masks used by healthcare workers:</p>
<p><em>Respiratory pathogens on the outer surface of the used medical masks may result in self-contamination. The risk is higher with longer duration of mask use (&rt; 6 h) and with higher rates of clinical contact. Protocols on duration of mask use should specify a maximum time of continuous use, and should consider guidance in high contact settings. Viruses were isolated from the upper sections of around 10% samples, but other sections of masks may also be contaminated. HCWs should be aware of these risks in order to protect themselves and people around them.</em></p>
<p>It's so unethical that they're forcing masks in school, it's a human rights abuse and an outrage.</p>
