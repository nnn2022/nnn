        <p>The data the researchers are using is from Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This is a data base storing all of the information of peculiar symptoms after being vaccinated. The reason it is important for this data base to exist is to find if the adverse situations are linked in any way. When these adverse situations occur, it is important to consider every factor that may have caused the adverse situation. If we assumed every adverse situation was linked to every drug, vaccine or new flavour of juice, everything that everyone has ever consumed would be considered a deadly threat to society. The line of thinking I'm referring to is that correlation doesn't equal to causation. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The researchers in this data analysis compare the VAERS data to the common causes of death to the relevant populations. These being the 1-3 year old population, the adult population and also note comparisons between sex and find that the leading causes of death at these age groups align with the data associated with death that does not immediately follow vaccination. This indicates that while there may be reason to suspect the vaccination caused these deaths that in fact these deaths would probably have occurred regardless of weather they were vaccinated or not. Further evidence the researchers note to support this is the trend of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) declining over the years alongside the decline of SIDS instances in the population outside of VAERS cases. This once again suggests that it was more likely these SIDS deaths were not the cause of the vaccination. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The final point I'll make about this study is that the 2149 deaths in the VAERS data base occurred out of a population of roughly 2 billion people. Even if all of these deaths were vaccine related, which they don't appear to be, that would still be 1 death per 1 million people to immunise a population from several illnesses and lead to herd immunity. Even if all of these deaths were vaccine related, 1 death per 1 million people is not only very good odds but also a much better situation to be in than the continuous spread of these diseases. I'd much rather 2149 deaths over 16 years than the several millions of deaths that would occur from every disease we can immunise ourselves from being allowed to spread over those same 16 years. It is important to know if vaccinations have their own problems but the evidence overwhelming points to that they don't. If they did, it would be worthwhile changing them in a way that resolves the issues. If they couldn't be resolved, most people would still rather have autism than measles or hepatitis. </p>
