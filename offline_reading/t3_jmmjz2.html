    <strong>My mom (50 y.) just went to 3 parties this weekend.</strong>
    <p><p>Well, I just want to tell you guys about my parents. According to everything what has been told, my mom is not only in a high risk group; she literally shouldn’t be leaving her house. </p>
<p>She’s 50 this year, she had multiple heart surgeries and constantly takes medicine for her heart. She has asthma and she often gets sore nose because of allergies. </p>
<p>My dad is half deaf as he lost 40% of his hearing ability when he was a kid. </p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t live with my parents since couple of years now (they are in Germany) but I’m so proud and happy despite of not being together and not influencing each other by our own opinions, in the end we think THE SAME. </p>
<p>My parents have legit doctors letter exempting them from wearing masks. They never wear them. My dad can’t because he has hearing buds in his ears and mask can’t be worn in that way, mom can’t because of her heart and high blood pressure. Despite of this, the last time I saw them (august, and the only time for this year thanks for our lovely travel bans and quarantine restrictions), whenever we went to shops they were kept  being bugged by staff and security. My mom once went to a shop and they didn’t want to serve her DESPITE OF a legitimate exemption. Ridiculous! </p>
<p>Germany is also imposing a lockdown this week. To live her best life, my parents and mostly my mom were partying for three freaking days. I’m 23 and I haven’t been to a party since New Year’s Eve...  Giving all of this shouldn’t my mom and dad had covid long time ago and I should just live in fear now scared I’ll be an orphan? </p>
<p>This is absolutely ridiculous, my family is a living example that even that “risk group” bullshit is just another bullshit. My “high risk group” parents have never felt better in their entire life.</p></p>

        <p>Sounds l ike your parents are choosing to life their lives rather than cower in fear.</p>
<p>The sad side effect is how many people lost their lives to loneliness or haven't seen their families.</p>

        <p>Yeah I really like my parents too haha and am super proud they have common sense! Also they are from academically historic/political background and they are just really sick when there’s an obvious robbery of our freedom. </p>
<p>And yeah, it is so sad. I couldn’t spend Easter with my family, won’t spend Christmas and honestly I don’t think next Easter can work out either. I live on my own in a foreign country and now I can see my fam only once a year apparently. This is a crime against us</p>

        <p>My grandmother has not seen her kids or grand kids since March.  She missed two of her grand kids weddings and missed her son's funeral.  The home she's in told her if she leaves she can't come back and no other home would take here.  Sadly she needs care that she can't get at our house.</p>

        <p>You know, more you’re fearful of something more likely you’re gonna get it. It’s the law of attraction or whatever. I noticed people who are most terrified of this they just keep being sick (among my friends). If ur mom does give a fck then she won’t get sick no matter how obese she could be ehh</p>

        <p>Your parents sound awesome. I've seen posts from friends in Germany, people were partying like crazy, knowing it might be their last chance. I'd rather go down swinging than hunkered up fearfully with a giant stash of toilet paper!</p>

<p>It's not total bullshit.  The high risk thing is a greater chance of a bad outcome <em>if</em> you are infected.  It says nothing about your chances of being infected.  Your chances of being hospitalized are 1 in a 1000 rather than 1 in 10,000.  </p>
<p>I applaud anyone who takes responsibility for their own health and the consequences of their actions.  But it is a fact that some people are at higher risk. That's why we should protect the most vulnerable.   Just as some people are at higher risk for cancer, and some for heart attack.</p>

        <p>You’re right there are people who should be more cautious, but it doesn’t change the fact that the whole thing is massively exaggerated making all of us giving up on our normal lives. I don’t think the chance of being hospitalised is 1 in 1000. I don’t know where you got this number from but if you’re basing it on all those numbers that media are giving then that’s wrong.</p>

        <p>That is what I call an anally extracted number.  I pulled it out of my ass.  The point is simply that some have a much higher risk. </p>
<p>If you just take in the US 9.4 million total confirmed cases and 48,500 hospitalized, that give you about 5 out of a thousand odds in general, all age groups.   So I wasn't off by that much.</p>
