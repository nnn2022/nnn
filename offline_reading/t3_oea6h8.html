    <strong>J&amp;J Jab original study - deaths in the unvaccinated control group.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't worry much about jabs - I decided I'm not getting one.</p>
<p>But it doesn't hurt to go back and revisit some of the early studies that different pharma companies submitted to the FDA / EMA.
Janssen and Janssen / Johnson &amp; Johnson was the most recent re-read.</p>
<p>FDA summary Sheet:</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/media/146304/download</p>
<p>To summarise the numbers:</p>
<p>43,783 participants, 21,895 vaccinated, 21,888 placebo
5 deaths in the placebo group, 0 deaths in the vaccinated group.
Statistically - the data can be presented two different ways. Guess which way the advertisers choose... ;)</p>
<p>1 - The vaccine prevents 100% of Covid Deaths (0 vs 5)</p>
<p>or 2 - The vaccine prevents 0.022% of Covid Deaths (5 vs 21888)</p>
<p>So the numbers show a small benefit... 0 deaths vs 5</p>
<p>But it got me thinking - what about the people dying of other causes? If you take 40,000 people, and follow them for a month, some of them will die. Because thats life.</p>
<p>Back of a napkin math calculation:</p>
<p>In 2020, the USA had a death rate of approximately 8.2 citizens per year per 1000 individuals. Therefore, in a group of 43,783 people we might expect 360 deaths. 2 equal groups, therefore we might expect 180 deaths in each group. I think the Johnson and Johnson study only reported on the subject's status at 28 days after injection. So 1 month. If we are anticipating 180 deaths in a year - might we anticipate 1/12 of that number of deaths in a month? Maybe 15 deaths in each group?</p>
<p>Its an estimate. Perhaps deaths are seasonal? Perhaps people behave less riskily when they are participating in a medical study? Perhaps 15 deaths in each group is not realistic, but we should expect a few, surely?</p>
<p>And whatever the numbers are - very importantly, <strong>we'd expect  similar number in both groups,</strong> jabbed and non jabbed.</p>
<p>So I wanted to see the data / see the statistics for deaths from "non-covid" causes</p>
<p>There is now an "Official Science Journal" write-up for the New England Journal of Medicine:</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33882225/</p>
<p>To quote:</p>
<p>&rt; three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19-related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19-related).</p>
<p>So - that made me curious!</p>
<p>Because if the group demographics were equally weighted, (i.e the same number of 85 year olds in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups) you'd expect similar background mortality in both groups.</p>
<p>But we don't.</p>
<p>We see a background death rate of almost 4 times higher in the non-
vaccinated control group compared with the vaccinated group (11 vs 3)</p>
<p>This is pretty much the same number as we see in the "Covid deaths" (5 vs 0, as opposed to 11 vs 3)</p>
<p>This is a statistical abnormality.</p>
<p>A fair test would require the two different groups to be as similar as possible, the only thing being different is the jab or no jab - then we can tell what effect the jab has. If your control group contains more vulnerable people, with other serious medical conditions, the trial data suddenly becomes a lot more questionable.</p>
<p>If the non-jabbed group is dying much faster than the jabbed group -
Then the researchers say - look more covid deaths in the non-jabbed group... that conclusion is kinda expected... because they were dying 4x faster anyway...</p>
<p>A supplementary appendix contains more data:</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544/suppl_file/nejmoa2101544_appendix.pdf</p>
<p>page 35 age distributions, page 43 comorbidities.</p>
<p>I only post this because I found it interesting... and it gets you thinking... how 1 elderly person dying in a trial conducted in a leads to american magazines and newspapers advertising 100% effective vaccines...</p>
<p>in a market worth billions and an apparent political project to reshape global society...</p></p>

        <p>You are right. Five is a small number and has no statistical relevance and any calculated "Vaccine Efficiency" out of this small sample size is to be considered irrelevant.</p>
<p>That all those five people died in the same geographical area, makes it even more questionable.</p>
<p>Dr.Fleming is pointing exactly that out in his event2021.</p>

        <p>I've looked at the Pfizer trial protocol.</p>
<p>Solicited follow up at 7 days. Thereafter unsolicited follow up ie the subjects had to contact the trial coordinators if they had side effects. Well dead people don't call back. Also the study was done in USA, SA, Argentina and Brazil- not places where healthcare databases are joined up properly- it's easy in these places for patients deaths to be missed by inefficiencies, especially if the subjects being paid were in the low socio economic bracket.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I understand what this refers to - with the studies, you innoculate, then they needed to count the number of coronavirus infections that occur afterwards in both groups. At the end of the study, that shows how effective the jab was, or wasn't.</p>
<p>&rt; Well dead people don't call back.</p>
<p>!!! you can't fault this logic !!! - I would really interested to read what you're refering to - I'll go a-hunting for it myself at some stage - but if you can link anything - very appreciated. Best regards!</p>

        <p>Good catch.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe something similar in the Pfizer Trials as well.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is: "Hey look, the placebo also works against the virus.".</p>

        <p>Thanks I did. Very first result:</p>
<p>"The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is 85% effective at preventing severe illness, and most importantly, it was 100% effective at preventing hospitalization and death among trial participants."</p>
<p>Apparently they were referencing the results of the trial where it was 100% effective in preventing hospitalization and death amongst trial participants relating to covid. </p>
<p>If all of the people in the trial over the course of the trial do not die or are not hospitalized, then... that's 100%. How else are you supposed to report that?</p>
<p>No reasonable person thinks that if they get a vaccine for anything that they're 100% safe from the disease.</p>
<p>I think it's interesting that you're spending your time trying to milk the stone of this early trial when we have a much better indicator of vaccine efficacy in real-time: the people who are self-selecting to die or be hospitalized right now because they chose not to get the vaccine. Far and away they are the ones in hospital beds. And water is wet. </p>
<p>To deny the efficacy of the vaccines at this point is just bull headed delusion. Plus the free 5G is great.</p>

<p>Why? - the supplementary data is new - published april 2021.</p>
<p>Before that we, the study had not been published outside the FDA / EMA - the data was held internally. Correct?</p>
<p>So to look at the actual trial is kinda relevant no?</p>
<p>Whats your opinion on the differences in background mortality? The control group being unequal to the test group?</p>
