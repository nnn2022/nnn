    <strong>Wouldn’t it have been common sense to advise the public to wear a mask as a precaution at the beginning of the pandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't understand the mandate on masks. Why were masks labelled as ineffective at the beginning of the pandemic but now all of a sudden they're considered the holy grail to humanities survival?</p>
<p>Those pro-conformists bellow out that masks are common sense, it's common sense to wear a mask! Well, surely from previous SARs outbreaks studies had been carried out into the effectiveness of masks/face coverings so wouldn't have been "common sense" to advise the public to wear them as a precaution at the beginning of the pandemic anyway?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4293989/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4293989/</a></p>
<p>Conclusion: Your government lied to you. So why continue to blindly follow their restrictions when this is a quite clear obvious fact. They lied to you once, they will lie to you again.</p>
<p>Those spouting that masks are common sense, how many of you wore a mask at the beginning of the pandemic? A very very very small minority. How many people are you responsible for infecting up to this point? We don't wear masks for flu season. How many people are you responsible for infecting throughout your life?</p>
<p>If the media hadn't reported on coronavirus for the past 12 months you'd have absolutely no idea that anything was even happening and your moral-spiritual compass would never have been negatively altered because what you don't know can't hurt. You'd be pondering about your existence oblivious as you do already for the rest of disease (particularly flu) and famine in the world.</p>
<p>Madness.</p>
<p>PS: Someone please give me the wearing is caring award.</p></p>

        <p>They claim it’s to help healthcare workers but they are not getting their masks from Walmart or Walgreens.  They get special shipments in bulk from the manufacturer or hospital suppliers.  They were always gonna be fine regarding masks.</p>

        <p>No, they weren't. At the start of this outbreak even hospitals like JHH in Baltimore were having to have their nurses and other employees reuse masks on a regular basis because they could not get enough of a supply of them.</p>
<p>Personally I feel that the ONLY people who need to wear masks are those working in hospitals, people with known cases of CoVid-19, and those who came into contact with those two groups.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe that. A dirty mask is worse than no mask at all because it becomes a disease vector. No health care worker with a brain would do that.</p>

        <p>I suspect in the beginning they were doing the normal thing of trying to prevent a panic, and were fully aware that it is just a cold. Then they started to notice other governments were using the panic to take extraordinary powers easily and without resistance and so more and more countries followed suit to get in on that sweet, sweet populace control.</p>

        <p>The propaganda wouldn't work if they started with draconian measures. So they trick the public with one little thing at a time and in the process you'll notice some controlled opposition. You can see it here in this sub too from time to time in comments. Someone will say now (nov 2020), he's against strict lockdowns (which destroyed already society/economy) and in favor of vaccination. And when health of the average John Doe deteriorates from drugging, he will blame the old vaccine, in favor of some new drug or a new  set of restrictions. And so forth. It's calculated.</p>
<p>Use of masks as part of lifestyle damages health. So I don't think there is much discuss about it. Anyone who thinks he physically performs better in his normal life, with a masked-on vs not masked, well, he's lying. It doesn't take much to understand that it affects your respiratory.</p>

        <p>If the advice on previous epidemics/pandemics had been to do so, then yes. But the sea change in opinion in 2020 is that <strong>you</strong> are responsible for <strong>my</strong> health. That was the turning point. Everything that has been done in response to this viral spread has hinged upon that one erroneous assumption.</p>

        <p>I think there were many things at play during the beginning of the pandemic and just before it was declared. Based on evidence/observations the stance on masks evolved greatly.</p>
<p>Here is a timeline for you:</p>
<p>On Jan 10th the WHO recommended in their initial <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/332447/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC-2020.1-eng.pdf">Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected (pdf warning)</a> </p>
<p>&rt;Offer medical mask for suspected nCoV infection for those who can tolerate it </p>
<p>They also recommended that all family or close contacts wear a mask and isolate as well.</p>
<p>On January 29th, WHO published their <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/330987">Advice on the use of masks</a></p>
<p>&rt;Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019-nCoV, in affected areas. however, the use of a mask <strong>alone</strong> is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be  adopted. If masks are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand hygiene and other IPC measures...</p>
<p>&rt; Wearing medical masks when not indicated may cause unnecessary cost, procurement burden and create a false sense of security that can lead to neglecting other essential measures such as hand hygiene practices. Furthermore, using a mask incorrectly may hamper its effectiveness to reduce the risk of transmission.</p>
<p>On February 14th, WHO published in their <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/331004">Recommendations for mass gatherings</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;information that wearing a face mask is recommended for participants who have respiratory symptoms (for example, cough); it is not recommended for healthy participants</p>
<p>On April 6th, WHO updated their stance regarding healthy individuals and mask wearing in their <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/331693">Advice on the use of masks...</a></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of info in this release here are some of the highlights:</p>
<p>&rt;  Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including COVID-19. <strong>However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted.</strong> (their emphasis)</p>
<p>&rt;There is limited evidence that wearing a medical mask by healthy individuals in the households or among contacts of a sick patient, or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a preventive measure. However, there is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection with  respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt;The use of medical masks in the community may create a false sense of security, with neglect of other essential measures, such as hand hygiene 
 practices and physical distancing, and may lead to touching the face under the masks and under the eyes, result in unnecessary costs, and take masks away from those in health care who need them most, especially when masks are in short supply. </p>
<p>WHO on "Advice to decision makers on the use of masks for healthy people in community settings" April 6, 2020</p>
<p>&rt;The wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks. WHO offers the following advice to decision makers so they apply a risk-based approach.</p>
<p>I'll paraphrase their risk based approach it evaluates the <strong>purpose</strong> of masks use; prevent an infected person from spreading or protecting a healthy person. The <strong>risk of exposure</strong> to potentially infected people. How <strong>vulnerability</strong> the population is, the <strong>setting</strong> of the population, the <strong>feasibility</strong> of obtaining masks and the <strong>types</strong> of masks.</p>
<p>&rt;potential advantages of the use of mask by healthy people in the community setting include reducing potential exposure risk from infected person during the “pre-symptomatic” period and stigmatization of individuals wearing mask for source control. </p>
<p>But still they are more concerned with the vulnerabilities/disadvantages of masks use, including self contamination, false sense of security, and mask shortages.</p>
<p>This guidance was again updated on June 5th. </p>
<p>WHO - <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/332293">Advice on the use of masks</a> - June 5, 2020</p>
<p>&rt;However, taking into account the available studies evaluating pre- and asymptomatic transmission, a growing compendium of observational evidence on the use of masks by the general public in several countries, individual values and preferences, as well as the difficulty of physical distancing in many contexts, WHO has updated its guidance to advise that to prevent COVID-19 transmission effectively in areas of community transmission, governments should encourage the general public to wear masks in specific situations and settings as part of a comprehensive approach to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission.</p>
<p>I hope you are starting to noticing a trend here, they are constantly updating and evolving their guidance based on scientific evidence/observations not on restricting or controlling the masses. At the beginning of the pandemic they predicted that mask use by untrained people would have a negative affect, just look how much was published about proper hand hygiene back in January/February if half the population is too stupid to wash their hands properly do we want everyone using masks improperly. As events progressed and new evidence surfaced they changed their stance why is this so hard to accept.</p>

        <p>You are conflating WHO advise with government mask mandates. People here are primarily complaining about what governments have imposed, not what the WHO has said, and nothing in the scientific literature or the WHO recommendations logically translates to infringing on people's liberty, forcing people to wear masks outside, or imposing fines for people who don't wear masks.</p>
