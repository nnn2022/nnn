    <strong>Good way to shut down the covid tyranny idiots</strong>
    <p><p>Say this to them "Imagine someone so selfish and arrogant that they demanded others give up their livelihood, generationally owned/operated mom and pop shops, their children's education, their children's access to mental health support (70% of American children get mental health help trough schools), their children's access to school meals (some large percent of children rely on the school),  forcing people to wear face diapers, forcing people to take experimental "vaccines", etc. all so that they don't get a slightly worse than normal cold. Then inform them of the actual survival rate. I genuinely "woke" two people up by saying this.</p></p>

        <p>Or "but if it only saves one life". I guess it doesn't matter how many lives get ruined or how many young people kill themselves because they lost everything. Or how many cancers weren't diagnosed on time. It's just not important.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Just like all those epeople you're using to advance your ideology died with coof in their systems, even though less than 6% had it as their primary cause of death. </p>
<p>We need to treat oxygen the same way as the coof. If you die within 30 days of testing positive for oxygen, you were killed by oxygen, even if you are 105 years old. And we need to start testing everybody. If we start seeing lots of people test positive for oxygen, we lock down the planet again.</p>

        <p>People have pointed this out on the internet time and time again and the response is always something along the lines of "wow, how could anybody be this stupid". Not sure if they know why they're "supposed" to disagree and think it's too obvious to bother mentioning or whether they actually don't know but want to say the "right" thing and be on the "right" side.</p>
<p>My experience with saying this to people in real life is that they agree with me but retain their original views, thus ending up with conflicting views but they don't seem to notice.</p>

        <p>"Face diapers" is a good one tho! Funny!</p>
<p>But for real, this "slighty worse than normal cold" of yours is actually killing people, in MILLIONS globally! It's a serious virus and you have to take it seriously!</p>
<p>The only initial problem of why we HAD that high death rate to begin with is because of 2 things:</p>
<p>1/- people didn't act fast enough to start working on preventive measures when covid began, it was only when people started dying in masses that it was taken as seriously as it is today.</p>
<p>2/- everything got to do with covid became politicised,  because it just HAD to for some dumb reason.</p>
<p>Its fine to be sceptic about the success or side effects of the vaccine, its NOT fine to deny the EXISTENCE and the DANGERS of covid-19</p>

        <p>So we're not allowed to spread awareness of a deadly virus (that keeps mutating btw) that just so happens to be contagious that WAS and STILL is killing people in masses GLOBALLY and not spread awareness about it + the necessary safety precautions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and other people? Noted, my apologies! </p>
<p>How stupid of me of being a decent human being, how dare I, A FILTHY MONSTER, have a little itty bitty of human decency towards my fellow human beings...</p>
<p>I'll dig up my grave while I keep politicizing the virus, that'll help me satisfy my never ending amount of ego I have to basically hold society back.</p>
