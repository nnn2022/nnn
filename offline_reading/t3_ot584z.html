    <strong>I just wanna say that I'm so glad this sub exists.</strong>
    <p><p>(Sorry, ended up ranting for longer than I expected. TLDR; I have faith in humanity again and I wish we could all meet up someplace and have a good old time.) </p>
<p>Honestly, this sub is a bright spot in a dim world. So many people here have had this overwhelming feeling of loneliness over the last year and a half, and it can't be stated how great it is to know that you're not alone. </p>
<p>I'm not a gushy person, this is not my style, but God damn does it warm my heart that people from so many different countries and walks of life can find such agreement in that their collective government is an irresponsible, megalomanic fraud that only ever acts to secure more power over its people. In the coming days and years I believe we're likely to see even more change to our lives and the world around us, and we'll likely drift even further away from the common consensus cult. Normally, that would mean even more loneliness, as we're incessantly bombarded with retorts to statements that we didn't even make by everyone around us. But I'm glad that there exists a community of tens of thousands of faceless Reddit accounts that exhibit more relatable human characteristics than most people I interact with irl.</p>
<p>As we lose our teachers, celebrities, leaders, representatives, everyone we're supposed to trust, as we're constantly talked down to by these people, demonized and outcasted for daring to question their authority, I can relax a little, knowing that I'm not the only one in my position. 
Things we're getting bleak out there, from 2016 to now there hadn't been a break for anyone in the middle. It felt like walking down a crowded street during a snowstorm and getting kicked and spat on by every pedestrian that walked past you. Common sense was inverted in all things, everything was inspected and scrubbed clean of anything that wasn't sterilized propaganda, and anyone that didn't outride bow down to the glory of political correctness was ostracized as genuine threat to society.</p>
<p>I kept my mouth shut at work, carefully taking steps not to out myself as a free-thinker, watching in silence as those around me laughed and cheered at news that fellow free-thinkers were fired, harassed, and outright had acts of violence done unto them. It was so relentless, it would wear down on the psyche. </p>
<p>"is it me? Am I just not getting it? Am I actually crazy?"</p>
<p>I would think to myself as my resolve plummeted. </p>
<p>But thank fucking Christ I found you guys. You guys are like a fountain oasis in the Arabian desert. Here I can find people from California shaking virtual hands with people from Texas, Americans, French, British, Scottish, Irish, German, Vietnamese, etc people venting in agreement half a decade of censored and completely justified frustration. Here I'm not called crazy for pointing out the obvious, hell, I <em>don't</em> have to be the guy to point it out in the first place. </p>
<p>Man, I wish we could all meet up for some burning man type festival, except with freedom. We'll shoot guns and drink and just bond over how much we don't trust the government, ANY government, because they all showed their true colors just now. Anyway, thanks for reading my 2am rant, I promise I'll read yours in return.</p></p>

        <p>They <em>want</em> you to feel isolated and alone in your scepticism.  There's psychological strength in numbers - they know that better than anyone.  The thing is, they're probably going to take this sub down sooner than later.  When they do, just remember that you are not alone, and never were.</p>

        <p>There's only one thing I agree on with the corrupt global politicians...</p>
<p>We need a Great Reset,</p>
<p>A great reset of everyone's human rights, a great reset of the propagandist media we've been bullied by for the last 10 years, a great reset of the brainwashed young minds co-opted by the media in public schools, a great reset to bring back family, community, friends, and different opinions, a great reset of the mega-trillion dollar massive welfare and tax spending the global government wasted the last 30 years, a great reset of elections finally not being stolen by the global non-elected bureaucrats, a great reset of thriving social communities replacing soulless suburbs and social media (which is not social), a great reset of health and wellness with a citizen tax on propagandist mega corporations like McDonald's / Wal-Mart / Amazon / Apple.</p>

This sub is just pumping out lies and half truths that will make you believe the opposite of what is true, it's the virus that will get you sick not the vaccine.
