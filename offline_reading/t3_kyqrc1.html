    <strong>Anyone else suspicious about Zhong ShanShan?</strong>
    <p><p>If you don’t know who Zhong ShanShan is; he is the richest man in Asia. And honestly, I doubt he would have earned that title if this plandemic never happened. Before COVID he had a net worth of only 2 billion. Now, it’s around 93 billion. Yep, you read the right, his net worth is now around 46 times higher than it was less than a year ago. I did some digging into who the hell this person is. Unsurprisingly, he is the founder of China’s biggest pharmacy. The pharmacy in question is called “Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy”. <a href="http://www.ystwt.cn/">Here is their website </a>. </p>
<p>Right when you click on that link, you’ll be met with paragraph explain how they’re leading the way in Infectious Disease Diagnostics. In this paragraph, they mention of being involved with Vaccines and COVID tests on a global scale. Now, if you know anything about the COVID test, they’re wildly inaccurate. I believe a papaya tested positive for COVID once. I’m still trying to learn more about this man but I already came to the conclusion that Zhong has some sort of involvement in the spread of these lockdowns. There’s no way he has gotten this rich without at least a sprinkle of corruption. I’m surprised he’s not being talked about more. I searched for his name in r/conspiracy and there wasn’t any posts about him. </p>
<p>But hey, I’ve found this one interesting fact about Zhong. He dropped out of school at the age of 12 during the 6th grade.</p></p>
