    <strong>More proof that doomers don't actually care about health but only want to be proven right (the true selfish ones)</strong>
    <p><p>Notice how whenever there is any good news about the opened states with little to no restrictions, they try their absolute best to justify why and even go as far to say "they're hiding the deaths" (despite it being disproven plenty times), which is ironic since they sound more like conspiracy theorists than we ever did.</p>
<p>In fact, whenever there are events that take place, they seem SO EXCITED to see a "spike" in cases/deaths (think, super bowl from florida or texas reopening), these posts even get awards (which means some are spending real life money, they are that happy) + thousands of upvotes - and then when that inevitably doesn't happen, its memory-holed or they pretend they never said it in the first place, or they go ahead and insult the governors with ad hominem attacks when its good news. They're even ignoring the ACTUAL bad governors, like Cuomo from New York.</p>
<p>Let that sink in. We are not the selfish ones. We want things to be opened, after seeing Florida/Texas/South Dakota's success, for kids to see real faces, for loved ones to not stay isolated and fearful of each other, for the economy to thrive like the opened states. That is not selfish, unlike what I've described above, where they are actively hoping for the virus to be deadlier than it is, so that they can continue their hermit lives that they enjoyed throughout the year. </p>
<p>If this was said to be a truly deadly threat, shouldn't they be happy that these areas actively disprove that? Instead, they react the exact opposite. It's mind-boggling, and shows the true stance of these "so-called caring" people.</p>
<p>Here's a perfect example: https://np.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCirclejerk/comments/lsb0m4/lmaoooo_maybe_theyre_finally_getting_the_memo/</p>
<p>"The worst part is the people who DON'T get covid".... are... are you fucking kidding me?! That's the WORST part?</p></p>

        <p>Fucking spot on. Seen so many posts where people are practically PRAYING for a spike in Covid cases or for someone to get the virus. Fucking shameful, and these are the people who call us the bad guys...</p>

        <p>Also notice how some of them treat the virus like its some badass supervillain, the wording they use on Twitter or even in some subreddits as well. Never happens with others like the Spanish flu, ebola, etc. </p>
<p>Totally not a cult /s</p>

        <p>People are hellbound on following authority. There must be some kind of brainwashing going on. Well, I know there is. The sheer amount of articles one reads that say 'experts believe this' is staggering. And has been for years and years. Same with the breathtakingly ignorant idea that is 'scientific consensus'. A scientific fallacy and even a contradictio in terminis. Consensus doesn't matter and absolutely shouldn't matter in science, doing everything to go against dogmatic consensus should though.</p>
<p>This together with cognitive dissonance creates quite the cocktail. I had a guy make the exact same argument as Fauci in some hearing when asked about the evidence on states with and without restrictions like masks. That there was no difference if there was, states without restrictions did better<br>
They both said; that is because no one follows the restrictions.</p>
<p>Like what? Sorry? You are smart guys, this isn't hard!</p>

        <p>Just look at the psychos in every country, state, and city sub that post the daily covid propaganda. They're so powerless that they <em>want</em> to be scared. They've followed a script their entire lives;  why stop now.</p>

        <p>A doomer was complaining his mom was going out for frivolous reasons like the supermarket and visiting nail salons even though she was fully vaccinated. I thought he was afraid his mom would still catch the disease but nope, it was because he hadn't gotten the vaccine yet and he was worried about himself.  </p>
<p>So yeah they're really selfish</p>
