        <p>this is a weird post my friend - maybe the logic makes sense to you but not to me - theres lots of non-lgbt people that probably shouldn't give blood based on their personal behavior - this is a gross overgeneralization - I don't like the equivalence here - its weird.</p>

        <p>I’m totally with you. There’s a lot of risky behavior that should also prevent you from giving blood. IV drug users, for one. My point though is that a) if we are talking straight about <em>the science</em> a gay man (or for the sake of whatever,  men that have sex with other men) has an increased risk of say, getting HIV. More so than a straight man, even when taking into account a promiscuous and non-safe man having sex with multiple women. If we are going to judge their right or ability to give blood by the same standards we judge who should or shouldn’t get the vaccine, they should be banned from ever donating blood and them lying about it to do so should be a criminal offense. </p>
<p>For the sake of transparency I AM against people with increased risk for blood borne diseases (men who have sex with men, iv drug users, promiscuous heterosexual men and women) giving blood but have nothing against gay people. I chose this argument because most of the people supporting mandatory vaccination would straight up shoot up HIV+ blood before daring to say a man who has anal sex with ten different men a week probably shouldn’t donate blood that will go to a cancer patient on immunosuppressants c</p>

        <p>&rt;Asking them gently not to give blood -but feel free to express your sexuality however you’d we fit!- is a science backed risk reduction protocol.</p>
<p>Based on outdated science back from the AIDS epidemic in the 80s.  Non-heterosexual people who are monogamous and/or use protection are not higher risk for bloodborne diseases.</p>

        <p>Your saying that people who support equal treatment are just virtue signaling at the expense of safety.  That is flat out untrue.  Not allowing people to donate blood based on outdated evidence also reduces the amount of blood products available.  There would be far fewer shortages if these rules were overturned.</p>

        <p>If both men practice safe sex or monogamy, then the risk is the same.  If the hetero man is having unprotected sex as part of an extramarital affair, then he's at risk for disease.  Yet, there's no question about promiscuity for heterosexuals.</p>
<p>The info assumes homosexuals are promiscuous and don't use protection.  This is an outdated assumption, and any study that uses this info isn't accurate.  I don't care if it is the CDC.  It isn't like they've proven themselves reliable as of late.</p>

        <p>I agree, the risk is there for both groups. That said you have to make rules for the generality of the groups. </p>
<p>Studies show that AS A GROUP homosexual men tend to be more promiscuous and carry a much greater HIV risk. </p>
<p>Of course that a straight man who has unprotected sex with truck stop lizards every day will carry a greater risk than a homosexual man in a long term monogamous relationship.  And I’m not even getting on how the chances of a man getting HIV from an infected woman is orders of magnitude lower than a man getting HIV from an infected man.</p>

        <p>It’s proven that anal sex in general can cause more stds, regardless of gender (man having anal with girl is just the same). However anal sex is more common with gay people. even lgbtq members talk about it and put out websites to make people more aware of the topic. If a fact is a fact, then that is the fucking fact. We should learn to deal with reality instead of pretending it’s not there, then we’re hit with problems before we can realize. I have nothing against gay people but everyone should just be safe an aware of possibilities before going into something.</p>

        <p>Gladly, vaccines don't need much introduction, they prevent many diseases and yadda yadda, can lead to the erradication of a disease or even prevent you from developing a disease even if you already have the virus(for example hepatitis D, it doesn't start until you get hepatitis B since it has to connect to the B type in order to replicate, so naturally, if you vaccinate against hepatitis B you are safe from D), and it's not like there aren't exceptions to vaccinations, there are vaccines that pregnant women can't take, or if you have any of a set list of conditions that may affect how your body reacts to the vaccine, like egg allergy.</p>
<p>And it's not like only gay people have HIV, and every time you donate blood, they do tests to assure you don't have some diseases, including HIV. The healthcare system learned that they must take these precautions after many people got contaminated with hepatitis because of blood transfusions in the 70's~90's. So why should homossexual be forbidden from donating blood? There's a whole procedure that gatekeeps contaminated blood from entering the system, so it ends up just being a waste.</p>

        <p>These are people who don't have a disease.  It's based solely on risk assessment figure that are over 30 years old.  It would be more like not being allowed to donate because your grandparent had lymphoma.  So, you might have it and not know it.  The same BS behind the asymptomatic transmission of Covid lie.</p>
