    <strong>Klaus Schwab's Family History in Nazi Germany</strong>

<p>Horrific Nazi crimes against humanity took place in Ravensburg. On 1 January 1934, the “<a href="https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1933-1938/law-for-the-prevention-of-offspring-with-hereditary-diseases">Law for the Prevention of Hereditary Diseases</a>”  came into force in Nazi Germany, meaning people with diagnosed  illnesses such as dementia, schizophrenia, epilepsy, hereditary  deafness, and various other mental disorders, could be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22476743/">legally forcibly sterilised</a>.  In the Ravensburg City Hospital, today called Heilig-Geist Hospital,  forced sterilisations were carried out beginning in April 1934. By 1936,  sterilisation was the most performed medical procedure in the municipal  hospital.</p>
<p>In the pre-war years of the 1930s leading up to the German annexation  of Poland, Ravensburg’s Escher-Wyss factory, now managed directly by  Klaus Schwab’s father, <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;tl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;u=https://www.bernerzeitung.ch/schweiz/der-superidealistische-weltverbesserer/story/19150298">Eugen Schwab</a>, continued to be the biggest employer in Ravensburg. Not only was the factory a major employer in the town, but Hitler’s own <a href="https://www.zvab.com/Nationalsozialistischen-Musterbetriebe-19371938-1939-B%C3%A4nde-Bayreuth/22607020525/bd">Nazi party awarded</a> the Escher-Wyss Ravensburg branch the title of “<a href="https://archive.org/details/0123DAFDeutscheMusterbetriebeHistorischesArchiv/page/n1/mode/2up?q=escher">National Socialist Model Company</a>”  while Schwab was at the helm. The Nazis were potentially wooing the  Swiss company for cooperation in the coming war, and their advances were  eventually reciprocated.</p>

<h2>The Founding of the World Economic Forum</h2>
<p>In 1970, the young upstart, Klaus Schwab wrote to the European  Commission and asked for help in setting up a “non-commercial think tank  for European business leaders”. The European Commission would sponsor  the event as well, sending French politician Raymond Barre to act as the  forum’s “intellectual mentor”. Raymond Barre, who was at that time  European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, would later go  on to become French PM and would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/world/europe/27barre.html?ref=world">be accused of</a> making anti-Semitic comments while in office.</p>
<p>So, in 1970, Schwab left Escher Wyss to organise a two-week business  managerial conference. In 1971, the first meeting of the World Economic  Forum – then called the European Management Symposium – convened in  Davos, Switzerland. Around 450 participants from 31 countries would take  part in Schwab’s first European Management Symposium, mostly made up of  managers from various European companies, politicians, and US  academics. The project was recorded as organised by Klaus Schwab and his  secretary Hilde Stoll who, later the same year, would become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/business/davos-world-economic-forum.html">Klaus Schwab’s wife</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Since the founding of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab has  become one of the most powerful people in the world and his Great Reset  has made it more important than ever to scrutinize the man sitting on  the globalist throne.</p>
<p>Given his prominent role in the far-reaching effort to transform  every aspect of the existing order, Klaus Schwab’s history was difficult  to research. When you start to dig into the history of a man like  Schwab, who sits aloft other shadowy elite movers and shakers, you soon  find lots of information has been hidden or removed. Klaus is somebody  who wants to stay hidden in the shadowy corners of society and who will  only allow the average person to see a well-presented construct of their  chosen persona.</p>
<p>Is the real Klaus Schwab a kindly old uncle figure wishing to do good  for humanity, or is he really the son of a Nazi collaborator who used  slave labour and helped the Nazi efforts to obtain the first atomic  bomb? Is Klaus the honest business manager who we should trust to create  a fairer society and workplace for the common man, or is he the person  who helped push Sulzer Escher-Wyss into a technological revolution that  led to its role in the illegal creation of nuclear weapons for South  Africa’s racist apartheid regime? The evidence I have looked at does not  suggest a kindly man, but rather a member of a wealthy, well-connected  family that has a history of helping create weapons of mass destruction  for aggressive, racist governments.</p>

<p>TLDR: It is utterly remarkable the subtle similarities between the assembling of the Nazi Regime and the World Economic Forum. The article is highly worth reading.</p></p>

        <p>It used to be common to refer to these global organizations as their true form, the fourth reich.  Wonder why that came out of fashion.</p>

        <p>I like this. To me, it’s really difficult to tell whether Klaus is just the world’s most influential book club organizer, for lack of better terms, or a cartoonish villain with a plan for world domination.</p>

        <p>The guest paper on Miles' site has the best exposé on Schwab that I've read. He comes from old Swiss nobility going back hundreds of years: http://mileswmathis.com/schwab.pdf</p>
