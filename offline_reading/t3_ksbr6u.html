        <p>Online schools are one of our best hopes. The people no longer need to send their kids to brainwashed public schools. We need better online education. I say forget the accreditation process. With an amazon account and some determination, kids would be better educated than they would at any public school. </p>
<p>I want to see more freedom loving, pro western culture online schools.</p>

        <p>yeah I guess this was more for my own personal needs. I personally don't like the role technology, esp. The internet , has in my life right now. I have A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT not to have the government FORCE the internet on me. It seems to take a big bite out of most people's lives. Its his dad that's more worried about formal accreditation than I am. I bought 25$ worth of books on thriftbooks and honestly ,thats enough. Math, language arts, social studies (history/civics), science , foreign language. Literally bought used textbooks for $5 apiece. But whatever . I just wanted to share</p>

        <p>Two of my boys were pretty let down by the system long before this happened. We tried online public school and it was just shit. We ended up just fighting everyday and if there were tech issues just forget it. I now fully homeschool my three boys, it doesn’t look like what people imagine. They aren’t sitting perfect at some desk slaving away with pencil to paper. We get to choose what we want to learn aside from math, which I have to say I’m relearning right along with them. It’s freeing, actually, now half a year in to see my kids happier, and I believe learning and retaining more than they ever did at school. Especially since the stress of “getting into trouble” is gone. The one thing right now that’s heartbreaking is friendship, especially for my oldest. My youngest has neighbors to play with. It would be solved if the fucking government didn’t shut down all their extra curricular options. </p>
<p>Keep going and stay strong.</p>

        <p>I hear you. It is crazy that many have been forced to get internet. I hadn't thought of that. </p>
<p>I'm hoping this all sparks a wave of new and better online schools and more homeschooling.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing</p>

        <p>Honestly I would’ve dropped out of high school if it wasn’t for online school. I was so depressed at the time and online school had a more lenient schedule to help me “breathe”.</p>
