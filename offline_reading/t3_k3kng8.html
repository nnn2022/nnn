        <p>11/18/20 Danish mask study that JAMA, NEJM &amp; Lancet REFUSED to publish was just published in Annals of Internal Medicine. The difference in rates of infection between the control group (no masks) and medical mask wearers was 2.1% vs 1.8%, respectively.</p>
<p>Odds Ratio CI was 0.54 to 1.23, P=0.33.</p>
<p>No significant difference.</p>
<p>In the largest randomized controlled trial to date w/ 6,024 subjects, medical masks were NOT effective protection against infection.

The likely advantages of the use of masks by healthy people

"• making people feel they can play a role in contributing to
stopping spread of the virus;"
"• reminding people to be compliant with other measures
(e.g., hand hygiene, not touching nose and mouth).
However, this can also have the reverse effect (see

        <p>The problem is that the science is far from settled. There are studies that come to all sorts of different conclusions. But what is being said by the media and politicians is that there is an overwhelming consensus, but that just isn't true. There is some science that supports masks, but there is plenty that doesn't. And there is way more real world data that doesn't support masks being effective. Ultimately the science just isn't strong enough to justify mandating masks.</p>

        <p>It’s just like every few months there is a report about a study that says, “Drinking wine is sooo good for you!” And then in three months one that says, “Any amount of alcohol ever can lead to such and such terrible problems”. Then again a study about how it’s good for you, and so on. </p>
<p>And yet, with all of that conflicting info, people still manage to (mostly) make their own informed decisions about how much and how often they drink, if at all.</p>

        <p>Are you making the argument that claims of the health benefits of wine consumption and claims of means to mitigate disease transmission are comparable? The outcomes of accepting or rejecting the former affect but 1 person. You are in good faith trying to say the same about covid transmission?</p>

        <p>I have. Overwhelmingly it's 'in perfect conditions, in the short term, we studied this material and it filtered shit". In the covid cohorts in this study, the n= was so fucking low that it should have not even been done.</p>

        <p>So dismiss all the other science that clearly states the opposite becasue all of a sudden, despite decades of research, 2020 produces a couple of convenient  study's that aligns with the narrative...I would never have thought...lol....I saw the same contradiction when they were pushing for medical staff to wear masks years ago..Magically 1 study appeared at the same time which concluded and recommended masks for health care workers, again, despite every other study. </p>
<p>You want the pandemic so bad, you will disregard all former science and facts in place of manufactured science which supports your belief..</p>

        <p>I mean I never said dismiss any research... I said we should discuss what is actually going on in these studies if we are going to claim to be critical thinkers. But go off about number of studies and such I guess.</p>

        <p>I didn't read anything that involved "discussing" in this particular thread. However, when re-reading it could sound like you are inferring the, objectional discussion. So my bad if i misconstrued. Admittedly it has become infuriating for me when I see the only evidence to support the Pandemic and it's measures are a result of post 2020 studies, which formerly showed contrasting or inconclusive results, but NOW they know..</p>
<p>Again If I completely took your statement out of context I sincerely apologize.</p>

        <p>Actually, I question how much seatbelts do help. I had an accident at the start of this month, and the one injury my passenger and I received came from our seatbelts. Hers cut her stomach and mine left harsh abrasions on my shoulder/upper chest that took two weeks to heal and were painful to touch.</p>
<p>My car gets hit by a bus, takes out a street sign, and the only thing that hurts my passenger and me is the thing designed to not do that?</p>

        <p>In this case, the seatbelts are likely what stopped you from getting <em>more</em> hurt. </p>
<p>The bigger thing here is that driving is not a 'right', it's actually quite dangerous in the best of conditions.</p>

        <p>Seat belts were optional in cars for decades before becoming legally mandated as installed accessories.  Then, it was decades more before their use was mandated.</p>
<p>In the interim, there were lots and LOTS of scientific studies showing the efficacy of seat belts.  They <em>all</em> showed that, at a macro level, seat belts provided a net benefit to society.  So, after careful research, their use was legislated.</p>
<p>Masks?  Yeah, none of that.</p>
