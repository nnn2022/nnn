    <strong>Theory about climate change, India's case surge, and the possible end of COVID [long post, TLDR at the end].</strong>
    <p><p>The COVID-19 "crisis" may well be coming to a close. I say that it "may" because with everything we've been through, we must take all info with a grain of salt. Obviously it's not over 'til it's over. That being said, I intend to present my findings and theories.  </p>
<p>On 04/13, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas released <a href="https://www.projectveritas.com/news/part-1-cnn-director-admits-network-engaged-in-propaganda-to-remove-trump/">Part 1 of his exposé on CNN.</a> in which an undercover journalist interviewed CNN Technical Director Charlie Chester. In the interview, Chester explained that CNN's agenda during the 2020 election was to "get Trump out of office." That's obviously a no-brainer. But he went on to say that since that agenda is complete, and because there is "COVID fatigue", the network will pivot to fearmongering about climate change. Chester surmised that CNN President Jeff Zucker has been discussing the game plan with "his council".  </p>
<p>This leak doesn't seem to be hot air either. On 04/20, just <em>one day</em> after the COVID vaccine was <a href="https://www.axios.com/covid-vaccine-eligibility-all-states-2d842548-892a-40c1-91a6-07ae9a3b0ca1.html">made available</a> to all adults, the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/earth-warming-emissions-come-roaring-back-from-pandemic">IEA released a report</a> forecasting a "dire" 5% increase in Carbon emissions in 2021. The most notable part is that this increase is due to our economic recovery from the pandemic. This is a logical course of action if you wanted to "transition" from one crisis to another; predicating the new crisis as being a result of the old one. Potentially, we will see a decrease in COVID outrage and a bigger focus on climate change. Eventually climate change will eclipse COVID as the "new issue". Chester said as much: "It will taper off to a point that it's not a problem anymore." What's more, if you don't have COVID coverage anymore, how do you expect to convince people to follow guidelines or get vaccinated? Everyone would revert back to normal fast.  </p>
<p>We're getting ahead of ourselves, though. The preceding simply isn't enough evidence for the supposed "end of COVID," and honestly I don't have full confidence in my theory because it feels like this will never end. But I will press on. In the CNN exposé, Chester mentioned how Jeff Zucker was speaking to "his council" to discuss what the network's next moves were. But who was he talking to and what was the nature of these discussions?  </p>
<p>Well, when I first saw those stories about the IEA report, they weren't coming <em>just</em> from CNN. They were coming from several outlets, among them Reuters, NBC, and PBS. You may as well say that the <em>media as a whole</em> is making the pivot. And if you're in the know, you know <em>who</em> runs the media.  </p>
<p>Given these people not only run the media, but also the government, and considering their tendency to stick together agenda-wise, I will posit a theory. In these discussions Zucker had, they didn't have just "profits" or "ratings" in mind. If you think the only thing news media is after is ratings, you are gravely mistaken. The media has the godlike power to shape public opinion. It's one of, if not the most important assets in a totalitarian state. In our Capitalist system run by money (which itself has great manipulative power), it's either ignorant or disingenuous to think <em>no one</em> has seized the opportunity to use the media for their own agenda.  </p>
<p>...And that's what they've done. For a seemingly "random" shift over to climate change, the establishment seems to be in lock step with them. On 04/23, Biden took part in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/22/politics/white-house-climate-summit/index.html">climate townhall on CNN.</a> And more humorously, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-56851915">Greta Thunberg</a> spoke to the House Environmental Subcommittee on 04/22.  </p>
<p>I mean think about it. If you're seriously rolling out the child who obviously serves as an appeal to emotion, then the only conclusion is that you're priming the public for something. And it seems like they're priming us for another season of end times prophecies that the world will end in 10 years, and the only solution is to listen to the petulant child, drive less cars, and stop eating meat. Can't wait!  </p>
<p>I don't think they're done laying the groundwork though. We would be left with our heads spinning if climate change became a crisis overnight. The transition must be gradual. As of right now, the climate crisis seems to be brewing underneath, similar to how the Coronavirus festered in the news from Jan-Feb of 2020. A non-critical media viewer isn't gonna think much of the random climate stories, but as we speak they're internalizing them bit by bit. You could say the stories are "foreshadowing" to a big twist later on, which I'll come back to later.  </p>
<p>Here's where I diverge from everyone else in the COVID-critical camp. We're all worried about a future police state where vaccines are mandatory in order to enjoy a modicum of freedom. Personally I find this theory silly. Unlike most Libertarians, I don't think the government is the problem. The real problem is the private sector, who exercise power by brainwashing people into becoming braindead, status-seeking wage slaves who just love consuming the latest products, i.e. the perfect economic units. They do indeed want us to "own nothing and be happy," but I fail to see where forced vaccinations play into this.  </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, forced injections and vaccines required to enter Walmart just seems too obvious. It puts a target on the establishment's head, and more importantly it sounds <em>exactly</em> like a Hollywood cyberpunk dystopia. See, those movies are <em>intended</em> to instill an idea of what "dystopia" means, and since you don't see those things in real life, it's supposed proof that you're free.  </p>
<p>Nah, the real exercise of power is the corporate sector's instilling of trendy Liberal values (e.g. BLM, LGBT), while simultaneously <em>convincing</em> people that they came up with these ideas on their own. They constantly brainwash you, and the government's role is to gaslight you by saying "That's just the free market at work. This is what people <em>want,</em> and who are <em>we</em> to stop them?"  </p>
<p>On top of this, it just doesn't seem feasible to enforce measures as dystopian as a vaccine caste system and a subsequent Holocaust of the unvaccinated. It also seems unlikely considering the things I'm about to get into.  </p>
<p>As of late, it looks like the vaccination campaign is unraveling in some way. There's something counterintuitive brewing with the vaccines, and that's their reporting that the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/21/health/us-coronavirus-wednesday/index.html">initial wave of vaccinations is beginning to decline.</a> Media outlets are explaining that most of the braindead masses have gotten their shots, and that it's going to be more difficult to get the "vaccine hesitant" crowd inoculated. On 04/25, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-25/when-will-u-s-vaccination-be-done-we-re-getting-closer">Bloomberg's Drew Armstrong predicted</a> that vaccination would be less hyped, and would begin to look a bit more like "everyday" vaccinations like the flu shot, e.g. getting immunized at a doctor's checkup after they see you're not up to date. Funnily enough, he likens early vaccination to seeing a hot new movie in theaters, and everyone else as streaming the movie months later. Just that status-seeking consumerist dystopia at work. This prediction is also corroborated by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who I'll mention later.  </p>
<p>There's one last oddity at work, which I'm still seeking to understand, but I feel that this ties into everything I've said thus far. That thing is India. In the past couple days, story after story has been published about India's suffering from record surges--a staggering <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/26/india-reports-record-new-covid-cases-for-fifth-straight-day.html">350,000 cases per day.</a> Horrifying accounts of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-india-56864789">country's hospitals</a> are percolating throughout the internet. The situation is so intense, in fact, that some outlets are naming India as the "epicenter" of the pandemic now. And there is, effectively, an element of truth here. Not only are we seeing a lot of talk, but action is being taken: just yesterday the US and some European countries <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-24/u-s-states-relaunch-j-j-shot-after-10-day-halt-virus-update">pledged to send aid to India.</a> Not only that, but the US may send unused vaccines there too. If they do this, it might just be a way for them to use the shots that they couldn't get Americans to take. But I don't have thorough knowledge on <em>how</em> they profit off the shots, so let me know.  </p>
<p>But what does this mean in the grand scheme of things? Well first of all, it doesn't seem like this India coverage is an accident when you assume there will definitely be a pivot to climate change sooner or later. It's also out of line with regard to what they're doing about India's crisis. Previously, when the UK and South Africa fought off COVID "variants", the US media wasn't as visceral and didn't necessarily portray these countries as up in flames, nor did so-called "developed" countries work together to help out. For this reason, I feel like the Western World is building up India as the new battlefield to fight the Coronavirus pandemic.  </p>
<p>Why would they do this? Essentially they want to "outsource" the COVID discussion to a foreign country, similar to the early days when we heard about outbreaks in China. Although there's a "COVID fatigue", there's still a market for the pandemic narrative. COVID fanatics will eat this up, not realizing that the discussion has moved elsewhere, while at the same time, the US begins to put the vaccination campaign on the backburner. It also serves to distract so-called COVID deniers. If the reporting were to all but disappear, they would take that as vindication. That's why they need a sort of placebo.    </p>
<p>This is where I will risk it all and hedge a bet that masks and social distancing will be rolled back soon. On 04/25, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/04/25/fauci-expects-new-cdc-guidance-on-outdoor-masks/">Dr. Fauci told ABC</a> that masks probably aren't necessary outdoors. And then on CBS, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-gottlieb-covid-case-decline/">Dr. Gottlieb suggested</a> that we will see a more laid-back vaccination campaign, as well as the possibility of reduced restrictions, since the at-risk populations are vaccinated.  </p>
<p>Now, if these really aren't empty promises (unlike every other time), and they actually come to fruition just in time for summer, then what do we have? That's right, an <em>economic recovery,</em> the very thing that the IEA report warned about! Whenever they're ready, the media can allude back to the report from a few weeks ago, and seriously spark some outrage about how we're <em>ignoring</em> our environmental situation! It is time to take action, <em>NOW!</em>  </p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Leaks say CNN (and probably the entire media apparatus) will pivot to climate change propaganda soon. In order to do that, they need to "undo" all the brainwashing about masks and lockdowns because the vaccine campaign is reaching its end. As they do this, Western media is portraying India as the new COVID hotspot similar to how China was viewed in early 2020. It would be perplexing for COVID stories to disappear completely, and India serves the purpose of carrying the narrative. Lately the media has been publishing stories about the climate, but they're still taking a back seat to COVID stories. Eventually however, once the restrictions are rolled back, the climate side stories will EXPLODE to the front of every news outlet and it's all you'll hear about for months.</strong></p>

        <p>This is a very interesting theory. I’ve been thinking the climate thing would be the next “thing” ever since the reports last year of all the clean air and lower emissions from people stopping everything. 
I do wonder though (and my personal bias comes through here): will there be an end to “outrage”? I for one can’t read any more “thinkpieces” or tweets from people who are mad about something. I wonder if we are nearing “outrage fatigue”? Someone is always going to be mad about something, that’s for sure. But i feel like we’ve been living the peak of it this past year. I could be totally off, for sure. I guess I just wish everyone would shut up.</p>

        <p>You're definitely right about outrage fatigue. In storytelling there's this rule that you cannot have constant tension and excitement. You need periods of calm, because otherwise people will keep expecting more novel stimuli to the point that it's impossible to keep up, or the story becomes stupid.  </p>
<p>I don't expect there to be as much outrage around climate change if/when it happens. In terms of insanity, early COVID and the BLM riots were in a league of their own. People need a break. In a year or two we'll be drama-ready again.</p>

        <p>This is a great point! I also think the idea of climate change is still too massive for many to wrap our heads around. </p>
<p>I mean... what will we possibly choose to shame people over? Taking road trips? Washing our dishes? Using the internet? It’s just too much! And everyone participates in so many things that are harmful to the environment every day without even thinking about it... I think it’ll be REALLY hard for people to fully make themselves completely foolproof and virtuous in terms of their footprint. </p>
<p>Although I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some kind of visible symbol picked to be the shaming scapegoat (à la masks), and I’m sure there are plenty of people out there very ready to find at least one thing EcoSelfish about the way I live my life.</p>

        <p>I think you are right.  Here is what I said a year ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Watch/comments/flz2wz/this_is_definitely_a_trial_run/</p>
<p>"Suspend liberties to save lives."  And we rolled over and took it, so the elites know we are both gullible and will tolerate it.  </p>
<p>It's not just the government and media that are lock step.  Now it's big business and big tech, so we are really screwed.  The amount of propaganda and censorship around COVID and the election has been staggering.  I believe they were tuning their techniques and prepping us for what comes next.</p>
<p>They will say it's about climate.  What it will really be is just more grift.  A huge money grab from the proles.</p>
