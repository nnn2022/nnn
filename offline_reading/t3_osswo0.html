    <strong>Welp. Try and base your arguments while talking to vaxxed people around this in mind</strong>
    <p><p>This is an extremely annoying paradoxical system where the vaccinated are forced to operate with a skeptical narcissism type of personality where whenever they hear something that threatens their life they forcefully have to appeal their ideas to whatever fits in their own head to survive. It leads to them becoming even more of sheeple because they can't accept death. That is why it seems like people are accepting more and more absurd information. It is because whatever they have convinced themselves to believe becomes their narrative because it is life or death if not. The narcissism part is mixed with hypocrisy as everything used against them somehow becomes a motive for how the anti-vax movement is the problem. We have the evidence on our side and the skeptical doubt that a normal person does when faced with a logical problem. The vaxxed people have it where they actually can't think for themselves because of the fight or flight mechanic in the human brain. If someone has got the vaccine, how can you expect them to be logical? They have to fit their narrative or else it means death. It is the hard truth</p></p>

        <p>Well said. They are exhibiting cult-like behavior at every turn. At work recently, in a state where we have our mask mandate lifted for the ladt month, had a double masked vaxxed girl asking me if I had the shot since I don't wear a mask and "you still have to wear a mask if you aren't vaccinated." I should have said something like I assume you didn't get the shot (I know she did because she told me months ago)  since you are rocking a double mask, right? It is a fear and death cult, plain and simple. They have become initiates. The people who never questioned the masks, never questioned the news stories showing the flooded ER's. This is their new superimposed reality. They believe as devout as a muslim willing to blow themselves up for the faith. They will turn us over and gladly see us rounded up and put in camps. They are like podpeople or worse. Resist them at the risk of destroying your own soul. This is a war on reality. It is a satanic deception. Pure evil in its nature. Worse than any other evil because it is being purported it is for the common good. They don't realize they are creating a sci-fi dystopia and dragging all of humanity along.</p>
