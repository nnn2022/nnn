    <strong>The stages of grief</strong>
    <p><p>People need to go through the “stages of grief” and come to acceptance that there is no containing this virus. </p>
<p><strong>Denial</strong></p>
<p>First there was the shock event in March and April. Things shut down and two weeks, two weeks, two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Anger</strong></p>
<p>Then there was the anger of blm protests in summer, attacks on the maskless, angry spitting neckvein news commentators and politicians. Just this unhinged and hysterical anger.</p>
<p><strong>Bargaining</strong></p>
<p>Now it seems the masses want to believe there is a solution for every problem and you’re not trying hard enough if you can’t come up with one, so now we’re in the “bargaining” stage of grief. There’s a psychological thing that if we can just sacrifice enough and do our penance, then things will be made right. Thus the lockdowns and mandates are now getting WORSE.</p>
<p><strong>Depression</strong></p>
<p>This is next. People are going to sacrifice so much they’ll never get back and then the realization will hit them that it didn’t make a difference, they’ll go through a mini-loop of the first three stages of grief (because this realization is it’s own new shock event). And then they hit a hard, teary, stagnant, oscillating-between-apathy-and-emotionality depression. It will be reflected in an economic depression, social depression, everything run down and dreary. It’s going to be awful.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong></p>
<p>This is why keeping up our morale and humanity is so important. We can see beyond the cycle because we’re not wrapped-up in the MSM narrative. Our soul, heart, traditions, warmth, humanity, kindness, and all that good stuff are going to be a rock in a turbulent sea of depression for the rest of the world as it struggles to come to the acceptance that we’ve already achieved.</p>
<p>“The powers that be” may have an agenda, but we have heart, and humanity will always win back humanity.</p></p>

        <p>Several months ago I realized I had gone through the 5 stages of grief. It was ai strange to realize. I seem to bounce between depression and acceptance though. Depends on what’s happened that day and where my thoughts are. Some days I just want to crawl in bed and never get up other days I say, “This is life now. Ok. I can control me. I will smile and be friendly and do good today.” </p>
<p>I just still can’t believe this seemed to happen in one day. I remember when the lockdown was announced. One day our whole world was changed. Obviously things have led up to this. But one day life was normal and the next it wasn’t. Sad really.</p>

        <p>I also had the realization that I was grieving and found it startling... I bounce between anger (mostly for my children) and acceptance (but for me it's accepting that life isn't going to go back to normal so I'm gonna have to raise my kids as resistors and I hate that for them, it isn't fucking fair they'll be ridiculed, mocked, and attacked for <em>living</em>)</p>

        <p>That’s exactly it everyone thinks life will “go back to normal if everyone would just...” and what they don’t realize is that even if we weld everyone in their homes for 10 years, there’s no going back to normal. The only way to go back to normal is for the general consensus to collectively shift in that direction, but maybe even that is an “if everyone would just...” too.</p>

        <p>I don't understand why people don't get this. As if it's possible to control others. It's just not. And even if it were, in the end, the virus would come back. This is madness. These people are actually mentally ill.</p>

        <p>I still get angry sometimes too. More because friends who say they think it’s all stupid and seem to agree with my thinking still follow the rules. Now I wear a mask if asked and stuff but I am not going to follow rules nobody knows about. Like quarantining because we visit a “banned” state. Or getting tested and missing 2 weeks of work simply because a friend I visited calls me to say they have covid now. If I don’t have symptoms I am not getting tested or missing work. Nobody is standing at your door making sure you follow those rules. STOP DOING IT! Just live like like you would have a year ago. And nobody is tracking where I travel for holidays and vacation...not yet.</p>

        <p>There will be also anger at the depression stage. Real anger. </p>
<p>But the bargaining stage is going to suck for a while</p>
