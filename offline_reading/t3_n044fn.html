    <strong>Just need to vent...</strong>
    <p><p>Last week, my grandpa was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer out of nowhere (life expectancy is less than a year).  I’ve seen him once this year due to COVID paranoia from my extended family (understandable at the time as they are 80+), however, in hindsight it just pissed me off even more.</p>
<p>We sacrificed such an important year for him due to this virus with a 99.8% survival rate, just for him to get a disease with a 1% survival rate, the same week he got the first COVID shot.  </p>
<p>Fuck COVID. Fuck the delusional left that confuse to do more harm than good, fuck Fauci, and fuck these pathetic CDC “scientists”.</p>
<p>This fucking “pandemic” has made us forget what the deadly illnesses actually are, and filled our heads with bullshit propaganda.</p></p>

        <p>The more I read these kinds of harrowing accounts, the happier I am for making the snap decision back in February 2020 to assume that everything being told to me about Cough19 is wrong.</p>
<p>I did not suspect conspiracy (I don't suspect conspiracy now either) - I just assumed stupidity, hubris and need for ratings (in the case of the media). Glad I made the judgment call not to listen to the BS. I caught cough19 in early March 2020, got over it real quick (the easiest cough I ever caught, really) and have been <em>unable</em> to catch it again even though I never observed any of the "measures" allegedly meant to protect me.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry to hear that you went through this, OP. Now go visit your grandpa! Make his (likely) last year on the planet much better for him.</p>
<p>And yeah, fuck the delusional Left too.</p>
