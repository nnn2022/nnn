    <strong>How come in May and September when I went to my hospital's radiology department there were no more than 2 people in there?</strong>
    <p><p>I went for an MRI scan both times. The scans were at least 30 minutes long each time, so there was going in and coming out. The department was like a ghost town. Don't people go to the radiology department to confirm if they have pneumonia?</p></p>

        <p>Maybe they are limiting the new people in their at one time? Maybe where you go for a MRI is different from where they send patients for X-rays for pneumonia?</p>
