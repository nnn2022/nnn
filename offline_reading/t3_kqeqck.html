    <strong>I'm interested to see what you guys think.</strong>
    <p><p>I was born right around 9/11 and lots of people older than me say how they remember how life was different before it happened and how in some ways, the disaster changed life forever. </p>
<p>Do you guys think that even if we all stand up and fight against this tyranny and by some miracle, win, that life as we knew it is still gone? I absolutely can't stand to think that way, but I'm afraid it's a possibility. What do you guys think? Is there hope at all that we will ever get the old normal back? I know that we need to stand up and fight this tyranny, and that that's the only way to defeat it, but even if we do that, do you think we will truly get the old, true normal back that we all remember? Do you think face diapers will still be commonplace in some areas or during flu season? Do you think stores will always have those stupid little antisocial distancing stickers on the ground even when this is over? Do you think kids will go to school with plexiglass separating their desks? Do you think we will need a vaccine card to go anywhere, not just different countries, but stores and things? Do you think it is at all possible to get every aspect of normal life back? Or do you think life as we know it in some ways is altered forever and never coming back?</p>
<p>This terrifies me deeply. I want nothing to do with this "new abnormal" and I want every little aspect of my old life back and I am willing to fight and I know others are too, but will it be enough? Will life ever be completely normal again? </p>
<p>I'd like to know your honest thoughts. If you see any hope that I can't see, feel free to share it, but also don't feel like you need to sugarcoat anything. I just want to know what people think. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p></p>

        <p>IF we manage to fight and win this, imo we'll get back our normal life as we knew it before. It might take some time for the sheeps to realize this whole scamdemic was a complete hoax but eventually we'll return back.</p>

        <p>Whoo, just 18. You have at least 12 years to waste until you're 30, so no worries there. At 18 I was doing drugs with my "friends", not sitting in the Internet. Relax and have fun.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm not doing drugs or smoking or drinking or sleeping around or anything like that. I don't even go on the computer much anyway. Just to check email and look here because it's the only place on the Internet that doesn't drive me insane. I'd relax if I could, but I'm just so stressed every day by the state of the world. I listen to music and go for walks, and that helps a bit but there's only so much I can do. It just feels like my youth is being wasted since who knows how long this will last.</p>

        <p>take it from someone who was 17 on 9/11 - do some drugs (safely, in moderation, don't do anything nuts), drink until you puke once in awhile, have sex, fall in love, have your heart broken, travel the world, watch the sunset and watch the sunrise, dance under the stars, laugh until you cry, make new friends and cherish the old, laugh at bad jokes, call your mother, go for a long drive with the windows down and the music up.</p>
<p>get lost, find yourself, discover that your energy never really goes away, it just takes a different form.</p>
<p>never pass up the opportunity to tell someone that you love them, or you need them, or that you will miss them fiercely. you never know when your last chance to tell that person how much they really mean to you.</p>
<p>i remember life before 9/11 - it was less complicated, if that makes sense. technology was still a useful tool, not a necessary application. life was a lot quieter in many ways before the days of cell phones and wifi. but in other ways it was so much louder - and busier, and you were closer to the people around you in your world. literally - you had to write down people's phone numbers and birthdays, when they called your house they had to talk to your parents. it was delightful and delicious and analog and private. you could keep secrets. you could steal a beer from your dad and no one cared.</p>
<p>my childhood ended on 9/11. my dad still has the voicemail i left him around 0930 ET that morning, telling him i loved him and i hoped he was okay. he was okay. time only goes one way, and it kept going. we woke up on 12 Sep 2001 and we had the rare day off from school, and everything was different, but everything was the same. everyone knew someone who had been lost, someone who was waiting for good or bad news. everyone wanted to go back into work and get back on planes and kick some ass. i had sex with a guy in his car to try and forget for a little while that everything wasn't okay. and yet it was okay anyway. i drank wine with my mother. it turned out alright, eventually.</p>
<p>now i'm just a thirty-something trapped between GenX and the Millennials, and my husband and i wonder how we'll raise our children in this strange new digital world. the analog world was comfortable and easy, and it's never felt further away. </p>
<p>the lockdowns never would have been possible in 2001. so in many ways, i wish i could go back to those days, knowing what i know now. i don't think i fit into this world as we know it now. i reject most technology, i collect books, and i have to keep deleting the banking app from my husband's phone because i can't trust these people. </p>
<p>more people have to want to return to the days of analog. we gave up so many civil liberties and principals after 9/11 in the name of safety. we're still at war in the Middle and Near East. we've always been at war with Eastasia.</p>
<p>Freedom, you're young - you're never ever going to be this young again. get out there, make some questionable choices, you'll regret not making them when you're older if you don't live a little now. breathe fresh air into your lungs under the great sky and open your eyes every morning. best of luck, and may god bless and keep you.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for your response.</p>
<p>I'm not going to get into drugs or alcohol because if I'm truly happy, I want it to be real, but there are tons of little things that make me happy and when people stop being paranoid sheep (whenever that happens) I'll be able to do things that make me really happy, maybe my life will get better. I want to travel a lot and I know lots of people say they want to travel, but I really do. I want to spend some time in every state, and I have a list of countries I want to go to and maybe even live in for a while. My Swedish teacher is from Wisconsin and he's only 25 but he's actually lived in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany for a few years. He's so young and he's already done so much with his life and I want to do the same.</p>
<p>I am just like you with rejecting technology. I don't even have a cell phone. My parents made me get one when I was in high school, but now I'm in college and I got rid of it since my school is using it to track us, and no, I'm not joking, because I would get threats through text messages from them every time I would leave my house. (It's all online.) So I just did away with it and I use the landline and I never want a cell phone again. I've got a computer, that's all the modern stuff I need. The phone by my bed may be 46 years old and rotary dial, but it works great, after all these years.</p>
<p>My dad was a kid in the 50s and a teenager in the 60s and he is in his 70s now and never modernized (not that I blame him.) So I kind of grew up in a with a  50s/60s life since I was also homeschooled and had basically no friends and that's what's normal to me and I feel like in some ways, I belong in that time too. I'm not modern at all and I'm okay with that. Using a computer is the only "modern" thing I could say I do. I don't ever want to rely on technology too much and I'm glad you don't either.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your thought-out response. God bless you as well.</p>

        <p>Good on you. Healthy way of life is also good. You can do exercises as well. Go check Ari Yoga challenge and have a laugh, he's awesome: https://youtu.be/AYyYjq60bLo</p>
<p>There's only so much anyone can do, try not to overthink things. Easier said than done but doable nonetheless, lol.</p>

        <p>Its us against the World, and half of "us" have already surrendered.  Things don't look good. Consider this, even fighting will create a "new normal". Protests instead of ballgames. Weapons training instead of soccer practice. No, my friend,  this is not EVER going to be the same.</p>

<p>There aren't enough of us, and we're easily fracturable.  They have been planning this for decades, and have all the money/influence on their side.</p>
<p>The best thing I believe for us at this time is to "Go John Galt".  He's a character in Atlas Shrugged who instead of continuing to subject himself to the tyranny he just simply disappeared.</p>
<p>If we fight, they will strike us down.  But their society won't run if we all lay down.</p>
