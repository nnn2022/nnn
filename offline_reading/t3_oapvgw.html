    <strong>Your "empathy" isn't real</strong>
    <p><p>I have yet to see anyone raise this point: For everyone claiming that they're following the safety guidelines, wearing masks, and getting vaxxed for the sake of people vulnerable to Covid, where's the same concern for people dying and suffering crippling side effects from the vaccine? </p>
<p>For people saying "Well, the chances that you'll actually die or suffer side effects from the vaccine are slim"</p>
<p>The same logic can be applied to Covid, it's not life-threatening unless you're elderly or have underlying health conditions, but people are also dying from the vaccines, it's been documented. 
The minorities of people you're claiming to be so concerned about are also dying because of the vaccines, and your response is...what? Looking the other way?</p>
<p>When someone dies from Covid, it's supposed to be some sort of profound loss, but when someone dies or suffers from the vaccine, it's just a shoulder shrug and an "Oh well"? "Necessary sacrifice"????</p>
<p>Why are you so willing to throw people under the bus to be guinea pigs for a jab that has <em>numerous</em> potential side effects? If you supposedly care so much about the lives and health of others, why are you not getting angry about the people who have suffered or died as a result of the vaccines that are undertested and rushed and <em>demanding</em> that they be recalled? Shouldn't their lives matter just as much as those you want to protect from the virus?</p>
<p>Admit it, you just want to be able to have some sort of moral high-ground to cling to no matter how shallow so that you can show off how great of a person you are to others, and it really disgusts me. Your "empathy" isn't real, you don't want to listen to differing viewpoints because you can't admit that you're in the wrong and being a virtue-signaling bootlicker is just easier for you.</p></p>

        <p>They don’t believe anyone is dying from the vaccine. To them, any deaths following the vaccine are merely coincidental.</p>
<p>Yes, the irony is palpable. No, they won’t come around when you point it out.</p>

        <p>Quit job after summer 2020. Started working. In long term care facility. Treated covid positive patients, hugged them, talked with them in their rooms without demanding they wear a mask ( their o2 satuations were low after all, what kind of sick fuck makes an o2 diminished patient wear a mask) I never got covid despite spending hours upon hours with covid positive patients. If I can hug your grandma when shes sick you sure as fuck can when shes healthy</p>

        <p>Last I saw, for every 3 deaths they prevent, 2 people die from the vaccines.</p>
<p>The difference is the average age of death from the virus is at or above the average age of death, whereas the average age of death from the vaccines is much lower.</p>
<p>Also many injuries, such as blindness, paralysis and so on, which I didn't hear much of about the actual virus?</p>

        <p>I still suffer irregular heartbeat from refrigerant poisoning.</p>
<p>I know they say that it is heart inflammation that is cause the heart problems, but the symptoms are so similar to hydrocarbon (or substituted hydrocarbons in the case of freon) poisoning that I am not convinced there isnt some kind of molecule like chloroform in it.</p>
<p>I wouldnt have wanted to take the shot to begin with. I do not take aspirin, or any over the counter pills like that or vitamins. I have done very well at avoiding pharma products because I thought they made me weaker by using them.</p>
<p>But knowing that this shot is causing irregular heart beat, I feel I would be out of my mind to knowingly get this shot.</p>
<p>I can't get a doctor to recognize I have irregular heart beat, let alone from refrigerant poisoning. (It's mostly gone away after a few years, hoping it will be gone in another few.) I am not even going to attempt to waste a hundred hours of my life at walk in clinics trying to find someone with half a brain and a heart to listen to write me a medical exemption.</p>

        <p>Been feeling this way for the last 15 months regarding masks and “social distancing”. They make life way harder for people (myself included in a couple of these ways) who rely on lip-reading, are claustrophobic, have social anxiety, depression etc. and yet bringing this up to supposedly highly-empathic people gets shrugged off. It’s stupidly dogmatic - I’m not particularly empathic or caring but I can understand and acknowledge why some people might be interested in lockdowns/masks/vaccines without letting it affect my overall opinions</p>
