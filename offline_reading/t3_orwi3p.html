    <strong>Call to reflect</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys! I've been following this subreddit for the last 8 months, and I've noticed a change in its contents that I want to highlight and invite you all to reflect upon it.</p>
<p>I have seen a transition in content from being mostly informative (mainly to boost confidence and conviction in people who thinks there's something that doesn't add up with all thats going on) to being mostly hateful, ironic and bulling to people who think or see the situation differently. </p>
<p>I noticed this gradual change but I didn't give it much importance until I found myself having negative and hateful thoughts, specially when discussing or confronting with people that thinks in a different way. I then realised that I spend at least a few hours a day reading about what's going on (including reading content on this subreddit) and that a lot of that content is unhealthy and provokes more division and hate in people.</p>
<p>I'm 100% convinced that I'm part of the change that we need to make to get out of this. I'm not getting the jab because I don't agree with the ways this treatment is being developed and I don't think it's made to solve the problem. Most of the time I don't wear a face mask for the same reasons. I try to share a much good and real information as possible, because I think more people need to see what's happening in the world. I'm against the lose of freedom of speach, the curfews, the mandatory social distancing, all mandatory medical treatments, the unreasonable panic, the massive poverty, and humongous psyche-damage coming from this situation. </p>
<p>I consider myself a lucky guy (I believe in destiny but that's not the topic of this post), who seen a bit of the world to understand things that most people can't. But each and everyone of us have their own processes to go through and get to what is important for them in life. I don't consider myself superior than anybody else, and I don't think other people is guilty or stupid for not being able to see what I do. All these people respond like programmed machines to the system and need to be treated with empathy, patience and care. It's not their fault, but the system's!</p>
<p>All pro-covid individuals, or those who surrendered to the fear imposed by the media and propaganda, repeat what have been consuming in TV, and respond to the current demonstrations and oppositions with hate, irony and bulling. If I say that I understood something about what's going on, I just can't play that game, or I would be behaving exactly the same as them. I want a change on what's happening, this situation have affected all of us and it can get worse if we don't react soon! I just don't think more division will bring an answer.</p>
<p>Maybe its time that we stop emphasizing our differences and act constructively to end this situation. In protests around the world a lot of people vaccinated have been in the streets claiming for freedom. We need to be together, today more than ever!</p>
<p>If we understood something, lets make a difference!</p></p>

        <p>We are in a psychological war and our enemies are taking away every space we have to speak, and it seems to me that you think a proper response to that assault is to be excellent to each other? </p>
<p>Is that the gist of it?</p>
<p>My opinion is you win narrative battles by volume, repetition and otherwise drowning out voices which invade.</p>
<p>Every single sub I am aware of which is a counter to the mainstream narrative (regardless of which specific agenda we are talking about) takes a “high road” approach.</p>
<p>You want to know what they all have in common?</p>
<p>They are unsuccessful in shaping the culture.</p>

&rt;This guy: hey NNN, I'm totally one of you, but don't you think you're "being mostly hateful, ironic and bulling to people who think or see the situation differently."</p>
<p>Yeah, you'll have to excuse us for not believing your BS and defending ourselves from people who are literally calling for our death.</p>

        <p>There's a time and place for everything, but the time for peace passed for me the moment they told us to eat fucking bugs.</p>
<p>Even peaceful protesting doesn't do shit because the media will always spin it to where we're the bad guys. Look at france, where even police brutality is praised because they're putting those plague rats back in their place.</p>
