<p>I expect COVIDeers will dismiss this, claiming we’re even busier this year due to the virus du jour, but this year’s statistics prove bed capacity was down by almost 7% from last year (88% from 94.9%).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9005713/Covid-data-transparency-row-deepens-Michael-Gove-warns-hospitals-88-full.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9005713/Covid-data-transparency-row-deepens-Michael-Gove-warns-hospitals-88-full.html</a></p>
<p>“He told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/bbc/index.html"><strong>BBC</strong></a>: 'Data shows the average bed capacity in the NHS, in England, in the week ending November 15 was 88 per cent – that's almost nine in 10 beds being occupied.' </p>
<p>While the 88 per cent statistic might seem shocking, it is actually in line with how busy the health service normally is on any given winter. For example, MailOnline's analysis of official data yesterday found occupancy stood at 94.9 per cent, on average, in the week ending December 8 in 2019, which is the earliest snapshot published by NHS England last winter.”</p>

        <p>Not just the last decade... At least the last TWO decades have the hospitals been at or near 100% capacity in the winter at multiple points.</p>
<p>The difference with this pandemic is that so many people with CoVid-19 need to be put on ventilators or were thought before August to need to be put on ventilators.</p>
<p>We now know that it is a hellishly bad idea to put people with CoVid-19 on ventilators because 80% of them don't survive when we do that compared to 80 who DO survive with just high-flow nasal cannula.</p>
<p>I don't understand why they were so damned gung-ho in the beginning to put people on ventilators knowing that should be the last of the last of the last of the last of the last resorts because of that tendency for people to die while on them.</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons why I contacted a medical malpractice attorney when my father died due to CoVid-19 in May along with the obvious medical malpractice that was going on at the rehab center he was in where he caught CoVid-19 and brought it home to me and Mom, killing Mom as well.</p>
<p>I blame the rehab center for that because according to their own nurses and father's statement to me and Mom, they had known for 2 weeks before shipping him home that they had actual symptomatic cases of CoVid-19 at that facility.</p>
