    <strong>Anecdotal: Probable Changes to Canadian Quarantine Rules for the "Fully Vaxxed", but with Two Different Types of Vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>For context, I was at a barbecue yesterday with an EMT friend of mine who works for Alberta Health Services at an airport. He told me that his manager told him and his colleagues that new quarantine rules for Canadians that have received two doses of vaccine, yet of two different types (e.g., AZ first and Pfizer second), would soon be implemented. He stated that those who have received two doses of different types of vaccines will soon be subject the same quarantine requirements for international travel as those who are not fully vaccinated or not vaccinated at all. </p>
<p>Naturally, this policy change will be imposed by the corrupt and contemptuous Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) (e.g., the head of the agency was recently rebuked by Parliament) without provincial input or approval. The fucked up part is that PHAC is currently championing vaccine type mixing as official public health guidance, which is convenient given their supply chain incompetence and the current political winds. </p>
<p>Those Canadians that have received one dose can do with this information what you will. Those, like myself, who have not, and are not planning to get any of the current iteration of vaccines,  can sit back and laugh as one of the carrots our farce of a government dangled in front of us is yanked away. </p>
<p>P.S. </p>
<p>Although my friend works for a corrupt  medical system, he knows my views on this whole pandemic debacle and is quite skeptical of the health system and government as a default and recognizes he is trapped within such a system for his own economic survival and is trying to find alternatives.</p></p>

        <p>For now. My friend said changes are coming down the pipeline so that only those with two of the same type may have more favourable quarantine conditions. These changes have not yet been announced or implemented, but they likely will be within the year. Yet these are saying that combining types is fine now.</p>

        <p>Similar, but this will likely be imposed by a government on its own citizens returning to their  own country who took the “scientific” advice from the very same government at the time they got vaccinated.</p>
