    <strong>The CovidVaccinated Subreddit Is Terrifying</strong>
    <p><p>Not only is it fucking rife with censorship and Branch Covidians desperately trying to convince themselves they've made the right choice, every other post that manages to slip past the mods and their "Fact  Checkers" reads like a fucking Resident Evil diary entry: "had second  shot of Moderna vaccine today... feel weird... arm itchy... tasty."</p>
<p>People are deathly afraid of a virus with a 99.7% survival rate but they'll gladly stick their arm out for a rushed, experimental "vaccine" whose  only purpose is to ostensibly protect them from said virus and whose long-term effects aren't known? Absolute brainwashed clowns. These people come to subreddits like this one with the sole purpose of scoffing at and "debunking conspiracy theories" that later turn out to be true; maybe if they extended the same level of skepticism and questioning towards the MSM as they do towards us they'd think twice before becoming human guinea pigs for free doughnuts and internet brownie points.</p>
<p>The carrots they're feeding you are just orange-coated sticks you fucking muppets. WAKE THE FUCK UP AND TASTE THE SPLINTERS ALREADY.</p></p>

        <p>The majority of mankind cannot be saved. There is no great awakening. Truth lovers will always be in the minority. The circle jerk groupthink trumps the tiny residue of logic and reason and critical thinking skills that is still present in most minds after a century of media brainwash. Fragile egos prevent any admission of own failure, instead, they will blame the others.  It's a mass delusion. Playing those mi-ind games, forever...</p>
<p>Save yourself, and your closest loved ones, which is already difficult enough. All else is bonus. God bless.</p>

        <p>This is the sad truth. I have given up trying to convince most people or even ask logical questions. </p>
<p>The root problem is spiritual, and no matter how strong or obvious the logic, most people are not spiritually right with God so they will always revert to the brainwashing.</p>

        <p>You don’t even have to believe in god to see that there is a massive spiritual problem. I’m a skeptic of religion, but 100% believer in the spiritual world and see how utterly broken humans are. We have been mostly completely separated from our souls and it shows.</p>

        <p>I think religion is kinda like propaganda to some extent, theres some truth to them which makes them valid to a lot but theres also a lot of false information which makes them invalid to a lot. I think this tends to make people overlook spirituality in itself as an alternative to being either religious or Atheist.</p>

        <p>Trying to get back to it. 2020 derailed me HARD. Along with everyone else. All the shit that weighed me down before is bubbling to the surface again. I take it as a sign that it’s time again to sift through the pain of the past and move through it again, adding 2020 to the pile. Working towards releasing myself from the extra shit</p>

        <p>I like to think it's a bit of a test. Also the biggest problems we could ever have on earth are like when toddlers are fighting in the eyes of a creator. I think there's some type of universal balance that is guided but not controlled by this being. Both asleep and awake at the same time. We happen to be a vessel on the awake spectrum to some extent.</p>

        <p>I didn't say you cannot see some of the traps without God, but you will have a hard time seeing them all. In the end in spite of all your knowledge, you may find yourself struggling against the system that's coming. </p>
<p>The fact that you're here means you have some logic and conscience bro, so I would recommend you to check out the gospel of Matthew in the Bible and evaluate it's spiritual truth and moral lessons for yourself, as that is the part of the Bible that is "straight from the horses mouth", so to speak and the best place to start. Don't worry about the Old Testament too much for now.</p>
<p>Then check out Revelations 13 for the Mark of the Beast that's coming. </p>
<p>Yes God is often misrepresented by humans, but that is because they are humans.</p>

        <p>Where did anyone say atheist?   </p>
<p>So believing in god, doesn’t count as believing in nonsense?    Hint it does since it cannot be proven.  The evidence for aliens is the same as the evidence for god....few and far between.   Both are subject to speculation and personal experiences.   And again both can exist, both can be the same and we both can be totally wrong.   But i don’t discount those that believe in either god or aliens as believing in nonsense.</p>

        <p>The bible is the single most proven book on earth. Even the prophecies are coming out these very days. Only science falsely so called is the last barrier that they use to lure the sheep into cosmological bullshit. The same bought science that brings us covid, brings us evolution and other unprovable nonsense. All to hide the truth. There is only one truth. Lies and truth cannot co exist in the same theory.</p>

        <p>My last thought on this topic.   My grandson caught a fish the other day and excitedly called me to tell me about it.   He said it was a 20 inch trout.     Video proved it was not 20 or a trout.   However those are the only words he knows and understands.  This is how i view parts of the bible.   It was written in only terms they currently understood.   </p>
<p>I’m sure you will disagree.  However back on topic...FUCK covid demons that are exposing themselves (gates/fauci)</p>

        <p>Suit yourself. I see the proof all around me every day, and in all the proven lies with which they try to franticslly hide this truth. Covid is part of this deception. It is perfectly explainable with the scriptures. But I am glad to have you on the good side here. Any defense of truth is a defense of God in my world. Never wondered why the evil elite are satanists? Does that not make you think?</p>

        <p>&rt;The root problem is spiritual, and no matter how strong or obvious the logic, most people are not spiritually right with God so they will always revert to the brainwashing.</p>
<p>Man, this great deception is soooooooooo demonic and is unparalleled in human history. What is more alarming is that those who allegedly in the Body of Christ have been deceived and continue to choose to be deceived. I mean churches becoming mass vaxx centres is a phenomenon that I still cannot process. When the deceived are told about mUh aLiEnZ, they will believe it too.</p>

        <p>Good find on the video! I do remember seeing the graffiti in game. I took a screen shot and sent it to all my friends who play. Were still in the storyline unsleuthing who our agents (characters )in game actually wrk for . The game so has echoes ( time travel view technology), and recordings that you unravel like a mystery</p>
<p>They have a Division 2.5 title coming out called Heartland. It will be frree to play.  NGN on youtube details the plotline behind the game. The Division  movie is coming out on netflix. </p>
<p>Thanks for the mini series recommendation! Been looking to find a good mini series. Last one i saw was 11 22 63</p>

        <p>The propaganda is working very well, it’s pretty much inescapable unless you’re able to somehow break free from it and wake up.   They are just exacerbating the tyranny with their blind compliance and pretty soon it’ll be to late. It’s scary to think how fast this has all happened. Imagine what it’ll be like in a year from now.

It's like he turns on NPR or CNN and his brain gets a Big-Reset. It's super frustrating and I feel myself distancing from him because I can't take it much longer. We can't even seem to agree to disagree and move on because it keeps getting brought up.</p>

        <p>This is more on the politicians and media. If you look at the actual effectiveness from the studies and real life data, the vaccines are extremely effective and should cause an immediate end to all restrictions in any country where it has even available to every adult. (Not that I supported the restrictions to begin with but the fear of vaccine breakthrough cases is bogus fear porn to keep lockdowns and masks.)</p>

        <p>By all available data, getting vaccinated reduces the chances of being hospitalized by approximately %95. That's about the same as favorable outcomes in vehicular accidents wearing a seatbelt vs not wearing one. So by your own metric of a safety device in a car getting the vaccine makes sense.</p>

        <p>Reddit has been like that for several years. In the majority of subs if you utter a counter-PC opinion you will just get brigaded or banned. Even in the PC subs they are all terrified of stepping out of line and have to add caveats to everything they post like "I'm not a racist but", "I'm not a Trump supporter but"...</p>

        <p>I know, the Pfizer vaccine subreddit was rife with really bizarre side effects like: I feel really angry, menstruation problems, I got both Pfizer and Moderna, is that ok… etc etc etc 
Until it totally stopped 90 some days ago. Nothing anymore. 
Went to covidvaccinated, asked about it (politely!) and bam - permanently banned from the subreddit.</p>
