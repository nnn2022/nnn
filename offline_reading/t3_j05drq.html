    <strong>Is there any hope for the sheep?</strong>
    <p><p>If someone is born a sheep, is there any hope for them, or are they genetically incapable of ever being red-pilled?</p>
<p>I suspect it's the latter. I don't think any of us red-pilled people was ever truly a sheep, even going back years when we didn't know anything about conspiracies or the secret elite. We were always nonconformists in our own ways. We were born this way. It was always a matter of time before we woke up.</p>
<p>The sheep are simply incapable of waking up.</p>

        <p>This. I'd say anybody who listens to doctor fauci and mainstream media will never wake up. Luckily they dont even get over a million viewers on any network except fox. Its about 4-6 percent of the voting population in my calculations. The vast majority who arent totally hypnotized will wake up. Many people are about to be arrested over the coming months in my opinion. This lockdown was criminal on many levels</p>

        <p>You're saying the exact opposite of me, though. I'm saying some who listen to Fauci and the media will wake up, but most will not. I also don't believe it's 4-6 percent of the population, it's much more than that. If only a couple people were drinking the Kool-aid, we'd see much more resistance and rebellion against the "New Normal" than we do right now.</p>

        <p>He may be right. I think there are many more "go along to get along" people than we know. Another silent majority. Just like the far left, there are a few that make the most noise and have the platform and the media in turn makes you think it's everybody by amplifying the noise. It's kind of akin to Trump's win in 2016. The left started believing their own narrative and we're stunned when they realized it wasn't what they convinced themselves it was. I think the whole #maskup thing is similar.</p>

        <p>Ok. Not the best analogy, but no one gave him a chance right up until he won. Many more people voted for him than anyone thought would. The point being. I think there are more people than we might think that are ready to stop this charade.</p>

        <p>Here in Michigan we just got enough signatures to repeal our Governor's emergency powers. 60 days for legislature to pass and it's expected to pass. If it doesn't then we vote on it in 2022. It's very important that no other Governor ever have the sort of power she had again .Then we have a recall effort starting next week. Hopefully we set an example for every other state</p>
<p>On top of that the Department of Justice is investigating her for how she handled the nursing homes and all the deaths she caused. Cuomo too. They I think if they delay it until after the election Joe Biden will be in power and able to Pardon them but they are sorely mistaken</p>

He is a paid shill being used to fear monger and scare the population into believing him and that the china virus is much worse than it actually is because he is a so called "doctor".
He is full of shit and is being used to brainwash the population using scare tactics and just the fact alone that he is a regular on CNN is a major blow to his credibility. He is as much a doctor as Bill Gates is a scientist!</p>

The over inflated death numbers, the "you have to wear a mask and social distance" bullshit...If you are to stunned to get that, can't look up for yourself what is really going on and where this all leads, then you listen to the fake Dr, do as you are told and be a good little sheep, wear your mask, keep your distance, get your vaccine, see where that gets you, but i'll tell you right now, its not good.</p>

        <p>&rt;Great White Hope,</p>
<p>I don't know who that is but i assume this is some sarcastic reference.</p>
<p>&rt;I honestly don't fucking care what the fake "Dr" has to say because what comes out of his mouth are lies.</p>
<p>So, in other words, you don't actually KNOW if he has said anything wrong, you just decided that is what he does for.. no reason?</p>
<p>&rt;The over inflated death numbers,</p>
<p>Are under reported and you have about 70k of excess deaths unexplained. On top of the +200k already. There is no discrepancies there and it also follows predictions and is coherent with the rest of the world. To put it bluntly: for these numbers to be wrong, the ENTIER WORLD would have to be wrong. And what are the probabilities of that happening, nations that are close at war with each other suddenly agreeing about something like this..</p>
<p>&rt;the "you have to wear a mask and social distance" bullshit..</p>
<p>Seems to work in EVERY SINGLE OTHER COUNTRY, including mine. Top 10 in the least affected economies, top 10 in the least number of death. Simply because we listened what our health officials said, and it is exactly what Dr Fauci has said. Well, not exactly since we also used aggressive contact tracing and quarantining, which started IMMEDIATELY and not freaking months after. Government has 80% support for their handling of the pandemic. Yours?</p>
<p>In other words, you had nothing. I said already "next guy please" as you obviously have no idea about.. any of this. You said that all he says is lies and that was not based on ANY fact whatsoever. I really am disappointed.  </p>
<p>Remember the topic: is there anything that you can say to convince a "sheep". So you can't just say "i know it, so trust me".. How can i trust you if half the world is in cahoots? You have to have something else than that. You can't then say that the "sheeps" will not listen to anything if you can't deliver actually anything.. unless it is that i just believe you, with no evidence whatsoever. If you are uncapable, please ask someone to replace you that does know and can actually give me the answers. You can't objectively say that you have actually tried to convince me yet.   </p>
<p>Who would trust anyone with so little proof and the topic being this huge? Would YOU  trust YOU if you were the one asking these questions?</p>

        <p>I dunno, some things are black and white.  I don't think it is ever OK for a government to force people into their homes under threat of violence from the state.  So on that, its pretty black and white for me.  Not everything needs to be shades of grey.</p>

        <p>No I don't think there's any hope and I think you're right that it his something to do with genetics. It's very simple: most people deal with negativity by denying it and distracting themselves from it. The others (fewer in number), find it more painful to act like nothing is wrong and so accept the reality. I've always been like that, even as a child. I would notice things and predict bad events before anyone else in my family, and they would call me crazy, negative, say I'm exaggerating. But many times I was right.</p>

        <p>This is a very timely question and such an important one.  Each of us has our set of impressions gathered from interacting with other people:  that people slavishly follow authority or group thinking and make decisions based on feelings.  I have also collected social psychology observations over the years:  during wars it is said that the 10% of people who can think independently are sought out and eliminated;   a video on Youtube that said that the brains of most people react to new ideas as if war was declared (ie. the brains are in a state of extreme stress and displeasure);  and the emerging documents from antiquity that seem to indicate that we are a slave planet.</p>
<p>I think the sheep are incapable of waking up in a timely way but could awaken over many decades or lifetimes.  The sheep need protection.  However, the sheep are programmed to harm and even attack red pilled people, especially if you try to educate them.  My experience and that of other thinkers is that I have PTSD from all the unfair and sociopathic attacks.  Red pilled people need to gather and support each other.  I use the term "gather" loosely.</p>

        <p>I think it depends on the person. My Dad and Grandpa think like we do, so luckily this was passed to Dad, my Aunt, me, and my brother. My Grandma "woke up" because of her Husband. My Stepmom was raised as the conformist type and still has some in her, but she now notices when things are off because of being around Dad and the rest of us. </p>
<p>I'm a woman, and I had four best friends in high school, all female. Still have three. Two of them know the government sucks and the world is a mess, but they don't like to talk about it. The other two are sheep, but it's not their fault. Both were sheltered. One's family is really religious to the point where it seems abnormal. The religious one thinks that anyone who believes the government is corrupt is just someone with too much free time who might also be mentally ill. She is kind and tolerant, so she remained my friend despite our differences. Nothing I ever said about that stuff sunk in with her or her Mom though. Both just thought I didn't trust authorities because of my pessimism. My other friend: She's school smart, but doesn't notice corruption. She's Liberal, thinks the virus is truly dangerous, encourages people to "stay safe" and all (she's sweet about it, not rude or aggressive) She believes the media, believes white people are privileged, love is love, thinks that people are Transphobic if they say things like only women menstruate and get pregnant. Religious friend stopped talking to me after graduating. Liberal friend still does. She won't ever think like I do, and I've been worrying with the chaos of this year that our differences will lead to her cutting ties with me. We're both loyal and don't give up on people without good reason so hopefully we'll stay friends.</p>

        <p>This is unrelated but I'd like to point something out. I'm sure that this sub/people on it generally lean toward the idea that the government is trying to divide us/meddle in the affairs of the common folk etc. Most probably believe that the liberal/republican divide is due to misinformation spread by the government, stuff like that.</p>
<p>What I have never understood is that people like us insist on enforcing our own divisions as well, ie: sheep/non-sheep. I mean isn't division exactly what the problem is? Tbh the more likely scenario is that the voice of both sides matters. I think that there are some grains of truth on the "sheep's" narrative as well as on this side's narrative, obviously, which is why I'm here.</p>
<p>I know this is off topic but I feel like sometimes stuff like this subreddit that's meant to be constructive winds up fostering a culture of division similar to those put in place for the gain of the very people we're trying to push back against, and if you're going to limit the source of your information to one single echo chamber ie: exclude any information that follows the "sheep" narrative than you yourself are also a sheep, just in a different flock.</p>

        <p>This is a very centrist position that I used to have myself. However, the events of this year have ended my ability and desire to try and find the middle ground because those writing and supporting the mainstream narrative have responded by not only refusing to find common ground, but have attacked, pilloried, and deplatformed us. We’ve had our own family and friends turn on us because we’ve questioned the narrative and offered data and logic and WE are supposed to roll over and be charitable?</p>
<p>Listen, I know there’s some people on here who have no nuance and just enjoy being contrarians, but a lot of us would change our stance if the data led us there. I have to check my biases regularly because I know I can get caught up in my own narrative and am mad, but I’m not alone in this.</p>

        <p>This is the dumbest way to go about convincing anyone to your point. What do you think when people call you names for your beliefs? Does it make you consider their point? Does it make you listen? Instead of saying ANYTHING that supports your views here, you chose to name call and make that the entire purpose of your post. People like you that are out to win and be “right” are one of the biggest problems with our society. We need to be moving towards discussion and removing our egos and team associations. I don’t know what you think you’re accomplishing with a post like this, but it’s self serving and I’m sure you’re very proud of yourself but making this your identity is sad and speaks a lot to who you are as a person. This should not be encouraged by anyone that truly wants change.</p>

        <p>Whilst I agree with the sentiment it's a bit tricky not to start resenting a society which is literally censoring your views which are based in facts, calling you names and suggesting that you are responsible for killing elderly people, so I think you need to give this guy (and the sub) some room to vent.  I also don't think very many of the general public can be woken up, because by now if you're not already awake, I dunno what anyone can do to change your mind.</p>

        <p>Calling people sheep and saying people aren’t “woke” or need to wake up, is the same dumb terminology the far left uses for everything. It’s the exact same thing. I don’t know how people don’t see that? Discussion is what’s needed. Patting ourselves on the back like this and acting like we’re so much smarter than everyone looks ridiculous just like it looks when people pay themselves on the back for wearing some dumb mask.</p>

        <p>I agree the sheep, i.e., the animal, isn't dumb at all. In fact it's a very gentle creature that just minds its own business. It's the people who we call sheep that are dumb as fuck.</p>
<p>In fact calling them sheep is an insult to sheep the animal, who I have nothing against. I think we should call these people "bots" instead, because that's exactly what they are.</p>
