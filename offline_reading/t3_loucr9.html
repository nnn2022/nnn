    <strong>Work slavery</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone here also have trouble with work being exempt from this madness?</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of working, I think we as a people work too much, but with that said things like canteens, cake etc made the day more fun.</p>
<p>Taking the buses, trains etc filled with people to be at work with many people is okay but going to the barber is not. Seriously why.</p>
<p>Well from being a student with almost 3 month long summer vacations to having just 3 weeks in the summer I just suffered. I was not good enough to find something fun in these 3 weeks and when I returned back to work most of the fun stuff with my friends and the weather became better. I missed out on that.</p>
<p>Playing video games like Satisfactory is freaking amazing and I wish I could take half a year just to dive into games like that or Valheim. BUT I don't find them fun the when working because then time just moves too fast and I need to work again.</p>
<p>I just have gotten too much stuff, consoles to spend time on.</p>
<p>So before Corona I changed Strategy, That I would travel maybe 2-4 weeks out of the 6 weeks of vacation in a year. That these weeks I stayed home I would spend 350$ every week of vacation spend in my country just to have them be different.</p>
<p>Getting the most of the free time I have, like the stereotypical business worker that works 60 hours and then sees goes to Vegas in weekends and does drugs and sees hookers kinda thing.</p>
<p><strong>But restrictions ruined that plan. Now I just work and work and work and save so much money with no use. Even things like new RTX cards and consoles that could bring me joy and excitement I can't buy because they're out of stuck.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No parties, no vacations, Just work work and work.</strong></p>
<p>This has become slavery, could they at least not give us more vacation or reduce work hours under this.</p></p>

        <p>Yep. No more perspective on a somewhat normal life.</p>
<p>Employer still expects me to work hard, which I refuse. I value my time and sanity more than making someone else rich while ihe still can.</p>
<p>Probably get fired soon but so be it.</p>
