    <strong>People are smarter than we gave them credit for</strong>
    <p><p>Apologies for the clickbait headline. It’s there to grab attention with a grain of truth.</p>
<p>My point is this: people have internally consistent arguments for their political beliefs. And make no mistake: the lockdown is a political decision — it is a decision on what the polis or polity should do.</p>
<p>One of the most pernicious mistakes that people make in hindsight is analyzing what the incorrect decision was instead of why it was made. Everyone here will agree that mistakes were made in locking down society, forcing masks on people in public, and accepting untold amounts of 2nd order damage from those decisions. Then, people tend to explain this one of two ways: either people are just <em>dumb</em> or society as we knew it is entirely a facade. This doesn't win friends or influence people. We need to understand people, not just on an emotional level (which is all anyone seems to mean when they call for empathy) but on a logical level. </p>
<p>I've spent some trying to understand people lately, and here's what I've realized. No one understands the philosophical ideals that underpin the views on politics, people, etc that they hold <em>and</em> others hold. If you look at what the underpinning philosophies are, you can see that most people have views consistent with them. Therefore, their logical capacity is not the issue. It is their philosophical capacity.</p>
<p>How can we break this impasse in society? We have to stop being afraid of the term 'idealist'. It's impossible to not follow an ideal. Let's say you're just "pragmatic". Probably what you're thinking that means is utilitarianism, which is consequentialism based upon maximizing outcomes per person. Let's say you have "no values" or are selfish beyond reason — that would make you an egoist, which is a consequentialist philosophy leaning towards self outcomes.</p>
<p>Our governments have decided to pay <em>everything</em> in exchange for a little virtue signaling, maybe a couple lives saved*, and personal and corporate opportunism. The actual cost is incalculable, but according to some philosophies, it was still a worthwhile expense. Do you see now why no amount of evidence will change their minds? The formula that these people have used to calculate the value provided to society by these lockdowns — that is the problem. I don't even want to call it utilitarianism. I would say it is closer to loss aversion — outcomes are weighed according to which has the least loss. Some people believe a single life is worth a billion dollars or putting 1000 people in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>So, in light of the fault at the core of our decision making process, I want to put forward a couple alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>We accept that the government needs significant restrictions, so it cannot wield too much power in weighing the intangible value of life. And when I say "government", I mean everyone who would influence said government too. It doesn't matter 51% of the population wants to put 49% of the population in prison. That's still the wrong thing to do.</li>
<li>We need to accept that human rights have significant limitations, so rather than expand what we include on the list of inalienable rights provided by god or nature, we need to trim that list to core values that we can truly apply to everyone. When we expand that list too much, we end up in an authoritarian regime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Funny... it's almost like the framers of the constitution were onto something.</p>
<p>*I think the weight of evidence is against this, but it's still not acceptable to make the decisions that were made in order to save a few lives if that were in fact an option.</p></p>

        <p>Great in depth look on the philosophy underlying this all. No logic can change them because they don't understand their own values and government has taken full advantage of it to help create this compliance driven nightmare we find ourselves in. I will often hear people be like "I'm so sick of these masks!" but then go on to justify it with the same regurgitated "but if it can save one life!" line of thought and the circus goes on because they can't critically analyze their own views or anyone else's. The "society is a facade" line really hit me hard because I thought about how this lack of philosophical understanding is fueling all sorts of herd chaos. One thing feeds into a another and the loop it goes in is one of the most destructive forces known to man.</p>
