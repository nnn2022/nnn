        <p>This was at the Dutch anti corona hysteria protest 21st of june. Young and old, families and students. All were rightly more concerned about the threat on their freedom than about the 0.6% IFR virus.</p>
<p>I do understand if people do not agree with this expression but hear me out:</p>
<p>A professor of law called this a provocation of judicial integrity of our country. He said the group hug should be punished.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rtvnoord.nl/nieuws/715686/Groepsknuffel-op-Malieveld-is-provocatie-van-rechtsstaat">https://www.rtvnoord.nl/nieuws/715686/Groepsknuffel-op-Malieveld-is-provocatie-van-rechtsstaat</a></p>
<p>I will not apologize for hugging when the police hits a woman holding flowers with bats. Deontologically: hugging is not a crime and consequentialistically: the measures are the provocation, not the hug.</p>
<p>The people in this video tried to ask and reason for their human rights, but they were not heard and our government wants to make it possible for cops to just search your house if they suspect people are in your house.</p>
<p>My brothers girlfriend had the police breaking into her student home with a secret key. Here is her interview with a newspaper: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/politie-betreedt-studentenwoning-uilenstede-met-eigen-sleutel~bc7cdfb3/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj0z6ybn53qAhXH4KQKHZ8FCEIQFjABegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XPkBjq06RVtLGrX4vvObF">https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/politie-betreedt-studentenwoning-uilenstede-met-eigen-sleutel\~bc7cdfb3/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj0z6ybn53qAhXH4KQKHZ8FCEIQFjABegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XPkBjq06RVtLGrX4vvObF</a></p>
<p>Our king said on the 4th of may our WW2 remembrance day, that we should not avert our gaze from injustice. That we should be vigilant: question the people that want to normalize that which should not be normal. Resist if people step on your human rights.</p>
<p>I salute my king and I will not look away any longer. I will not stand idle when injustice and madness threatens our liberty.</p>

        <p>The police came with an army of 30 vans police on horses helicopter and drone. All with riot gear. Most of them were ashamed to arrest families with children. </p>
<p>You can not stop freedom. You can not take away liberty. They only thing that keepes us from liberty is the thought that we can not demand it back from those who take it from us. The lie the corona hysteria people try to make you believe is that you can not make a difference. </p>
<p>You can. And believe me it felt absolutely liberating to stand side by side with the people that value liberty and the pursuit of happiness as much as I do.</p>

        <p>I've been to the Netherlands twice, and I love it so much and love the people there. I am shocked by how bad things are getting there. I never could have imagined this.</p>
<p>I think the protest is beautiful and wish we had more like this in the US.</p>

        <p>Yes I believe so. Although I don't have the numbers available at this time.</p>
<p>I understand this is quite a controversial statement though.</p>
<p>The Dutch gov kept banning these protests and said for fundamental human rights there is no time in crisis. </p>
<p>They feared this would happen. Now people are so fed up and angry that people openly disregard the rules and I understand.</p>
<p>We tried asking for freedom, we tried to comply with the demands in the vain hope that we would be heard.</p>
<p>The government just does what it feels it can get away with.</p>

        <p>TLDR: Dutch like Americans but think they are crazy sometimes. Dutch are indifferent and do not care about you, but they do stay out of your life as a result. Most Dutch do not have deep convictions but are pragmatist and are just tired of the laws. Dutch people warm up to Americans because Dutch people start to realize more and more that the americans distrust for government is not always irrational.</p>
<p>Mainstream media says trump is an idiot. But a lot of people I know actually think he is not as bad as he is made out to be. But that is because MSM keeps overreacting to everything he says or does and sanctifies every other politicians actions. Trump is a major dick, but that does not mean he is always wrong. I prefer the right policy and an asshole president over a well intentioned president smothering us lovingly with orwellian policies. The Dutch have the NOS (national broadcasting agency) and people are getting massively tired of it.</p>
<p>Our national broadcasting agency that was always made out to be 'objective' tried to scare everyone 2 days ago, no new corona deaths but they immediately let someone on our national news broadcast to talk about how her father succumbed to corona and that is dangerous and not to be underestimated. Mainstream media keeps on trying to sell the NOS news as objective but it does not really fly anymore if you talk to normal people, I already knew they were not objective. But a lot of Dutch people are starting to realise it too.</p>
<p>The Dutch are quite excentric. They are brutally direct and also usually quite skeptical of authority. They think they know everything better than everyone else, and in this case it is a great trait haha. Only really annoying thing about the Dutch in my opinion is that they can be unfriendly and try to put it under the guise of directness, and some of them can be very morally sanctimonious. Again the directness and stubborn nature. But that depends on whether you ask, because they are also very indifferent (not tolerant) to other people's identity.</p>
<p>Our country is quite progressive, but also quite individualistic. The state helps the poor, but the dutch put a very big emphasis on the individual. If you want to use drugs go ahead, it is your responsibility. That is an example of how that works out. In my street in the Hague people were chilling with people all the time and laughing about this whole thing. Nobody wears mouth masks except when they are mandatory in trains and the media desperately tries to make it seem like a reasonable thing. It does not work I just put it on my chin like a lot of other people. Honestly I can hear them laughing right now about the "major" threat.</p>
<p>The Dutch used to think the Americans are crazy, but a lot of Dutch people are really starting to respect the Americans more and more in my surrounding for also being skeptical of authority. The Dutch and the Americans have their differences. A lot of Dutch people think Americans are superficial, overly patriotic and loud. But that sentiment honestly is starting to change. Americans are like the Dutch in that they are independent thinkers (more so than the Dutch), they are also individualistic and value freedom. It is no wonder that both countries rebelled against their rulers to create a republic. Honestly I really like Americans because unlike the Dutch they stand up more for their deep convictions. Dutch people do not have them so much, they do not really rebel because of freedom or patriotism but because they are tired of the ridiculousness and think like this:</p>
<p>"We did the dance and now please bother other people."</p>
<p>That is the tolerance of Dutch people, you think they approve but actually they do not care. It is not tolerance that is Dutch but an insane amount of indifference towards your sexual orientation, drug consumption.</p>
<p>The war on drugs is an example of the difference of American and Dutch because the Dutch are not interested in what you put in your body, and are indifferent to your potential abuse. Americans would either value the freedom or see drugs as the devil in my view. They do care about you sort of. The Dutch put up with the corona laws for quite a time because they share less deep convictions about freedom, but they really are annoyed by the nuisance of these laws and the longetivity.</p>
<p>The Americans rebel because of deep conviction mostly, the Dutch rebel in that they are heroicly indifferent.</p>
<p>Great example is Black Pete. The Dutch like you and suddenly they get angry with you because they feel you want to meddle in their slightly offensive affairs (their perspective) and they are like: "leave me alone like I leave you alone to do your slightly offensive things." They are indifferent but do not intrude on them because they will get angry. It is because they leave you alone too although they can be blunt. When Americans bring up Black Pete, the Dutch feel offended because the Dutch smugly feel their society is more just to black people and feel that they are being polite by minding their own business. They generally reprocitate by pointing out everything you do wrong and that they did not feel they had to call out. They are indifferent but expect the same from you. </p>
<p>Long post sorry for that but I really liked the question.</p>

        <p>Americans love Dutch people.  In Michigan we had a huge Dutch settlement and there's a town called Holland with an hugely popular Tulip festival. </p>
<p>I think Freedom is going to win in the end because it's better. That's why both our countries had lots of immigration from despotic and backward places, people want the better style. But we have to be somewhat confident in our Freedom heritage or the bad ways take hold. For instance, the Russian immigration to America started with them wanting Freedom, but now they think they can lock us down. No, we have to set them straight, for their own good.</p>
<p>Thanks for the inspiring video, good luck!</p>

        <p>Yeah, I don’t understand how wanting our rights and freedom back became so political!! They assume everyone is automatically a Trump supporter when you speak out about how silly all the restrictions are... I have an equal hatred for all politicians, no matter the party... But if I were to post a mask selfie, or the hashtag #stayhomesavelives, or something like that, I’d be adored and loved by all... I’m curious to know how many people are just faking it on Facebook and such, and really have the same thoughts and opinions as us??</p>

        <p>I share your sentiment wholeheartedly. </p>
<p>Honestly I find it hilarious that I thought trump was a clown, but now I see the other politicians are part of the circus too. It is a funny world to live in where the man that gets compared to hitler the most is the one that is actively trying to stop a few orwellian measures. Don't misunderstand me I do not support the man, but neither do I support Biden.</p>
<p>Trump does not give a fuck about people dying of the virus. He is not concerned with being the savior because he is an asshole, and that is exactly the attitude that would get us our freedom back right now. He is so unashamed that he does not even pretend to really care and that apathy is what makes him less vulnerable to moral shame and mass hysteria. He is so stubborn that he considers himself the highest authority. He does not  even pretend to care about us enough to save us from a threat, but that is what enables him to be pro freedom.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I am in a sort of bizarre alternative universe.</p>

        <p>I had an obnoxious aquiantance who thought telling me that I'm "using similar arguments to trump supporters therefore your position is bad" was a valid argument. </p>
<p>God I hated him. It wasn't even about being liberal. He would demonize anyone to the left of him and anyone to the right of him. He got temporarily banned from our discord for verbally abusing me during a discussion when I said that it is disingenuous to blame Trump for George Floyd's death and the police response to the protests. In response to being temporarily banned he said that "he knows his behavior was inappropriate but he chooses not to participate in a group rather than change it"</p>
<p>On a second thought he was pretty funny...</p>

        <p>Meet up with the normal people, half of the population here atleast does not care for the measures anymore. I shake everyone's hand. The media and reddit make it seem like everybody supports this but is a vocal minority that does. Atleast that is what I believe.</p>

        <p>Beautiful to see. I ashamed of my fellow countrymen in the UK although Brixton massive did fuck up some police last night so fair play to them. Nobody seems brave enough to have a genuine protest though. </p>
<p>We're all so far from our humanity. At least it's not like this everywhere. I need to get out of here.</p>

        <p>We have a group called "virus madness" that is organizing lawsuits and organizing protests against the measures. They took the lead, the mayor forbid it because they would have been DJ's and dancing. They forbid it because it was a protest that was also a festival. But the thing is that the festival was a protest because the protest had DJ's to protest draconian disproportional measures. But a lot of people still came. There were some nasty individuals that the police did take care of, so I do feel that they did well with those people. But that was all the positive that could be said about them.</p>
<p>The problem is they also arrested these people, one of the chief officers yelled at me they were getting "de harde kern" which is what you refer to when you talk about the violent football hooligan inner circle. They arrested all these people while they were chanting "liberty". Everyone of all ages were asking the police what they would tell their children when they get home. Or what happens with all the sexual assault cases that get poor investigation because of police shortages. </p>
<p>They sent an army for a group of all ages chanting "liberty".</p>
<p>Saturday is the next protest I believe and I for sure am going to be there.</p>
<p>I have footage of that day I can put it in a comment.</p>

        <p>30 police got injured trying to shut down a street party. </p>
<p>Meanwhile 1000s gather in Liverpool to celebrate the football and no attempt by police to stop them. Only state sanctioned celebrations are allowed at the moment apparently. </p>
<p>When I voice my complaints to normal people about this they think I'm being an idiot. Football important - Music not important. Protesting for freedom and against the government thinking it's OK to tell us when we can sleep with a loved one or not is not important - protesting about police brutality that didn't even occur in your country when millions of similar injustices happen every day and nobody bats an eyelid, very, very important. </p>
<p>Sorry to rant I'm just done. I don't understand how people are putting up with this. Open the fucking gyms morons.</p>

        <p>This is beautiful. Thank you to all the Dutch who do this. My country has a festival on July 19th which is <strong>the most</strong> popular festival. Vartavar. The water festival. Everyone, everywhere in the city goes out and has a huge waterfight from morning till night. I'm hoping that the whole country says no to anymore restrictions and goes out that day to celebrate like normal.</p>

        <p>Go out and enjoy it with the people who show up. The people that oppose your festival won't be attending. Let them rage as they maybe see pictures of people having fun. They have no power over you. They seem like the majority but that is only because they never go out and live on the internet in perpetual fear. Only watch out for overzealous authority presence, apart from them no one can withold you from enjoying your life.</p>

        <p>This is a wacky site, but I can promise you the footage of this day is real. Here you can look at some of the footage of the police performance against these "criminals": <a href="https://www.niburu.co/binnenland/15260-false-flag-aanval-malieveld-mislukt">https://www.niburu.co/binnenland/15260-false-flag-aanval-malieveld-mislukt</a>.

        <p>This is the first time I have felt something resembling genuine hope in I don't know how many months. Thank you for sharing! 💘 The Netherlands is one of my favorite countries in the world, and it makes me happy to see people there standing up against insane authoritarian measures.

        <p>I completely understand this is controversial and I respect you are not doing this. If you do not support this I value you for it.</p>
<p>I also understand if some will hate this. </p>
<p>Why I am doing this is because the narrative changed, the goalpost were shifted. Now corona is not a threat but the rules cant go because it is still there and that is what I feared.</p>
<p>Corona is gone when there is a vaccination but until that time things wont be normal unless everybody violates the rules so much that they are essentially void.</p>
<p>They ban protest because of the corona rules and I am out of patience. I will not listen or adhere to oppression any longer.</p>
<p>Corona policy can not be chamberlained out of I think. It needs an active  disregard for the rules. </p>
<p>What you do not fight they will try to do.</p>
