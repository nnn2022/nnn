        <p>So using tests that give false positives damn near every single time, calling every death a Covid death, and giving Covid credit for all the flu and cardiac deaths isn't enough?</p>
<p>I keep saying it:. If Covid was so deadly, all of the essential jobs would be gone because the workers would have been dropping like flies.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns drive mortality down, but excess deaths are above the confirmed number of COVID deaths- that tells us it's an undercount.</p>
<p>Essential workers are getting hit harder, it's why this virus is disproportionately killing black and working class americans.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns have been attributed to an increase in suicides, death due to untreated medical conditions (not covid), and drug and alcohol overdoses.  Also don't forget all the people killed by BLM and Antifa rioters.   And of course all the democratic state governors who locked up covid patients inside nursing homes by refusing to let nursing homes send the covid patients to the hospitals.  That caused most of the ACTUAL covid deaths right there.  New York, Michigan, New Jersey, and a few others were the ones responsible for that.  </p>
<p>2020 was a bloodbath, but very little of it can actually be attributed to covid-19.  If it hadn't been for the Blue State Governors and their nursing home orders, covid wouldn't have killed nearly as many people as it did.</p>

        <p>Total nonsense, you're telling about fractions of total death counts. While suicide and homicide may have risen, they would not account for the depressed mortality caused by a nationwide shutdown. That's why mortality even fell during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Right now South Dakota has higher total mortality than nearly every country on earth. We don't need to compare one state to another, we can just look at the EU.</p>

        <p>Show me a source that specifically deals with suicides this year and show me where that source states that they are just barely a fraction of a percent higher than they were last year.  I'll wait.</p>
<p>And show me clear and concise testing in South Dakota that proves that people are not only being PROPERLY diagnosed with covid-19, but also that they are dying more in South Dakota than in any other state- keep in mind that influenza has the exact same symptoms and also that the New York Times has published an article showing that the PCR test only has a 10% accuracy- AND the court in Portugal has made an official ruling against the PCR test because it's so inaccurate.</p>

        <p>Also, there still is no way to confirm a covid death.  The tests being used are horribly broken (proven) and the symptoms as reported by the CDC are identicle to influenza.  Unless you can quote a confirmed test with an explanation of why it isn't being made available to any of the testing sights world-wide, then there is no way to confirm covid-19.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the virus is fake- I'm saying that none of the testing sights or doctors are actually confirming covid-19.</p>

        <p>Since we can't tell when someone dies whether or not they had covid, because we're using "recent PCR positive" as the primary criteria, some portion of the current covid deaths...aren't.  The stats seem to show that 97% of the 35+ cycle positives aren't live virus, and most labs in the country are running 35-45 cycles (friend at a lab in maryland says they run 40-42 per the mfr directions).</p>
<p>That's a lot of potential overcounts!</p>
<p>edit: the second criteria is "probably covid" based on symptoms...which are cold symptoms.  given this is cold season, there's rather a lot of that around.  per cdc instructions and intention (march 24 covid note #2), we're counting covid "more often than not."</p>

        <p>There are all sorts of new bayesian models coming out for PCR tests, and yeah there's definitely room for a lot of false positives.</p>
<p>That's why in the face of that uncertainty we have to look at output metrics, like expected and actual mortality. If the lockdowns should driving mortality down (including by severely hampering this years spread of influenza), then those excess deaths cannot be explained by other sources.</p>

        <p>Running a pcr at high cycles isn't a false positive, its working as intended. Pcr is not designed to detect live virus.</p>
<p>Most countries have no more excess deaths this year than the usual cycle of mild/strong flu seasons.</p>

        <p>Because lockdowns and economic recessions would otherwise drive the death rate down (we are driving, working, laboring, interacting less)- our excess deaths this year, upwards of 300k, can likely be attributed to the virus.</p>

        <p>... Right. Jammed up hospitals with fewer staff available make it so people can't receive critical care for other things and can lead to more deaths. Not being able to make a doctor's appointment can lead to illnesses or things like cancer being undiagnosed and treated and can lead to more deaths. All of this is because of the pandemic</p>

        <p>Hospitals aren't jammed up, they just canceled all non-emergent surgeries, then laid off staff because there were so few patients.  Being too afraid to make a doctor's appointment, get cancer screenings or vaccinations isn't a product of the pandemic, it's a product of the fearmongering.</p>

        <p>They're getting jammed up now. Where I live we just hit a critical point where the amount of patients needing ICU care is at the capacity we're able to provide without affecting other services in the hospitals. So now resources and personnel are going to be pulled away from non-COVID areas to help out in ICUs. So your knee surgery or X-rays might have to wait because the nurses that would help out are being redirected to help with COVID.</p>
<p>In the summer, it wasn't as bad and medical professionals were telling people that it was ok to go to the emergency room, but yes it's true people were scared. Pandemic's are scary, not just because of fearmongering, but because it's actually a threat. It's a threat that isn't just another country made up of people that we can shoot at if we make enough guns. It's an invisible virus that does not think and does not care about who you are and what you believe. That's a scary thought to a lot of people so it's natural to be afraid.</p>

        <p>It's a threat with a 0.083% IFR for 17-69, according to the danes....  It's a threat to those who are severely ill, immunocompromised, or morbidly obese.  To the healthy, it isn't a threat.  To the young, it's LESS of a threat than any given flu.  It's less of a threat than countless other things we do all the time.</p>
<p>People are scared when they're told to be scared, like with H1N1 a few years back.  And if they're not told to be scared, they attend woodstock during a pandemic that killed more that covid has, even without adjusting for population.</p>
<p>Hospitals get busy EVERY year during cold and flu season.  There are hospitals that fill up, send patients to nearby hospitals, even declare states of emergency, and we STILL take care of cancer patients and childhood vaccinations.  This year isn't even as bad as the 2017-2018 flu in terms of hospital use. </p>
<p>Regardless, if people are dying in their homes of heart attacks, it isn't because of anything to do with hospital overcrowding, it's because the politicians and media have told them not to risk it, for which they should be ashamed, and then charged.</p>

        <p>Flu hits people like a ton of bricks.  Some colds do too.  Colds even kill people, or make them vulnerable to viral or bacterial pneumonia that they can then no longer fight off.  People report cold symptoms lingering for weeks at a time.  This isn't uncommon in the slightest.  Also, many people who "say they are healthy" are actually overweight, or a healthy weight, but still get no exercise and thus aren't actually healthy.  </p>
<p>By multiple estimates, including the WHO, several hundred million people have had covid.  Most didn't know it, some had mild cold symptoms, and yes, some had severe symptoms or even died.  If a small but loud group says that they're perfectly healthy but it still kicked their asses, they're either incorrect, or they're the anomaly.  With 800 million cases, even one in a million events happen enough to get noticed (like the handful of reinfections!)  Remember that a significant portion of the "long covid" crowd have never even tested positive for covid, making their self diagnoses and symptoms lists most likely explained by something else.  Additionally, when we look at a population where tens of millions have been infected and they're told to be afraid, they may incorrectly attribute symptoms to covid without any scientific basis.  This is the central issue with such anecdotal ramblings.</p>

        <p>I'm just confused by what you're trying to prove here. This report is saying deaths are higher than normal in the U.S. and not every one of those extra deaths are directly caused by COVID-19, meaning those people didn't get the actual disease. This is because people in hard hit areas have been unable or unwilling to get treatment for other medical issues. </p>
<p>In a way you can attribute these extra deaths to the pandemic because if it was a normal year, a good number of those people would have received proper medical care and might not have died.</p>

<p>Hospitals are forgoing elective, not non-elective procedures. The only  way to explain the bulk of the 300k additional deaths is COVID, according to most epidemiologists.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns are driving death rates <em>up</em>. People are missing diagnoses for things like cancer because they couldn’t get routine medical care for a while. People were dying at home of other issues because they were too afraid to go to the hospital or couldn’t get an appt if it wasn’t an “emergency” and then it quickly became one. We know a woman in our town who had a baby at home because they scared her out of going to do it in the hospital, she had complications and died. Suicides, overdoses, mental health crises-it’s all shooting up at an alarming rate.  My friend works in the ICU. Guess what she’s seen far more of than covid? Attempted suicides. And what’s this about driving and laboring being down? Traffic has been awful where I am since May and the laborers were considered essential in most places. I guess with offices being closed that lowers the risk of communicable disease transmission there, but the vast majority of the workforce isn’t at a huge risk of dying from the common communicable diseases we see so this really has no great impact.</p>

Pardon my French but all I have been hearing from my friends and family who work in hospitals is that they’re seeing suicides at an alarming rate and overdoses like never before. I’ve heard estimates that the numbers are 3x what is “typical”. Unfortunately states and counties are shit at tracking suicides so there’s no definitive number but it’s all I’ve been hearing from those who are experiencing it firsthand. </p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest every excess death is from the virus as you claim. If you feel there’s no concrete evidence for my point then it’s the same right back for yours. Believe what you will but it’s simply daft to not realize how lockdowns <em>cause</em> deaths down the road and pave a path of destruction when it comes to health and wellness.</p>
