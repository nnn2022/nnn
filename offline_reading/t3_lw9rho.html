    <strong>Testing positive for influenza A *and* influenza B after covid vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know if anyone has heard of this. I have a friend who was telling me that she had just had her second covid vaxx, and that, overall, the side effects were worse than any other vaccine she'd ever had. It had been a little over a week, and she said she was glad to start feeling normal again.</p>
<p>She also mentioned that after her *first* round of vaccinations, she got incredibly sick for over two weeks and tested positive for both influenza A and influenza B. She said she had been compulsive about mask wearing, social distancing, and only using curbside instead of shopping, so the only place she could have gotten sick was the hospital when she went in for her covid vaccine.</p>
<p>Has anyone else heard of this as a side effect? (I didn't bring it up to her, because she's a big covid believer.)</p></p>

        <p>I worked as a Medical laboratory technologist. Being positive for both Influenza A &amp; B is exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>I could say it's a coincidence but, 
Something is wrong with this vaccine...</p>

        <p>Well considering it's an experimental DNA altering gene therapy, it's hardly surprising. There's been no animal testing and testing for long term safety, and it has only been approved for emergency use with pharmaceutical companies having no indemnity for injury or death.</p>
<p>If you go to r/CovidVaccinated, the list of side effects are extensive and growing.</p>
<p>I'd say she's got more serious problems than testing positive for influenza A and B in store, but who really knows.</p>
