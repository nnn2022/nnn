    <strong>Lurkers: here is your opportunity to convert a COVID vaccine skeptic</strong>
    <p><p>I will book an appointment with my local vaccination clinic for the next available time slot and post proof if someone can satisfactorily answer these rather simple questions. </p>
<p>First: Let's assume that 10 years down the road it is discovered that the COVID vaccines led to a new, unstudied, serious, and untreatable health condition similar to how Creutzfeldt-Jakob/Mad Cow Disease affects you horribly after the long-term asymptomatic latent phase.</p>
<p>For the sake of this discussion, let's assume that this theoretical Syndrome XYZ is guaranteed to exist in the future, and is not just a possibility. I do not want to debate the odds of this happening, as they are irrelevant to my concerns. We will be discussing the worst-case doomsday scenario here.</p>
<p>Who and/or what will ensure that I am spared the deleterious effects? </p>
<p>I do not want to hear about how "it's safe, bro." These vaccines are using technology that has never been used in a widely-distributed shot even once in human history. </p>
<p>None of the COVID-19 vaccines have been in public use for more than a year, as the disease was not known to the world until very recently. MRNA vaccines have never seen widespread use to prevent any disease. Those are not my opinions, those are facts.</p>
<p>With regards to these specific shots, there is no way to assess longitudinal data regarding safety or efficacy to my satisfaction within this timeframe. </p>
<p>Someone will probably post the analogy of "you don't worry about what eating a PBJ will do 10 years down the road. If you were allergic, you would go into shock immediately. </p>
<p>The vaccine is the same. If scientists don't see side effects within a month or two of a vaccine being released, they probably won't ever see them." </p>
<p>That may be true for a PBJ, but staying with the food analogies, if you eat beef, you are at risk of contracting a prion disease such as Mad Cow/Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.</p>
<p>In that case specifically, it could lie dormant for decades within your body before suddenly turning your brain into a sponge. </p>
<p>This is why there was a multi-decade long ban on donating blood for US servicemembers who had been to Europe during BSE outbreaks.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that nobody was showing symptoms of Mad Cow, it was still very possible that someone could have eaten tainted beef and be carrying the disease without knowing, even decades after exposure. </p>
<p>If this happened with this vaccine, you might never know you were sick until one day, years down the road, you become a sufferer of Syndrome XYZ. </p>
<p>Second: In the event that such a condition does arise, how will they be curing it before I personally suffer? </p>
<p>Whether or not this truly applies to me, let's assume I have absolutely zero sense of civic responsibility, and cannot be enticed by the prospect of "saving the vulnerable." </p>
<p>Let's posit that I'm the most insufferably selfish person on Earth, and care zero about anyone but myself. </p>
<p>Without referring to "sacrificing yourself for the common good" and saying I should be willing to overlook potential risks and take it to save others, how can I be assured that I will never personally suffer as a result of taking the vaccine? </p>
<p>Third: What do I stand to personally gain from taking it? Once again, assume that I am the world's most selfish person and cannot be motivated by the prospect of sacrifice for others. </p>
<p>Given that I am a healthy young person who already got sick with COVID and recovered, I have zero fear of the virus and see no personal need to take the vaccine when the disease posed statistically no risk to me. </p>
<p>If there is a long-term risk from contracting the disease, there is not much I can do to avoid it at this point. </p>
<p>I don't buy into the whole "arbitrary restriction of rights and collective punishment" idea, so claiming that I will get my freedom back should I get vaccinated doesn't work. </p>
<p>The state I live in has already opened back up, and banned vaccine passports by private business as well as government agencies. There is no leverage in that regard. </p>
<p>Getting a vaccine will (at least for now) make no difference in my ability to participate in anything. </p>
<p>Fourth: If we do end up finding out that these vaccines are dangerous down the road, what personal consequences are there for those who were responsible for harming me? </p>
<p>We saw a good number of healthcare workers develop narcolepsy as a result of taking improperly-studied swine flu shots mandated as a condition of their employment during the 2008 pandemic. </p>
<p>Their lives have been ruined - permanent narcolepsy is one of the worst fates you could suffer. </p>
<p>Yet they have not been (and cannot be) properly recompensed for their suffering, and nobody has faced consequences for developing the vaccines that led to their injuries or coercing them into taking them. </p>
<p>Why would this shot be any different? Vaccine makers cannot be sued in the US. Even if they could, none of the people responsible will be held personally liable. </p>
<p>The only thing that would happen if they could be held liable (which they can't be) is that the company would be sued, bankrupted, and liquidated, and the people that created the dangerous product will move onto other jobs. There is no personal skin in the game for them. </p>
<p>See what happened to Purdue for creating the Opioid Epidemic. The company dissolved, and nearly everyone responsible was let off the hook. </p>
<p>Why would I trust a product from someone who is not liable if their product harms me? </p>
<p>Regardless of how safe the "Science" is with regards to what they were selling, I would not purchase food from an organization that had a legal exemption from any and all liability. </p>
<p>I would not want to risk them believing that they could cut corners on safety protocols and sell me tainted products. </p>
<p>If they can't be held liable, why would they not just pocket the money they would have spent on ensuring safety? These are for-profit organizations, not charities. They exist to maximize profits. </p>
<p>If their products were 100% safe as many vaccine supporters claim, why would the companies not want to be legally liable? It could be a badge of honor for them. </p>
<p>They could say, "look, we've created a product so safe that nobody could ever be harmed by it. We have zero concerns about lawsuits, because we have definitive proof that our product could not cause harm."</p>
<p>If it were that safe, and the science were that sound, their teams of expensive and high-powered lawyers would surely have no problems dealing with any frivolous or bogus lawsuits filed by people trying to get rich quick. </p>
<p>If the science were that sound, the fraudulent plaintiffs would be laughed out of court and forced to pay the attorneys' fees for the company they sued.</p>
<p>You might say, "well, people would not patronize them if they were hocking dangerous products. The free market would weed them out." </p>
<p>For regular products, that might be true, or it might not. But when much of the country is required to get vaccinated as a condition of being able to even participate in society, and there is a legally-mandated liability exemption for the entire industry, one cannot shop around and find a producer that could be held responsible. </p>
<p>There is no free market or choice when monopolies and coercion are involved. Right now in the US, you have four options for COVID vaccines, if you are even permitted to choose at the time of your appointment. In many situations, you are given one at random. </p>
<p>Fifth: Why would I want to get the vaccine and give further credence to the idea that the powers that be can make our natural rights conditional? </p>
<p>By taking it, I am just another brick in the Great Wall of "hey look, these people will do whatever we tell them without question so long as we take away their rights and then claim that we will give them back once they comply with our mandates." </p>
<p>While my state may currently prevent vaccination from being a qualification to return to normalcy, at the federal level, they will be looking at the level of support among the population for these measures. </p>
<p>The same goes for big business, which is currently watching to see if vaccine passports will be something they should require to patronize their establishment. </p>
<p>If they see that 90% will get vaccinated if coerced or enticed, they will have no problem mandating future vaccines or vaccine credentials at a federal level which would preempt any state-level initiatives to preserve bodily autonomy. </p>
<p>I do not wish to condone that behavior and be a part of setting the precedent that the powers that be can coerce or force the public into giving up control over their bodies. </p>
<p>To conclude, as I said at the beginning, if anyone can satisfactorily assuage all of my concerns listed here, I will get the shot ASAP and provide proof. </p>
<p>I welcome debate, as long as it does not degenerate to ad hominem attacks.</p></p>

        <p>This is a virus with an IFR of .15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>

        <p>That's quite the assumption there. I am not a rugged individualist, quite the opposite. I believe strongly in collectivism, but it must be voluntary and not coerced or forced. </p>
<p>If anything, I would consider myself a communist. I believe that people should live in small communities where everyone shares everything and comes together to help each other in their times of need, like we did for most of human history until we became industrialized and social cohesion was lost.</p>
<p>Mandated sacrifice for the nebulous "public good" leads to awful things. I am of the belief that people are naturally good and empathetic and will help others without being forced to do so, if given the chance. </p>
<p>If someone is mandating sacrifice, it is almost never to help the weak. It is almost always to benefit the already-powerful.</p>
<p>Ideally, those who are healthy and able would take measures to protect those who are not. The corollary to that is that those that are disabled and infirm would not demand that their peers sacrifice their autonomy to protect them. </p>
<p>I wrote this post from the point of view of someone who is, for lack of a better word, a sociopath. They have no shame, disregard societal pressure, and cannot be motivated by empathy. This is from the point of view of someone with absolutely no care for anyone but themselves. </p>
<p>It is solely about logic - how do you convince the most antisocial person possible to get a vaccine? Without considering emotional arguments or appeals to authority, what purely logical arguments are there for someone with this point of view to get a vaccine?</p>
<p>There is a startling amount of folks in the US that will not be motivated by ethos or pathos. To reach herd immunity, they cannot be easily dismissed. </p>
<p>And with regards to fearing authority and the medical establishment - you must be privileged. I was raised in a place where the authorities have had (and continue to have) absolutely zero qualms about committing atrocities against those they view as lesser.</p>
<p>I was raised in a place where access to quality medical care is a concept that people in other places get to experience. </p>
<p>I was raised in a place where there are few hospitals, almost all of the available healthcare professionals are criminally incompetent or corrupt, and the medical establishment has used my neighbors in unethical human experimentation.</p>
<p>I have legitimate reasons based on firsthand experiences to not trust those institutions and authorities. If you don't, consider yourself lucky that the only way you will find out about authority abusing power is through reading a book.</p>

        <p>Collectivism is a dangerous mentality in a setting where those who thrive are universally those who seek personal empowerment through energy exchange. I’d be interested to learn how you think the diffusion of your own power amongst your community has served to empower you. It is true that you give what you get in our world, but I believe there is a certain threshold of empowerment that must be reached by the individual before she can begin spreading this power to those worthy of it. Collectivism is dangerous in that it expects all individuals to give of their power equally in order to empower a highly abstract group that is cohesive only because of arbitrary labels applied to it in the guise of sociological differences from the whole of humanity (yet another abstraction). 
Unless your collectivism is of the extremely rare type where each individual is truly equal to all the others, I don’t see this as a practical reality. Collectivism and communism inevitably end up disempowering the masses in order to further empower the state or ruling body they are subject to.</p>

        <p>I would agree with what you said. </p>
<p>Collectivism cannot be applied to a large-scale society. There is simply no way to ensure accountability for those in power, nor is there any way to ensure that individual rights are protected. You are right - they would "disempower the masses." If you have "masses," collectivism cannot work.</p>
<p>If you tried to apply it to a large-scale society, you would just create a new class of people who own everything, but instead of owning it as private individuals they own it as state officials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the issues with allocation and production of resources become far more complicated. This is especially the case when dealing with pre-existing resources (such as a landlord who does not want to cede his land for collective use.) </p>
<p>It is not possible to do this fairly, as it would be a rarity if someone willingly gave up everything that they own. You would have to take it forcefully in that situation, which is contrary to the belief in a free society. Individual rights must be respected before the collective can be considered truly representative of all.</p>
<p>The division of labor complicates things much more, once you factor in how specialized so many of our jobs are. It becomes impossible to properly compensate people for their labor. </p>
<p>That is why there has never and will never be a successful communist/socialist nation. We have seen the atrocities of large-scale collectivism in the former USSR and Maoist China. You cannot hope to collectivize a pre-existing non-collectivist society. </p>
<p>You would have to create a new one, where people willingly signed up. The only way a collectivist "society" could work would be if everyone were there of their own volition, as opposed to being forced or coerced to take part in it. </p>
<p>You would also never be able to have a particularly "modern" society either, and you would more or less be living a very minimalistic and natural lifestyle. That would have to be something that all members of the society agreed to prior to it being formed.</p>
<p>Once it formed, all the members would be collective owners of the means of survival, as I would term it. Nobody would be able to individually lay claim to the land, water, food supply, buildings, medical supplies, means of self defense, etc. </p>
<p>Everyone would be required to fulfill their specific role in the group, and in turn they would get access to what the rest of the group produces. Someone will be the farmer, someone will be the teacher, someone will be the builder, and everyone will have food, education, and a place to sleep.</p>
<p>For the individual, it really wouldn't be much different than how it is right now. Instead of receiving money for your labor, though, you would receive essentials and membership within the community.</p>
<p>Another key aspect to the type of collectivism I envision is that deference to the "greater good" must be voluntary. Similar to what I said in another comment, it would go something like this:</p>
<p>"If there were a sick or disabled person, I would help them of my own volition. In turn, they would not demand that I sacrifice my freedom or autonomy to do so."</p>
<p>In other words, aid for the most vulnerable would be provided, but individual freedoms and autonomy would be preserved. One would expect that everyone comes together to help those in need, but they would not be required to do so "or else."</p>
<p>We see this happen all the time in our current society. When natural disaster strikes, people will willingly line up to help and do things such as donate blood and food, remove debris, and rebuild the homes of their neighbors. </p>
<p>Nobody forces them to do so - we are an inherently social species, and we are innately wired to strongly abhor the suffering of our peers. We have a tendency to help one another, especially if we have deep connections with those we are helping.</p>
<p>Once you have a large-scale society, peoples' willingness to sacrifice to help others drops greatly. </p>
<p>This is especially so if the sacrifice will cause immediate suffering to the individual doing it, but will not create immediate and visible relief from suffering that the one doing the sacrificing will be able to see.</p>
<p>To give an example - say that you were walking around a nearby lake, and the 5 year old neighbor girl wanders away from her parents and decides to jump in, but she can't swim. Her parents don't notice she is missing, and are not around to help. You are the only person nearby.</p>
<p>You are wearing a new suit, have a wallet full of cash, and your phone in your pocket. To save her, you would have to jump in immediately, ruining everything on your person. There would not be time to take everything off first. </p>
<p>Most people if they saw that happening would jump in and save the little girl, even if it meant quite substantial personal loss. Very few people would rather the little girl drown in front of them. They would rather help her, even if it meant sacrificing greatly themselves. </p>
<p>Let's say the total money lost for you in this situation is $1000.</p>
<p>Now, let's say you live in New York City. You hear that there is a homeless, orphaned 5 year old girl in India that is starving to death, suffering from horrific but easily treatable diseases, and at risk of dying from exposure to the elements at any given point. The cost to fix all that and save her life? $1000.</p>
<p>Would you give the $1000 to help her? Probably not. Does that make you a bad or sociopathic person? No. She only exists as a faraway abstraction to you, whereas the neighbor girl was familiar and suffering right before your eyes. </p>
<p>When you pay taxes for welfare programs that you don't benefit from, you will immediately see the hit to your paycheck. That is money you cannot use that you worked hard to earn. </p>
<p>You don't see the little kid that gets dinner tonight because of the food stamps you paid for.</p>
<p>However, if you ever fail to pay those taxes, you will be forcibly taken and thrown into prison. You do not choose to help that little kid that you will never see or know; you have zero say in the matter.</p>
<p>This will naturally breed resentment and an anger towards collectivism. Why wouldn't it? Why would anyone want to sacrifice for what they perceive to be nothing?</p>
<p>This is why collectivism could work on a small scale, and why it doesn't work at a large one. Sacrificing for the good of others does not work when you feel that it is not voluntary and you don't personally see the positive impacts of your actions.</p>
<p>There are successful communes that exist today, and they have existed throughout all of human history. They cannot be densely-populated, and they must be comprised of individuals that deeply trust one another. </p>
<p>That trust, consent of the governed, or whatever you would like to call it is essential for any form of government, but especially a collectivist one where there is such a risk for abuse of power.</p>
<p>There would have to be well-established safeguards to ensure that power could not be exploited or used as a weapon, and the group could never get large in number. At most, there could be a couple hundred members, but even that is risking an eventual loss of social cohesion and trust. </p>
<p>It would be best to keep it around 50 to 100 members, as that seems to be where social scientists (as well as my anecdotes) have found that social cohesion starts to disappear. </p>
<p>To summarize, the type of collectivism I'm referring to would mostly be just living in nature in a very minimalistic manner. We see people form groups like that all the time, and it definitely is possible to have a successful collectivist society in that case. </p>
<p>Such a society would have to place a major emphasis on the rights of individuals to maintain their autonomy and rights, and it would have to be small-scale and very simplistic. But it is definitely doable.</p>
