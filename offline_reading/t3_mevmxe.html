    <strong>If asking someone to get a driver’s license within four years to vote is racist, how is asking someone to get vaccinated not considered racist?</strong>
    <p><p>Think about it. Both are relatively easy to get if you want. </p>
<p>But, for some reason people say it’s racist to require someone to get an ID to vote because not everyone is smart enough to acquire one. </p>
<p>Can I say I’m not smart enough to obtain the vaccination, and anyone who degraded me is just a racist? </p>
<p>Also, does someone have to show ID when getting their vaccination?</p></p>

        <p>same thing with the vaccine pass. if they think "POC" cant get a normal ID to vote, how the hell are they gonna expect them to have a smartphone, get the jab, download the app, and have medical info on the app.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if voter id is racist, so is vaccine passes</p>

        <p>actually, vaccination and medical experimentation has a long history of being incredibly racially motivated and racially biased towards minorities. </p>
<p>Not an SJW thing, either- other than the obvious Nazi example, Tuskegee experiments, Henrietta Lacks etc, gynaecology was founded by a guy experimenting on the bodies of slaves and up to the 60s, black women were being sterilized during routine procedures like appendectomies and minor surgery by racist doctors who wanted to control the black population- whether this was a more personal or social/recc’d by higher ups belief. All of this is pretty mainstream, and predates “everything is racism” arguments by decades. </p>
<p>So when you see “Black people are the most likely to die of covid and NEED this vaccine!” just think... why are people so eager to target a very specific minority population to force an experimental treatment on to them...?</p>
