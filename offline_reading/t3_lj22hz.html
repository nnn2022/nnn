    <strong>Tell Tale Signs of a Cult - The NHS</strong>
    <p><p>It's interesting how an obscure Guardian article from 12 years ago can perfectly describe the absolute tyranny that is the cult of the NHS in Britain.</p>
<p>1 - A Charismatic Leader who increasingly becomes the object of worship. We might here substitute Boris as they've tried to keep him 'politically neutral' in all of this, suffering under Coronavirus and trying to do 'what the scientists tell him' in a self-sacrificial manner. Better still we can substitute 'The NHS' as the God, with personifications such as Tom Moore and those brave masked nurses you see on TV being living representations of the greater thing. It's a theme common in many world religions such as the many faces of God in hinduism or the various gurus of Sikhism.</p>
<p>2 - A process of indoctrination or coercive education often referred to as 'Brainwashing' (no further f*cking explanation needed there).</p>
<p>3 - Exploitation of the group by the leader and ruling coterie. We're literally laying down lives in order to 'save the NHS', it's an official slogan and comes before the safety or wellbeing of the individual. The NHS has stopped being there to serve the people, but the people now exist to serve the benevolent God that is the NHS.</p>
<p><strong>The bullet points at the bottom of the article regarding secondary characteristics of a cult all fit the description of the NHS in the context of 2021. To any Americans reading, this is an organization for which people literally stand outside of their front doors clapping when the government instructs them to. Britain is now a public healthcare cult with a state hanging off it. The justification for all actions in the political realm are now given in the context of furthering the interests of the NHS above all else. Unless you've lived here you won't understand how culturally pervasive it is in day-to-day life. People see the state as a part of their family.</strong></p>
