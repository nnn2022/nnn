    <strong>Possible vaccine shedding affects? (Warning, contains talk of periods)</strong>
    <p><p>I returned to the workforce in mid-April (I had to) and everyone here has either been vaccinated before I came or recently. </p>
<p>I suffer from migraines but prior to my return to work, it was only approximately one or two per month. Since I’ve returned I’ve had 5 in the last 6 weeks. This is not normal for me.</p>
<p>Also, I’m noticing premenstrual syndrome is BAD. High anxiety, wicked mood swings. Today all I feel like doing is bawling. </p>
<p>The only things that have changed is I’m forced to wear a mask more often (it is not optional if I want to work) and I’m around vaccinated people daily.</p>
<p>Anyone else experience anything similar?</p></p>

        <p>From what I know I would first think that the mask wearing is what has caused the increase in migraines. Perhaps any added stress as well. </p>
<p>Vaccine shedding is a thing, but what I have heard are these two things:</p>
<p>(1) They don’t have enough data to know if COVID vaccines are shedding.</p>
<p>(2) If it is shedding, it shouldn’t be enough to have any bad side effects. But who knows.</p>

        <p>I am thinking the masks are contributing to the migraines too. I’m really, really frustrated with it.</p>

        <p>I think so too. I think it's fair to say breathing in our own carbon dioxide and/or a lack of oxygen using a mask during work or other activities will contribute to stress, headaches, and light headedness, as well as there could be trapped microbes in the inner layer of the mask, so that's why I hate wearing mine whenever I have work related duties requiring me to wear one or for shopping.</p>

        <p>Are they requiring a certain kind of mask? When I wore one, I just used a bandana and nobody said boo to me. If they had, I’d have reminded them it works as good as theirs. That doesn’t address the period issues, but at least might help with the migraine- at least you can breathe.</p>

        <p>They want at least a normal cloth one. They wouldn’t accept a bandanna.</p>
<p>Apparently in my province it’s anticipated mask mandates will end by mid July. If they don’t, I’ll be looking for a WFH job.</p>

        <p>Yes!! I’ve had 2 1/2 periods in one month so far, it’s been less than a week since my last one and I’m hoping that it will be at least a month before I have it again! I can’t avoid the injected people unfortunately. I did hear that nettle tea is supposed to help detox, and taking baths with alfalfa as well. I don’t know if these things work or not, but I figure it’s worth the try!</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and my PMS has been horrible! I am on birth control and I usually don’t get my period for 3 to 5 months. I’ve never in my life had PMS so bad.</p>

        <p>I put together this helpful post a few days ago. In essence, there is A LOT of anecdotal evidence that vaxxed people are breathing out via water vapour or passing on through touch via sweat glands something foreign to non-vaxxed people. MSM experts and scientists will say that protein shedding from these vaccines is very little to non-existent, while scientists who I follow (and have had their YouTube, Twitter or Facebook pages banned) have said viral shedding is a real thing, and that we should be avoiding vaxxed people for about a month (or more). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There's some good info about viral protein shedding in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nmfvpe/i_think_the_shot_causes_people_to_shed_something/"><strong>this post</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And some news came out about how <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/noej8n/leaked_pfizer_study_from_the_european_medicines/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>the Pfizer vaccine particles are gathering in women's ovaries</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan's video about <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/self-spreading-vaccines-self-amplifying-mrna-vaccines-covid-vaccine-menstrual-disruption/"><strong>Self-Spreading Vaccines, Self-Amplifying MRNA Vaccines &amp; COVID Vaccine Menstrual Disruption</strong></a> was one of his best works (and he always cites his sources near the bottom of the page). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/"><strong>here's a good article about how covid vaccines are shedding</strong></a> that talks about shedding. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, listen to what former Pfizer scientist Michael Yeadon had to say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nlphfh/michael_yeadon_full_interview/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>about this scamdemic</strong></a>. Or you can just check <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nl72px/chief_scientist_of_pfizer_mike_yeadon_it_is_now/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>this out</strong></a> to read.</p>
