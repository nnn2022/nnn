    <strong>Went at it with vaxxer today, for sport</strong>
    <p><p>The amount of times he said “scientifically proven” blew my mind.</p>
<p>They firmly believe that any future wave will be entirely caused by “the unvaccinated”.</p>
<p>And they see no connection whatsoever to WW2.</p>
<p>I think we need to organize and agree on a single assumption. And that is “I’m not taking it”.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter at this point what’s real, what’s in the injection, or what happens to those who take it These are tangential to the point.</p>
<p>They hate us regardless of our reason for not wanting it. We are 100% in the crosshairs of a massive amount of people who essentially want us removed from society at best, and dead at worst.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw a video of some kids egging an “anti masker”. It had 12k up votes.</p></p>

        <p>I've decided that when someone calls me an anti-vaxxer for not getting the shot, I'm going to ask them if they get the flu shot. If they answer no, then I'm going to tell them they must be an anti vaxxer as well.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t an anti-vaxxer, but i am strongly against THIS vaccine. If that now means im an anti vaxxer, fuck it then, im a proud anti vaxxer. I dont give a shit what these people think. We are well past the point of injury and death in the context of historical precedence to stop vaccine distribution. To continue this is madness.</p>

        <p>Won't work.</p>
<p>The response system being used in arguing with people in this event is "do anything to win, even cheat" so they will just answer with whatever it takes to make you 'wrong' for being <em>even remotely capable</em> of formulating an heretical opinion. It is an incredibly well thought out, clumsily implemented, Kafka trap that only has one acceptable answer/action combo. Unfortunately, you have already lost the game and are already socially 'impure' due to the unsuccessful (or lack of an) attempt to divine the 'correct' answer miraculously before the question is even asked.  </p>
<p>&rt;"Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past."</p>
<p>-Sartre</p>
<p>Untraceable rumors against anyone who was not already on board with the program were probably stirring around and taking shape amidst social circles long beforehand.</p>
<p>You either take the "<em>Pledge"</em> (Sartre) or <em>the irrevocable symbolic gesture, the public agreement to be a vulnerable (and hence trustworthy) member of society</em> or else you become "<em>Homo Sacer"</em> or <em>the sacred/accursed man</em> (Agamben), one whom cannot be <em>ritualistically</em> sacrificed (tried and convicted) but can be killed by anybody without consequence. Considering some of the freakout videos that I've watched, the preliminary psychology for <em>that</em> process has been laid out in some form or fashion. Not sure how to reverse that without some widespread institutional help.</p>
<p>I don't know "The Truth" or anything - I'm just concerned that I cannot just dismiss this all out of hand. I would very much like this not to illicit my wondering: A) whether Nuremberg Codes actually hold up or mean anything; B) if we'll need a Nuremberg 2; or, C) whether A or B will even be recognizable concepts in the near future. </p>
<p>It is dismaying to me that I cannot seem to find a single person on "That Side" who doesn't either laugh at me for asking or get uncomfortably upset or impositional/confrontational or outright manipulative with me for bringing it up at all. There's not even a good-faith "let's unpack that" friendly discussion. Just a lot of "you've stepped over the line" looks and dismissal. No middle ground/compromise. <em>"You're going to get someone killed!"</em></p>
<p>In any case, it appears that the vaccine could be interpreted, in some warped way, as a timed window of opportunity for a fully orchestrated event to be played out in real time, that is designed to provide the situational platform for, and to educe in certain individuals, the performance of 'acts of faith' in solidarity with the institutions and social environments that are charged with the health, well-being and general maintenance of the population. Even if 'holding out' is a possibility, armed with impenetrable reasoning and damning evidence of foul play or the potential dangers of fulfilling their requests, I'm not sure that the positive consequences of taking this position are explicit enough at this point to guarantee any sigh of relief in the near future. That is my only way so far to steel-man their position for them, however untrue or vague or unhelpful it might be.</p>
<p>Sorry to rant. I hope I'm wrong about basically all of this, but that won't return to me my time, lost and broken relationships or missed opportunities from it all either way. That particular 'knife' is 'still in' so to speak, so I feel compelled to rant about it, apparently.</p>

        <p>Even the "my body my choice" reason is not good enough. I've been told that's not a <em>real</em> reason, and that's when I realized I was talking with someone who would probably gladly see a shackle and chain locked on my neck, physically.</p>

<p>First, what does that say about your vaccine?</p>
<p>Second, unvaccinated doesn't automatically mean infected.  How is an unvaccinated person who doesn't have the virus going to pass it on to a vaccinated person?</p>

        <p>There's only one proven way to deal with vaxtards and it works like this:</p>
<p><em>"When are you getting your vaccine?"</em></p>
<p><em>"The Trump vaccine? Oh I'll never take that, I hate Trump and want nothing to do with him. You're not a Trump supporter, are you? He's pushing people to take it, calls himself, 'the father of the vaccine'."</em></p>
<p>It's really that easy, try it and see. If they try to weasel away, bring it back to Trump, Operation Warp Speed, and that kind of thing.</p>
