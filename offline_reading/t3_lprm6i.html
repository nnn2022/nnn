    <strong>Can we please have a calm and respectful discussion?</strong>
    <p><p>Anyways, i just wanna ask, why? Why do believe vaccines are bad? We've explained how MRna vax works so i'd assume you'd understand by now? It is not the mark of the beast. The mark will be, well....... a mark. And it says it'll be on the right *hand* (not arm) or the forehead. I don't see anyone's forehead or right hand being vaccinated. There isn't a microchip in there, the needle is too thin.</p>
<p>Another question. What's the governments motive? They have no motive to fake covid. "It's for control" But the government already has a lot of control. I mean new zealand got out of covid within months because they listened to restrictions. theyre practically covid free now. You complain about your kids being sad or angry, but maybe if you had listened to the first restrictions, you and you're kids  wouldn't need a vax. "The vaccine was developed too fast, that's shady" No, its been worked on for a long time. Covid has existed before 2019, but the covid 19 strain was the pandemic one. Since covid has existed for a while, they've been making a vax. But they're just finishing up using earlier research.</p>
<p>Last question (I think). Where are you're sources? Where did you hear 99% survival rate? I think someone on social media said it once and the NNN'ers have been using it a lot without fact checking. "It's just the flu" no it isn't. Thats like saying cancer is just a shaved head (Yes its an extreme example but has the same logic). Yes the flu and covid share symptoms, that doesn't make it the same. "But I've had covid and it was painless" Well you were lucky. Covid symptoms can be severe but sometimes in your case, asymptomatic.</p>
<p>(Not a question, just wanted to say) Why do you say "The bible says this, the constitution said that" Exactly where does it say? Maybe if you actually picked up the bible for the first time in years instead of making fake quotes, you could see where you're wrong. Where does it say in the constitution "Thou can wear what you want, and get the vax if you want" No Where. It doesn't say that. "You can't make me where a mask" Actually, yes they can. You're on private property and must abide by there rules. If you're in your car/ house or are outside, no one can force you, it's your opinion. What if you said "no shoes on the carpet" And then people came in with muddy shoes and ruined your carpet? You'd be mad. The mask rule is the same principle as "no shirt no shoes no service". Its also like school uniform. What would you do if your kid told the office people "You can't make me wear uniform, I'm no sheep". You'd probably be mad too. I do feel bad for this next generation because a lot of parents will teach them to be anti everything. You are influencing your kids, but in a bad way. </p>
<p>Please keep the replies respectful, mature, and kind</p>
<p>-----Sincerely,</p>
<p>A 14 yr old boy in Texas, USA</p></p>

        <p>It'd be real nice if the subversives were coming in with good faith. But I'm personally sick of being called every word in the dictionary of douchebaggery since 2015. So those who enter in poor faith get the lip.</p>
<p>We're not "anti-science." Your vax is not even effective.</p>
<p>We're not "denying" covid. We recognize that it's overblown by those who are motivated by the results of the lies.</p>

        <p>You have a lot of questions, that's good, but we've been having this discussion for a year now, and I have no intention of attempting to share with you everything I have read and learned in that time, nor the personal experience and study that lead to the ability to understand all of it.</p>
<p>Go out and actually read the studies that discuss mask efficacy, lockdown efficacy, covid survival rates, and try and learn a bit of stats so you can understand why your NZ anecdote isn't particularly relevant to the control of a respiratory virus in places like the US and EU where it circulated for MONTHS prior to notice.</p>
<p>All these studies are available, many from CDC/WHO themselves showing just how mild covid is (at your age, it's something like 2 deaths in 100,000 cases, and those are all in severely compromised patients).  There are also hundreds of studies discussing the horrible impacts of lockdowns and associated restrictions.</p>
<p>You're young, you sound curious, I advise you to go read as much as you can on this, with an open mind, not assuming that any particular side is correct just because they're loud, numerous, or on tv.</p>
<p>Then come back with specific, detailed questions, and many here will be willing to talk with you.  You just need to show some effort on your own.</p>

        <p>I wish you luck.  It's just a big ask with which to start a conversation:  "I'm new here, why do you guys actually believe everything you do?"  I've read dozens if not hundreds of studies on this in the last year, and have a live-in bio phd that can answer many of my questions.  We together have a couple decades of ems experience and medic/nurse/md contacts accrued in that time.  I work in stats and machine learning as my job.  So I believe what I believe based on this breadth of experience and knowledge, and it's hard to share that in a reddit post.  </p>
<p>There are people here with collections of links (try searching copypasta?) and a lot of youtube videos (ivor cummins has some good ones, also anything with Dr (MD/PhD) Jay Battacharya) and a few research sites that are working on bringing data and studies together ( https://swprs.org/ ).  But it just takes a lot of time to work through them, see which are of high quality, unbiased, aggregate the information to a reasonable picture.</p>
<p>The question of "why?" is still outstanding.  There are simple theories, that big companies like amazon are each making BILLIONS from this, pharma companies stand to make even more.  There are wilder theories like the great reset, which are terrifying.  What does someone like Cuomo gain by sending poverty and race/gender relations all back decades?  It really isn't clear.  (Newsome is making bank in california from big company contributions, maybe it's all just money?)  I wish we knew, I'm worried we'll find out soon.</p>

        <p>No offense..but you're 14 so yeah you aren't as apprised on the situation nor effected by the lock downs as badly as adults.</p>
<p>Most people here are not denying that covid exists. We are just calling out that the virus is nowhere near as deadly as the media and government are making it out to be.</p>
<p>The virus is mostly killing the elderly over 75, the obese, people with compromised immune systems and those with prior health conditions. So more or less it's killing the same camps of people as any other novel virus. </p>
<p>This virus is not deadly enough to warrant any of these lock downs or restrictions and certainly not worth crippling our economy over.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>People are apprehensive of the vaccines because they were rushed. The reported side effects are often worse than the illness the vaccine is meant to treat. I'd personally rather get covid and get over it than risk getting temporary bells palsy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Mandates are not laws so no they can't force me to wear a mask.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you wanna wear a  mask and stay home over a novel virus go ahead. I'm going to continue to not wear a mask and live my life as normally as i can despite the efforts of the government to stop me from doing so.</p>

        <p>My age has quite literally, no effect on my understanding of covid. Your age doesn't make you smarter wiser or better. "Not as effected as adults". Dude what. my age group is way more effected, i mean these are my social years that decide what i grow into. You already lived a lot of your life, the only thing its affected is shopping and your workplace. Meanwhile i have to deal with virtual school and not being around friends, so i could make the argument that its affected me worse</p>

        <p>Yeah it kinda does sorry. At your age you are very impressionable. You guys are being denied school whilst very awful and should not have ever happened you aren't at risk of suddenly losing your job cause the government suddenly decides your place of business is not "essential".</p>
<p>You will ultimately end up back in school whilst many adults will not be going back to their jobs since many of these places will be shuttered.</p>

        <p>I am so grateful to have grown up in a world in which we were smart enough to know we were kids who should assume the older people know much that we do not.</p>
<p>If you already know everything at 14 it’s time to get going. Emancipate and go start a business or something. Get yourself a Ferrari. The world is at your fingertips.</p>

        <p>Dude you grew up in the 50s when women and blacks couldn't vote. The "elders are always right" is the most stupid and outdated phrase i've ever heard. I didn't say i know everything you dunce, i just said that being older doesn't make you right. Hitler is older than me, yet i know he was wrong. so please shut up. Im grateful to have grown up in a world where racism wasnt as relevant as it was then. I'm sorry but your comment glows with stupidity</p>

        <p>&rt;My age has quite literally, no effect on my understanding</p>
<p>Yes. Yes it does. I am 26. The last 6 years of my life I have learned more, and understood more than all my 20 years prior. In the last year alone I have gained an immense understanding. </p>
<p>And I don't know shit. The more I learn, the more I realize how much more there is to learn. This is called the Dunnin-Kruger effect. Its a fun read.</p>
<p>Over coming this comes from living. From experiencing. From seeing. You may be smart, you may be the smartest person in the world, you may understand how things work individually, but until you start piecing all those bits together, diving into the depths, and seeing how things really are, asking tough and critical questions, questions people don't like being asked, until you really start living and digging into things, you don't know a damn thing.</p>
<p>Keep asking questions, keep being curious. NEVER assume you are correct, or that anything is settled. </p>
<p>"1500 years ago, everybody 'knew' that the earth was the center of the universe. 500 years ago, everybody 'knew' that the earth was flat. And 15 minutes ago, you 'knew' that humans were alone on this planet. Imagine what you'll 'know' tomorrow."</p>

        <p>Why don't you spend some time reading through posts to get a better understanding of our opinions and why we so strongly feel the way we feel. You are growing up learning that everyone is to be feared, that they might be carrying an invisible virus around with them so you aren't able to see their faces or properly socialize which is important at your age. You are being taught to fear everything and everyone. you can't compare covid to cancer. In fact, people are missing out on vital treatments because covid has been prioritized. Your risk is incredibly minimal. You have a greater risk of contracting a thousand other things. I advise you to think for yourself and see out different opinions than the ones you've been told. There are a number of studies out there on the issues with mRNA vaccines, which are largely untested on humans and have been rushed out and caused a decent amount of harm already.</p>

        <p>Yeah I've been reading NNN posts for about a month, but they're mostly just memes and calling us sheep. Also yes its invisible, so is air. Does that make air fake? mRNA is relatively new, so of course there are some problems. It has to start somewhere, its not like we've had it for years</p>

        <p>Regarding the vaccine, I was never an "anti-vaxxer" before. I dont think I am now.  I am suspicious of the overreaction and the over-reach involved in this pandemic response. There has been a disregard for best practices in almost every sphere civilized society like public policy, respect for human rights, science, free exchange of ideas, delivery of medical care, responsible news reporting etc. </p>
<p>For example:
Masks are mandated despite a lack of evidence for their efficacy. </p>
<p>Governments are illegally detaining and isolating innocent and uninfected people in the absence of a clinical diagnosis of covid-19.</p>
<p>There has been obvious sensationalism in the news media.</p>
<p>There has been obvious stifling of counter-narrative points of view from scientific experts.</p>
<p>It makes zero sense to pressure people who are not at a high risk of complications to inject a foreign substance that is supposed to reduce their risk of complications. "My body; my choice" has been rescinded apparently. </p>
<p>Reason has completely gone out the window and replaced by hysteria and agenda. So based on all the screw-ups/cover-ups that I do know about, I am highly skeptical of injecting anything into my body in the current environment.</p>

        <p>The CDC itself has stated that the vaccine will not end transmission of the virus. And will not protect you from getting the virus. The vaccine will only lessen the symptoms and make them more manageable for the person receiving it. So yes it is “my body my choice” me not taking the vaccine will not save anyone, even myself from getting the virus.</p>

        <p>Those aren't insults, those are observations. Everyone has biases and incorrect beliefs, including myself.</p>
<p>You are coming into this forum late, after most people here have been insulted for a year and have lost their livelihoods and been locked up against their will for a reason they adamantly disagree with. I would ask you to try and understand that perspective and try not to take all this to heart. My guess is if you were in the same situation you would act similarly as we are all human.</p>
<p>As a principle I believe safety is not more important than individual liberty and quarantine is for the sick, not the healthy.</p>
<p>Those beliefs, applied to most of your questions should provide an answer. It is likely we just disagree on my principles.</p>
