    <strong>Hypocrisy in "COVID Conscious" People</strong>
    <p><p>Okay folks. Second post of the day. But I just have so many thoughts about all of this.</p>
<p>Anyways, have you guys noticed an <em>exceeding</em> amount of hypocrisy amongst COVID doomers? In particular, I mean comparing their previous lives and now. Some examples I see are:</p>
<p>1) Government/experts has told the population for years, obesity is an epidemic, people need to have healthy habits, blah blah blah. Yet, my obese friends and family members all of sudden now get to decide their cOmProMiSeD??? Like dude, a) why didn't you listen to the government then when they told you to lose weight and b) that's your own fault.</p>
<p>2) People who smoke weed. Now, I could care less if you smoke weed or not. Not my business. What I do get annoyed at however is that some of the most COVID conscious people I know used to share bowls with countless strangers and not give a second thought. But now that the government tells you to wash your hands and "diSeaSe!!!!", its time to listen. </p>
<p>3) General personal hygiene. Okay, so I worked at this place for a few years (a small business in my city) that rented gear out to people. These long standing employees, I kid you not, were the most unhygienic people I had ever met back in 2016. They would literally keep food and utensils in the customer bathroom, eat off of the counter where the customers checked out, share drinks, share bites of food, never cleaned the darned store, and never ever cleaned the gear customers rented. I think you get the picture. I thought it was gross back then. But now, they are all "COVID!!!!!" And get offended when a customer "doesn't ask if an item has been quarantined" - you read that right, THE EMPLOYEES get triggered when a customer presumedly "doesn't care about the pAnDeMiC" because they didn't ask of their own accord if some random item in the store has been quarantined. Literally, these employees <em>refuse</em> to eat at work they're so terrified the COVID is gonna get them taking a bite of a sandwich. </p>
<p>Does anyone have any other examples of hypocrisy amongst the doomers?</p></p>

        <p>Yes I see this. In germany we had police officers drink out of the same bottle, and at the same time they were beating up anti maskers. </p>
<p>But what I have seen also is that if you discuss the facts with covid extremists (it is what it is) and you stay calm they run out of arguments very very fast. Its comical, really. They then start to insult you and try to make you look like you are a right wing extremist or conspiracy theorist. They always try to avoid discussing real facts. For example if you tell them that mortality has not increased this year they just switch the topics. If no more people are dying than in the previous years HOW CAN WE HAVE A DEADLY PANDEMIC. It doesnt make sense and it should be clear for everyone who looks at the numbers</p>

        <p>The biggest hypocrisy is the fact that they only support "my body my choice" when it benefits them. But when the government says wear a mask or go to jail they happily comply because of how brainwashed they are</p>

        <p>They have no actual real thoughts of their own. It’s just whatever is told to them. They would just as easily forget about covid and be into being afraid of the next thing tomorrow and will literally justify it to you like they know what they are talking about. </p>

        <p>Man they are very flighty I have learned. We have real constitutional deep human universal truths and values we are holding onto. They have a few articles with tons of lies and hypocrisies to rely on. </p>
<p>We shouldn’t be scared of these people. The most they can do is shame you, other than that there is nothing. I learned many actual debates with these people end with “it’s not even that serious”  with this whole demeanor as it’s all a joke and a game and none of it is THAT serious. </p>
<p>Most of these people are sitting on a high horse thinking life is still sunshine and rainbows. They aren’t serious about anything or actually really informed. No real ambitions or interests other than sitting around.</p>

        <p>I know of someone on another site I frequent who is a loud proponent of further lockdowns, while at the same time has a plea on her profile page to contribute to her good friend's Go Fund Me page, because her friend has been struggling so hard during the pandemic--with depression, job loss, financial problems.</p>

        <p>Many people I know, specially in France like my girlfriend family I try to reason with, I give real numbers, faulty tests, empty hospitals and all the obvious bullshit regarding this scam.</p>
<p>Then the gf of my girlfriend brother speaks all smart cause she study medicine and defend covid to death, and specially she say that right now is very important to do a lockdown like if she is actually studing the case, however 4 weeks ago when there was no lockdown she was in the bar and meeting with friends and having drinks and so does all my gf family, however now that the TV say you should stay home she defend that idea as if she is really informed. Also she prays that the government allow her to celebrate Christmas and she said that even if is not allowed she will break the rule for Christmas.</p>

        <p>Yes absolutely. Several of my most doomer friends viritue signal LIKE CRAZY online, but still live their lives mostly normally.   </p>
<p>One guy came to my halloween party (about a dozen guests), then posted online the next day complaining about people not wearing masks OUTDOORS while in line to vote  </p>
<p>Another friend yelled at her own grandmother, because the grandmother had a guest over. The same friend allowed her mother and grandmother to bring her groceries and tp at home.  </p>
<p>I actually think this partial compliance is the most dangerous stance. These are people who pay lip service to lockdowns, but have the resources/safety net/privilege to not be materially impacted by them in the day to day  </p>
<p>Lockdown rules are predicated on the idea that people have the financial means to weather them, when most of us don't. Up until this month there's been absolutely no discussion of it in the mainstream. It's a huge blindspot, and any attempt to bring it up gets you lumped in with conspiracy theorists and trumpers</p>

        <p>That isn't hypocritical. It's people starting to take things like their weight, germs, and hygiene more seriously because they have been faced with a serious reason to do so. That's personal growth, motivated by a fear of  imminent death.</p>
