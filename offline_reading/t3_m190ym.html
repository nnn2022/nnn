        <p>Don't pay anything. </p>
<p>The Canadian Government are knowingly harrassing and arresting and violating Canadian Constitutional rights and their human rights. They are handing out illegal fines and they know it. They are delaying trials and due process in an attempt to frighten Canadians in to complying with illegal orders.</p>
<p>You will see crooked courts delaying the trials and postponing bail on innocent people.</p>
<p>These Courts will delay as long as they can before they toss these baseless charges out. The Courts are trying to prevent any Judgements that Politicians have to abide by. They are working in tandem with the Politicians. </p>
<p>Canada is a Banana Republic and Is no longer a lawful Country. </p>
<p>Everything Canada is doing is contrary to Canada's Charter of Permissions and Privileges.</p>

<p>The Numbers</p>
<p>&rt;Only 990 of the 5,584 charges laid since March 2020 had been dealt with — fines being paid, the charges withdrawn or another disposition — as of January 2021, according to data provided by the Ministry of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>&rt;As of January, a total $469,839 in fines had been paid across the province, including $27,620 from Toronto.</p>
<p>&rt;Of the charges that had been dealt with, most were prepaid set fines that never went to trial and were not disputed. A small number of charges were withdrawn before trial. Most of the charges were laid under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.</p>
<p>&rt;Few actual trials, either because of the offence or because a charge is disputed, appear to have taken place.</p>
