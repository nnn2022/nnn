    <strong>Florida Statute allowing for forced vaccinations</strong>
    <p><p>Florida Statute 381.00315 states the following:</p>
<p>“4. Ordering an individual to be examined, tested, vaccinated, treated, isolated, or quarantined for communicable diseases that have significant morbidity or mortality and present a severe danger to public health. Individuals who are unable or unwilling to be examined, tested, vaccinated, or treated for reasons of health, religion, or conscience may be subjected to isolation or quarantine.
a. Examination, testing, vaccination, or treatment may be performed by any qualified person authorized by the State Health Officer.
b. If the individual poses a danger to the public health, the State Health Officer may subject the individual to isolation or quarantine. If there is no practical method to isolate or quarantine the individual, the State Health Officer may use any means necessary to vaccinate or treat the individual.”</p>
<p>Section B says that if the State Health Officer decides quarantines are not “practical” then they can “use any means necessary to vaccinate” the individual. This overrides all religious or medical exemptions as well.</p>
<p>I did not know about this but this is terrifying. I have no doubt they will use this once the vaccine comes out to forcibly administer it. </p>
<p>What’s more concerning is that every person I tell this to they argue that it is good and people should be forced to take the vaccine. I don’t understand how people can think like this. Is America too far gone and brainwashed at this point?</p></p>

        <p>No.  Don't give up hope based on speculation.  There's a significant amount of the populous that will refuse to take it and there's nothing they're going to be able to do about it.</p>

        <p>They can implement whatever they want, but it can't be enforced at the individual level.  Imagine how much airline business would suffer?  Airlines would be pissed.  Every action a business takes is about money.  If we are of a significant enough majority, they'll have no choice but to allow us to travel, if they want that money.  So don't give up hope and don't think there's overwhelming majority that wants the vaccine, because there's not.</p>

<p>Except we don't seem to be a signficant majority. Most people have been apathetic or supportive of the lockdowns and mandates, for instance. Most people also seem to be okay with the vaccines, and taking them. If that comes to pass, businesses won't care, and will mandate health passports for entry and consumption of goods and services. I think even places like Walmart will mandate healthpassports for entry. I can even see many small businesses going along with this, or being forced into it by local or other governments.</p>

        <p>There's no way in hell Wal-Mart could enforce that.  It's not even feasible.  Think about it - right now they aren't able to enforce facial coverings, customers just blow right by their Mask police they have at the entrances and they can't do shit.  The only place I see it being feasible is the airport, because people are used to having their liberties abused by TSA, but even that won't last.</p>

        <p>Every Walmart (along with basically every other business) I've been to has been enforcing the mask mandates. If you try to blow right by them, they have their security guards or cops come to escort you out. I've not seen a single person actually get away with shopping maskless in my state.</p>

        <p>It's funny how people in this sub will denounce polls as fake or manipulative when it says people are in support of lockdowns, masks, vaccines, etc. But when a poll shows something they want to hear, then polls are accurate and true always...but only if they are anti-lockdowns/masks/vaccines!</p>

        <p>Polls are not completely accurate. The last election showed that very well. But that doesn't mean they are completely fabricated. It requires some nuance to understand them well. </p>
<p>If a poll on public opinion shows that 50% of people don't want that vaccine, that's significant even if it is really 55% or 45%.</p>

        <p>So if another poll states 65% of participants want the vaccine then what? </p>
<p>What about the various polls that claim that the majority support lockdowns, masks, etc? Most people on here denounce those as fake right away, yet polls that claim the opposite are held up as truth even though, according to these same people, polls are always misleading, fake, and so on.</p>

        <p>Well, people on here are individuals with different perspectives. I don't think the polls are all fake. I do think they can be misleading. </p>
<p>I think most people do support the lockdowns. That doesn't make them right. Nor does that give them the right to force the lockdown policies on others.</p>
<p>Also, if 65% support vaccinations, that still leaves 35% that don't. That is a very substantial portion of the total population. About 1 in every 3 people. I would still consider that a good thing. </p>
<p>Polls are not perfect but it is clear that we are very far from unanimous support for vaccinations. Hence, the media is working overtime to make anyone who refuses a conspiracy nutjob or some immoral sociopath. Neither are true. These people are simply not convinced the vaccine is worth the potential risk.</p>

        <p>Don't panic. Florida is still awesome! The title of this post is somewhat misleading. Forced vaccines COULD happen, but it's doubtful.</p>
<p>If you read the whole statute:</p>
<p>First - this would only apply if the state has been declared to be under a public health emergency. I believe we had been in a state of emergency earlier in the year, but that declaration expired at the beginning of November, so that would make all of these rules irrelevant.</p>
<p>Second - it talks about "Ordering an individual to be examined, tested, vaccinated, treated, isolated, or quarantined for communicable diseases that have significant morbidity or mortality and present a severe danger to public health."  The words "significant" and "severe" are open to interpretation. Could covid fall in this category? Perhaps, but see my first point.</p>
<p>Third - it states, " Individuals who are unable or unwilling to be examined, tested, vaccinated, or treated for reasons of health, religion, or conscience may be subjected to isolation or quarantine." Then it goes on to say,  "If there is no practical method to isolate or quarantine the individual, the State Health Officer may use any means necessary to vaccinate or treat the individual. " We've all been isolating and quarantine-ing, so I don't think they could justify this rule either since there are clearly practical ways to isolate and quarantine.</p>
<p>Finally - DeSantis has said he will not force vaccines. I believe he will keep his word.</p>

        <p>This could explain DeSantis' outspoken anti-lockdown/mandatory vaccine attitude. He gets to look like a hero to conservatives by saying he is against these mandatory measures, but he has this statute in his back pocket in order for his cronies to enforce the upcoming vaccines, and continue rolling out the agenda. </p>
<p>I know people regard this guy as a hero, but I do not trust him. If he was so "data driven" then he wouldn't have locked Florida down to begin with months ago, because there was already data coming out indicating the virus wasn't dangerous. Unlike Noem, he didn't stick to his guns, and allowed the lockdown of Florida. So either he really did mess up and regrets his actions, or he is actually controlled opposition.</p>
<p>I could be wrong. Maybe he really doesn't know, but people really should question the motives of these politicians, and stuff like this should give you pause.</p>

        <p>Yes, it would, because everyone and their mother is convinced it has significant mortality, and is a present severe danger to public health. It doesn't <em>need</em> to be, they just have to <em>convince</em> a large part of the populace of that.</p>

        <p>+1. an IFR of only 0.1% to 0.5% was "significant mortality" enough to destroy small business and force wearing of dust masks. just wait till they release the ebola virus with 50% IFR</p>
