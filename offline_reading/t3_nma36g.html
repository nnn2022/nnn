    <strong>Are we predestined to repeat history?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been reading more about collapsology lately &amp; these emerging patterns are pretty interesting. The events and timelines vary, but the end result is always the same. </p>
<p><em>A society forms either from chaos or from nothing</em>. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/science/aboriginal-australians-dna-origins-australia.amp.html">Aboriginal people</a> </p>
<p><em>Aforementioned society establishes its government</em>. <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/creating-the-united-states/founded-on-a-set-of-beliefs.html">USA</a></p>
<p><em>People within society either under assess their available resources</em> (over hunt, under farm, etc) <em>and die</em> (famine, disease) <em>or they are not suited for the conditions of the environment and die</em> (climate change, natural disasters) <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-did-the-mayan-civilization-collapse-a-new-study-points-to-deforestation-and-climate-change-30863026/">Mayans</a> </p>
<p><em>Any surviving societies at this stage believe they should go to war with others to acquire more land and resources or go to war with themselves (depopulation, social division)</em> <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.livescience.com/amp/why-did-rome-fall.html">Rome</a> </p>
<p>This unfortunate schedule has been true of virtually EVERY fallen society in Earth's history. </p>
<p>We have free will and yet we keep making the same mistakes.</p>
<p>How can we be different?</p></p>

        <p>If I may ask, what’s your opinion of very secretive societies (or entities) who have been controlling mankind’s path for quite some time now? For example, the Native American Indians were well into the millions, but were reduced to almost nothing no thanks to the destructive nature of the European colonists. Had they been left to their own, perhaps they could have reached a very high spiritual level, without the need for technology or today’s comforts. I still feel the reason why all empires/kingdoms fail is due to not being in tune with Mother Nature. Yes, diseases exist, but living off the land does increase our immune systems. I’ve read some medical studies about Amish, Mennonites and farmers where their immune systems are off the charts; no allergies, just muscle pain from farm work.</p>
