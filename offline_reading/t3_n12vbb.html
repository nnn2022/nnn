        <p>The fact that China gets a pass on having concentration camps and suppressing the populations calls for freedom is so sickening. They won’t recognize Taiwan and basically ended the Hong Kong protests by this virus getting out. When I hear US politicians talk about China in nice terms, it makes my skin crawl. The CCP is vile and should be treated as such.</p>

        <p>Not just China, but almost all the Asian nations applauded for their reaction to COVID! Maybe they aren't so bad as China or North Korea, but Singapore and South Korea have been on that path for awhile. The only places that "got COVID under control" are places where the citizens are already under exceptionally firm control. Places where "at least the streets are clean!" justifies the harsh cleansing of those streets by coercion and force. To which our naysayers say "so?"</p>

        <p>I have seen nothing about the population calling for freedom. Do you have any reliable sources for this? I’m pretty sure the reason that China is getting a pass, as you say, is because there is no concrete proof. Just generic pictures and unverifiable statements.</p>

<p>No I don’t watch NBA.</p>

<p>No and I don’t know why in the world they would be asking American Basketball players about another countries politics. It sounds ridiculous.</p>

<p>Well ya I am sure if you look it up I’m sure it would be easy to find but you are acting like this is stuff everyone knows about. It’s not. There are lots of people who don’t even use the internet on a regular basis. Stop assuming people have seen every article you read on Twitter. Most people don’t have a Twitter.</p>

<p>Right! I would definitely like to learn more about this but I can’t find any proof from reliable sources. Just BBC shit.</p>

<p>“The CCP is a corrupt government power bent on accumulating power through any means necessary.”</p>
<p>Again I would really like to see some evidence of this. Especially the by any means necessary part. </p>
<p>If this is true than it would 100% concern me, but I am tired of being yanked around by media, and I honestly thought that all of us here were on the same page on that. Instead I am seeing that you guys trust MSM as long as it doesn’t involve anything related to the Carona Virus. You really think that is the only thing they lie about?!?</p>

        <p>I don't speak.for everyone here, but the media has little to do with my feelings on China. I don't trust China because history has shown that government/corporate atrocity increases with population density. To that end, most Western nations are also on that same path and it hasn't much to do with those icky Commies corrupting us. Just the social cycle at work.</p>

        <p>Hitler asked who remembers the Armenian genocide as he was getting ready to commit his genocide. </p>
<p>I have issued the command -- and I'll have anybody who utters but one word of criticism executed by a firing squad -- that our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formations in readiness -- for the present only in the East -- with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space (Lebensraum) which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?</p>
<p>Kevork B. Bardakjian, Hitler and the Armenian Genocide (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Zoryan Institute, 1985).</p>
<p>The acts of ethnic cleansing and attempted genocide have not stopped.</p>
<p>We used to ask how the germans could have let the holocaust happen. Now I'm seeing german cops applauded for assaulting a bare face.</p>

        <p>Yeah, no.. It's exactly like you say it in Germany as u describe it, just the total opposite. 
Police don't get applauded for that since they dont "assault" them, heck they have the right to protest under the regulation to wear a mask. Guess what? They never adhere to any regulations while protesting and all the police is doing is to hug the illegal protestors, give thumb ups and wink to them. 
But if you're from the counter protest you get slapped to the ground or wall that the wall breaks. But yeah.. You guys are the oppresed people who get "assaulted" and everything is worse than a torturous genocide because of wearing a fucking mask.</p>
<p>Further.. you say the ethic cleansing never stopped, so which etnicity is it who get cleansed nowadays?</p>

        <p>There's a long process that leads to atrocities. It took almost 10 years in nazi Germany. It always starts with seperating and demonizing 'the other people' as one of the first steps. Will the the western world go all the way again this time? Nobody knows, but we are definitely seeing the first steps again.</p>

        <p>Yeah.. right.. im with you!<br>
Wanna go protest that murdering should be legal? C'mon it ill be fun, for one of us at least. ;)<br>
I mean seriously, i can understand that if you protest against a criminal regime you wouldnt wait for the legalisation of your protest.. But claiming that they live in a dictatorship where they cant express their oppinion while in the same time they get the rights to do so. Better yet the police protects them.. <br>
These fuckers dont have a clue how a real Dictatorship feels, they are so weak they cant even breath thru a mask but they feel like Sophie Scholl, as long as no one else have another opinion and face them with it.</p>

        <p>"This separation of  government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so  gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even  intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true  patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises  and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not  see the slow motion underneath, of the whole process of  government  growing remoter and remoter. ''</p>
<p>"The dictatorship, and the whole process of its coming into being, was above all <em>diverting</em>.   It provided an excuse not to think for people who did not want to  think  anyway. I do not speak of your ‘little men,’ your baker and so  on; I speak of my colleagues and myself, learned men, mind you. Most of  us did  not want to think about fundamental things and never had. There  was no  need to. (The crisis) gave us some dreadful, fundamental things  to think  about—we were decent people—and kept us so busy with  continuous changes  and ‘crises’ and so fascinated, yes, fascinated, by  the machinations of  the ‘national enemies,’ without and within, that we  had no time to think  about these dreadful things that were growing,  little by little, all  around us. Unconsciously, I suppose, we were  grateful. Who wants to  think? ''</p>
<p>"To  live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it—please  try to believe me—unless one has a much greater degree of political  awareness, acuity, than most of us had ever had occasion to  develop. Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained  or, on occasion, ‘regretted,’ that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these ‘little measures’ that no patriotic German could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw it  developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.</p>
<p>''But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. <em>That’s</em> the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come   immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions  would  have been sufficiently shocked. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of  them  imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the  next.  Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a  stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  ''</p>

        <p>People who get upset at these comparisons think the person making the comparison is saying we are facing the same oppression as Jews in Nazi Germany. That's not it at all. The comparison is in the similarity between what Nazis did vs what we are doing today and that they didn't start by throwing people in gas chambers they started with things that didn't seem so bad at first.</p>

        <p>I'll give you a rundown of everything about the way they killed off the Jews in every way, step by step.</p>
<p>First of, to answer your question:</p>
<p>Jews were forced to hand over their travel documents in 1938.  They didn't receive any new ones and IF, they were stamped with a J.</p>
<p>From 1939 they had to carry passes with them and use added names "Israel" (for men) and "Sara" (for women) that were forced into them.</p>
<p>From September 1941 they had to wear yellow stars that identified them clearly as Jews.</p>
<p>Now to the additional information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Boykott of all Jewish stores, lawyers and doctors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Escape Fee" when Jews left the country (for good) they had to pay 25% of their assets as a tax. The original free amount was 200k, lowered to 50k when this was introduced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any Jew who wanted to leave the country permanently could take their belongings only with them if the state allowed it. For anything purchased after 1933 they had to pay 100% tax</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one is particularly interesting and might be applied to people who refuse to get the "vaccine" if the governments don't get stopped in time - from 30.04.1939 a house owner could kick out a Jew without warning, the same day. Jewish house owners should take in the Jews.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From October 1940 they deported 6000 Jews to France as a test on mass deportation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is of course not all, it's just a basic summary.</p>
<p>Point 1 has already been executed in our time for pretty much everyone except large corporations, food suppliers/shops etc with varying degrees in each country.</p>
<p>The vaccine passport is the equivalent of the yellow star and identification cards they were forced to carry with them.</p>
