    <strong>Help gather materials to empower friend Whose Ex-wife wants to vaccinate their Son</strong>
    <p><p>My friends Son[12] is a moderate-functioning autistic kid who has been made absolutely terrified of the covid pandemic. He shrinks in horror from anyone who he doesnt know and constantly repeats "I dont wanna get covid. I dont wanna die".</p>
<p>Anyway his ex-wife wants to get him vaccinated, and while my friend himself is vaccinated, he told me he is afraid because he has read about the heart conditions and so on. He also provides healthcare to his ex wife and their son.</p>
<p>I told him I would try and find him some links to good information for himself and his ex to consider. He cannot control what she does, but he thinks she is willing to look at well sourced materials.</p>
<p>I tried googling\duckduckgoing and could not find the WHO page that clearly says not to get kids vaccinated. </p>
<p>Can anyone be so kind as to help provide some links to information I can help my friend and his family with? I am going to not be lazy and will search the archive also, but if anyone sees this I would appreciate any input.</p>
<p>Thanks a ton NNN, you guys have been there for me.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you so much. This is one of the cases I have intended to find.</p>
<p>These people I am helping are not really capable of finding their own information. I am telling them to go ask their doctor about anything they read, but want to provide them with at least some information being hidden from common people like themselves!</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>I thought UK was already forcing kids to get them though?</p>
<p>I will go look for the NHS page that makes that policy clear. Thanks again!</p>
<p>I know I am being lazy by asking for help, but I am doing it because people here are helpful and I personally have been glad to help with information in the geo-political side of this nightmare that I am more knowledgeable about.</p>

        <p>Sorry I may have misgeneralized- little confusing with the U.K. laws - so it looks like the Pfizer only is approved for 12-15. However, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which is the U.K.’s official government vaccine advisory body, most recent public advisory stated that under 18s “<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/schoolkids-shouldnt-covid-jab-without-24328416">shouldn’t get the Covid vaccine without more data </a>. So it seems like a general advisory for them not to, yet somehow the Pfizer is allowed for a small age group. Kinda odd.</p>

        <p>Yeah. It is super sad what this pandemic has done to him, and presumably other kids like him. This boy does not just 'have autism' like the many people with aspbergers spectrum say. he HAS autism but is moderately functional - but not like an asppie genius. He can just barely function in normal public school - but this crazy covid stuff has just turned him into the perfect emotional-whipping boy for the Chicago school district and their alarmism and using kids against parents and so on.</p>
<p>I never thought I would ever hate the teachers union before 2019. I cannot believe how much my political views have been changed by this stuff.</p>
<p>he is literally shellshocked by the covid stuff - and both his parents are completely incapable of the type of shrewd rejection of bullshit that might lead to him getting some dose of reality. They are at the whims of their employers and deep-blue social conditions.</p>
<p>I think in the end the only actionable advice for them is going to be to try and wait as long as possible. Wait until school is about to start - so there is more time for the CDC to be forced to recognize the vaccine injuries and hopefully stop making kids get them.</p>
<p>I have read stories of other kids, without autism, who sound just as upset and freaked out and manipulated as this kid is - and it is very upsetting to me. It is all I can do not to tear up just thinking about how awful this is.</p>

        <p>It's not up to the WHO or CDC anyway. It's up to the legal guardian and parent to decide.  </p>

        <p>These are my views below, and then evidence to support them. <strong>What I need in this case is the many documented arguments made by WHO and other medical groups to NOT VACCINATE CHILDREN.</strong></p>
<p>Reading you can do on the 'great reset', which is what lockdowns are part of. These ideas in the WEF and sycophantic Time Magazine coverage of the WEF putsch are obviously at least quasi-Marxist. In reality these people are demanding a global super-state that owns all property and controls all commerce.</p>
<p>We can call it neo-Marxist because it is almost entirely predicated on Critical Theory and Critical Race Theory based false-dichotomies, historical revisionism, and above-all, Frankfurt Marxist style cultural propaganda.</p>
<p>Neo-Marxist anti-liberalism is dripping off the demands of the WEF and their globalist allies - and if you cannot recognize it, that is only because you are not knowledgeable enough in these topics to make critical observations and inferences.</p>

        <p>Yes. We are being 'great reset' based on alarmist medical-Lysenkoism, and these claims by globalist controlled medical bodies are not to be trusted, only used to defeat themselves as their many contradictory and illogical pronouncements and demands begin to pile up and are no longer deniable.</p>

        <p>I am asking for links to facts.  I mentioned two facts already in my statements.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>WHO and many doctors have now said not to vaccinate children</li>
<li>The vaccine is much more dangerous to children than Covid-19 is</li>
<li>The vaccine has caused many documented cases of myocarditis and heart inflammation in children. More and more have now died or been maimed.</li>
<li>There are entire countries refusing to vaccinate children</li>
<li>Many groups involved are actually releasing contradictory information on vaccine safety - some in the same publications, and other times it is in separate documents from different agencies within a larger organization</li>
<li>Many doctors are now refusing to make VAERS reports citing 'my license' when pushed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on.</p>
