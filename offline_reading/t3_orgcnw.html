        <p>I think they're just another way to spread the virus.  The vaccinated can still transmit Covid, yet they're being given free reign to do and go wherever.  I've also read that the vaccinated shed the spike protein... which also then leads to illness.  Coincidence?  I doubt it.  Pfizer's own documentation says that shedding is possible.  It's the perfect trojan horse set up, having the vaccinated seed the population with illness.</p>

        <p>I’ve thought about this before but I don’t understand why the powers at be are pushing so hard for people to get vaccinated so quickly. It feels like there’s some sort of deadline coming up. Something about being unvaccinated really bothers the deep state.</p>

        <p>The "control group" thing really is key I think. The more of us that are out here remaining healthy while the vaxxed fall ill, the more it exposes their lies about both the danger of Covid and the safety of the Vaxes.</p>

        <p>Keep an eye on Las Vegas. Will probably be the closest to a control group we will get.</p>
<p>Residents we are only about 40% vaxed and we have people from all over the country coming and going every weekend. Every variant will end up here, and the known ones already have I think. </p>
<p>CNN is going really hard at Nevada right now like they did with Florida and Texas. So much so my dad keeps panic emailing me with info on where to get the jab. Everything here is basically back to normal at the moment with the exception of employees having to wear masks again. We aren't dying in mass or anything. I have a feeling we will have a tiny spike over the next couple weeks then everything will be fine. We will see. I guess our mayor's petri dish idea will come to pass.</p>

        <p>I think it has more to do with the fact that mass vaccination like this causes the virus to mutate, thus ironically making the vaccine ineffective against new strains. Whereas being naturally infected provides long lasting immunity.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oj6lxr/a_doctor_explained_to_me_off_the_record_that/h4zzvx0">This thread contained an excellent explanation</a>, however, it's been deleted. I'll try to reconstruct from memory, but I'm not a doctor, so somebody else will have to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>The basic idea was that the vaccine only protects against part of the virus DNA code. Let's say the code is composed of the elements A0-B0-C0, and the vaccine encodes C0 only.</p>
<p>Now the virus mutates randomly in one of the parts: A1-B0-C0 or A0-B1-C0 or A0-B0-C1. In the first two cases, C0 is still there, so you're still protected. However, in the last case, the vaccine will not trigger and the virus can continue spreading to the vaccinated.</p>
<p>With immunity from a real infection, on the other hand, the immune system will remember the whole sequence of the virus. So even if one element mutates, the body will fight the new virus and potentially stop its spread.</p>
<p>Essentially, the vaccine makes the situation worse, in that it allows for mutations to flourish whereas natural immunity would have stopped it.</p>
<p>Again, I'm not a doctor, so I cannot vouch for this. If have more insight, please comment (and please don't delete your comment afterwards).</p>

        <p>I just watched all of that and now it's 3am. I was only gonna watch the first few mins! </p>
<p>Fascinating stuff. I really enjoyed it. He predicted precisely what appears to be happening now. One thing wasn't answered for me though.</p>
<p>So, the vaccinated people will cause the virus to mutate and become more and more infectious. Then they'll have no immune response at all to the variants as the vaccine won't recognise them at all. And that's a catastrophe that will soon happen. I fear for my vaccinated friends, the people who think I'm gonna die because I'm not vaccinated.. </p>
<p>But how does this effect the unvaccinated? We're fine if we've had covid because then we'll be immune to the variants. All good. I assume this means even the thousandth variant, or whatever we get to. </p>
<p>But, say we haven't had covid at all, like I don't think I have. And then we catch a variant down the line, the fiftieth or something. Is there a chance the variants could become more lethal at any point and so start killing the unvaccinated? I know variants tend to get more infectious and less lethal but is that a hard rule? If it is, then at least my unvaccinated family will be ok huh. </p>
<p>That's my main query. </p>
<p>And depending on your view on that... Basically I know a guy who has tested positive for covid yesterday. Would it be a good idea for me to infect myself and create the innate immune response to protect myself in future from variants? Or should I fear variants less than OG covid and just wait to naturally get one of those?</p>

        <p>I would still try to avoid getting infected if you can. So not a good idea to infect yourself on purpose IMO. I could be wrong, but there's no real guarantee that previous infection will help you much against a super variant anyways. I'm not taking the vaccine and trying not to get infected. I'm trying to avoid the spike protein... so that means avoiding the vaccine and the virus. So far so good for me.</p>
<p>I think it's pretty clear that the variants are getting more transmissible/contagious... but I think it remains to be seen whether they get more deadly or less deadly. The mutation could be less deadly to the unvaccinated, but more deadly to the vaccinated. If that's the case, just avoid getting infected, but if you do get infected in the future, it should be milder anyways. If it goes the other way, and is more deadly to the unvaccinated, and super deadly for the vaccinated... I suppose a prior infection to this current strain might be a benefit... but I'm still not willing to take the risk of purposefully infecting myself now with the hope of being better protected against a future more deadly strain. I still think it would really suck to get infected with this virus, but at least there's a bit of silver lining if I did, since I would then have some immunity against getting infected again.</p>
<p>According to his theory, people who get COVID and recover have the best immunity against a new variant... followed by people who haven't gotten COVID or the vaccine... and the vaccinated will be in the worst position. I don't think we're at that point yet as the vaccines do appear to provide some protection against severe disease... but that will probably change as the virus mutates more.</p>

        <p>Geert says that any vaccine-resistant variant that is bred by mass vaccination won’t necessarily be any more deadly than vanilla covid, except to vaccinated people whose suboptimal levels/types of vaccinal antibodies don’t neutralize the virus but block innate antibodies from binding to the virus, leaving both branches of the immune system crippled against covid. However, covid is inherently more dangerous when it runs rampant (which it will, thanks to the vaccines), because you’ve got a higher likelihood of catching the virus in the vulnerable few weeks after you’ve cleared an asymptomatic infection. In that event, the fine-tuning of your antibodies is interrupted by you clearing the infection, and your memory B cells haven’t been activated, so your adaptive antibodies wane over several weeks &amp; their suboptimal levels can cause a similar problem.</p>
<p>If covid has already made you moderately or severely ill, you should be immune to all possible variants. On the other hand, if a vaccine comes out that (1) isn’t spike-protein-based and (2) is shown to grant sterilizing immunity (completely preventing you from passing on the bug to others), you might want to take it to prepare for the “immune escape” eventuality.</p>

        <p>Exactly, and apparently the (epsilon?) variant is a mutation that has none of the proteins the mrna vaccines protects from. So what happens? Will we go back to square one? Re-vaccinate vaccinated people and be in lockdown while the new vaccine isn’t ready? It’s a shitshow</p>

<p>So even if vaxxed people can get delta, without the spikey its not as harmful. Would explain why cases soar but deaths stay relatively low in UK.</p>

        <p>So what's your point here? All of vaers is made up? Most of it's made up? Maybe none is made up or maybe most arent made up. Theres really no way in telling is there. </p>
<p>Even if half were made up, that leaves us with 6k deaths from the jab, which should be enough to halt this experiment, however no one wants to adress the numerous people dropping dead from the jab. </p>
<p>There are also lots of vaccine reporting systems throughout Europe. Check this <a href="http://www.indymedia.ie/vaccine_deaths">out</a>. Here  is another reporting system for Europe instead of vaers. Are you going to tell me that all these could be fake?</p>

        <p>It's not extremely rare.  You sure do like to convince yourself otherwise.</p>
<p>Enjoy being culled, sheep.  I respect the ones who received the vaccine who can understand our decision not to receive the vaccine, who can respect the phrase The Left loves to spew "My Body, My Choice"</p>
<p>Funny how that doesn't matter when it goes against your own narrative.  It is no longer "My Body, My Choice" when my own god damn Nurse Practitioner told me that the risks aren't worth it in my case.</p>
<p>I listened to my medical provider.  I guess I'm wrong for that too, huh?</p>

        <p>Im all fine with you going through without getting vaccinated but I do believe if you get sick from something you could have been prevented that you should be made to pay for the full medical costs and not pass it on to medical insurance where your decision could affect MY rates. Your body, your choice indeed. Just dont mess with my money.</p>

        <p>That would make sense if people weren't literally contracting and spreading COVID, regardless of having the vaccine.</p>
<p>But alas, you still can.  If I get the vaccine, still contract COVID and die, at least my intentions were pure?</p>
<p>How about if I get the vaccine and spread COVID, then that person died yet we're still both vaccinated?  Wont matter because at least I did my part in contributing to the 'evolution' of medicine?</p>
<p>My medical provider said it's in my best interest to NOT take the vaccine, so I could give fuckall about your money.</p>

        <p>Youre confusing fully vaccinated vs fully immune. There is a major difference. Yes, there are fully vaccinated people who get COVID. Some unfortunately do die. However the hospitalization rate, death rate are MUCH MUCH LOWER than those who are not vaccinated. 99% of hospiaizations and 99% of deaths are unvaccinated over the last 2-3 months. Youre flipping the argument where the onus on us to protect you. Simple, if your medical provider says not to take it good for you. Pat yourself on the back, have that gold star. i take comfort that im literally 99% less likely than you to get sick, or die from COVID-19.</p>

        <p>So, hypothetically, what if having the vaccine eventually increases your chances of getting seriously ill from future variants? </p>
<p>Would you say the same? That the vaccinated should pick up the bill themselves?</p>
<p>Or would you argue that because you followed government advice, you shoulder no responsibility for the mistake?</p>
<p>Because I have followed scientific advice rather than government advice. And I believe the vaccinated will end up very sick. But I would want medical insurance to cover any potential costs you incur. I just want people to live, even if they made the worst mistake of their life by participating in an experiment. Even you.</p>

        <p>Ok, your hypothetical has no basis in reality.  There has been 0 vaccines that have done your scenario throughout history. In fact its the opposite, it teaches your body about it so even varients, the body can recognize and respons to. </p>
<p>Enough with the what ifs and goalpost moving. What scientific advice did you refer to? link me to this supposed advice. Cause the science overwhelmingly states that its in your best interest to get the vaccine. The data and the science behind the vaccine are WIDELY available.

The Associated Press’ progressive bias is out of control
By Jonathan S. TobinOctober 22, 2020 | 6:59pm
Associated Press progressive bias
An aerial photo of a mural in Hollywood following the police-custody death of George Floyd.EPA
Media bias may be in the eye of the beholder, but the ability of journalists to slant the news can be demonstrated in ways that are both obvious and subtle.</p>
<p>Blatant bias was seen in the competing presidential town halls last week. In one, NBC’s Savannah Guthrie decided the job of the moderator was to debate, attack and interrupt President Trump. In the other, ABC’s moderator George Stephanopoulos tossed softballs to Joe Biden. That’s the kind of unfairness we’re used to with respect to coverage of Trump and Republicans.</p>
<p>But a more insidious form of media bias comes in the use of language and the way journalists use terms designed to favor the left. All you need to do to see examples of this is read the bible of American journalism: the AP Stylebook.</p>
<p>Published by The Associated Press, the Stylebook has, since its first edition came out in 1953, become the leading authority on grammar and style by reporters and editors as well a corporate-communication reference guide. Its updates about how to use words have even more influence on the way Americans speak and write than dictionaries.</p>
<p>While it may have started out as an objective source, as with so much of the media it serves, the Stylebook has long since discarded fairness for a liberal bias that betrays the goal of its authors and tilts the playing field against conservatives.</p>
<p>This was on display last month when the Stylebook weighed in to re-educate Americans about the “mostly peaceful” Black Lives Matter protests that resulted in violent riots and looting in hundreds of American cities since the death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>Since speaking the unvarnished truth necessarily paints these events in an unflattering light, the AP advised journalists to stop calling them “riots” and to use the more neutral “protests” instead — even if they were violent. Describing the pillaging of businesses by rioters as “looting” was denounced as racist.</p>

Doing their jobs and reporting what was happening was, the Stylebook claimed, to echo the practices of America’s racist past. In other words, reporters should believe those who are trying to portray a nation that has long since moved on from its troubled past as irredeemably racist rather than their lying eyes and ears.</p>
<p>The AP also wants the press to avoid using terms like “abolish” or “defunding” the police since it considers them inflammatory and instead describe these proposals in more detail. The goal there is to avoid the truth about a movement steeped in dangerous radical anti-police ideas.</p>
<p>Just as obvious was a recent AP article about the Democrats’ threats to pack the Supreme Court with liberals if they gain control of Congress next year. The article described one Democrat’s support for this idea as an effort to “depoliticize” the court.</p>
<p>That’s a partisan redefinition of a term that has been universally employed for decades, and it’s meant to avoid discussion of how the Democrats wish to blow up the judicial system.</p>
<p>The AP’s Orwellian “newspeak” isn’t new. For example, over the last decade, it forbade the use of “illegal immigrant” in favor of “undocumented,” a word that blurs the fact that some immigrants have entered the country illegally. It banished “Islamist” from the vocabulary of those covering the threat from radical Islam and said “terrorists” should be (misleadingly) referred to as “militants.”</p>
<p>Honest public discourse depends on calling things by their right names. But much like the current trend at many mainstream publications and broadcast outlets, where journalists think their job is now to fight Trump and conservatives rather than just report the facts and let the people decide, the AP Stylebook has become an eager recruit for left-wing Democratic activism and the anti-Trump “resistance.”</p>
<p>Those in the press who want to preserve an honorable profession necessary to a working democracy need to start ignoring the AP Stylebook and stick to truthful definitions."</p>

<p>The AP is biased liberal garbage, here's more lies</p>
<p>"In the wake of the horrific school shooting in Parkland, FL, a story emerged about the shooter being “trained” by a white nationalist group. The story had several holes from the onset, but that didn’t stop once-reputable organizations like the Associated Press from running and promoting it.</p>
<p>It soon became evident that the story was entirely manufactured by the leader of the white nationalist group; an unfortunately successful effort to give the group visibility and attract new recruits.</p>
<p>But even after it was widely known that this alleged “news” was entirely manufactured, the Associated Press refused to properly correct their promotion of the story.</p>
<p>It’s in that moment — in their refusal to properly correct the story — that the AP’s presumably inadvertent fake news, became the AP’s flagrant outright lie."</p>

<p>&rt;<strong>Overall, we rate the Associated Press borderline Left-Center Biased due to left-leaning editorializing</strong>, but Least Biased on the whole due to balanced story selection. We also rate them Very-High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.</p>
<p>Despite being sugar coated, as ALL MSM from right leaning FOX, to left leaning CNN, also try to "balance" their story selection to seem non-biased when, in fact, both are extremely biased.</p>
<p>Associated Press is no different.  They're all biased, they deliberately edit their columns to fit their narrative regardless of how convinced you are otherwise.</p>

        <p>Nice “science” there. Looks more like really amateur correlation fallacy to me. </p>
<p>You can kill organisms, but you need to make sure what you’re using actually kills them, and all of them. If it doesn’t, it will just drive evolution. Ie. survival of the fittest. Ie. mutations. </p>
<p>Coronaviruses, I think, are far too contagious to ever be eradicated with a vaccine campaign. Influenza is similar, and while we have vaccines for that the flu still exists. </p>
<p>The same will be true with sars-Cov-2. The vaccine is likely driving evolution, not preventing it.</p>

        <p>Well, first of all, Mr. “Science”, none of those have been eliminated. Second, with viruses like Polio, improved public sanitation has been equally responsible for eradicating it in <em>some</em> countries. </p>
<p>To use your same logic: why isn’t the flu eradicated even though we have a yearly vaccine for it?</p>
<p>You see, Mr. Science, you’re not actually doing science. You’re just making observations and correlations and then tainting it all with presumptions and politics. </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that, scientifically, we know very little about these vaccines OR this virus. It was just announced that the EUA for the PCR test is being revoked. What does that mean? Well... one of the principle sources of data collection that “science” has been using might be complete garbage. How can you reliably count “deaths” or “cases” or even judge vaccine efficacy if your test is flawed?</p>
<p>The default position of science is skepticism. By simply following the herd and regurgitating the authorities, you’re doing the opposite of science.</p>

        <p>The answers are there for all of your questions. The data especially. Look up the data between the introduction of the polio vaccine and the decline in the virus among the population. As for the flu were playing catch up, we could not develop a flu vaccine in under a year during the last major flu outbreak in you know….1918. Now there are so many varitations and mutations its incredibly difficult to produce a vaccine. </p>
<p>Which is why getting the coronavirus under control is insanely important and getting the vaccine helps cause it slows down transmission rates and slows down the rate of mutation. But im sure you knew that right? Cause you know soooooo much. </p>
<p>Playing ignorance isnt good on your behalf. Also I looked for your EUA pcr test and i see nothing so either link it or youre lying.</p>

        <p>The implication being that the COVID vaccine is sterilizing? It isn’t. That it’s in widespread use? Kinda. More like half, at best. Or that it wasn’t only introduced recently? As in a few months ago?</p>
<p>The important take away there was HIGHLY INFECTIOUS, moron. </p>
<p>This isn’t unknown to science. It’s basic evolutionary biology that an organism under pressure but still with a healthy enough population to reproduce, will mutate and evolve faster.</p>

        <p>You dont blabbering yet? Your own article owned you yet you try to continue. So basically your point is under pressure organisms will reproduce given the population. So wouldnt the vaccine help in stopping it? Or since you got a hard on for the fact its not sterilizing wouldnt it slow it down? Given that most infections that end up in the hospital with the delta varient are not vaccinated flies in the face of everything you said. Now if it was vaccinated people with the delta varient in hospitals you would be right.</p>
