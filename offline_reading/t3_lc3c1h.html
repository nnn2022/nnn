    <strong>I am on the verge of leaving Ireland</strong>
    <p><p>I can't take this shit anymore. I'm from the USA but I live in Ireland, and I'm having a hard time dealing with what the government is doing. When it comes to the vaccine, Ireland is doing decently well. Over 200,000 people have been vaccinated already and growing. Healthcare workers and vulnerable workers are getting the shot, in February we are moving on to over 70s, and they said there should be 100,000 a week done starting April, with hopes of it being available to everyone come September. Many countries haven't even started the vaccine yet, and yes there was the vaccine supply issue but that was quickly straightened.</p>
<p>However, the government absolutely REFUSES to have any type of optimism. They are fucking miserable. They're practically ignoring the fact that the vaccine is here and we're giving it to people as we speak; all they seem to care about is locking down and restrictions galore. Leo Varadkar says in one breath that things will be better by the spring and summer, but also adds that the lockdown probably won't end in March. He even added that Christmas travel for 2021 may not happen-even though we're supposed to have the majority vaccinated by September! How the hell does that make any sense? The government also keeps lying about reopening essential places like schools. TWICE they promised reopening special needs schools, then backed down and said they won't. They gave an official opening date but I don’t believe it’s going to happen because of their lies. Parents of special needs children are devastated, yet if you look at any comments on social media many people are mocking them, saying "just get over it, all our kids have to deal with this." The lack of humanity is so disgusting and I'm sick of these lockdown lovers pretending to care about other people because they clearly don't. This applies to people in every country, but I just wanted to add that because I've been seeing that lately and it shows how horrible humanity has gotten.</p>
<p>I went home to the USA for Christmas and despite what Ireland will tell you (they love to tell me how America is awful right now) life was actually good. People were taking precautions, but they were living their lives as well. I think Americans have realized that this virus is here but we can't stop living as well. Places in the states with the strictest and most extreme lockdowns are slowly starting to reopen despite Biden being president, and vaccines are going extremely quickly over there. I love it here in Europe, but I don't understand why European countries are so obsessed with locking down. Maybe they're trying to be the opposite of the USA? But I actually went to the US last month and it certainly was better. They aren’t treating innocent citizens like prisoners. Dr. Hooligan is extremely aggressive with bullying the government into being dicks to us, and a lot of people practically drool at the mention of him, ignoring the fact that his actions killed women a few years ago. Here everyone is completely miserable and depressed, but no one seems to be fighting back like in other countries. They actually seem resigned to it. I can’t take it anymore.</p>
<p>And now, the Gardai (police) will stop you on the way to the airport and fine you if you don't have a good enough reason to leave the country. The worst part? Many people support this extremely Orwellian move. I actually feel like they're trying to trap us in the country even though they have no right to.</p>
<p>If this bullshit continues into the summer, I am going back to America. And YES, I think life is better there right now than here in Ireland despite Reddit pretending it’s a horror show. I worked hard for over a year and saved up money for my dream of moving to Europe, and now that dream may be completely ruined.</p>
<p>Fuck you Leo, Mehole, and Tony. The three of you ruined more lives than saved.</p></p>
