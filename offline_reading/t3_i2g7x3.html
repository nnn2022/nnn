    <strong>Will there be an economic boom in red states like South Dakota where lockdowns are minimal?</strong>
    <p><p>In planning for the future economic devastation, there might be a very slight light at the end of the tunnel. I think that in the US, our major cities are about to experience devastation on a scale not seen since the Depression or maybe even Reconstruction. However, I think that states that position themselves now as more anti lockdown might be investment opportunities for tomorrow. I think most of reddit is based in cities like NYC, Austin, LA, and the like. But the are smaller towns across the country that are essentially almost normal. They might require masks, but people there know it's all for show. I would recommend that people start seeking out property and investments in smaller towns in red states. With the internet, there's not really a need to live in the giant hub cities anymore. And since those cities have shown that they will shut your private businesses down without even so much as a public referendum, those cities are going to collapse and lose their populations. Why would you stay in a city with no opportunities and the chance that your business could be destroyed by your representative government?</p></p>

        <p>Investment firms from Seattle are reportedly flocking to Arizona and their PRs have stated that their employees can live more affordable and peaceful lives here. I’ve only heard of minimal closures at the beginning for a few restaurants that hadn’t been open long and weren’t doing well before the shutdown. What’s still closed is minimal enough to be subsidized by the government while closed and other places that are open are roaring busy. I believe we will see even more of a population boom here and in more “flyover” states that didn’t have shutdowns like we are seeing on the east and west coasts.</p>

        <p>Yes and Georgia. You could see the population in those states as much as triple of quadruple. South Dakota though only has like 900,000 in the entire state and the state is big. It could absolutely take on a few million without a problem and still have tons of space. Georgia has 6 million but the winter weather is way more tolerable for most people and most of those 6 million live in Atlanta. So if you move outside of that it's not too bad. I'm already planning my move, I'm done with masks.</p>

        <p>Georgia has closer to 10 million people, but yeah, the majority live in the Atlanta metro so there’s lots of space.</p>
