    <strong>Don't Confuse Compliance With Caring</strong>
    <p><p>Strapping a piece of fabric over your face and recoiling from me like I have the fucking plague isn't my idea of empathy, so don't fucking act like you're doing this for my well-being or that you have some altruistic interest in protecting the elderly and vulnerable, all of whom you've condemned to over a year of isolation and solitary suffering. That whole "mY mAsK pRoTeCtS yOu aNd YoUR mAsK pRoTeCtS mE" excuse is such bullshit. If you truly believed that, if you really did have everyone's best interests at heart, you'd mind your own fucking business when someone goes outside without a mask on instead of getting in their face and publicly shaming them for virtue-signalling points. </p>
<p>Better yet, you'd fucking LISTEN to our legitimate concerns and grievances instead of just dismissing, mocking and simplifying them down into petty cries and whines of "i JuSt wAnT a HaIRcUt aNd a fEw bEeRs wItH thE bOyS!" You'd fucking ENTERTAIN our theories (most of which have come true over the past year) instead of strawmanning them into "LOL 5G aND LiZaRd PeOpLE!" </p>
<p>Let me go one step fucking further: if you really fucking cared about your fellow human beings you'd stop fucking complying with the authoritarian psychopaths running this endless circus performance because if you carry on deep-throating these tyrannical twats I fucking PROMISE you a lot more people are going to commit suicide, starve to death or just outright give up and die, and their blood will be on your hands. For every grandma you "save" (i.e. extend her life by her few shitty months) another person who had a full life ahead of them fucking dies.</p>
<p>This isn't living. All the humanity, joy and warmth has been sucked the fuck out and replaced with distrust, fear and paranoia. What defines being a "good person" has been deformed and twisted beyond all recognition into a hypochondriac grass and rule-stickler who treats their fellow humans with disgust and revulsion and who would have at best kept their head down during Nazi Germany and at worst actively participated in it, from snitching on their Jewish neighbours up to manning the  camp showers. Don't scoff, I've literally seen some of you lurking wankers in the comments practically salivating at the thought of doing the same to the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Grow a fucking backbone and think for yourself. How low is your self-esteem and self-worth that you actually believe you shouldn't be in control of your own body? That the government and Big Pharma know what's best for you? You're a fucking idiot if you actually believe the wankers who have cheated, lied and manipulated their way through this past year actually care about you. You are in an abusive relationship. Ditch it. How many red flags do you need to have inserted up your ass before you finally realize YOU ARE BEING FUCKED WITH HERE.</p></p>

        <p>I never knew people would be so obedient and accepting of having their lives destroyed. It has been shocking to me. I sometimes think all that stay positive shit really did a number on American's minds. Basically teaching people to smile like they are in a cult and that cult's name is America. The system is so corrupt, I don't trust any of them. They constantly lie, they constantly gaslight, they constantly threaten just like you said an abusive relationship.  Actually most of America should be pissed off alone that one and half years of our life has been wasted on this shit and endless trillions of dollars because some assholes either released this virus on purpose or let it spread all over the place and their "solution" to spike protein us to death is just as shitty as the virus. I hate celebrities, politicians and I think most of the professional class have sold their damn souls to move up the ranks, this truly is the take over of the narcissists and sociopaths.</p>
<p>Even there, their lies about PCR tests, surges, variants, endless symptoms--what won't covid do? has grown intolerable. I have noticed no one cares about the people who lost their businesses and money, no one cares about the kids who are about to be experimented on, no one cares about the fact that all joy and happiness have been stomped on or that we are living like we are in a prison cell with only video visitors allowed.</p>
<p>There seems to be no end in sight too. I am pissed off that valuable life years which due to my illnesses, I don't have too many of, are being wasted on this shit.</p>

        <p>The worst are the ones who are fully vaccinated and still wear masks. They have no legitimate reason to and are only doing it to virtue signal. Absolutely disgusting</p>
