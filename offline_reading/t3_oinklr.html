    <strong>Mental Health Support Offering</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone!  </p>
<p>**Please remove if not allowed. I am not trying to do anything shady.</p>
<p>I am a fully trained, license and insured counsellor based in Australia. My biggest concern with this whole COVID thing are those suffering the effects of lockdowns, the stress, and the alienation. It is understandable if you are feeling burnt out or discouraged for the future.<br>
NNN is a great community and a great place to vent, but in case you or someone you know could do with some deeper support, I'd love to take some time to help.</p>
<p>I am not here looking to capitalize. Just offering to chat with those that may need it, and am just assuring you that I am equipped to do so.</p>
<p>How to do it? Just shoot me a private message. I am comfortable with text-based counselling, as well as face-to-face through skype. </p>
<p>Thanks</p></p>

        <p>There is a fine line between delusions and concerns. Whether people are frustrated at non-compliance, or frustrated by blind obedience. We have all gone through enough stress for a lifetime. I don't mind what people want to talk about, so long as they don't want to enforce their will on other people.</p>

        <p>No delusions are by definition based on thin air. Unless you base your concerns on thin air too, they are vastly different things. Having concerns about the government killing people is wildly different from the delusion that the government kills people, don't you agree? I can agree with you on the rest.</p>

        <p>As a graduate in psychology (academic, not clinical) I can tell you that it doesn't matter if evidence preceded it or not, the fact is the delusion is there and you should treat it as is. If factors relating to the cause are vital for it's treatment then you can use those but whether evidence (or not) preceded the delusion is irrelevant for a delusion to be a delusion. The fact that you're questioning this combined with your statement at the end, clearly showing you have no idea what delusions are, makes me seriously doubt your credentials as a clinically trained psychologist. I reported you for impersonation; what you're doing is wildly irresponsible and dangerous.</p>

        <p>Thank you!  I should have ignored that human, but sometimes it‚Äôs hard to.   </p>
<p>I just read that long and painful conversation you had with that human.  You have the patience of a saint and I hope you are ok from it.  </p>
<p>If I was still in therapy, I would definitely seek you out.  You are fully awake to the Covid crap and that would be something that is high criteria for me, if I was seeking a therapist out.    I Hope you enjoy the rest of your day and night.</p>

        <p>It's interesting you say that because I mentioned neither of those points yet you're calling me delusional. This phenomenon is actually hugely interesting for OP as a counsellor. But I'll just say it right away: are you always so hostile and defensive? Must be tiring to feel like people are arguing against your beliefs <em>even when they aren't</em>. </p>
<p>I'm glad OP is here to witness this situation unfold. And this is low key exactly what I was warning OP about.</p>

<p>Can't defend your stance? Then get a better argument. Or better yet, get out. If you want to express your own perspective, go for it. If you want to come here and judge others make your own post.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, I don't care what the persons concerns are - pro covid measurs, or anti covid measures. I don't care if they are "delusional" or "concerned" based on your judgement.   </p>

        <p>Defend myself from what? What are you even talking about? You claim to be a professional counsellor, you approach a group of people that are known to be conspiracy theorists and antivax, this group has a high base rate of delusional beliefs. If I warn you of that and people of the before mentioned category reveal themselves to you then you as a professional have found exactly what you wanted to find when you came here; people in need of help. </p>
<p>I genuinely have no clue what you're talking about when you're talking about defending a stance or defending myself. I'm not arguing with anybody, I'm merely explaining to some what it means to have delusions. An explanation of an academically and clinically relevant construct is not an argument. On top of that, you not caring whether somebody is 'concerned' or 'delusional' is a significant professional flaw. Those are things you must absolutely distinguish from each other and again signals that you do not have the background you claim to have.</p>

        <p>You came into a subreddit of people that YOU assume to be delusional and conspiracy theorists, and then have people pushing back against you... because you are assuming they are delusional and conspiracy theorists. You are using your attempt at diagnosis to de-humanize their perspective and then project your own idea of what they think onto them.  </p>
<p>Do you have the capacity to empathize with WHY they might be in No New Normal? Do you know that many people here simply get judged in their personal lives for asking questions? Or maybe the videos of vaccine reactions is scary to them? Or they naturally don't like authority very much and are stressed out? Or the lockdowns give them a sense of of uncertainty for their lives and their futures?  </p>
<p>Yeah sure. Some people go to extremes in what they think, but that isn't true for absolutely everybody. Both atheists and evangelicals comment in here and aren't attacking each other even on that. People are here because they feel comfortable. They aren't all the same nor share the same concerns.</p>

        <p>I don't base people off samples and statistics because that does absolutely nothing for me when I deal with a person. It generally doesn't help people. Yeah, I can know the aspects of certain demographics or the patterns of certain cognitive issues, but that doesn't tell me about the person, their values, their beliefs, or why they are the way they are. They are no a delusional person, or a depressed person. They are just a person, and we deal with what ever we need to as we need to. Coming in with assumptions doesn't get me very far and can make me ignorant in my treatment.</p>

        <p>That's not true, ignoring base rates is an error in clinical psychology. Especially when you have a whole catalogue of personal information about a person available via their profile backlog. If you get a bunch of war veterans as patients you need to be mindful of the increased odds of e.g. PTSD symptoms. Those aren't 'assumptions', those are statistical probabilities you're taking into account. Besides, if a person is a delusional or depressed person then you should be helping them with those symptoms not accepting that they are 'just a depressed person'.</p>

        <p>Yes. A certain demographic can statistically be prone to certain issues, such as veterans with ptsd. That doesn't tell me that EVERY veteran is see has ptsd, and so I will not talk with them starting with the assumption that they do. I will just be mindful that there is a chance. Then I will let the persons experiences speak for themselves. <br>
Their file is a good way to familiarize myself with a client but it doesn't actually do anything for my relationship with the client. I have received intake forms that made it sound like the person was catastrophe on legs. They were perfectly fine as a person. Yeah, some issues, but nothing like their file would indicate.</p>
<p>If the persons needs to be helped with those symptoms, or the symptoms overlap with other parts of their life. I will help them in those regards. Depression or ptsd doesn't just... manifest in a person. Sometimes it is genuine brain trauma, in which case that is a neurological issue not a psychological issue. If it is the former then it is a symptom of a physical illness and the treatment would be different. If it's a psychological issue, then it is also likely a symptom arising from an a lack of quality and wellbeing in life or some issue with how they relate to the world. If I look at what might be facilitating the depression then it helps the depression. Someone might be depressed because their life is not going so great. It won't help to treat them as a depressed person. They are a person with a tough life who are feeling depressed.</p>

        <p>I am not saying that keeping in mind base rates mean that every veteran has PTSD.. unless the base rate is 100%. </p>
<p>Now what I find the most important question is why you are uncertain about the vaccine when you are, as a psychologist, trained in the scientific method and statistics and therefore can evaluate the research on vaccinations yourself?</p>

        <p>Because... as a trained counsellor... that specifically focuses on personal wellbeing and the therapeutic relationship, not statistics or diagnosis. My concern with the vaccine is the trends surrounding its administration. The VAERS database has shown that there have been approx 9000 deaths from the vaccines since January, and far more complications. There have been 900 flu vaccine deaths... ever. These issues are also occurring in young populations who are statistically unlikely to have a bad experience with COVID. Which is concerning. But the vaccines are being pushed to be mandated and people are being ridiculed for being resistant to taking it. I am concerned that a broader conversation has not been allowed, even if the ideas are wrong.   </p>
<p>Doesn't mean that covid is less bad or less of an issue. Only that the vaccine is potentially ALSO an issue for some people.</p>

        <p>Look at this scientific article: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4599698/</a></p>
<p>It explicitly warns against drawing conclusions from VAERS. Why are you doing it anyway? You're supposed to be trained in the scientific method! You're a 'trained counsellor'!</p>
<p>Besides, this article: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2020-2021/death-south-korea-following-flu-vaccination.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2020-2021/death-south-korea-following-flu-vaccination.htm</a>, says that 59 deaths occurred after flu vaccinations since October 26 in South Korea ALONE. So you're saying that over 5% of all flu vaccine deaths in the history of mankind, occurred within roughly half a year and in South Korea? Isn't that an insane finding based on your 'research'? Or are your numbers just completely off? By the way, these deaths only occurred in 70-80 year olds and older that had existing serious health issues, just a 'small, insignificant fact'.</p>
<p>Listen, if you are truly a counsellor then I can see why people bash the field of psychology so much for not being a true science, it's because of people like you that represent psychology but do not represent any knowledge of the scientific method and scientific knowledge. Your thoughts and ideas are based on such bad information, do you have nobody in your direct environment to tell you 'hey bud you should take another look at that'?</p>
