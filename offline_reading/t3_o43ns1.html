    <strong>What will it take for you to wake up?</strong>
    <p><p>Some of us knew straight away that this was a nothing-burger. Some of us became skeptical when videos from China of people falling dead in the street began leaking out; only for none of that shit to happen anywhere else in the World. Some of us put our foot down when they started mandating masks and ushering in the "new normal". Some of us couldn't believe it when nurses started dancing on Tik-Tok and scientists and the media came out in support of "mostly peaceful" BLM protests, all whilst demonizing and shaming anti-lockdown protests as "super spreader" events. Finally, some of us woke up once the miracle "vaccines" maimed or outright killed someone they love after a year of seeing no one die from (read: WITH) this virus.</p>
<p>What the fuck is it going to take for you to wake up? Worldwide, governments and the media have lied in lockstep, fear-mongered like fuck, and profited whilst many of us suffered and burnt through our savings. Whether you believe this was all orchestrated as part of some nefarious scheme or just a stupid fucking overreaction, there is one absolute truth: this has gone too fucking far. They are trying to force children to take this fucking untested, experimental "vaccine" now. They are going to make our lives living Hell if we don't comply and have the jab. We have lost our freedom and humanity over this shit.</p>
<p>I think we are seeing more people wake up now but there are still many who refuse to stand up and dig their heads out of the sand. They're afraid; not of the virus, but of the reaction from others. I have a friend whose Dad has fallen seriously ill after having the vaccine and he absolutely REFUSES to admit that the jab is the reason why. Went from talking about it on Twitter every other day to radio-silence and blanket-denial after the test results came back. I can only surmise that he's afraid that if he posts about it all of his SJW, Branch Covidian followers will rip him to fucking shreds. I'm sure he rationalizes it in his head as not wanting to scare people out of getting it; well, fuck him.</p></p>

        <p>The fact that there's worldwide rallies for freedom and no one bats an eye is mind-boggling. If covid was truly a deadly plague that requires a new (ab)normal...literally no one would be marching for freedom.</p>

        <p>Or, when there are anti-lockdown protests they are "Putting everyone in danger" with police shuting them down, in contrast, BLM protests are totally fine because "Racial justice" with police bending a knee in "solidarity". </p>

        <p>I don't think it's that they dont bat an eye, I think it that people really don't believe the world is in chaos right now. So many people just watch/read MSM, and leave it at that. </p>
<p>all the rallys overseas, none of that is making the news. The misinformation from CNN that the unvaccinated are a minority, there fore, if you're unvaccinated, you're a strangler and a problem. </p>

        <p>A two tier society has well and truly been created. There is no point lying to ourselves anymore the damage is done. </p>
<p>Looking through our eyes it’s not about the fact they have been vaccinated it’s that we live in a country where a large majority of the vaccinated pop have no backbone, would turn on you rather than fight for freedom, would leave you to die if it was a choice between you or them and would happily see you lose your livelihood, home, family and spit on you in the street even if it meant your suicide just to save themselves. </p>
<p>These people are sick and Inhumane and I no longer want anything to do with any of them.</p>

        <p>I think I was kinda skeptical from the very start. <br>
Early March 2020 I was on holiday in egypt. We almost didnt get to leave cause Covid was starting to appear in my country for the first time then. When i was there i got a serious cold. (Guess we'll never know if that was covid or not, but it was one of the words headcolds i've ever had.) I was sniffling and my nose was running and generally felt bad. And since Covid was starting to become a bit of a concern then people treated me like a leper. Even at the time i remember thinking.  "Okay so even if i have it and i feel pretty bad.; it's still just basically a heavy cold. Why are people freaking out."  </p>
<p>Then when we were rushed home cause egypt was closing its borders i was genuinely a bit worried for a little while. I just assume they wouldn't yank us home like that for a simple cold. But 3 weeks later and with not a semblance of normal life in sight i started to smell a rat.   </p>
<p>The original  "break the curve in 2 weeks" was gone by then and shit was getting weird. I did the whole distancing thing quite obediently but then when Public transport started demanding masks and later the whole nation i figured "No, I'm not doing this anymore" And the rest is history. I started my first ever modding position on  r-fuckmasks  shortly after and then here on this sub and have been here and resisting ever since.</p>

<p>Yeah- because the cameras would always be pointing directly at the individual who "unexpectedly" keeled over- catching him/herself with their hands as they hit the ground.  Totally not staged.... no, really!</p>

        <p>Back in March 2021 I calculated that mid June twice the worlds population would be infected playing around with given numbers, infection rate, ways of transmission and hospitalization percentages and all that BS they were so damn shure about. Came May and there were no bodies piling in the street I realized my consuption of apocalyptic movies and literature (Contagion, The Stand etc.) got the better of me.</p>

        <p>A few suicides of people I knew did it. It's really sad. I was always skeptical of the lockdowns and the masks but went about thinking "can't hurt anyone to just do their part, right?"</p>
<p>But after those, I started to question lockdowns as a valid method as they seemed to be doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>When I raised such questions to fellow covid-followers I would be chastised. I was told these 18 and 19 years (I believe those were their ages) died for the greater good. This pissed me off. These kids had many good years ahead of them.</p>
<p>I splintered entirely from there when it became clear  there was zero objective thought on the other side. They refused to question anything that was passed down to them by office experts and outright rejected the voice of on-the-ground experts that spoke against it.</p>
<p>They wanted to be parented by the government and refused to see anything that hinted that that should not be the case. They optimistically believed the government and the trillionaires could do no wrong and were there for the greater good.</p>
<p>&rt;<em>When you see the world through rose colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.</em></p>
<p>The key? I believe it is Emotional connection. Data, science, and facts can be erased, fabricated, manipulated, censored, or outright rejected to fit the other side's narrative. But you can't erase love or joy or sympathy.</p>
<p>As more people fall prey to the vaccines, those around them will start to question things. I hope those people have the objectivity to listen to their hearts. Those with hardened hearts are already gone, sadly.</p>

        <p>I honestly believe that eventually this will blow up in everyone's faces (media, government, medical, etc.) And it will be such a huge explosion that they cannot cover it up. Only then will everyone wake up. I honestly believe it's around the corner if we just hold on for a little bit longer. If you look, people are starting to notice the censorship. People are starting to take notice to the major news networks not reporting certain things. I promise that the house of cards is starting to shake a little.</p>

        <p>It is a very serious virus for just some. We know some of who the some are, but not all. But we also know that there are extremely effective treatments that if given early in the progression, are 100% effective. There is no need to die from this virus unless you wait until it's too late, which was the early fatal advice. Or your government prevents you from using the proven effective treatments.</p>

        <p>Are you serious, must have a very small circle of friends, family, and coworkers...</p>
<p>Over 2 dozen of my close circle of friends (healthy, fairly young) got it. It was literally a 2 day flu for most of them, they laughed it off. I think another 2 dozen of us had it but just never had symptoms and/or got tested. I'm fairly sure I had it, but my immune system crushed it. </p>
<p>The only 'horror' stories I've heard are from very unreliable sources, like a friend of a friend's ex coworker, etc. Of course if you're and 80 year old diabetic any sickness is dangerous though.</p>

        <p>I recently helped a neighbor who was having a seizure. 911 was called and firemen and an ambulance show up. I am sitting behind the kid (25) to keep him on his side and it’s hard because he is bigger than me. I have no idea if this was shot related. So I asked the firemen if they could trade places with me and they just stood there, I was super annoyed. I was not masked but they all were. There was one that was asking questions who had a gas mask like thing. I could not hear or understand her through that. Finally the EMT’s took over. 
So irritating. I have had 2 colds since covid began. My husband and kid are both sick with a cold now, but I didn’t get it. Yeah for good old fashioned immunity.
I wear my mask under my chin if at all. I hate Oregon politics.</p>

        <p>I've come to realize and accept the fact that there is no true freedom on this planet. Unless you run away to an island and hermit mode until death. But if you want to be part of a society, you have to follow rules. You have to work to exchange your time for paper money, document everthing to the gov (house purchase, car, marriage, pay your rental fee to live in the system (taxes)) and just enjoy the ride. You will be provided with roads, Healthcare, shopping malls, events, entertainment, travel opportunities etc. But you can't be truly free....only free in a space that is given to you. Like a brain in its skull.</p>
<p>And in the space of freedom that is given to you, it can be manipulated towards whatever those with money want. 💰 money is the root cause of all this chaos but it's what keeps things in order.</p>

<p>Did he actually end up getting the vaccine I doubt it I would assume that he would have found a doctor that would have treated him with the full spectrum protocol...as opposed to so many of the doctors that aren't treating people.</p>

        <p>I guess my question would be- if there really is malicious intent behind all of this, what is the end goal? What do they gain from giving people the vaccine? It can’t be population control because what would any corporations or governments gain from less people. And it can’t be tracking because we’ve got all our phones to do that for them. So what would benefit them to do this?</p>

        <p>The true goal was on the part of a small group of technocratic elites (the WEF, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg group) whose goal is to seize control of the entire world in a single government led by them.</p>
<p>The reason for all of this trickery on the part of the elites is <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">the Great Reset</a>. Broadly speaking, the Great Reset is a plan involving remaking the world’s economic and political systems on the basis that what we have now doesn’t work. There are many components of the Great Reset, lbut the core theme of it is sustainability in the form of “carbon neutrality,” as they put it.</p>
<p>That sounds good on the surface, even if they are taking advantage of the pandemic as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset">“a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world.”</a> As the saying goes, though, the devil is in the details—besides <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles">phasing out fossil fuels</a>, they will be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9501565/How-Bidens-climate-plan-affect-everyday-Americans.html">cutting red meat consumption to just 4lbs per year (a 90% reduction)</a>, forcing people to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/04/04/home-radiators-will-have-ten-degrees-cooler-britain-reach-net/">turn their heaters 10 degrees Celsius cooler</a>, <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/299414/REP_Absolute_Zero_V3_20200505.pdf?sequence=9&amp;isAllowed=y">stopping shipping and air travel completely</a>, and many other things besides. Most ominous is the WEF’s vision for 2030, which involves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBBxWtKKQiA">people “owning nothing” yet being “happy.”</a></p>
<p>The first of two major methods they are using to begin is process is COVID vaccination, which they are using to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/05/15/vaccine-passports-covid-19-vaccine-verification-coming/7130642002/">introduce vaccine passports</a>, the first of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine.html">having already been rolled out in New York (the Excelsior pass)</a>, to which it is conspicuously easy to attach a digital wallet. And this will likely be the next step, given the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/">WEF’s open support of a cashless society.</a> It does not really need spelling out (but I will do so anyway) that the reason for this is to remove physical money from the equation in order to establish control; it is all well and good if you have money, but if you can’t use it because it’s all in the cloud and you’ve engaged in too many “dissident” activities,  then it doesn’t matter if you’re a broke college student or a multimillionaire—you’re still not going to be able to feed yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">The prevailing theory regarding taking away everyone’s property and possessions (or their ownership of them, at first) is that there will be a debt forgiveness program</a> (note: while I don’t know how true it is that that link is an actual leak, I am providing it because it makes logical sense, and shows I am not just making up my own theories on this). Once the economy has crashes, the government will say something like “we know the economy is terrible and you don’t have a job, the money to pay your debts, or the means to put food on the table; but if you join our debt forgiveness program, it’ll all go away, and you’ll receive a UBI payment, too.” But in order to join the program, you’ll have to be vaccinated and give up ownership of all your possessions. This would include money (after all, money is used to buy possessions).</p>
<p>The second way is through the budding cyber pandemic, which <a href="https://youtu.be/0DKRvS-C04o">Klaus Schwab himself said will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience, and will involve a grid-down scenario.</a> Indeed, there have already been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/">attacks on SolarWinds and FireEye</a>. Most troublingly, FireEye’s offensive toolkit, one of the best in the world and normally used to test defensive software for large corporations and the government, was stolen in the hack. This was preceded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210531124228/https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/from-event-201-to-cyber-polygon-the-wefs-simulation-of-a-coming-cyber-pandemic/">Cyber Polygon 2020, which conspicuously was planning for that exact type of hack, reminiscent of how Event 201 preceded the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by just a few weeks</a>, and will shortly be followed by <a href="https://cyberpolygon.com">Cyber Polygon 2021 on July 9th</a>.</p>
<p>They will use this second line of offense to justify the creation of a new system, since the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, along with the shipping container and crop shortages (and other artificial agricultural vulnerabilities), will trigger a depression worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s and prove to the people that the current system doesn’t work.</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t even half of what is going on here, so I highly encourage you to look into it yourself.</p>

        <p>Money is the answer - to some extent. Big Pharma is making billions (fun fact: Pfizer already confirmed a third shot is on the way). Big Tech is making billions. Corporations are making billions (small businesses aka the competion have been destroyed due to endless &amp; needless lockdowns). Governments and politicians have more power than ever. Everyone wins, except Joe Average.</p>
<p>And the worst thing? The powers now see how easy it is to pull this of. They can keep extending this indefinitely for years, or do it all over again for some other low IFR virus. The public now thinks this is a completely normal response to a mild respiratory virus.</p>

        <p>So I think money is probably the best answer to this question. I’m still questioning what the government gains from this, but that assumes they’re not benefiting from the big corporations.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to look at this more than a few different ways and while I certainly can believe there are people who would absolutely abuse the situation for gain, it all just seems too grand to be a big conspiracy.</p>
<p>If we assume the vaccine was for population control or monitoring, then 1) they’d have to kill off a lot of people with it which wouldn’t be good for the corporations who’ve created them and 2) again our phones are already tracking us for them. Additionally, wouldn’t less people around mean less money for anybody at the top or benefitting from this situation? I guess to me less people with less freedom doesn’t equal more profits for anyone except maybe big pharma and the government. </p>
<p>But maybe I’m getting this all wrong. I’m jumping to the assumption that most people who have beliefs that align with this sub are saying it’s some grand conspiracy to control the masses and make lots of money. But in reality it’s probably more something akin to corporations and government heads realizing they can take advantage of the current situation, and dragging it out so long as it benefits them to do so</p>

        <p>&rt;wouldn’t less people around mean less money for anybody at the top or benefitting from this situation?</p>
<p>The top 1% already have all the money and already own everything important, they don't need us for anything anymore. All the manufacturing going on presently is just to sustain us, the overwise 'useless feeders' which is all we are to them. Whatever work needs to be done after 90% are  all exterminated will be done by AI. I'm always surprised when people like you don't know or realize this- it's been that way for decades now- even more surprised because you're smart in every other way.</p>

        <p>They're insane though. Think they have the right to dictate who lives and who dies, and how we live, for the "greater good". They and theirs will always be exceptions to the rules, though, cause they're compassionate and civilized. It's the dirty peasants who are causing all the problems, not their civilized superior peers.</p>

        <p>The answer can only be speculative at this point, but no answer is required in order to legitimize observations about the lies we're being told. You don't need to know the liar's purpose to recognize that they've told you a lie.</p>
