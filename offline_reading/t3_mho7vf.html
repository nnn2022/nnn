    <strong>A sincere post to you Pro-Lockdown folk</strong>
    <p><p>The thing is...it's been over a year now. People are sick, tired, broke and losing patience with lockdowns. You have a brain, you gotta use it don't just ride with the so called "experts".</p>
<p>What makes you think the government sponsored eXpErTs are better than the anti lockdown experts who are ignored and silenced by our government and media? Doctors have DIFFERENT opinions you know!</p>
<p>A vaccine so good for a virus with a 99.9% survival rate will never ever make sense no matter how you slice it. A vaccine that just "decreases symptoms" sucks and it's not worth injecting yourself with. Fuck it, lets say you go and get it, how long before your next dose and the next one? The "experts" say you still need masks, the only present you get is a new "passport".</p>
<p>Just think, the wealthiest 1% could eradicate child poverty in a few days but instead they're more concerned with "covid-19". Like ringing bells and roosters crowing constantly reminding us how DEADLY and absolutely HORRIFYING covid-19 is...</p>
<p>This virus came out the blue, there's so much conspiracy around it because it literally came out of nowhere so people are sceptical, so desperately trying to intimidate 7.8 billion people to inject themselves with a "new" vaccine sounds like a sick ploy to me, honestly sounds like population control under the carpet. I mean technically it's the only way to control our population, you think our rulers would be honest and just tell us to have less kids? Nah...they'll just get your dumbass to keep injecting yourself and do it for them.</p>
<p>This whole thing stinks...Wal-Mart is open but Gyms are closed...seriously why punish the gyms for Wal-Mart's sins??? If they open Wal-Mart &amp; Costco then covid-19 will spread anyway! It's an invisible respiratory virus...and even than how many people have to lose jobs, commit suicide, get locked down a whole year in to all this! We're still back at step zero! Even Albert Einstein told us that doing the same damn thing over &amp; over is WRONG. </p>
<p>If people like you don't wake up we'll just be having this EXACT discussion next Summer. I swear to god.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;e you don't wake up we'll just be having this EXACT discussion next Summer. I swear to god.</p>
<p>I hate to say it. But this is never going away and even if it somehow magically disappears, the economic impacts and what not, will always stay around.</p>
<p>And tbh, these doomers are like the tail of a dog. No matter how much you try to straighten it, the tail will always remain crooked. No matter how much common sense and logic you show these doomers, they will never get it.</p>
<p>And, 1 thing that I realized is, most of these doomers are miserable people, who wish their misery upon All of us. F them. Let them suck off the government and their Lord saviour Fauci and be slaves on a leash.</p>
<p>While for people like Me and you, just fight till the end, no matter what it takes. I rather die with a spine than living all my life as a slave to this corrupt government. Doomers if you're reading this, Go to hell. May you be miserable forever and that Fauci use you as the slaves you are. Go F yourselves.</p>

        <p>Here's my message to pro-lockdown folk: try and make me stay home, I fucking dare you.  You won't do shit, because you're a spineless little coward and will piss your pants and run to mommy the instant you face resistance.</p>
<p>My immune system can easily fight off the coof, yours can't do shit about 5.56.</p>
