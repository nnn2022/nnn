    <strong>Societal productivity</strong>
    <p><p>I know there are economic measures (which aren't good), but a lot of productivity is intangible. This makes it a challenge to talk about. Where do you think we are right now?</p>
<p>Something that's been pervading my thoughts for months now is that there's just no news! Nothing is happening! In the high tech space, no movement at all — no new gadgets, software, or business. In the art space, almost no new movies or shows or games. In the societal discussion space, I can't think of a single new thought in months — people are yelling into the void or forgoing it entirely. Physically, we're surely all putting on pounds and becoming less active on average. </p>
<p>What are some other things... Are we putting as much effort into our daily responsibilities? Are parents as active in their childrens lives, or are they burying themselves in things/distractions, and are their kids too? Are we having as much grassroots organization as before? Are politicians actually even doing their jobs — are they are working as hard? Are business leaders doing their jobs, or are they on autopilot?</p>
<p>Is it just me, or does it seem like the entire world is on autopilot?</p>
<p>I think this is what the "New Normal" is really about.</p></p>

        <p>High tech is still being developed, you just aren’t hearing about it.</p>
<p>Infact, I’m sure there’s all kinds of high tech that we don’t know about...</p>

        <p>Is it being developed as much as it was five years ago? Ten years ago? One year ago?</p>
<p>It's not a binary situation, obviously, and there's certainly some fog of war associated.</p>
