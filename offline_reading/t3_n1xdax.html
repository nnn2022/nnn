    <strong>Someone I know got COVID long after being vaccinated 1st dose, but how isn't the Government - who aren't following their own rules getting COVID? Is this virus magic?</strong>
    <p><p>I know he got it from being near a unvaccinated person having the virus thinking it was safe, so it was spread by it. But how is it possible that so many governors, and riots that break their rules never catch the virus?</p></p>

<li>You can't "know" he got it from an unvaccinated person. That can only be a guess.</li>
<li>The PCR is no test. So testing positive doesn't say anything.</li>
<li>Viruses don't spread. I suggest you get new info regarding germ theory vs. terrain theory. "Viruses" vs. exosomes.</li>
<li>He got sick. Not because of someone else, but probably because there's something wrong inside his body (his terrain).</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you ever wondered why Covid also doesn't seem to effect Covid-deniers?</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m not sure where you can find it, but someone showed me a scholarly article that hinted at it being a bio weapon.  If you really think about it that would make sense, I mean it was probably made by China to nix Trump in all honesty.</p>
