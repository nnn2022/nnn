    <strong>The Canadian government and media’s willingness to mislead and manipulate the Canadian population and what the end goal appears to be.</strong>
    <p><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic I have noticed some quite disturbing behaviour on the part of the Canadian government and media. It seems as though they are more than willing to mislead or manipulate the Canadian population if it suits their agenda and the implications of this are vast and far-reaching.</p>
<p>The first instance of this manipulation and deception I speak of comes in the form of misrepresentation of current COVID cases to the Canadian public.</p>
<p>The protocol that is currently being followed is to report all positive tests as a case of COVID-19, the major issue with that is the fact that the test that is most widely used and has been since the beginning of the pandemic is the PCR test (polymerase chain reaction).</p>
<p>By the Canadian government’s own admission this test can produce false positives up to 50% of the time. This was mentioned during an Ontario public health broadcast by Dr. Barbara yaffe, the Director of Communicable Disease Control &amp; Associate Medical Officer of Health for Toronto Public Health.
I will provide the link below:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/3COXVbP5WdI</p>
<p>When the question arises of why teachers are not forced to regularly participate in mandatory testing she says, and I quote:</p>
<p>“You know I think a lot of people think the testing is going to really solve the whole problem and it isn’t, it’s one component of a response. If you test somebody today, uh, you only know if they’re infected today. And in fact if you’re testing in a population that doesn’t have very much Covid, you’ll get false positives almost half the time. That is the person actually doesn’t have Covid, they have something else, they may have nothing. Uh, so it will just complicate the picture.” End quote.</p>
<p>So what we can draw from this is that when asked, the Canadian government openly admits the fallibility and inaccuracy of the tests being used, yet the government and the media continue to use positive PCR tests as the main criteria for how many current cases we have.
This is a clear cut case of deception and manipulation.</p>
<p>I think this shows that the Canadian government and media are more than willing to present us with inaccurate information, models, statistics when it suits their interests and agenda, presenting them as legitimate and deceiving the masses. This is reprehensible behaviour on the part of both and we should not stand for it.</p>
<p>It gets even worse when you ponder their reason for presenting inaccurate information to the public. 
The reason why they are engaging in an act of deceit against us is because they are attempting to keep us in a perpetual state of fear of the virus and compliance to the new restrictions and ways of life we are now expected to comply with and shape our lives around.</p>
<p>What they are doing is laying the groundwork for the great reset. They are attempting to disrupt our previous ways of life and present us with our “new normal”, then keep us all terrified and compliant as to progress into the new world order as smoothly as possible with minimal disruption.</p>
<p>The entire idea of the great reset is purely just a rebrand of the new world order. This is supported by the fact that the layout for the great reset has been settled upon for years and has been open to the public on the World Economic Forum’s website for years now.</p>
<p>They have just taken advantage of the crisis at hand like the globalists they are and rebranded their vision for a new world order of global governance and totalitarian technocracy under the slogan of ”the great reset.” </p>
<p>Well there’s nothing great about it, to be frank. This global shift will affect everything from economic systems, currency, governance, to your own personal ways of life. Mass surveillance will become the “new normal” just as complying with our current restrictions has and it will only get more totalitarian from there on.</p>
<p>Cash will be replaced by digital currency and as a consequence the new system of global governance will have full and complete leeway to monitor all of your financial activity, transactions, business dealings and down the line possibly even go as far as restricting who is deemed to be an approved entity to engage in business with and who is not. </p>
<p>They have even made reference to arm bands that monitor your vitals that will allow the new global governance to know when you are sick before you are even aware yourself.</p>
<p>It’s an absolute dystopian nightmare.</p>
<p>This will end only when we choose to stand up and make it end.</p>
<p>Dwell on your freedom, your ways of life you cherish and value. Don’t let them be taken from you so easily.
Stand up for what you know to be correct. </p>
<p>I and many others like me will be standing next to you.</p>
<p>All is not lost. Choose to wake up and object to tyranny rather than rolling over in complacent apathy.
Fight for the future of humanity, fight for what’s right.</p>
<p>Rise up.</p></p>
