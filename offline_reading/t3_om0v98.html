    <p><p>I get that y'all don't want non-sympathizers here, fair enough, each sub has its values and preferences. The reason I post this is because I had folks asking me questions in response to my comments on another post and wanted to reply - they were good questions. I don't think I was rude (you all can judge for yourself, I've left the comments up, just see my history). I suppose I wanted to point out the confirmation bias in how this sub is moderated. If that's what you all prefer, fine; like I said, each sub has their values. But I wanted those who were offering rebuttals to my statements to know that I wanted to keep talking, but wasn't permitted. </p>
<p>Not really expecting this to go through, though. Had to at least try. Cheers.</p></p>
