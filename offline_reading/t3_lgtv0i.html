<p>I honestly don’t see this part happening. Everyone would just come up with some bullshit like “no one’s dying because all the kids and teachers are wearing masks and distancing!” Meanwhile, any single death of anyone involved in a school will be broadcast far and wide and used to lecture us on how opening schools was an obviously terrible decision.</p>
<p>When people are judging these decisions on intentions rather than results, and when they perceive the intentions of lockdown to be inherently righteous, their minds will never change even when the results are positive. Just look at Florida.</p>

        <p>My take is that since teachers are largely insufferable liberals, the teachers' union is one big doomer fest. The establishment seems to want schools open (why else has the media covered this story for so long?), but they're having a hard time getting through the union. They're kicking and screaming, citing the very propaganda that the establishment fed them lol. They seem to be making headway in Chicago, last I heard.</p>

        <p>Indeed my wife’s school district union passed up a $4000 bonus per teacher to get back to work by feb 1. Now they’re whining because their union failed to negotiate pay raises for the next school year.</p>
<p>Teachers are the only industry I can think of that have not returned to work. I told her they have zero bargaining position left after that, and she agrees, that profession is on the brink of total collapse, and unfortunately the suffering of our children isn’t enough to bring them back.</p>

        <p>Schools reopening will require them to completely shift their narrative. If you truly believe that this virus is super deadly, it's logical to believe that people should work from home, businesses should be closed, and kids should avoid school. But if kids go back to school, they will have to come up with a reason why it's ok for kids to go to school, but other things have to stay closed.</p>

        <p>Its crazy. So much of it is geographic and cultural. I live in Utah, which has been one of the most open places in the country this whole time. Everything has been open since last May. Schools have been in person for almost everyone this whole school year. To my knowledge there aren't even capacity limits in restaurants anymore. Very few people are still working from home. There were over 4000 people in attendance at the Jazz game last night. The only real restriction is a loosely enforced mask mandate that wasn't issued statewide until November (though stores have had them in place since June), and while people do generally comply, most lazily wear their masks under their noses, and no one freaks out about it. And even with one of the most lax lockdowns in the country, Utah has the 6th fewest deaths per million in the country. We aren't swimming in dead bodies over here. There was a spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths during the fall, like every other place in the Northern Hemisphere, but things never came close to the nightmare scenario doomers have been preaching about since March. And without doing anything, cases, hospitalizations and deaths peaked around the end of November/beginning of December on their own. And what do you know, the same thing happened in every state in the region, regardless of restrictions. 
But I grew up in Seattle, and still have family and friends there. And just recently the indoor dining ban was lifted and schools are starting to consider opening up. But to listen to the reactions to this is so bizarre. They act like eating at a restaurant indoors or having children go to school in person is reckless and terrifying. It's so strange. It might be understandable if Washington State had some massive outbreak and was leading the world in deaths. But nope, they have the 7th fewest deaths per million, right behind Utah. It is so crazy. But thats just how the collective culture has evolved up there, and to downplay covid at all is dangerous heresy. It's tragic.</p>

        <p>Doomers/liberals are in a headspace where they don't actually believe anything they say. They just repeat the talking points of the elite because it's always the safe move. It's sort of a survival mechanism gone awry. Large cities are centers of power, that's why they're so liberal. My school is in a big urban center, and holy shit it's like another world to read the subreddit for it. They talk so nonchalantly about wanting the vaccine, whether it's safe to visit the library, being scared to commute to campus, etc.  </p>
<p>I was initially scared too, but after a month of anticipation there was never any 'collapse'. Nothing catastrophic happened; life continued as normal. I got bored of being scared. Meanwhile doomers are <em>still</em> repeating the talking points I was saying back then about superspreader events and such. It's like they have no capacity for skepticism. They just keep running on the hamster wheel, repeating what they've been told. It makes them feel safe in the arms of the power structure.</p>
