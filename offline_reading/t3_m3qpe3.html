    <strong>This Lockdown Isn’t a Quarantine and It is Probably Aiding the Spread of the Virus</strong>
    <p><p>This situation that we are currently experiencing can properly be called a “lockdown,” however, a quarantine it is not.</p>
<p>In a quarantine, you limit all access to other people. In this hoaxed quarantine, you can go to the supermarket with a bunch of people there whenever you want.</p>
<p>Anyone can catch a virus at these grocery stores, and then bring it home to the old people that they live with, who can then die of it.</p>
<p>The air in a house circulates, so it is actually likely that by locking down the country, and forcing people who were exposed to the coronavirus or other flu viruses (all of the deaths from any respiratory illness, and most every other illness period, are now being counted as “coronavirus” deaths) at the grocery store – as everyone is – to stay inside with their family members all day long, you are likely increasing the infection rate.</p>
<p>What we have is simply an economic lockdown, where people are forced to cancel their entire lives for absolutely no reason.</p>
<p>Sweden refused to go along with the lockdown, and has allowed people to continue to live their lives normally. Not only have they not seen some mass death situation, but they’ve actually seen a lower mortality rate than the United Kingdom, where the standard “shut down everything except the grocery store and maybe a couple other things” system has been put in place.</p>
<p>The concept of locking people down but allowing them to congregate in groups at the grocery store multiple times per week is so insane that it is almost unfathomable that this could be done for any reason other than maliciousness. While it is possible that it actually increases the death toll, it is an absolute certainty nothing we’ve done can possibly lower it.</p>
<p>If we had decided that the most important thing in the universe was to keep people in their 70s and 80s and those with existing clinical chronic illness from dying of the flu, and used science to decide how to best do that, also deciding that the cost didn’t matter because “lives before the economy,” what we would have decided to do would be to put the old and sickly in a real quarantine. They would be kept in sterile environments and attended to by people in full hazmat suits (like what Africans and WHO did with Ebola). Everyone else could obviously continue on with their life normally.</p>
<p>Instead, we did this.</p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>This is a managed implosion of the economy, and the entire society that it fuels. The virus hysteria provides a framework for allowing the government to have free reign to manage the collapse, and try to create the outcome that they want from it. So don’t expect that there is ever going to be a point when they tell us that this corona flu virus is no longer a risk, and we can simply go back to normal procedures as we attempt to manage our collapsed economy.</p>
<p>The coronavirus is the new eternal invisible enemy. The media and the government tried to create this kind of boogieman with “Russian hackers,” and despite pouring billions of dollars into the propaganda, it didn’t work. This flu hysteria works better than anything has ever worked before. Everyone is simply trusting that these government people must have their best interests in mind.</p></p>

<p>Very much this. The lockdowns provided a scapegoat for the financial crisis which has been building since '08. The Fed had to intervene in bond/repo markets late 2019. A few months later the 'rona is released. Coincidence?</p>

<hr>
<p>&rt; From FDA.gov:
&rt; From February through the middle of May, the FDA issued a total of 59 EUAs for IVDs for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 based on validation data using contrived specimens derived from SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. As the pandemic progressed and more patient specimens became available, on May 11, 2020, <strong>the FDA recommended in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests that developers obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests.</strong> So just from Feb-May 59 tests were authorized (so how many since then?) and the FDE recommended testing against real samples.  </p>
<p><strong>I can’t believe they would actually allow test developers to obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests without isolating, purifying and examining under an electron microscope. UNREAL.</strong>  </p>

<hr>
<p>&rt; “I think if a country said, “You know, we need to end this epidemic,” They could quietly send around a memo saying: “We shouldn’t be having the cutoff at 37. If we put it at 32, the number of positive tests drops dramatically. If it’s still not enough, well, you know, 30 or 28 or something like that. So, you can control the sensitivity.”  </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">Yes, you read that right. Labs can manipulate how many “cases’ of Covid-19 their country has. Is this how the Chinese made their case load vanish all of a sudden?</a>  </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”  </p>
<p>&rt;But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rt;Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  </p>
<p>&rt;But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like <a href="https://bpa-pathology.com/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/">“No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification”</a>   </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Countless labs have reported a 100 percent positivity rate, which means every single person tested was positive. Other labs had very high positivity rates. FOX 35 News found that testing sites like one local Centra Care reported that 83 people were tested and all tested positive. Then, NCF Diagnostics in Alachua reported 88 percent of tests were positive.  </p>
<p>&rt;How could that be? FOX 35 News investigated these astronomical numbers, contacting every local location mentioned in the report.  </p>
<p>&rt;The report showed that Orlando Health had a 98 percent positivity rate. However, when FOX 35 News contacted the hospital, they confirmed errors in the report. <a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-florida-department-of-health-says-some-labs-have-not-reported-negative-covid-19-results">Orlando Health's positivity rate is only <strong>9.4 percent, not 98 percent</strong> as in the report.</a>   </p>

<p>&rt;Development of new vaccine technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current RNA based SARS- CoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing. In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients. The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations. In the current analysis a total of sixteen UG tandem repeats (ΨGΨG) were identified and additional UG (ΨG) rich sequences were identified. Two GGΨA sequences were found. Potential G Quadruplex sequences are possibly present but a more sophisticated computer program is needed to verify these. Furthermore, the spike protein, created by the translation of the vaccine RNA, binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a zinc containing enzyme. This interaction has the potential to increase intracellular zinc. Zinc ions have been shown to cause the transformation of TDP-43 to its pathologic prion configuration. The folding of TDP-43 and FUS into their pathologic prion confirmations is known to cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases. The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.  </p>
