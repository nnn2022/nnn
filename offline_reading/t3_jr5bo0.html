    <strong>Why are people so genuinely surprised if and when they get covid, and still refuse to admit masks don't work?</strong>
    <p><p>Do people honestly and genuinely think a mask will stop an airborne virus? When people say, "This wouldn't all be happening if everyone just wore a damn mask" - most people <em>are</em> because there are mandates, and what, do they expect the virus to just disappear or cease to exist because masks eradicated it? Or that the masks will keep the virus at bay for months before a vaccine is created?</p>
<p>My sister has a church acquaintance who is super pro mask, pro lockdown, pro fear mongering, etc. Her daughter was supposed to have a birthday party yesterday but her husband got the virus and she was saying she didn't understand how he got it, they barely went out, he wore a mask, etc.</p>
<p>How is this not a wake up call for these folks? They did everything "right" but still got it. A FB acquaintance made a post saying despite doing everything right he and his mom got it, but they were fine, but also fear the virus. What is the takeaway dude?</p>
<p>I don't understand how people aren't connecting the dots here.</p></p>

        <p>They are operating on emotion and not logic. They can't accept the reality of how a contagious endemic virus spreads, and so they must find somebody to blame it on. When they've been putting in a ton of effort with santizing, distancing, mask wearing and <em>still</em> catch it, they're pissed. They can't accept that while we can try our best to be careful, we might be unlucky and catch it anyway. No, no, there has to be a villian to point at -- it's all the fault of Trump-voter Cletus who went to Walmart without a mask that one time.</p>

        <p>This. My dad recently tested positive and my mom told me she blamed me because I used to be against masks (I told her I wear masks now to make her feel better). I reminded her that viruses are good at spreading and that we never used to blame each other for getting sick. She then apologized in so many words. Funny thing is that my mom and I are now sick, so it wasn't my fault!</p>

        <p>So they are mask fanatics in public, and frightened of covid, yet they are throwing a birthday party?!? ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ The messaging on covid is just asinine...passing someone in the aisle at  Home Depot without a mask (zomg!!!! Iâ€™m gonna catch covid for SURE!) but throwing a frickin party is a-ok and not a problem at all. Ummmmm? ðŸ¤£ You are massively more likely to catch covid from a PARTY than from passing by someone at a store. Do these people have any common sense at all?!</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve seen people actually say that masks are effective but the no maskers are the ones spreading the disease, and the doomers are safe.</p>
<p>But how maskers get covid then? I think someone might go check fb, pretty the answer to everything is there. /s</p>
