    <p><p>Probably absolutely nothing.</p></p>

        <p>I get the feeling some who have adverse affects are finding out there's nowhere to go to talk about it. I even think some are hiding the effects [well the less severe ones that aren't killing them outright]</p>
<p>You all need to realize autoimmune diseases are the ones they delay diagnosing. One of mine took many years to diagnose, I am not kidding about this either. I even had vasculitis that idiot doctors thought was "scabies". [tested negative for that too] Even with my own forehead eating itself, [skin sores are often part of lupus related conditions] I had to write endless complaint letters to go see rheumatologist that finally saw me and I was vindicated.  I hate to say it but most of these people getting autoimmune problems from the vaccines are going to be screwed, until they are on their literal death beds, they probably won't get much help.</p>

        <p>Inflammation is a large culprit of anxiety related symptoms that gets commonly ignored, another is hormone dis-regulation. If things like diet can significantly impact anxiety levels then pretending anxiety is a purely psychological problem is ignorant, especially when you're injecting something designed to cause a significant immune response. Your brain is a physical organ, mental health is connected the physical health more than people will like to admit.</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree but to say that people are just nervous, is not fair. </p>
<p>A severe reaction with seizures and lack of ability to walk isn't just bad nerves. Especially when the people were actually happy to take the vaccine and had no history of anxiety problems.</p>

        <p>Right... My local news phrased it like this "you may have been hearing acounts of adverse reactions... Well, those were investigated... And it turns out they were caused by anxiety!"</p>
<p>Like how did they determine this? Is there a pee test for anxiety? Did they biopsy a blood clot and the cells spelled "anxiety" under magnification? A breathalyzer? "Anxiety symptom" seems like a diagnosis by exclusion so how did they rule out the vaccine?</p>
