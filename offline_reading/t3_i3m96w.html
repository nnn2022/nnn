    <strong>It's just until after the elections...</strong>
    <p><p>I'm seeing and hearing that statement a lot. That everything will go back to normal after the election. It would be wonderful if it were true, but are we <em>really</em> believing what we are saying? I used to be an eternal optimist who also had realism thrown in there, but I have zero hope that things will get better. This is it. We will get small "privileges" back, but this is the new normal (as much as I despise all of it).</p>
<p>First off, other countries who don't have a Presidential (or equivalent) election coming up are throwing your rights out the window. Police want to come into your home for no reason? In Victoria, Australia that is now a reality. I don't know about you, but suspecting covid is not a valid reason to intrude in my home without a warrant. Secondly, all these changes felt permanent, even early on. Normalizing cancel culture was the perfect catalyst to ensure that anyone who questions anything the MSM tells you gets shut up immediately. Thirdly, the fear porn is being shoved down your throat, it's becoming increasingly difficult to turn it off. It is everywhere. Signs with cute underhanded threats ("a crowded park is a closed park!" accompanied by a smiling cartoon animal), or plain in-your-face ominous reminders of being a murderer if you don't obey are everywhere. Newscasts are using any little piece of information that they can get to scare the shit out of people. And the information is usually pretty weak, but the way they convey their messages is downright fear-inducing until you actually listen to what is being said, but I feel like people have become accustomed to mindlessly regurgitating scary-sounding headlines to scare others, then others further regurgitate said scary headlines. Anything against the hivemind gets canceled, doxxed, whatever you want to call it. It's not just pointing and laughing; it's contacting employers and ensuring they are reprimanded, if not fired: "do you really want to keep employing this mass-murderer?" "This Drumpf supporter should die!" (For the record, I don't support this president or any other government official; they're all full of shit and their rivalries are theater so we think someone actually is looking out for their citizens)</p>
<p>For the doomers who want to call me an uneducated murderer, know that I was one of you a few months ago. I was all about following the numbers on the news, telling people to "stay the fuck home," and all that. But with time, it wasn't making sense anymore. "Just two weeks!" lost its meaning. The "experts" were not only constantly contradicting themselves, they made it sound like it was OK to do so and to just trust whatever they're saying on that particular day. So I shut down all social media, got off Google news and looked to primary sources of information. In the meantime, I had multiple family members contract and recover from covid. Yes, this is a real virus with a high mortality rate in the medically vulnerable. But looking at the details of what is being imposed on us is not consistent with the virus itself.</p></p>

        <p>What's happening here is happening in countries all around the world. Currently, Melbourne and Victoria Australia are on lockdown again; no one can leave their homes except to go for food and, then, only one member of the household can leave and only travel within five kilometers, or about three miles.</p>
<p>People in Honduras and Paraguay have been beaten in the streets for leaving their homes.</p>
<p>There was a massive march/protest in Berlin, Germany, over the weekend. Estimates of at least 20, 000 Germans showed up to protest the lockdowns, mask requirements and other restrictions.</p>
<p>There was a smaller protest in Hyde Park over the weekend, also protesting mask requirements and other restrictions in London.</p>
<p>In Qatar, people are forced by law to download a contact tracing app to their phones.</p>
<p>The covid 19 scam will definitely affect our elections, but it's not about our elections and it won't be over in November.</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I truly am. I wish it weren't so, but this is the beginning of a global takeover, the ushering in of a one world government.</p>

        <p>The Trump psyop is the scariest part of this whole thing. Lots of patriotic good ol' boys got swindled into thinking that Trump is pro-freedom or that he's only reluctantly going along with Fauci, or that it's all 4D chess or something. </p>
<p>Trump falsely declared a "national emergency". Trump launched "Operation Warp Speed" and showered Big Pharma with billions for a sketchy vaccine. Trump is funded by the greasy casino oligarch, Sheldon Adelson, whose agenda is a mark-of-the-Beast biometric cashless payment system. </p>
<p>Trump supporters need to pull themselves together and disavow this freedom-trampling Judas-goat before it's too late.</p>
<p>The Democrats are bad too, obviously, but the Trump cabal is in power at the moment.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say you're wrong, but the Democrats are 100x worse than Trump. They are actively courting these dark forces, BLM, China, the Fauci/Gates/Pharma cartel. That being said, I think those of us who are sensible should vote Libertarian.</p>

        <p>My favorite line people say is this will all go away after Trump wins. Ok, but how? He’s already president and didn’t do anything to stop the complete dystopia from occurring. No matter the outcome of the election, this won’t go away until the actual agenda is complete.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I see the "this will go away after Biden wins, so let's vote for him" mantra much more frequently on here and at LDS than the opposite. For the record, I think there's a plethora of possibilities on what could happen after the election, but there's no "sure thing" on it swinging one way or another if either of them wins.</p>

        <p>Clearly this has political ramifications worldwide.  Personally, I believe this just helps further some nefarious, UN, global governance scheme. </p>
<p>This virus allows a great amount of control immediately.  Clearly, Australia isn't trying to directly influence the US election, but the politicians there have their own agendas just like the ones here.</p>
<p>I believe, in the US, this looses steam after the election. It will continue to be used as cover in the media unless something else comes along.</p>
<p>You see any stories about Obama and Biden weaponizating the FBI and DOJ to spy on Trump and rig the election? How about Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein? </p>
<p>Don't think this nonsense isn't politically benefitting people, it is.</p>

        <p>It doesn't really matter who wins the election. Our real leaders are selected, not elected, and most people barely know their names. To think we'll all go back to the "old normal" as soon as Trump or Biden or Harambe or Kanye wins the ~~suggestion box for slaves~~ presidential election is America-centric and just plain naive.</p>
