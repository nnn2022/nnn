<p>If the unvaxxed are the problem - and this was a known risk - then:</p>
<p>A) Why didn't the 'ExPeRtZ' wait before they had 16 billion doses to vaxx everyone simultaneously around the world to prevent VaRiAnTz, </p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>B) Where were these VaRiAnTz prior to late Dec 2020 when the entire planet was unvaxxed and the virus had had an entire year to mutate?</p>

        <p>1) Even if they could. People would refuse to take it because it was untested. So they whole waiting would be pointless. People still refuse to take it and data backs it up that it works.
2) Same people who refuse to take it/don’t have access to it. It’s simple evolution. The virus replicates itself millions of times in each body. As it does so, it’s slightly different every time. Eventually its spike is different than what the vaccine was designed for, and now we need another vaccine. Just like the flu. We will need to play catch up until people learn to mask up, stay home, get vaccine, and not spread the damn thing for 2 weeks. That’s all it takes. But people keep dragging this on. We all want this to be over, all it takes is a bit of effort. Edit: Earlier the virus was in pockets, so even if there were variants, they were very similar or died off. Just like now we’re only up to what, 4 major ones?</p>

        <p>It's late here (after 1am) and I can't tell if you are just woefully ignorant or a paid-by-Big-Pharma sycophant.</p>
<ol>
<li>We're 16 MONTHS into this fiasco and you have the TEMERITY to say " mask up, stay home, get vaccine, and not spread the damn thing for 2 weeks. That’s all it takes." </li>
<li>No, there's a constellation of Greek-lettered variants. Do epsilon, lambda, iota, kappa and eta sound familiar? Oh, I bet that you've only heard of two (at most) because those are the only ones that your authoritative TV science experts have told you to worry about. No-one who truly trusts the science would be so behind the curve when it came to this DeAdLy PaNdEmIc.</li>
<li>The idea that everyone has to be vaxxed is so intellectually bankrupt esp. when no advanced country in the world vaccinates against TB - a disease that infects 10s of millions and kills \~1.6M annually \~ and has currently infected 13M US citizens. Where are the global vaxx mandates to compel 8B people to receive the BCG vaxx?</li>
<li>Before you reply with "TB has treatments" you should remember that there are drug-resistant strains of the pathogen - XDR-TB and MDR-TB - that are killing grannies and brown people all around the world! Think of the brown people and grannies!!! I know that you don't know any of this because none of your authoritative TV science experts have told you to worry about them.</li>
<li>Yes, C19 has MANY peer-reviewed treatments that were blocked for financial reasons - vit D, ivermectin, dexamethasone, etc. Too bad they are generic drugs and can't be patented.</li>
<li>If the vaxx worked so well, the CDC would never have changed it's testing criteria by lowering the RT-PCR threshold to &lt;28 and ONLY reporting hospitalisations and deaths. If the vaxx were effective, there would have been no need to manipulate the testing criteria. </li>
<li>If you're going to shill, then have the capacity to do it convincingly. The other variants did not "die off." Just because your authoritative TV science experts have not mentioned alpha, beta and gamma in a while doesn't mean they became extinct.</li>

<li>Because then more people would have died waiting, that’s like advocating that we not load some people onto lifeboats until the rescue ship has arrived at the sinking one.</li>
<li>Variants did show up prior to December 2020, the British one was detected months before that. Ur claim is factually incorrect.</li>

<li>You're right! There were no treatments and the peer-reviewed studies about HCQ, ivermectin, vit D, etc were all flights of fancies peddled by mad scientists.</li>
<li>May I remind you that there were trials in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa in 2020 which were 'proven' to be SaFe AnD eFfEcTiVe against the eponymous VaRiAnTz? There was no hypochondriac hyperventilating then, so what is so special now beside the plot to get rid of the anti-vaxx control group?</li>

<li>Trumps own FDA revoked the use of HCQ for COVID due to not being effective against COVID. The same FDA many now cling to not approving the vaccines yet as a reason to not take them, There was no approved or emergency authorized treatment for COVID. </li>
<li>You moved the goalpost, first you claimed variants weren’t showing up in 2020 and now ur claiming they weren’t covered by the press. That’s likely because we had the more pressing matter of a massive wave hitting us at the the time, losing thousands per day. The variants are protected against for the vaccinated, studies show this. The government trying to get people vaccinated so the American south doesn’t have another massive wave is them doing their job.</li>

<li>Not from the US, so the FDA has no bearing on my life, you TDS patient. That said, the FDA revoked HCQ because of a bogus paper from the Lancet which was retracted. </li>
<li>They weren't showing up in the press (why is this hard to grasp?) and the vaxx candidates were lauded on their ability to be EfFeCtIvE. </li>
<li>Last I checked, the American South no longer exists as the n-th wave exterminated them after they followed the lead of TX and FL in removing all restrictions. Only the compliant states survived and have no idea of which "American South" you speak. Mexico invaded the former-US South. Didn't you hear this in the news?</li>
