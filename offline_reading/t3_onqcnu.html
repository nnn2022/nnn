    <strong>A fully vaccinated person became infected with Corona at the Salzburg Festival. Consequence? From now on, all visitors must wear FFP2 masks. Always remember: Vaccination is the way out of the pandemic :D Vaccination is the way back to the old normal life :D</strong>
    <p><p>Too funny. Hopefully the 44 contact persons will be put in quarantine too. This is the only way a few more sheeps will wake up.</p>

<p>&rt;Corona alarm at the Salzburg Festival: A visitor to the festival tested positive for the corona virus on Sunday evening. The person had attended the premiere of "Jedermann" on Saturday. "The infected person was fully immunized," said the festival broadcast. Nevertheless, the festival is tightening its prevention concept: From now on, every visitor must wear an FFP2 mask.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Due to the personalization of the tickets as part of the extensive prevention concept, festival employees were able to transmit the data of 44 contact persons to the authorities. “Contact tracing is in full swing,” it was explained. The corresponding legal regulations and the measures of the prevention concept have been implemented in full.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"Due to this regrettable case, we decided, together with the health authorities and the expert advisory board, that we will now implement the planned next security level of the prevention concept: From tomorrow, every visitor in all venues will be required to wear the FFP2 mask," explained Lukas Crepaz, the commercial director of the Salzburg Festival.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;As planned, the prevention concept will continue to be adapted to developments in the pandemic.</p>
