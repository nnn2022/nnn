        <p>I do go outside, but I dont put others at an unessacarily risk. I dont go to the besch, because I dont NEED to go to the beach. I will go on walks with the dog daily, but i have a mask, in a park, that is comepletely empty most of the time. I am simply saying that it does save people, and that you shouldn't put your own self interests over the lives of others.</p>

        <p>Its not really being hypocritical, because when I do go for a walk in the park, I am 
Alone
I have a Mask
The park is empty, seeing as I got between my classes, meaning it is at about 9AM on weekdays
I keep my distance from people
(And this is a huge park, with like 20 square miles of land)</p>
<p>What you guys are advocating for is
No masks
No social distancing
A complete return to normalcy that endangers people</p>
<p>There is a clear difference between these, if you cant see that, it wont suprise me, but god help you. </p>
<p>I am not advocating for completely turtling for months. Just reasonable stuff. You dont NEED to get up on People in line, or always sit shoulder to shoulder. Does it suck sometimes? Yeah. But saving people, and flattening the curve, more important than anything. I dont care how bad i want to go to the park, if it is going to genuinely endanger people I wont go. Thats the difference between me going to the park, and people congregating on a beach, or reopening schools completely.</p>

        <p>I have a speech disorder. My vocal cords don't function at proper volume and I was close to aphonic most of my life. Masks prohibit me from being heard when I go out. Plus, people can't see my lips to try to decipher what I'm saying. I've been going outside, for a year now, and have not been able to talk to anyone in public. Unless I am in my home, unmasked, they won't hear me. I would love to be the person who says "I have a medical disability" because I legitimately do. But I don't because those people ruined it. For now I wear a mask so people like you can continue to call yourself compassionate and understanding. Please don't stereotype and call all of us selfish.</p>

        <p>No, you wear a mask to prevent the spread of coronavirus, that's the only reason you are wearing it. Nobody is telling you to wear a mask so they can call themselves compassionate and understanding. I dont have to call myself compassionate and understanding, i just do it. You not being heard doesnt kill anybody or yourself, but not wearing a mask does, so the mask is necessary. We are all suppose to be chipping in to help stop the pandemic. You are just being biased and divisive because you act like youre the only person that matters. You are just selfish.</p>

        <p>And you regurgitate your arguments straight from buzzfeed headlines seems like. Seriously you got anything besides "PeOPle are DyIng" or "SeLFisH"? As far as I'm concerned there are far greater dangers out there, and shaming people for taking risks, cause you're too scared to take them yourself, is pathetic. </p>
<p>Not sure where you are located but in America we practice Liberty for all. Maybe not as strictly in recent times - authoritarian presidents are seemingly becoming very popular - but I and others will always fight for personal freedom and choice. Especially when it comes to my government destroying the economy, livelihood of millions, and mental and physical health across the country over a virus with a 99.7% survivability chance. Another fun fact - of the people hospitalized <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/08/covid-cdc-study-finds-roughly-78percent-of-people-hospitalized-were-overweight-or-obese.html">78% were found to be obese</a>.
 Why should I help people who won't help themselves?</p>

        <p>The only reason you attempt to trivialize the numbers and dangers of covid is because you know very well your freedom ends when the public's health becomes a factor. You have no legitimate justification for putting people in danger so you attack the very people giving us the facts of the crisis to serve your own self interest. It's pathetic.</p>

        <p>"Trivialize" </p>
<p>You mean look and use data provided to make my own critical rational decisions? Just because it's not the conclusion you have come to doesn't mean I'm trivalizing anything. It means I can look at data analytically and without bias.</p>

        <p>Cool, just link your doctorate that gives you the authority to make such important decisions for the public, wait, you dont have a single accreditation to your name? I didnt come to these conclusions, medical experts did. We dont put randos on the internet in charge of public health. You dont get to make your own conclusions when the public health is in danger.</p>

        <p>Just because I'm not credited to a lab doesn't mean I don't have common sense or a higher risk tolerance than the general public. If you are at risk stay inside, I don't care. Stay away from young people if they're so scared. It is not a problem for 99.7% of people. Math and data is always more important than some random guy on the TV.</p>

        <p>How, how is that the only guideline that makes sense to you?? What doesnt make sense about the fact that masks, limit the amount of germs that you exhale onto open air? And if you are farther away from a person, say, 6 feet, it is even more unlikely that people will breathe in those germs?</p>

        <p>So why is there no correlation in mortality outcome between states with harsh restrictions vs states with no or minimal restrictions? Why are countries like Sweden who had mimimal restrictions showing no abnormal mumber of total excess deaths deaths pet capita when compared to previous years? Is this also just a big anecdote?</p>

        <p>Why do think that restrictions are necessary to act responsible?
Did you know that the most people wouldn't murder other people even if there is no law against it?
Only a sadistic asshole or a psychopath wouldn't respect other people's life.
A little bit socialism would also be good for the American culture. 
Not all of you need to be psychopaths.</p>

        <p>Not everyone wore masks, covid isnt on the up the entire year, and the first spike can be explained by the initial spread of the virus, and the 2 week incibation period. The second spike is because of the holidays, and people decided to go out with their family's, which helps spread the virus more and more. A well as trump rallys, states raising restrictions early, and anti mask protest. </p>

        <p>Influenza is less infectious then covid.</p>
<p>The symptoms for influenza appearing faster, that means that the illness is easier to detect and also that the infected will very soon feel sick and are not willing to go outside until they recover.</p>
<p>Mask in general are not perfect but they help to reduce the risk.
It comparable to a protective vest in a battle, it can help unless you get shot directly in your face.</p>
<p>Mask and social distancing are the only explanation why I don't catch the flu this year.
Nothing else is different then the last ten years.</p>

        <p>It still doesn't make any sense at all how one of the most omnipresent viruses in the world would just magically disappear due to masks. Even many studies prior to March 2020 shown that masks were never significantly effective at reducing transmission of Influenza. It's painfully obvious that flu deaths the past year became part of covid.</p>

        <p>it's obvious that the flu is rare these days because restrictions are working.
same applies for other illnesses wich are less infectious then covid.</p>
<p>But again masks alone are almost worthless if they are not combined with other measures like washing hands and social distancing.
Also these other measures were almost worthless if there were no masks. </p>
<p>Also it makes no sense at all to fear a mask.
A mask cannot hurt me, but it can prevent face recognition.
It's a simple basic measure which is used for decades by surgeons to prevent unnecessary infections.
These Surgeons are also washing there hands and wearing masks for hours.
Also a surveillance state would never recommend face masks if there is an other option.</p>

        <p>&rt;it's obvious that the flu is rare these days because restrictions are working.</p>
<p>In the UK it's supposedly zero this year. This is obvious baloney. </p>
<p>Distancing is harmful and dystopian and goes completely against all human nature and common sense. You can't live a normal life doing that and constantly being worried about people thinking you're too close to them. Plus, it is also a bunch of medieval quackery. Respiratory viruses can travel over 20 feet when someone coughs or sneezes. The virus doesn't magically stop at the six feet. Plus, simply having no symptoms and breathing within a couple of feet of someome is highly unlikely to transmit the virus. Respiratory viruses are transmitted primarily by prolonged contact in small spaces...this is why people in your household are the most likely way for a virus like this to transmit. And asymptomatic spread is virtually non-existent...they just don't have enough viral load to make someone else sick.</p>
<p>Hand washing is the only thing that actually makes sense to reduce the spread of any pathogen. The only measure they've advocated for this respiratory virus that isn't medieval quackery. Hand washing is good as long as it isn't obsessive and excessive.</p>
<p>&rt; A mask cannot hurt me, but it can prevent face recognition.</p>
<p>Hate to break it to you, but personnel recognition software <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/new-facial-recognition-technology-can-accurately-identify-travelers-wearing-masks-96-of-the-time-according-to-a-test-run-by-the-department-of-homeland-security/ar-BB1cwTjN">doesn't care</a> about masks. </p>
<p>&rt;used for decades by surgeons to prevent unnecessary infections.</p>
<p>Correct, hey've been used by surgeons for a long time. But surgeons don't use them to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses. It's actually so they don't get bacteria-laden saliva in the patient's deep open wound, which would cause a horrible infection. Masks are also used for the reason to protect the surgeons's face from sprays and splashes from the patient.</p>
<p>If you want to know why I don't use masks.</p>
<p>There's actually been countless studies done prior to March 2020 (even from the CDC and WHO) that showed masks did very little or downright nothing in slowing the transmission of respiratory viruses. It was also known that the small areas they showed any sort of effectiveness was when worn by people who were actually sick and symptomatic, though the level of effectiveness was not highly significant. A few biased studies in favor of masks does not change decades of data. If you look at real life data we now have (mask mandates everywhere during outbreaks) you'll see that cases were surging for months, which just proves that the initital data on masks being inefficient is correct. </p>
<p>There's also downsides in mass mask usage. In one year billions of masks ended up in the ocean, greatly adding to our pollution problem we've been trying to fix the past few decades. Surely, you care about the environment and animal life. It's basically the vital point in how our future will be shaped if we don't take care of it. Many children (especially those in daycare) are also being robbed from seeing faces. This is hindering their speech and social development. </p>
<p>I also find masks demoralizing &amp; dehumanizing. And not to mention, most are manufactured in cramped, dirty sweatshops in countries like Bangladesh. So no, I won't wear them. You are free to do so though.</p>
