    <strong>Now that you’ve had time to see how all the states responded to the ‘pandemic’, which state would you be most drawn to live in?</strong>
    <p><p>The question is ‘live in’, so would have to be a place you’d want to stay longterm. 
Ron DeSantis is a sensational governor, response to this plandemic was top notch. The state is booming as a result. But can you be as confident in who the next Gov of FL will be? After all, Ron only narrowly defeated Andrew Gillum, can you imagine how bad the state would have been through this with Gillum in office?</p>
<p>Texas seems like a natural winner, with the capacity to stay on the right side of history.</p>
<p>Arizona, Doug Ducey isn’t my favorite, and there’s no telling who the next gov will be. Could be great, could be terrible. If I had a crystal ball this state could win, but seems risky.</p>
<p>Tennessee, state had solid policy of remaining open and without mask mandates. No reason to worry about its prospects longterm. Fastest growing state this year for the first time.</p>
<p>Idaho, has done some funky stuff, they were one of the states that banned HCQ at first.</p>
<p>South Dakota, brilliant response, probably the best. I wouldn’t blame anyone for choosing it. </p>
<p>Curious to hear your opinions, and if anyone has any direct feedback from having lived through it in a state of interest that would be particularly interesting to hear from your experience.</p></p>

        <p>I'm in Ontario - ANY State is looking good compared to here right now.  Even the most left-leaning states are lightening years ahead of us in Ontario.</p>
<p>That being said, I'd go with Texas or Florida if I could!</p>

        <p>My family and I live in ND. On the western side of the state was pretty normal, only by comparison, to most of the other states. Gov Burgum is a friend of Bill Gates and he hosted his weekly presser and worked hard to keep hysteria high, even breaking into tears on occasion. He was up for re-election last fall, and within a week of winning he instituted a mask mandate. In the western part of the state it was largely ignored. We spend a lot of time in SD throughout the year and love it. The black hills are amazing and the people are great. There was so little mask wearing in the city and small towns. It was very normal throughout the last year. I don’t care for the hot weather so SD is my pick of the list.</p>

        <p>Iowa and South Dakota. Florida is  overrated, TBH. DeSantis kept bars closed for quite awhile, although he's done a great job in the national media covering that fact up.</p>
