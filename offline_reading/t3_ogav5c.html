    <strong>Why I will never take another vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>So a while ago I worked in the hospital as a house keeper. A job that is overlooked way too much so shout out to the true hero’s of the hospital who deal with poo, blood and puke on the daily to keep your room clean so the nurses can do thier job properly. </p>
<p>And before I get further allow me to explain myself a bit; when I was a baby, I had a bad reaction to my boosters, leaving me with hives and a very high fever. The hives even left a scar on my neck that looks like a love bite from Dracula. Since then I’ve been super careful about vaccines, avoiding them like the plague in case I’m allergic to something. </p>
<p>This was long before the planned-Demic hit, when the hip vaccine was the flu vaccine. And when the time came, the vaccine was required and my boss told me I could either wear a mask, get written up, or take the medicine. </p>
<p>Now our uniforms were black canvas, so they were very hot to wear. I wasn’t about to add to my discomfort by wearing a hot mask along with a hot uniform. So, I took the poke. </p>
<p>Not three days later I was sick. I was dizzy and could barely stand. I called my boss to try and get some time to recover, but he demanded I come in for work. I needed the money so I went in, hoping I’d feel better by lunch. </p>
<p>Nope. By 10 that morning I was passing out in the halls. The nurses had pulled me aside to an empty room and called my boss to tell him I need to go home. He came to see my sorry self sitting in an empty room with a fever and dizzy, and you know what he said?</p>
<p>“You can wear a mask, or go home and get written up.”</p>
<p>I was done at that point, so I opted to go home. Called my mom to drive me, and I slept the rest of the day. So I’ll never work in a hospital ever again as they don’t care about thier employees. And that’s why I won’t take a vaccine even if you paid me.</p></p>

        <p>About 10 years ago, I was working in a hospital and they started mandating flu shots. I could either get the shot, or wear a fucking mask all day. I didn't even work around patients, but it was still mandated, so I said fuck it and got the shot.</p>
<p>I got the flu 3 days later, first time I had the flu in at least 15 years.</p>
<p>A year later, I got the annual flu shot again. And AGAIN I got the flu a few days later.</p>
<p>The third time around, I told the nurse who was giving me the shot that I got the flu two years in a row after getting the shot. She literally chuckled at me, really condescending, and said "that's impossible" then started explaining realllly slowwwllyy like I was a fucking 3 year old how there's NO connection between me getting the shot and getting the flu. She said I must have just gotten the flu because I worked at a hospital, even though I worked there for 4-5 years without ever getting the flu UNTIL I got the shot.</p>
<p>I don't give a fuck what anybody says. That fucking flu shot gave me the flu, or somehow caused me to be more susceptible or something. I know my body. I'm not a hypochondriac. And I don't like being treated like an idiot.</p>
<p>I don't work there anymore and like you, I will never willingly take a vaccine for anything as long as I live.</p>

        <p>My mom had a friend who got a required flu shot to work at a hospital. She got full body paralysis and was dead within a few weeks of the shot. Perfectly healthy before getting it. Nobody ever confirmed what caused her death, but my mom fully believes the flu shot caused it. I do too</p>

        <p>Same thing happened to a coworker 10-15 yrs ago.
He was fine, the company offered flu shots, he got one, few weeks later---no coworker.</p>

        <p>Are you sure it was actually live flu you got, and not immune inflammation from the vaccine? Because the symptoms can look almost identical, especially body pain, fever, tiredness etc.</p>
<p>Lots of symptoms from flu and similar diseases are not from the virus but the immune processes that attack the virus.</p>

        <p>I was in bed for 24 hours, full body aches, fever, could barely stand up for more than 30 seconds. Then another 24 hours of fatigue and generally feeling shitty. Mostly fine by day 3.</p>
<p>I have no idea of what the actual biological process  was, but it felt and looked 100% like the flu.</p>
<p>By the way, when I got the 3rd flu shot, I got sick about 2 weeks later, felt like a mild flu but could have been unrelated, who knows.</p>

        <p>It's just semantics when they can't tell you the difference between experiencing the flu vs experiencing a reaction to the flu vaccine. Imagine insurance telling you to wreck your car in order to stop you from getting into a wreck.</p>

        <p>I could definitely have been immune inflammation. </p>
<p>It's just the likleyhood of you coming into contact with a flu strain that infects you in that specific time frame several times is statistically unlikley, and most flu shots dont contain any live virus, so that makes immune system inflammation from the vaccine ingredients the most likely cause of you feeling sick.</p>
<p>I had similar symptoms along with a bunch of others when I had my vaccine reaction, but it was bad enough for hospitalization and I never recovered 100%.</p>

        <p>I worked maintenance in a nursing home.  The situation was the same. D.O.N. came to me demanding that I take the flu shot.  I resisted. She threatened my job I flat out told her 
"This building has run for the last 5 years without a maintenance dept. If you would like to make that another 5 that's fine by me, you can either leave me alone or find another"  she took it to the administrator and got written up herself because in case you weren't aware there's an option to opt out of it that she never presented me.  I kept my job. D.O.N. hated me till the day I left.</p>
