        <p>I saw a group of friends yesterday for the first time in a long while, anyway, one friend told me; while he knows many people who are fully vaccinated now, his aunt (70s full vaxxed) recently got Corona and is now on a ventilator! I thought they didn’t use ventilators anymore. He did say she was getting better.</p>

        <p>Maybe take a look at some of the many studies that have been conducted to ascertain that number? Perhaps the phase 3 clinical trials, the CDC's study of frontline healthcare workers, or the Israeli study (to name a few)?</p>

        <p>1% is a large number when we're talking about death. In America that would be 3,000,000 people. </p>
<p>And of course you're ignoring any long term effects it would have, as well as the additional deaths that would result from our healthcare system being overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Not that you'll listen to any of what I'm saying though. Seems no one here can do anything but repeat the reheared talking points.</p>

        <p>If you want to talk about long term effects let’s start with the experimental vaccine. Oh but you guys don’t listen to that right. </p>
<p>Right 1% of deaths due to covid, how many deaths due to lockdowns? Suicides, ODs, not getting medical treatment for other illnesses, not to mention lives being ruined in other ways. People not getting proper exercise or access to education. 
But you idiots only care about saving “one life” that was likely at death’s door already.</p>

        <p>You're overreacting. No one is being refused medical treatment due to lockdowns. In fact, things were far worse in NYC last April when hospitals had to turn patients away because they were at capacity...</p>
<p>Ditto with exercise. You can go outdoors. Take a jog if you want. You're not a prisoner. </p>
<p>There's also no evidence to suggest that nation wide OD's or suicides were anywhere as significant factor in excess mortality as covid was last year. In fact, a minute of research would tell you suicides were <em>down</em> in 2020. </p>
<p>Education I'll admit is unfortunate. But I'm sure you are against masks and social distancing in schools (the only safe way to keep them open).</p>
<p>&rt; If you want to talk about long term effects let’s start with the experimental vaccine.</p>
<p>There's no evidence of long term effects from the vaccine (remember, trials began nearly a year ago) compared to mounting evidence of long term effects from covid. Hmm, wonder which I should chose?</p>
