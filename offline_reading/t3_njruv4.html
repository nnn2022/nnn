    <strong>Curious Doomer</strong>
    <p><p>So, as a "Doomer", I see all the people in here, and I don't agree with a lot of the points you make, but I get where you're coming from. But it does lead me to have to ask a lot of questions.</p>
<p>A lot of people in here don't want to get vaccinated because the vaccines are new mRNA vaccines. These are, as many people pointed out, not "approved" but rather "Authorized for Emergency Use" by the FDA. This is largely because they are a new <em>kind</em> of vaccine, not just a vaccine for a new virus. When companies start releasing the more normal, older style of vaccine, the kind with dead or attenuated strains of the virus, would you guys consider getting those vaccines? I've seen a few people in here point out that they're not anti-vax, just anti-this-vax, so would you still get other kinds of vaccines? Would you be willing to expose yourself to someone who has tested positive to "get it over with", since many people here think that as long as you're healthy, it'll just be a mild cold at worst? I do want to be clear, I get it if you'd rather try not to get sick if you can help it, and just think the response to the pandemic is over the top, I'm just looking for input as to how serious everyone here actually thinks the pandemic is, and if there are people who are open to trying to solve the pandemic.</p>
<p>How many people actually paid attention to things like epidemics and disease before the pandemic? I know I wasn't really interested in it, and now that the pandemic is <em>such</em> a big part of everyone's life, it's kind of hard to ignore. How many people here are healthcare workers, or studied biology or medicine in school, or even just did more than passively watch news channels that may have covered related topics?</p>
<p>What's the big deal with masks? Everyone here seems to think that masks are going to kill everyone, and I genuinely can't tell if it's just an exaggeration, or if you guys really think wearing a mask is dangerous. My sister and I both have Asthma, and neither of us have ever had issue, and I'm sure there are plenty of doctors and healthcare workers that regularly have to wear masks that may have respiratory issues themselves, and it's never been an issue until now. I know a lot of people are bummed about not getting to see people's faces anymore, which I can't relate to, because I am a pretty anti-social person. Is it really that bad to have to wear masks? I've seen people in other subs (especially TwoXChromosomes) talk about maybe continuing to wear masks after the pandemic is over because they like certain aspects of it (a lot of women feel they get harassed less while wearing masks, for example). How do you feel about people wearing masks for non-health related reasons?</p>
<p>Why do people think the vaccine is going to cause long-term harm to people? Most people seem fine with the idea that the virus itself hits you, does its thing, your body gets rid of it, and that's that. The vaccine, however, people seem to think that in a year or two, or maybe even longer down the line, people are going to start getting sick or dying from the side-effects of the vaccine? What about the vaccine is so different that people are more afraid of it than the virus itself? I'm not talking about the VAERS stuff, or immediate side-effects, I'm specifically talking the idea that in a few years, all the vaccinated people are going to rue the day they got vaccinated. Where does <em>THAT</em> idea come from?</p>
<p>Would you guys care to hear about what it's like to get the vaccine? I just got my first dose on Thursday, and, because of how horrible Canada's rollout is, I won't be getting my second one until September, but would that be something people here care about, or am I just going to get a "shut up, doomer" kind of response? </p>
<p>I'm assuming I'm going to get downvoted for this post. Most people who don't agree with the "No New Normal" narrative do, but I am a curious person by nature, and I do have to ask these questions. Please also note I am not a medical expert, nor do I have any power to enact any changes based on how people answer these questions, they're really just to satisfy personal curiosity.</p></p>

        <p>In answer to your first set of questions, I wouldn’t automatically take the vax even if it was formulated the old way—it’s still not enough time for good research to have been done, and after the Cutter polio vaccine incident in the 1950s (and similar, more recent incidents in India), I am very wary of taking any medication that hasn’t been sufficiently tested for safety and efficacy. And yes, if I had to expose myself to COVID (I’d rather not have the vaccine OR the virus, since I hate being sick), I’d rather do it via the virus itself. No, it wouldn’t likely be a mild cold—it’s about the same as the flu—but that sure beats a largely untested vaccine.</p>
<p>I kind of followed Ebola, but at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if you’re an “expert” or not, so long as you have quality information to back you up.</p>
<p>Nobody here thinks masks are going to kill anyone, but they just aren’t effective at preventing illness, and they’re a psychological symbol telling people to be afraid. It’s the principle of it.</p>
<p>Here is what I have said elsewhere in this sub about this:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots">the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women</a> strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy. </p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection against coronavirus”</a></p>

        <p>&rt;Cutter polio vaccine incident</p>
<p>From a brief look into it, the Cutter Polio Vaccine Incident was an issue of using the "live" virus, and just failing to attenuate it. That wouldn't even be an issue with the mRNA vaccine, so it's not really relevant to bring up here, other than to just say "things <em>can</em> go wrong". Sure, but not that way anymore? It's also been almost 70 years since then, and we've been vaccinating people for other stuff for a long time. What about Covid specifically makes you think we'd mess it up again? I'm not sure what issues in India you're referring to, and unfortunately, searching for "Vaccine issues in India" right now is only going to provide articles about how India's Covid-19 response is going, which, from the brief glance, looks to be about shortages more so than any life-threatening issues with the vaccine itself.</p>
<p>&rt;I kind of followed Ebola, but at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if you’re an “expert” or not, so long as you have quality information to back you up.</p>
<p>This is true, with a caveat. A lot of the problem with this line of thinking is that, it's very hard to tell what "quality information" looks like if you don't know what to compare it to, or what you're even looking at. There have been plenty of people in this sub who have shown a lack of even basic scientific knowledge. Just arbitrarily trusting any source than anyone brings forward is a bad idea. It was something we were actually taught to do in University, one of my professors specifically had us go through peer-reviewed, published journal articles and criticize them. Not every piece of info out there is "quality information".</p>
<p>&rt;The CDC itself admits that only 6% of the 1.8% CFR of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-flawed-study-fuels-erroneous-claims-about-covid-19-death-toll/">they have changed the way they report deaths</a></p>
<p>So, from what I understand, <a href="https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/overview/">Covid-19 is associated with several of the comorbidities</a> that cause people to die. ARDS and Pneumonia both tend to be associated with getting Covid, and if one of those two things kill you, it's because you caught Covid. Look at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">this chart</a> that shows the comorbidities associated with Covid. Covid doesn't cause, for example, obesity or Diabetes, but neither of those things kill you by themselves (unless you're not being treated for your diabetes). If you weren't going to die from either of those things, and then you get Covid, and die from diabetes, what is, functionally, the difference between dying from Covid while having diabetes, and dying from diabetes while having Covid? It's a very skewed way to look at the issue.</p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a></p>
<p>This essay is actually a pretty bad take. Many of the points are just anti-vaxx in general, they aren't relevant to the current discussion, a lot of it is US-centric, completely ignoring that other countries are also dealing with Covid, and just full of all kinds of misinformation. I'm not nearly equipped well enough to tackle everything here, and even what I do want to say would probably push me over the character limit. Unfortunately, the list of 32 studies basically plays into exactly what the essay was saying, and, again, way too much material to debate here, nor am I equipped to debate it.</p>
<p>&rt;the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy.</p>
<p>Lots of problems with this argument, and it ties in to how VAERS and similar systems are flawed. All this data is:</p>
<p>A) At pretty major risk of being a Post-hoc fallacy. None of the data presented suggests the vaccine <em>caused</em> those things, just that people got the vaccine, and then also had these symptoms. How do we know it was the vaccine that caused the issue?</p>
<p>B) Not compared to anything. What is the general population typically like, with regards to sudden onsets of these sorts of issues? It would really help to explain how many miscarriages are in the general population, and how many women got the vaccine, instead of just saying "2 miscarriages, 5 miscarriages". What do those numbers mean? Miscarriages happen. Did the vaccine cause them, or are the two unrelated? What % of the population suffers miscarriages, what % of the vaccinated population did? A doctor on Twitter actually pointed out the death rates for Covid-19 vaccines as reported by VAERS was actually <em>lower</em> than the general population, which basically just means there isn't enough data actually being reported to it for us to gain any useful information out of it.</p>
<p>&rt;Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p>Literally all of those links say some variation of, "We don't have a lot of data, the data is of low quality, honestly, we're not sure about a lot of this". Some of it just has really sketchy data to begin with (<a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">comparing 170 surgical mask wearing subjects to 38 cloth mask subjects</a>? And then the result was just, "higher infection in the cloth mask wearers"?) Some of those studies even say surgical masks <em>do</em> help, even if cloth masks don't.</p>

        <p>I brought up the Cutter incident, along with India (I specifically meant the <a href="https://www.scidev.net/asia-pacific/news/oral-polio-drops-linked-to-paralysis-in-india/">recent debacle with the oral polio vaccines</a>), because they’re a prime example of what happens when you release a vaccine before it’s been properly tested.</p>
<p>Yes, I realize people died with comorbidities, where they may have died sooner than they otherwise would. However, the key phrase is “they have changed the way they report deaths” in comparison to other causes of death. The way every other COD is reported is “cause-alone.” This means that if we are trying to compare COVID deaths to any other cause, we have to figure out what the COVID figures would be if we recorded them <em>the same way as every other cause of death</em>. We can’t compare apples to oranges if we want an accurate comparison, and since it’s easier to figure out COVID’s comparable numbers than it is to hunt down every death that “should” be considered, say, a flu death, that is one way to gather a more contextualized picture of COVID’s deaths.</p>
<p>As for the essay, that represents the reasons we aren’t getting the vaccine—not necessarily all the evidence for our reasons, though it does cite a wealth of good evidence. I am confused why you would consider it anti-vax in general—it literally only discusses the COVID vaccine. Being anti-COVID-vax is not the same as being anti-vax in general. Don’t misrepresent information.</p>
<p>If you really are curious about us, you really ought to read that list of studies—that represents simultaneously the history of coronavirus vaccine attempts and the heart of our gripes about this vaccine. Given all the previous failures to create a coronavirus vaccine that doesn’t kill or maim its recipients, as well as the total lack of reassuring data from vaccine manufacturers, I would think it understandable that a large minority of people don’t want that long vaccine.</p>
<p>As for the effect on fertility, it is too soon for an actual study on fertility (it hasn’t even been 9 months since vaccine rollout), so all we have to go on are the numbers we have so far. That is why I use the phrase “strongly suggests,” rather than “proves” or a similarly definitive term. </p>
<p>On the masks, if we can’t even determine from actual scientific studies that the masks are helpful, and we have some indication that they could be harmful, it’s madness to be wearing them. As I said, without evidence in favor of them, it’s purely a psychologically manipulative tool to remind people to be afraid of something no deadlier than the flu.</p>

        <p>&rt;“they have changed the way they report deaths”</p>
<p>Perhaps you missed <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2021/04/scicheck-flawed-study-fuels-erroneous-claims-about-covid-19-death-toll/">the link I posted</a>? I put it in the quote, without drawing attention to it, which was my mistake. To summarize, the CDC didn't <em>change</em> the way COD was reported for Covid, it gave guidelines for how it should be reported, which was <em>in line with normal COD procedures</em>. The report suggesting otherwise was erroneous. </p>
<p>&rt;I am confused why you would consider it anti-vax in general</p>
<p>So, largely that criticism was aimed at the first and second argument in the list. Vaccine manufacturing companies are <em>never</em> liable for side-effects after being approved, so Covid-19 is no different, which the essay notes. Point two is largely the same. The companies that provide Covid-19 vaccines have, in the past, done shady things that got them in trouble, therefore we shouldn't trust the vaccines they're producing now. Except that's likely true of most, if not all vaccine-producing companies (and would also suggest the vaccines those companies have produced in the past are also suspect). The essay makes no distinction between how we look at Covid-19 vaccines, and how we should look at vaccines in general.</p>
<p>&rt;If you really are curious about us, you really ought to read that list of studies</p>
<p>I will, I just don't have the space to debate the validity or relevance of those studies here.</p>
<p>&rt;As for the effect on fertility... all we have to go on are the numbers we have so far.</p>
<p>Right, but my issue was, how do those numbers compare to non-vaccinated people? Surely we have numbers on how many miscarriages people in the general population have, and we can compare such data to the vaccinated-population. Yet there was no such comparison mentioned, and as I pointed out, with VAERS in general, it seems that adverse events are being underreported <em>compared to the general population</em>. Using the numbers of people who got a vaccine and then had a bad thing happen to them is unfair when you're not even comparing it to the average population, you're just saying, "here's a list of numbers of scary things". </p>
<p>&rt;[masks are] purely a psychologically manipulative tool to remind people to be afraid of something no deadlier than the flu.</p>
<p>Why do you think healthcare workers, epidemiologists and the government want you to be afraid of Covid? Why <em>now</em>? What about Covid makes it special that those groups would choose it to start demanding all this change? Why not have a study that shows regular influenza is dangerous (after all, you claim that the Covid-19 numbers are falsely inflated, and that it's no worse than the flu), and we need to lockdown, mask up for that instead? They could have done that at any time, so why Covid-19? Why are masks essential for this narrative?</p>

        <p>If your read the sources I posted, I actually didn’t cite any of the sources your fact-checker claims to have debunked. The 6% figure comes from the CDC’s own data, and the idea that the deaths are inflated (worldwide) is due to those new death codes from the WHO. If you look at the death codes, you’d notice there are codes for “personal history of COVID,” “suspected or probable COVID,” and the very general “confirmed diagnosis of COVID.” What this means is that if you had COVID—or were even suspected of having it—<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd/interim-coding-advice-coronavirus-March-2020-final.pdf">you would be counted as a COVID death</a>, regardless of if you died for completely unrelated reasons. It’s right there on the CDC and WHO websites.</p>
<p>And yes, it is a departure from normal reporting guidelines. Take a look at the ICD-10 for <a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99/J09-J18">influenza</a>. It’s not enough to just have a “possible” case, or even a confirmed one—all the codes listed specifically relate to a complication that caused death.</p>
<p>As I said, the essay represents a list of reasons that, when taken together, build a good case not to get the COVID vaccine. Most people here don’t consider points 1 and 2 to be good enough reasons alone not to get the COVID vaccine, but use the case as a whole.</p>
<p>I am not just citing “numbers of scary things” with regard to negative fertility changes. <a href="https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2020-11/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol_Nov2020.pdf">Pfizer themselves even admit vaccine shedding leading to menstruation disruption is possible</a>, meaning that there’s good reason to believe the vaccine could lead to negative fertility changes.</p>
<p>Healthcare workers don’t want you to be afraid—they’re the “little guys,” so to speak. They’re only following orders. It’s folks like <a href="https://youtu.be/wfstBe1buaA">Bill Gates</a> who want you to be afraid, <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html">so you’ll do what they want without question </a>. What they want is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210430080051/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/">the Great Reset/Net Zero</a>, and they’re using COVID, and its associated vaccine (and soon <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/honor-system-paper-cards-wont-cut-it-for-covid-vaccine-verification-experts-say-vaccine-passports-are-coming/ar-BB1gLkpG">vaccine passports</a>, to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">Here</a> is a great informational video on the topic, with plenty of mainstream articles as evidence. It’s a bit lengthy, but the presenter talks pretty slowly, so you can probably watch it on 2x speed.</p>

<p>For a pneumonia case confirmed as due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), assign codes <a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/J00-J99/J09-J18/J12-/J12.89">J12.89</a>, Other</p>
<p>viral pneumonia, and <a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/A00-B99/B95-B97/B97-/B97.29">B97.29</a></p>
<p>To explain what's happening here, J12.89 is one of the normal Pneumonia classifications. J12 is one of the listings for Pneumonia <em>in the Influenza page you linked</em>. The J12.89 designation is cited as "Other viral pneumonia" B97.29 lists it as being a Pneumonia caused by Coronavirus. Which is not unusual. Again, going back to the influenza page you linked, we can see that referring to the causative agent of the pneumonia is not abnormal. J13 is listed as Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. </p>
<p>&rt;The purpose of this document is to provide official diagnosis coding guidance for health care encounters and deaths</p>
<p>An important thing to note here, as well, is that this is the guideline for <em>any Covid-19 encounter,</em> not just Covid-19 encounters that lead to death. </p>
<p>&rt;The ICD-10-CM codes provided in this document are intended to provide information on the coding of</p>
<p>encounters related to coronavirus. Other codes for conditions unrelated to coronavirus may be required to</p>
<p>fully code these scenarios in accordance with the ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting</p>
<p>This isn't some nefarious plot, this is just how coding illness works. The fact that Influenza has its own specific list doesn't prove that Covid-19's specific list is somehow warped and wrong. You just misunderstood what you were reading. The Influenza page doesn't even mention that it must result in death, these are just the codes to use when someone has Influenza or Pneumonia. Again, one of which <em>is</em> the code used in the Covid-19 document you linked. </p>
<p>&rt;I am not just citing “numbers of scary things” with regard to negative fertility changes. Pfizer themselves even admit vaccine shedding leading to menstruation disruption is possible, meaning that there’s good reason to believe the vaccine could lead to negative fertility changes.</p>
<p>Okay, this Pfizer document is their <em>proposal</em> for human trials. As in, this is the document they wrote <em>before</em> they actually tested anything. Anything is possible, that was what the trials are for. What relevance does them stating that something <em>is possible</em> have for what the actual outcomes are? Where is the actual data the trials provided? Where is the actual evidence that women are at risk? All we have are reported events post-vaccination, which, again, has no comparison to general population data, and also, has no concrete evidence that it's actually related to the vaccine outside of the fact that they happened after the vaccine. </p>
<p>&rt;What they want is the Great Reset/Net Zero, and they’re using COVID, and its associated vaccine (and soon vaccine passports, to get there.</p>
<p>No, stop. This is conspiracy. I don't care what you personally think about Bill Gates and the "New World Order" and the "Great Reset". I also don't care what some YouTuber thinks about them. If that's where this conversation is going to go, there's no point in continuing it.</p>

        <p>Obviously, you can refer to the cause of the pneumonia. But that doesn’t explain the other death codes for <em>possible</em> COVID and the fact that if you were a confirmed case (even if you didn’t die of anything related to COVID), you will be recorded as a COVID death, according to their own system.</p>
<p>I won’t argue the fertility point any further other than to say that in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">clinical trials</a>, this was not recorded, and those trials have a gaping hole in them. That hole is the fact that they didn’t systematically expose all participants to COVID to check for effectiveness, so essentially, they didn’t do anything at all except inject people with an untested drug and tell them to go have a nice life, then wait for them to maybe possibly encounter COVID in the wild. Because they didn’t truly test the safety and efficacy—including the effects on fertility, among other things—of the vaccine, that leaves all the public as unwilling test subjects.</p>
<p>I did not link you what “some youtuber” thinks about the vaccine. He is an actual reporter, but as I said earlier (and you agreed), it doesn’t matter who you are so long as you have good information—and this guy does have proof. I know the knee-jerk reaction to this is to scream “conspiracy theory” and run away, but sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. And if you truly think it’s just a conspiracy theory, you have nothing to lose by looking into it. I don’t see how you could call it that, though, given that the other things I cited on the topic are a TED talk, a well-respected psychological study showing how fear alters human behavior with respect to obedience, and an essay from the WEF—all good, respectable sources. And the reporter in the video cites the same kinds of sources. I strongly encourage you to watch the video before making any judgment on this. It’s best to understand what the “other side” says on an issue before making up your mind.</p>

        <p>&rt;But that doesn’t explain the other death codes for possible COVID and the fact that if you were a confirmed case (even if you didn’t die of anything related to COVID), you will be recorded as a COVID death, according to their own system.</p>
<p>The guidelines don't say this. They're codes used to refer to any illness, even ones that don't end in deaths. This isn't specifically codes to use on death certificates. These are general codes. Furthermore, which codes are you referring to, that refer to "<em>possible</em> COVID"? </p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/Z00-Z99/Z00-Z13/Z03-/Z03.818">Z03.818</a>, Encounter for observation for suspected exposure to other biological agents ruled out.</p>
<p>This is a general code, that has <em>nothing</em> to do with COVID, and was just the recommended code the guideline said to use <em>under the event that the code is relevant to the patient.</em> There's no mention of COVID on the ICD page, it's just what doctors are supposed to code a patient as if they've been exposed to an infectious disease (which COVID is), and were tested <em>negative</em> for it, which means they wouldn't be listed as a COVID death, even if they did die, because they tested negative for it!</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/Z00-Z99/Z20-Z29/Z20-/Z20.828">Z20.828</a>, Contact with and (suspected) exposure to other viral communicable</p>
<p>diseases.</p>
<p><em>Another</em> general code that has nothing to do with COVID, and was recommended to be used in cases where it's use is appropriate, when patients came into contact with someone with a viral communicable disease (which COVID is), with possible exposure.</p>
<p>Did you actually read the guidelines, <em>OR</em> the ICD? If so, did you even bother to check to see what the codes were before just assuming these are "NEW NEVER BEFORE USED CODES MADE UP TO INFLATE COVID DEATH NUMBERS"? Most of the codes either already existed, or were new because they referred to specific illnesses caused by COVID, not "all these are being attributed to COVID for no reason, and that's what goes on the Death Certificate for no reason". Z20.828 is specifically listed on the ICD as</p>
<p>&rt; Z20.828 is a billable/specific ICD-10-CM code that can be used to indicate a diagnosis for reimbursement purposes.</p>
<p>Do you see anywhere that says it's a death-certificate code?</p>
<p>&rt;Approximate Synonyms</p>
<p>Exposure to ebola virus</p>
<p>Exposure to ebola virus disease</p>
<p>Exposure to h1n1 influenza virus</p>
<p>Exposure to influenza</p>
<p>Exposure to influenza a virus subtype h1n1</p>

<p>Exposure to viral meningitis</p>
<p>Exposure to viral meningitis (brain inflammation)</p>
<p>Exposure to zika virus</p>
<p>This list, all of the things Z20.828 refers to, don't list COVID at all, and list A BUNCH OF OTHER DISEASES. Including Influenza, which you incorrectly stated had to have confirmation earlier, yet here it is, in the list of things that fall under the COVID code that only has to have confirmed contact. </p>
<p>At this point, I'm convinced you either don't actually read any of the material you send me, or else don't actually understand what you're reading. I shouldn't have to walk you through it this carefully. It's fine if you are ignorant on some subjects, everyone is. It's just a part of living in our massive world, you <em>can't</em> know everything. But you need to at least do the work before you present proof. You can't just go, "Look, the CDC is evil now" with a document that shows <em>nothing has changed</em>, then post their old work and say, "Look how different this is" when it's almost exactly the same, sometimes literally exactly the same. I appreciate you sending me the sources you did, but I can't appreciate any of the arguments you pose with them, because after having looked into the sources, I just can't believe you actually read through the sources, understood them, and still came back with those arguments. I'm sorry, because this will certainly come off rude or condescending, but <strong>do better.</strong> You're basically spreading misinformation because you don't understand what you're saying, and you're backing it up with intimidating-looking proofs that <em>don't say what you say they do</em>. Look more deeply into your sources, try to understand what they're actually saying, then ask someone who might know what they say when you get stuck. Ask questions about the material anyway, even if you think you <em>do</em> understand them.</p>

        <p>I did read those sources. Right in the the original link to the WHO, it says that they are talking about death codes. Perhaps you missed that one.</p>
<p>Yes, I know there is guidance for codes on exposure to other respiratory diseases, but again, <em>that doesn’t change the fact that they’re reporting anyone who even may have died with COVID in their system as a COVID deaths, according to the WHO’s own guidance</em>. They don’t record somebody as a flu death on the basis that they had flu-like symptoms, or even tested positive for the flu, if the flu didn’t contribute to their demise.</p>
<p>My sources most certainly do say what I think they do. There are new death codes. They do cover cases where COVID was even <em>suspected</em>.</p>
<p>I doubt it’ll change your mind at this point, but <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">vaccine breakthrough cases only count if they return positive with RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>, whereas <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">standard COVID tests have RT-PCR Ct value cutoff at 35-40</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits any RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40 produces a useless result, and that 40-90% positive COVID tests shouldn’t be positive</a>. That means that COVID case numbers are being artificially inflated, and that death numbers, by that metric alone, are almost certainly inflated as well by misdiagnosed patients with other illnesses.</p>

        <p>&rt;Literally all of those links say some variation of, "We don't have a lot of data, the data is of low quality, honestly, we're not sure about a lot of this". Some of it just has really sketchy data to begin with (comparing 170 surgical mask wearing subjects to 38 cloth mask subjects? And then the result was just, "higher infection in the cloth mask wearers"?) Some of those studies even say surgical masks do help, even if cloth masks don't.</p>
<p>We have the data of an entire year in many different countries. Regardless of mask efficacy, mask mandates have absolutely zero correlation with cases/deaths.          </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.covidchartsquiz.com/masks">quiz</a> shows that it's impossible to associate mandates with their expected result.          </p>
<p>And even if they were seen to work under ideal circumstances (which is very unlikely with a virus that literally lingers in the air), it's still proven that mandating them onto the general population isn't at all effective, so the finding would be moot.</p>

        <p>I am impressed that you were able to be so civilised in your post! You won't get DVed and banned because the NNN people are those who never ban dissenting voices - that is the sole response of the pro-NN lobby. We are tolerant whilst they are intolerant.</p>
<p>&rt;I've seen a few people in here point out that they're not anti-vax, just anti-this-vax, so would you still get other kinds of vaccines?</p>
<p>I am one of the rare 100% anti-vaxxers on the sub but know that everyone else is OK with vaxxes that went through the regular 10-20 years' worth of research and have been in use for decades.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;When companies start releasing the more normal, older style of vaccine, the kind with dead or attenuated strains of the virus, would you guys consider getting those vaccines? <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Why do people think the vaccine is going to cause long-term harm to people? Most people seem fine with the idea that the virus itself hits you, does its thing, your body gets rid of it, and that's that. The vaccine, however, people seem to think that in a year or two, or maybe even longer down the line, people are going to start getting sick or dying from the side-effects of the vaccine? What about the vaccine is so different that people are more afraid of it than the virus itself? I'm not talking about the VAERS stuff, or immediate side-effects, I'm specifically talking the idea that in a few years, all the vaccinated people are going to rue the day they got vaccinated. Where does THAT idea come from?</p>
<p>Who'd get a coronavirus vaxx knowing this? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/n0z73c/dont_be_a_ferret_decades_worth_of_research_has/">https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/n0z73c/dont_be_a_ferret_decades_worth_of_research_has/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Would you be willing to expose yourself to someone who has tested positive to "get it over with", since many people here think that as long as you're healthy, it'll just be a mild cold at worst?</p>
<p>I live in Europe, have never worn a mask and we're 18 months into a super-contagious and  DeAdLy PaNdEmIc. I never get common colds and flus and would have noticed a change in my health if I had been infected by the new airborne Ebola virus.  </p>
<p>&rt;I'm just looking for input as to how serious everyone here actually thinks the pandemic is, and if there are people who are open to trying to solve the pandemic.</p>
<p>You can't stop a respiratory virus and the PaNdEmIc is clearly not deadly if some US states have to resort to clever accounting - ie, any dead for any reason within 60 days of a positive PCR test that has a cycle threshold that ranges from 35-50 - and mass propaganda to convince people of the disease. Then there's the flip-flopping! How have you not developed severe brain trauma from the whiplash?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;How many people actually paid attention to things like epidemics and disease before the pandemic? I know I wasn't really interested in it, and now that the pandemic is such a big part of everyone's life, it's kind of hard to ignore. How many people here are healthcare workers, or studied biology or medicine in school, or even just did more than passively watch news channels that may have covered related topics?</p>
<p>I dropped out of med school when I realised that modern medicine is just the sales arm of BigPharma. Yes, I have followed pandemics and health since I was traumatised as a child in Singapore during SARS.  </p>
<p>&rt;What's the big deal with masks?</p>
<p>They don't work and scientists who were alive during the Spanish Flu of 1918 wrote about this in 1919 and 1920. Simply put, we have known since 1919 that masks do NOT work for respiratory infections and claiming that the ExPeRtZ forgot this until April 2020 is utter nonsense.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Would you guys care to hear about what it's like to get the vaccine? I just got my first dose on Thursday, and, because of how horrible Canada's rollout is, I won't be getting my second one until September, but would that be something people here care about, or am I just going to get a "shut up, doomer" kind of response?</p>
<p>If you want to be vaxxed, you are free to do so! No-one here is forcing you not to get vaxxed. We have an issue with those who mock us for not wanting to get vaxxed and those who entertain the tyrannical idea that masks, vaxxes and vaxx passports should be mandatory.</p>

        <p>Thanks for asking these questions! I think it’s really important we can ask and hear others opinions on things we disagree on (not just in this situation but about everything) so feel free to respond to anything you disagree with me on too! </p>
<p>I studied biology at university and have a career in a biological field, though not in a medical one.</p>
<p>My personal views are that I do not want to take the vaccine because of:
1. Animal testing and lining the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry.
2. I have had COVID and it was very mild so I have the memory cells and what purpose would it serve?
3. I got COVID early on and so was at work with it before I realised and not a single other person caught it as I was not coughing or sneezing much.
4. I don’t respond well to governmental/ societical coercion and manipulation to get the vaccine.
5. Many researchers and doctors have warned of potential side effects so why would I, a healthy person not at risk of complications take the chance?
6. I believe my immune system can respond better to a natural virus then it will to an artificial vaccine.
7. I don’t believe Pharmaceutical companies want the best for our health at all. They are profit driven. Watch the documentary ‘What the Heath’ on Netflix for an intro on how health organisations, and the medical industry conspire to keep us dependent on pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Here are two scientific papers outlining possible problems with the vaccine. Why is there no discussion about this at all in the mainstream media?</p>
<p>https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/banned-paper-doctors-risk-versus-benefit-assessment-of-covid-jabs</p>
<p>https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/23/34</p>
<p>Of course I am open to solving the pandemic. I think a better and more healthy way than coercing mass vaccination on people who don’t want it would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anyone who wants to take the vaccine can now get it, which means most of the vulnerable and elderly who are most at risk can feel they are protected.</li>
<li>Lockdowns here in the UK were touted as a way to ‘flatten the curve’ and ‘Save the NHS’ which now the most vulnerable are vaccinated shouldn’t be an issue anymore.</li>
<li>Promote healthy lifestyle such as diet, exercise, reduction of stress levels (turn of the news!!!) and social interaction. Exactly the opposite of what had been promoted throughout this pandemic.</li>
<li>As a collective we need to get comfortable or at least accepting of the idea of death. We don’t have a right to eternal life or extending our lives at any cost. We are all going to die at some point and there is no point being too greedy about it. Let us enjoy life and our loved ones to the max while we are all still here and make it a priority to stay healthy and put quality of life over quantity. Yes there will still be people who sadly pass away, but realise that this is ok and normal and natural. There is no point clinging and grasping to life as we all have our time to go and it will come when it comes. We will always remember our loved ones who passed but we need to also remember that it’s normal for them to die at some point. Not every one gets old and that is sad but it’s a fact and if you have reached old age then you are a lucky one.</li>
</ol>
<p>With regards to masks, yes wear them if you are infectious and have to go out by all means but it is ridiculous wearing them all the time if you are not. Also they have caused a huge environmental pollution problem as they have been littered everywhere. An example of humans putting their own well-being above others. Wildlife has been known to get caught in the elastic and they degrade to micro plastics. Also if the virus is so deadly shouldn’t they be treated as hazardous medical waste and not casually strewn on the street or thrown in the bin?
If people want to wear reusable cloth ones for their own reasons that is their own choice and I have no issues with that whatsoever.</p>
<p>I know not everyone has the same views as me on each of your questions but I hope i have given you insight into your questions from at least one persons point of view.</p>

        <p>&rt;Animal testing and lining the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>Not sure what you mean here? I've seen some people suggest that Animal testing <em>wasn't</em> done, but you've phrased it here like the issue is that it <em>was</em> done. Typically animal testing is required before human trials of medicine go through, so I'm assuming you aren't aware that Covid-19 did have animal testing? And then also human trials? Also, whether you get the vaccine or not, "Big Pharma" has already been paid. The vaccines have all already been paid for. From what I understand, the US is giving out shots for free, and most other countries already have it covered under whatever healthcare the country provides.</p>
<p>&rt;I have had COVID and it was very mild so I have the memory cells and what purpose would it serve?</p>
<p>Have they not shown evidence that you can contract Covid multiple times? As you can with Influenza, and other Cold-type viruses?</p>
<p>&rt;Many researchers and doctors have warned of potential side effects so why would I, a healthy person not at risk of complications take the chance?</p>
<p>All medicine has side effects, and not all of the vaccines are associated with dangerous side effects, it's mostly the AstraZeneca that can potentially cause blood clots. Covid-19 kills people, even healthy, low-risk people. The idea would be to prevent even mild symptoms if you do catch it, and hopefully reduce transmission (although there's still some contention as to how well the vaccines actually do that)</p>
<p>&rt;I believe my immune system can respond better to a natural virus then it will to an artificial vaccine.</p>
<p>The artificial vaccine is just the mRNA from the virus itself, for the most part. What about the vaccine do you think makes it dangerous beyond what the virus is capable of? Are you generally anti-vax, or is there something about this vaccine specifically you don't trust?</p>
<p>&rt;I don’t believe Pharmaceutical companies want the best for our health at all. They are profit driven</p>
<p>So, there obviously has to be a balance struck with businesses like this. You can't let your population get too sick, so they have to have <em>some</em> utility. Since the science field is regulated in most countries, there are plenty of limits as to what they can and can't do. I'm sure the documentary would address some of those issues, but even just basic market forces suggest they have to at least have <em>some</em> efficacy. There's also self-interest involved. Even if I'm a profit-driven big pharma CEO, I'd want the medicine I produce to be able to help <em>me</em> if I get sick, or my family. As we're seeing with Elizabeth Holmes, you can't just make faulty products and hope nobody notices. </p>
<p>&rt;With regards to masks, yes wear them if you are infectious and have to go out by all means but it is ridiculous wearing them all the time if you are not</p>
<p>So, I asked elsewhere, and I know it's been brought up in this sub before, but how do you feel about asymptomatic transmission? </p>
<p>&rt;Also if the virus is so deadly shouldn’t they be treated as hazardous medical waste and not casually strewn on the street or thrown in the bin?</p>
<p>Not particularly. As long as you don't rub the mask into your face, or touch someone else's discarded mask and then touch your face you should be fine. The virus doesn't survive very well outside the body, either. People absolutely should dispose of their masks in a safe and appropriate way, but normal garbage bins are fine.</p>

        <p>You are correct, my issue with the animal testing is that it was most certainly done. I don’t want to extend my life if it means other lives have been tortured and experimented upon to do it. I am against animal testing and I aim to live as natural healthy lifestyle as possible and then when my time is up I will die. I don’t want to take drugs and extend my life by supporting an industry I don’t believe is ethical. </p>
<p>Yes you can catch COVID multiple times, but I don’t mind if I catch it again. Do you know that you can still catch COVID even with having the vaccine? Yes it is supposed to be a milder version but as you say all medicine has side effects and works differently in different bodies, therefore even with the vaccine you could catch COVID and have better or worse symptoms than someone else. If I have COVID again I think it will be mild but even if it isn’t then I will be sick for a while and most likely recover.</p>
<p>You ask me what about the vaccine I thought might be dangerous. Did you read the papers I linked in my previous comment? They outline the potential risks and long term effects in great detail. </p>
<p>I am not anti-vax in general and I do believe they have helped to eradicate diseases, however due to my beliefs on animal testing I do not believe they are ethical products. I realise most people don’t share this value and I am not asking them to as everyone has their own personal moral code but I will fight to have the freedom to live my own life to my values. I am not even anti-vax about this vaccine (barring the vivisection issue). I think if people make a fully informed decision to take this vaccine then they have every right to do so. But don’t you think the information we get is heavily skewed to taking it without a real debate so people are fully informed of the issues? There is a lot of suggestion that people with autoimmune issues could be made worse by taking the vaccines or it could even cause these types of problems where none where there before. Do you think people with autoimmune conditions are being told about all this before they are being jabbed? Are they even asked if they suffer from these conditions? In my experience they aren’t and that is worrying. </p>
<p>You may think having Covid is worse than a worsening of autoimmune disease, but shouldn’t people be given the information to make an informed decision about their own health?</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting drug companies make completely faulty products and they of course do have varying levels of efficacy, but many many drugs that are prescribed come with side effects, to which more more drugs are prescribed, and I believe in many cases this is the actual business model of pharmaceutical companies. Maximise the amount of drugs you can give to every individual and make them dependent. I prefer to take responsibility of my health by living a natural healthy lifestyle. It’s been proven to work time and time again for the great majority of people.</p>
<p>The way I feel about asymptomatic transmission is, if you have the Covid infection but are not displaying symptoms and not coughing all over the place then I feel the chances of spreading it are there, but not that high. Where i have thought it might be a greater risk is people spreading it around from surface to surface by their hands and I do think we should all be washing our hands a lot more and maintaining decent levels of personal and environmental hygiene (without going mad of course).</p>
<p>However you are saying the virus can’t survive well outside of the body so maybe you think spreading by surfaces and hands is not much of an issue?</p>
<p>So while I think there may be a risk of asymptotic transmission, I believe the actual risk level has been severely up-played.</p>

        <p>I don't know how old you are but I have been in the realm for 5 decades now. What I have seen, along with others with a little time under the belt, is that the government is untrustworthy by any and all definitions. We have seen the progression of this agenda our whole lives. Covid didn't just happen. It's just a very large step in yet another pro-death government agenda.</p>
<p>To see all this, one would have to not just look at the Covid agenda during this time but all societal and political agendas that have ridden the coattails of Covid. There is WAY more going on than Covid. In fact, I would say that the TPTB would rank Covid barely in the Top 5 of importance of simultaneous agendas going on right now. The problem with Doomers is that they have been transfixed by the pendulum action of Covid's golden pocket watch so that they won't notice the truly scary things going on right now.</p>
<p>As to all your questions, if you need only "evidence" to advance in life or to make crucial decisions then you will not be successful. Much of life comes to down to intuition not just cognition. Intuitively, I know this is overreach at best and a complete scam, at worst. Either way, I've never participated in the Covid game and have been just fine. Never been tested, never worn a mask and will absolutely NEVER take that shot.</p>

        <p>You don't <em>need</em> the vaccine, but it might be a good idea to get one, even if you're not high-risk for death due to Covid. For starters, if we can get everyone immunized, we might be able to eradicate the virus, which would stop the lockdowns. It would also prevent the possibility of it mutating into variants that are more dangerous, or becoming like Influenza, where you might get it multiple times per year. Even if you would otherwise survive it, the vaccine reduces the rate of transmission, and it reduces symptoms, so you're less likely to end up bedridden or in the hospital if you get vaccinated. Vaccinations aren't just to prevent deaths, they're to prevent illness in general.</p>

<p>I don't care about contracting or spreading covid. You do what you want in order to protect yourself. Covid is a minor risk, something we engage in every day in a free society. Don't like the 95% chance, at worst, to contract and die from covid? Stay home. Don't like the chance you may get hit by lightning? Stay out of the rain. It's that simple.</p>

<p>This isn't an argument. Watch. You don't like the way the government is handling the pandemic? Stay home. Don't like mask mandates? Stay home. Don't like people telling you to get vaccinated? Stay home. Or, you don't like any of those things, move. Same argument, and it's just as bad. It's easy to say, but it doesn't solve anything for anyone. Not everyone <em>can</em> just stay home. It really <em>isn't</em> that simple.</p>
<p>It's not "hubris" to suggest the virus could be eradicated. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox">We've eradicated diseases</a> before. I did say it was overly optimistic, and not likely, but it's not "hubristic". </p>
<p>&rt;I thought those were supposed to end in two weeks so hospitals don't get overloaded. Then once a certain death threshold was met. Then when a case threshold was met. Are you starting to see a pattern?</p>
<p>Yeah, the virus is still around. Real tough pattern to spot. </p>
<p>&rt;How can that happen when people are being infected regardless of mRNA therapy?</p>
<p>It's a vaccine, not therapy. "A therapy or medical treatment (often abbreviated tx, Tx, or Tₓ) is the attempted remediation of a health problem, usually following a medical diagnosis." This would mean that therapies are treatments, after the fact. Vaccines, on the other hand, are preventative, before you get sick. The entire point of the vaccine is to prevent severe symptoms and the spread of the disease, which would mean A) Fewer people actually get "sick" (show symptoms) and B) If the virus mutates while inside of you, you're more likely not to spread it, which means we'll get fewer strains, subtypes and variants in the general public. Which means it's less likely to become like Influenza, and less likely to get worse. If the virus can't spread mutants, it's also less likely to be able to overcome natural/vaccine resistances, so people who have already had Covid-19 or the vaccine won't have to get sick/vaccinated again.</p>

        <p>Seems like they botched the start, and then they reacted too slowly, but once things were locked down, they decided to try to take the opportunity to deal with it as completely as possible. There was (and may still be) a very real chance that we could eradicate Covid-19. I think it'd be naively optimistic to believe we actually will, since <em>so many</em> people do not want to get vaccinated, or deal with masks and social distancing and other preventative measures. I think what's going to end up happening is we're going to have small pockets that get infected periodically, and we're just going to continually have to deal with it until either A) it ends up just like Influenza. Basically fixed in the population, and we just hope only a few people die from it each year, or B) it gets worse, and we <em>have</em> to deal with it more seriously.</p>

        <p>I think Aids from HIV is a scam, mostly because quite a few scientists have debunked it.. people didnt die from HIV tunring to aids, they were given deadly and unapproved drugs by their doctors, which is what turned into Aids, and killed them</p>

        <p>Cool, so go get HIV, then. Two birds with one stone, you can prove that as long as you stay healthy, no disease is fatal, and you can prove that AIDS comes from deadly drugs instead of HIV. Awesome. Best of luck to you. Just remember to warn potential partners that you're doing this experiment, not all of us are invincible.</p>

        <p>Listen, im not saying im right on my viewpoints, I think we all should do and believe in what we want. People are free to make decisions based on what they think is right. If we have to live in a world where we are tightly restricted and governed by a government that tell me they have my health at highest priority, while bombing the middle east back to the fucking stone age. That kind of dyspotian world isnt worth it.. what I do have a problem with, is when you start tramping on my freedom and put my back against the wall, then im done being friendly. And we are approaching that reality at rapid speed.</p>

        <p>Sorry, we must have had a misunderstanding. I'm not forcing you to do anything. If you don't want to get vaccinated, you don't have to, nor will I make you. If you want to believe that every virus is harmless, or close to, as long as you're healthy enough, you're free to believe that. I just think it's dishonest to say you believe something, but not be willing to back up your belief, so I'm encouraging you to do so. If you want to stop being friendly, you're free to do that, too. You don't owe me anything, any more than I owe you anything. If you want to say that HIV is a harmless virus, but not be willing to prove it, that's something you've gotta reconcile with yourself, not me. If you're good, you're good.</p>

        <p>I don't think Covid-19 is a scam. If you do, that's on you. But I'm also neither responsible for what the government does, nor what you do. If the government says wear a mask outside, I will. If the private business I go to says wear a mask, I will. If you don't, that's on you, and you'll have to deal with those consequences on your own. And yeah, we'll all deal with the consequences of Covid-19, and how everyone handled it one way or another.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what making masks illegal would do. Most people who are about to commit a crime would likely simply put the mask on before they committed the crime. This sort of sounds like the same argument as "make owning a gun illegal". Criminals are still going to do it. Even if we somehow prevented them from doing so, they'd likely just find alternative ways to go about it, like wearing big scarves. </p>
<p>There are also some people who have found benefits to wearing masks outside of health or criminal activity. How do you feel about those people?</p>

        <p>You've probably heard the expression: the cure us worse than the disease.</p>
<p>You wrote a lot, but you never seem to feel you needed to justify the danger of covid to then justify the reaction. Would you move homes because someone said they thought they heard a ghost? That's how you seem to me. </p>
<ol>
<li>The method of counting cases and infections has been  changed. Why change the way of determining who had the disease was done differently than ever before. We look to seroprevalence two determine how many people have had a disease, why not this time?</li>
<li>They changed the method of counting deaths. The will count anyone who died with covid, not of it. This is from the counters themself. That would be like counting people who died and had an ambulance take them to the hospital a road victim. </li>
</ol>
<p>Check this out:</p>
<p><a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2021/05/18/a-small-minority-of-montreal-children-have-had-covid-19/">https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2021/05/18/a-small-minority-of-montreal-children-have-had-covid-19/</a></p>
<p>Headline: A small minority of Montreal children have had COVID-19</p>
<p>Sub Headline: Preliminary results of UdeM researcher Kate Zinszer’s EnCORE study suggest nearly 6 per cent of kids in four parts of the city, tested between last October to this April, had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>From article:  By April 2021, in the third wave, 8.9 per cent of the students tested had antibodies. </p>
<p>No one can possibly this stupid. First, antibodies don't last. Most of the previously acquired antibodies will have disappeared. So, the number of students who had covid would be 8.9% + previous waves. There is no possible way to get to 6% and the number is probably between 30 - 40% since not everyone develops antibodies. </p>
<p>Deaths there: well, they tried too say one 18 year-old had died of covid there, but his family went public and said it wasn't due to covid. I don't think they've had another 0 - 19 year old die.</p>
<p>So, with PCR testing, it seems like only 1% of children had covid and 1 died, when in reality 30 - 40% of children had covid and none died. Any basic researcher could show this and yet they still push the vaccine on kids. </p>
<p>You may not require a reason other than, the government said, but other folks do.</p>

<p>First I've seen this. Seems like a strawman. Can you provide a link to someone arguing this?</p>
<p>&rt;if you guys really think wearing a mask is dangerous.</p>
<p>Again, i have not seen much arguing masks are dangerous in general. Can you provide a link to a post here arguing that? Because this seems like another straw man.</p>
<p>&rt;How many people actually paid attention to things like epidemics and disease before the pandemic?</p>
<p>Quite a bit actually. 50-80k a year die of the flu; sometimes lower, sometimes higher. It's much easier to agree with whatever state media tells you; to disagree you generally have to have reasons you strongly believe in. </p>
<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07993.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;Most fundamentally, the groups we studied believe that science is a process, and not an institution...</p>
<p>&rt;Indeed, anti-maskers often reveal themselves to be more sophisticated in their understanding of how scientific knowledge is socially constructed than their ideological adversaries, who espouse naive realism about the “objective” truth of public health data</p>

        <p>Cheers to you for being cordial and actually listening to opinions that may be contrary to your current beliefs.  I got the vax only because I knew it would be a requirement to enjoy life more easily (e.g. Lollapalooza Chicago is vax or a negative test for each day).  After my second shot (Moderna), I started shaking with a very high heart rate about 12 hours afterward.  Previously, I've been around several dozen friends that got COVID and my body seemed un-phased (yay staying healthy with a strong immune system).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am not anti-vax at all, but I have hesitations regarding a rushed mRNA vaccine that skipped a lot of trial steps.  Moreover, for young, healthy individuals the 'risk' is almost non-existent.  Compare this to well-studied traditional vaccines for actually deadly things like the Measles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we didn't have a vaccine, but exposure and "getting it over with" would have allowed me earlier access to freedoms, I may have (sadly) done so as a last resort.  I am confident in my body's ability to fight, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wearing a mask is a pain, but obviously not extremely difficult.  I am glad our gym dropped the mask mandate as cardio with a sweaty rag on your face was nasty.  Moreover, there are NO standards for what type of mask you wear (I have some laughably thin ones that follow the 'face covering' rule, but would stop anything).  Texas has not required masks for a while and hosted indoor events of 70K... no bodies piled in the streets there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have NO IDEA what the vaccine will do in the long-term as it's very new &amp; rushed.  If I were a young woman, especially one that wanted kids, I would be extremely reluctant.  </p>

<p>Bottom line, if you're a 70 year old overweight diabetic, take the vax--the risk profile makes sense.  In Chicago 80% of those 65+ have been vaccinated for like a month now.  If you're healthy, it should completely be your choice.  The vaccinated cannot complain any more (at least here) as they've had their chance.  Let the youth 'take the risk' and live again.</p>

        <p>Hi, thanks for asking questions.</p>
<p>Anyway, with regards to the vaccine, I would consider getting it when we are more aware of the risks - at present, there is the stark contrast between hearing about adverse reactions online, from friends and family friends and friends of friends etc, as well as VAERS reports and all, with the insistence that they are completely safe from general media. I do not know what to think, and currently I am repelled by suspicion (such as the idea of vaccine passports, no manufacturer liability, an amplified distrust for officials after the hypocrisy of the last year and all that) and will at the very least require to see clear evidence of risks before making a risk assessment of whether I want the vaccine with this new information. The thing with long term effects is that we simply don't know, and won't have that information for some time. As I say, I want that information first. I hope people are okay after taking the vaccine but I do feel that in cases of healthy people it may have been a short sighted decision, but honestly not my place to comment on the medical decisions of strangers.</p>
<p>In general, I did not know a lot about pandemics and all but I've learned a lot this year. I did however understand how harmful our response is immediately, and it's only gotten worse over time. I do not think for me I'd have any serious problems dealing with covid, though I wouldn't willingly expose myself because if I do get more than mild cold symptoms I'd rather not have flu symptoms. As for a response to the pandemic, focused protection has always made sense to me. It respects that people have different situations, and risk tolerance. Gives them options, the government can offer levels of protection to vulnerable people and put the money into hospitals and care homes and general high risk environments where it is needed and will make a difference. My description is a bit vague here, but the thing that sticks out to me is of course the avoidance of the vast harm caused by lockdowns.</p>
<p>As for masks, I do not think they are dangerous, just unnecessary. Their effectiveness is largely based on conflicting evidence, with valid scientific points to be made on both sides. The thing that really solidifies this confusion for me is <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">this study</a>, an RCT (our best quality of evidence) with inconclusive results. If our best quality is inconclusive, what are we going on? Couple that with the unclear results of masks in real life (in particular the much mentioned states of Florida and Texas, but there are others too) and I just don't see how we're basing this on clear science. But more importantly, something with unclear effect should not become a policy and good policy making must consider benefits and consequences. If we are not clear on the benefits, how do we know they outweigh the consequences? These are primarily social (the way people have treated each other over the issue has been overall negative) and environmental (primarily ocean plastics, an issue which masks have worsened that we were previously trying to fix), as well as it not really being in line with a society that respects the freedom of choice of its citizens to do something like that if we don't know it is effective. Some people find it hard to wear masks, but whatever the reason is why they don't want to, I feel no one should be forced to, especially given the points I just mentioned.</p>
<p>So thanks for coming and asking, I hope no one pushed you away for genuinely trying to understand.</p>

        <p>Yes. It IS that bad to have to wear masks. They are hard to breathe in, hot, annoying, a constant reminder of all the misery we are in, government overreach and just a bloody misery. Remember that lots of people have health issues (beyond the constant immunocompromised stuff we're always hearing about) and just cannot TAKE another piece of physical discomfort. I have worn a mask literally only for those MINUTES that it's absolutely mandated, not one second longer (never outside). When I hear people say "what's the big deal about masks" - it makes me see red...and also want to throw all the masks in the garbage. Part of the reason for the anger is that people dismiss the problems with them. If there was greater acknowledgement that YES, they are a problem, people would be less angry. But imagine being asked to do something, everyday, that made you MISERABLE, then being told it was "no big deal" and called a baby or worse for objecting. That's why people are pissed. And no, I don't think they work. Especially since there are a lot of "creative" masks roaming around. I had COVID. So yea, I know it's a thing. It sucked, and I'm very sorry for all the people who have died from it. I'm also very sorry for all those people who died from cancer, strokes, suicides and overdoses this year. I'm sorry for all those whose lives were stolen from them by lockdowns. For me, I feel I did my part.  I miserably wore a mask when forced. I had the virus. I'm not doing one more thing. I have whatever antibodies I have and I'm good with that. It's not my job to get a painful, experimental vaccine to protect "others". I don't want it for myself and guess what- no one does anything to protect me from diseases that scare ME. Covid doesn't scare me, so I see no reason I need to protect others from a disease that might scare them. I see you're Canadian, so you have an actual national health service. I will be honest, if the US had a national health service, I MIGHT feel differently. But in America, it's everyone for himself. If I get cancer tomorrow or cancer from this vaccine in ten years, I'm on my own to die. So I'm going to make my own health decisions. I get the vaccines that I feel that I need (not an "anti-vaxxer"). I don't feel the need to get the covid one and am not interested in even mild side effects. I'm done with all of this. I hope I don't sound too harsh- it's just that you seemed genuinely interested in the other side, which I respect, so I wanted to give you a real answer.</p>
