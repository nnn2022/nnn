    <strong>Hear me out. This may be unpopular but needs to said.</strong>
    <p><p>First off, a healthy amount of skepticism is a good thing, and God knows the Government and MSM have proven time and time again that they are not truthful nor have the best intentions when it comes to the population but don't be so skeptical that it hurts you and everyone else in the long run. Yes covid is a real virus, where it came from no one knows without a doubt. Yes covid has an extremely high survival rate, last I read 95% to 99% depending on age and then it drops depending on preexisting conditions. But this REAL virus has the potential to mutate into something extremely deadly. So if you have preexisting conditions or are in ill health please consider taking the vaccine. If anyone close to you has a preexisting condition please consider taking the vaccine. You can't fight against authoritarianism and the "newnormal" if you are dead. Circumstances of when you should consider taking the vaccine are not represented here enough. I myself and loved ones have all the vaccinations you recieve during childhood so I am not anti vax I am anti authoritarian. We have all seen plenty examples of this on reddit and other countriesthroughout the world. But again don't let some rude idiot  over the internet be the reason you don't take the vaccine if you are in a suseptible group. Make your own mind up, weigh the pros and cons for yourself and then decide. I do not blame you if you don't get it and I will NEVER support forceful vaccination. I am a 29 year old athletic male in good health. I myself will not recieve it until we know what the short and long term side effects are if any and it has full approval by the FDA. But when both of those criteria are met I plan to take it. Until then I will wear a mask where necessary, wash my hands more often then usual (I hope all of us do this anyways) get plenty of exercise and vitamin D and live my life as I've done before this virus and will continue to do afterwards. I do not accept thenewnormal and that is what this sub is supposed to be about. With that said I wish you all the best during these wierd times.</p></p>

        <p>I seemed out a doctor that would prescribe ivermectin as prophylaxis. I have a copay. I would only keep it around for early treatment if I did not live with people that are at risk. I am doing my part and it does not involve getting the jab. The vaccines are failing in the real world. Look at Gibraltar, Israel, the UK, and the counties in the US with the highest vaccination rates. The vaccines are not the answer. They are dangerous.</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to insult anyone's intelligence. Again everyone has to weigh the consequences for themselves and make decisions based on their conclusions. There are just as many examples of the government doing good for people and their rights than there is of the government doing wrong.</p>

        <p>I completely agree, the best government is a small government. But to say they have done zero good and have always been benevolent is itself nonsensical. Again I understand where your coming from I really do. I'm not trying to force you to do something against your will nor do I want any other entity to do so. I just want people to decide for themselves.</p>
