    <strong>Why you should break every single cootievirus restriction out there (Thought Exercise)</strong>
    <p><p>The effectiveness of the macaronivirus propaganda is based on fear, and the fear is based on self preservation. At first, people were afraid of dying of the virus (except those who noticed, even during the horror-porn vids from China, that the survival rate was in excess of 88%), but as people noticed that their friends, family and neighbors were not dying, the fear was transmuted into fear of social shaming, job loss and other punitive measures.</p>
<p>"To do the thing you fear is the death of fear itself."</p>
<p>The first and easiest thing to break your fear of is getting rejected or blocked at a supermarket for not wearing a mask. It is the easiest because in my experience it is the one where you can most easily sweet-talk your way out. (I've had some success here). If you cannot, then just leave. The cops aren't coming.</p>
<p>The second, harder thing to do is to do things that threaten fines but are not actual felonies. Because the legal movement against VirusRegime is growing, you may find a sympathetic lawyer who will take your case pro-bono. Even here in California, businesses restaurants and churches are openly defying the orders--one church in San Jose has racked up $325,000 in fines for refusing to shut down, because the pastor is certain he can beat the city/state in court. Even if you get a fine, DON'T PAY IT.  Fight it--if you fight a speeding ticket in court, the judge is likely to throw the ticket away. The same principle applies here. If that doesn't work, then...</p>
<p>The next level is crimes that carry prison sentences. If you are worried about imprisonment, take stock of the past eight months and ask yourself if you have been living free. (Hint: unless you're living in one of the few non-lockdown questions, the answer is no). You already have a taste for government mandated restriction on your freedom, so this should be familiar for you. However, because many prisons got emptied "for fear of COVID" if there's another spike in cases they might let you out anyway. If that doesn't work out, here is the final level...</p>
<p><strong>Accept a worthy suffering.</strong> The reason why this propaganda war has been so successful is because we all grew up feeling entitled to a carefree, minimum-octogenarian lifespan where we can pursue all our sensual delights unimpeded. That is Boomer-tier delusion and has led to the degradation of society we are currently  experiencing. If in the 1960's humanity collectively entered Pleasure Island in Pinocchio, the 2020's is the decade where we turn into asses.</p>
<p>I know religion is not a popular topic on this site, generally, but the only way you can accept suffering and death where no praise and glory will be apparent is if you believe in God and in transcendent Goodness. The ones we have seen who have been all-in on the New Normal have been the run-of-the-mill modern atheists who are trying to cling to a semblance of virtue and who have no firm footing reason, morality and the natural law.</p>
<p>We <strong>know</strong> the VirusRegime is based on falsehood and that all these efforts to "save" us have caused untold misery that is worse than the disease. It is evil, and there is no shame in resisting evil, even if good appears to be on the scaffold, and evil appears to be on the throne.</p>
<p>Now, this last level of recommendations seems dramatic, which is precisely why I put it last! Don't rush into martyrdom until you've exhausted all possible avenues, and in the order I listed them. Remember, the WEF and all the assorted cabal cronies want you to die on their terms--which include suicide and despair.</p></p>
