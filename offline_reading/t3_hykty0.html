        <p>This is referring to food delivery apps. All the food delivery services have set no contact delivery to be the default when ordering. Some of them don't do a good job of notifying the customer about this. So the customer doesn't know and is expecting to take the food from the driver like normal.</p>
<p>A lot of drivers, for some reason, don't understand that it's now the default option, and think that the customer specifically chose no contact, and are confused (or scared) when the customer acts like it's a normal delivery.</p>
<p>I'm a delivery driver. This happens to me every day. I don't mind, personally, when a customer isn't afraid to take a delivery like a normal person. But it does create some awkward situations at other times.</p>
<p>Not sure what the OP is getting at with the hoax thing, though. Unless he's also unaware that no contact delivery is the default now.</p>

        <p>Do you work for Uber eats or door dash? As a customer I never choose leave at door because my apartment is a secured building. Rather than trying to buzz them in or risk having my food left in front of the main door or lobby Id rather go get it. When I order it says ‘do you want to try no contact delivery’ and I click no. Is Uber telling drivers it’s default?</p>

        <p>I deliver through Doordash and GrubHub. Both of those have made no contact delivery the default option. </p>
<p>I don't drive for Uber Eats, but from what I've read, they are the best about letting the customer and driver know if the delivery will be no contact or not. Doordash is the worst, for sure. Every day, multiple orders from Doordash that say, "leave at my door", but the customer obviously wasn't aware of that.</p>
<p>Keep choosing the option to take it from the driver. I had a customer today on GrubHub lose his whole order because of the no contact thing. He made a mistake on his address. Normally, this would result in the person at the wrong address saying, "This isn't my food." and I'd call to find the correct address. But with the no contact, he was out of luck. I'd left it at the door, like the app said, and had already gone on to the next delivery.</p>
