        <p>I find the division between people absolutely abhorrent. Wishing death on people who disagree with you due to not getting a jab that doesn't provide immunity? Even people wishing the worst of deaths on others because they have the jab? It's turned inhumane. </p>
<p>My only thing with the covid-19 jab is that it doesn't provide immunity,  yet people are adamant that it protects them, as if they are now immune, while wearing a mask and staying away from people. </p>
<p>I remember Boris talking about herd immunity and that if 50% of the population got it, it could be achieved. Now its the whole populace....when it doesn't provide immunity in the first place!</p>
<p>Everything feels like it's going mad, either that or I am!</p>

        <p>You’re not going mad.  This is the biggest assault on civil liberties I’ve seen in my life and I’m in my 30s.  This reminds me so much of the us vs. them fear mentality post 9/11, except this time it’s citizen against citizen instead of some foreign enemy.</p>
<p>The comments I see on Reddit.  The outright disdain for those who refuse to comply with this tyranny.  What they want to be done to people that don’t make the same decisions as them….  I’ve never seen commentary so disturbing upvoted by so many people.</p>
<p>This past weekend I finally mourned and buried my old life.  I accepted we’re never going back to that.  Even if we do the road to get there is going to be utter hell.  I’m so tired but until I’m dead the fight goes on.</p>

        <p>I hear you. It’s sad that a virus has changed the way we live our lives. It’s scary and overwhelming and it’s really, really uncomfortable to adapt like this. There is a new normal, and it has nothing to do with politics or tyranny. It was always going to be this way with this particular novel virus. And climate change means more of these adaptations in the future. It sucks. It’s hard. Therapy helps.</p>

        <p>Why dont you think it gives immunity? The vast majority of hospitalized covid patients are unvaccinated. The fact vaccinated individuals have been confirmed to produce inhibitory antibodies for upwards of 9 months after the shot is by definition immunity. Like yeah if youre vaccinated and stand next to a coughing covid patient in a elevator for 20 minutes you might get enough virus particles to lead to a few division cycles thats sufficient to test positive… But your memory immune response (the “immunity” people mean when they talk about infections) should be able to ramp up covid specific immune cell lineages like 1000x quicker than if it was with someone that had never been vaccinated or infected before. This would be to the point that the vaccinated person would most likely stay asymptomatic while the vaccinated person would take several days before their immune system could even begin clearing the infection (which is why we are only seeing non vaccinated people in the ICUs right now).</p>

        <p>Wow guys, i just stepped into the coronavirus sub and OH MY GOD!  The fear posts and replies and hatred towards those not vaccinating is out of control.  These people can't wait for boosters or to get their 4 year olds vaccinated so they can get back to normal, the Delta, the variants that are too come, etc...</p>
<p>Guys I'm in Florida, we're freaking open. I haven't worn a mask in maybe 3 months now (except for work while you walk around the building and take it off when you're at your desk, which whatever it's fine for now), i don't take extra precautions, my wife and little ones do not mask up when we go out. We've been to crowded shopping  malls, indoor dining, to a Dave and busters, to an indoor playground for the kids, groceries, stores, talk to neighbors, family gatherings indoors and outdoors, talk to coworkers (yeah we take them off), i mean... Literally back to normal life..... Have we been that freaking lucky to not get I'll with such a contagious variant out there?  What world am I living in where I don't worry about it?  I truly don't understand how I'm not sick yet!?!  I might be tempting the covid gods with this post, but damn what a sad world do the other people live in.</p>
<p>Stay healthy happy and safe everyone</p>

        <p>Is there not some policy against the violent rhetoric in that subreddit? It feels like every thread I see there has someone calling for the exile or execution of a huge portion of society. The fact that I got permanently banned from commenting there for saying that the freedom of expression is a civil right, is just the ironic cherry on top.</p>

        <p>I never thought I would be supportive of anything Jason Kenney and the UCP would do, but I'm extremely relieved they lifted all restrictions as of Canada Day here in Alberta. Really hoping that redneck AB revolts or doesn't even consider vaccine mandates. And I hope that by the time elections roll around, covid is in the rear-view mirror and I don't have to base my votes around covid response policy.</p>

        <p>My workplace just reinstated the coworker mask mandate. I never got to take mine off because I didn’t want the vax, but now everyone has to wear it again. A bunch of coworkers only got the vax so they could take off their masks. Oh the irony</p>

        <p>Just a quick one to inform about my experience with the Pfizer vaccine.</p>
<p>Got my first initial dose approx 2.5 months ago.
All was good after my first dose.
Had a mild reaction, slight fever, chills and a sore arm.</p>
<p>2nd dose was administered approx 3 weeks after my first.
2nd dose symptoms were much worse.
High fever, body sweats, chills, bad case of nausea, highly sore pain at the injection sight, approx had these symptoms for two days after that all clear.</p>
<p>Basically after my second dose I’ve been having a continuous list of symptoms such as:</p>
<p>Sharp pains in my chest.</p>
<p>Occasionally throughout the day experience a dizzy spell and loose my sense of balance.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to really explain it but it’s been feeling like my hearts beating out of my chest.</p>
<p>Basically been short of breath all the time and been breathing really fast. This is much worse when I’m lying down. Basically can’t breath at all.</p>
<p>Currently at my local hospital where I’ve been told I may have a case of myocarditis.</p>
<p>Im not sure the severity of my symptoms just yet. However I am a very fit and healthy 22 yo male. Never in my life had health difficulties or issues.
Before my vaccine I’m 100% I didn’t have these symptoms I have no idea what the chances of getting these symptoms are or if it’s serious.</p>
<p>Just a friendly warning to everyone to caution themselves.
At this point in Time I would not recommend getting the vaccine.
I would honestly rather of taken my chances with covid.</p>
<p>I will keep everyone posted with an update when I know more.</p>

        <p>I'll have to take the vaccine or I'll get fired/blacklisted "/ had to share with you guys, seems like mental rape honestly. And hearing my coworkers "if I was you I would ..." or "if I was the boss everyone would be vaccinated against their will". Why do people give their souls into this?</p>

        <p>Have to sit outside on the street at a coffee shop here in Chile. In the middle of winter. Only the vaccinated are allowed inside. Thankfully its not TOO cold. </p>
<p>Movie theater is finally open after a year and a half; for the vaccinated. Same with seating at the mall food court. The peasants have to take their food to go. The seated royalty all eat their Mcdonalds in ignorant bliss. </p>
<p>The two tier system is already here. They use "mobility passes" on their phone to demonstrate worthiness. And their only question is "why dont you just get the vaccine?" and not "why is this even allowed to happen." </p>

        <p>I realised why I am so angry today. Shower thoughts. 
It’s because I’m still slaving in a capitalist life style but I’ve lost all the privileges and freedoms that came with the social contract. Whereby I sell 20%+
of my actual life to work for corporations, so I can continue to earn money and live and pay taxes in this society… but with that I also get the benefits of freedom of movement, association, bodily autonomy, religion and opinion. But that’s not the case anymore.
Now, I slave in a capitalist system without any of the freedoms. The laws and rhetoric is coming out like socialism. But again, I’m not getting any of the benefits of that either. I’m not getting free healthcare, free education, transport, rations, whatever. I’m just getting the authoritarian rule. But we all just have to shut up and keep going. We are getting double fucked. Double penetrated by the government, the elite and the economic system that we are literally forced to endure.</p>

        <p>Pretty much.  Also you slave while the ultra rich, the elites, the political class does enjoy the freedoms They refuse you.</p>
<p>It's insane.  My advice? Break the rules. Find people that break them for whatever reason and so so as well.  Voice your concern and don't let anyone coerce you into silence and compliance.</p>

        <p>On the surface it seems like it would be, and while overall I don’t necessarily agree with the sentiments of this sub and it’s purpose, I am very much someone that remembers people are still human beings, even if I disagree with them. </p>
<p>My point was exactly that - a huge number of its citizens disagreed with this happening out of fear of contagion. On top of that - there’s already reports of supplies to fight Covid (tests, treatments, etc) being siphoned towards that event instead of where it should be.  Kind of messed up that with such a huge amount of planning it seems they have short comings so blatantly obvious.</p>

        <p>If it was “incredibly contagious” and if we were in a real pandemic there would be no olympics, no sports, no reality TV or SNL or live shows. There wouldn’t be crowds of 65,000 people gathering for an NBA finals game/parade. Are you that oblivious to what’s going on? If the entertainment/sports/leisure industries don’t take the “pandemic” seriously then why should we? Yet, we are the ones that get ostracized for not getting an experimental (non FDA approved) vaccine and not wanting to wear a mask. It’s so obvious what is going on and it’s truly sickening. I really hope people like you can wake up a little and see what’s actually going on.</p>

        <p>Surely we're not a minority the media wants the world to think we are? There have been tens of thousands of people protesting in the streets all across Europe, even in Ireland. The division is become exhausting, as I'm typing this, co-workers are talking about some family event, your damn family, and you're considering wether or not to "take a chance" or cancel. I mean are you for real? This shit has split families in two and its happened on this very island not 100 years ago. </p>
<p>The media has made me out to be sworn enemies with my grandparents because they've all been vaccinated and I havent. </p>
<p>Better yet, the mindless drones who read those articles and tweets like they're bible entries will support the claim that I'm a selfish murderer. </p>
<p>The same mindless drones who can't remember frothing at the mouth 18 months ago at people who chose to wear a mask because "the frontline workers need them more than us."</p>
<p>The same mindless drones who can't remember frothing at the mouth 18 months ago at those of us saying be weary of these mask mandates, they will lead to vaccines and digital certs, calling us dangerous misinformed conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>The same mindless drones who are frothing at the mouth at those of us right now protecting our freedom as well as theirs, because we have been forced to do their thinking for them.</p>
<p>These mindless drones, who can't decide which tooth to brush first will inevitably fall victim to conditioning and deny it flatout. </p>
<p>But we must remember, in my case at least, I was conditioned once too. There was a time when I used to buy the newspaper, or buy into online gossip. Was it my fault I was born and raised in a society that thrives off manipulation and control? No it wasn't. And it's not "pro-vaxxers" fault that they are victims to conditioning too. They just havent become aware of it yet, and that's not a good enough reason to hate them. </p>
<p>This pandemic has been in the works for decades, and enough of us have been following it to recognize where all of this is going. And you can't blame these people for being ignorant. They're too busy thinking wearing a mask and taking a trial gene therapy shot which has next to no benefits at this stage other than license to basic liberties, is enough to "protect each other." It's like wearing arm bands in space. </p>
<p>They don't know what they truly need protection from.</p>

        <p>Thats a whole lot more freedom than we have in Ireland. It's insane the amount of fearmongering on the news and radio over here. "1000+ cases a day, another lockdown this, young people causing that, cant do this because of the anti-vaxxers, but skim over the act theres been only 100 people in the whole country hospitalised at the moment. And guarantee that those people aren't in hospital solely due to covid. </p>
<p>I don't wear my mask going into the convenience store udnermeath my apartment anymore because they all know me and its grand, but for my own sake I put it on doing my groceries because there are security guards and slimey people who'd jump down your throat if you have a nostril exposed. Just going in to get my veg, not going for a debate or confrontation.</p>
<p>We need vaccine IDs now to get a simple coffee with a roof over our head, without one we're shunned to the street. Which isn't too bad during a heatwave, you'd be outside anyway, but I'd like to keep my choice to go indoors.</p>
<p>The contradictions are rampant - only the vaccinated can dine indoors, but doesn't matter if the staff are vaccinated because they're in the 18-35 age bracket so they're not as a high risk, but its their fault this delta bs is "running rampant," because "the youth don't care about the elderly," despite confining ourselves to our homes for 18 months so the "vulnerable" can be vaccinated, and now that's all done and dusted so the elderly vaccinated public can go have a meal indoors while being served by an unvaccinated server, who are more likely to spread the virus, even though vaccinations don't reduce the spread. <em>inhales</em></p>
<p>That's one hot topic at the moment. The mental gymnastics these people must endure is astounding, but what gets me at the moment is you say this to someone, they agree, and then go for their vaccine appointment and cheer when they get their cert. </p>
<p>It's only starting but by christmas, the unvaccinated won't be allowed go into any business.</p>

        <p>Dude that is narly, it's way different here. I also live in a small town in a rural area so like in the bigger cities it's a little different I can't say it's the same throughout my entire state. In bigger cities (austin, dallas and houston) I guess I could understand going to a store or somewhere and it's a lot of people you don't know, here it's like bob from down the street so everybody knows everybody. The smaller towns surrounding us are also the same no one really changed anything. I just carry around a mask in case I have to have one to get in somewhere but I think we officially made it against the law to enforce a mask here in Texas, so everybody pretty much stopped wearing them. If you walk in a place wearing one chances are you're most likely the only person wearing it and people are looking at you all weird. It's weird how it gives off the impression you might be sick if you wear one lol... anyways. I would say my view on the vaccine is everybody else can get it and I prolly won't lol, I'm not against it I just don't want it or feel like I need it. The scary part is how people are starting to get like "you're the problem" and then big gov is like "yeah, we need to track you!". being from Texas it's just like against what you stand for kind of I guess idk I just ain't with it lol especially when there's no real solid facts everything changes and acts fluid instead so go with the flow</p>

        <p>If you Google "how many Americans vaccinated" you'll get something like 47% last time I checked (try it yourself). Even by Google's answers, the non vaxed are the majority.  I showed this to my husband and he thought it was just because of the algorhythm on my phone, but his showed the same thing.  You'd NEVER know it, by the media headlines, of course.  We're like the weird outcasts - most people would probably guess we're like 5% or something.</p>

        <p>And just because they're vaccinated it doesn't mean that they believe they work? And just because we're unvaccinated doesn't mean we're conspiracy loons. I'd proudly accept being called one though, because its a sure fire way to identify someone, such as yourself, who has been maniplulated and conditioned into thinking someone who has basic scepticism about anything the news says is a conspiracy loon. </p>
<p>I've yet to come across any individual - in real life now, loud internet people don't count - that genuinely believes it works. </p>
<p>The <em>only</em> reason the people I know in my life that got it was they were pressured into getting it. They were tood they need it to work or they may lose their job, or those who want to eat a meal with a roof over their head, or because they want to go to a beach in Spain for a week. And afterwards, a lot of people are regretting getting it because it's not as effective as it was promised 3 months ago, and putting something into your system that you can't take out just for an indoor meal isn't worth it.</p>

        <p>Very good points you make, and I was never saying they thought exactly like me.</p>
<p>But, if, as you say, there's all these people who, for good reasons aren't getting the vax (unlike me, is the implication) what do you say about bars and public spaces in the UK, Ireland and elsewhere, who are refusing these people entry?  A negative test means nothing, and if they've already had it - who cares.  They need a vaccine record and that's it.  Do you think all these people should be denied entry into public places?  Sincere question.</p>

        <p>For those whose employers are mandating vaccines: Just say no! Stand up for yourself. In May I got an email saying everybody is required to be vaccinated by the beginning of July, but if you would like to request a "medical or religious exemption" contact HR. While I could have gotten away with a religious exemption and possibly even medical, I chose to just say no. I said I'm not getting a vaccine with unknown long-term side effects for a virus with an incredibly low mortality rate. </p>
<p>And guess what? I still have my job. Turned out to be an empty threat on their part. </p>
<p>Don't underestimate your value as an employee, especially in the current job market. They spent money training you and they don't want to lose you.</p>

        <p>That's a tough situation. I haven't had to look for a job during all this craziness, but I would recommend asking for their policy on vaccines and masks before you go for an interview. You don't want to waste your time on an interview if they won't hire you anyway without the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I've been going through several articles about the vaccine passports and what bothered me the most was the manipulative language.</p>
<p>They always say  these certificates will allow us access to public and private spaces, and help society return to normal.</p>
<p>But what it is really saying is that we will be denied everything on that list unless we comply. </p>
<p>Just the implication that we need this so they will "let us" exercise the rights we <strong>already</strong> had is insane.</p>
<p>Also... my girlfriend continues to be rather aggressive about the topic. She said "Which do you prefer? The traditional method of being dragged by the arm or icecream?"</p>
<p>Then I tried to defuse by saying "I want a PS5 :D", but... yeah. It was ugly.</p>
<p>It has been a truly beautiful relationship until this whole madness came along, so I'm hoping she will eventually give up.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I'll find out in about a month, when my age group's turn comes.</p>

        <p>Recently,  a nearby restaurant closed because a vaccinated employee tested positive for covid.  People who have been vaccinated can still contract, spread, and even die from covid.   So when you consider that people can still catch and spread covid, unvaccinated or not.. the passport idea just seems like a way to identify and reward people who obey and punish/restrict those who don't.</p>

        <p>I have to say, there was a period of a few months where I did support all this crap. I wholeheartedly approved of these draconian measures, and internally mocked those who were skeptical. Lately I've been (justifiably) feeling extremely foolish for my past opinions, and I can't stop beating myself up for it.

        <p>We all make mistakes. This was the most aggressive propaganda campaign in modern history, if not ever. The majority of the population were fooled, few have been brave enough to admit they are wrong and take up with the other side. Consider yourself brave for admitting you were wrong. Mark Passio says it's one of the most difficult things to do, so good on you for not doubling down with the wrong think!! (PS check out his podcast starting at the beginning from 2010 if you really want your mind blown. It's mostly about mind control, so you will see how the master manipulators used all of these tactics to deceive the masses)</p>

        <p>I also fell for it the first months and the first period of (luckily mild) lockdown in my country. 
We saw images of people dying because IC's were full in Italy and it was said we headed that direction aswell. It seemed logical to do something to prevent that. 
They were saying we needed(natural) herd immunity and to flatten the curve.
That to me sounded good, but from there it became more and more incredibile. 
The curve was flattened but now they looked at test results (not illness), we were waiting for vaccines, other medicine was discouraged, no measures were taken to have more hospital start/ beds etc etc. 
I was never into conspiracy theories before, but honestly I do not understand why so many people still do not open their eyes for whats going on. 
So at least we can congratulate ourselves for doing that while the Plandemic is still going on in full force.</p>

        <p>Same. Two weeks to flatten the curve? No problem! People should wash hands, not cough and sneeze on people, and stay home or wear a mask when feeling ill? That’s basically common sense! Everyone should wear a mask in public? I mean, lots of old people are dying, can’t hurt to wear one.</p>
<p>All the arbitrary rules kinda got to me (like closing bars early. I don’t even go to bars, but did they really think COVID only came out after 10 PM? Essential businesses can only sell “essential” supplies? Well, that seems kind of objective, and I don’t think COVID cares if you’re at Walmart for toilet paper or electronics, but maybe it’ll get people to shop online and stay out of crowded places), but I bit my tongue. People wearing masks alone in their car or while jogging seemed dumb, but whatever, didn’t affect me. The vaccine seemed rushed and I wanted to wait on it, but I knew lots of people who got it early and respected their decision. </p>
<p>Something about people’s attitudes the past few months done pushed me over the edge. The self-righteousness. The inability to mind their own business. The name-calling. The moral superiority. The lack of critical thinking and dog piling anyone who questioned anything at all (Heaven forbid you ask if a kid with severe COVID had an underlying condition. Then you’re victim blaming and want kids with chronic conditions to die rather than trying to see if there’s a pattern). The fact that “your mask protects me and my mask protects me” transitioned to “your vaccine protects me and my vaccine protects me.”</p>
<p>I still love and respect a lot of people who still wear masks and are vaccinated. Those people also respect my decisions. Keyboard warriors on the Internet, on the other hand, think I should be thrown in a gulag.</p>

        <p>Take it as a learning lesson and benefit from it... that is the best way to 'forgive' yourself.  No reason to be ashamed if you learn from it, gather yourself up and come out better for the experience.  Hopefully what you have learned is to not believe everything you hear pushed on MSM, and to do due diligence in researching things yourself to find out how accurate, or how spun and distorted, news stories are.  And by due diligence, I mean finding statistics, reports, studies and information online for yourself from reputatable sources.  I used the DHS, CDC, UN, .gov sites, WHO, NIH, AMA, etc to find information related to covid.  Second line of research is news sources and organizations online (but beware of skewed reporting and opinion pieces and also check left leaning, right leaning and international outlets), and lastly social media (such as YouTube, blogs, etc - these can be great sources of info, but also opinion sites filled with untrue information, so check to see who published the info and research to back up claims).</p>
<p>I learned from a mentor of mine 'Believe none of what you hear, and half of what you see'.  It's a great piece of advice, especially in today's world where most television programming and news is very opinionated or flat-out false.</p>
<p>So when you hear something shocking on TV, take a breath, step-back, get some perspective, and research.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-many-people-die-each-day/">Here's </a> a nice chart from World Economic Forum comparing causes of deaths globally that does a good visual representation to put covid in perspective.</p>

        <p>It's truly starting to sink in now that I'll have to say goodbye foregood to what my life used to be. I live in the Netherlands and if I want to do anything, go anywhere, visit a museum or a concert or whatever, soon I will have to have been injected (and able to prove it), gotten covid within the last 6 months, or provide a negative covid test result on an app.</p>
<p>No matter how much I ingore these ridiculous rules, I somehow never got the Cold of Death (despite being hopeful about catching it), and I absolutely <em>refuse</em> to participate in this absolute utter madness of having to prove that I don't have covid. (not even considering the mRNA treatment injection)</p>
<p>It's a system of madness and I won't participate in this in any capacity. If the rules are this oppressive. laughable and ridiculous, I won't play, I'll just refuse to play this game altogether.</p>
<p>I'm not even interested in the specific rules of my country as of now or in a month or whatever. I know where it's all headed. France, the UK, other countries... it'll be ''well, there're differences between European countries and their measures so that's confusing to people and it'd be unfair if tourists have more rights than the inhabitants of the country that they're visiting so it's best to just streamline the whole thing and have a few local differences to pay lip service to national autonomy lol'' So imo it doesn't really matter where you live or what they do where, it'll all be the same/entirely similar. Maybe one area opens up for a while while another locks down and vice versa, but in principle it'll all be the same.</p>
<p>See how fast it happens? Within like a year and a half we're stuck in a nightmarish reality that should be nothing more than the wet dream of a tyrannical madman.</p>

        <p>We're on the same page. I'm in the US, my whole family is from Holland. I'm not playing this game anymore. I curated and created a completely different online experience after the events of last year (Covid, riots, virtue signaling, black boxes, etc) I unfollowed anyone that was on board with it. I'm doing the same thing now IRL. I don't need to go to breweries, out to eat, casinos, movies, etc. Why give people my money who hate me?? Instead I'll get back to outdoors, cooking at home, reading, running, writing, drawing, etc. I'm only worried about groceries, but I'll actively stock up in the meantime</p>

        <p>I feel ya. Moved from Holland to Switzerland a year ago. At the start I was really glad with the seemingly more relaxed approach of the Swiss but it's clearly heading in the same direction. It's honestly shocking how many people are demanding the government take their rights away. I can't help but feel disgusted. The certificate is here and it's here to stay. Civil disobedience is the only option but it can be hard when the repercussions are high. I already submitted to getting tested once because I wasn't willing to let my registration fee and opportunity to run an awesome mountain race go to waste.</p>

<p>Why are people so panicked about a freaking tiny particle called a virus? We have a natural immune system that can kill it fine in most people. See what I did here?</p>
<p>Idk why you are so affraid of this that you prefer telling other people to inject some experimental substances into their body.</p>
<p>&rt; Would you rather 2 shots or “give up your old life for good”?</p>
<p>You are only giving up something by complying by this bullshit. Everything else are freedoms stolen by the government.</p>

        <p>I feel hopeless. And tired. Honestly though, at this point I don't even want to support businesses/entertainers/restaurants/venues etc who go along with all these crazy measures and virtue signal. I've come to realize these people hate me, why in the world would I want to contribute to them financially, much less sacrifice my body and principles so I can what, go see a show or eat a taco in public?? I'm over it. I'm actively planning to move to Texas, but if I can't afford that, a rural city in my state.</p>

        <p>It’s a free market. If you don’t want to support them then don’t. But it’s their place of business, their rules. Tons of restaurants have a mandatory shirt and shoes policy. If you hated wearing shoes would you be bitching about that? </p>
<p>Either shop there or don’t. Free market, like I said.</p>
<p>Must be so hard though, wearing a piece of cloth over your mouth for 20 minutes while you shop. Or 30 seconds while you order.</p>

        <p>I am vax hesitant and I just don't know what to believe.  But I do have to say, this community has been so nice for me.  If I speak my views on this topic in any other subreddit, I'm banned, and then I get banned in other subs unrelated.  When I ask the mods respectfully, I get chastised and belittled with little to no explanation.  Like they already think I'm this crazy person who is off its meds, and that makes me to feel like I'm a crazy person.  Then I get such angry angry people yelling at me and calling me names.  I don't get why I'm such a vermin to them?  They are straight up cruel.  I'm a hippie at heart and believe in kumbaya and treating others, even if you don't agree with them, with a certain level of kindness.  It all just makes me immensely sad to see such vitriol.  I am tempted to just leave reddit, but I like this sub.  I like that I can speak freely about what concerns me and I'm not belittled or chastised.  I am met with other people that are equally confused about the world, but working together to try to understand it.</p>

        <p>You don’t need to use their terms. The reason these would be authoritarians have been so successful is by their control of the language. Whether it be re-defining existing words or creating new ones, it is an effective means of quieting opposition if their opponents are unaware of what the tactics are. So, don’t worry about what words they choose to define you as.</p>
<p>I’m inherently kind of an asshole so I have no problems ruffling feathers or mocking the shallow beliefs of the adherents of the Branch Covidians. You seem like a nice person though and kindness is unfortunately preyed upon by the authoritarians. </p>
<p>Stay true to yourself and don’t let others define what you are or what you believe. You are not as isolated as the Branch Covidians and other cultists want you to believe.</p>

        <p>I live with my parents (currently making plans to move out now)
My mom told me my dad refuses to speak to me until I get vaccinated and my mom is guilt tripping me with “you’re going to die”. I told her I’ll wait another year to see what the data shows about covid and she retorts with “you might not have that much time left”. I’m 21, 5’4, 120 pounds (f).  The alcohol I drink is more likely to cause me harm than covid will. My parents are vaccinated. They’ll be fine. 
Im mentally exhausted from all this. I don’t know what to do.</p>

<p>Even by the official numbers, people under 30 have been virtually untouched by sars-cov-2.</p>
<p>Hell, go donate blood. You'll get a free antibody test, if you have antibodies then the research says you're just as immune as the vaccinated. Even if the antibody test is "covid negative" i.e. you don't have an active infection, it can still show you having a non-zero amount of antibodies against sars-cov-2.</p>
<p>Not that any of this will convince them. Can't reason someone out of a position they weren't reasoned in to.</p>

        <p>Move out. Find people that you feel good to have around / create your own family. You are very young, its perfectly normal to have shifts in your social-circles because we all grow and develop, sometimes in different directions in areas so dear to our heart that we cant deal with one another.</p>
<p>Also, its perfectly fine, especially for parents and their kids to go through such phases. I dont think I know a single person who didnt hate their parents / kids at some point in life. Often this doesnt last and eventually you both grow and relearn to accept/love one another.</p>

        <p>God, the propaganda, social conditioning, and circle-jerking is getting old.</p>
<p>If I go on r/Askreddit , every other post is <em>"Antivaxxers of Reddit, why are you so retarded?"</em> and you know they're all saying it for Karma points.</p>
<p>Other News subs, including r/nottheonion keep posting crap like <em>"Man who mocked vaccines died of COVID har har har"</em></p>
<p>Even if I go on Yahoo, at least 2 news articles on the front page will be about "One group responsible for COVID surge" (spoiler unvaccinated) or some crap about Irrational fears of antivaxxers. </p>
<p>Is there any escaping this madness? I suppose logging off the internet entirely is the only refuge?</p>

        <p>I have just dropped another friend because of her sheer idiocy regarding this situation. </p>
<p>Here's the conversation we had this morning:</p>
<p>Me: The thing is, the cases are going to go up when vitamin D deficiency season comes at the end of the year. The media are already blaming the uninjected for causing variants. When the deaths shoot up later this year they're going to blame us again. Don't believe a word of it. </p>
<p>Her: Vitamin D deficiency has nothing to do with it. That's a conspiracy theory. </p>
<p>Me: If you look at the government data, you will see that most of the people who died had low levels of vitamin D. </p>
<p>Her: They're faking that data to try to encourage everybody to live a healthier lifestyle. </p>
<p>Me: Do you have any evidence to back that claim up?  Also, the media make no mention of this. You need to do your own research to find it out. If the government are lying about this to encourage healthy lifestyles, then why aren't the media talking about it? </p>
<p>Her: It's all a lie. The government data shows that most of the deaths have been in people who are 80+ too, but that's misleading. It doesn't matter if you are 30 with no medical conditions or an 80 year old diabetic. Both are equally likely of dying of COVID. The virus doesn't discriminate.</p>
<p>Me: Do you have any evidence that they are lying about that? Why would they lie about it? </p>
<p>Her: They don't want to scare younger people. </p>
<p>Me: You're kidding me right? The media have been fearmongering for over a year and there have been several efforts to scare young adults into getting injected. Most of the fearmongering at the moment is specifically targeted at younger people. </p>
<p>She didn't reply to that. Now what she is saying about the government lying about who has died is clearly a conspiracy theory, yet we are supposed to be the conspiracy theorists for believing the data...</p>

<p>Like, yes. If there was a crazy disease fucking people up left right and centre the government would lie. Because how do you stop panic? Looting? Riots? How are you gonna convince essential workers to work? If there was a <strong>pandemic</strong> people are gonna flee, no ones gonna work for $5 an hour, they’ll resort to crime instead. </p>
<p>But idiot, it’s been <strong>EIGHTEEN MONTHS</strong>!! </p>
<p>You don’t think we’d have noticed if all of Florida had died by now? You don’t think it’d have leaked out that the US marines no longer exist because they all died of Covid??</p>

        <p>&rt;Do people just not have attention spans or something??</p>
<p>Ya think???</p>
<p>Yes, it's an unfortunate aspect of human behavior that we are wired to upvote something with immediate gratification ie. memes, more than something that requires a 30 second commitment of our attention.  It sucks.</p>

        <p>Yes. Attention span has been shortened. This is partly because of the structure of social media, and partly because of health changes caused by modern environments that were not prevalent in previous epochs, such as the prevalence of plastics.</p>
<p>The problem with most social media sites is that it is not a real conversation, in the sense that it does not have the normal back and forth you would expect at the rate you would expect with the nonverbal cues and the timing you would expect in a normal conversation. These factors heavily influence how people approach them, and it manifests in part as decreased relative investment in the conversation.</p>

        <p>Ugh. I'm officially the only unvaccinated person in my friend group. 2 months ago, I spent the night getting drunk with a couple of close friends, and we spoke candidly about Covid and the potential risks of the Covid-19 vaccine. Like me, they are truth seekers and very skeptical. My partner is vaccinated, and I expressed to them that I was worried about not being able to travel internationally with him. They were the ones that made me realize that the vaccine requirements may only be temporary, and they urged me to just wait it out. Well, ever since that day I've been thinking about what they said and it's bolstered my confidence in not rushing to get vaccinated. This past weekend I saw them, and I was informed by them that they went to get their 1st shots. One of them works in an industry where there is a lot of pressure to get vaxxed, and apparently they couldn't deal with the pressure and stress that was coming from their co-workers and upper management. The other one didn't want to leave them in the dust, so they both got it together. I'm not angry, but I'm feeling alienated in my choice these days. The city that I live in is very "woke" and they recently released stats that indicate that almost everyone whose eligible has gotten at least one dose. People seem to be convinced that the vaccines are safe, because everyone is getting them and no one we know has had any serious adverse effects, and they aren't remotely worried about long term effects or the possibility of another lockdown this fall. It's a weird feeling to be alone.</p>

        <p>Stay strong and don't give in. Peer pressure is the worst reason to do anything. Being alone can be uncomfortable, but feeling alone when in the midst of other is even more miserable. Better to be authentic to you and have no one then give up your principles. (Also, you will not be alone because there are millions of us!)</p>

        <p>I’d normally agree with this because people often don’t realize that their viewpoint in a debate is also putting pressure and influence on the person they’re speaking to when referencing another party doing the same, but in this case I think the OP was pretty clear on their position.</p>
<p>That’s the thing when people give you advice though, it’s often never completely in your own interest. Human nature I guess.</p>

        <p>Think of it like the flu.  No one was freaking out in the past if you didn’t get a flu vaccine because it was understood that an individual is responsible only for their own health.</p>
<p>Here is a respiratory illness which is a third LESS deadly for young people than flu, yet the vaccine is being pushed indiscriminately. </p>
<p>Also remember- these are still experimental by every definition of the word.</p>
<p>It only makes logical sense to not get it - especially when side effects are extreme and long term data is unknown</p>

        <p>So it's happening. My husband's work is forcing the jabs on all employees.
This isn't as simple as quitting and finding a better job. That's not an option.
Fuck you assholes that say that "you're not being forced to get the shots" bullshit!!! THIS is fucking force!!!
So fucking sick with worry right now. I know my husband is pissed.
He was at least hoping they'd wait until it was FDA approved (not that that would've been much better).</p>

        <p>Wait it out don’t do it. Wait for the email where they threaten him specifically with termination if he doesn’t get the vaccine. So that way you might be able to take them to court or if he does eventually take it and gets sick from it you might be able to take them to court for forcing it on him. Or none of this might work but at least you have it in writing that you were coerced.</p>

        <p>Exactly this, except don't sign anything or use the term "resigned". Your husband just isn't getting the vaccine, any action that his employer takes is 100% on them. He keeps going in until they tell him in writing to stop. If his boss asks "are you going to get the vaccine or give your notice." The answer is, "neither."</p>

        <p>Just a parallel concept I was thinking about recently...</p>
<p>I 100% believe in the power of meditation. I think meditation would save us all. I believe it has the power to cure the body and even save lives.</p>
<p>But if I became part of a society that was hellbent on forcing all humans to meditate, to hold proof that they meditate to have full freedom, and one that censored anyone dissenting the mainstream narrative of it being beneficial for society, Id be speaking out against the response of the government as I am now.</p>
<p>So that begs the question.. Why are the maskers and the vaxxed completely fine with this?</p>
<p>The reasons people comply are the same reasons they're not backing us.. I mean if they started throwing us in camps, how many would stand up then?</p>

        <p>Damn, you need to get a new doctor. My wife went to our family doctor today, He did ask her if she got it or if she will be getting it, she said no and he said "That's fine" and moved on with the appointment. Wife also noticed the receptionist or nurse that brought her in was initially not wearing a mask when she greeted her.</p>

        <p>Private businesses can deny you for anything. Ever been to a restaurant that says shirt and shoes required? Yeah that’s not a law, that’s their rules. If a doctor says you have to be vaccinated (I doubt that, you’re probably allowed to wear a mask), then that’s on you. Free market. Find a doctor who doesn’t require it.</p>

        <p>No, private businesses cannot deny you for anything.  How can you possibly make this assertion growing up in the U.S.?  Did you forget the civil rights acts, public accommodations law, the ADA, the colorado baker gay wedding case?  The vaccine manufacturer info sheets, as well as the statute authorizing the EUAs, all prohibit healthcare providers from denying you healthcare on the basis of not taking the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Uhh, free market. They can still deny you for anything. Whether they’re “reputable” or not. Fucking tons of fancy restaurants literally won’t serve you unless you’re dressed properly. I’d say those are all respected, reputable private businesses. But yet they deny service to people who don’t follow their dress code? GASP, how can that be? How can a business be reputable AND have a dress code?</p>
<p>Yeah, same shit with masks. If they don’t want you wearing something, that’s their right. If they require you to wear something, that’s their right.</p>

        <p>Got reamed by a group for commenting on a post about a woman being told by a doctor not to let her child be around a friend's child who hasn't been vaccinated. </p>
<p>All I said was that her kid was protected, so it seems weird (and mostly a socially driven not scientific) to take that advice. How do people not understand that the idea behind vaccines is that the vaccinated person has antibodies...if another person doesn't they are at 'risk" not you? (Except for the COVID-19 injection of course, but that wasn't the subject. It was baby vaccines.) Why are people even using the vaccines if they don't believe that they are protected by them? </p>
<p>And there are way more important things in life than ostracizing people for this. It seems more like social manipulation than protection. People get downright hateful. How am I the jerk in this situation? I would never tell a mother that she was an idiot for vaccinating her kid! It's a personal choice. It's a medical decision.</p>
<p>I've worked around special needs adults for 12 years, some of whom have literally been injured by vaccines as babies/children. Like it's real. It's not just people making things up. These families have to live with the damage for the rest of their lives. One family actually won a law suit against the pharmaceutical company, for what happened to their daughter, which is so rare to see them held accountable. There is a federal data base that gathers stats on these things. How can it be called untrue if there is evidence?</p>
<p>How can people act like people who want to avoid this risk deserve to be treated terribly? No one is allowed to treat me like that for any other reason. And I won't allow it for this.</p>

<p>Seroprevalence studies put the global infection fatality ratio (IFR) at 0.15%</p>
<p>I generally have a policy of not putting unnecessary drugs in my body. I don't do recreational drugs, I don't take medicines I don't need, I try not to eat unhealthy food.</p>
<p>Why in the world would I jam a "warp speed", Trump-developed drug in my arm when I absolutely don't need it? As a healthy man in my mid-30s I have a better chance of dying from about 100 other things than Covid. My parents got the vaccine because they're old, my kids don't need it because sars-cov-2 generally doeasn't even affect kids.</p>

        <p>&rt;don’t be surprised when everything locks up again because of low vaccination rates</p>
<p>I won't be, in fact it's the reason I'm on this forum - because I disagree with the government's response to the pandemic and I want to keep abreast of events.</p>
<p>This is actually one of the primary reasons I have stopped participating in covid mitigation efforts after masking/distancing/locking down for a year straight - the government is looking <em>solely</em> at vaccination when we know that prior infection confers immunity on par with the vaccine.</p>
<p>Do you believe that authoritarian measures are justified in the face of low vaccination rates? If so, why? Would you be open to also accepting antibody tests, or having a positive covid test in the past, in addition to vaccination?</p>

        <p>This is most likely wishful thinking but I thought I'd share. I went to the dentist yesterday and have gotten friendly with the dentist who has been doing my uncle's teeth for years and I know his cousins. At the height of the pandemic when I came in for a cleaning he was talking to me about Covid not really saying his opinion of it. I later found out he was "one of us". This man is educated af and credible. He was the one who told me about the doctors who got banned including Dr. Gold and Dr. Raoult . He got me interested in all of this tbh because if someone from the medical community is questioning it, we sure as hell aren't wrong to question it either! </p>
<p>Anyway I asked him if he thinks that the majority of employers will require people to get vaccinated once DFA approved (I'm in the public sector in California...). Per him, he said he didn't think so because if you get sick from the vaccine (especially now with a lot of people reporting side effects), employers don't want to be held liable since you had to get vaccinated to keep your job. I'm just holding onto a little hope.</p>

        <p>Sad to say, I think it's wishful thinking indeed. Big Pharma has too much power, and if indeed this is a legal loophole (meaning, employers could be held liable), it will be speedily closed at the federal level after the first successful court challenge (which may not even happen, courts are very much on "their" side in most matters).</p>
<p>What do you expect when everybody who is anybody meets behind closed doors (secret society meetings) to get their real marching orders? There is an invisible hierarchy that calls all the real shots - everything we see in public is downstream of the original agenda.</p>

        <p>I lost a really good friend of 3 years over this mess, and the most infuriating part to me is her inconsistency throughout it all. Before any of us were vaxxed, she would still hangout with me at patios outside bars, or in her backyard – despite her extremely cautious mentality. At one point during last summer she even had me INSIDE her basement as we watched tv together (I think she asked me to keep my mask on tho, but still, it was shocking she even let me into her home). </p>
<p>NOW that she's fully vaxxed tho, and I'm not, she says she doesn't want to be near me apart from having to work together, because obviously being inside a building next to each other is way safer than us being outside at a restaurant. Where is the logic?!?!? How are people so damn blind to themselves!?!?</p>

        <p>Oh I feel you on that . I got dumped because of this shit . Pre vaccines we were going out for dates at restaurants all the time after she got her shot and I said I wanted to wait she said I was unsafe to go to restaurants now . Apparently when she was doing it it was fine but now that she's vaxxed and I'm not all of a sudden I'm a danger to society .</p>

        <p>Sad. But friends like these arent real friends. 
A friend of mine actually died from (well with) Covid, he had bad conditions already, but C speeded things up. 
He asked me to come to his death bed and I didnt think about it twice. I went, did put a mask on there but other than that just sat with him. Nor did the hospital require me to put on a moonsuit or so. 
I was fine and so was his wife that was with him all the time.</p>

        <p>I guess I just don't get it because I've never had many friends anyway, but I'd be done with that friendship fairly shortly after they asked me to sacrifice my comfort while performing an activity that primarily involves sitting on my ass being lazy and comfortable. I don't go to theaters anymore because it isn't worth paying money to watch a movie with shoes on and I wouldn't go to a friend's house for TV/movies either if they had a dress code of any kind. You wanna go shopping together, I'll wear a bandana over my face to avoid legal trouble. I'm not kissing your ass in your home anymore than you'd kiss my ass in my home.</p>

        <p>I've seen the couple down on the corner - contrary to what many on this sub seem to believe, both hardcore Trumpers - wear a mask just doing yardwork. I'd assume maybe it's just for pollen and/or pollution - my husband and I do something similar with a bandana - but it'd be an interesting coincidence for so many people to develop such bad allergies when the media just-so-happens to be pushing masks anyway.</p>

<p>Well, that's because they're <em>literally</em> hypnotized/under a spell. It's called trauma-based mind control. Means exactly what it sounds like it means.</p>
<p>Consistent, repeated (especially audio-visual or sexual) trauma + resulting disassociated state = ridiculously suggestible subject</p>

<p>I'm currently living in France and totally aware of this coronavirus scam trying to fight this propaganda brainwashing everyone. I finished my school right before first lockdown and couldn't work until now. I've got a once in a lifetime proposal for work, a unique opportunity... but the director wants me to be vaccinated (the work won't be set in France) 
I'm so lost and upset right now, I feel trapped. Do you think I should find a doctor who'll give me a 'fake' jab and certification ? I don't want to give up on life, but i've been working so hard to be where I am today, it's as if i've worked for nothing...</p>

        <p>Yes I would try it. But remember they're gonna mandate boosters and other "vaccines" in the future.  I guess you could say you had a bad reaction to the first one, when it comes time for all that.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I forgot to put on my mask when using public transport, like I genuinely forgot. It was already pretty late and there weren't many people around anyway, however there was an elderly who sat in the same wagon and I saw that he also 'forgot' to put it on. I felt a sense of relief.</p>

        <p>So my boss told us we all need to take the vaccine to work. I initially refused and then he came with a very passive aggressive tone. You guys have no idea how bad I'm feeling right now. Still didn't get the date or anything but I'm trying to find a way to avoid it. Man I can't believe I'm pushed to it and everyone doesn't respect my opinion. Seriously, I almost cried when I had to say yes and I made it pretty clear I was doing it just to prevent getting fired/blacklisted. This is ridiculous..</p>

        <p>Sigh. Another friend who was against the vaccine and saw all of the incoherent propaganda as bullshit has been forced into it by her family. As in, threatened to be disowned and not be allowed around her family. I went with her to the appointment after saying everything I could, but she said her mind was made up. </p>
<p>We got to the CVS and there was a teenage girl in front of us getting her shot. She was so scared, talking about how it was going to kill her. What the fuck are we doing to people ?!</p>

        <p>I've been receiving messages on my instagram after starting my art awareness project from women who are vaccine injured. They are so upset with themselves, because they didn't want to get it in the first place and felt pressured to do so. One said "I feel like I killed myself, I'm so disappointed in myself."

        <p>I still haven’t found one good argument on why I should get vaccinated when I’ve had Covid? Every source online says natural immunity is long lasting and more effective then any of the vaccines. Why are we ignoring the millions who have had Covid?</p>

        <p>Was browsing other subreddits… news articles and such that brought up about new COVID Varients and unvaccination and all that. </p>
<p>It’s absolutely insane how hostile people can be towards those who like to make choices. </p>
<p>People are saying you need to get vaxxed and waxed in order to stop the spread of COVID! But also, if you’re vaxxed then you can still catch COVID! But if you’re vaxxed, you have the antibodies to not get hurt! </p>
<p>So if I decided that I can’t be assed that COVID got me on a ventilator why do all these sheep keep saying “fuck the anti-vax, hope you all die” </p>
<p>Bro if someone doesn’t want to get vaccinated and you’re vaccinated who cares just move on with life jfc</p>

        <p>How? </p>
<p>They won't allow you inside, they'll call police. It's not like the US</p>
<p>Here, store owners and their employees are forced by law to comply or they get fined, store closed by law or even jail time.</p>
<p>Besides, even if police releases me after fining me, re-entering the same store will just restart the whole process of police bringing me to their HQ and making questions.</p>
<p>They might even jail me if I repeat this.</p>

        <p>Honestly Italybro, get the fuck out of there. It might sound harsh. It might sound extreme. But Italy was first to bend the knee, and is now at it again. There will come nothing good from this. Even if it means going by foot, get yourself somewhere deep into the countryside away from the city. Try to befriend farmers. Because you are going to need them in a year or so. Things will not get much better from here on.</p>

        <p>Well sis, it is always worth a shot. Even without welfare or job, it could pay off to get to know those around you better. Sounds like very weak advice (Just meet people lol) but what i mean is a little more complicated. If you can befriend a vaccinated person who caved in but still shares your ideas, you could circumvent the grocery store problem as they could just get it for you (Future rationing plans may be another problem). Knowing two or three of those people makes it even more easy. Make sure to be able to get food and water more independently from your government. This is where the farmers come in. Grow your own things if possible. A shady family business grocer who doesn't take it too heavy with the rules could get you your things through the backdoor if you could bribe him.</p>
<p>In short, the closer to earth vague people are better friends than corporate drones and their masters.</p>
<p>Public transport is a lot harder, but going by foot, driving with a friend, or biking may save the money you would've used for transport for arguably more important things. What are your options?</p>

        <p>I’m really sorry for you. But nothing will change if you aren’t willing to go to jail for this. If they pull that shit here in the states, I will fight to the death and I will take people down with me! Talk to others likeminded. Also, you could leave the country. France has fought back successfully against the Green Pass. Otherwise, you’ll have to learn to forage for food and hunt local animals.</p>

        <p>My family is starting to emotionally blackmail me. </p>
<p>I thought we were passed this shit, but now they’re starting to say the won’t see me again until I’m vaxxed. I basically just told em whatever that’s your choice, and any issues they have is only on your side. I had a family member literally call me crying the other day that don’t want to lose me. Really just trying to get my emotions up to give in. </p>
<p>I could easily just lie, but I don’t want to. I’m taking a stance and staying with it. The fact they’re pulling all this petty bullshit is scary considering I’ve always been on good terms with everyone.</p>

        <p>Originally I would have agreed with you. But they let this go way too far with the petty drama. Threatening me with not seeing me until I’m vaxxed. Calling my crying. Non stop peer pressuring.</p>
<p>This is no longer about my health. This is about them not being able to accept my decision and letting the media control their emotions. This is a political issue disguised as a concern for my health.</p>

        <p>I am convinced that some subs, like LeopardsAteMyFace and Selfawarewolves, are designed to make people accept government behaviors that they normally wouldn't, by making them about the Boogeyman.</p>
<p>Right now on that sub there's a bunch of people cheering authoritarian anti-riot laws because "Trumpers" passed them "Trumpers" we're detained by them.</p>
<p>It's like, they really got taken from "ACAB" to "I love the cops" just by invoking the Boogeyman. Between that, and the media method of inventing a straw man and attacking it (5g/microchip) so that the premise is never considered, I am really starting to learn some of these disinfo tactics. I am shocked that I have fallen for this kind of thing for 20 years.</p>

        <p>Sadly they're most likely to take place where I live sadly, all senators vote in favor on it, it was almost voted as "urgency matter" in the deputy chamber but by a clutch voting they decided it was not urgent.</p>
<p>I think they're gladly trying to keep this aside as elections are next year here and will wait for a vast majority of the population here to take the shots and this whole shit to calm down (which I doubt) and then they will just say it's not needed anymore.</p>
<p>Still, international tourism was a hobby of mine back in the day, guess I will probably never be doing it again (or at least for 7 years to come now)</p>

        <p>One of the great scandals of this pandemic is that, over 1 1/2 years into it, we still have no standard and effective treatment plan going.
If people go into the hospital, they only get bedrest, fluids, oxygen etc.</p>
<p>The only "official" thing we've learnt is that you shouldn't ventilate patients too early (which we should have known from the beginning), that a steroid from the UK might help, Ivermectin shows promise but the studies on it are slow...</p>
<p>Why is this happening?
Even if a treatment is evasive, why are we not seeing headlines all the time such as "pharmaceutical company X launches investigation into old/new antiviral treatment-"</p>
<p>I mean, if an new treatment was developed, surely they'd make a ton of money on it? </p>
<p>I personally highly doubt it is impossible to find some antiviral that helps, at least for cases in those who are not very elderly or if caught early.</p>
<p>I can only assume that some major type of financial corruption going on, or that there has been a lot of sunk cost fallacy with the vaccine by governments (e.g. "we've spent so much money paying for these shots, we'll use them, can't divert any more money out of the budget to research and development).</p>

        <p>The tell is that whenever a good prospect for treatment emerges (HCQ, IVM), no matter how safe it is they recommend to use it only in a trial and then only in a hospital. This is an effective ban on its use _or testing_ for early treatment. </p>
<p>This excessive caution with therapeutics is discarded when it comes to vaccines.</p>

        <p>I'm hoping some people here can provide some support or guidance with my situation. </p>
<p>I recently moved to New York City from a fairly suburban area upstate for work opportunities. I've been here since February, and as you might expect, things here kind of stunk for a while. It's gotten a lot better for the most part, but I'm getting a lot of pressure from my employer now over vaccination status, never mind that my medical history should not be their business in the first place. </p>
<p>We had an office-wide memo asking for proof of vaccination and now I basically have a target on my back from HR. Nobody else in the office really cares or asks, but we are constantly getting memos declaring how "safe and effective" they are (always in the same exact wording from the official propaganda), and that they want our entire staff to be fully vaccinated. </p>
<p>The concern is that there has been repeated mention of mandatory vaccines. I just moved here and I don't want to jeopardize my livelihood, but I'm also staunchly against the idea of getting a jab just for the reason that I'm getting pressured. I guess I need some people to keep me on track, tell me that I'll be okay and this is worth it</p>

        <p>Just some things I'd focus on in the same situation:</p>
<p>1) Shots are forever, you can't un-inject whatever went into your body. No research, no funding whatsoever goes into that. Their stance is "it's safe now and safe forever, no future research can ever discover otherwise" (logically impossible, but they will never, ever admit that)</p>
<p>1a) If you get the current vaccine, more than likely you and everybody else will be required to stay up to date with 3rd, 4th etc boosters. Once you're on the ride, why get off? You've already put it in your body at least twice, so you will have needlessly risked the integrity of your own immune system should you decide to refuse boosters at some point in the future.</p>
<p>2) This is just the first of many hurdles, and many of us have been prepared for it from the mask days (training wheels for vax passports). Short of a miracle or some kind of vaccine whistleblower (what major outlet would take them seriously?), the situation only gets more and more difficult from here, for refusers. Are you prepared for that? Are you prepared to go from office pariah, to fired, to potentially losing the vast majority of future job opportunities, and maybe the ability to shop in supermarkets? None of us know the exact future but those outcomes are already FAR from impossible.</p>
<p>3) If you refuse now, and perhaps lose quite a lot ... there still might be quite a long runway of time for you to change your mind, get vaccinated, and rejoin society. Everybody is going to evaluate that probable length of time differently, but I'd say we all have at least 1 year of total refusal left (some of that possibly in camps), before they revoke our ability to even change our minds. Because there are still a lot of people they will try to reach first (eg poor minorities), before they go full nuclear on us.</p>
<p>There are no easy answers with this. What if us Chicken Littles are right, and this really is something incredibly nefarious (like a depopulation mechanism)? Or, at the very least, "immune system as a service", where they are forcing people to be pharma clients for the rest of their lives, not just to participate in society, but maybe even to stay alive?</p>
<p>Nobody can tell you whether it will be worth it or not, because we don't know the future, and we don't know your personal values. How much are you prepared to lose, standing up for this one principle?</p>
<p>Crazy idea: pull a Jerry Maguire, stand up in the office, and loudly announce that you are unvaccinated and will remain so until they fire you. Say that if anybody else feels the same way, please get in touch so you can work against the policy as a group. Risky, but if you feel yourself close to getting fired, what would you have to lose? They'd be in the same boat.</p>

        <p>Great insights here. I wonder too about the underlying moral assumptions of others in this context.  Like when you say it could be an "incredibly nefarious" agenda, it implies that the evil and deception at work is beyond what most people are able (or willing) to conceive of. For most people here, I'm willing to bet that we are willing to conceive of greater evils and deceptions than most.  Or at the very least, we recognize the potential for inconceivable evil.</p>

        <p>You really gave me a lot to think about here, and some of it was really difficult to read because I don't want to think it can be true, but I think you're right. I'm already a bit of a pariah in my family, as everyone knows I'm the only one that didn't get it. And that's the thing, I HOPE I'm wrong about this, and that it's harmless. Everyone I love and care about has gotten it. But I also know in my heart I would regret giving in and getting this thing solely because of peer pressure. That's no basis to be making personal medical decisions off of and I couldn't in good conscience do that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's a crappy place to be either way, and I am really starting to realize there is no good choice to be made here.</p>

        <p>If they ask for personal medical information politely deny. If they descriminate based on that sue. When fired simply state that you feel like the real reason was your lack of provided vaccine status and are going to sue them. That might spare you some trouble.</p>
<p>Build your case now. Document the memos. See if you can legally record conversations and use them as evidence. Try to get stuff in writing as much as posssible. </p>
<p>Always stay polite and try to not burn bridges or rise suspicion. Give them a safe way out that maintains a good work relationship. Put some effort into networking within the company. You need to play the social game.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the advice! It would certainly seem like, based on my experience so far, that would be the only reason for termination, should it come to that. I have a good rapport with all my coworkers that I've met so far, so it'd be really blatant on their part if they did try to fire me over this.</p>

        <p>Hey, I’m from nyc too!!   I wouldn’t take the vaccine if I were you. If your employer is mandating that you take the vaccine tell them that according to EEOC federal laws they cannot force you.  Apparently NY can legally mandate vaccines for employees, but it has to be “reasonably related to the needs of the job”.  So for most office based jobs (I’m assuming you have an office based jobs)- the vaccine is not necessary. You can use this loophole to argue.<br>
I hope this was helpful and you can PM if you want anymore advice, it’s nice to meet someone in nyc that doesn’t want the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Truly and utterly demoralised. The constant propaganda and madness has finally gotten to me. The UK government had lied over and over again and not a single thing is done about it. I have absolutely no hope for the future. I live in a country where human rights aren't respected, the government lies with impunity, the government can legally commit crimes, can use children as agents of the state, where propaganda is everywhere 24/7, where nobody seems to care. Sorry for the rant but it seems the world as I thought of it is over.</p>

        <p>I have family members who are going to lose their jobs this week because the government is putting into law that all care workers must have the covid jab. They have no more freedom of choice... I'm vaccinated but I understand the hesitancy people have with this jab and don't think it should be mandatory. I am upset for them and angry that in the coming weeks thousands of care workers will leave the industry.</p>

        <p>I was going down the rabbit hole on Wikipedia and forgot about Typhoid Mary. How hard would it have been to have washed your hands? This woman really needed science to tell her that if you have shit and pee on your hands, you should probably wash your hands?</p>
<p>For four days, she was not allowed to get up and use the bathroom on her own.[25] The massive numbers of typhoid bacteria that were discovered in her stool samples indicated that the infection center was in her gallbladder. Under questioning, Mallon admitted that she almost never washed her hands. This was not unusual at the time; the germ theory of disease still was not fully accepted.[13][26]</p>
<p>Can you imagine dying due to eating shit?!     This is why I don't use hand dryers in bathrooms. There are feces particles in the air that ends up all over yourself. </p>
<p>People should be scared of typhoid, not Covid.</p>

        <p>Alone. Besides my kids who are under 12, I am the only one in my family to not be vaxxed. Having intelligent argument with people is basically impossible, being called either an idiot or selfish or some variation of an insult for not conforming to the new world ideals. I'm tired of the drama, I'm tired of the failure to meet societies expectations for my life. I'm tired of the sideways glances people give me when I argue for personal freedoms. I'm tired of social media, and I'm tired of the MSM, politicians, and global elite pushing their bullshit everywhere I look. I'm tired of having to dig for the truth. I'm 31 in August.. and I'm tired.</p>

        <p>It's gonna be alright, my friend. Try to be more subversive. Because we care, our inclination is to shout things form the rooftops and argue, but that does not change minds. Continue living your life in peace, ignore the fearmongering about the pandemic now that it is over. Flow like water. If you stay calm and patient, you stand a much better chance of slowly introducing to those who confront you the base of facts necessary to come to the same conclusions as you.</p>

        <p>Just want to give you all a shout out - Peace and Love!</p>
<p>I've noticed other people coming here just to vent about random stuff, because their ideas and viewpoints get them booted from other subs, not even really related covid.  And it seems everyone gives them tons of love, support, understanding, and an ear to listen.</p>
<p>I've also noticed people are very supportive about providing links.  If someone questions a comment I make, someone else will jump in and provide a link if I don't get to it first.  Or they randomly just respond with useful links.  So helpful and awesome.</p>
<p>And I've now been banned from 5 other subreddits having nothing at all to do covid or vaccines, just for participating on this subreddit.  It's complete insanity - trying to squash people's ability to think for themselves and kill off individuality and an intellectual mindset.  They will punish us for not being a sheep and not following the herd.  Now I can't tell people what a cute cat they have because I question and discuss the enforced government mandates restricting people's human rights.</p>
<p>So just want to tell everyone how awesome and intelligent you are, my fellow free-thinking, ostracized bunch.</p>

        <p>This is a dumb take. I've said this recently:<br>
There's a huge difference between somebody being oppressed because of the way they were born and somebody being oppressed for a decision they made, or continue to make, that they could, literally, change at any second.</p>
<p>Are unvaccinated being attacked? Yes.<br>
Is it because of the decisions they've made? Yes.</p>

        <p>&rt;We don't allow discrimination based on choices either.</p>
<p>Actually we do, and laws are a good, albeit heavy-handed, example.</p>
<p>If you make a choice to steal, murder, etc., you can definitely be held accountable for those choices.</p>
<p>Pro-vaccine people might argue you're putting others in danger because of your choices (akin to driving drunk, for example).</p>
<p>Anti-vaccine people might argue they're simply acting in "self-defense," of sorts—protecting themselves from other dangers.</p>
<p>In any situation (criminal, marriage, vaccination, etc.) you <em>chose</em> to do that. The only question that remains is which choices should be "punished" and which shouldn't.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Jewish people who suffered from the Holocaust did not choose to be in that group and it is certainly nothing like choosing to be vaccinated or not.</p>

        <p>Long before concentration camps became a thing, Jews <strong>could</strong> have chosen to renounce their Jewishness, could have converted to Christianity, could have renounced intellectual and financial professions in favor of blue-collar hard labor, etc.</p>
<p>It was a choice they made, continued to make, and could change at any second. Jewish culture was entirely elective (at odds with the society around them), not something built into their biology, therefore they were being needlessly stubborn and were entirely responsible for what happened to them.</p>

        <p>I disagree but I'm not going to get into a hopeless detour of a discussion about that.</p>
<p>My core point is that <em>it's not for other people to decide</em> - least of all, the angry mob stirred into a rage by 24/7 propaganda - what constitutes something essential to our identity, our way of life. The people who you think ought to "change any second" are those who deeply value a life without masks, perpetual lockdowns at the whim of unelected technocrats (or even elected leaders for that matter), and recurring compulsory injections (boosters etc) for the benefit of for-profit corporations with very poor track records and big dollar signs in their eyes.</p>

        <p>&rt;The people who you think ought to "change any second"</p>
<p>Where did I say you <strong>ought</strong> to change? I said you <em>could</em>, not that you should. Your decision is your own.</p>
<p>This is absolutely different from, for example, a person born of Jewish ethnicity, oppressed during the Holocaust, who, no matter how hard they pray, wish, or hope, could not change their genetic make-up.</p>
<p>As an example, if you were Christian, but you were forced, through a tyrannical regime, to choose: <br>
A. You renounce Christ and pledge to be an atheist.<br>
or<br>
B. Every other Christian on Earth, and their families, are tortured to death.</p>
<p>You <strong>could</strong> choose to renounce your religion, or not to, and each decision would come with a price.</p>
<p>But if you are Irish (ethnically) and a tyrannical regime said:<br>
A. Stop being Irish.<br>
or<br>
B. Every Irish person dies.</p>
<p>You do not have a choice.</p>
<p>This is what is being compared, and it's disgusting.</p>

        <p>I don’t know what country you’re in, but if you’re in the US, you are literally suffering no oppression by not getting vaccinated. If your job mandates it, then yes you might lose your job, but that is you making a decision that turns out badly for you. If your stance on vaccines makes you a social pariah, same thing. That’s not oppression and it’s definitely not genocide. That’s you making a decision others don’t agree with. It’s the very definition of freedom. Come on. How do you think that comparison would sound to people whose lives have been threatened or ended by regimes of power? Would you tell a survivor of South African apartheid that their experience is the same as yours?</p>
<p>I come here trying to understand your point of view, and I have empathy for many if not most of you. A pandemic is scary and adapting is uncomfortable and no one likes having to live through this but I don’t get how you can honestly make this kind of equivalence without being very ashamed of yourself. </p>
<p>And btw, I don’t agree with your point of view here, but if the government threatened your life for not getting vaccinated, I would protest for you. I would stand up for you.</p>

        <p>&rt; "Oh, sarcasm because obviously the Holocaust involved racial antisemitism, not religious antisemitism." </p>
<p>Here's some info which will help will help you understand that guy's analogy better. </p>
<p>&rt;According to the Nuremberg Laws, a person with three or four Jewish grandparents was a Jew. A grandparent was considered Jewish if they belonged to the Jewish religious community. Thus, the Nazis defined Jews by their religion (Judaism), and not by the supposed racial traits that Nazism attributed to Jews. </p>
<p>source: https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-nuremberg-race-laws</p>
<p>Also it's racist to assume that Jewish people are the same race.</p>

        <p>Is that why they distributed propaganda like <em>The Eternal Jew</em> which showed how to identify Jews by their <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/photo/part-of-the-der-ewige-jude-exhibition">external features</a>?</p>
<p>Even if I'm wrong, and it's not an ethnic group (which you should just look at wiki entry for <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews">"Jews"</a>), then my original point is still correct based on what you're saying:<br>
People did not choose to have grandparents who practiced Judaism, and therefore were not able to change their status as a "Jew."</p>

        <p>if your employer mandates vaccination, and you lie and tell them you went to a county run vaccine center, would they have any way of proving you a liar?

        <p>My uni announced they will go back to on campus classes after the semester break. But they demand everyone to get vaccinated or you have to pay 60 bucks per day for a covid test. They even announced that they will be offering vaccinations on campus during the semester break... Even the burger place next to uni is now offering vaccinations and giving you a discount if you get the jab there... Sometimes I think suicide is the only way out for me now.</p>

        <p>Oh look! Now you claim to speak for all the gods! I knew shills were arrogant but wow. </p>
<p>Also, refusing an experimental concoction which contains many unknown substances- a concoction that the manufacturers claim will hijack your body and cause it to produce spike proteins- spike proteins which the Salk Institute have shown will produce cardiovascular damage- refusing the said poison is... let me get this straight... "suicide"? Really. </p>
<p>When the manufacturers of the poison shots have immunity from all liability if their product kills you, which it already has done to tens of thousands of people that we know about. So trying to preserve your life from the death jab is, in your view, "suicide".</p>

        <p>According to the CDC, people under 50 have a miniscule chance of being hospitalized or dying from sars-cov-2 infection. Fewer than 400 children age 0-17 have died in the US over the entire pandemic.</p>
<p>Sorry kid, but I'm more worried about car crashes, RSV, and norovirus in me and my children than I am of covid. Especially considering all of us have already recovered from it and have antibodies or as proven by blood work.</p>
<p>It's ok kid, work hard, go to college, and you'll be able to digest peer-reviewed medical research someday.</p>

        <p>With the new variant created by self-important morons, over 20% of the new cases are children. And we don't yet know what the long term damage will be. Besides, we both know that you aren't concerned about those either, unless they happen to inconvenience you in some way.</p>
<p>That's the problem with losers trying to pretend to have a respectable streak in them, they are so far removed from respectability that they can't even manage to fake it.</p>

<p>Why do 50% of people who are getting the vaccine still getting the virus?</p>
<p>You don't know because you're either a) stupid b) misinformed or c) lying.</p>
<p>And while there's nothing wrong with falling under a or b, in fact in your case it's probably both, there <em>is</em> something wrong with lying and coming here with this haughty attitude like you and your shill buddies like to do.</p>

        <p>well son, they have over an 80 percent vaccination rate. as anyone who has even a grade school education knows, as the percentage of vaccinated people goes up, the number of people catching it while vaccinated also goes up. if for example, morons like you died off and 100 percent of the survivors were vaccinated then 100 percent of the people getting it would be vaccinated,it's just that that total number would be so much smaller than before.</p>
<p>now son, consider yourself lucky. I normally don't do charity work and someone as feeble minded as you could never afford my hourly rates, so do everyone a favor and keep your ignorance to yourself from now on, OK?</p>

        <p>My state has lifted all mask restrictions. Some places still have signs that request unvaccinated people to wear masks, but no one makes an effort to ask...so basically, masks are done here (for now).</p>
<p>This weekend I wanted to take my kid someplace fun. Found a children’s museum not too far away, so I looked into that until I read “All kids 5+ must wear masks” ummmm...HAHA. Nope. My kid isn’t even 5 yet but I’m not supporting such idiocy....AND they charge all ages, including the 1 year old baby who wouldn’t participate in anything. Evidently an overall trash place, totally off my radar now.</p>

<p>The masks that people by from gas stations and CVS are made of 100% cotton . Cotton absorbs droplets and still spread viruses that is why cotton masks are not used in any medical practice. </p>

<p>Big newspaper in my country says also vaccinated people spread the Delta variant. 
Other newspaper writes our 'outbreak management team' now advices the government to also have vaccinated people tested. 
Also big protests in France and UK against mandatory vaccines.</p>

        <p>Yes, the Guardian posted an article that the Delta is 'like a bad cold' for most people and that that is worrysome as people dont notice they have the rona and continue walking around with it and spread it. 
Really.. if this was a killer disease like Ebola where 1 out of 2 people died from the disease we would all be keeping to 'rules' without anyone needing to impose them on us.
The longer this takes I honestly sometimes feel we are part of a comedy show only no one is laughing at the jokes. Or may be some are but behind the screens.</p>

        <p>I went to the dermatologist today, not knowing that I'd need a mask for a consultation. Then the 'doctor' lectured me on how irresponsible of me not wearing mask without being vaccinated. I mentioned that I'm breastfeeding and until it's voluntary I choose not to take it.
I think she refused to treat me. At least this is what I got from her explaining how expensive and complicated the treatment would be, (simple removal) and directed me towards another person.</p>

        <p>Hi all, concerned skeptic here, I start my last year of college, and it was announced that all students were required to get the vaccine before being allowed on campus. My mother is also really emphasizing that I should get it. I really tried to wait as long as possible to get as much long term research out of the way. Looks like I don’t have a choice anymore. Is there any research on which one is the least likely to fuck my shit up? Definitely not JnJ</p>

        <p>Does your college allow for religious or personal exemption? As for your mother, that's a tough one. My parents backed off when I showed them the research that prior infections confer immunity. If you've had a positive covid test you should be good to go. If you haven't, go donate blood for a free antibody test or pay for one. If you have antibodies you are immune. I know a few people who never remember getting sick but have antibodies anyway.</p>

        <p>Oof dah... I've argued the same.  My stepmom is going on all about the Delta variant now... 'even if you had Covid, you can still get the delta and the vaccine protects against the Delta'.  I mean, I'm nearly 50 years old, take no daily pharmaceuticals, rarely take pills ever, almost never get sick, survived covid just fine the first time around... and I still get 'the Delta variant!  The Delta variant!'  Jeez, lady, lay off the twitter and MSM,... lol.  If I took away her phone and TV, she'd have no clue any of this Delta variant was even a concern and she'd probably be a much calmer person.</p>

        <p>As a physician, just get the vaccine. We have nearly a year of data on the vaccine at this point. If it makes any difference, I as well as my wife were one of the first people in the US to get it back in Dec 2020. Felt fatigued for 24 hours after the second dose, then went right back to feeling fine. Do not get your information from a cesspool of uneducated fools on this sub. It is literally an echo chamber of stupidity encouraging more stupidity. Almost everything here that is posted is not supported by any evidence, and they are instead cherry-picking at anything in a desperate attempt to justify their idiocy. People here may act like they know what they are talking about, but if you were to come visit an ICU and see the shit that happens to COVID patients, you would quickly realize that this sub is literally helping make this pandemic worse.</p>
<p>Again, as a physician, PLEASE get the vaccine and encourage others to do so. We are seeing surges in patient numbers that we haven't had in months now, likely due to the Delta variant. And &rt;90% of them are unvaccinated patients.</p>

        <p>My sister recently ratted out and lied to my mother saying that I don't believe covid exists. I said it does exists but the reaction is completely unjustified. Likely due to the fact that I refuse to take the vaccine and after that it's a rock solid no. Wouldn't be fucking surprised if she ratted me out to the police the moment it becomes socially acceptable.</p>

        <p>I recently found out that my mother-in-law - despite following almost every restriction/mandate to the best of her ability - didn't believe COVID exists until she supposedly caught it. On top of that, she also thought my husband and I don't believe COVID exists, despite our explicit insistence multiple times otherwise. "We never said it isn't real, we said it's blown out of proportion" at least once a month for the past year or so. She's also one of those people who will ask you a question but immediately start yapping to someone else before you have a chance to answer. Might have something to do with why she's chronically oblivious to who her son and I really are or what we really believe.</p>

        <p>Sharing an example of the utter impossibility of penetrating into an NPC's mind:</p>
<p>I had a long phone conversation with an old friend a few days back, talking about the whole previous year and things going on in the world today. I know it's hopeless but nonetheless couldn't resist telling the story of the WEF and how they were involved with Event 201, Klaus and the Great Reset, etc. Now this guy gets his entire worldview from NPR, eats it exactly as it's served up with no critical reflection whatsoever. Nonetheless I had nothing better to do so even started explaining about Cyber Polygon and speculating what the odds might be that this "simulation" turns into something less hypothetical in a few months, just like the "novel bat-originated coronavirus pandemic" of Event 201.</p>
<p>I also sent the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0oZA1B3ooI">WEF's own video</a> (now unlisted from Youtube), to see if he might make the connection for himself.</p>
<p>Sooooo, this was his response to that video today:</p>
<p>&rt;I am glad Trump is not still able to weaken our cybersecurity on behalf of Putin. I hope Biden does better.</p>
<p>It is hopeless. We are surrounded by literal robots. You cannot reach them, because their operating system is in "the cloud" (of broadcast media). Trying to point things out to them, is like trying to change the content of a TV show by fiddling with the picture settings.</p>

        <p>He doesn't want to be rude but he's not receptive to what you're saying because your methods have put him on the defensive.</p>
<p>Teaching is very, very hard. I recommend you wait. Be patient. At some point he will notice some inconsistencies for himself, or will say or do something that is very contrary to his character. For instance, he might agree with with nurses being fired for not taking the vax, but also be a big anti-corporatist and pro-worker's rights leftist. That will be the moment that you can very gently, very slowly start to peel the onion.</p>

        <p>"wE NEeD vAcCiNe MaNdAtEs!" Anyone that says this is anti science. Covid 19 has a 99.9% survival rate among the young and most deaths are people 70+. According to almost every study out there the true number of infected is way higher, meaning lots of people out there with antibodies, which means they dont need a shot. I know the branch covidans browse this sub, I just want to let you anti science morons know that a vaccine mandate wont come to the U.S, most people refusing to get the shot are POC so if you support a mandate you are a white supremacist :).</p>

<p>It drives me insane how little people with the proper mathematical background are actually able to realise the vast amount of manipulated data.</p>
<p>But then again, it does make sense, someone has to produce all the data. Worst part is, I dont believe they are all part of a conspiracy (some are), but rather they actually believe they are doing a proper job and therefor feel wrongly attacked when you critique their work.</p>

        <p>I was downvoted and banned from r/politics for saying exactly what the CDC said ( no data on autoimmune disorders but go ahead and take the jab, not collecting data on breakthrough cases unless hospitalized or dead). Then I said I trusted my immune system (gasp).</p>

        <p>It is not now, nor will it ever be, the place of government to create a "new normal" of any kind. The PEOPLE tell the GOVERNMENT what is normal. The corruption of the Technocrats has gone too far, and I'm honestly starting to struggle to retain a state of calm.</p>

        <p>I think it will be state by state in the US. I'm in Iowa and my state has banned mask mandates and all sorts of authoritarian restriction. As much as I dislike the Republican party, my Republican controlled state legislature is slam-dunking it on bringing an end to the fearmongering over Covid.</p>

        <p>I just went to go get a haircut from my barber who is unfortunately bought into the bullshit. He noticed I was still wearing a mask when I went in and asked why I haven’t gotten vaccinated. I told him it was my personal choice and I don’t believe the bullshit propaganda. He then went on to tell me that the reason why we will go into lockdowns again is because people like me and the experts are the one collecting the data blah blah blah.. sucks now because I don’t really feel welcome there anymore.. might have to start looking for a new barber..</p>

        <p>So Biden’s been talking about masking everyone again, including the vaccinated, because “we just can’t know who’s actually vaccinated. Hmm, what a pickle!”...This is their way of getting the masses to <em>ask</em>, if not <em>beg</em>, for vaccine passports, because half the vaccinated population probably only did so so that they can ditch their mask. Now it was pointless, and now they’ll welcome anything to “fix it”....</p>

        <p>FYI: if you want to know the true subscriber count of this sub, go check what they tell advertisers. </p>
<p>They manipulated the sub count of TD back in the day to make it appear far smaller than it was—easily about 10% of the true sub count, probably even less.</p>

        <p>Checked the advertising info—when you wanted to buy an ad, they advertised 6m subscribers, a opposed to 600k which is what was shown on the sub. When it was discovered and people started to get excited about it, Reddit went back and adjusted the number.</p>
<p>And if you compare the percent of active users at any given time, it’s more reasonable that the percent is genuinely on par with other subreddits, rather than  NNN for some reason having 50x more active users.</p>

        <p>Man, I just wish we could get to a point where we stopped lying to each other and misrepresenting ourselves, our actions, and our motives. We’re not even here for that long, why the fuck do we care what any of these guys say? </p>
<p>I’m tired of feeling like trust is naïveté. Tired of people justifying others’ lies as “smart business sense” or “protecting the public from themselves”.

        <p>It's very hard to live and speak an authentic, genuine life. Most of us let society lead us into doing things we're ashamed of, and then accept society's prescription that it is normal and healthy. It stops us from reaching out to other.</p>
<p>I feel you bro, the only thing we can do is accept our past mistakes, own them, and start living authentic, honest, moral lives that we don't have to be ashamed of.</p>

        <p>Tapeworms have been known to form cysts in the brains of their hosts (not just an intestinal parasite). Do you think it is a coincidence we are seeing such opposition to ivermectin? The parasites have an interest in controlling their hosts and covid is the ideal cover to get rid of the drug that risks wiping them out.</p>

        <p>Work on getting healthy. Go low/no carb (metabolic health is a big determinant of virus susceptibility and severity). Maybe do some research into ivermectin and shit and have something in place that allows you to get effective early treatment. Sleep well and get more sun exposure.</p>

        <p>On the site of Americas Frontline Doctors they state that mostly older people with a minimum of 2 or 3 health conditions have a high(er) risk of dying. 
I was most worried about my mom at the beginning of the so called pandemic as she had just had cancer treatment and had a similar disease (over reaction to pneunomia) a year before.
 Then she got Covid and only had a cold and a little fever. <br>
After that I stopped worrying about it. <br>
I am overweight but am healthy otherwise. I do work on loosing weight and getting healthier but as I hardly ever fall ill I think in any case I  am better off without the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I wouldnt mind skipping winter in my country either. :)
Age and health problems combined are the main  factors for severe ilness, when you just had a child you will probably be allright. 
Vitamine D levels should be good to battle Covid. If you live in a cold climate  you may want to take supplements for that. And vitamine C and Zink and Quercetine are supposed to help battle Covid aswell. 
I think in the beginning of the pandemic I had a mild form of Covid, my partner aswell. At that time we couldnt get tested. I took supplements C and Zink and when we felt a bit short of breath we used saline nose spray which gave immediate relief. (Viruses dont survive well in salty surroundings). 
I am not taking supplements at the moment but have them at home, in case I feel a cold coming up or feel low in energy. In winter I will use D as I won't get much sunlight here.</p>

        <p>I think this is outside the scope of this sub so I'm turning it into a rant: It seems like the FBI was behind the "plot" to kidnap Governor Whitless. </p>
<p>Article quote: </p>
<p>The anti-government extremist group accused of conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had been infiltrated by at least a dozen FBI informants — some of whom took leading roles in the scheme, BuzzFeed News reported. </p>
<p>At least 12 confidential FBI informants assisted the investigation into the extremist group accused of conspiring to kidnap the Democratic governor, according to the news outlet's report.  </p>
<p>An examination of the case by BuzzFeed revealed that "some of those informants, acting under the direction of the FBI, played a far larger role than has previously been reported."</p>
<p>For example, an Iraq war veteran informant "became so deeply enmeshed in a Michigan militant group" that he rose to second-in-command of the group, BuzzFeed reported. </p>
<p>The war vet told members of the group to convene with other potential suspects and even paid for members' transportation to meetings, according to the news outlet.</p>

But being someone who’s been advised that I shouldn’t be jabbed since I’ve reacted negatively to the flu V, tdap V and an mRNA therapeutic called Aimovig, I’m considered high risk with the C jab. Still yet, some admonish me for not getting it. What about those of us who can’t?! Acting like this is ones size fits all is obvious Bull shit propaganda and has led me to question it entirely!</p>

        <p>I’ve heard that of course. But how can that be when it’s forced upon me as well? So hypothetically, if I lived in Italy, I would be forced to take it at my demise because they aren’t giving Green Passes to those who are medically excluded. It’s being pushed on everyone. MAJOR red flag to me. But it’s good to know, or else I may have remained a “sheep”.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure that’s what my son’s dad had the second time since he tested positive during an outbreak right after Delta got “bad” in our area. </p>
<p>First time he had COVID he basically had a bad cold. Second time he was completely asymptomatic. He’s almost 40 but in really good health so I’m not surprised. The only people I’ve known to become seriously ill were the type of people I’d worry about catching the flu.</p>

        <p>I'm so envious about mass protests in other countries. In this shitty sheep land those wouldn't summon a thousand. People here are happy to comply and take the fastest route to peace without wondering if it will even last. Doesn't matter if we get one of the 5 most restrictive policies in the world, as long as people are given a path to "cheat the system a little", they'll eat it up. The only time protests got really massive was when they had full support of the media, elites and even some plants at this weak ass government. A big display full of nothing, just an empty "we want change, we don't know what or why but we want change" as an excuse to start the process of dismantling the country and its symbols -which is now in progress-.</p>
<p>Yesterday in a family reunion I got a mini "intervention" to get the jab. My brother in law said he understands my position, he knows this show is full of lies, he knows it's all corrupted to the core, but tried to talk me into "reducing the probabilities" - even if they're already low, and he understands they're ridiculously low, he'd let pass anything shady as long as death probabilities reduce from 0.0002% to 0.00015%, he'll take it. Just to be in peace.</p>
<p>My position isn't even anti-vax - don't even intend to "never get jabbed", I just want to do it (or not) in my own terms, whenever I'm arsed to. And particularly extortion makes me not being arsed.</p>

        <p>Comment #1000</p>
<p>The latest wave of propaganda from NPR is here and it's terrifying.</p>
<p>I want to tell you about the propaganda I heard on NPR a few hours ago. They were first of all saying if you've been infected or if you're vaccinated mainly they said even if in fact you've been infected it doesn't mean you're not going to get the disease and spread the disease especially those Delta variants and they also said that you could even get <strong>symptomatic disease</strong> if you've already been infected and because of this politicians should tell their constituents to get the vaccine, just get the vaccine. </p>
<p>One side of the show was saying okay how are you going to tell people to tell Everyone to get the vaccine -- you have to say "get the vaccines, stupid" and then he said yeah get the vaccine or "you're dumb" because you're dumb not to get the vaccine now you're even a "pendejo" which in Spanish is basically translated to f<strong>*</strong>* idiot as it's a literal curse word and I was shocked that they said it on the air! Oh this is only in PUBLIC that you should do this. Oh but in private you have to be showing love like I did with my father... he then gave his story how he convinced his father. </p>
<p>They all claimed the unvaccinated will be responsible for "massive outbreaks" but one journalist said that she never was able to convince anyone by starting a conversation saying "hey you're an idiot and here's why"... The guy disagreed and said no they SHOULD be saying they are stupid in PUBLIC for being unvaccinated.</p>
<p>So even if you DO have natural immunity you are still stupid for not getting vaccinated!</p>

        <p>Bruh I told my parents about the myocarditis that’s showing up in people my age after the 2nd Pfizer injection (regardless of how rare it might be), especially considering the fact that I have a health condition (which does not put me at much higher risk with the coof than average people, but could put me at higher risk if I were to suffer myocarditis).</p>
<p>They still said to take the Pfizer vaccine as soon as I possibly can. </p>

        <p>To the side? If you’re a stoner or a vaper you can put a mask on and blow the smoke out and literally watch what happens to your breath. It expels out the edges of your mask and kind of sits around your head. Which if you’re 6ft apart from someone, it’ll never touch them. Yay for experiments! Almost like science can be tested. Weird, huh?</p>
<p>Just in case you need a step by step for this one. </p>
<ol>
<li>Take whatever smokeable thing you want, cigar, weed, vape, you name it.
2 with no mask on, blow it straight out. </li>
<li>Observe how far it goes. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now, mask on. </p>
<ol>
<li>Smoke the smokeable of your choosing</li>
<li>Blow it out just the same way</li>
<li>Observe how it goes nowhere near your first trial did.</li>
<li>Stare in amazement as reality shatters</li>

        <p>You don’t have to believe it. It’s literally testable. Do it yourself. I’ve given you 2 ways you can test the effectiveness of masks. And it’s not like I made those 2 up off the top of my head. They’ve been used to show mask effectiveness for over a year now. </p>
<p>If you go by the guidelines: 6ft apart and wear a mask, then yeah the odds any covid gets to you via someone else directly talking to you is next to 0.</p>
<p>I’d love to see you do these tests and film it. I want to see the reaction on your face when you realize masks work</p>

        <p>I mean yeah, you're not presenting some groundbreaking concept here, and it's actually quite telling that you <em>think</em> you are. If two people sit motionless 6ft apart with masks on and there's no air current, then obviously their breath won't get far from their respective mouths. I don't think <em>anyone</em> you've ever spoken to about masks would deny that.</p>
<p>&rt;If not then why aren’t you at least giving a rebuttal</p>
<p>I'm more interested in seeing if you can think of other forms of social interaction where masks wouldn't help in spite of what you just said above. But it seems like you can't. I'm not surprised.</p>

        <p>Nope, glad you admit that wearing a mask and standing 6 feet apart works. Seems you admitted you’re wrong on that account. I’ll name off some activities you couldn’t do with a mask and 6 feet. </p>
<p>A mask prevents nothing, except for having a beer chugging competition in a packed room or something. </p>
<p>The 6ft part would only prevent you from doing a handful of tasks. The fact that I actually had to think of things you can’t do while 6ft apart shows how little things there are that you can’t do. But I guess an example of one would be making out with strangers lmao. Or boxing/combat sports. But even then you should know your sparring partner and be aware of their illness status. </p>
<p>Another example may be something like rollercoasters, assuming they don’t have seats sectioned off. But essentially all of those are non-necessities. You won’t die if you can’t do them. If you want the perks of being able to do those things, then get vaccinated. If you refuse to get vaccinated then don’t bitch when people don’t want to do those things with you.</p>
<p>Clearly you have a task that you feel you’re not allowed to do and it’s making you upset. So spit it out. What’s the thing ruining your life?</p>

        <p>&rt; Seems you admitted you’re wrong on that account</p>
<p>Lol no I didn't. But again, I'm not surprised that you would assume this from what I said. Selective reading and gaslighting is a hallmark of your ilk.</p>
<p>&rt;Clearly you have a task that you feel you’re not allowed to do and it’s making you upset</p>
<p>I'm an anti-masker remember? I don't limit myself. So how can you also believe this? Sounds fishy. Sounds like someone making up stuff in accordance to what they were programmed to believe again. Sorry, I'm not buying your fake arrogance here, this smells like cope.</p>

<p>You literally asked for examples of tasks that you can’t do with 6ft apart and masks. I can’t think of a single necessity that you’re limited from. And on top of that, I can only think of a handful of recreational activities you’re not allowed to participate in. So there goes that argument for you. Unless you have a list of critically important activities you can’t do</p>

        <p>“I already accepted that your ‘test’ is right” after saying masks don’t work. So yeah, considering my tests proved the effectiveness of masks, I’d say that’s you admitting you were wrong. But hey, it’s ok to be wrong. Don the so upset about it</p>
<p>I asked you for examples but you won’t give any. So I guess you can’t think of any either🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p>People can do what they want. Do you ask every masked person if they’ve been vaccinated?</p>
<p>And if so many do that, then why are you guys all so ashamed of wearing masks? “Oh but if I wear a mask they’ll assume I’m unvaccinated and that’s a target on my back”. Why would they assume that if millions are vaccinated and still wearing masks?</p>
<p>My area is highly vaccinated, which is super surprising tbh because I live in a red state that has been red for as long as I’ve been alive. So yeah, when everyone around you is protected, nobody needs to wear masks. Life has been great. Bars all opened with no capacity restrictions, all businesses are back and booming, and everyone is friendly and eager to chat. Life has been incredible these last 6 months. Only place I had to wear a mask at was a doctors wellness visit.</p>

        <p>&rt;What’s your pre-existing condition.</p>
<p>Great question. Because if there is none, then masks are completely useless, as the WHO itself says:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200402-sitrep-73-covid-19.pdf">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200402-sitrep-73-covid-19.pdf</a></p>
<p>"There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases who are truly asymptomatic, <strong>and to date, there has been no documented asymptomatic transmission.</strong> This does not exclude the possibility that it may occur."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is what you people dont get. Its not about wearing a mask, its about all the lies and bs accompanied with it. Now tell me, is what I just posted News to you? If so, why? Why would you think you can spread a disease, when you cant? Something that was known and accept pre-covid, but somehow changed during covid, eventho there is no, zero, none scientific evidence to back it up?</p>

<p>They're blaming the unvaccinated for the current cases... but if anyone can spread covid regardless of whether they're actually sick, then the jabbed/unvaxxed distinction shouldn't matter.</p>

        <p>There is no asymptomatic spead. Even a simple google search can confirm this. First google result:</p>
<p>LOL okay... I dont get the same results as yesterday anymore...</p>
<p>But the WHO pdf is still up:</p>

        <p>From what I understand (I'm not totally clear myself tbh), the "vaccine" allegedly will reduce the severity of the symptoms of Covid but not actually stop it. This is why imo one shouldn't have to get vaccinated. Offered? Okay I don't care, but not mandatory (my body, my right).  I've said this before but if this is all real in the end and I get it an get sick and possibly die, it's on me and not on anyone else. For something with a 98.whatever %  recovery rate, I'll risk it. The majority of the people (don't have the number), were asymptomatic especially if they were young and not obese.</p>

<p>Yeah, I get your point that it's just words but the problem is that they are often just trying to provoke people and sometimes it's dumb stuff that we can laugh at but the higher level ones are good at pushing the right buttons and it toxifies threads and the chaos not only causes more work for me, it opens us up more for attack for a number of reasons.  /runonsentence</p>

        <p>Has anyone seen any peer-reviewed research on Ivermectin as a cancer treatment that included a dosing regimen? I see 68 mcg per lb as a single dose for antihelminth treatment in mammals including humans, but I'd like to take some preliminary research when I discuss things with my father's oncologist.</p>

        <p>NVM I got it. Found a great overview that included some dosing regimens, typically 200 mcg per kg per week for 6 weeks, bit it varies a lot based on the studies. Can't wait for it to be explored more! There's a few studies coming out of China that show high efficacy against renal cell carcinoma without damaging good kidney tissue, which is exactly my father's situation.</p>

<p>I really thought that long term went longer than 3 months! I’d probably say 1- 10 years is long term ? (but probably by 2 years it’s too late to do anything so it just gets swept under the rug?/ or we will all be dead so it won’t matter?)</p>

        <p>Got the first jab in April Bc I fell victim to the hype…yeah I know. I should have found this sub sooner. Felt fine not getting the 2nd but the Delta hype has me again worried….thankfully this sub is here to calm me down. 41, decently good shape, had heart surgery when I was a kid but otherwise healthy (it was to repair a VSD)…Heart scan in late 2019 was perfect…I’m not getting the 2nd shot bc of all the shit I’m seeing with this, and I have 3 young kids and don’t want to get something I’ll die from or night cripple me. Taking zinc, beet root, and vitamin D daily. Any other supplements people might recommend??</p>

        <p>I’ve found delta 8 which helps a ton. I’m in Indiana so no legal weed and funny enough I haven’t smoked since college (and only 3 times then)…but D8 is great stuff. It’s helping me wean off benzodiazepines I’ve been on for anxiety for a decade….</p>

        <p>Hey, whatever calms your nerves! Personally, I'd rather stick with the flower even if it was still illegal here, but what matters is what works for you and your situation. My husband and I supposedly might've had the rona back in May, but I know the reason we felt so sick for so long is the stress from his family harassing us and even threatening us because of it. It probably would've been no worse than a bad cough and mild fever for maybe a week or so if we hadn't spent the next couple months enraged and in fear. Even then, the bulk of our sickness was simply a general sense of unwellness that blended nicely with the sleep deprivation and dehydration, ultimately fading away as we began to care for ourselves a bit better. Of course the hysterics will say we got "long COVID" lol</p>

        <p>Haha I get kinda paranoid when I haven't smoked in awhile and I overestimate my tolerance. Especially if I start wondering how noticeable it might be to certain people or if I fixate on some random unpleasant bodily sensation. I totally get that it isn't always so calming as some folks would like to believe!</p>

        <p>Quercetin with the zinc is supposed to be even more effective, that's what I use. Then get some Ivermectin for back up if you ever start to develop symptoms. Get it now so you have some on hand for earliest possible treatment.</p>

        <p>I dont know it, but I do know for the so called Green pass they do not accept all vaccines. So if you want to take it for more freedom, better inform about that first.</p>

        <p>Not in your situation and obviously I don't think you should take the vaccine however it is all about what you feel comfortable with. It sounds like you have a lot stress about how others see you or will treat you, this is not the best way to assess whether you should get the shot or not. You need to own your own decisions. The question is do you think you should get the vaccine and are you willing to accept any side effects because no one else will need to deal with that except you. Myself I would gladly wear the mask until the cows come home before I take the shot(s), Although I am hoping I won't have to forever.</p>

        <p>My situation’s pretty similar! I have pressure from both sides through different family members. I was supposed to go back to university in the fall but decided to just graduate so I didn’t have to deal with all the requirements. I keep feeling like, man, I should just get this vaccine &amp; have it over with, but I’m concerned the vaccine would have more severe consequences for me down the line than a potential covid infection would. I was originally going to get it too. You’re so far from alone &amp; I hope things get easier for you soon. Just remember there is no right or wrong decision &amp; no matter what you decide, you are a strong person for facing all the facts before making a decision. :)</p>

        <p>So you don’t have a pre-existing condition. You’re just worried about what the vaccine will do later on. Why lie?</p>
<p>There’s definitely a right decision. If he’s capable of getting the vaccine he should. If the government wanted to kill millions they’d kill then people who don’t listen to them. Not the sheep. If anything, the government will drop a gas bomb and kill everyone except for the vaccinated people, who got a vaccine that makes them immune to the gas. Now that’s a conspiracy if you want to look at it from a realistic conspiracy “killing people off” point of view.</p>

        <p>Helps others who can’t get it. Same reason wearing a mask was highly encouraged. Also it doesn’t hurt. It’s free, don’t need good health insurance or anything, and it helps prevent you from getting sick and having to lock yourself up for 2 weeks</p>

<p>I said your friend can wear a mask and distance. Or better still take vitamin d look after his health and I'm sure hell be fine. But sure as shit don't force everyone else to be injected due to a bad deal at birth. Life isn't perfect.</p>

<p>My friend didn’t force anyone to do anything. Nor did any of us get vaccinated for them. You simply said “everyone can get it?” And I answered telling you that no, some can’t. You’re making up an entirely new argument that I never even said. Don’t know where you’re pulling all this from but it’s hilarious</p>

You seem to think taking a vaccine is a completely benign and safe activity which is disingenuous based on vaers and yellow card data alone. You also seem to think this virus is an automatic death wish when the ifr consistently says otherwise.</p>

        <p>Site got a visit from Ontario Ministry of Labor today. Can’t say I’m surprised that they’ve been handed a special script geared towards tradies. Spoiler alert, it includes passive aggressive threats of violence to the unvaccinated. Really wanted to get into it with him but arguing with a government employee who has jurisdiction over my workplace is pretty much a guaranteed lose-lose. He saw me watching/listening to his monologue with a couple other guys and asked if I wanted in on this “conversation”. I said nah I’m good, I don’t talk politics at work.</p>

        <p>Sorry you had such a miserable birthday. These are tough times indeed for people not going along in the general narrative. It may take a while still but I am pretty sure at some point we will be proven right and may be not all but some will feel ashamed of their behaviour towards so called 'antivaxxers'. In any case your body and soul will be thankful for your choice for natural health.</p>

I don't have any sources at my fingertips but I'm sure you can find lots of articles the problem being whether the numbers can be reliable depending on how they are presented and where they are from.</p>

        <p>How is posting on an online forum "trying to force religion on you"? You say "don't be annoying" but it seems like you're annoyed by discussions of religion that don't even involve you, like this one didn't until you interjected yourself.</p>

        <p>&rt;A construct created to bring order to people</p>
<p>&rt;oldest form of said mandates </p>
<p>The beautiful thing about God is that to the very core of Christian theology, it’s about free will. Faith is necessary to be in a relationship with God and for good reason; if you loved someone so much, but you forced them to be in your presence at all times and gave them no other choice, would that be a loving relationship? No, that’s tyranny.</p>
<p>People have used Christianity to fulfill their own desires for domination, evil and power, but that doesn’t change who God says he is. He is the way, the truth, and the life, and I don’t know if you’re implying you don’t believe any order exists, but I believe there must be an objective truth to what ought to be, what is right and what is just. </p>
<p>If you say objective truth doesn’t exist, <em>is that true?</em> If you say you don’t know if objective truth exists, are you 90%, 95%, 100% sure you don’t know if there’s an objective truth?  If the answer is yes only 95% sure, is that true? Is it true you don’t know? Point here is, objective truth does exist.</p>
<p>No ones forcing you to be with God, including God himself. He wants you to come to him on your own, like the prodigal son. I don’t know where you get the idea of a mandate or something used to control the masses.</p>
<p>&rt;pretending to be against mandated ideologies from big gov</p>
<p>When did I say I think the government should FORCE people to say they believe in God? I deeply desire everyone to experience the peace and joy that comes with understanding the Good News, but no part of my faith includes mandating people to comply with my own morality. Please feel free to ask me more questions but I’d love to hear your response to this too</p>

        <p>I gotta say before I forget, just had hilarious argument with Karen on FB.</p>
<p>Obviously in reply to a guy that there is so many selfish people who don't care about global plandemic blabla, I replied with picture that was posted on this sub, that we're selfish? For being forced with lockodown, destroying businesses, experimental injection. </p>
<p>Of course I mentioned Macron lunacy and authoritarian regime, that even police and hospitals joined the people.</p>
<p>She went on rant to me that she has degree in Nuclear and Chemical something, that I shall not call her 🐑🐑, and that she checked my feed is full of fantasy and gaming stuff... 🤣🤣 Listen I am dangerous right wing conspiracy theorist and I should never talk to her again. I only replied "Ok Karen".</p>
<p>Ohhh man... And following that I wanted to screencap this but she removed all the comments lol</p>

        <p>The only sub I have banned from that I cared about is  the 49ers sub after I was calling for somebody to take out the Seahawks receiver with a shot to the dome.</p>
<p>Whatever though.  I played many years of football and not once did I ever intentionally use my helmet as a weapon because that's not what they teach you.</p>
<p>It was in the context of my general belief that concussion protocol creates a perverse incentive to do that in addition to my consumption of alcohol at the time.  Sorry Mr. Metcalf, you were too good that day and would have won the game anyways.</p>

        <p>I'm trying to start post-secondary education, but my dad is threatening to not let me go if I don't get vaxxed. I would appreciate some reputable sources that show that the vaccine is not as safe as the news says, as well as some sources that show that the virus is not as dangerous as the news says.</p>

        <p>Go to the VAERS website.  Familiarize yourself with it. Deaths, serious adverse reactions etc....Also, visit @darkhorse podcast on Odysee.com. Bret and Heather Weinstein are both PhD's, evolutionary science. They have been on the scientific deception for a very long time now.. You Tube demonitized their video for asking vaccine related scientific questions.  Pick an episode you'd like him to watch. Best!!!! Dr. P Corry, Dr. Von Isb.....Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Robert Malone  (spelling?) <br>
ALSO go to FLCCC website. Very informative.  Best!!!!!</p>

        <p>Don't bother. In all likelihood, school will shut down by the end of October anyway. Things are already moving in the direction of more lockdowns, and it's the middle of summer. Anyway, arguing the facts is probably a waste of time. You don't need him to agree with your decision, you need him to understand that he doesnt get a say in it. Calling his bluff is your best move here. When parents are domineering, the last thing they want is for you to get out from under their thumbs. Once he believes you'll actually skip college and move out rather than get the shot, he'll change his tune. Like I said, your better off taking next year off anyway since there's pretty good odds that they go to distance learning again anyway.</p>

        <p>had a thought today:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At least in the US, the most covid crazy + HCW were the first to line up for shots. HCW, understandable, but the covid crazy were lining up in like, february to get shots with all the elderly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the most covid crazy, unlike HCW, don't get repeat exposures to covid as they rarely leave their house</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vax immunity vs infection and mild disease generally wanes within 6 mos, but is typically strengthened via exposure to the virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meaning, the most covid crazy are thus likely, compared to the general populace, to have waning immunity (no later exposures, earlier vax date)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus most breakthroughs are gonna be the covid crazies in this country within the next 3 mos.</p>
<p>Am ready w the popcorn when the phenomenon begins in full</p>

        <p>Expect a new buzzword to be deployed to keep the vax’s sterling reputation intact. You will never hear the msm use the term ‘Vax Failures’. You need to keep giving the Branch Covidians rhetoric to spew at the non-believers. Admitting failure of any kind is not an option.</p>

        <p>Freedom of speech does not apply to private businesses like Facebook. Anyone who spends thirty seconds thinking critically about this will understand this. It's Facebook's house and you have to play by their rules or leave. If you want freedom of speech then make a sign and go stand on a corner because that's all the constitution provides you with.</p>

        <p>. If you know anything about the history you wouldn’t trust our govt period. No question about that.if you knew anything about anything you would trust the cdc or the fda and let’s not start with the federal reserve but yup we dumb.. and for the record we ain’t anti vax we anti covid vax..we anti force vaccination because we should have the freedom to chose what goes in our bodies right or you don’t agree with that?</p>

        <p>You definitely do have your freedumb, there's no doubt about that.</p>
<p>Not once did I mention the government in my list of sources that I trust. You are saying I shouldn't trust the government but I SHOULD trust the CDC or the FDA? Maybe that was a typo. Again, you're failing to be convincing here. One of the arguments in here is that you shouldnt get the vaccine because the FDA hasn't approved it, yet you don't trust the government anyway so who cares.</p>
<p>There is no mandate right now and in the USA there never will be. I learned that from one of my sources that I trust, in this case it was a radio program. They had a lawyer on and discussed how likely it would be for a mandate to happen across the country and it's not at all likely. But you're scared it will and you're against something that hasn't happened. It doesn't sit right with me to force people to get medicine, but if those people won't stop going out into the world and infecting others and causing more deaths then they should be held responsible in some way.</p>

        <p>I work for UCLA and they are telling us get the vaccine or get fired. I got till September 9th..I think it’s a scare tactic but we’ll see..</p>
<p>Question is since you all about history. Do you trust the govt? Cdc? Fda? Federal reserve? You can bribe any of these guys with money. 100 percent facts.</p>

<p>\&rt;See CNN headline on facebook that says something like "Vaccines give more protection than natural immunity</p>
<p>\&rt;Repeat ad-nauseam, believing that you're "know a lot about covid" and you're "following the science"</p>
<p>\&rt;Never realize the intricacies of the research, like the fact that natural and vaccine both provide a neutralizing level of antibodies, and the fact that a the vaccine produces more antibodies is meaningless</p>

        <p>Technically I was assuming your friends' positions but okay, that's a fair response. My reply to you was sincere though, best reason to ditch social media. There are many other reasons completely unrelated to COVID as well though. You'll stop feeling like you're in a competition with your peers to always have the best looking life. You'll stop being emotionally manipulated by a heavy flow of doom and gloom style news reporting. You'll think about your own life a lot more and other peodples' a lot less. Good luck!</p>

        <p>Not always. I am banned from at least 15, but I never received a single notification. </p>
<p>It's harder to tell if you're banned if you use the mobile app since it still allows you to write a post. You just can't submit it. </p>
<p>If the list of moderators is missing for the sub under 'About', then it means that the sub has banned you.</p>

        <p>Dear Reddit Staff:</p>
<p>FUCK OFF WITH YOUR APP AND YOUR R/POPULAR! </p>
<p>Ahem....anyway, I'm really kinda hoping my neighbor tries to start some shit. Why? No clue, because I previously thought of him as the "good" neighbor. Maybe that's why: because I'm realizing I'd rather my neighbors be literal crackheads who have no room to talk - like the neighbors on the other side of the house - than some fucking goody-two-shoes who's all about The Rules and The Law. My husband and have had a rough couple months between his mother being hospitalized, her COVID hysteric siblings harassing us the entire fucking time, my mom injuring herself, and the housework/yardwork we've neglected. In particular, not tending to my gardens or allowing myself to enjoy them is hitting me pretty damn hard. There's been a fair share of slamming doors, chucking burnt chicken outside, tossing cases of water across the yard because every fucking package at Sam's was already ripped anyway, etc. And I'm just hoping for some insane reason that Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes next door is dumb enough to voice a question or comment so I can peacefully run him out of town to maybe go live with his drunk whore children. He met my mother once when she banged on his door hunting me down like a bad animal, so maybe he'll realize the manchineel doesn't fall too far from the tree.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I did wrong. I was actually trying to help. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I've struggled with insomnia before, thought it was fair to point out the obvious.</p>

        <p>If my husband and I put one of those "no soliciting" signs on our front door, would that maybe keep the "community outreach" people away when they come around to push the vaccine?</p>
<p>And also all the people pushing ivermectin/hydroxychloroquine come across as no less suspicious than those pushing the vaccine. Either way, it makes COVID out to be a bigger problem than it really is.</p>

        <p>Mostly people were already nearing the end of the average life expectancy or who already had a shorter life expectancy than average. On top of the usual 50+ million deaths and 100+ million births. Maybe I'd care more if it actually made a dent in the global population or posed a greater threat to young healthy people with their whole life ahead of them.</p>

        <p>I apply the same logic to both: I honestly don't care either way so long as you don't tell me or my loved ones what to put in our bodies. No one cares nearly as much about total strangers or even acquaintances as they think they do. We are physically incapable. Our brains have a limited capacity for genuine respect and compassion because they are of a finite size with a finite number of neural connections. And I'm more bothered by disability than death anyway. Everyone dies someday but not everyone has to be a cripple in the meantime.</p>

        <p>It’s weird and ridiculous that I have to argue for morals and ethics. Yes, I want people to get vaccinated so that it helps keep others alive longer. I didn’t get vaccinated for myself, I got vaccinated because it’s simply the right thing to do for the benefit of others. </p>

        <p>Dear Facebook Family,</p>
<p>Today I went onto Reddit and found this tragic little place called “No New Normal”, as if they think Covid is some kind of hoax! Well, you know me how I’m always trying to help people, so I went in there to try and educate these people because they probably just aren’t very informed. I went in there with the purest intentions (well maybe I was a little snarky) to try and educate them, for the sake of us all. You would not believe how rude and standoffish the people there were! I couldn’t believe the pushback I got when o was just trying to help! It was almost like they were mocking me and thought I was a joke. Well rest assured I won’t give up trying to help people and continue my crusade to annoy the absolute living-shit out of anyone that doesn’t adhere to my narrow scope of consciousness.</p>
<p>Until next time Fam!
NiceLady</p>

        <p>Just so you know, a lot of people aren't here to be in an echo chamber, it's to be <em>away</em> from <em>other</em> echo chambers.</p>
<p>I get sick of seeing comments calling unvaccinated people idiots or videos of people not wearing masks or COVID deniers dying from COVID and all that shit, and <strong>I'm</strong> vaccinated.  </p>
<p>Many people are here to find like-minded people not to reaffirm their own beliefs, but just to get away from all that crap.</p>
<p>You can change things with respectful conversation.. well, you may not be able to since you seem to use a moral high ground approach which automatically causes anyone (including me) to not take you seriously. But it <em>is</em> possible to change minds, just don't be a yutz about it.</p>

        <p>Bold of you to assume simply keeping people alive longer is so objectively moral and ethical. Some would argue than allowing the elderly and chronically/terminally ill to die with dignified palliative care rather than burdening the youth with caretaking responsibilities and overcrowding-related issues would be a tad more kind. But you're right, this is such an echo chamber! That's exactly why I get lectured and downvoted by the quiver-full folks here when I say we're overpopulated: because we all agree with each other on everything!</p>

        <p>Hmm, okay. I’ll rephrase and put it this way: It is wrong to kill conscious people (or those capable of consciousness) who want to live or very avoidably being responsible for their deaths. Old, weak, unhealthy or not. To suggest any different is weird and ridiculous. </p>

        <p>We aren’t going to find common ground if you think that some lives are more valuable or worthy of existence than others, at any stage. Correct me if I’m phrasing that incorrectly.</p>
<p>Also of course there is a difference between, let’s say, shooting someone and killing them vs indirectly causing the death of someone. In the situation we are discussing, however, both are avoidable in a serious way by not shooting someone, and getting a vaccination.</p>

        <p>You are making the argument that my choice not to get vaccinated (because I have natural immunity), I am putting the vaccinated, high-risk, and elderly patients at risk. It does not make sense. If they are vaccinated, they are not at any greater risk regardless of my vaccination status. </p>
<p>If you want to make the argument that it is more likely to infect me, then you are suggesting that we have to completely eradicate the virus from the environment or find a way to completely prevent infection, both of which are impossible because the current vaccinations do not prevent infection or transmission. </p>
<p>I also think that your egalitarian viewpoint of the value of life is not how society works and you know it. The newborn infant and the geriatric in hospice have two distinct calculations going into their healthcare decisions, and to pretend that you would treat both the exact same is simply an admission that you do not think about the subject with any nuance.</p>

        <p>This is incorrect.</p>
<p>This is incorrect as well. If you actually care about sources, I can provide them. Very abundant and very easy to find however (so I admittedly might just decide that you’re being facetious if you ask for them).</p>
<p>You both keep misconstruing what I’m saying in a convenient manner to fit your arguments. The terminally ill in hospice care or the incredibly old are not who I’ve zeroed in on. That’s what you two have done presumably because it feels like a ‘gotcha’. There are many different groups of people (young and old) who are more susceptible to serious illness and/or death due to COVID. My argument is that it’s wrong and incredibly selfish to ignore that. I also never implied that one should give the same kind of care to a baby as they would an elderly person. What?</p>

<p>That is the basis of my statement. Some lives are more valuable than others at some stages, and a good example is that a newborn has more value to society than a geriatric in hospice care. I understand what you are trying to say, so we can agree to disagree.</p>

        <p>I can understand your logic.  You want "goodness" in the world.  I do too.  But to what end?  Why doesn't our government care about diabetes like they do this pandemic?  Pandemic is a scary word isn't it?  I am a community health major and it has nothing to do with mortality.  A pandemic is referred to when a disease has transmitted to a certain amount of countries.  It also depends on the transmissibility.  Yes, it is easily transmissible like the flu and cold.   Still, it isn't highly deadly.  Just like the flu and cold.  It does have a higher rate than the flu and cold by a bit because it is new and people do not have immunity against it yet, but in the grand scheme, not that much more.  The thing that gets me is the underlying print.  The 98% survival rate.  The adverse effects from the vaccine being suppressed.   Doctors being suppressed.  Actual real doctors that **were** once respected in their field.  Dr. Peter Mccullough being one of the most published cardiologists out there.  Now being suppressed because his observations do not match those of the establishment.  The fact that there are studies on mrna vaccines that cause immunopathology in the animal subjects.  We are now seeing that in people.  The fact that the companies making these vaccines are not the most reputable companies; check out their histories - yikes.  I'm just saying, we have our reasons as do you, and both are valid.    </p>
<p>If I'm saying misinformation, I want to know!  I want people to be able to tell me, and explain to me.  If I'm censored, and wrong, I will never learn the truth.</p>

        <p>The worst thing about the media is their ability to fear monger. People tell me to turn off the news, but I want to call them out because I believe in the press and I will hold them accountable. Now the latest version of the fear monger is the Delta variant and how the "scientists" predict that 4000 people a day will die from the Delta variant by November.</p>

        <p>"The" truth doesn't really exist. It's a bunch of narratives.</p>
<p>Best to have a set of individual guiding principles and morals to guide your actions. After that, in looking for information, I trust my eyes and ears the most. I walk in my neighborhood, talk to people, get involved. Local information and politics is way more important to my life that all the national bullshit and narrative-crafting that goes on in the media.</p>
<p>I try to ignore national politics as much as possible. I have the least agency to make change there, and it generally has the least impact on my day to day life.</p>

        <p>The thing about participating in the news/reddit/internet is that we have no effective agency in those places. Our "leverage" is very low. It is very difficult to change someone's mind, to teach them. Doubly difficult when they are predisposed to dislike you and their emotions are whipped up. Triple difficulty when you're doing it solely through text on a computer/phone.</p>

        <p>You're sanctimonious attitude is not welcome. You don't give up all your freedom to the government for short term safety.

<p>Basically I just made a few comments on a couple subs other than this and then when I tried making a comment on r centrist it gave me that message instantly.  I'm going to check with their mods to make sure it wasn't anything they did.  I doubt it because users here mentioned something sounding very similar happening to them.</p>
<p>Is this happening to users of others subs as well or is just targeting us?</p>

<p>Lol and progressives threw their weight behind this guy 🥴. Like Bernie and Grandpa Hairsniff somehow have even remotely the same politics. This is the same guy who authored the 1995 crime bill.</p>
<p>If you don't vote 3rd party, particularly in your state and local elections, this is never gonna end. Vote for someone affiliated with BLM to your city council. Vote Libertarian in Federal Elections. I don't care. Just stop giving your money and your vote to the Democrats and Republicans. It's the most milquetoast oppression ever in the history of mankind.</p>

        <p>is there actually any study that doesn't count hospitalizations since january/february? Most studies I've seen where like that, and no wonder most people infected are unvaccinated because in january and february barely anyone was vannicated.</p>

        <p>it's just like the "99% of new infections are from unvaccinated people". But right now they only test vaccinated people if they have serious symptoms. And non-vaccinated people are tested non stop if they get any symptoms. So no wonder "more" unvaccinated people have positive test results.</p>

        <p>It's probably true, the really question is 99% of how many hospitalizations? I've seen more than a few articles claiming "100% of covid cases in the hospital are unvaccinated!" And when you dig to find the number (because they never mention it) it's like 3 cases.</p>
<p>We know that infection with sars-cov-2 confers robust immunity to subsequent infection. Between the vaccine and immunity from prior infection, we are at "herd immunity". The pandemic is over in most places. We will see flare ups in places where alpha variant never spread, but for all intents and purposes we won.</p>

        <p>I am not for violence, but other than that most of the people are still siding with the government so it wouldnt work out well. 
When the group of people grows that sees through all of this it would only take massive disobedience to change things.</p>

        <p>It could be anything. My experience with covid was feeling extremely tired and having trouble breathing, especially if it was supine. But it goes away. When I needed to unplug the toilet for an hour with the plunger on a rotten day with the virus, I realized that the heavy exercise from plunging the toilet did not make me sicker, it actually made me feel better. From that day on, I tried to exercise a little each day and it was an extreme help.</p>

        <p>From what I read (Guardian) Delta variant is 'like a bad cold' for most people. 
People dont loose taste/smell anymore and usually arent short of breath. 
Headache and tiredness are common. 
So yes could be it, but also normal cold/ other virus. Take some extra supplements if you can: vitamine C, D and Zink. Get well soon!</p>

        <p>We thought we had COVID a few months ago (ended up being RSV), and we knocked it out in a few days with Vitamins C and D3 and elderberry gummies. The little boy who gave RSV to my kids was sick for a couple weeks. After seeing how quickly we bounced back, those three things are my go-to for not getting sick. I’ve heard elderberry is contraindicated for COVID (can’t remember why exactly), but the other two should be fine and will probably help regardless of what you have.</p>

        <p>I forgot about elderberry but also heard that was good for throat aches, didnt hear it was contraindicated for Covid. 
Studies have shown people with Covid that end up in hospital for a majority have low vitamine D levels. C and Zink are good for any infections. And Quercetine is used as a supplement (in combinatiën with zink) for Covid. The combination of these supplements is now adviced by doctors that werent allowed to prescribe hydrochloroquine anymore. Dr Zelenko mentioned Quercetine recently on the interview on Vimeo. I just ordered some of these just in case...</p>

        <p>Don't you know that those of us who use the CDC, UN, WHO, FDA, .gov sites, AMA, etc just totally baffle their minds?!  You can't post anything more complicated than a twitter feed or it confuses them! Lol.  I had one guy arguing with me, posted links to vaccine studies... and lo and behold, if you actually read the studies, they backed up what I was saying!  And when I pointed that out to him, he just got all flustered and confused and wouldn't read his own links.  I think he posted them just to look smart or because of the titles, but didn't bother reading them beyond the title, or he just couldn't understand what they said because it was beyond his comprehension and reading skill.</p>

        <p>In any reasonable era, yes--but reason went out the window with the advent of COVID.</p>
<p>I've been disturbed by how the requirements got stronger and stronger in my area. At one point, people with underlying conditions could go mask free. Then, suddenly, the requirements seemed to get stronger, and I heard nothing about exemptions. And I did start hearing store propaganda messages saying "masks required" and saying those who can't wear one should consider curbside pickup.</p>

        <p>I remember when only ill people were supposed to wear masks. Now with this "anyone can be sick" asymptomatic mess, it's like... bye bye freedom of choice.</p>
<p>Sorry, I am just struggling at work with being pregnant and having to mask. I can't friggin' breathe. I'm trying to fight it, but they basically told me I can't teach anymore.</p>

<p>If memory serves, one of Trump's speeches on the way out (maybe shortly after the 6th?) was very out of character with the words he was using - some people even said it looked deepfaked (overall lack of movement, neck looked weird, etc)</p>

<p>Sorry, you (and many others) got played. Look up "Operation Trust". The whole thing was a psyop to neuter any grassroots reaction to the spectacular corruption unfolding. Look how magnificently it worked - people are still waiting for some secret hero to swoop in and save the day.</p>
<p>That hero doesn't exist, and is never coming.</p>

        <p>Dr. Evil is lying to Sen. Rand Paul:</p>
<p>Dr. EVIL aka Fauci made sure that none of the cheap and safe cures were used. Dr. Evil drove up covid numbers with fake PCR tests, Dr. Evil gave incentives to hospitals to label every death a covid death, all because Big Pharma would make HUGE profits selling the experimental so called vaccines.</p>
<p>Fauci needs to be tried under the Nuremberg Codes before the FDA gives full approval.</p>

        <p>In the past few days I posted here about a new lockdown in Australia, asked how to get rid of "wearing is caring" trophy from my profile (which appeared there out of nowhere), shared news about staff being fired from a hospital for not being vaxxed, shared an image of a banner in a French city- and guess what, every single post was removed. No explanation, no reason. I even posted a question asking why it is happening to my posts, which was removed instantly, of course. Has something happened to this sub?</p>

        <p>I posted this last night somewhere but it wasn't seen I think because reddit was glitching out so I will repost and expand: </p>
<p>Notice something here....</p>
<p>I watched a large portion of the riot streams last year and there were times and places where antifa/blm would clash with various patriots, sometimes it was heated but peaceful debates and other times it would be fisticuffs but the cops were usually right their to bailout the soyboy antifa....</p>
<p>Where is that here?. If we are so outnumbered and they are so convinced in what they believe and the social media interactions seem roughly the same then where is the counter-demonstrations???</p>
<p>This is a shill game, just like last yeah but how are you going to pay people to riot in the streets when you have to keep the perception that this is the 'super duper deadliest disease of all timeses' so the shilling it done online and onscreen to give normies the impression of consensus so they get demoralized and accept this new normal and if they are not right in their lives turn on their fellow citizens like what happens with the Jews and them being supposedly diseased... People also don't understand many Jews turned on their own and became the guards in the concentration camps because of their own individual selfishness, so be careful of who you trust if these restrictions start to get more real.... It is important to keep in mind is all of the projection that comes from these... its easy to see once someone spends a good year or two doing various drug treatment programs as it is a self-defense mechanism of the unconscious.</p>

        <p>honestly, i don't get why vaxports are such a contention point. leading indicators, like gibraltar, israel, etc, impose rules on both vaxd and unvaxd. hell, the US is starting to go that direction too with the mask rules! vaxports are just a fake coercion tool, like when the UK govt came up with that "no isolation w vax" nonsense then proceeded to exempt that rule for France</p>

        <p>As someone who most likely disagrees with 99% of this community I would like to ask a few questions to try and better understand your POV.</p>
<p>I'm mostly confused as to why you think the government is on a mission of control or fear mongering. I understand and sympathize with an individual wanting to make their own choices and not get a vaccine or wear a mask. But I don't understand why you think the government pushing for vaccines or masks is nefarious. </p>
<p>What is the governments nefarious plan that you are afraid of? How do vaccines or masks wearing advance the governments evil agenda?</p>
<p>Why do you think the government has a nefarious mission and is not interested in the protection of it's people or the protection of societal norms? </p>
<p>What is the government trying to accomplish with their pandemic strategy that upsets you?</p>
<p>What am I missing about your POV?</p>

<p>The fact that sars-cov-2 infection is ao mild in young people as to be inconsequential. Why is the federal government so hellbent on vaccinating kids when we know that they don't get Covid, and their infections are either asymptomatic or very mild? And once they get infected, they have robust, long-lasting immunity.</p>
<p>There's no scientific, risk-based reason for anyone except the elderly to <em>need</em> the vaccine.</p>
<p>So, why is it getting pushed on kids? Same old reason - profit for the big corporations, who have captured the regulatory agencies. Every news show on the planet allows "ex FDA head" Scott Gottlieb on to fearmonger about covid causing holes in your brain while conveniently forgetting to mention he's on the board of Pfizer.</p>
<p>It's the same old crooked game. Dick Cheney was on the board of Halliburton and dragged us into Iraq so Halliburton  could get billion-dollar contracts. Obama's EPA cheif came directly from Monsanto. They've ramped up the fear in you so bad just to keep you watching their advertising and buying their product. Over and over again.</p>

        <p>They want to vaccinate everyone to both build up herd immunity and prevent younger people from spreading it to older people who will die from the disease and overrun our health care systems.</p>

<p>Slow down and think about this critically for a sec. If the older people are vaccinated, then they're not going to die. The younger people who do contract sars-cov-2 become immune to it, and they don't get sick generally. So in both cases we avoid overburdening the healthcare system.</p>
<p>&rt;And while they may want you to buy their product, no US citizen or UK citizen has to pay for their vaccine. It's paid for by the government.</p>
<p>Where do you think a government gets money? At least you recognize that Pfizer is indeed profiting off of these vaccines, I've talked to many Pro-pharma people who don't believe that the pharma companies are getting paid 🙄.</p>
<p>&rt;The faster everyone has immunity is the faster we can get back to normal imo.</p>
<p>I agree, and with the immunity conferred by prior infection, we're likely already there.</p>

        <p>If older people have been vaccinated then why worry about spreading it from younger people?</p>
<p>Paid for by the government means paid for by the citizen with taxes, that money comes from the people, so actually the people are paying for the vaccine whether they're getting it or not. We shouldn't look at government money as not our money.</p>
<p>The faster the media stop fear-mongering the faster we can go back to normal imo, unfortunately after COVID there's going to be something else used to keep us in fear and maybe even locked down. Here in the UK the media have already reported that we may have to lock down over the flu this winter as we've all apparently lost our immunity due to locking down due to COVID. The logic of locking down because we locked down is heavily flawed but the media want to keep us in fear and that means this will never end.</p>

        <p>I'm also in the UK and firstly not all older people are vaccinated and secondly we need to prevent the virus from spreading because the more it spreads the more it mutates and the more it mutates the more chance the virus has to evade our vaccines.</p>

        <p>Well almost all older people have been given the choice to be vaccinated, with extremely rare exceptions, if they have chosen to not take the vaccine then is that not their choice to accept the risk? It's nobody else's responsibility but their own really, and although the survival rate is lower for older people it's still extremely high for every age group (I believe it's around 90% for over 95s). People should be able to make their own decisions without being restricted from services imo.</p>
<p>Many professionals (for example former vice CEO of Pfizer Dr Mike Yeadon) have said it's highly unlikely the virus will evolve to a point where a booster shot will be required for 40+ years, the media just make suggestions like that it'll mutate to beat the virus for the sake of fear-mongering.</p>
<p>Another point is if the virus can mutate to beat the vaccine then why bother with the vaccine? Especially when natural immunity is much stronger and less likely for the virus to overcome so quickly. Or why don't we use vaccines that aren't mRNA? Like the COVAX vaccine which works much like any other vaccine (dead virus sample) which is gives much more comprehensive immunity?</p>

        <p>Look at every time a government has dominant control over its people, from Mao to Pinochet they were corrupt as fuck and literally destroyed the lives of millions who they were charged with protecting as per the role of the government, government should serve the will of the people and govern by consent, not the other way around! None of these pricks ever gave up their power either, politicians like these are the most corrupt, power hungry, narcissistic and morally bankrupt pieces of shit to ever roam the planet!</p>
<p>Counter question, why do you think it’s good for government to have all these powers over yours and everyone else’s lives? Short of you liking the boot on your neck for the rest of your life I mean!</p>

        <p>Where do you live? I'm an American citizen living in the UK and neither of those places have any more COVID restrictions. I don't think it's a genuine argument for either of those countries to say the government has anything close to dominant control over it's people.</p>
<p>But you aren't specifically stating what powers the government has over me in relationship to COVID. Of course I don't want the government to have control over me but as far as I can tell I'm living freely right now with zero COVID restrictions as of yesterday.</p>
<p>So youre saying that government officials are corrupt and power hungry. Yes that is probably true. But how does COVID advance their agenda? What is the agenda? That's what I'm not understanding and I'm not sure you've answered it.</p>

        <p>Why do you trust the government and corporations who have a long history of screwing over the people under their "care"? That is reason enough to distrust everything they put out to us. Their history is filled with breaches of trust and paved with lies and deciet and treachery. The government will use any excuse to gain power, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and war are their favourite tools for gaining control over people. Learn the history of pfizer, moderna, J%J, your government, see how well your trust in them is placed. J%J allowed a cancer causing substance in their baby powder. Think about that, a product for babies, they do not give a fuck about us or the consequences of their products. Do you want to live as a slave does? As a Jew did in world war II Nazi occupied lands? The government is heading to oppression of those who chose not to take the so called vaccine. Read the history of these people in powerful positions, trust is earned, not given. These corporations and governments and leaders have not earned our trust.</p>

        <p>I am against the covid 19 "vaccine". Not anti-vaccine, as I have a full slew of normal vaccines. Fully passed trials, and with decades of use with no ill effects. The covid 19 "vaccine" is a new technology with unknown long term risks, and many known risks. The likelihood of my death or injury from covid 19 is so low that it is less than getting into a car and driving, so I am hesitant to even get one in the first place, in the second place, the "vaccine" is full of health risks that I am not willing to make for a virus that I may not even notice having if I ever got it. I do not know anyone who got covid, nor do I know anyone who died from it. Not saying it is a hoax, but I personally have no experiences that prove there to even be a virus other than the common flu, propped up with the title coronavirus, and propoganda blasting away about it to put fear in everyone over something that was normal previously. We never locked down for any other terrible virus or pandemic previously, why now? For something so low risk to healthy people?    </p>
<p>I do not trust anyone to do with this business of the lockdown or vaccines, they are not trustworthy and have a history of horrible practices and products.    </p>
<p>The most terrifying part of this all is not knowing the end goal, I do not know what the end game plan is, but I can guess, based off of what they are planning. I think it will end in a caste type system where the vaccinated and those who are not are seperate in a jim crow style system. It is about control and power rather than the vaccine itself, that is just the excuse they use to single you out as "not under their control", probably on several lists for when the government later decides to detain my undesirable ass and put me in a concentration camp to do hard labor or be killed. The vaccine is not trustworthy, those who made it are not trustworthy, those who push it are not trustworthy, and those who manufactured this crisis are not trustworthy.</p>

        <p>What they are trying to accomplish is <strong>control</strong>. A social credit system.<br>
Everyone has the tracing app and check-in app installed. This is the first step. The next step will be ratings based on your ecological footprint, your health history,  your credit rating. Well you can imagine where it goes from there.   </p>
<p>The apps are in place and people already accept they can't enter certain places without a checkmark. Soon more and more restrictions will be added.</p>

        <p>I think I have more faith in people. I know that while I personally got vaccinated and use the contact tracing app, I would never go along with a social credit system.</p>
<p>The contact tracing app is non legally binding and unenforceable. It doesn't track locations and uses Bluetooth to ping nearby devices. The govt has no control over it and they don't know who does or doesn't have it installed.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to do what I can to get through this pandemic as fast as possible and I believe vaccination is the quickest and most non lethal way out.</p>

        <p>You say that you wouldn't go along with it now, but a lot of people said they'd not go along with contact tracing or vaccine passports yet here we are where both are now being implemented (UK here). A lot of people say they'll be against x y z until it happens and then it's framed in such a way that they jump on the bandwagon, I'm not saying that you will specifically as I don't know you, but the vast majority unfortunately have shown us that they're easily manipulated.</p>
<p>The contact tracing app isn't enforceable but it doesn't stop the NHS calling you, emailing you, SMSing you left right and centre 5-6 times a day if you test positive and demand you tell them everywhere you've been. In the UK while the technology of contact tracing makes it anonymous it's still collected anonymously and it wouldn't be too difficult to link an anonymous ID to a name if the government tried, in fact the police already collect Bluetooth MAC and Wi-Fi addresses on a database for tracking people's movements in some places in London, it wouldn't be too hard to combine the two databases to work out who many of the people are.</p>
<p>I have COVID currently, the WHO has said that it gives 80% immunity long term after infection, that's comparable to the vaccine, so why should I risk the side effects of the vaccine when I already have immunity?</p>
<p>I appreciate you coming here and asking for opinions in a way that isn't argumentative or rude, and I hope you read my responses in the same respect.</p>

        <p>So my POV has been shaped by listening to a couple different doctors talk about this online. They are reputable doctors that have in the past gave life saving recommendations (example Dr.pierre Kory with use of corticosteroids to treat covid patients). Now the MSM is ignoring him because he found a cheap alternative treatment that could possibly end this pandemic but it is being considered misinformation and then censored by the media. Why isn't a doctor allowed to talk about his professional opinions online?</p>
<p>There is currently a law suit being filed by doctors to stop the use of the vaccine on children in the United States. The science about this is far from settled but they won't see it any other way. I can google how many people have died of Covid 19 around the world day by day. Then I try to find any information on the vaccine deaths and it is shrouded is secrecy and hard to access data. For proper informed consent I should know that.</p>
<p>The government is censoring doctors online and giving them no media attention. They are hiding the number of side effects of the vaccine and the death count. How many people are going to die from the vaccine world wide? So we obviate have an acceptable rate of death. I'd just like to know what it is since apperantly the pandemic is an unacceptable rate that needs to be fixed. Even the alcohol and smoking kill more people every year than covid has. A quick google search says 7.7 million people die every year from smoking. That's okay with the government but 4 million from covid is a reason to shut down the world and shove a vaccine into everyone. Doesn't make sense the government doesn't care about our health</p>

        <p>What exactly are you asking?</p>
<p>Do you like your politicans? Do you like the policies they are implementing?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf">This is a paper published by the Rockefeller Institute. Its probably the biggest and most influential "Think-Tank" in the world. Your leaders meet with them, they talk to them, they take their advice. Now read the paper and tell me that this is the thinking you want your leaders to have. This is the way, you want people who influence your life, to look at society.</a></p>
<p>We can go further.</p>
<p>One of the founders of UNESCO Julian Huxley wrote an essay called <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000068197">"The philosphie and purpose of the UNESCO"</a>. Its not to wild a piece, compared to the Rockefeller one. But there are so many things in there that I inherently disagree with.</p>
<p>You really need to understand that these people look at the world differently. They assume to have power of you, your family, your friends, your kids. They want you to be the way they want you to.</p>
<p>Even if they were true to their words (which they clearly arent), I disagree. But they arent, for the most part every political party around this globe has a huge discrepancy between what they say and what they do. And that discrepancy somehow almost always ends up being negative for simple people / nature.</p>

        <p>I am genuinely asking what the people of this sub are so afraid of and how that relates to the COVID pandemic. Because based off what you just sent me it seems unrelated to the COVID pandemic and you're more concerned about an elite group of people having control over you. That's a fine concern to have but I don't understand how COVID restrictions advance whatever their agenda is.</p>
<p>I'm an American citizen living in the UK and in both of these places there no longer any COVID restrictions so I don't understand what the argument you're making is.</p>

        <p>Read the paper again. Its titled:</p>
<p>"Scenarios for the future of technology and international development"</p>
<p>Read the Lock-Step scenario and tell me that this is not exactly what is happening. And then, again tell me that this is how you want to be governed. By abusing pandemics...</p>
<p>And, btw. Yes thats exactly the issue here: Elites grabbing power. More power. And more power.</p>
<p>Im german and we still have quite a lot restrictions. Also to think that this is over and the restrictions wont be back soon is very optimistic.</p>

        <p>Okay so I've read the paper just now and I think you are misinterpreting it somewhat.</p>
<p>The lockstep scenario is a hypothesis based on high levels of political and economic alignment and low levels of adaptive capacity. It's not a plan or playbook for governments to follow.</p>
<p>We clearly live with a high level of political and economic alignment where the flow of goods, capital and people is globalized and fast paced. However we clearly have low levels of adaptive capacity which the author's define as "the existence of trust in society, the presence and tolerance of novelty and diversity".</p>
<p>I hate to say it but after reading this paper it appears that this sub definitely exhibits a low level of trust in society which breeds the kind of lockstep scenario the author's create. So in an ironic way the sentiment of this sub is contributing to the realisation of the lockstep scenario.</p>
<p>That said the lockstep scenario does suck ass and we are more in it than not. Unfortunately given the low levels of trust in society and the lack of empathy and tolerance for novelty and diversity it doesn't seem like we're on the right path towards a clever together scenario.</p>

        <p>How Covid ties into it?</p>
<p>1.) It creates compliances. You want that if you want to rule against the ruled.</p>
<p>2.) The policies / money stream enacted throughout the pandemics have been the quickest and largest in human history. </p>
<p>I really dont wanna go into any details, because I alone could fill books. The thing is a lot of these changes are subtle. The agendas are planned over decades. It really comes down to whether you like what they envision or not and whether you believe them or not.</p>
<p>Apparently you either like it and believe them, or are unaware of the plans.</p>

        <p>I will read your linked paper to learn more but I'm still not understanding your points here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don't see any link between the COVID compliances and the government having more ruling power. And any compliances have been lifted in the US and the UK. So this argument doesn't make sense to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In what way? This also doesn't make any sense to me. All the governments have done is print money leading to inflation.</p>

<li>Its not about actually doing something its about your willingness to do what you are told, when you are being told that.</li>
<li>There has been a massive shift towards the rich. Say the inflation is 10%. Your wage stayed the same. Billionaires gained 40% wealth increase in just one year (record year for billionaires). Now you get 10% less ressources with your money. Which the wealthy will now use, because theyve beaten inflation by 30%.</li>
</ol>
<p>Its really as simple as having a ruling class and a working class. The working class shall be  perfectly matched with the needs of the ruling class. Its really only about obedience and compliance. If I say jump, you shall only answer how high.</p>

        <p>&rt;I'm mostly confused as to why you think the government is on a mission of control or fear mongering.</p>
<p>Its in the nature of a government staffed by people lacking any serious amount of virtue to try to increase their own power. It does not matter what level this government is at. Combine that with our government effectively being captured by corporate interests and you get one hellbent on mandating things which will help corporate profits. Like endless rounds of vaccines and boosters. Lockdowns which funnel money by the dumptruck load into the largest and richest corporations on the planet. Fear mongering which keeps corporate media running, when otherwise they would be dead already.</p>
<p>When you see all the powerful financial interests that align with lockdowns, fear, and pharma mandates, the question changes from "why would they do this?" to "why the fuck wouldn't they do this?".</p>

<p>This is going to give their countries a bad rep and nobody wants to have children in or travel to a draconiancommiestate. Tourism will obviously suffer as well. More and more pple will start to resent this overreach and become more and more against staying and supporting the G.</p>

        <p>My opinion at this point is that most people are wired to see things one way or the other, and with the same information given to everyone over the last 16 months some will look at it all and think that the covid threat is real and if we hadn't done all the restrictions there would had been way more casualties, the amount of deaths were either appropriately labelled or under counted and that the governments are doing what they think they need to do to mitigate risks at least at a minimum.</p>
<p>Others think it was way overblown and no more people would had died if we didn't do anything, that more people died as a result of the restrictions and that government around the world have found a new way to at a minimum enrich themselves (The premier of Ontario owns a family label company that has made a lot more money since covid started by selling signage for businesses) and at a maximum bring forth new ways to control people.</p>
<p>There are countless posts on here with articles or government documents that show examples of absurd government hypocrisy, power grabs and human rights violations.</p>
<p>You might read these articles see nothing wrong or think it's misinformation where as others see example after example of why they shouldn't trust anything about the pandemic and don't want to go along with it by wearing masks, getting tested or getting the vaccine.</p>

        <p>How exactly do I admit I was wrong about there not being any long term studies, animal testing, no data for people with autoimmune diseases, no responsibility held of vaccine makers, lack of transparency with breakthrough cases, and the list goes on and on of actually proven FACTS. I pray this vaccine works, but I demand these issues be addressed.</p>

        <p>Do you live in the US? If so, are you <em>not</em> back to normal already? Are you still masking and distancing and all that? If so, why? It sounds like you're waiting for the government to declare the pandemic over before you feel "normal" again. Take it from someone who has been around for a while - governments are <em>never</em> going to declare the pandemic over and repeal the laws they pass. If you're in the US, are you still concerned about middle eastern terrorism? Probably not for a decade or more, yet we still have the PATRIOT act with us. No one ever declared that 'middle eastern terrorism is over'.</p>
<p>I mean, everything <em>has</em> gone back to normal where I live - no one is masking, there are no mask mandates, and the state government has stripped most institutions from requiring vaccination. It took a Republican governor and legislature to make it happen though.</p>
<p>And since 90% of our elderly are vaccinated, we have not seen an increase in deaths, despite a mild increase in cases and only having 50% of the total population vaccinated.</p>
<p>So, things <em>are</em> back to normal for us, and it's working. But I can see the Federal Government screwing with things very easily. And when I look at Canada, France, and a number of other countries, I grow very concerned about these authoritarian, anti-liberty ideas coming to our shores.</p>
