        <p>I've been waiting on a follow up to this video since he seems like the one of the only journalists digging in to this story, which we all suspect but can't really prove beyond doubt yet.</p>

        <p>Yes we can.</p>

<p>But different countries are also reporting cases and deaths in different ways: in Italy, Covid-19 is listed as the cause of death even if a patient was already ill and died from a combination of illnesses.</p>
<p>“Only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus,” said the scientific adviser to Italy’s minister of health last week.</p>
<p>Spain’s national government simply lists how many people with confirmed cases of coronavirus have died and provides no extra information on any other medical conditions. </p>

<p>“There are also some additional deaths that happen in someone who happened to be COVID positive, but where the COVID infection had nothing to do with the deaths,” she said. “So we are at IDPH trying to remove those obvious cases where the COVID diagnosis was not the reason for the death. If there was a gunshot wound, if there was a motor vehicle accident, we know that that was not related to the COVID positive status.</p>
<p>“We are trying to make sure that things that aren’t related at all to the COVID diagnosis are removed, but if someone has another illness, like heart disease, and then had a stroke or other event, it’s not as easy to separate that and say COVID didn’t exacerbate that existing illness. That would not be removed from the count,” she added. </p>
<p>In Illinois and many other states, if your 73 with a heart disease and given few months to live, when you pass away and test " positive for covid ", you count as a covid death...</p>

<p>In layman's terms: if you were a fat, asthmatic fuck who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day, they conveniently left that part out.</p>

        <p>I know about these sources, there is also the Cook County Illinois Medical Examiner case archive, which lets you dig into the secondary causes on all the deaths, and you'll see there that the vast majority have 2 or 3 terminal conditions, like end stage renal failure, multiple cancers etc.  </p>
<p>https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Public-Safety/Medical-Examiner-Case-Archive/cjeq-bs86/data</p>
<p>The other good source which you haven't listed here is the pathologist Dr Klaus Püschel in Hamburg, Germany, who has autopsied many of the bodies of covid patients and found that 'so far, I am not surprised that these people died', and that all of them were found to have serious terminal issues other than covid.</p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2003</p>
<p>Some comments from a press conference he gave:</p>
<p>'Professor Püschel again emphasized that Covid-19 “is not nearly as threatening as was initially suspected”. The danger was “too much influenced by media images”. The media had focused on severe individual cases and fueled panic with “completely wrong messages”. Covid-19 is not a “killer virus” and the call for new medicine or vaccines is “driven by fear, not facts.”</p>
<p>The specific cause of death of the examined cases was pneumonia, but in about 50% of the cases there were venous thrombosis in the legs, which can lead to fatal pulmonary embolism. The kidneys and heart muscle were also partially affected. Professor Püschel therefore recommends the preventive administration of blood-thinning medication for serious Covid cases.</p>
<p>With regard to thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, Professor Püschel – like other experts before – emphasized that a “lockdown” with quarantine at home was “exactly the wrong measure”, since the lack of exercise itself promotes thrombosis. Indeed, US specialists have already been warning of this risk after even Covid-negative people developed unexpected thrombosis.'</p>
<p>The only issue is to also prove that overcount is much more than undercount, since the counter argument is often 'even if some of these deaths are not covid we are missing many deaths'.  There is the automatic assumption by many that excess non-covid deaths, which are probably being caused by lockdown, are actually uncounted covid deaths.  So we really need a proper, detailed scientific study that we can put in front of people and say, here are all the reasons.  The alternative to this would be an undercover investigation that could prove this is being done on purpose, which I am hoping for out of Veritas.  I am also hoping this leads to a proper investigation into malpractice in hospitals which I believe has been the cause of many deaths of otherwise healthy people, who have been sedated and ventilated when it wasn't required.  </p>
<p>At the moment it's a loose collection of sources and I totally agree, for me it is more than enough as I've done so much research and looked at all of it to get an informed opinion, but to the public who are being told the opposite every day, it would be useful to have a single definitive source to point them at and not require them to do too much thinking - they clearly are not good at that!</p>

        <p>a few people’s observations aren’t enough evidence of this of course. are we seeing an abnormally few amount of people dying from things such as cancer or heart disease?</p>
