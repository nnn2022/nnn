        <p>Whether it has anything to do Covid or not, he should be fined and arrested for plenty of other reasons outside of Covid-19 restrictions.</p>

        <p>Outside of being an asshole neighbor running a nightclub out of an apartment? That should be an offense worthy of arrest in and of itself. Yes, I know it's not legally something you can actually be arrested for, but there are plenty of people out here who have and know that neighbor who think that would be nice to have as an option.</p>
<p>But to the point at hand...</p>
<p>Noise violations.  <br>
Running a business out of an apartment, zoning violation.<br>
Running an illegal night club.<br>
Selling food and beverage without a food service license. <br>
Selling alcohol without a license to sell alcohol.<br>
Lack of appropriate fire exits, fire suppression and fire extinguishers(zoning again). <br>
Too many people for the space.(safety &amp; zoning)</p>
<p>Not known for sure but probably were happening.</p>
<p>Probably also serving underage people alcohol.<br>
Probably some drugs being sold as well.</p>

<p>I'm glad you don't sit on the judiciary. And oh yeah, get bent you prude.</p>

        <p>I am far from a prude, but whatever works for you.</p>
<p>What would be the problem with me sitting on a judiciary? Because I know the law and know that you can't throw someone in the clink for being an asshole? So you are afraid I would let someone go instead of putting them in jail for being an asshole?</p>
<p>You should realize there is a difference between wishing something could be done legally, and realizing that there is no way that it actually could be done legally.</p>
<p>Not sure why you went with the whole prude thing, I have no problem with people eating, drinking, doing drugs, fucking, and any other number of things as long as it is free will.</p>
<p>What I do have a problem with is when people do those things against the law, and running an illegal nightclub in a location not zoned for a night club because of occupancy and fire safety, and not licensed for food, beverage or alcohol sales and potentially selling to minors is against the law for all of those things and it has nothing to do with my own personal feelings, outside of expecting people to abide by long standing, accepted laws.</p>

        <p>A shitty local rag drummed up this delightful article about how sheep should stay in line else face consequences such as arrest, fines and/or criminal charges. </p>
<p>“When we attended this morning, just after 3 o’clock, we found a party that was in full swing — it’s an approximate 1,100-square-foot penthouse,” Sgt. Steve Addison said Sunday. “This appeared to be operating as a nightclub and a bit of a show lounge.”  Sounds like the host was throwing quite the banger. Bold but ultimately a regretful choice in this new normal.</p>
<p>“I think he should be booted out of the building. It’s a very well-run building, lots of professional people. No time for that. I think he should go somewhere else,” one neighbor told CityNews." Overflowing with salt, this particular individual probably gets social anxiety at parties and would rather stay in his safe space and circlejerk themselves on reddit.</p>
<p>"Online comments are also unkind to the party host. One Reddit poster says he “needs significant jail time and be last on the list for the vaccine,” though one reply asks, maybe logically, “Wouldn’t vaccinating the rule-breakers first slow the spread?”  Once again, we find that reddit is the source of expert opinions that pass the stringent standards for journalistic content.</p>
<p>This is a fuckin clown world boys and girls. Watch out or you'll be next to be burned at the stake.</p>
