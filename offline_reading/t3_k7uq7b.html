        <p>Can i just add? I told myself that I was done with Reddit for the night, closed it, scrolled down to the bottom of that snopes page for some dume reason and saw <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/eric-clapton-racist-rant/">this</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;Did Eric clapton once unleash a racist rant onstage?</p>
<p>How did I know that this was going to be deemed "true" before I clicked it? Because not one week ago I saw on this very sub that he was writing a protest song. So of course they have to smear his name.</p>
<p>I'm not getting into whether he did or not, I didn't even read it. The point is this proves that they are out to discredit specific types of arguments that go agaisnt government/corporate collaborative profits and we must keep calling this shit out and making people aware at just what scale this information war is being fought on.</p>

        <p>Nice link. Yes it's always the same. </p>
<p>Misrepresent the argument in the headline. Maybe some FB people who shared this said he was "head of research" so that is what they dispute instead of the meat of the matter. As he himself will openly tell you at the beggining of any video/article he was the head of respiratory (pretty relevant wouldn't you say?) research at Pfizer. He also always states he is not anti vax despite this article trying to tie him to that crowd. </p>
<p>They then go on to say not one thing about steralisation apart from that they reached out to Pfizer for comment and got no reply lol. </p>
<p>These are the articles idiots read so they can feel good about ignoring you. </p>
<p>Keep calling this out. nice one.</p>

        <p>And you're probably right that 99% of the time.</p>
<p>Fact checkers don't check whether something is factual or not. They check whether the facts aren't too uncomfortable for those pushing a particular sociopolitical agenda.</p>

        <p>I remember internet forums \~20 years ago where mods banned people for 'lying'. These places didn't end up well, they usually went into ghostown state in like 6 months. Usually, it happens when mods are total psychopats, which put people in the position when you can't figure out what to post to NOT get banned. Same things happened to places with mods using mod-forced signatures 'this person is lying' under posts of people.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not everything can be called a fact. You can't say that the existence of god is a fact, or non-existence of god is a fact.</li>
<li>Truth is subjective. The same 3D object looks differently from 2 different POVs</li>
<li>No one can be help responsible for being truthful 100% of the time. No one is right 100% of the time. Including factcheckers themselves, which adds another layer to the situation, when 'lyer bans the lyer'.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these things combined suppress all speech, not just 'free speech'. People will stop going to fact-checked places. You can't post anything there, and there is nothing interesting to read.</p>

        <p>Kind of take issue with your take on “truth”</p>
<p>Lots and lots of facts are definitive, but then with science we frequently rely on data to substantiate hypotheses. At time there’s daylight and room to debate, but other times it’s just not viable or “true”. For example, say masks restrict oxygen has be scientifically debunked. Someone with no expertise in the space saying the opposite because they “think” so is dumb AF and not a place their subjective POV is relevant or true</p>

        <p>Flat-earthers coming to an astrophysics conference are time wasters. Yes.</p>
<p>However, they should be allowed to hold their own conference with no restrictions. If their theory will allow them to design better space ships, they'll have the last laugh.</p>
<p>My facebook page, for example, is my space. I should be allowed to be wrong there, I should be allowed to lie there. This is not the case now. Now, if fact checkers think you are wrong, they can put "this person is lying" forced signature, demonetize you and shadowban you. This is an issue.</p>

        <p>Yeah, good to give people the forum, but facts should be clear. Going down a nutty rabbit hole can get dangerous if people aren’t clear about what’s true and what’s bullshit. </p>
<p>Also, social platforms are not forums for free speech. The companies are the arbiters of how things work in their sandbox. You want real free speech, get a sandwich board and go stand on a public corner, start your own web page or even social media platform. Hence the birth of Parlor.</p>

        <p>When you talk about 'dangerous', you mean religious fanatics, extremists, radicals of all sort? Do you know what unites all these people? Confidence that their opinion is the truth. If you trully know that god exists, and other people are sinners, you have no problem with killing them. If evil is clear and absolute, evil needs to be punished and eliminated, that's how humans function. So now rethink your position, are you slowly falling into extremism by 'knowing the truth'? My stance on truth allows for doubt at all times, which is essential in scientific process, and is a guardrail from extremism.</p>
<p>Yes, social platforms are private companies to do whatever they want. However, this is not what was sold to us orignally. They invited us to facebook 15 years agoand said 'make yourself at home', 'this is your place for your self expression', so we treated it as our home. Now they reminded us that this is their platform, and our name is not on the deed, therefore we should do what they say. Well, this is not what we signed up to, and this is why we should leave. I already did. I do not post anything on facebook and I don't read my facebook feed.</p>
<p>Same thing happened to reddit. When I found this website, it was a very 'free speech', and this is what made it popular. When I am going to the internent, frankly, I am not looking for cabletv experience. If I want government propaganda, I'll turn on CBC which is a free over-the-air channel.</p>
<p>This is detrimental to their business, and I believe this will be an issue for them. Big Tech will ask the government for money, because big tech is paying a disproportional cost of censorship. Zuckerberg already took an issue with it. Censorship makes the platform unusable for everyone (not just for wrongthinkers).</p>

        <p>Then why bother going to facebook at all? We can just go to fact checker's website and read The Truth there. Or they can maybe set up a mailer to tell us what is considered the truth today.</p>
