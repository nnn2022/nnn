    <strong>Masks vs bras (and other garments)</strong>
    <p><p>This seems to be a common argument for the use of masks.  It seems to be the entry level argument for people wanting to dip their toe into the pro mask side of things.  I would like to take a moment to address this once, rather than fielding it over and over.</p>
<p>Perhaps this varies by locale, but I know of no laws requiring shirts, shoes, bras etc to be worn in public places.  I know there are decency and ludeness laws, which means you can't have your genitalia out, but nothing about the other stuff. </p>
<p>If there were laws like that, there would be no need for store owners to put up signs that say: "no shirt, no shoes, no service " as the practice (of not wearing them) would be illegal and the sign redundant. </p>
<p>Store owners are perfectly within their rights to impose conditions on who they do business with, with a very big distinction: those conditions cannot violate the law.</p>
<p>Although denying service to shoeless people is ok, you CANNOT deny service to protected groups, it's that simple.</p>
<p>The ADA REQUIRES businesses to accommodate disabled individuals. Unlike most accommodations, the ADA requires special access, ramps, handles etc. </p>
<p>You cannot deny someone access because of their medical condition...PERIOD.</p>
<p>I have read [on reddit] that the store owner can interrogate people as to the nature of their condition, what their service animal does etc.  Please cite where in the law it says that.</p>
<p>I submit the law does not allow for that and I will tell you why.  Walmart, Costco, target and every other major retailer with a legal department simply waves you through once you tell them you cannot wear a mask.  </p>
<p>Why would they do this if they had the legal authority to interrogate you and then deny you service based on their findings about your medical condition?  I mean, the safety of those people in the store is important...yet they let me pass, unmolested. </p>
<p>You don't have a right to my information and you really don't have a right to judge.</p>
<p>So mind your business (no it really isn't your business despite your pedantic whining about your right to be safe in public spaces).</p></p>

        <p>I keep seeing it compared to bras by people I know who often don't wear bras. But they're saying you HAVE TO WEAR IT! Just like you HAVE TO WEAR A BRA! But they don't wear bras. I've seen these women many times not wearing bras in public. I can tell you that two of them have brown, not pink areolas and I've never seen them topless. Just out in public wearing shirts that were a bit too see through and no bras.</p>
<p>I don't know if they're secretly anti-mask and find it funny to pretend to be pro-mask or if they think other people don't know how often they're free boobing it. It's pretty fucking crazy though.</p>

        <p>I’m an H cup 48 year old woman and I’ve spent the majority of the last ten years not wearing a bra because I’m simply more comfortable this way. Sure, my tits are freaking vertical now but I’m happy when I look in the mirror and I’ve never cared what other people think. So nope nope and nope no woman <em>has</em> to wear a bra. After all, we lived without them for millennia without a problem... oh and did I mention they were invented by men?</p>

        <p>I like the logic of comparisons of medical reasons not to mask with the ADA legislation.</p>
<p>In my state the mask requirement is for those “who can medically tolerate a mask”.  There’s nothing in the order that limits my freedom to go places. </p>
<p>I  hesitant to go out now because I don’t want to be accosted. I have considered keeping a printed copy from the health department with me. If the health department can make allowances for me, why can’t businesses and other people do so?</p>

        <p>Assuming the reasoning behind mandatory health garments (must wear one when communicable disease kills thousands globally daily) there is reason to believe many would like to see face coverings permanent. </p>
<p>We should be thinking about women's history with mandatory face coverings because our foremothers have gone to a great deal of trouble to assure girls today will not be required patriarchal symbols of oppression.  </p>
<p>The obvious modern comparison is the niqab, which only shows the women's eyes. There have been laws enacted to ban face coverings to protect women from undue persecution from conservative religious ideology. But **let's not forget that Christians were fans of mandatory face coverings** as well, and veils and face coverings are symbolic of the notion that a women should be house-bound, the veil symbolizing that notion (the house roof wherever you go) when they are in public.</p>
<p>The question isn't about bras per say, but what if women were required to wear skirts in public again?</p>
<p>Many health studies and even Dr. Falsie agree that masking is more symbolic that preventative. Unfortunately, this symbolism for women is one of great historical oppression.</p>

        <p>I agree it's probably not legal to turn away someone for not wearing a mask due to a disability. And that they can't require you to disclose your disability. However, Southwest Airlines just announced that they will allow no exceptions to their mandatory mask rule, and Delta Airlines just announced that you have to disclose the nature of your disability to a medical professional of their choosing over the phone. I'm looking forward to both companies getting sued over that.</p>
<p>Delta Airlines is also purposely making it risky and inconvenient to opt-out due to a medical condition. They won't let people do the call with the medical professional prior to arriving for the flight. It has to be once the person arrives at the gate, and Delta says it could take up to an hour. And there's always the risk that Delta will deny the exemption. So who could possibly take that risk?</p>
<p>Also, imagine someone who can't wear any type of face covering because of PTSD due to horrific abuse as a child. They would need to tell that to a stranger on the phone while at the airport, EVERY TIME they want to fly with Delta. Even for the return flight of a round trip ticket.</p>

        <p>Per ADA, a business must consider <em>reasonable modifications</em>.</p>
<p>Examples of reasonable modifications to a face mask policy</p>
<p>Allow a person to wear a scarf, loose face covering, or full face shield instead of a face mask;</p>
<p>Allow customers to order online with curbside pick-up or no contact delivery in a timely manner;</p>
<p>Allow customers to order by phone with curb-side pick-up or no contact delivery in a timely manner;</p>
<p>Allow a person to wait in a car for an appointment and enter the building when called or texted; or</p>
<p>Offer appointments by telephone or video calls.</p>
<p>So sure, if wherever you are talking about doesn't offer something like this list above (copied from the ADA website), then feel free to make a stink.  Otherwise, deal with it.  Seriously, in the words of the great Ahnold - "stop whining!"</p>

        <p>They let me in without issue, so no worries there.</p>
<p>I think most of the in person whining is the pro maskers and online is the antis.  That's just my observation.</p>
<p>Edit</p>
<p>It's also reasonable, an easier to just let people in, which is clearly, from personal experience, the policy of Walmart and Costco.</p>
