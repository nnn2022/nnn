        <p>“The first research in the world.” </p>
<p>They used various wavelengths of UV light to see what killed it. It’s like a middle school science project. UV light killing viruses and bacteria is nothing new, we use UV lights to sterilize (to a point) our tissue culture hoods. </p>
<p>What are we supposed to do with this information anyway? Bask under UV lights? Stick a UV light tube down our throats? Sterilize our whole house with UV lights? Blast grandma with a UV light ray gun?</p>

        <p>Yes. What a great suggestion to add to my list of actually effective measures to "slow the spread"...Replace all lightbulbs with UV lights in all homes and businesses. This, in conjunction with mandatory disconnection of all HVAC systems, the wearing of masks, goggles, and gloves at all times in homes and businesses and daily coronavirus testing, combined with in home air quality samples and surface swabs to test for the virus. Unless you voluntarily weld yourself inside your home and do not leave until the complete eradication of this virus. It spreads asymptomatically. Why are people not taking the same precautions at home that they do when they leave their homes? If they are leaving their home at all, they should quarantine and test negative twice before reentering their homes. Unless they live alone and have no pets. Imagine you spread it to your cat, then you let your cat outside and it spreads it everywhere. Little janie down the street pets the cat and asymptomatically catches the virus, then spreads it throughout the home and pretty soon janie killed grandma by petting the cat of a selfish person who wasn't taking all precautions at home.</p>
<p>And once everyone agrees to be welded into their houses after having to quarantine at the quarantine camp multiple times for doing frivolous activities like working, grocery shopping, attending school or petting a cat that has tested positive for the virus, we can reimagine the home building market. Homes will be windowless and have a small airlock for the enforcers to pass food trays through so no one has to leave their home and inadvertently asymptomatically spread the virus. Remember that we don't know how long immunity lasts which is why you will probably have to have covid booster shots frequently in order to limit risk.</p>
<p>New york was talking about utilizing 4000 officers to enforce restaurant protocol for this virus. Why not multiply that number by ten and nip this virus in the bud by having door to door enforcement and daily testing mandatory if you leave your home at all and come within 28 feet of any person or cat?</p>

        <p>Right because everyone knows the virus spreads and enters the home through HVAC systems, and unlike any virus before, multiplies without a host cell in our air ducts and lives in there for lengths of time. The primary source of infections definitely isn’t humans. So I agree. We need to line our whole home’s HVAC system with UVC lighting at a cost of thousands of dollars. This isn’t just throwing money at a minuscule and ridiculous thing to make us feel like we’re safer, this is super serial you guys.</p>

        <p>That's where you're wrong, the people ARE the ones who spread the virus. They bring it into their home asymptomatically and infect everyone by not wearing masks, gloves, goggles and frivolously using HVAC. That's why my comprehensive plan for virus eradication should be enacted immediately. I am a pro-safety, pro-science candidate and i seem to be the only one advocating for total war on and destruction of this virus. Didn't it take like 200 years to eradicate smallpox even WITH a vaccine? Let's not let covid turn into another smallpox. VOTE FOR SCIENCE.</p>

        <p>Well bubbles would never work because you could have a tiny pin prick in your bubble and not realize. Then BAM! your whole family is dead. That's why we need total lockdown. We need to retrofit homes to support this, prevent doors and windows from opening and install a secure airlock or some other means of passing a food tray through that won't involve spreading the virus. This has benefits against all infectious diseases and also benefits the climate, because with no one driving or even leaving their home for any reason i am sure CO2 levels will plummet. But, that's a discussion about my "actual green new deal", the details of which i haven't ironed down 100% yet. STAY TUNED.</p>
<p>And reminder: this virus is serious. We are basically living in the outbreak movie, guys. Good luck.</p>

        <p>If companies have that money to blow and it makes people feel “safer” and gets us back to work, sure, I don’t see why not. It’s money down the drain but investing in security theater has a psychological return.</p>
