    <strong>Natural Immunity</strong>
    <p><p>As a non-American, I find it bizarre that people regularly take 'flu shots'. I am not sure how common this practice is in other developed countries, but it is completely unnecessary anywhere. The body is perfectly capable of fighting off these viruses (except in very old or immunocompromised people). Big Pharma has swindled people again into a yearly ritual that earns it billions of dollars...</p></p>

        <p><strong>The Myth:</strong> vaccines provide “herd immunity” and are for the greater good of society. </p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Herd immunity through vaccination does not exist. The theory behind herd immunity is that if a given percentage of individuals (usually between 85-96%) are vaccinated, the community is fully immune from outbreaks and the immunized protect those who cannot be immunized. However, many outbreaks have occurred within populations that have been fully immunized, and some research points to the vaccination program as the instigator of outbreaks.</p>
<p>Supporting statistics for this phenomenon include:</p>
<p>2009: over two dozen cases of pertussis in Hunterdon County, New Jersey; all the children infected had been immunized prior to contracting the illness</p>
<p>1994: measles outbreak in Cincinnati; 80% of the children involved had had at least three doses of the vaccine</p>
<p>1989: 2,720 reported cases of measles nationally; 72.5% (1,972 of them) occurred in those who were vaccinated</p>
<p>1989: measles outbreak in a high school in Illinois; 69 cases, 99.7% occurred in those who were vaccinated</p>
<p>1987: CDC reported 2,440 cases of measles among vaccinated children</p>
<p>1986: measles outbreak in Corpus Christi, TX; 99% occurred in children who had been vaccinated</p>
<p>1986: in Kansas; 1,300 cases of pertussis were reported; 90% occurred in those who were vaccinated</p>
<p>1984, measles outbreak at a high school in Waltham, Massachusetts; 27 cases, 98% had documented proof of vaccination against the measles</p>
<p>1971, a rubella epidemic in Casper, Wyoming; 84% (91 of the 125 cases) occurred in vaccinated children</p>

        <p>I’m American and have never gotten a flu shot. A lot of people don’t.</p>
<p>I have all the regular childhood vaccines against hepatitis B, MMR, etc and I got the HPV vaccine when I was a teenager but I haven’t had one in like 15 years. I should probably get a tetanus booster again because it’s recommended every 10 years but I’m not that worried about it.</p>
<p>I don’t want the covid vaccine though.</p>

        <p>I get my DTaP every decade and still got a horrible Pertussis bug one of those years. I was still coughing nine months later. Apparently the P in DTaP doesn't protect from all of the strains, just like most of the vaccines don't 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

        <p>Yes, the flu or common cold isn't a problem for healthy people.</p>
<p>However, flu shots are recommended for people who are immunocompromised, elderly with health issues, and otherwise healthy people who will be spending a lot of time with people in the aforementioned categories.</p>
<p>But for most people, flu shots aren't needed.</p>

        <p>Most of the time we have to pay for them ourselves, sometimes our employers will pay for them and once I had a job that actually gave me a giftcard to take it. But the last two are probably only because I work in the medical field caring for the elderly.</p>

        <p>If you are healthy you don't need a drug, that's what I mean. That's what healthy means actually. You are healthy for the environment you're in. For example if you feel cold you put a jacket on, that means you are not healthy for that cold environment, in other words you cannot withstand the stress of that environment and you need one or more "helpers". And that's different for everyone of us.</p>

        <p>I can fight a flu just fine if I catch it. I'd just rather not catch it. This year there was no vaccine available for me so I didn't get it. That's fine, too. Still healthy.</p>

        <p>You don't catch it if you are "healthy" that's my point. You get no symptoms at all, nothing happens. Flu is just another environmental stressor. Pollen is another, etc. I prefer to measure my physical levels, that tells me where I stand at any point in time. Physical levels must be steady, consistent while deviations in physical levels mean deep trouble. There are lots of signals, way before sickness manifests itself.</p>

        <p>Never had a flu shot, had the flu maybe once? Fine with having it again. Had Covid once, won’t get the shot- fine with having it again. My immune system kicks ass</p>

        <p>That's exactly why I don't get flu shots nor do I let my child get them. It doesn't stop my job (NOT working with the public whatsoever) from asking me to sign an opt-out waiver for flu vaccine every single year.</p>
