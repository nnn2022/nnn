    <strong>Why are trolls coming to this sub obsessed with masks?</strong>
    <p><p>Every single troll post goes "Why don't you wear a mask?"</p>
<p>I am yet to see a single troll asking "Why don't you love lockdowns?"</p>
<p>There is no "mask" in the name of this sub, nor in the tagline nor the "About" section, so why are those losers so obsessed with it?</p></p>

        <p>In order to justify their own compliance (nobody is the bad guy in their own story, we all think we’re the protagonist), they seek to ridicule anything that doesn’t fit into the world view that they have adopted. It helps make their reality make sense to them. They have to make people like you the villains in their story, because that way they don’t have to critically analyze their own beliefs and the things they’re told. There’s some of it on both sides of this issue by the way, but at the end of the day it’s just one of the more unfortunate aspects of human nature that we all share.</p>
<p>Edit: with regard to the mask issue specifically, I think that’s just the easiest straw man for them to argue. They can say way more about how “masks don’t even inconvenience you!”, and “how selfish are you that you can’t put a piece of cloth over your face to save lives?”, than they can defend things like lockdown orders.</p>

        <p>I like to ask them why in the thousands of years that humans have had textiles and battled respiratory diseases that no one figured out until this pandemic that sticking cloth on your face worked to stop disease spread. Everyone acts like it's some miracle of science that we only discovered in the 2010s that cloth masks block spit so they must stop diseases spreading.</p>

<p>Note that the corona virions are much smaller than the influenza virions, so if masks failed with the latter, they are  destined to fail with the former.</p>

        <p>That's not really true. Quarantine was in use during the Black Death in the 14th century and that's still the basis of our modern social distancing policies. The first vaccine was from about 1796. If putting fabric on our faces was effective, it would have definitely been discovered by now.</p>

        <p>They had a bunch of theories about how the Black Death was spread:</p>
<p>Ruby quartz eyes in plague doctor outfits protected the from light wave affecting their humors </p>
<p>Some believed it was through smell (pockets full of posey - a fragrant flower was used to cover ones nose when in plague quarters)</p>
<p>The flagellists believed this was punishment from God so beat themselves to show penance - and created wounds for the most deadly form of the disease (septacaemic)</p>
<p>Also not a water vapour disease but one of proximity.</p>

        <p>You were kinda on the right track, but you got bogged down in the weeds.</p>
<p>&rt; They can say way more about how “masks don’t even inconvenience you!”, and “how selfish are you that you can’t put a piece of cloth over your face to save lives?”, than they can defend things like lockdown orders.</p>
<p>It's not about 'defending' lockdown orders. Masks, social distancing, and lockdown orders are all control measures designed to do the same thing: stop or slow the spread of the virus. They're arranged in a sort of 'hierarchy'.</p>
<p>The first, most basic measure is the social distancing. If everyone stayed far enough apart to 100% prevent the spread through close contact, we wouldn't need any other measures. (Whatever that distance is, whether it's 2m, more, less, doesn't matter for the sake of this explanation). Obviously, it is not possible for all 7bn of us to be apart all the time, so social distancing as a singular measure is not good enough.</p>
<p>Next is masks. When everyone wears a mask (properly), it reduces the likelihood of transmission from being in close proximity to others. Again, this measure is not perfect, but in conjunction with social distancing, it's a pretty effective combo.</p>
<p>Next is sanitizing of hands/surfaces/not touching our faces with unwashed hands, etc. This is a kind of 'last line of defense' before the virus enters our bodies. It isn't really it's own 'level' of control because we're doing it all the time anyway, we're just more on top of it now.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are the broad control measure that is implemented when adherence to the others is not sufficient to contain the spread of the virus. The first one in March was mostly preemptive - we knew it would be bad, so we locked down to try to prevent it from taking hold. It worked - until everyone went back to normal right after it ended. Then the virus kicked into high gear.</p>
<p>So we tried ramping up the less severe control measures, because they have less of an impact on people. Due to a lack of adherence to the basic measures, and to much of a delay in implementing them consistently, the virus took hold anyway. Now, we need a lockdown to drastically reduce person-to-person contact and starve the virus of transmission routes. This is why a coordinated lockdown is needed - if only some areas lockdown, you'll end up with hotspots that keep bouncing around. This type of lockdown does not work. It needs to be across the board, and long enough to allow active cases to fizzle out.</p>
<p>Think of these control measures like a car's safety system - you've good good tires and brakes to help you stop, but you've also got crumple zones. You've got seatbelts. You've got airbags.</p>
<p>In manufacturing, quality management systems use a "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Swiss+cheese+model&amp;client=ms-android-samsung-gs-rev1&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02GlohPMO91VJbfiiuRqdIL7l4Fiw:1606442562399&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzl6Ly0KHtAhUUJTQIHf6jByYQ_AUoAXoECAwQAQ&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=667&amp;dpr=3">Swiss cheese</a>" model: all of the control measures have holes (i.e., none are perfect on their own). But, with enough layers, you are trying to make sure that there isn't a single continuous path through all the layers of cheese. </p>
<p>Nobody, and I mean <em>nobody</em>, actually <strong>likes</strong> masks. They fucking suck. I say this as a person who wears a mask every time I go into a store, I have to wear one at work when I leave my desk. It sucks balls, it truly does. Lockdowns are even worse. I hate them. I want them to end. But I don't want people to die. So I'll wear a mask and suffer in solitude away from concerts, festivals, most friends, etc, until we get the ultimate control measure: widespread vaccination.</p>
<p>Another note: I fully recognize that an opportunity like this is a <strong><em>great</em></strong> time for a despot to seize power under the guise of public safety. We need to buy aware of that threat at all times, no matter who is in power. It's happened before and it can happen again. I just don't think that's what's happening. If we don't see an easing of restrictions back towards normal life as we reach widespread vaccination, we riot. Heads roll. </p>
<p>Final thought: I know this is long, but I poured my heart into it, and I'm typing on my phone. If you made it through, thanks. Please feel free to reply and let me know what you think, be it agreement or disagreement.</p>

        <p>You obviously care a great deal about lockdowns. To honor your dedication, allow me to respond (also from my phone keyboard):</p>
<p>From the perspective of many on this sub, locking down, like communism, is susceptible in its exponents to the No True Scotsman fallacy. I’ll ask: if the kinds of global lockdowns you propose don’t yield the results you want, will there be a point at which you recognize that they cannot be implemented? Or will belief in the validity of the theory continue to win out over recognition of the reality?</p>
<p>Most of us here complied with initial lockdowns happily—or at least dutifully—only to be told that it wasn’t enough. The damage to our businesses, our (kids’) educations, our lives would have to be extended indefinitely until nobody dies... is hospitalized... gets sick. The goalposts moved while we were told that our pain wasn’t enough. As law abiding citizens, there is anger here at the inconsistency with which expectations are applied to different groups of people. We are tired of having our civil rights impinged upon by an ideology for which the perfect (no sickness) is often the enemy of the realistic (little sickness, businesses open, those with conditions stay home, schools blended and at-will).</p>
<p>Hopefully you understand that this isn’t just an “I do what I want” sub. Rather, we are just trying to get by and don’t want a world where what we have seen recently in terms of civil rights abuse is normalized in the name of keeping us safe. There is no limit to that slippery slope, should a government choose to pursue it.</p>

        <p>&rt; if the kinds of global lockdowns you propose don’t yield the results you want, will there be a point at which you recognize that they cannot be implemented? </p>
<p>Yes. The goal is to not have lockdowns. In order to be effective, lockdowns should be as short as possible while still achieving their goals (stopping/greatly slowing the spread of the virus). If lockdowns continue indefinitely, people get complacent and the effectiveness quickly recedes, while the harmful effects continue.</p>
<p>&rt; Most of us here complied with initial lockdowns happily—or at least dutifully—only to be told that it wasn’t enough. The damage to our businesses, our (kids’) educations, our lives would have to be extended indefinitely until nobody dies... is hospitalized... gets sick. The goalposts moved while we were told that our pain wasn’t enough. As law abiding citizens, there is anger here at the inconsistency with which expectations are applied to different groups of people.</p>
<p>I think as this year fades into memory over the coming years and decades, one thing that almost everyone will agree on is just how ineffective governments were. Indecisiveness, half-baked measures, and an inability to commit to something (anything) for fear of the political fallout from taking a decision that's unpopular (but may have been very effective, if done early enough).</p>
<p>I also think that there was a complete failure of communication early on. The messaging started with "masks don't work", which was ostensibly just a ploy to keep the available mask stock free for use by medical professionals.</p>
<p>This fundamentally ruined the public trust in government messaging from the outset, and rightly so. It's a big reason why there's such a big divide between "maskers and anti-maskers", and we're all worse off because of it.</p>
<p>&rt; Hopefully you understand that this isn’t just an “I do what I want” sub. Rather, we are just trying to get by and don’t want a world where what we have seen recently in terms of civil rights abuse is normalized in the name of keeping us safe. There is no limit to that slippery slope, should a government choose to pursue it.</p>
<p>Understood. I know there are a lot of reasonable people opposed to the various measures for various reasons. Ultimately, the public all wants the same thing - return to a world without covid countermeasures. This includes people who support masks, lockdowns, etc. There were things that weren't perfect before, but the covid response has caused a lot of pain. Covid itself has caused a lot of pain as well. Lockdowns have caused a lot of pain.</p>
<p>These measures are meant to be temporary. If they are not, we have failed.</p>

        <p>Except many are not taking the vaccine. Given the vaccine's supposed efficacy, why should the public not IMMEDIATELY go back to normal once vaccination is possible? </p>
<p>Additionally, there is no evidence for any of these measures contributing to lower spread. Does that not bother you?</p>
<p>We have destroyed the economy for years so old people can live another six months. Does that not as well?</p>

        <p>Yes! I had a troll comment on everything I commented on that was covid related for 3 days in a row. </p>
<p>He kept trying to argue that the mask works when I’ve literally never said anything otherwise. I don’t care about the mask. I’m anti-lockdown.</p>

        <p>Normally I’d agree, but the way they were responding makes me think it’s a person. He discovered me on an askreddit post about masks. I gave my opinion, it triggered him, and he tried to argue with me on anything covid related lol until he got banned from the sub.</p>
<p>His post history is something else too. Questions range from “why won’t conservatives debate me” to “my wife says taking a poop after child birth feels different. Is this true?”</p>

        <p>They seem to think it's all about the masks. It's not about the masks. If I had to guess I'd say at least half of the people on this sub wear one on occasion. I know I'll wear one because I don't want to pay a fine and it seems to make people more comfortable and I'm happy to indulge their psychosis. This sub seems to mostly be against blind obedience without question and the fear, paranoia and rhetoric the media and the majority of this website have been campaigning.</p>

        <p>Because there's been a push to paint anyone who doesn't fall in line as a crazy, Trump-supporting, low IQ, gun nut, conspiracy theorist, selfish immature whiner who only cares about wearing a mask because the gubmint told him to so he won't.</p>
<p>People have bought into that narrative so they literally see us as that. They don't listen and don't realize they aren't listening. The thinking's been done for them ahead of time.</p>
<p>New label I saw today is "spreader". I expect this will catch on quickly, like COVidiot. Anyone who doesn't mask up is literally diseased and spreading COVID everywhere. So you too, if you oppose any health measures, are an anti-masker and therefore a diseased spreader.</p>

        <p>Masks have always been the biggest sticking point as far as Covid restrictions go. It’s the people with the lowest risk tolerances (the ones who wore them long belong before mask mandates became a thing) telling politicians that if they’re going to wear a mask at all times, so should everyone else. The act of people simply breathing has become triggering to them.</p>

        <p>I was wearing masks in February. N95 mind you, not face diapers. I stopped when government began threatening to initiate violence against me if I choose not to. I'll resume wearing N95 masks when government stops threatening violence against me, if I believe there is still a risk from the virus or absent government violence and coercion a business mandates it on their property.</p>
<p>I have never advocated government initiate violence against peaceful people, I have spent much of my vehemently opposing it and supporting groups that work toward a limited and Constitutional government that does not violate our natural rights.</p>

        <p>They're part of a deliberate narrative control effort on Reddit. They are summoned by "mask" as a keyword in a thread title. Most have never posted in the sub before, and have little activity on their profiles. </p>
<p>You can make the exact same post and replace "mask" with another word and you will get a reply count that is on average for the sub. But when you use the magic "mask" keyword, you get swarmed. </p>
<p>Pay attention on Reddit long enough and you'll get a sense for what's on the secret list of keywords that summons the bully brigade. </p>

        <p>Because no person could possibly justify the price of lockdowns to society in a fair discussion, so they try to turn the lockdown argument against us by postulating that masks would prevent lockdowns. The latter is false on two levels. </p>
<p>First, it is not a trade that anyone ever offers, nobody says if you wear a mask we will not close schools and businesses. So even if we would agree to wear masks (which those of us living in places that require them probably do), but even if we all did, they'd still want to mess with closing arbitrary institutions. So the "only masks, no lockdowns" option is never on the table. </p>
<p>The second fallacy is more difficult to argue, and it is that with masks we would have such low spread of the virus that lockdowns would become unnecessary. This is clearly not the case as shown by many places where mask compliance alone has no significant effect; to see any effect on infection spread many additional measures need to be taken, and masks are only seen as a complementary measure. I've seen people write "if only you wore masks we would not need to lock down", but that claim is simply not supported by any data at all.</p>
<p>As you see masks go together with lockdowns like a horse and carriage. Therefore it is disingenuous to attack people for refusing to virtue signal with masks while at the same time denying that you support the fascist, inhumane, and deranged policy of locking society down.</p>

        <p>The “Why don’t you wear a mask?” ask dance is one of the main reasons why I don’t. It’s my face and it’s none of your business. And if you try to tell me that public health is everybody’s business, then I’m banning with tv, sugary and fried foods and I’m making it mandatory to not be obese. If someone is trying to put the burden of responsibility on me without the ability to make any decisions in regards to it, then that’s simply scapegoating! And I draw a hard boundary there believe you me.</p>

        <p>Well probably because most people that are against lockdowns are not a fan of masks. Or how there was a post a little while ago where a young man stood his ground at work to refuse wearing one. </p>

        <p>It's because it's a lot easier to argue in favor of masks than to argue in favor of other restrictions currently in place, like forced business closures, the shutdown of the school system, and the ban on religious gatherings.</p>
<p>By making the discussion only about masks, they can more easily ignore the massive costs associated with lockdowns and mobility restrictions.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn't mind wearing a mask if I saw evidence that they worked, but so far I haven't. In fact, I started wearing a mask around July because I thought they might work and make the pandemic go away, but they didn't. So now I just wear masks where they are mandatory.</p>

        <p>I’ve noticed this too. They don’t seem to attack when it comes to questioning lockdowns but question the effectiveness of masks and they get triggered and respond with a profanity-laced tirade about how terrible of a person you are. In society in general, there seems to be a rationale that if you question masks, you are a very bad person. It automatically diminishes a person’s character even if they know nothing about that person.</p>

        <p>Right?!? I don't get it. Everybody assumes we're all horrible anti-masking murderers. Like, not only is none of that an accurate statement about those who don't wear masks, but that's not even what this subreddit is about...my impression is that this is just a group of people who want everything to go back to normal as soon as possible/don't think the coronavirus is quite as serious as it's being hyped up to be/don't understand some of the rules surrounding it. I wear my mask...I'll pull it down sometimes, especially when nobody's around, and I definitely don't wear it at home/in the car/outside, but I wear it, just because I'd rather not deal with any coronavirus extremists bullying me/physically assaulting me. But I think this entire thing is ridiculous, shutting down the entire country for eight months/ruining millions and millions of people's lives was incredibly unnecessary and extremely selfish, and certain things don't make sense to me at all, i.e. why is shopping at the grocery store okay but spending Thanksgiving with your family not okay?</p>

        <p>I can answer that. I'm against the lockdowns in the absence of more stimulus. That's my buggaboo. </p>
<p>I'm also pro-mask, and I will get the vaccine. So I came here about the lockdown part, and have since engaged with some people who have different views than I do about masks and vaccines.</p>
<p>I don't see why that's a problem. There's all manner of people contributing here, including real nutjobs who think COVID is caused by 5G or that the virus doesn't even exist.</p>
<p>It's good to have some back and forth. For me, it's helped me to realize that my experiences with the virus and restrictions in Los Angeles are not universal, and that many parts of the country have even more ridiculous restrictions while simultaneously having fewer deaths. That, in turn, has helped me to understand why some people have embraced such desperate mental escapes as believing in far-fetched conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>That’s exactly why the right stance is flat opposition to lockdowns.</p>
<p>&rt; “I’m okay with government doing X subject to this condition.”</p>
<p>You never, ever to get to set conditions in reality. Your condition is irrelevant. You will never get to insist that lockdowns come with financial aid - if the government can do lockdowns, they can do them on ANY terms that they want. </p>
<p>Even if you were in a country that implemented lockdowns <em>with</em> ample financial aid provided to everyone, you’d be foolish to support their power to impose lockdowns. You create a precedent that the government can impose lockdowns, but your condition isn’t a necessary element of that power; next time we have a bad flu season and they want to impose lockdowns <em>without</em> providing financial aid, you’ll have only yourself to blame.  </p>
<p>Unless you have unconditional support for the government having power to do X (including in ways of which you disapprove), it is foolish and short-sighted to support it at all.</p>

        <p>The word "mask" is being filtered and targeted which is being subtly endorsed by this sub becasue they are allowing clear violations without any repercussion.  Anytime masks are discussed you will instantly have a multitude of trolls attacking and assaulting not only the comment or post but the commenter and poster themselves, using ridicule, belittlement and highly inflammatory and derogatory language without providing any material substance whatsoever to support their "stance"</p>
<p>I recently made a post covering a more discrete hazardous health effect that masks can potentially cause and within less than a minute seconds I had 8 comments  that were nothing more than verbal attacks. I am speculating that based on the way reddit works with the downvote system, my post will remain pretty much hidden from the masses in this sub due it being instantly rated so low. </p>
<p>If you try and post anything in opposition to the Sub narrative in an alternate sub, despite any amount of material evidence, you will in all likelihood be banned, but for some reason, anyone can come into these threads (especially r/conspiracy) and attack people at will..</p>

<p>All they do is post masks are muzzles and keep quoting george Orwell like they dont work at denny's &amp; walmart. Eveeeerryyoone else is a sheep and they're the only smart ones in the room. </p>
<p>I dont get it! Why would these people refuse to wear masks, enabling the pandemic, and prolonging business closures. I just dont get it, dont they want this to end ?</p>

        <p>The fact that you HONESTLY think wearing a mask will genuinely stop all the nonsense shows how much you "dont get." The vast majority are wearing masks but the numbers are going up as quickly as they were before, if not quicker. If masks worked these numbers would either be stabilising or decreasing, but that's not happening is it</p>
