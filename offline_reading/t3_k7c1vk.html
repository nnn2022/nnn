    <strong>This is what we’re doing to our kids</strong>
    <p><p>I commented earlier on another post<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/k4nkgw/last_night_my_teenage_child_said_everything_about/gearerp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3">comment </a>. </p>
<p>Here is an update. My son was released from the inpatient psychiatric facility on 14 Nov. This Thursday, while on a Zoom chat with his therapist, he said he was still thinking of killing himself. So now he’s back to another inpatient facility. One big problem is that since everything is shut down, most of his social support has disappeared, no school, no friends, no social activities to get him out of the house. </p>
<p>I am absolutely furious with everyone in love with their corona fear. The average American has a 99.8% chance of surviving a COVID infection. I am terrified that my son’s chances of survival are significantly lower should he actually act on these thoughts. </p>
<p>If (God forbid) he follows through on this, I will never forgive the state and local governments who made these panicked decisions out of unreasonable fear. Get your heads on straight people and take a good look at the damage you are doing. Because I promise, my kid isn’t the only one and you are destroying far more than the corona virus ever will.</p></p>

        <p>This is right.  We are close to making that decision.  4 hours in one direction and 45 min in the other and life is far more normal for the kids.  That’s in insanity.  We border two states with open school and no different figures.</p>

        <p>You are right.  Your advice is direct and may seem too much so to some but it’s critically accurate.  We can not take for granted the depth of pain our kids may be fighting right now.  </p>
<p>One of mine suffered a brain infection just over 1 year ago.  Spent the winter in and out of the children’s hospital.  Just as she emerged was when schools shut down last spring.  So she’s been away from kids for over a year and is suffering.  The situation right now couldn’t possibly be worse for her and many others for similar reasons.  All of her continued therapies and recover programs were effectively shut down and the kids were ejected.  She’s just begging to see friends again.  So, we are planning a big logistical pile of shit for our family because we are scared for her.  </p>
<p>Hard not to be very pissed off every day...</p>

<p>As someone who gave up a lot to move across the country because of my own suicidal thoughts, I highly recommend doing this. Now the state I came from has one of the strictest lockdowns in the country and I don’t regret a thing because I don’t know if I would have made it otherwise.</p>

        <p>The half assed education they're getting is also going to stunt their educational growth as well. So we're basically allowing a whole generation to be even <em>more</em> poorly educated, which is going to really set this countries future back. Maybe permanently.</p>

        <p>Look at the news! A fitness instructor in California decapitated his 12 and 13 old children! I suspect he'd lost his mind, virtually imprisoned in his house with no work, no school for the children, no social activities. Maybe he killed them to save them from a world gone mad. We're all nuts if we continue to let a virus destroy the social fabric of our society. Even during the polio scare of the nineteen forties and fifties, they did not close down the world. There were local closures of swimming pools and other public gathering places for short periods of time, but overall people were allowed to decide for themselves what precautions to take. And, polio was far more dangerous than this virus. WAKE UP PEOPLE AND TAKE YOUR LIVES BACK!</p>

        <p>I’m around your sons age and it’s super tough for us right now. But I think you’re being a good parent because you are concerned and realizing that the threat isn’t covid. I would definitely move (like the other commenters are saying) and maybe find a hobby you two can do together. Obviously the hobby won’t fix things but it’s nice to do stuff like that. And if you live somewhere warm or relocate to somewhere warm then send him to a skatepark because most of the kids there aren’t doomers and are also usually very nice. It’s the one place where I feel like a kid and not like I’m in a dystopian movie</p>

        <p>Both of my parents currently have COVID (I don’t live with them, so I never got it) and neither of them has had a single symptom.  The only reason they ever knew they had it was because they went to get tested last week just for the hell of it.  They’re both completely fine and almost done with their quarantine.  In addition, five of my cousins have it (from different places) and both my friend’s grandparents currently have it.  The only one that has any symptoms at all is my friend’s grandmother, and that symptom is a cough.  </p>
<p>I don’t deny that COVID is out there and it kills many vulnerable people, but this response is well beyond out of control at this point.  I wish for speedy recovery for your son and some normalcy that’s soon to come.</p>

        <p>Like the other posters, I feel terrible for you and your son.  My family lives in Florida so it isn't as bad as other areas, but it is still worse than most realize.  Contact tracing in schools is a thing, and it has weird ripple effects.  For example, parents who don't believe in lockdowns are still reluctant to let their kids visit because they don't want to get quarantined for two weeks.  Also, teachers aren't allowed to eat lunch together so they are going nuts too.  This isn't out of fear.  It's just that if one teacher is exposed, the county would have to quarantine every teacher they were in contact with, and they can't find enough subs to cover them all.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm trying to stay sane by reminding myself that we are living through the most interesting time period in the human timeline.  Try connecting it with a story your son might like.  This is The Matrix.  This is Avatar the Last Airbender.  This is Cowboy Bebop.  This is Braveheart.  And obviously, this is The Bible (and Quran).  It doesn't give me hope, but it does help me appreciate the fact that I have a front row seat for a show that billions (probably trillions) of people weren't able to enjoy.</p>

        <p>I oppose much of the medical industry - including mental health services - so I can't say I agree with sending anyone to a psychiatric facility. However, our options are all particularly limited right now, and you're doing your best with what resources you have available. The assholes in the comments below are absolutely worthless pieces of shit, even the ones as young as your son. Maybe they'll grow up and wake up, maybe they won't, but they're just as guilty of spreading mass hysteria and supporting authoritarian policies as any adult in the government, media, medical industry, or whatever other sector of scumbags pushing the "deadly virus" narrative over a new strain of common cold. I'll shut up now before I say something I really shouldn't.</p>

        <p>I don’t know where you live but some states aren’t as locked down so move immediately. Better for your son to have to find new friends and go to a new school than to have these thoughts. Where I am some schools are hybrid so that helps. Churches are mostly open. Restaurants are open. 
If moving isn’t an option I suggest you find something, anything, that your son can get involved in. Boy Scouts, church, sports, anything.</p>

        <p>I know not one person who as died from COVID, however I have lost a 22 year old step daughter becasue of the lockdowns, and a couple other young people in the community who have died as a result of  progressing from casual drug usage to habitual and the introduction of much more lethal drugs that ended in overdoses. </p>
<p>The sick thing is they know exactly what they are doing, they are killing people and then celebrating their deaths wit their ear to ear grins introducing even more lethal measures. These  people are the epitome of sociopaths and need to be stopped.</p>

        <p>No matter how much time or money a parent has at their disposal, they can't provide a young person with what they need most of all to remain mentally healthy - life experiences and genuine human connections. How could you possibly blame the parent in this situation??</p>

        <p>Parents don't take responsibility for thier kids.  They want to blame society, or the media, or the school system, or the government. They like to talk about all they have done and hope to issue a sympathetic "there was nothing you could do."
My contention, is that there was, and likely is, and you didn't do it, you know you didn't and you should take responsibility for that.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that there are many parents who don't take responsibility for their kids, and many people who are simply not fit to be parents, but honestly what do you expect the parents to do in this situation? You can buy the kid any number of material goods, and you as a parent can spend time with them, but how do you replicate the experience of social activities? People need a larger social circle than immediate family, and they need social experiences that family cannot provide (the kinds of activities you do with your parents are very different to the kinds of activities you do with your friends).</p>

        <p>Lol imagine spending 9 months telling people to "stay the fuck at home" and scolding people for relatively benign behaviors like going to the park, and then when they complain that their kids are fucking suicidal, saying "why didn't you just take them places and do stuff with them??"  Cognitive dissonance in action right here.</p>
