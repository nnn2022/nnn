    <strong>They are ready to call us hypocrites once the vaccines receive FDA approval</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t think I’ve heard anybody say “I’ll take it once it is fully FDA approved.” I’ve only seen it mentioned in the form of, “it’s not <em>even</em> FDA approved,” as an obvious issue on a list of numerous reasons to be skeptical, not the sole reason to avoid it. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ojtwvb/misinformation_posters_are_out_in_full_force/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">example</a>)</p>
<p>Of course I’m going to find approval meaningless when it is achieved quicker than any other vaccine in history. I think most of the “hesitant” have been clear about this from the start, yet they say that we will “move the goal posts” and find new excuses to resist. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oje0ka/fauci_says_he_would_be_astounded_if_pfizer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">source</a>)</p>
<p>Note that there are several comments from people who didn’t realize that it never had full FDA approval in the first place. There’s also a ton of people correctly pointing out that there’s no way that the FDA can back out now without forever losing the trust of the public.</p>
<p>Anyway I’m just sick of the smugness and the fact that they aren’t really listening to people’s concerns.</p></p>

        <p>That's why I always said not to push the argument about the vaccines not being FDA approved.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that the vaccines would be approved sooner or later.</p>

        <p>I think the lack of long term studies is a huge issue for most people, and approval without that information isn’t going to resolve their concerns. Vaccine pushers hate that there’s no way around the passage of time that people want to see</p>

<p>I've seen people here and at LDS say this, though. "Once it gets FDA approval, I'll get back to you" and comments like that. </p>
<p>I also find FDA approval pointless. It's going to get approved no matter what. Thousands could die of x side effect, and they'll still push it through. It was "FDA approved" before the vaccine ever saw the light of day.</p>

        <p>FDA approval or not, I see people consistently with side effects (or just outright getting <em>the coof</em> after getting the shot.) I'll pass. I had covid, it's a headcold for 20 somethings of average weight and my lifestyle is EXTREMELY sedentary. This is a new cold/flu, which, if I remember before insanity struck the world... the elderly and obese were more at risk for anyways. Just lop it onto the cold/flu season title and be done with it. This isn't ebola or bubonic plague.</p>

        <p>Someone changing their mind doesn't equate to being a hypocrite.</p>
<p>Before the vaccine came out, my position was, if needed, I wouldn consider the vaccine a year or so after FDA approval.</p>
<p>Since then, the vaccine has become available, and as I sat and watched, I've seen propaganda, lies, bribery, coercion, misinformation from the WH and MSM regarding the publicly available data. I've seen a country be manipulated and divided. I've watched what should have been a humanitarian mission turn into a control mechanism.</p>
<p>I've learned about a very clear Agenda at the cost of Americans freedoms and liberties, our democracy being chipped away, by our own administration, our "leaders". For a NGO. </p>
<p>Our government is acting in the interests of a NGO.</p>
<p>Real estate prices are through the roof. Private equity firms and the wealthy are buying up real estate, driving prices high, that most Americans can't afford to compete with the over market value cash offers. Blackrock (and I'm sure others) is/are systematically bulk buying real estate in the US and Canada. And our government is letting it happen, while the MSM tries to spin this idea/narrative that Americans want to be renters and don't want to own a home.</p>
<p>So, my position has changed quite a bit. Fuck the vaccine. This administration is trash and the worst thing to ever happen to this country.</p>
<p>Does that make me a hypocrite?</p>

<p>&rt;##The Food and Drug Bandits</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”This Bureau — now known as the Food &amp; Drug Administration — is used primarily for the perversion of justice by "cracking down" on all who endanger the profits of the Drug Trust.</strong> The Bureau occasionally prosecutes, on its own initiative, smalltime opportunists who should be prosecuted. Thus in a few small cases the Bureau does good work.</p>
<p>&rt;Its principal activities, however, are as servants of the Drug Trust.” ^1</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Control of the Food and Drug Administration, health departments and other government agencies have given the Rockefeller Drug Cartel a virtual monopoly of marketing of drugs, especially of new drugs.”</strong> ^2:112</p>
<p>&rt;”The Food &amp; Drug Administration was converted by the Drug Trust into a device that would leave them <strong>free to engage in any type of skulduggery with impunity,</strong> but would enable them to drive competitors out of business by hampering regulations and excessive expense involved in compliance with arbitrary rulings and harassments.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”One of the officers of Schering Co., an affiliate of the Drug Trust, openly has stated that the maintenance of a drug monopoly is one of the objectives of the Food &amp; Drug Administration.”</strong> ^2:119</p>

        <p>It's another gaslighting tactic. FDA approval was never a condition for the majority of people who haven't taken it yet, but it's another way to gaslight our side by claiming we're "moving goalposts" when the other side has literally moved the goalposts every day.</p>

        <p>With full fda approval wouldn't companies then be liable for any injuries? Whats the cost benefit analysis for these companies then? Would they be able to make enough money to balance out potential lawsuits? Now with people already vaxxed they don't have any legal recourse and that's allegedly most of the population so perhaps it's still economically beneficial (to big pharma) to receive full fda approval. But why would they take that risk of potential legal issues? I think there's still a chance that full fda approval will not be granted.</p>

        <p>Lack of FDA approval is just one of many reasons to say no. If it gets approved, it doesn't negate all the other reasons.</p>
<p>&rt;There’s also a ton of people correctly pointing out that there’s no way that the FDA can back out now without forever losing the trust of the public.</p>
<p>No? How about this:</p>
<p>2017 October 23</p>
<p>Center for Health Security releases risk communications exercise scenario focused on medical countermeasures in a pandemic</p>
<p>* Written in 2017, fictional pandemic scenario</p>
<p>* Refers to the vice president taking office after President Jaclyn Bennett (J.B.) doesn't run for a second term due to health reasons (Who does that sound like? How did they know he would be president in 2017?)</p>
<p>* Pandemic that doesn't kill as many people as originally expected (Covid-19?)</p>
<p>* Vaccines have severe side effects (Happening now!)</p>
<p>* <strong>Ends with the President apologizing to the brave and patriotic Americans that took these experimental and harmful vaccines during a time of national crisis.</strong></p>

<p>This is from the same people who brought us Event 201. In fact, it predated Event 201. Event 201 was meant to frighten people, and if you actually watch it you'll see it leaves out the other half of the scenario which is covered in the SPARS Pandemic Document ((that the virus isn't the killer -- the vaccines are.))</p>
<p>PS. Who's the conspiracy theorist? Me for reading that or them for writing it? :D</p>
