        <p>iNews UK: <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/science/long-covid-diagnosis-gp-react-study-1078809?ITO=newsnow">Official long Covid cases a tiny fraction of scientific estimates, according to GP records</a></p>
<p>&rt;GP records show 23,000 recorded cases of the illness, compared to 2 million cases estimated nationally, leading to questions over <strong>how such a large gap arose</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Long Covid may be much less common than previously feared, after an analysis of GP records found official cases of the condition were barely one hundredth the level suggested by scientific studies.</p>
<p>&rt;The most significant scientific study, known as REACT and published last week, indicated that about 2 million people in the UK currently have the condition and that 38 per cent of Covid patients have symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks.</p>
<p>&rt;By contrast, a “pseudonymised” analysis of 57.9 million GP records in England has found only 23,273 cases ever formally recorded between February 2020 and April 2021, in a sample covering 96 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>&rt;“We were very surprised to see almost a hundred-fold difference in prevalence between population survey estimates and formally recorded diagnoses for the same condition,” said Ben Goldacre, of Oxford University.</p>
<p>"Surprised" lol. Sure...</p>

        <p>So there have been 200,000+ of vaccine side effects according to the yellow card system.</p>
<p>Originally they said there would be 5% chance of long covid. So I did 5% of 4.7 million (total number of confirmed covid cases) so that means that only around 200,000 would get long covid. </p>
<p>Then take into account only 66% of people are symptomatic that number drops even lower to around 120,000. </p>
<p>Which means adverse vaccine effects are more likely than long covid. </p>
<p>So now they're saying 23,000. Well.. makes me think that there are large chunks of the population who haven't had tests therefore haven't officially had covid. But could have had it 'asymptomatically' which would make the long covid risk even lower. </p>
<p>But that's quite shocking that only 23,000 have long covid when you compare it to the side effects. </p>
<p>Remember too that only 35 people aged 20-25 died of covid in an entire year.</p>

        <p>Can't find the study. One thing I've seen is that every study the participants ages are around 50+, always have a look at that first. Same in the study that 'proved' that ivermectin had no effect. Some of the pre-existing conditions included cancer. These people were gonna die anyway. Just my 2 cents.</p>
