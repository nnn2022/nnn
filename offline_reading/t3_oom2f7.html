    <strong>University requirements for unvaccinated are a serious burden on my life, need help!</strong>
    <p><p>Hi I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this q but I'll give it a shot. I recently got an exemption from the vaccine because my university (in Maryland) requires it to return to campus. I'm technically a "full time student" but I'm actually going to be completing a full time internship far from campus, so I will not be there.</p>
<p>Despite this, they are requiring me to go to campus since I'm still a student, and PCR test twice a week. Not only would this be a serious burden on my busy schedule (i live 2 hours away from campus), I am generally opposed to this public health measure. In my exemption form, I was not told that this would be a part of the condition. I had a relatively easy time stating my rights with my exemption to the vaccine mandate, but I'm having trouble finding language related specifically to mandatory testing. </p>
<p>Does anyone have any resources that I could use to see if this is something I can fight against? I'm thinking about consulting with a lawyer that focuses on medical freedom but I'm not sure where to start. Thanks in advance!</p></p>
