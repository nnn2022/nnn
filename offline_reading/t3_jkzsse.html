    <strong>Discussion on UN’S reset conspiracy theory</strong>
    <p><p>I live outside of USA, but I am really interested in American politics. I think that something big is about happen in the world, just a possibility. It very well may not happen but it’s just one of those gut felling. When the covid outbreak was in earlier stage and my country was going in lockdown, i remember looking at USA and being like.....why are they being so lenient about this situation. I personally thought it was quit stupid of trump ( To be honest i don’t hate trump and like some policies as well but don’t 100% agree on what he says ) , but now few months have passed and now when I reflect back, the situation is clear that USA is doing better than most of the countries amidst chaos and recovering fast....while other countries are still issuing curfew orders. It really makes you think why USA is going a different route than other nations. I think that UN is up to some strange shit and the government’s are spreading fear purposely . Well i would like to hear opinions of both people living in USA and other countries</p></p>

        <p>Right now, here in the US there has never been such a stark divide. The election in a few days is a matter of freedom and tradition vs. total government control. </p>
<p>Biden has pledged that he is going to immediately impose a nationwide mask mandate, as well as shut the entire country and economy back down. Trump is making efforts to get us all back and working again, though most of this is really a state-level issue and not federal. It’s definitely an interesting time.</p>

        <p>Yeah it is quite interesting from an outsiders point of view as well. I don’t know much about inside situation but I think states like california are the main reason for the paranoia......constantly trying to project and inflict their views on the other states, maybe I’m wrong as i said I don’t know much about situation.</p>

        <p>A nationwide shutdown and/or mask mandate will be impossible to enforce. The feds don’t have the manpower or resources to enforce it. And getting state/local police to do so won’t happen. Governors like DeSantis and Noem will tell Biden to fuck off.</p>

        <p>Propaganda is deep here as well. Severity of govt restrictions depends on the state you're from and what party leads it. Leftists states  tend to default to bootlicking policies.</p>
