    <strong>Can Anyone Relate? (Office Mask Mandate) Are Sheer Masks the solution?</strong>
    <p><p>I have been making myself absolutely ILL over my company's mask mandate that says non-vaccinated people must wear masks. Admittedly it's the judgment from others I fear since 95% of my company is mask free. I wish people would have more empathy for us who choose not to vax and understand what it does to the psyche to be such a visual black sheep. And! It shouldn't technically be legal because if you're wearing a mask at ALL TIMES, you're basically a walking display of your medical information (Hi! I am NOT VAXXED) which is suppose to be private!! So how backwards is that?</p>
<p>I digress. For weeks I had been disregarding the rules and not masking. I was caught, and now have to wear a mask. Ever since then, my closest coworker has been policing me and giving me the cold shoulder like we're in HS now that she knows I've been breaking the rules. Since she knows the truth now, she, too, has been coming to work with a mask on. <em>"I feel like an absolute IDIOT for trusting that my fellow coworkers would follow the rules,"</em> she expressed to me. *eye roll* I guess she kinda is an idiot for that.</p>
<p>ANYWAY, I was reported all the way up to HR about my "behavior" which has made me feel naturally very shamed and embarrassed. So I have been working from home. Every time I try to go into the office and wear a mask, I end up leaving shortly after arriving out of utter emotional discomfort and feeling like I don't belong. I even tried to change my mindset and say to myself "this mask is a badge that I should wear proudly as it separates me from the heard of sheep blindly listening to the media." But that didn't prove very effective. It just feels like a punishment to have to cover my face. It feels shaming. absolutely shaming.</p>
<p>But here is my solution: I just bought the most paper-thin, sheer masks I could find on etsy, and I am hopeful this will give me more confidence at work. PLUS I am sure it will drive my mask-nazi coworker crazy. Can anyone else share their experience? How are you dealing with being the odd one out??</p></p>

        <p>I just don’t wear one and any time I’ve been asked about my vax status I just say I’m not divulging any of my medical info. Works like a charm. Not lying and also not telling the truth lol</p>

        <p>Do whatever you think is best for you. Personally I found sheer/mesh masks were very tolerable. Still hated the fact that I HAD to wear one in order to go into stores and to receive health care but at least when I wore the damn mask, I hardly felt it on my face and it didn’t affect my breathing or trigger my anxiety. The only time I’m the odd one out is when I go out ih public. Most here in my part of Commifornia are still wearing their masks (probably because the media here is really hyping up the sCaRy DeLtA vArIaNt. I don’t even look around at other people or think about masks now. I just walk right in and do what I gotta do. I’m the normal one. Remember your coworkers are the ones with the problem-they are vaccinated and still living in fear. They got a vaccine and don’t even realize it was all for nothing. They are still not free. I’d probably proudly wear a mesh mask if I was in your shoes but like I said, do whatever you think is best for you. There’s no wrong choice here.</p>

        <p>Once they get majority in the workplace making you wear a Mask and identifying your medical status, they will demand you Vaccinate as a term for continued employment, so you are going to end up in the same place.</p>
<p>Complying and playing along solves nothing.</p>

        <p>You can get a mesh mask with rhinestones on it on Amazon for $5 it passes very well and is completely breathable. Buy the black for best results. (I did get kicked out of the post office by an enormous woman, for the white one.) plus it’s bling and does t feel quite so punishing.</p>
