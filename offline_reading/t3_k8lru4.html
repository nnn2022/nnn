    <strong>My employer sends out a companywide email every time someone dies from COVID, and I can't help but think that I don't need to be told this</strong>
    <p><p>So far, three people in the organization where I work have died of COVID-19.  Every time this has happened, the CEO sends out a companywide email announcing that a person has died, and what department they worked in.  To provide some context, the organization where I work has around 14,000 employees in a large metropolitan area.  In getting the third one of these companywide emails today, I couldn't help but think that I don't care.  I don't need to be told every time someone in our organization drops dead from the Rona, and, in fact, I'd rather not know, because it's none of my business.  If I died of it, I wouldn't want them to announce my untimely passing.  They also don't send these sorts of companywide emails out if a colleague dies for another reason, such as in a car accident, or of natural causes.  Just COVID.</p>
<p>It especially bothers me because I feel like they're using these deaths to justify turning up the security theater, and as a result, making my job that much harder, and all the while, they're spouting the "We're all in this together" bullshit.  I just want to be left alone to do my job in peace.  My job isn't one that can be done remotely, and I wouldn't want to have one of those kinds of jobs anyway.</p>
<p>All in all, it's quite frustrating to have to deal with this sort of nonsense, especially when you realize that what they're sharing is doing nothing but stirring up the fear, and something that I don't need to be privy to in the first place.</p></p>

        <p>That's seriously messed up.  I think you're right, it's probably to justify the security theater.  I couldn't deal with that.</p>
<p>Maybe he should get some big, gothic bells to ring and black smoke too.  Nothing like making it a good show.</p>

        <p>Pretty much. The sense that I've gotten is that the highest ranks of our organization are doomers, and there is a very vocal minority in the rank-and-file that eats it right up. Some of those bozos in the latter group even suggested shutting down the system entirely because of this. My first thought was <em>fuck you</em>, because while they might be fine being unemployed, I need my job to live. Likewise, this same vocal minority is now scared to let passengers in through the front door of the buses (we have rear-door boarding currently), and also want to close off the first and last cars to passengers, ostensibly in the name of social distancing. All in all, it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>And the thing is, all of this has already made our ridership tank, without anyone in the organization contributing to it. We should be projecting normalcy, and showing that riding public transportation is completely safe, but instead, these idiots want to load it full of security theater it in order to make themselves feel better.</p>

        <p>That's awful.  Highest ranks will always have yes men to fortify their opinions, even dumb ones, but I don't understand tanking a business, sending those morbid emails, and instilling fear instead of confidence in both the employees and the customers.  What do doomers get out of this, I just don't understand it.  It's like they don't <em>want</em> things to be normal. They must be getting something from this that escapes me.  Do they get to tell the grandkids they survived the great covid or something?  It's so weird to me.  I'm not saying go lick door knobs and be stupid, but it's a flu. Maybe a bad one, I don't know, but a flu.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know how you can work there except that it's your job and it's probably no better at other places.  I used to hate being self employed with the bad pay and no benefits, but now I'm pretty grateful for it.</p>

<p>Union job with a real pension plan when I retire. You put up with a lot sometimes in order to have a defined-benefit pension for life. As such, most of the people in my organization, at least in the rank-and-file levels, are "lifers", and will work here for a few decades and then retire. This is not an organization where you work for a couple of years in order to get experience in order to get a better job. This organization is a career in and of itself.</p>

        <p>See, there you go, those are rare and I wouldn't leave either.  I know how much I put up with at my last job and I didn't have those stakes.  The money was good, but I hit my bs plateau and could walk.</p>
<p>I would suck it up, open the emails when they come, and make the best of it keeping that pension in mind.  Most jobs like that around here vanished a long time ago, before my time even.</p>

        <p>It’s okay not to care. I generally don’t care about strangers. I mean, it’s not like I wish bad things on them, and I surely am empathetic to the families, but I’m probably not going to have to take a mental health day or anything. </p>

        <p>It goes back to the World Economic Forum. These companies have formed a corporate syndicate and are under orders to persue several agendas (covid hysteria being one). I suppose measures are in place to punish companies that do not cooperate with the plan. What I'm suggesting is that your CEO might feel like he doesn't have a choice.</p>
