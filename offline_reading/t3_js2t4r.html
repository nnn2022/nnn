    <strong>What tipped you off that it was all bullshit: the data, or "intuition?"</strong>
    <p><p>My background: I worked in a molecular diagnostics company for a while, developing a integrated sample prep-to-qPCR device for various respiratory pathogens. When cootievirus started trickling into the news, the thing that set of my BS detector was the complaint about the lack of test kits for a NOVEL virus. I knew something was up because the clinical research process and submissions for even a well-characterized pathogen like H1N1 influenza A takes a year or more; for something new, it would take even longer.</p>
<p>Yet it wasn't my knowledge or experience that told me something was "off;" it was the general miasma of fear that swept the country overnight. First, my office started limiting office space, then they banned the lunch room, now I'm working from home. Nothing like this has ever been done for a virus, and now we are to believe that hundreds of millions are dying.</p>
<p>What did it for you?</p></p>

        <p>Both. I assumed, based on intuition, that the virus threat was being vastly exaggerated when we first got reports out of China. It was obvious that the videos of people falling over in the street were fake. I assumed it would all just blow over and the MSM would move on to something new. When things really started to ramp up in Italy, I spent a week basically doing nothing but researching covid and it became obvious from the mortality statistics from Italy, the comorbidities and studies such as the Diamond Princess that the threat was minimal. That was when my a lot of my former mates decided I was a deluded conspiracy theorist and were cowering in their houses posting on FB about selfish people having picnics in parks.  Then the world truly lost its shit and has not recovered if yet, or showing any sign of it.  My former friends sent me an email the other day telling me how wrong I was and what a great success lockdown has been - I just trashed it.</p>

        <p>Knowing that in October 2019, a 3.5-hour pandemic tabletop exercise was conducted called Event 201 backed by The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, World Economic Forum, and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
<p>Also reading the Rockefeller Lockstep document that was published in 2010, specifically page 18.</p>
<p>Both these things confirmed to me what this 'health crisis' was really about.</p>

        <p>Both. The hype - obviously fake Chinese videos, endless alarmist pieces on sites like Zero Hedge - prompted me to start looking for data. I found the <a href="https://swprs.org/covid19-facts/">Swiss Policy</a> website, videos from people like Sucharit Bhakdi, and began looking at the data coming out of places like the Chinese CDC and the Italian Ministry for Health. It was obvious that it was a flu-like illness and that the threat posed was predominantly to people of advanced age with multiple co-morbidities. I also remembered the H1N1 pandemic and was well aware that new pathogens always appear much worse at the start of an epidemic because we are seeing the most severely ill patients, not the submerged part of the iceberg consisting of mild and asymptomatic cases. I found it remarkable and alarming that epidemiologists and doctors appeared to have "forgotten" this simple fact (and many others).</p>
<p>The entire experience has been mind-boggling and frightening, but it's been fear solely of the reaction to the virus not the virus itself.</p>

        <p>I feel very much alone in Australia. There are a tiny number of skeptics here. Publicly, it's just a few people who would be considered on the far right. No doubt they're considered nutty, but to me they sound eminently normal and humane. It's a peculiar and troubling situation.</p>

        <p>The social scripting that was immediately obvious in early March tipped me off. Everyone was repeating propaganda and agreed to the shut downs too easily. Any normal discourse was replaced with “out of an abundance of caution”, “it wouldn’t be loving to stay open,” and “it’s about sacrifice for others.” At no point in history has any government taken complete control and then given power back to its citizens without civil war. Nobody would talk about this with me last spring and I was left alone to dissent by myself. I was so horrified by watching everyone fall in line, I forgot to be scared of the virus. When they locked down nursing homes and started denying the elderly contact with their loved ones and nobody protested, it made me feel like I was living in hell. At no point in time have we ever had this response to an illness, contagious or otherwise. If there was any doubt in my mind that the restrictions were not for our health, the doubt was squashed when the governor closed gyms and state parks but allowed liquor stores and fast food restaurants to stay open.</p>

        <p>For me it was the data. Never been one to follow politics or mainstream news, so back in March I was aware of coronavirus but not really paying much attention. When they started to shut shit down I decided to look up the numbers and I just didn’t understand what all the fuss was about. As far as I could tell it didn’t look any worse than the flu. It seemed so obvious I was sure everyone else would see through the bullshit but boy was I wrong 🤦🏼</p>

        <p>I remember one day at work before I knew about any of this that my coworker was going on about it but I brushed it off cause at the time I thought it was pretty ridiculous. Then it was like one morning the news of it was everywhere from China and less than a week after all of a sudden all of the news stations had nothing but reports about it in the US. Soon after that which was also less than a week everyone was recommended to wear masks but even so almost no one did. Then the panic ramped up through the media and we got locked down and masks were made mandatory. Suddenly it was like invasion of the body snatchers and most people just got consumed by fear from all the bullshit and thus started the new religion. I knew it was bullshit the second all the restrictions were put down just because we have never did this for anything else and being outside all the time I never saw any sick people. The goal posts kept being moved back, first it was just 2 weeks but it quickly turned into something with no end in sight. It was also placed right at the door of Spring, it couldn't have been more perfect for creating absolute chaos.</p>

        <p>I have a good rule in life: the more you're not allowed to call something bullshit, the higher the chance that it's bullshit. From day one, you couldn't question anything about this. That immediately set off every bell in my bullshit detector.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t really from the start as I didn’t follow the news at all until late March.  When the media started pushing the scary stories and people crying “ don’t do what I did. I thought I was safe because I’m young “ I realised it was all fearmongering</p>

        <p>for me, the obvious paradoxes were the last hit on the nail.</p>
<p>like, wearing mask in restaurants (except if you eat); staying home (but going to work); 1-meter social distancing (except in public transportation), and such other blatant lies.</p>
<p>what maddens me is, if I try to resist this horseshit then I'll fear for my own freedom, because now everyone is entitled to arrest ya if you don't comply...</p>

        <p>Intuition. The sudden compassion from the government seemed so hypocritical because now is the time they care? After homelessness, and world hunger have never been addressed? Add on dodgy legislation, the ENDLESS media propaganda. It’s so blatant it’s fuckin cringy. And while all of it amped up still didn’t know a single person who had it even extended throughout my entire social circle. </p>
<p>Dumb fucking rules about wearing a mask from the door to your dinner table at a restaurant lol </p>
<p>Oh yeah and the IFR. </p>
<p>Tack on divisive identity politics, BLM, etc. </p>
<p>All I see is divide divide divide, blame your neighbor not those in power, give up your rights it’s for your safety. </p>
<p>It just doesn’t add up. They’re selling something. It’s more than just the virus it’s some serious behind the scenes political NWO shit and their plan is working perfectly.</p>

        <p>I was discussing it with someone before March and when I told them it's "little more than a flu" they basically went off on me that I'm a total idiot. </p>
<p>When things got bad in a few cities I was a bit alarmed, more apt to remember to wash my hands, but generally not changing my life.</p>
<p>When they decided to lockdown for two weeks I said to my mom "this is either a lot worse than they're telling us or they are purposefully scaring us for control/deeper reasons but I can't put my finger on which it is.. but they wouldn't take these steps for the illness we are seeing."</p>
<p>I also said that at the end of the two weeks they'd extend it... When they did is when I realized it was 100% power motivated and became scared for the future.</p>
<p>It's mid-November 2020, I've effectively become a conspiracy theorist prepper.</p>
