    <strong>If lockdowns weren't implemented, wouldn't there have been more deaths? Other than the fact that most people would recover, how is this a good thing for the vulnerable? Please change my mind</strong>
    <p><p>Just a heads up, I'm new to this sub and want to thank all of you for easing my anxiety and changing my mind about covid and lockdowns since I'm moving out in the summer and am looking for jobs again.</p>
<p>Most of us will very likely recover fine (not elderly, no health conditions, etc.) but wouldn't opening everything up be bad news for vulnerable and elderly people since they'd quickly come in contact with someone that had covid? Are we just supposed to see them as a burden to the economy (social security, medical care, etc.) and a good thing if we killed them off?</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Lockdowns are not effective for the majority of people, only helpful for vulnerable and elderly people. If we eased restrictions, wouldn't a ton of them die? How are lockdowns bad for this population?</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you so much for your replies, I was not trying to debate, just trying to see the other side. Thank you so much y'all, I have changed my mind on my stance.</p></p>

        <p>Wouldn't it make sense for the elderly to just stay home rather than the healthy people... Much easier for them to stay home as they are usually retired and more home bound anyway. Before covid, it was typical for old people to go out less during flu season, so why should it be different for covid? Why ruin healthy people's lives by assuming everyone is sick?</p>

        <p>Yeah, and it should also be their choice. If they'd rather accept the risk and see family members and friends anyway, that should be up to them. They should be educated on the risks and then allowed to make their own decisions. That goes for everyone, except maybe children, whose parents should make some of the decisions for them.</p>

        <p>I completely agree with you, and people are still visiting older people for Christmas, New Year's, etc. and accidentally spreading it to them, which proves that lockdowns aren't effective, but it keeps healthy people from catching it and potentially spreading it to vulnerable people I guess. Great points, thank you!</p>

        <p>Do not discount the catastrophic effects lockdowns have on the health of the elderly, not limited to accelerated cognitive decline in people with dementia and likely premature death, missed health screenings and delayed treatment for things like cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke etc.</p>
<p>As far as the general population, you have many of the above plus high rates of death of despair (overdose, suicides etc) not to mention of the financial destruction of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>Also, many metanalyses have been done to demonstrate that lockdowns have done little to nothing to reduce COVID mortality</p>

        <p>Medical stuff aside, a few of my friends have parents in care homes (both in Ohio) and it’s terrible. Think solitary confinement. They can’t visit with each other or even eat together. One of the two I know of just wants to die at this point. It’s so cruel the way these people are treated for the common good yet no one gives a fuck about their interests.</p>

        <p>Those are really great points and I completely agree with you. However, shouldn't schools still be kept closed? Somehow studies show that kids are failing more classes (which I don't understand because Google exists, I've cheated through all of my classes and got straight A's for the first time), but isn't it easier for kids to transmit it since they're asymptomatic but can easily spread it to their parents/grandparents at home without knowing they're positive?</p>

        <p>There is not any evidence to suggest asymptomatic transmission is significant enough to make an identifiable difference in viral spread. Additionally, kids have been shown repeatedly to be virtually immune - they dont get it by large and dont spread it. So, school closures hamstring their education and emotional / social development with no tangible benefit. This is a point that essentially universally agreed upon by all major healthcare orgs (American College of Pediatrics, for example)</p>

        <p>&rt; If lockdowns weren't implemented, wouldn't there have been more deaths? </p>
<p>No. The empirical data is quite clear on that--there are now numerous studies showing that lockdowns had no significant benefit. Here are a couple of recent studies, though there are many more:</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13484">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13484</a></p>

<p>Just because something <em>sounds</em> plausible doesn't mean it's actually true. That is why you have to look at the empirical data. The empirical data does not support the assertion that lockdowns have prevented death.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying that everything should go back to normal immediately whilst the virus is still in circulation. I wouldn't say that 60,000 seat stadiums should be full again just yet for the obvious reasons.</p>
<p>The thing is that shutting down businesses that are staffed by non-vulnerable people and putting healthy people on government support is not sustainable.
It would be possible to provide support for the vulnerable to shelter/shield until they can be vaccinated and made safe and this support could be funded by an economy that is actually functioning - it would cost a fraction of the support so far and could be provided to a level where it would actually be effective.</p>

        <p>There's no evidence from around the States or the world thta lockdowns of any stringency have had any impact on the case count or fatalities.  There is the argument thta without lockdowns, covid would spread among the healthy and young the fastets, and fewer elderly would even be exposed.</p>
<p>The truth though is that by far the strongest predictor of outcome of a population is health. Nothing else. Unless you can stop it very early, and we were months late on thta score, you can't stop if from going around the entire population eventually.</p>

        <p>Howdy. Apologies for reposting this link yet again here, but that question was put to the scientists in this vid https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rz_Z7Gf1aRE and their response was that <em>only</em> the vulnerable should isolate. Sure, not easy for everyone, but surely easier (<em>and</em> more effective) than shutting down entire countries.</p>

        <p>This is only my opinion after speaking with people I know in various areas of the medical field and reading as much as I can stand doing. Even if lockdowns did some of what their supposed to - all we’d be doing is prolonging it. Which I suppose we are to a certain extent. Everyone everywhere will eventually come into contact with covid 19 or whatever strain comes next (like any coronavirus). The best advise is still the original advise, let it run its course and rely on herd immunity while focusing on finding the best therapeutics. Encourage immunity boosting supplements including vitamin D and zinc and wash your hands.</p>

        <p>To a point, I think restrictions are OK, but complete lockdowns carry too much collateral damage for me (decimated businesses, suicides, students not being able to learn properly, elderly people without COVID dying of sheer loneliness while incarcerated in a long-term care home). I was fine when Ontario used colour zones and my area was in the green and then the yellow zone. I found that reasonable. Heck, I found even the 'orange' restrictions reasonable... but at a point, when almost everything is closed and you're almost on house arrest, especially when your area has almost no cases, enough is enough.</p>
