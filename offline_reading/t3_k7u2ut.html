        <p>Is there anyway we can force people to only be at work and have no outside contact other than work? You know , for <em>safety</em></p>
<p>The comment section is full of people demanding homicide charges for the staff. Charge the people taking care of the relatives you put in homes with murder when they have a life outside of care taking for your family. These lower classes need to remember who they serve or go to prison, possibly receive a death sentence for breathing around others!</p>

        <p>That's all part of the Great Reset plan.</p>
<p>Notice how it is leisure and entertainment that has been most heavily persecuted and shut down by WuFlu diktats (bars, restaurants, leisure travel, clubs, theatre, concerts, etc).</p>
<p>There is a reason for that, and it's nothing to do with public health.</p>
<p>In the brave new world, the plebs won't have the time or resources for silly things like leisure time. Any time not spent working or sleeping will be spent alone, in front of a screen, absorbing the propaganda your masters want you to absorb. Kept numb and quiet by shit processed food, alcohol, and cheap recreational drugs.</p>
<p>Drones don't need concerts, social clubs, or vacations to Mexico.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry but you really don’t get it. No industry is persecuted.  The industries you listed are unfortunately hot spots for transmission. Be mad at your incompetent government for screwing small businesses out of the very loans meant to sustain them by allowing publicly traded companies with record profits to eat up the fund. Oh and the churches....tax exempt. They are not businesses right? Wrong. The current administration made sure to get wording into the bill so they too got billions in PPP loans. Disgusting! Don’t believe me? Look it up. </p>
<p>Persecuted by the government is what’s what. This virus isn’t political. The current administration fucked over the American people.</p>

        <p>This is why you keep your work and your personal life completely separate. <em>How in the hell did the employer find out what these people were doing on their own time?</em></p>
<p>- Never discuss your personal life at work.</p>
<p>- Never date a co-worker.</p>
<p>- Never install work apps like MS Teams or Office 365 on your personal devices.</p>
<p>- Never give contact tracing info at an event. Either give false info, or leave.</p>
<p>- Never discuss your personal views on WuFlu or politics with co-workers.</p>
<p>Follow these simple rules, and you will avoid the sort of Spanish Inquisition these wedding attendees are about to go through.</p>

        <p>Couldn't agree more. Employment is an adversarial relationship. They want your labor as cheap as possible, you want as much money as possible. Your employer is not your friend. Every scrap of information they know about you beyond the functions of your job is ammunition to be used against you. Everything you say can and will be used against you to your employer's benefit.</p>

        <p>That’s sad story, but most of those nursing home residents will die within a year anyway based on the science.</p>
<p>“In a study of elderly Americans who moved to a nursing home for their final months or years of life, 65 percent died there within one year, according to an investigation by researchers at the San Francisco VA Medical Center and the University of California, San Francisco.”</p>

        <p>I’m going to be downvoted for sure here, but let me answer your question with an analogy,</p>
<p>You walk across the road, and you are wearing a high vis jacket, and you cross at a proper crossing, yet you still get hit by a car.</p>
<p>It reduces the chance of transmission, not completely stops you from getting it.</p>
<p>A staff’s private life matters, when they are working constantly with high risk people, and then are not only risking their own life, but also the lives of others.</p>

        <p>You can read. Masks protect others more than the individual unless you have been fitted for a real N95 mask.</p>
<p>I wear a mask to protect YOU. I hope others do the same. I derive some degree of protection wearing a mask though the main purpose of wearing one is to prevent my own respiratory droplets from being expelled and infecting people. I wear new masks. I don’t reuse. I cut the loops off and dispose in the trash not on the ground. If I wear a fabric mask I wash it after wearing. I don’t touch my face and I only touch the mask twice- to put it on and take it off. </p>
<p>I had COVID. I didn’t require hospitalization but I was very ill. I developed vascular issues due to this horrible virus. I’ve had two surgeries so far. I’m not overweight, I’m active, no preexisting conditions. </p>
<p>This shit is real. Many people who don’t believe or lack the understanding of the severity of this virus are in for a rude awakening. Wear a mask. Don’t rely on information from limited sources. This is a world wide issue.</p>
