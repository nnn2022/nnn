<title>Record number of healthcare workers laid off! I keep seeing “Not enough ICU beds” and “Hospitals on the brink of collapse”. Maybe it’s because you fired everyone that wasn’t willing to perpetuate your SCAM</title>

        <p>As someone who was pregnant last year, I was at the doctors A LOT. Many people were let go because they didn’t have any elective surgeries or non-essential visits (e.g. annual physicals). Because of this they didn’t need as many nurses and administration workers. The hospitals knew the stimulus plan was pretty good so they gave their employees the option to be laid off.</p>
<p>By the summer, they were rehiring a lot of those laid off employees again.</p>

        <p>Someone I know can't find a job and they're a surgeon. Said a lot of HC workers are being laid off or their contracts aren't being renewed. </p>
<p>No refunds. You work for Satan, you get what you deserve.</p>
