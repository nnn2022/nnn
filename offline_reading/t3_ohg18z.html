    <strong>Who is the enemy?</strong>
    <p><p>I think the regs on this sub are pretty convinced that the COVID hysteria is a bunch of contrived nonsense.  But who are the people pushing it?  Reporters do their job and are always looking for 'clickbait' so I don't blame them.  'scientists' will say whatever their funders want them to say.  I could go on but I want to know who the enemy is so we can put together a call to arms and go after the source of all of the pain the world has been through for the last going on 2 years.  Is it group stupidity or is someone or someones driving this nonsense?  And if we can identify the 'someone' or 'someones' that are driving it for personal profit I, personally, think we should do whatever it takes to remove them from power and hold them accountable for the crimes against humanity they've done.</p></p>

        <p>Ultimately?</p>
<p>College professors in the Humanities departments. They're the driving force behind this cultural revolution.</p>
<p>It isn't all of them, but it's most of them. Go watch Jordan Petersons interview with Yeonmi Park. She escaped north Korea and flat out states that our universities are already more insane. Alternative opinions are actively punished.</p>
<p>Don't send your kids to college, send them to trade school, and for the love of God, fight against this shit further infecting public schools.</p>

        <p>They're brainwashing the people who end up in media, politics, administration of colleges, etc. That's how they spread. It's not a conspiracy so much as the mental equivalent of a viral infection.</p>
<p>Ironically, the number of people signing up for their courses are declining. However the damage has been done, and every single aspect of western culture is under assault by racist historical revisionist Marxists.</p>
<p>Like I said, go watch the Jordan Peterson interview, that and his interview with Rex Murphy.</p>

        <p>FWIW, I don't hold any savings in fiat. You defund the banks, you take away their ability to print money, and you take away their power.</p>
<p>That's is why there is so much FUD surrounding BTC. They are buying it all up behind all their propaganda.</p>

        <p>The first enemy is in the mirror. Have you been the change you seek? Have you done the internal shadow work, addressed your traumas, obtained the knowledge of self and taught others how to do the same? Do you live with morals and principles or do you follow the latest trend of human behavior and imitate what’s seen on their media monarchy? Do you travel the road of truth or do you seek comfortable conformity? </p>
<p>The second enemy are those who have the wisdom and use that occulted knowledge against you in order to have an advantage over you. </p>
<p>There isn’t a “someone” per say. It’s a hive mind mentality. All about power and control. If you engage in those mindsets you are helping manifest a world of slavery. If you engage people with truth and love you are manifesting something greater than this master/slave system we’ve been under for so long. </p>
<p>“It’s a big club and you ain’t in it”.
It isn’t a small group of people. They control the majority of information the hits the masses, thus forming mass perceptions. Mind control. If you don’t have control over your mind, someone else will.</p>

        <p><em>Who?</em>  - the most important question in problem solving. Unfortunately, the tard-right has spent the last decade obscuring this vital question. Trump, DeSantis, Jordan Peterson, Mencius Moldbug, Brett Weinstein and every other right-wing influencer has been working hard so that you won't figure it out.</p>
<p>It's not too complicated tho. Which was the first country to impose vaccine passports? Which country has blackmail on all the important officials and scientists? Which country has a deranged aspiration to "rule the world with an iron rod"?</p>

        <p>&rt; Reporters do their job and are always looking for 'clickbait' so I don't blame them.</p>
<p>Wow, you are letting off the people who allowed this propaganda to spread around the world.</p>
<p>Journalists are fucking idiots. Think about the last time you met a journalists with some integrity, or that knew what the fuck they were talking about. These people will type and publish whatever their bosses tell them to. They are idiots of the highest order, offering up their opinions as facts, "fact checking" then they don't have a clue what they are talking about, and of course most of all doing absolutely no fucking actual journalism.</p>
<p>&rt; 'scientists' will say whatever their funders want them to say.</p>
<p>Again, you fob this off as just doing their job.</p>
<p>The nazis were just doing their job too.</p>
<p>The top of the pyramid are the banksters who make money from these crises. They have been doing this shit for centuries. </p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTPopNG6LRM">The Money Masters</a> for some insight into how these people operate. </p>
<p>They don't care about anyone but themselves and their own. Money and control is the goal.</p>

        <p>you are correct.  That said the man who signs the paychecks for all of these people is the one that controls what they say.  At the end of the day 'scientists' and 'reporters' are just pawns in a bigger game.</p>
