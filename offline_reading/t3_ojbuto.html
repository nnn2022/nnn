    <strong>The TV did its job. French people will do what they're told.</strong>
    <p><p>The plan has worked flowlessly. We could see it coming for the past months but the truth doesn't hurt any less. 
Months and months of end-of-the-world media coverage. It's so obvious yet people get used to the narrative being pushed further and further, every few weeks. It's always the same strategy :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Why do conspiracy theorists think there'll be a covid passport ?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Should there be a vaccine passport ?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"These politicians plead for a vaccine passport."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point they know what people think about it. If they're ripe, they continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"The government is thinking of implementing a vaccine passport for some professions"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The governement introduces a mandatory vaccine for these professions, and covid passport for buying groceries and taking the train. PCR tests are no longer free" (we're here)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"In face of the new variant 'Gamma" we must enforce vaccinations on all citizen older than 5."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Etc...
I'm really tired and disgusted with the servility of my people. My job will basically mean I must get vaccinated to visit clients, even though I'm too young for any of this to make sense. Four people died of covid this past sunday. Four. I don't know what to do, and I'm just broke enough and inexperienced enough that leaving and getting a job somewhere sane isn't really doable.</p></p>

        <p>Most have slowly bought into this, through propaganda first, then fear and peer pressure. I suspect we have reached a critical mass of obedient  individuals for anything to change at this point.</p>

        <p>Because, like everyone on this planet, they are conditioned by their establishment to conform to it's whims in spite of their own desires. People learn about conditioning in school without understanding that it has happened to them and everyone else to some extent. The purpose of t.v. is to indoctrinate and intellectually subdue you through entertainment.</p>
