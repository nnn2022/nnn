<p>Used to live in New Orleans until recently. Had to move because of all of this Covid bullshit. I was actually banned from their subreddit a few weeks ago for posting "Covid Misinformation." Yep.</p>
<p>Quite frankly that entire subreddit is cancer. It's really sad. Love that city. The redditors on that board... not so much.</p>

        <p>The mayor cancelling and banning everything ruined my business as I relied entirely on tourists. Then the crime got worse and worse. Last day I was there was when that pedi cab passenger did a drive by on a cop. Just fucked right off after that.</p>

        <p>Oh no I am so sorry. I heard about that incident. I don’t blame you, that probably would’ve been the nail in the coffin for me too. I’ve heard about the crime getting awful. Aren’t carjackings up like 150% or something? I heard a woman was robbed in broad daylight by Toast near the track too... my old stomping grounds. And then the shooting that just happened the other day. All involving kids. It’s usually kids unfortunately. They need to be in school in New Orleans, and the school systems fail them too. Ugh. The whole thing is awful. Really love that city but it definitely has a very dark side to it. I knew the crime was just going to get worse during the year. All those people without jobs and kids not in school? Bound to happen unfortunately. Hope you’re doing okay and in a safe area now.</p>

        <p>I liked toast too. In a safe small town now but is unfortunately locked the fuck down hard. They did another two weeks lockdown about three months ago that is still going. Came here to be close to one of the people I produced stuff for and ended up trapping myself in one of the most locked down places in the country I think. Almost no push back too I go out and put up flyers and they are all torn down within a few hours.</p>

        <p>Ugh that’s so unfortunate. I’m currently back in NYC which is completely closed and it sucks. Nothing to do, just got really cold, and nothing to look forward to. I am so sad about what life used to be. It just amazes me that more people aren’t. I alternate between being severely depressed, extremely pissed off, and just apathetic to everything (Defense mechanism at this point I think). Last night I was job hunting online and couldn’t get over the fact that we’ll have to wear masks in a public setting for a long time to come. Really freaking upsetting. I don’t even know what to do at this point. I wish more people felt the way we do. This sub has really saved my life, it’s helped get me through these awful times. Helps to know there are people that feel the way that we do. We’re not crazy. It’s perfectly natural to have this reaction to something that is completely unnatural, i.e: masks, lockdowns, etc... Honestly it’s insane to me that more people don’t have these reactions. NYC is never going to be the same again. New Orleans is never going to be the same again. Cities are done. How can they come back from this? It’ll take years, at least. But I’m so mad that we gave up a year of our lives for nothing that I’ll never feel the same again and I’ll never ever forget.</p>

        <p>The willingness of people to be ruled is startling. And the severe lack of factions surprises as well.</p>
<p>I drank with gutterpunks and druggies. Whores and artists. Anarchists and punks. All of them towing the line.</p>
<p>Was talking to a girl from back there the other night who was a prostitute and would tell me stories about doing acid and cocaine on the riverfront until five in the morning. Give me speeches about hating cops and authority. Talk about worshipping death and colllapse.</p>

        <p>I know it’s crazy! The most social, anti-authority people are afraid of a virus no more dangerous than the flu and are listening to and trusting the government. Blows my mind.</p>
<p>I remember last March when this was all starting and my friend in upstate NY was saying they were going to shut down and I told her, “Yeah, that’ll never happen in New Orleans. It’s the most social city in America.” I really didn’t think it would happen or people would listen. Boy, was I sadly wrong... </p>

        <p>Last time I was on the New Orleans reddit was when the mayor was putting forth the 500 dollar mask fines. I asked how people were expected to pay that when they aren’t even allowed to work and just just told me “just wear a mask and it’s not an issue”. Then was told not being allowed to work or go to church or visit sick family or wear what you want isn’t oppression. Then I was shadow banned.</p>

Exposing yourself to something that makes you angry without real motivation or ability to change the circumstance is just self abuse.

        <p>Yeah I hear you. My New Year’s resolution was actually to get off Reddit completely and I’m doing a great job with that so far... it’s coming soon though. This is the only social media I have and the censorship is getting ridiculous. Especially after all of this with the free trading and Game Stop, I think Reddit is gonna get really bad. They already ban people for free thinking. I don’t feel confident about the future right now. I wish there was more activism here too. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I wish we all just stopped wearing masks. If every person did this collectively, this would be all over already.</p>
