    <strong>Data/studies that show how vaccines prevent symptoms yet are unable to prevent infection?</strong>
    <p><p>We’ve known since the get go that the vaccines were not capable of stopping infection, and are meant to prevent severe symptoms. I’ve been over and over this in my head, and with Fauci and the cdc directors latest comments around “the viral load is the same in vaccinated people as is in unvaccinated people”, I’m finding it impossible for that to be true while at the same time the vaccine is doing anything to prevent symptoms. I can’t find anything about HOW the vaccines do this, just article after article claiming that’s what they do. Anyone have anything?</p></p>
