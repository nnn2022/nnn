    <strong>"No shirt, no shoes, no service"</strong>
    <p><p>Any company has the right to refuse service to you for \^ those reasons and it is rarely questioned, if at all, in today's world, how is a company policy for wearing a mask any different? Not here to threaten your beliefs, just wanting to understand the other side.</p></p>

        <p>A privately owned store can enforce masks as harshly as they want, I just won’t shop there. If I go somewhere without a mask and an employee asks me to put one on, I leave. There are a few shops in my area that don’t require masks, and I shop there as much as I can.</p>
<p>The problem we have is with the government forcing businesses to require masks under the threat of fines or closure. This makes mask wearing a “new normal” until the government says otherwise. That’s a slippery slope that leads towards authoritarianism like we see in Melbourne now.</p>
<p>Also, we doubt that cloth masks actually work. In the spring scientists were saying that masks are not effective. But let’s assume for a second that they do work. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html">In June the WHO said that asymptomatic spread is rare.</a> This means that there is no point in wearing masks as a healthy person, because healthy people do not spread the virus. Forcing every person to cover their face in public when they are not sick is all about control, not safety.</p>

        <p>Let’s not forget the single use masks being a waste of resources and the reusable ones? Where are people storing them when not in use? Unless it’s in a sterile spot the mask will collect all the stuff you don’t want on to. Plus the constant touching and readjusting.  </p>
<p>Plus they really only work 100% if you are in a controlled environment.  Hence why they work so well in hospitals but at your local Walmart? No so much.</p>

        <p>Oops, did I stumble into an anti-masker thread? At least I'm glad you can agree that businesses are free to enforce masks as a dress code. The government enforcing masks is a step down that slope, and its slipperiness is why "No shirt, no shoes, no service" is not governmentally enforced. Well, usually for women shirts are required, and for everyone pants are required. It's a question of requiring someone to do something to protect someone else. In this case, it seems masks are more important than pants.</p>
<p>&rt;But let’s assume for a second that they do work. </p>
<p>Thanks again for your agreement.</p>
<p>&rt;In June the WHO said that asymptomatic spread is rare.</p>
<p>No, they didn't. It's unfortunate that is still the headline and a 'key point' even though CNBC posted an update underneath a video that is just the 'key points' again.</p>
<p>&rt;Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said “I was responding to a question at the press conference. I wasn’t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that. I was just trying to articulate what we know...And in that, I used the phrase ‘very rare,’ and I think that that’s misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. I was referring to a small subset of studies.”</p>
<p>I get that her personal statement could have been construed as official at the time, but WHO has gone to great lengths to be sure that was never their position, and that  Dr. Kerkhove has clarified that "asymptomatic spread is rare" is not what she meant.</p>
<p>Where was the outcry when Opa-locka instituted a dress code banning exposed underwear? It's currently <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/09/13/saggy-pants-ban-could-soon-be-dropped-in-opa-locka/">proposed to be repealed</a> by the council.</p>

        <p>Businesses don’t have a choice at the moment. </p>
<p>If a business wants to ban for for not wearing a mask that’s understandable and entirely their decision to make, I just won’t shop there as long as there are alternatives</p>

        <p>Yea, and those that don't enforce mask policies get attacked by people.</p>
<p>How do you think Vancouver got mandatory mask policy in transit? Because one woman decided to campaign for it.</p>
<p>Various places around the world are campaigning for mandatory masking in public. So it can be applied to everywhere.</p>

        <p>I get their perspective, and with privately owned businesses I respect their decision. If they ask me to leave for not wearing a mask then I do, no questions asked.</p>
<p>The government forcing those businesses to have those rules is a problem though.</p>
