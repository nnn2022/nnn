        <p>People need to start getting violent, as much as I hate to say it... Peaceful protest do not work. The police are violent towards the people and people need to resist and fight back to show these governments we will not tolerate this crap. Until then, we are fucked.</p>
<p>there are more of us than them, we rise up fighting they will be scared.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>that lady said they are testing university students weekly? What total BS, I’d refuse that and tell them to fuck off.</p>

        <p>I’d actually love to hear from a police officer on this. I imagine their patience is wearing thin. Some of them will have spent long and illustrious careers and risked their lives taking on dangerous criminals. Now their being asked to devote their time and manpower to responding to 999 calls citing the neighbours inviting seven people to a barbecue!</p>
<p>But it’s ok, say the government. We’ll get you some help via Covid marshals, jumped up bell ends who used to work as security guards in TK Maxx before they got the sack for slapping a 15-year-old girl on the arse and who are dying for their next power trip, then we’ll give them a fraction of the amount of training then let them loose. I’m sure they’ll be a real asset to the force!</p>
<p>I can’t agree with you on this. I think we want to get the police onside and that comes from behaving ourselves when we protest. If we don’t then the media will be on it like a fly on shit. If the threat of police action against Covid regulations is gone, people will stop caring and things will start to return to normal. That’s how the fall of the Berlin Wall came about - collective apathy. Never forget that they’re human beings with houses to pay for and families to feed. They  are paid to enforce the law, unjust though it is, although I’m sure lots of them will be wondering why they’re bothering as soon as they get off duty, be complaining about it to each other and raising these gripes in meetings at the station. I very much doubt any of them expected to find themselves in this position seven months after the fact either and they’ve got to be questioning why they’re even bothering. </p>
<p>I’m obviously putting words in people’s mouths here, which is why I’d be really interested to hear from a copper if there are any reading this.</p>

        <p>2:50 The mask is falling off the police man's face and he has to touch the mask, his face and other people all the time. Clearly they're not flawless.</p>
