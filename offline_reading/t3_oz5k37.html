    <strong>This is so hard</strong>
    <p><p>I dont know if this is the right place to say this but i dont know what else to do. Life is so hard right now i cry every night because im poor seeing how bullshit this all is. 
Jeff bezos $193.8 billion</p>
<p>Elon musk $184.7 billion</p>
<p>Bill gates  $ 131.6 billion</p>
<p>Nba players signing contracts for $200 million</p>
<p>Am i the only one who thinks this is sick and disgusting. If all these people shared there money we could all be rich world hunger would be wiped out we could all live better lives. Instead we have to suffer These people are terrible. I understand people are going to they worked hard to get where they are i understand that but those people sold their soul to the devil and im never going to do that because thats the only way people are going to be successful.</p></p>

<p>You need to educate yourself in economics. </p>
<p>We have, as a society, granted to you for a modest fee access to more information and learning potential than an entire college staff in the 1800s would have. (The internet)</p>
<p>We have, as a society, granted to you for a modest fee access to more types of foods, spices, and drinks than the kings of europe would have at nearly any point in history.</p>
<p>We have, as a society, granted to you for a modest fee access to the most various entertainments; books, movies, shows, games, sports, and a thousand other leisure activities. </p>
<p>All you must do is be patient, work somewhat hard, and keep your excesses in check. If you spend less money than you make, you will never be destitute. Do not squander the future for the now. And the only time you should be looking at what someone else has is either to draw inspiration, or to make sure they have enough. </p>
<p>Those who are rich did not "sell their soul". They made good choices, took large risks, and happened to be at the right place at the right time. Many of them disrupted whole markets, or forged new ones. They helped to make access to the goods and services we want easier or more affordable. Good for them. </p>
<p>Amazond did not steal money from you or their workers. They stole customers from Walmart, Kmart, Shopko, Radioshack, Blockbuster, and hundreds of other corporations. They did so by offering a better service that people choose. </p>
<p>Your life is likely far better than the majority of human life throughout history, largely because of people like them; people who disrupt the system abd bring more access to more things to more people, for a modest fee.</p>
