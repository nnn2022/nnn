    <strong>Why is it that some nurses and doctors are acting like war hero's through this thing and some are just saying it's regular flu season?</strong>
    <p><p>I have a friend of facebook who's a nurse and she's always posting about her experience with this pandemic and how horrible it is and we need to continue to stay away from our families and wear mask for her sake (not exactly how she words it but the jist of what she's saying) 
But then I hear from other nurses who don't post online about this stuff and they just say it's hyped up media panic and just regular flu season. All the nurses I've heard from are in suppose hot spot areas.</p></p>

        <p>They hired a bunch of travel nurses at my hospital during the spike. After the spike (around oct-sep) they started letting a lot of staff go (fired them) and then loaded all the nurses with a higher patient ratio. </p>
<p>Nurses started out capped at 2 covid+ patients max. Then they fired a bunch of nurses so slowly but surely you saw nurses starting to have 5 to 6 positive covid patients. </p>
<p>So basically they are absolutely fucking all the nurses. What are they gonna do quit? They have families to feed. And the management knows this. </p>
<p>Here’s the sick joke though-</p>
<p>You’ll see many hospitals stating they are at “capacity”</p>
<p>This does not mean the hospitals are full it means the NURSES are at max capacity because they fired half of them. </p>
<p>It’s word play.</p>

        <p>The hospital was never “full” the staff was cut in half so the staff was at “capacity. </p>
<p>I was exposed to positive patients 3 days a week from March to November (I quit). I had covid, felt like a shity cold but I recovered in a week or two. </p>
<p>I believe covid is a real virus clearly. But it’s being weaponized. I won’t go back to healthcare.</p>

        <p>This is very true.  A couple of things to remember though.</p>
<p>1)  A shortage of ICU beds is not a shortage of actual beds or rooms.  It is almost universally a shortage of staff.  Usually nursing but it can be MDs or support staff as well. </p>
<p>2) Nurses are not plug replaceable units.  An OB/Gyn nurse can not just step in for an ICU nurse.  So while nurses are laid off that is usually because "elective" procedures have been canceled so there's no load on those floors.  It doesn't mean they could just go up and work COVID ward.</p>

        <p>did you see that video going around like 2 weeks ago from Edmonton, AB? A bunch of doctors got together and essentially wrote an open letter to the city. Basically they were like yes, emergency rooms are full and yes, we are totally understaffed but it is ALWAYS like this. </p>
<p>At least the nurses still have time to film their Tik Toks!</p>

        <p>Attention seeking. A friend of mine is doing the same. So terrified of this virus she decided to get a job working in care. While telling me she is too scared to go to the store incase she takes the virus back home to her mother who she lives with.</p>
<p>She quit her original job to do this one. At a time she is fearful of a so called deadly virus thats doing its rounds. </p>
<p>I am convinced she got the job because she wanted the attention. She is a poster girl of virtue signal. She bought NHS merch to photograph herself to share on social media, with the "stay home. Save lifes" slogan branded across the images. Clapped every week and then would tell the world it makes her cry every week as it is so emotional knowing how heroic the front line workers are. </p>
<p>She is constantly trying to get praise from me over messages. 4 times today she has told me she is working Christmas day. Ive responded to the other parts of what she has said but I cant entertain the attention seeking. 
She even went as far as telling me that she chose to work Christmas and then told me her hours, which I didnt ask about. Nor did I respond to those with anything other than a thumbs up. Shes really irritating me now and so it has resulted in this little rant.</p>

        <p>DAE find it a little strange that hospitals became the "frontlines"? 
I'm not a pacifist but the obsession with military analogies is obnoxious.</p>
<p>While a hospital isn't somewhere that is pleasant to spend time, regardless of corona, it's exactly what they signed up for.  It's kind of like the people who enlist in the military during peacetime and then try to get out after a war starts.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with the nurses (in addition to the hard working conditions obviously) is that after we went from "we're all in this together stage" to "this would have been over if it wasn't for the people who do x,y,z".
It's a lot easier for people to come to grips with something that is beyond the control of even their most trusted health official.</p>
<p>This is similar logic to why people believe in conspiracy theories.  It's scary to think the world is chaotic and shit can kick off unexpectedly so it's fun for people to think that the world is mostly in order if it wasn't for the evil cabal causing bad things to happen.</p>

        <p>I think they don’t understand that not every covid patient goes straight to the hospital like it seems. When majority of people get covid, they stay home, and guess what, the cases at the hospital are the worst of the worst. If they aren’t then why is their lazy ass there.</p>

        <p>A healthcare worker’s reaction to the pandemic is really just an extension of their self-righteousness and disposition to authoritarianism. It largely follows political siding: Right leaning are more pro-freedom and left leaning are more pro-lockdown/mask mandate. </p>
<p>I’m a frontline worker and, while I recognize the potential harm for vulnerable populations, I have been pro-freedom from the beginning, with the onus of responsibility being put on the vulnerable to alter THEIR lives, not healthy people altering theirs.</p>

        <p>Each and every one of <strong>US</strong> that already has or might eventually become infected with the virus are the FRONT LINE!</p>

<p>Each of us needs to do OUR job for OUR immune system to win each individual battle, and not go crazy/become dysregulated and cause friendly fire casualties.</p>
<p>Medical professionals are a SECONDARY line of defense, and 1.7M deaths (rightly or wrongly) attributed to this virus says that many frontline fighters (being us, the people) and the second line defense (being medical professionals) are doing a very bad job, and are failing to use the intel that humanity has gathered over thousands of years on how to win "wars" such as this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, trillion dollar corporations are posed to grub up $20 to $40 for almost every man, woman, and child on the planet for something that there is no scientific evidence for a need of (because known controllable intrinsic normal factors have never been controlled for in <em>any</em> study, as is required by the scientific method).</p>
<p>To add: each of US that won OUR battles with this virus are the actual "war hero's".  I'm NOT party to the attributed deaths of ~1.7M people, and if I were, I sure as hell wouldn't be bragging about it!</p>

        <p>Doctors and nurses are people. Some of them are delusional and susceptible to flattery and brainwashing just like the rest of the population. Plenty of medical professionals have personality disorders and mental illness. Society put them on a pedestal and some of them decided to stay up there and some realized it was nonsense and carried on. Working in health care has always been rough. Emotionally stable people know that and don't expect special praise.</p>

        <p>I met a doctor on twitter recently in a thread about a woman saying “do you really need to go out every weekend during a pandemic?” and this guy replied “Yeah, i work five days a week, and i will enjoy the other 2 days” and he was criticized a lot. </p>
<p>I commented that these guys virtue signaling and saying to stay home etc, are the ones going out more and we shouldn’t care for what they say. We shouldn’t stop living and seeing people for a disease with such a mortality rate. </p>
<p>And he worked with covid patients but wasn’t giving a shit about the pandemic and living his life normally. If these doctors know what’s up, why should we be scared?</p>

        <p>Medical personnel think they are God-like. (A lot of them). Many of them are in the profession for their egos and the money. They like the power, and this is a big power trip for them. They like feeling in control and that people desperately need them. The ones like I have described are totally ready to wear the " hero" badge and tell tales of how important and essential they (but no one else) are.</p>

        <p>Ego is a major part of it.  Also location.  I have a friend who manages the ER down in an area where the Native population (poverty, high diabetes, heart disease etc) got hit HARD. It sounded like it was hell for a few weeks-now that they've reached herd immunity in that area, they have less people in their ER than ever because everyone's scared of the virus so they don't come for minor things.  He doesn't have a big ego though and isn't a narcissist, so when we chatted it was more about care, what they were doing for treatment, etc, no bragging, no virtue signaling.  We don't wear masks when we visit him or his family, they're very casual and grounded in reality.  They wash their clothes and shower after work. Obviously we're not going to visit if they're sick, just like in normal times.</p>

        <p>Because they're the only ones who get any airtime.</p>
<p>The nurses who act like they just spent all day storming Normandy Beach are the ones who get upvoted to the top of every mainstream subreddit, go viral on twitter, get interview spots on the news, etc</p>
<p>I'd imagine most healthcare workers who are just doing their damn jobs without all the histrionics simply aren't interested in being jerked off by the entire social mediasphere.  They just want to go home and have a beer and get some sleep and be left the fuck alone until they go back to work the next morning.</p>
<p>At worst, those who speak out against the narrative are silenced, buried, mocked/derided, and in extreme cases may even be fired from their jobs.  The same platforms that prop up the drama queens are also scrubbing any and all dissenting information - factual <em>or</em> editorial.</p>
<p>P.S. I have had long work days/work weeks before.  When I come home from a 15 hour work day + hour commute, I do not have goddamn <em>time</em>, let alone energy, to waste arguing with people on social media or circlejerking with Don Lameon on Clown News Network.  Most of the time when I have a day like that, I don't even take my computer out of my backpack when I get home, and even text messages go unanswered until the next morning.  If you have time for that shit, you can't be <em>too</em> exhausted.</p>

        <p>Very simple. Some people Like the attention. They enjoy feeling Like they are on the "Front line" and that they are saving the World, it gives them the sense of accomplishment and meaningfullness that every human desires. They don't get that from their Job regularly, because Nobody Sees them doing their Job.</p>
<p>It makes complete sense when you Look at what type of nurses always Post instagram/snapchat stories when they are at work "saving lives today xoxo!!", and what type of nurses don't. They Like the feeling of being on the "right side" and fighting for what's "good".</p>
<p>I have noticed exactly the same Thing. Those who work in a medial field for appreciation and almost feel arrogant when speaking about what their Job is, Are those who Play the Pandemic out worse than it is.</p>
<p>And those normal rational doctors who just became doctors because they actually want to help people, because they are actually interested in how the body works, are the ones who quickly realize that something is not quite adding up, just by thinking logically and making use of the knowledge they acquired over time.
Those "instagram nurses" just Do it so they can get these "oh my gawd thank you for being a hero during these Times!!"-messages from their friends on social Media. Pretty obvious who is who.</p>
