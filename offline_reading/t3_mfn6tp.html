    <strong>ThE vAcCiNe Is WoRkInG! "SARS-CoV-2 Infection after Vaccination in Health Care Workers in California" (NEJM)</strong>
    <p><p>LINK:  <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc2101927?articleTools=true">SARS-CoV-2 Infection after Vaccination in Health Care Workers in California (nejm.org)</a> </p>
<p>&rt;Data from phase 3 clinical trials of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines through November 2020 showed 94.1% efficacy for the prevention of symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection at 14 days after the second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna)<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2101927#"><strong>1</strong></a> and 95% efficacy at 7 days after the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer).<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2101927#"><strong>2</strong></a> Since the results of these trials were published, a nationwide surge in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been noted, SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased infectivity have emerged, the Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization for these two mRNA vaccines, and vaccination has been initiated across the United States.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Since the start of the vaccination campaign, the development of Covid-19 has been reported in persons who have received one or both doses of vaccine.<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2101927#"><strong>3</strong></a> Both the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) health systems began to vaccinate health care workers on December 16, 2020. On December 2, in addition to defining a low threshold for testing of symptomatic persons, UCSD mandated that asymptomatic health care workers undergo weekly testing by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay of nasal swabs. On December 26, UCLA instituted an optional testing program for asymptomatic health care workers with PCR assay of nasal swabs. This program has allowed for increased detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections after vaccination.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is there any mention of the cycle thresholds at which the PCR tests were used to determine a positive case during the period in question? <strong><em>NOPE!</em></strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the WHO change its PCR test cycle threshold guidance in Jan 2021 during the period of the study, which would have affected the results of the same study? <strong><em>YES!</em></strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was this alluded to in the slightest way? <strong><em>NOPE!</em></strong></p>

        <p>I absolutely agree! It's just that the last 15 months have seen the complete collapse of the dyke. The reason that I have been extremely anti-vax, anti-pharmaceuticals, anti-global warming and anti-agrochemicals is because I did my own independent research and found out that ScIeNtIfIc CoNsEnSuS can be bought.</p>

<p>Yes- mostly via "government-funded studies".  Generally there's a specific outcome that's desired and the funding would be contingent on the specified conclusion being reached- a problem for which there's likely already a solution.</p>

        <p>It does say it prevents 94% of symptomatic cases. For all we know it prevents 0% of asymptomatic cases. Just suppression of severe symptoms, but those who'd die from covid without the vaccine will still die from it. For all we know the vaccine gives people covid but with no side effects other than dying.</p>
<p>Sorry if by suggesting a non popular scientific hypothesis I get this sub banned guys, I know it's against modern "scientific" dogma to deviate from government approved scripts, but sometimes you have to risk the digital excommunicates and stake burning and just ask "what if the sun is the center of our star system?"...</p>

        <p>Omg, that is one of the krappiest pieces of "research" I've ever seen. No wonder they published it as a "letter" and not as peer-reviewed research.</p>
<p>So 2 weeks out from the respective experimental biological agents being injected into these people's arms, without reference to whether the subjects faced an actual challenge with the theoretical virus, they are using negative PCR tests (at 2 weeks) to CONCLUDE that these things affect whether people catch c0oTiEs? At two weeks?</p>
<p>Here's what that so-called study says and implies: I rubbed mud in my cousin's papercut. 2 weeks later he had not yet caught cOoTiEs when I ran a 5 cycle PCR test. Therefore everyone on this planet must rub mud in their papercuts and pay me a few billion dollars for it and let me take their rights and freedoms and track their every move forever. Cause I have the magic bullet against cOoTiEs!</p>

        <p>We're in the middle of a GlObAl PaNdEmIc and we can use Himalayan salt to virtue signal to those who burn sage and believe in energy healing that we're doing the best we can to purify the air with our salt. </p>

        <p>I wish agitprop like this wasn't out there too!</p>
<p>Notwithstanding how obnoxious virtue-signalling is, I'm of the belief that we are fundamentally energy (as physics suggests), and should keep an open mind about energy healing despite the fact that we may not have developed measurement apparatuses for that at this stage in history. </p>
<p>At the same time (as I believe my comments have indicated), I also believe it is important to maintain logic and rigor in our mechanistic scientific explorations. Money seems to have distorted science beyond all recognition in many cases, with horrifying consequences.</p>

        <p>Glad you get it that we humans can't measure everything yet :) It does seem that way sometimes, but I also see lots of people trying to do good things in the world for free.</p>

        <p>“The rarity of positive test results 14 days after administration of the second dose of vaccine is encouraging and suggests that the efficacy of these vaccines is maintained outside the trial setting. These data underscore the critical importance of continued public health mitigation measures (mask- ing, physical distancing, daily symptom screening, and regular testing), even in environments with a high incidence of vaccination, until herd immu- nity is reached at large.”</p>
