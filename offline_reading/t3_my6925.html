    <strong>Have any of you ever experienced having a doctor pressure / coerce you into a medical treatment (vaccine, surgery, drug, etc) that you didn‚Äôt want to have?</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like this question is particularly relevant right now, when people wordwide are being coerced into getting jabs that they may not want. It seems so common for the medical establishment to bully and pressure or coerce people into treatments. That‚Äôs what happened with me when I had Gardasil, and also some meds I was forced to take as a kid. </p>
<p>How else will they get everyone vaccinated and ready for the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù? It‚Äôs almost as if the entire medical establishment was practicing their coercion tactics for this moment in time üòÖüò≠</p></p>

        <p>Yes.  Had a doctor push a copper IUD on me, which I was hesitant about because I had read there was nickel in them, which gives me a horrible skin rash.  I agreed to do an allergy test where a piece of the wire was taped to my skin.  I broke out in a rash, and she basically said it was NBD.  I fired her and filed a complaint with the clinic manager.</p>

        <p>I was scheduled to have my tubes tied. Dr was well aware I was allergic to metals. Called 2 days before scheduled procedure, found out it involved <em>metal clamps</em>. Dr and staff swore it would be NBD. They finally had me tape a nickel to my arm overnight. It took me WEEKS to get rid of that horribly itchy rash. :| Later found out a friend had the same procedure done (with her metal allergies). After 11 months of debilitating pain and ‚Äúunexplained menstrual and other severe issues‚Äù she had a full hysterectomy and was completely healthy after that. They blamed her ‚Äúfaulty uterus‚Äù.</p>

        <p>That's such shit.  I had gone in to get my tubes tied and the doctor did everything to get out of it besides refer me to someone else.  She would have rather I put something in my body that I have a known allergy to than just accept that I don't want crotch fruit.  Fortunately the next provider listened to me and understood my reasoning.</p>

        <p>Every time I have been to the dentist for the past 30 years, I have been informed that my wisdom teeth absolutely must come out. It has not been explained to me why this is the case, simply that it is, in fact, the case.</p>

        <p>I used to work for a dentist office they would always tell people to get braces (when they didn't need it) or tell people to remove their wisdom tooth(their rationale is it's hard to clean back there and risk of plaque and cavities).</p>

        <p>Doctors are the definition of group think and conformism. </p>
<p>After 12 years of progressive education, how could they not be?</p>
<p>Icing on the cake when you realize their text books and medicine programs are funded from J&amp;J, Pfizer and Moderna.</p>
<p>They are taught to prescribe pills. Each pill has a side effect that Pfizer, J&amp;J and Moderna have a cure for. Which is of course another pill with another side effect.</p>
<p>Most doctors or egotistical morons who should be taken with skepticism at best.</p>

        <p>Wisdom teeth can give you lots of problems, jaw, TMJ, back problems, infections etc... The lower ones are connected to a hell of a lot of nerves that are connected to many points in the face, skull and neck. Wisdom teeth usually grow out a bit crooked and prone to infection/nerve infection. </p>
<p>Theyre not "superfluous teeth", they were very needed in the neolithic era and many years ago when people were hunting animals and needed strong teeth. Now we eat soup and white bread... And those teeth are coming up crooked, weak and superfluous. </p>
<p>I heard the same thing, wisdom teeth must be removed, but I was thoroughly explained why.</p>
<p>Anyway, some docs do repeat whatever their superior tells them to repeat and apply, some of them ask no questions, they just do it, theyre human after all. But I totally see your point OP. He should have explained you why.</p>

        <p>In fairness they can cause a ton of problems. My dentist never pushed, we left my bottoms in when I had braces, pulled the tops as one had grown in strange where it had folded and was trapping all kinds of nonsense, so it became incredibly painful. I pulled one of my bottoms because it died and I kept getting infections.</p>

        <p>Yes, due to medical problems, doctors have even wanted to experiment on me. I have said no. I am turning down one or two medicine due to side effects. They don't like it. I do not trust the medical world and almost have died before from misdiagnosis.

        <p>Thanks. There are a lot of arrogant doctors. Sometimes I was far happier under the care of PAs, but that only happened once in awhile when I got assigned a PA instead.</p>

        <p>Like 10 years ago a doctor coerced my grandma into getting chemo "just in case", after she had a double mastectomy and felt better than she had in years. Immediately after treatment she was hospitalized and barely able to even speak. She died a few weeks later. Fuck doctors, fuck the healthcare system. Take health in your own hands by prolonged fasting and eating healthy among other things. Wish I knew this stuff back then I could've saved her life.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm sorry about your grandmaüå∑My lovely grandpa was coerced into chemo too. They found stage IV throat cancer with metastasis in lungs and liver (basically something impossible to reverse/cure). He was still living his normal life by then. My family was medically ‚Äúignorant‚Äù about cancer so of course followed the oncologist recommendation thinking that maybe would prolong his life. 4 chemo sessions later, he was gone (and what a horrible way to leave, suffering, vomiting, using morphine for pain, loosing weight like a skeleton, mouth ulcers... well you probably know the effects of chemo). They gave him an unnecessary painful and quicker death. I later found out through a friend that works in a pharma company that both docs and the hospital get paid a lot for each chemo prescribed to patients (she could give me specific numbers). This is when my spiritual journey began and when I could see with my own eyes how pharma industry is not there to save your life and promote your wellbeing, but to create lifelong clients (drug addicts) and make money even in cases where you definitely wouldn‚Äôt advise to have a treatment.</p>

        <p>Yeah they tried to convince my mom that I should get gardasil when I was literally like 11/12. My mom was like ‚Äúmy daughter doesn‚Äôt even like boys yet...‚Äù I never got it. And find it disturbing that a female doctor would think a child should get an std shot. Wtf? Never got flu shots either. The only shots I ever had were the basic childhood ones- chickenpox (which didn‚Äôt work since I still caught it in high school), rubella, measles, etc.
And on the dentist front- I‚Äôve been pressured to get braces my entire life but refused. Everyone else I asked said my teeth did not look crooked at all.</p>

        <p>When I was doing onboarding for my first hospital job the occupational health physician was trying to talk me into taking Isoniazid as I tested positive for the TB skin test despite my chest x-ray was negative for TB. I declined because my chances of contracting active TB is low, I'd have to be on this medication for 6-9 months and adhere to a diet, I didn't like the side effects of the drug Isoniazid and it doesn't eliminate the chances of contracting TB in the future.

        <p>I used to trust doctors 100% until 10 years ago I had a bad experience with taking a medication called Retin-A as I had really bad eczema and a condition called keratosis pilaris to my stomach area. The damn medication nearly burnt off my skin. It was so painful it was even hard for me to breathe or move. I looked like I had 2nd degree burns to my stomach. They had to put me on prednisone for a week because of the bad reaction to that medication. I couldn't wear any shorts or a bathing suit for 2 years. It really messed with my self-esteem and hence forth I really started doing my research on different medications/treatments.</p>

        <p>No but I feel like I have have been falsely labeled with a mental illness "ADD" and my education got limited because I got treated like someone with learning disabilities but I could think like a normal human being and function normally, I didn't feel like I had any learning disabilities because I could think for myself and I don't even believe in it anymore because i figured out it's the education that limits your ability </p>
<p>The most funny thing is whenever I ask people "What is normal?" Nobody was ever able to answer it and that was before this idiocratic scamdemic, like people don't actually know what being a normal human being means.</p>
<p>It do make me wonder if it's true people can be falsely labeled with a mental illness to ruin someone life ? This make me question if mental illness is a real thing</p>

        <p>After I gave birth to my first I was pressured into the TDap vaccine. I had declined it twice, even by writing, then the nurse who came in around 3am after I had literally been awake over 48 hours and given birth told me it was so important for my baby and she didn‚Äôt understand why anyone would decline and I consented. After my second birth 2 years later they tried to do this again, even after I said I had it 2 years prior and it‚Äôs supposed to last 10 years, she said again it was to protect the baby. This time around I stood my ground better but I also was more annoyed. There is no research whatsoever that having it would have protected my baby when I just had it 2 years prior. She flat out lied to get me to take a vaccine that I didn‚Äôt even need! They are like vultures at the hospital.</p>
<p>Funny enough, my actual OB does not push vaccines during pregnancy at all (when they are actually recommended). She hands out a pamphlet and tells you that the flu and TDap are recommended during pregnancy but there are no studies on pregnancy women or their babies.</p>

        <p>Wow, fuck them.
This is what I hate the medical community. Pestering a woman who just gave birth and is awake for 48 hours after she said no twice is not consent! It is coercion! 
What would they call this if instead of a vaccine for your kid, she was asking you to have sex after you said no twice and were not in a  physically and mentally coherent state ? Rape. 
They basically use the same tactics that rapists do, they don‚Äôt take no for an answer, and they think this is ok.
I‚Äôm shocked that your OB actually told you that those shots aren‚Äôt studies on pregnant women, most of them conveniently leave that truth out.</p>

        <p>It is typical. And mainstream medical doctors are the front line, the executives. Compelling healthy people to do drugs and invasive procedures. See "asymptomatic" related terms for instance.</p>
<p>But it is nothing new. For over a century the allopathic medical model has caused a lot of harm at many levels to the point that it is considered the number one cause of mortality. MD directive treatments. This is not random</p>

<p>All this is happening because we do not have a free medical market anywhere. There are no options. What you experience is the result of it. This may give you a basic understanding.</p>

        <p>I went in to labor a week early with one of my kids. I was in the hospital for 12 hours but wasn't progressing, so the midwife wanted to start Pitocin or Cytotec. It wasn't even my due date yet!</p>
<p>We asked why, and were told it's hospital policy. My husband asked the midwife - if we came to your office like this, what would you do? She said she'd send us home to labor at home. So I asked to do the same - go home to labor at home. There was a huge argument about "but hospital policy" until we finally agreed to sign the Against Medical Advice papers and went home.</p>
<p>I gave birth on my due date in a labor that was under 3 hours, only 7 minutes of which were in the hospital.</p>

        <p>Women experience this a lot, no, virtually every time when giving birth in hospitals.</p>
<p>They get coerced into about every no-no procedures while their judgment is at it's weakest from utter exhaustion so they can barely resist or say no. (Remember, they're at this point sleep deprived and extremely in need of a patience from the pain they went through, a patience hospitals NEVER fvcking give you.)
Ranging from unnecessary cesarean to circumcision of their baby, to epidurals when she clearly said no, to the husband stitch (Google up the term, it's barbaric). </p>
<p>As for myself, I got vaccines I didn't need (the motherfucking flu) through my mother being coerced up to when I was ALREADY 12. I didn't even knew WHY or WHAT I was getting. All thanks to the cunt that is my cousin. My cousin is a stupid nurse that gets her nose in places unneeded. All Nurses Are Like That.</p>

        <p>Also, forgot to mention my school coerced my parents into sending me to a psychologist because I was at that time depressed - my father looked at me and said, "but you don't need that" and he was 100% right - I was depressed but it was NONE of their business. I dropped the unneeded therapy and got better ON MY OWN.

        <p>There have been studies both for and against masks. I am not for the idea of breathing in and out my own breath through a mask that has carcinogenic materials all day. No thank you.
Many of the studies for masks show very minimal benefit, if any at all.</p>
<p>If I had a raging Covid infection I would simply stay home (as I mostly already am) to protect people and sure, wear a mask too if I went out.</p>
<p>If I was around someone severely immunocompromised, or was severely immunocompromised myself then I would also support wearing one. </p>
<p>Without having a Covid infection, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to wear a mask 24/7, when it puts m own long-term health at risk. </p>
<p>Everything is a positive - negative analysis. There are negative to wearing masks and those are almost never considered, seeing as how the virus has a very very low death rate, and if I don‚Äôt have Covid, I don‚Äôt think I should need to wear one at all times.</p>
<p>With vaccines it‚Äôs the same: risk benefit. Every vaccine is different. I support rabies vaccine for animals and sometimes people, if necessary. I think some vaccines are more risky than others, and with everything else, you need to consider what is best for you.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs not literally insane at all. In fact there‚Äôs some research on this. The research outlines the physiological effects of masks, considering how they function and how they are made (material wise).</p>
<p>Long term effects of chronic mask wearing is unknown, but there‚Äôs reason and evidence to suggest why it may be harmful to us. We are essentially in a big experiment with known and unknown risks associated with mask wearing.</p>

        <p>No.
But if it did it wouldn‚Äôt matter.
Because religion is literally none of anyone‚Äôs business and has nothing to do with whether someone can also be scientific or not. Some of the greatest scientists have also been religious.
That being said, I was personally brought up without faith (my grandparents are Christians, Muslims, and Jewish) and continue to live my life without it too. I respect people who have different choices than mine, as our country was founded for freedom of speech and religious practice, safe from religious persecution.</p>
