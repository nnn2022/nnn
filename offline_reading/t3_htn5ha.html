    <strong>A hopeful anecdote for those that needed it today...</strong>
    <p><p>I started this as a comment, but then I thought a broader share of this might be good. I believe that hopeful anecdotes are key to help us keep up the good fight! I’m in Seattle, and you can imagine the crazies around here surrounding masks and basically ~~volunteering~~ begging for more government control. </p>
<p>But the other day in the grocery store I had a guy approach me, calmly, and simply ask why I wasn’t wearing a mask (he had one on thanks to our lovely <a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/information-for/you-and-your-family/face-masks-or-cloth-face-covering">mask mandate</a>). We proceeded to have a conversation and I told him that I’m not necessarily against masks (although some of the research I’ve seen with how <strong><em>disgusting</em></strong> reused masks are is changing my mind on that...), but ultimately it comes down to two things for me:</p>
<p>1) It’s not the government’s job to dictate to what I can and cannot do in regards to my own safety from a flu-like virus (basically this isn’t Ebola with a 50% mortality rate).  It is up to THE PEOPLE to define what risks they want to take in society (and business should define their own policies on masks, and then WE can decide if we want to shop there).  For every news article you find on pro mask, I can find a data-driven one supporting no masks...so maybe we can all just agree to disagree and <strong><em>at a minimum</em></strong> have consensus that safety from masks are inconclusive <strong><em>in a public setting where most social distancing guidelines are already in-place</em></strong>. Personal safety is...well...<strong><em>personal</em></strong>.</p>
<p>2) WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT KILLS PEOPLE. Did you know heart disease will likely kill ~650K people this year?  ...except now it’s probably more deaths because people aren’t exercising, and staying in their homes smoking weed and eating Cheetos...  And heart disease is one of MORE THAN TEN diseases that are deadlier than Covid. So please don’t tell me how my mask is so “critical” to save lives when it’s clearly a “symbol” of safety while everything else stays the same. </p>
<p>...and he ended taking off his mask...  I was shocked. </p>
<p>This won’t happen the majority of the time (especially in Seattle), but if one person can at least “think” after having a reasonable conversation, it gives me a some hope.  </p>
<p>We are all HUMANS and we need to start acting it. So many people are just really scared right now because they have no one else (calmly) telling them not to be. Our media is filth, and we need to keep trying to reach those who are tired of being scared of a virus the media has to <strong>tell you</strong> is scary and you have to <strong>get a test</strong> to even know if you have it!</p></p>

        <p>I mean...</p>
<p>The fact he approached you calmly and had a civil discussion meant he was already open to having his mind changed.</p>
<p>Sad fact is, people like him are rare. Most people will cling to their beliefs and opinions no matter what. And they are very "protective" of such, so they will react with hostility when people challenge what they believe in.</p>
