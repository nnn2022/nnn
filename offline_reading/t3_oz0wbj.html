    <strong>Even Christians are Doomed</strong>
    <p><p>Long story short: I was banned from /Christianity for making the connection between the Covid vax and the Mark of the Beast.</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>If even religious people can't even be quoted the Holy Scriptures and see the similarities with our daily life, where's the hope an atheist/sheep will?</p>
<p>You don't have to believe in that specifically, but OF ALL PEOPLE they should at least not be fazed by hearing believers about it. This world is going towards a bad place.</p></p>

        <p>But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, <em>having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power</em>.

        <p>r/Christianity is not Christian. You can try r/TrueChristian but they don't really like conspiracy stuff over there and, sadly, it seems that Christians on average are just as blind and brainwashed as everyone else.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, I shouldn't say that...I think a higher percentage of Christians on average are more awake to the truth than the general population, but it still seems disappointingly low.</p>

        <p>Yeah that place is nothing but LGBT affirming Christians. Full of trash. Like I get you want to be apart of the world and you're free to live like the world in the world. But as Christians we are called to reprimand and point out the sins of our fellow professing brothers and sisters. Homosexuality has no place in the Church Of Christ. Only in the world.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say Christians are as blind as everyone else, I think a majority of them are but the percentage is still lower than the general population which is overwhelmingly blind. </p>
<p>As evidence look at how upvoted Christian posts in this sub are. This is the exact opposite of almost every other sub on Reddit, or the net in general. </p>
<p>I would venture to say a large chunk if not a majority of this sub is some flavour of Christian or believes in God and Jesus' message. </p>
<p>A lot of the rest align with Christ's values without realising it too.</p>
<p>The lukewarm Christians and fake Christian shills on r/Christianity don't represent all Christians.</p>

<p>Yeah I would agree with that and have edited my comment accordingly. I think American Christians are likely more discerning than Canadian. My experience in my church and on r/TrueChristian is that most people are eating up the conspiracies/misinformation are dangerous narrative though.</p>

<p>I'm Catholic and I haven't been to Church in the last 18 months even though the mass mandate is back.  I refuse to get vaccinated at least right now and I'm not wearing a mask in Church as I feel all of these things have been politicized by the Church.</p>
<p>My wife has been going back and she has the same feelings about the vaccine as I do.  </p>
<p>Last weekend, the deacon at our church talked about how he wouldn't deny Catholics like Pelosi and Biden communion, because of the whole "the Church is a hospital for sinners" nonsense and that he is following the guidance of Pope Francis.  We use to have respect for him.</p>
<p>I'm debating whether or not we should write him, the pastor and the bishop, because my wife and I had been active in the pro-life community before the pandemic hit, and stuff like this seriously undermines the work we are trying to do.  The attitudes some of the clergy have is pure cowardice, and I would have no problem stating this to him.</p>

        <p>Theres a lot more to it (such as connection between our times/events right now and the Biblical End Times), but basically it states that when Satan rises, EVERYONE on Earth will receive a mark. [Although the Bible specifies on the head or right hand - in the Quran, on the nose I believe]. 
Those who refuse the Mark will be executed. 
Thus begins the Rapture ; when all believers are off the face of the Earth. </p>
<p>Also, notice how timely this is with the end of the use of cash; designed specifically to stop anyone not possessing their virtual money and isn't in good social credit standing.</p>
<p><em>Revelation 13:16-17
And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name.</em></p>

        <p>Again, Revelation is filled with allegory and symbolism and the meaning has been debated for millennia.  </p>
<p>At a minimum, the "Mark of the Beast" is something that people needed to accept to be a part of society at large, and it would be implemented by leaders who are the antithesis of what Christ/God/Christianity generally believes.  It would be a measure of control.</p>
<p>It's the same the the creation story in Genesis:  it was trying to convey how humans came to be to a generally illiterate audience that had no clue about evolutionary biology, geology and astrophysics, for example.</p>

        <p>Traditional Catholics won't knock you for that.  We have clergy on board with that notion.  For example:</p>
<p><strong>"Vaccines derived from the cells of cruelly murdered unborn children are clearly apocalyptic in character and may possibly foreshadow the mark of the beast (cf. Rev. 13:16)."</strong></p>

        <p>The mark of the beast follows a very specific chronological order of events. It is completely incorrect to say that the vaccination or the passport is the sign of the beast. We do not even have the beast system, which ties hand in hand with the Anti Christ revealing himself... remember that these two people are uniting the world under a GLOBAL government.</p>
<p>The anti christ reveals himself where?</p>
<p>In the temple at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>How? By committing the abomination of desolation. </p>
<p>Problem is that the temple doesn’t exist yet; the Done of Rock is built in its place. </p>
<p>The temple was destroyed in 70AD.</p>
<p>We do not even have the foundations yet.</p>
<p>I do believe that everything we experience is leading up to that system, baby steps, but it is fundamental incorrect to say the vaccination or passports is the sign of the beast.</p>

Don’t come at me with “muh revelations” unless you’ve actually studied this. You cannot understand revelations without the book of Daniel.</p>

        <p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, 2 not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of [a]Christ had come. 3 Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of [b]sin is revealed, the son of perdition, 4 who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits [c]as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.</p>
<p>If what you said were scriptural let justified, you then have to say that the abomination of desolation happens inside a body rather than a temple.</p>

        <p>Paul rebuked Peter in Galatians 2.
Let’s cut the nonsense out of this idea that Christians are just supposed to sit idly by like some passive hippy.
Christians are to rebuke lies and moreso rebuke incorrect use of Gods word - that <em>misleads people</em></p>

        <p>You're conflating attack with rebuke. Rebuking someone is correcting them, not calling them an idiot. You're attacking someone and trying to claim you're rebuking or correcting someone to shield yourself. </p>
<p>Colossians 4:6 - Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</p>
<p>Philippians 4:5 - Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.</p>

        <p>You can buy online. The vax does not inhibit your ability to buy AND SELL. It inhibits your freedom to move around.</p>
<p>This is as asinine as when people thought bank cards were the sign of the beast because you could hold it in your hand and it had potential to be cancelled on a whim.</p>
<p>People are looking at the vax and IGNORING not only the blatant scriptural context but the <em>SPECIFICS</em> of IN the hand or forehead.</p>
<p>But let me guess, because the vax is in the body, it counts as in the hand and in the head right?</p>
