<title>Apparently there's 10 variants so far(3 originating in 2020/ 7 in 2021?), Moderna had P2 study done with 3rd dose targeted at South African Variant. Governments are only offering first 2 doses for free, Pfizer CEO hints at yearly vaccinations. Where do you tink it's heading, come next winter?</title>

        <p>The brilliant Michael Burry tweeted almost a year ago that vaccines wont work against Coronaviruses. Humans evolved over eons to live with them, developing natural immunity. In most helathy people, they are easily handled. When people accept this simple truth and learn to deal with it by using safe and effective drugs like Ivermectin to treat the sick and maybe use it prophylactically during local outbreaks, we can end the pandemic today, worldwide.</p>

        <p>Yep, I was going to answer thousands as well. They didn't start playing the variant game until they realized people would fall for it. Now it's the only thing they seem to have left. On any given day, they will have ample variants to choose from.</p>

        <p>Yes but there's some variants that appear to become predominant every season, like Delta is now. Also coincidentally, the first 2 doses don't work so well against it, as they don't for the rest of the special-named variants. Last winter and spring had the S.African and Brazil variants in the spotlight, but there was no vaccines back then. With the first 2 doses, the field has been probed, adoption has been successfull, and from then on 'sky's the limit' in that every predominant variant will have its own booster and vacinees will have to take it, or else potentially face worse outcomes than even non-vaccinees (as it seems to be the case with UK data on Delta Variant)</p>

        <p>To tie it all together, Moderna pretty much admits that first 2 doses are not enough and boosters will need to be administered for each variant. Variants apparently sprouting faster since vaccinations began, and the UK offical data showing 2dose vaccinees having bad (deaths and hospitalizations) outcomes from delta variant, I think it's safe to assume that vaccinated people will be finishing the year with having at least 3 doses in their bodies, and paying for them starting from the 3rd.</p>
<p>Considering the sunk cost fallacy, it won't stop at 2doses because that would mean admitting mass vaccination push was for nothing, and seeing more and more full(2 doses) people die would be terrible PR, so mm will keep on pushing people to get booster shots, news would report on the most common variant per time windows and people would line up for that month's/season's most common variant's booster shot. </p>
<p>I have no ideea what the effect on the body so many mRNA injections would have. And with every subsequent injection pressenting its own risks(some people getting AEs after 1st, some being fine after 1st but getting AEs after 2nd), and considering the implications of hyping up your immune system so often with novel mRNA therapies - are unknown for the immune system's well functioning and overall health... having people's bodies produce ever changing spike protein versions in a never ending 'arms race' with an infinitely mutatable virus, where can all of this lead?</p>
