    <strong>UK - I would be very grateful for your discussion on my opinions about COVID19</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all. </p>
<p>This post was sparked by a reddit comment I made on another sub-reddit (from which I was promptly banned) and 'recycled' as a comment on a a post here at NNN.</p>
<p>I have struggled to grasp the logic of many of the measures used to supress the pandemic, at points becoming angry with the way the UK government has handled the matter.</p>
<p>I have tried to summarise all of my positions on the various hot-topics surrounding COVID, and thought I would make a thread here to see what others think. My opinion is that I hold a fair and centerist stance on the matter i.e. I recognise the pandemic as a societal issue, but fear that it is being weaponised by governments to introduce measures that will ultimately not benefit society as a whole. I have often been lablled as a consipiracy theorist here in the UK, although I do not agree with that assessment at all.</p>
<p>Anyway here are some of my points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is certainly a virus / pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is likely, I believe, on the balance of probability to have been a 'leak' from the research institute in Wuhan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The release of the virus was not planned i.e. it was not purposefully introduced into the public. There is no solid evidence of any Bill Gates/five G/lizard overlord plot to control the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That said, governments all over the world are using this as a guise to push top-down authoritarian measures onto their citizens, which are disproportionate to the risk posed by the disease. Examples being 'enforced business closures' and vaccine passports, pushed by Macron and now being snuck in by the backdoor here in the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wearing a mask, based on a common sense approach alone, is likely to reduce the spread of any diseases spread via droplets. However, the frilly gaping single-ply disposable masks used by the population at large in the UK will do very little, if anything, to prevent the spread of the disease. At this stage, where the majority of the population (and largely all those vunerable to severe illness) have recieved their vaccine, the mask is as much a symbol of subservance and virtue than it is an effective tool against cutting down the spread of infection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccinations are generally a very positive practice and have saved countless lives across the years, although as with any medical procedure one needs to assess their own risk and be ultimately responsible for their own health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forced vaccination in order to access certain facilities (pubs, nightclubs, sports arena's, concerts etc.) is a breach of human rights. One is born with the rights to patronise these places and fundamentally one should not have to undergo a medical procedure in order to 'opt in' to certain societal privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not personally satisified that the vaccines as they stand have enough long term real world data to convince me (young male, no respiratory conditions pre-existing) to have the vaccine. No matter the level of funding, I do not believe it is possible can do 10 years of research adequately in 1 year. I understand that the technology behind the MRNA has been researched at length before, but I am incredibly hesitant as this is the first time it has been deployed en-masse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To a very limited degree, we are all responsible for the health of the general public. To give an example, I don't think that it would be acceptable for me to drive the wrong way down a motorway, or to tip my businesses waste materials in the local drinking water reservior. That said, the individual is ultimately responsible for their own health and I cannot therefore be held infinately responsible for preventing others catching COVID. I am frustrated particularly whereby people who will willingly smoke, take recreational drugs, drink copious amounts of alcohol and have poor diets, berate me for posing a risk to their health. I am also frustrated when larger corporates, that regularly pollute the environment, avoid taxes and national obligations, produce 'sin' products (like tobacco etc) push vaccine mandates onto their employee's or use vaccines in their marketing campaigns - see the recent Heineken adverts for one example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe that in the UK, the 'selfish' position is to clamour for repeated lockdowns and similar measures, not to decide not to recieve the vaccine largely for other's sake. I believe the mental and physical health damages caused by the lockdowns (not COVID itself) have been grossly underreported in our national and mainstream media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following on from 10, I am very unhappy about the manner is which the government has awarded grants and COVID support payments to individuals and businesses. As an accountant, I have seen countless examples of wealthy commercial property owners gleefully taking the £10,000 rates grant, whilst individuals that work more hand-to-mouth get nothing or at best, very little. It is highly inequitable and I am not happy that as someone who worked throughout the pandemic, I am going to be responsible for paying back debt that we have been saddled with so that neighbours could stay at home for months and have BBQ's in the sun. Labour and Conservatives have failed to correctly fund the NHS for years, to the point where it has become an ineffecient organisation filled with beaurocracy and middle management and almost unfit for purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whilst I believe in Public Healthcare, to me there is cognitive dissonance in the way the government treats the NHS. We were encouraged to 'clap to the sky' for months on end in support of the NHS. At it's height, the NHS became effectively a quasi-religion. Now we find that the government is in a pay dispute with many NHS workers. The doctors and nurses at hospitals, from personal experience, are great people. However, for a long time GP's have become 'gatekeepers' to the NHS. Getting a face-to-face appointoment has been nigh on impossible for years prior to the pandemic. The organisation needs to be overhauled if we want a socialised healthcare system that is sustainable in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SAGE are un elected body who hold disproportionate power over the decisions of government. They are comprised of as many behavourial psycologists as disease experts, and I believe are politicised. See - Susan Michie, a member of the UK communist party who is a clinical psychologist. SAGE's predicitions, particularly those by Mr Neil Ferguson, have been shown time and time to be at best wildly inaccurate and have at each step over-estimated the severity of the pandemic dramatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The suppression of any counter narrative and any lack of debate on the COVID issue has been discraceful. By ignoring the many mass protests around the world, in London in particular, the BBC/SKY/ITV have become untrusted in my eyes. Reddit, Facebook, Instagram are all acting of the arbiters of morality and science all of a sudden and I feel it is big tech overreach. I would be very interested in watching a government scientist debate someone like Mr Vernon Coleman for example. If these people or 'vectors or misinformation' are spreading such plainly incorrect information, surely it would be a simple case of one televised or streamed debate where the public could watch the 'misinformation' pusher squirm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have quite a lot of other points, but I need some shut eye after work. It has been helpful just to vent today. All the best chaps and chapesses. I would be really pleased if anyone has any comments on this - even if you disagree with my opinions on the matter!</p></p>

        <p>Vaccine passports work in the U.K. for many different reasons. 
1) the under 35s are so against, myself included, I am 34. 
2) staff would simple just not turn up to work as I’ve asked train staff metro link staff( the ones that give out masks and one was a door woman and the other working in the Apollo in Manchester. They both said they hadn’t the jab and was 23. They said bars and the music industry would suffer as staff would go on strike. This includes some football stewards as well. 
3) I went to hospital today and asked my surgeon if I’d be forced to have the jab to have surgery. I’ve had 3 in the last year. He’s the Uk top upper limb surgeon for his age and just behind one older surgeon. I won’t mention the hospital or his name to not get him in trouble. His words were “ the NHS will never force people to have a jab, it’s not what we are about or stand for at all” I take that as he and other nurses would go on strike. He does surgery on footballers, celbs and most likely MPs. He also does about 7 surgeries or more a week. I’ve seen him 12 times in the last year and had serval phone calls with him and his team. They are lovely people and under 40.
4) the tram ladies told me someone had lay on the lines to protest and cost Metrolink most likely a hell of a lot of money in tram fees and other expenses and must likely fines by the government.
5) the rest of the world are fighting with the police and they police offers of Britain and rest of the world don’t get paid enough to enforce it.
6) the Army are a last resort as they have microwave crowd desperal weapons( 5G) wave tech, it’s been used on the UN buildings in many
different countries, water guns and lastly bullets. Shooting your own people in the U.K would make people burn there cities down. 
7) they may want the burning of old buildings to build new ones and bring the peace keepers in. </p>
<p>I certainly won’t be having the jab but it’s personal choice and I can understand why old people have it.</p>

        <p>Fellow brit here. Yes, you have pretty much nailed it. I am a bit more willing to countenance the possibility that this is an engineered scenario, but at the end of the day the difference between escaped from a lab and "escaped" from a lab may not be that great. If this is a 'plandemic' I suspect the purpose is to force through a rapid reduction in carbon emissions.</p>

        <p>I agree with you, except the Wuhan leak part, I think it was on purpose. This is business, just like 911 was, but on a larger scale. The end goal will always be more money for the corporations/higher ups while using media to blind and or brainwash the population into thinking that their lives are in danger and that we can trust the government because they will do everything they can to " protect " us from nothing. This lead into dividing the population, brainwashed vs skeptics/critical thinkers, so we can keep arguing with each other meanwhile they kill us off slowly and make a shitload of money in the process.</p>

        <p>These are very fair observations. There’s nothing conspiratorial here, all facts appear accurate, some very good questions are raised.</p>

<p>Exactly.  An open televised debate on the issues.</p>
<p>What happens instead is that one of "our guys" will say something, and then one of "their guys" will DEBUNK it with an article or video.</p>
<p>And then for most people that "debunk" is enough.  Even if they dont understand it completely.  They say "Oh well I heard something about what you said, but dont you know it was DEBUNKED?"</p>
<p>But there is never a chance to debunk the debunk.</p>
