    <strong>We need to stop calling it “New Normal” and call it “Temporarily, For Now”</strong>
    <p><p>I hate calling it the “new normal”. I don’t believe we should expect permanent masks. Or Permanent social distancing. Or permanent remote learning/work. </p>
<p>And that I think is the problem. I really believe this backlash is somewhat being driven by the wrong message.  We hear “New Normal” and we assume forever. But when people voice there displeasure against the “New Normal” people a lot of times respond “that’s not what they mean. It’s not permanent “</p>
<p>I think if we started advertising this as “For Now” or “Temporary”, we may see more compliance to getting through this. If the general population were told repeatedly “Do masks, distancing, etc, “for now” or based on NZ, conquerored this after a month or 2 Giveus a realistic achievable time frame so people have a light at the end of the tunnel.  And not threats of “if you don’t do what we say, we’ll go back to previous phases”</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I think most people feel like OP. They think it will go away and those who are pushing it, want it to go away "once it's safe". But we are long past any sort of rational discussion about what "safe" is and the goalposts keep moving. </p>
<p>I think if more people realized, it is relatively permanent unless something drastic happens they wouldn't be along for the ride. </p>
<p>The tell is that in the beginning, right from the beginning, just days after stay home, 15 days to flatten the curve was, it was "the new normal". Not, "let's wait and see how the data holds and let the science be our guide". The new normal was being talked about and it was right then and there that I knew, we aren't getting out of this ever and definitely not without a fight. It just takes others longer to get it, I guess.</p>
<p>I thought the protests would have snapped people out of it. But they shoved that Orwellian "report" down our throats that despite all of the pictures we saw of protestors without masks, the politicians in crowds of people without masks. That "oddly enough the protests did not contribute to the spread of COVID-19, but may have slowed it." "That this might not be the case though, if others broke social distancing to protest things like the lockdown itself."</p>
<p>And then suddenly, out of the blue... As if on schedule as the protests and their fallout fell from the front pages. Then came the surging cases in red states. The travel ban instituted by Cuomo and the Balkanized Northeast that just barely didn't include California. At first, until Cali needed another lockdown... we're heading into the third quarter here, this is the quarter that decides what kind of economy Donald Trump goes into the election with and like clockwork Gavin Newsom says it is necessary to go back to phase 1. </p>
<p>I don't like Donald Trump and I want someone to defeat him, but I certainly don't want to be held hostage to defeat him and it seems like, at this point, that's part of it. </p>
<p>What terrifies me is what comes next.</p>

<p>What if this lockdown was a test run to get people ready to just basically wait indefinitely for a vaccine, and just indefinitely lockdown?</p>
<p>Everyone in this sub somehow has this irrational assumption, counter to every single piece of media and narrative so far, that this is just going to stop, lmao.</p>

        <p>I think this is close to the truth. I think we are seeing a coordinated effort to permanently transform society into a more authoritarian state. By having people wait until the vaccine they can keep this going for long enough that it will be here to stay.</p>

        <p>I'd actually like to be optimistic about this. Once the election comes, there will be no need for a politicized virus anymore. Biden will end up "defeating" it instantaneously and there will be no more reason to use it as a means of getting Trump out.</p>

        <p>That's one of the main issues with this whole thing - the language involved. Communication is key for everything, and I really can't help but feel the language being used is done deliberately.</p>
<p>Social distancing, for instance. Fucking hate the term, because the word "social" has way more connotation than just being physically close to people. Considering how much of a divide there is between everyone right now, I really do think the term physical distancing would be more appropriate, but nope, let's all make sure to keep socially distant from people who might be infected or not as careful as you.</p>
<p>New normal implies a long term continuation - that our old way is abnormal. I hope that it isn't, but suspect it might be. Which is a damn shame, really. The whole of society has been easily changed thanks to a small virus, and the language being used seems to be conditioning us to accept these radical changes.</p>

        <p>The narrative now is social is bad.  We are social beings. That’s undeniable.  They’re jamming the narrative that groups are bad. Being face to face, well, mask to mask is built into our DNA. forcing social distancing long term I think will become utterly impossible. There will be a time (I believe sooner than later) that human nature for everyone will simply overcome the lockdown and distance mandates. There is so many things that would just disappear. Sports ( no sport can survive long term TV only). Conventions, casinos, concerts etc. Not only industries, but long term cancellation of community events will also have a huge effect.  No more 4th of July fireworks, no more local car shows, farmers markets, carnivals. Shit, bars will be closed forever!!!</p>
<p>Yes we have some of those things. But EVERYTHING in  lockdown states have restricted capacity, limited hours, etc. even the states that opened faster than others are slowly reverting back to more restrictions. </p>
<p>But no business can survive long term operating like this. No local restaurant can operate at 25 or 50% capacity.  There are very few that can. Those that initially designated as essential seem to be doing well. Amazon target Walmart Home Depot. Can you imagine a world with only stores?</p>
<p>It’s also inevitable that schools will need to reopen. It’s proven that remote learning was an utter failure. Sure there are those edge cases of kids exceeding on remote learning. But overall, it was a catastrophe.  It’s not “it’s only a matter of time” before we get it right.  But there is no way to get it right. Parents cannot become teachers, principals, etc. we have our own work to do. Either at the office or home, we simply cannot just drop everything every time our kids are confused or lost. Many kids absolutely need the in school interaction. My son has adhd. He fails miserably in traditional schools. His attention span cannot handle the regimented school schedule. He was 15 when started skipping school. But our district is extremely lucky to have established an alternative high school that adapts to each kids learning style. My son excelled at math. He was able to complete honors math in 3/4 of a semester. He was able to do it at his own pace. Reading and writing are more difficult for him so they spend more time on those. As much as needed. There is absolutely no way to replicate that experience remotely. </p>
<p>My long point is, we will never eradicate this. Ever. It’s here to stay and a society cannot function without the social aspect of life.</p>

        <p>Ditto.  But I'm not sure either is as close as people think.  </p>
<p>As twisted as it seems, I think society will have to accept this virus will kill a certain number of people. The rate long term will settle at some level.  I don't know the rate for the flu or covid. But hypothetically, what if flu mortality rate is 1 ( I know it's not, but it's easier to use a whole nber in my analysis). </p>
<p>As a society, we have decided that the flu mortality rate of my hypothetical 1 is totally acceptable rate and we are ok with whatever that equates to in deaths.  Nobody raises an eyebrow when 1 million die a year from the flu.  Like I said, it's a twisted thought, but I believe if we want to use "New Normal" than we have to move our level  of acceptable rate (hypothetically, say, 3).</p>
<p>Yes, that's 3 times higher (maybe long term it's 2 or 1.5).  But to continue as a functional society, we have to move to a different expectation.  At some point in time the number of deaths from the flu seemed very high. Now it's accepted as the norm.  </p>
<p>We just have to accept covid as the new norm.  And let society return a completely functional state.</p>

        <p>OP is being reasonable.  And while others may not want to see it, it is similar to the 1918 flu when you look at the temporary lockdowns, masks, etc.</p>
<p>There is no concerted effort to make this the "new normal".  </p>
<p>The problem is, the longer people resist true social distancing and wearing masks...the longer we'll have to deal with outbreaks.</p>

        <p>That's kind of the point I'm making.  The world returned to normal after that devastation -- why do you believe it won't after this?  There is no conspiracy to control the population and suppress the economy.  It's absurd and paranoid to truly believe that.  Who's the real doomer?  Someone who believes this is temporary, or someone who believes this is an organized attempt to control the population?  It's temporary.  Just do your part to keep others safe and yourself, and wait it out.</p>

There will likely be some lasting effects during our lifetime - as I imagine the roaring 20's was influenced by the 1918 flu and the corresponding attitude "damn, life is short, live it to the fullest while you can."</p>
