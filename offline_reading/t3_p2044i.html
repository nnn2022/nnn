    <strong>Want to fill your conspiracy coffers? I have a little rabbit hole for you.</strong>
    <p><p>Remember swine flu? Then president Barack Obama paid a visit to the Mexican President as the outbreak began. Shortly after their meeting, Mexico City was locked down and people were forced to wear, you guessed it, masks. I was told this by my Mexican wife a year or two later and told her she was being silly. Why would they do something like that? Now I'm not so sure she was being silly.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time in Mexico and one thing I've noticed is people bow to authority there, presumably because of long-standing societal oppression by the Catholic church. I love Mexican culture, but the juxtaposition between so-called machismo and the reality of their often cowardly outlook is a bit sad.</p>
<p>Mexico City specifically is a cesspool of COVID fear. I was there recently and establishments have shoe washing stations and children aren't allowed in stores. I went to the museum and was required to walk through a tunnel to be sprayed. The fear is visible in people's eyes. They cower in the presence of each other. It's truly pathetic.</p>
<p>If this thing was planned, then the swine flu in Mexico City was a testbed, and the timing of Obama's visit is telling. My wife told me on several occasions that the US uses Mexico to test various economic policies because of loose regulations there. I never got her to qualify her statements but now I'm thinking it might be worth looking into.</p>
<p>Just a thought I wanted to get out there in case someone wants to put in the time to flesh it out. I know it seems lazy but my researching days are behind me. I used to do it for a living and I just don't have the energy for it anymore.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></p>

        <p>6 months in, Obama told the CDC to stop testing for it. The CDC has posted on their site that in 2009 if you had the flu, you most likely had the swine flu. Due to nothing really to prescribe other than some antivirals maybe, the swine flu was put to bed.</p>

        <p>This is like a Latam thing. There is an immediate deference to authority thatâ€™s worse than other places in the world. In Brazil there was what could basically be described as a military coup in the 1960s and older people that were around for that actually reminisce back to that time in a positive way.</p>

        <p>It's not just the church. There is a class system and those in the upper tier are very oppressive by US standards. I lived there for awhile and was married to a Mexican. I constantly made an "ass" of myself by being nice to lower tiers of society in front of upper tiers.</p>
<p>The US could and would pay or bribe Mexican leadership into absolutely anything. But, on the whole, the Mexican people are much more free than we are, as are most Latino countries. Given your stories about the rules that may seem contradictory, but go to them and talk to them and you will understand :)</p>

        <p>I think it depends. Certain laws are oppressive, but generally I agree that it feels a lot more free there. Upward mobility is still a thing there too, which is cool. Anybody can grind for a while and really get ahead.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Its a beautiful country with beautiful people, despite its many problems. It's my true shtf destination. Not sure if you have spent much time out of the city. If not, make your wife take you on a countryside road trip. It's absolutely amazing!</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve been comparing this virus to the 2009 H1N1 viral outbreak in a few of my posts. Most notably the swine flu was nearly twice as infectious, and we didnâ€™t see the same sort of tyrannical lockdown measures. The vaccine was properly studied and rolled out in a healthy manner. Best part of it is that it was optional for those who wanted it. The end of the pandemic was declared about a year after the outbreak started.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s an interesting timeline if you want to compare:</p>
