    <strong>Your honour, she was old enough to consent</strong>
    <p><p>W-w-w-ell she was 10 but it wasn't her birthday so she was over 10 so basically 11 but 11 is a very un even number so let's make it 12. And 12 is basically a teenager so let's change it to 13 but 13 is also a prime so let's change it to 14. but going off the way of rating movies in the UK goes U, PG, 12, 15, 18, but she's 14 so she can handle 15 movies so she's basically 15. But the youngest age allowed to join the military in the UK Is 16. Although could pass as 16 and join the military so she's basically 16, but she'd need to do 44 weeks of training for the military and then it'd almost be Christmas so she'd take 2 weeks off and then she'd be 17. But since she's in the military she will likely be offered alcohol, but you have to be 18 to drink alcohol in the UK so she is basically 18. So your honour she was old enough to consent</p></p>
