        <p>Here in Arizona I still see it constantly. Just 2 days ago it was 115 degrees outside and there was a dude walking completely by himself down the sidewalk with a mask. I just can't fathom how low your IQ and critical thinking has to be to even place it on your face IN THE DESERT like a compliant dog. </p>

        <p>Damn that’s bad! We are having a minor heatwave here so it’s been in the high 70s here on the coast which is normally pretty comfortable but it’s been humid so it feels warmer. And nobody is taking their mask off! I live by a hospital and tons of drs &amp; dental offices so every day I see the employees walking on their breaks and they don’t even take their masks off outside!</p>

        <p>I put this:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You won't read this because you guys don't read, but that's a SUPER easy question! I'm happy to answer it for the others who actually read.</p>
<p>The 7 Signs You're In A Cult</p>
<p>Opposing critical thinking</p>
<p>You guys: Don't read, don't watch, don't think. Any opposing views are immediately censored, even simple questions that might be perceived as even slightly questioning the narrative are deleted. Information directly from the CDC website is labeled as "misinformation" if it's framed in a way that's negative toward the vaccine.</p>
<p>Us: We let you guys troll in here all day. Hell, most of us try to help you see the light. We provide links (you never read), we provide videos (you never watch), we try to reason with you using the same data you have and you don't think. We try very hard to get you to use critical thinking. You guys just refuse. Probably because you're in a cult. But keep reading, you'll see why I say that!</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolating members and penalizing them for leaving.</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: Do I really even have to explain this one? You people are very violent about forcing people to take the vaccine. You literally want people's rights to be taken away if they don't comply to be a test subject in an experiment. You doxx anyone that questions the narrative, and many subs now auto-ban anyone that comments here. Even if it's just to troll. Want to work? Vaccine. Want to see your friends? Vaccine. Want to be a human being? Vaccine.</p>
<p>Us: We obviously welcome anyone willing to ask questions and have an open mind. We also don't dox, ridicule, or block people who admit to having the vaccine, or thinking of taking the vaccine. We believe in choice - not compulsion.</p>
<ol>
<li>Emphasizing special doctrines outside scripture</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: In this case, the CDC is the "scripture," and your mainstream news outlets are the special doctrines. When the CDC was all about turning you into a cave dweller, everyone was all about their rules! Listen to the CDC! Trust the science! But when the CDC says it's okay to take off masks, stop social distancing, go back to work...you people are still violently holding onto the masks and distancing - and literally attacking people who are following CDC guidelines of going back to normal!</p>
<p>Us: Hey, score one for you, because I would say we do that more than anyone! Only because we have to, though, because your special doctrine (MSM) has taken over all forms of readily available communication. We have to go to other sources to find the truth, usually from censored medical professionals and fired undercover news reporters. We certainly wish the media was a reliable source, though!</p>
<ol>
<li>Seeking inappropriate loyalty to their leaders</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: Praise be to Lord Fauci, may a thousand masks be upon him! James Corden shall sing songs in his name, and many works of art will bare his holy face!!</p>
<p>Us: Fuck all world leaders right now. Every last one of them. We have no leaders, because we are free thinkers. I would say we all probably like Zuby though for sure.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dishonoring the family unit</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: How many posts have been made in here of people bemoaning the fact that they're the only person in their family not to be a test subject, and how horrible and vile their family is to them? Very rarely do we get a post where the OP says that their family is being respectful of their decision. Maybe 1 out 12.</p>
<p>Us: Yeah, it's very simple. You can get the vaccine if you want. We don't care. All we ask is that you don't make us and you mind your own business about it. We don't care if you're "afraid" or you think we'll "kill grandma." You're very behind the science on that. We aren't going to ruin our lives because of your ignorance. Be the test subject. Have fun. Leave us out of it. We may be disappointed in family members that get the vaxx, but we don't act anything like you animals.</p>
<ol>
<li>Crossing Biblical boundaries of behavior (sexual purity and personal ownership)</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: Literally want to physically force the vaccine on people, or take away their basic human rights if we don't comply. You want vaccine passports, in order to work and travel. You want to make anyone who does not want to be a test subject into a subhuman person. Comply or die! You want to remove bodily autonomy - a God-given right.</p>
<p>Us: WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF YOU GET THE VACCINE OR WEAR A MASK. GO FOR IT. JUST LEAVE US OUT OF IT. We don't attack you for getting it, we don't dox you or harass you. But you better believe, we are ready to defend ourselves against your tyranny.</p>
<ol>
<li>Separation from the Church (Society)</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: As I've detailed many times above, and as you've surely stated yourself, you don't see us as humans. You see us as plague rats. For a "plague" that's currently killing almost no one in a world of over 7 billion people. You want us removed from society - probably put in camps, I bet - until we comply with your little experiment. Until we're in the same sinking ship as you. You're quite literally evil people, and you're quite literally - by textbook definition - in a cult.</p>
<p>Us: Well, you're trying to separate us... but here we are... together :)</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for playing, VERIFIABLE CULTIST</p>

        <p>Haha that was me on Tuesday after they announced the state was wide open and the unvaccinated could take off their masks. I was standing at my kitchen sink (kitchen is in the front of the house and the window looks out over the front yard) and I saw a masked woman walk by with her dog. I was tempted to open the window and yell at her take off the damn mask and enjoy the fresh air!</p>

        <p>Call me a coward but I'm just going to wear a mask inside the stores until everybody stops wearing them. I don't have time to risk dealing with some asshat's bullshit that won't leave me alone. I'm currently in no interest of dealing with the general population and just focusing on saving myself. But I'm willing to stand up if they start bullying other people for wearing or not wearing masks.</p>

        <p>That was my experience as well. It’s only been 2 days and already seeing less masks then day 1, including many places where the employees have ditched them as well. I’m right in the middle of LA too! For as long as I’ve been looking forward to this, it’s been so fucking long here that it’s still surreal to me to be able to go grocery shopping without a mask.</p>

        <p>Lol I’m in there at the bottom. The deleted comment above me said “why are we focusing on the most neurotic?” and was downvoted so I commented then got my first warning, which to be honest is surprising it’s taken this long.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but most people here in CA are still donning masks, despite being vaccinated. Was at the dentist this a.m. with a guy wearing a mask with "I'm vaccinated but wear this mask for you" printed on it . He was conversing with the receptionist and laughingly said, " don't want to be confused with an anti vax republican." 🤷‍♀️  I was one of maybe 5 people I saw in Walmart grocery NOT wearing one yesterday. This world is crazy.</p>

        <p>Is anyone else worried that life only seems free on the surface because no masks but now to get/keep a job or actually get in to places you will need the shot with the actual proof that you did? This has happened for concerts, its happened to me with certain businesses and my own building's gym. Haven't tried getting a job again yet, just some freelance. If I succeed in finding a job that doesn't need the card then what, I get sectioned off to a specific non-vax area and treated differently? Get hate from the rest of my coworkers? Looking at florida now, just in case.
I'm not getting a fake because I think that's a trap for when it goes digital and they can easily verify that you lied.
Also in my part of LA I'm seeing almost no one not have masks still.</p>

        <p>Ha are you kidding me? I’m in the Bay Area and nothing has changed much. I was about to make a post about eating at a restaurant for dinner today, where my family were the only people not wearing masks. The wait to get in was staged outside, where everyone was wearing a mask. A family including 2 small children were wearing K95 masks and the temperature was in the 90s today. People wearing masks at their table immediately after eating, and still the same amount of fuckers driving alone with masks on. This is called permanent psychological damage. We’re too soft here and people are now broken.</p>

        <p>I haven’t been in the Bay Area during Covid but as bad as it’s been down in LA, it doesn’t sound nearly as bad as up there. I feel like SF, Portland, and Seattle are the 3 worst cities and will take the longest to unravel the mask hysteria. Here in LA, only 3 days into reopening and already seeing way less masks, even by employees. So great to see.</p>
