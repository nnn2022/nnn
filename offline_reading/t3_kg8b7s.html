    <strong>How many government lies will people continue to believe?</strong>
    <p><p>So let me get this straight. COVID-19 becomes the worst pandemic in a century (although the survival rate is 99.7% for those over 65 and 99.9% for those under 65). All we hear is “Hospitals are overwhelmed and there’s no beds” even though only one external field hospital out of the hundreds set up were ever used (NYC). De Blasio orders Covid positive patients to be moved into nursing homes to “clear bed space”, which results in over 10000 deaths. Andrew Cuomo states that “we have no ventilators and people will die”, then when questioned magically finds so many unused ventilators Up-State that they begin to loan them to other states. Fauci screams “masks and social distancing”, yet NJ, NY, CA, and WA have never eased their mask mandates have have larger outbreaks than TX, FL, and TN which had no mask mandates. We have all learned if you go to the gym or church, you’ll kill hundreds by infecting them, but if you go to the liquor store or Costco you’re fine. Trump says in the debates “we will have a vaccine by end of the year”. Biden, Fauci, and the Media all call him a liar and say there’s no chance in hell. Three large pharmaceutical companies announce vaccines one week after the election, including the company funded by Warp Speed. Then Democrats complain that it’s “irresponsible to announce the vaccine before Biden is sworn in.”  We also get new stimulus that was held up by Pelosi, who is now suddenly willing to negotiate because “we are getting a new president”.  Finally with vaccines being rolled out, there’s suddenly a “new” strain emerging in the UK that spreads faster than the old virus and its “unknown if the vaccine will work against the new strain”. I believe if people swallow this spoonful of government horseshit then yes, we need a big ass pandemic to thin out the ignorance amongst us. This virus is nothing more than government control. You see it daily. Politicians forcing people to close businesses, dictating where people can go, telling parents they can’t take their kids to school, all the while these exact same politicians break the very rules they made. I’m both Interested and terrified to see where this finally ends up. I have been fortunate enough to have learned how to hunt, farm, and fix things. I’m also fortunate enough to have all the guns, ammo, and land I’ll need. I hope you all have the opportunity to acquire the same because I do not see this situation ending on a positive note.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah because most people don't even understand "The Science" or that it can be conflicting. But it's "The Science" after all, and what's above that? The God that few people truly believe in anymore? What? They need something to follow.</p>
