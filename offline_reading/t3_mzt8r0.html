        <p>The ignorance here is stunning.  "My mask kept me from getting sick until it didn't, and then I felt TERRIBLE!"  "If I can continue to avoid illness...."</p>
<p>Or let your immune system work, and colds are nothing but mild annoyances.  My 2 kids in daycare have brought home several colds in the last year.  Annoying, but nothing more.  Probably one was covid (there have been exposures up and down our street) but we haven't been tested, because who cares.</p>
<p>And now my whole family (and friends!) have great immune systems and needn't be afraid of colds going around.</p>

        <p>I’ve worn masks in crowded stores and worked from home.  I haven’t gotten sick or felt sick in over a year.  I’ll probably still get sick from something later this year as things get back to normal.  I’ll drink some OJ and get over it as I always do. </p>
<p>Your kids from day care brought home colds?  So what?  That doesn’t mean you’re any better off than me going forward.  You’re still going to deal with seasonal colds and flus and so will I when things open back up.  </p>
<p>I’m fine with letting my immune system handle the common cold.  I’d rather let vaccines help me out in dealing with Covid, the flu, chicken pox, meningitis, etc...</p>

        <p>People previously infected with SARS-COV-2 produce T-cells which helps against re-infection?  Neat.  Great for them. </p>
<p>Letting 50-80% of the population get infected while .5-2%+ die isn’t a viable nor is it an ethical strategy. </p>
<p>I’d rather as many people as possible build immune responses through vaccines.  That’s less deaths, less suffering, less hospitalizations, etc...</p>
<p>Again.  Social distancing for 1-2 years does not mean your body loses its ability to fight colds.  I’ve refuted that point already.</p>

        <p>No, try again, people who previously had other coronaviruses make them more resistant to sars-cov-2.  </p>
<p>Also look up how flu exposure (and vaccines) make you more resistant to other flu strains.</p>
<p>This is fundamentally how our immune systems work.  Consult a bio textbook, this is basic stuff.  Immunities are not just to the exact disease you encountered, but to other similar diseases.  Breadth of exposure is valuable.</p>
<p>Seriously, go do research.  Don't come back until you have.</p>

        <p>How do you propose that people acquire these t-cells/antibodies/immunity towards SARS-COV-2 at this point?</p>
<p>We can’t all go into the office and schools and lick doorknobs because SARS-COV-2 is circulating.  It’s going to infect millions and kill hundreds of thousands people before they’ve even had a chance to build immunity via existing coronavirus that happen to allow our bodies to build partial immunity. (Hint, that’s exactly what happened.). </p>
<p>Everything you’re talking about is potential data/research that supports future vaccines and treatments.  We have existing vaccines that work.  The point is for as many people as possible to not get infected with SARS-cov-2 so they can get vaccinated.  After which, we can go back to normal and people can let their immune systems handle colds again.</p>

        <p>I mean, it works in red states. Healthy people go out, get exposed to sc2 or similar, and rapidly decrease transmission paths that rely on the most socially connected people in society, the 18-35s, give or take. This decreases spread very quickly and the vulnerable are less likely to encounter the disease. All that neanderthal thinking in texas turns out to be a lot smarter than fauci and biden and the cdc! </p>
<p>The point is actually to let natural immunity work because for nearly everyone it is safer, produces a more robust immunity, and can be deployed much more quickly!</p>

<p>1st Graph -- 2020 deaths still track above all other years regardless of age.  And it trends upwards in December/January.  </p>
<p>You're wrong about suicides.  They didn't go up.</p>

<p>"If the virus was still around, the elderly people would still be dying. The virus is gone. "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The virus is still around.  More people died through the end of 2020 than was expected.  You can't cherry pick/filter data to tell a fictional story.  </p>
<p>You're claiming young people not dying = them not getting infected.  Which is false.  We all know younger people are less likely to die -- the fatality rate of the virus is heavily skewed towards the elderly.  It does not mean younger people aren't getting sick or suffering lingering health effects after they recover. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You're going off the rails with PCR test conspiracy and claims that medical professionals are counting existing flu/diseases as covid deaths.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778361">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778361</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Deaths in 2020 were higher by 20% than what we would have expected.  Something went around the population and killed 500,000+ people in 2020.  (Hint:  It was Covid 19).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Deborah Leah Birx is an American physician and diplomat who served as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator under President Donald Trump from 2020 to 2021<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She's on video stating this. You can't disprove this.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That is not accurate reporting of covid deaths. And if you think that it is, just end this conversation now because we have nothing more to say to each other.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yes. If one in the hospital and they test positive and subsequently die - that should absolutely be counted as a covid death.  It would get counted as a flu death any other year.  It's really not that complicated.  Birx and Ezike are right.  </p>
<p>And if you dispute positive test + dead patient = covid death, you're the one denying reality and deliberately trying to undercount/downplay this pandemic.  Idk about you man, but I'm gonna leave it to the doctors who are treating these patients and filling out death certificates.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The New York Times: PCR is giving 90% false positives.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">Source</a></p>
<p>Nowhere does it say that the PCR test is giving a false positive.  The entire article is discussing the viral load in a given sample, how many rounds of testing it takes to determine a positive test, etc...  It does not mean the PCR test is taking a sample with 0 Sars-Cov-2 and turning into a positive test because someone set it to 40 cycles.  If anything, the article talks about the limitation on the data we have.  It doesn't mean we shouldn't continue to test.  We should still be testing where appropriate while wanting data on how many rounds, viral load in the sample, etc...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And the CDC is inflating Covid deaths by up to 1,600% based on this study:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://medicalkidnap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CDC-Illegal-COVID-Deaths.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I can find plenty of sources shredding this "study".  Its' bunk.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In summary:  </p>
<ol>
<li>You failed to establish herd immunity was established in May.  Deaths in the US exceeded projections by 500,000.  Canada continued to see a higher death rate in your graph throughout the year and into the winter of 2020/21.  People were still dying and herd immunity clearly was not established. </li>
<li>Everything related to your PCR comments and below was a poor attempt at Gish Galloping.  I only replied because I was bored.  Next time, focus on the actual argument and present evidence that supports what you said.  False claims about leading causes of death in Bolivia doesn't help your argument.  (It was heart disease in 2017 -- not influenza <a href="https://causesofdeathin.com/causes-of-death-in-bolivia/2">https://causesofdeathin.com/causes-of-death-in-bolivia/2</a> )</li>

<p>Really?  We had multiple kids kill themselves over isolation.  There was even an 11 year old who shot himself in the head right in the middle of his Zoom classroom.  The classmates of this 11 year old had to watch him shoot himself in the head.  CBS will never tell you about that though.   CBS would never ever cover something like that.</p>

<p>The calls to suicide hotlines in Indianapolis increased by 1,000% - The calls themselves increased by 880% and texts to the hotline increased by a thousand%.</p>

<p>Calls to Los Angeles Suicide hotline increased by 8,000%.</p>
<p>Do you ever get tired of being wrong?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The virus is still around.  More people died through the end of 2020 than was expected.  You can't cherry pick/filter data to tell a fictional story.</p>
<p>Cut a lot of what you said to remain within character limit.  That study does not in any way prove covid-19.  All it says is, "Covid caused the deaths.  We said so!  Believe us!"</p>
<p>Prove to me that PCR tests are spot on.  Compare them with lab cell cultures- oh wait... not one cell culture has ever been performed to diagnose covid-19 in any human being.  Not one.  Over 1,000,000 people have been called covid deaths yet not one cell culture was performed.  Not one.  They have done cell cultures for influenza, but for covid?  Nah, they said, "we don't need to prove anything!  Just believe us because we said so!"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Yes. If one in the hospital and they test positive and subsequently die - that should absolutely be counted as a covid death.  It would get counted as a flu death any other year.  It's really not that complicated.  Birx and Ezike are right.</p>
<p>Counted as a flu death any other year?  Do you hear yourself?  The flu didn't take some time off.  It didn't go on vacation.  I want to see proof that it's NOT the flu.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And if you dispute positive test + dead patient = covid death, you're the one denying reality and deliberately trying to undercount/downplay this pandemic.  Idk about you man, but I'm gonna leave it to the doctors who are treating these patients and filling out death certificates.</p>
<p>Prove it.  PCR test is over 90% false positives.  Ruled that way in court.  Reported on by the NYT.  Discounted by doctors.  Discredited by the very Nobel Winner who created the test.  It's not a diagnostic tool.  It's not why it was created.  It's not its function.  I'm not going to believe you over the guy who invented it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You still haven't proven that the PCR test is 100% accurate.  You haven't proven that the flu took a vacation.  You haven't proven that covid deaths weren't something else entirely.  No one has.</p>

        <p>I’m not disputing the chart.  I’m saying your interpretation is flat out wrong.  The chart literally has the line for 2020 deaths trending towards the top and well above the lines for deaths every other year.  Your own chart literally shows more people died in 2020 than the last years by a significant margin. </p>
<p>K.  1 news story doesn’t disprove stats.  Suicides went down in 2020.  That’s an established fact.  The “suicides increased in 2020” narrative has been flat out debunked.  </p>
<p>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.axios.com/suicide-decreased-in-2020-pandemmic-mental-health-26196eaf-a245-4d21-85eb-eeb864a24449.html</p>
<p>You can’t shift the goalposts.  You said suicides went up.  I said they didn’t and they actually went down.  We’re not talking about hotlines and support data, we’re talking about the raw #’s of suicides and they went down.  </p>
<p>Well.  We counted 400-500k covid deaths in 2020.  Deaths were higher in 2020 by over 500,000 deaths.  It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that 500,000 people dying of a novel virus that wasn’t expected increased the 2020 death toll.  </p>
<p>You have a better hypothesis for why deaths increased by 500,000 over what was expected in 2020?</p>

<p>I don’t have to prove covid deaths are real.  We have tests along with doctors and medical literally filling out 586,000 death certificates.  That’s the proof.  </p>
<p>It’s not the normal flu.  The existing flu strains don’t sicken and kill 586,000 over the course of a year and some change.  Existing vaccines and social distancing definitely dampened the impact of the flu this year. </p>

        <p>If covid was so dangerous, that peak would have been a slope.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that.  That peak shot way up and then fell all the way back down.  That virus is gone now.  The fact that the line was higher is VERY likely to do with the fact that elderly patients are being forced to stay out of hospitals when they need to get medical screening.  There have been studies proving that's the case and even the hospital where I work is doing that very thing.  It's causing deaths out of fear of covid.  </p>
<p>Old people need constant medical screening.  If they test positive, they have to stay home until their condition gets critical and by then, it's too late to save them.  That's basic medicine.  That's how shit works.  </p>
<p>Is being afraid of covid sexual for you?  Is that why you're terrified?  Is that why you don't want to learn anything other than what CNN tells you?  That you'll die if you don't behave?  I'm just trying to understand why you're avoiding the evidence presented.  You must be a serious sheep.</p>
<p>And why are you STILL trying to push this "suicides went down" narrative?  Calls to hotlines are directly related to actual suicides.  You do not get an 8,000 increase in calls without seeing a significant increase in actual suicides.  What the fuck is wrong with you?</p>
<p>Yes, I said suicides go up.  There's a correlation between calls, attempts, and successes.  </p>
<p>" We counted 400-500k covid deaths in 2020. Deaths were higher in 2020 by over 500,000 deaths"</p>
<p>We?  You were part of that count?  Show me the data.  Show me the exact data YOU yourself used to get that number.  I want to see the tests performed and criteria for determining the direct causes of death that was covid.  If someone died in a car crash and it was declared a covid death (which happened), I want to know exactly how covid caused the car to veer off the road and end in a fatal injury.  Provide me that info.  You said you were part of the count.  The data you used should be easy to provide.</p>
<p>" You have a better hypothesis for why deaths increased by 500,000 over what was expected in 2020? "</p>
<p>According to the CDC, it was only  377,883.  I guess they didn't get all the data you say you used when you counted the deaths.</p>
<p>And the CDC stresses that covid being a CONTRIBUTING cause is in that number too.  That number in no way just includes those DIRECTLY killed by covid- it's just everyone who happened to die with a positive PCR test.  Even if the person was struck by lightning while driving the car during a heart-attack the very same instant a meteor slammed into the vehicle.  If that person got a positive PCR test, he or she would be included in that count.  That is what that means- and again- the CDC flat out states a different number than the one you gave me.  You have FAILED.</p>
<p>You can't tell me that 400,000 to 500,000 people were directly killed by covid when the CDC states that  377,883 was the number of everyone who died because of it AND who died with even the slightest suspicion of covid.  </p>
<p>"I don’t have to prove covid deaths are real. We have tests along with doctors and medical literally filling out 586,000 death certificates. That’s the proof."</p>
<p>Uhh yeah you do.  You do have to prove it.</p>
<p>I could write "Analy probed by aliens" on a death certificate, but that doesn't make it true.  I'd need proof.  The only proof is a test that's been proven to not work.  The PCR test is broken.  It's busted.  It's useless.  It's garbage.  It is NOT PROOF.</p>
<p>And the PCR test is NOT proof of a virus unless it's used in conjunction with other methods as well as only run at a maximum of 20 cycles.  Every hospital around the planet has been running at 40 - 60.  That's been admitted and proven.  Even Fauci admitted to that.  Even the FDA admits to it.  They even updated the user manual for it in November to order 40.  It did NOT state 40 cycles BEFORE the update.  I know- I read the original user manual for the test.  The FDA updated it to be run at 40 cycles which the CREATOR of the test said is absolute bullshit.  Do you get off on being wrong or is it just a natural talent of yours?</p>

        <p>You’re just flat out ignoring that cases and deaths rose again in the fall/winter.  </p>
<p>You work at a hospital?  I don’t believe you.  4-8 of graduate and post graduate medical training was wasted if that’s the case. </p>
<p>You keep saying the virus is gone.  But people kept getting infected and dying. Anyone with 2 brain cells that worked close to a Covid unit would realize the virus was very much still around. </p>
<p>Yes, people avoiding hospitals and treatment leads to to negative health outcomes.  That’s literally one of the reasons why this pandemic sucks and letting this virus spread through the entire population for a year is so awful.  </p>
<p>Older people test positive for covid and they die?  Yeah, covid tends to do that. It’s a shitty virus.  </p>
<p>I’m not a sheep.  No more than you are for believing false information and misrepresenting CDC data to fit your narrative while simultaneously ignoring the rest of the data that tells you covid has killed 586,000 Americans between 2020-21.</p>
<p>It’s not a narrative.  Suicides went down.  I linked you with the raw numbers.  Cope. </p>
<p>Yeah. It’s around 378,000 covid deaths between March-Dec per the CDC.  Its closer to 500k if you do March-March.  I’ve gone back and forth depending on the debate and time frame I’m using.  It’s an honest mistake.  378k, 400k, 450k, etc... it really doesn’t matter.  The point is a lot of Americans died in 2020 from Covid and it was completely unnecessary and it’s honestly disgusting that you’re denying how they died. </p>
<p>Yeah.  Covid contributed to those deaths.  Aka, they wouldn’t have died if it wasn’t for covid and covid played a role in their deaths.  Covid exacterbated their underlying conditions or created conditions in the body that causes the person to die. </p>
<p>We didn’t have 378,000 overweight diabetic elderly people all of a sudden drop dead.  Covid devastated those people and caused them to die. </p>
<p>PCR tests are perfectly fine. I’m gonna go with a public university’s understanding of what the PCR test can and can’t be used for over yours.  </p>
<p>https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/covid-19-critical-thinking/covid-19-pcr-test-reliable-despite-commotion-about-ct-values</p>
<p>It’s already been proven.  Between PCR testing, cell cultures, 586,000 independent death certificates.  The proof is any PCR testing along with the medical doctor’s decades of experience between training and on the job experience.  We’ve identified the virus.  We’ve confirmed it exists.  We’ve tested people who have it and who died.  </p>
<p>When I say we. I don’t mean me.  I mean we as a society.  Doctors, nurses, lab workers, government workers. Everyone in society that has been dealing with this pandemic since day 1. </p>
<p>You can scream and screech.  The medical community considers it to be effective enough at detecting the existence of sars-cov-2.  I’ve provided plenty of research and articles that support the use of PCR testing in the detection of viruses and pathogens.  </p>
<p>20 has never been the “max” as you put it.  Thermofisher puts 25-35 cycles as an average. </p>

<p>I'm not ignoring the cases and deaths.  I've already told you that PCR cases don't mean shit.  How many more times do I need to say it before YOU stop ignoring it.  You're the one ignoring things, not me.  I've told you 4 times that "cases" mean nothing, yet you keep insisting that they do.  Why is that?  Tell me.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You work at a hospital?  I don’t believe you.  4-8 of graduate and post graduate medical training was wasted if that’s the case.</p>
<p>I never said I'm a medical student.  I didn't say I had medical training.  Not once.  You just assumed that.  I am a Biomedical Electronics Tech.  I maintain and repair the medical devices in this hospital.  It means I have the run of every single department here.  I see what's going on in the whole hospital.  I see the "covid" patients and the standard patients.  I see it all.  Outpatient, ER, ICU, Med/Surg, Surgery- all departments.  But I never said I am a med student.  That was your assumption.   </p>

<p>&rt;You keep saying the virus is gone.  But people kept getting infected and dying. Anyone with 2 brain cells that worked close to a Covid unit would realize the virus was very much still around.</p>

<p>&rt;Yes, people avoiding hospitals and treatment leads to to negative health outcomes.  That’s literally one of the reasons why this pandemic sucks and letting this virus spread through the entire population for a year is so awful.</p>
<p>Avoiding?  No, I said FORCED to avoid.  I said TURNED AWAY from hospitals.  I said TREATMENT DENIED.  Don't put words in my mouth.  You know what I'm saying.  Stop ignoring it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Older people test positive for covid and they die?  Yeah, covid tends to do that. It’s a shitty virus.</p>
<p>No.  PCR tests do not equal terrible illness.  Almost all of covid cases are PCR results on people who don't have covid.  If you are dying of cancer and try to get treatment, but have to get a covid test to see if you have covid, you are not a covid patient.  That getting PCR test shit is bullshit.  If someone has to be told to go drive up to a testing site to get tested then that person does not have covid.  </p>
<p>This "deadly virus" is so deadly that you have to get tested just to know you have it.  That's how deadly it is.  It could be completely fucking ignored.  It's so deadly I didn't even notice it.  Sounds like the most pathetic killer virus in recorded history!   If the absolute worst thing covid can do to me is give me a positive PCR test then I'm not going to fucking worry about it.  This virus is absolutely worthless as a killer virus.  It's a complete joke!   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I’m not a sheep.  No more than you are for believing false information and misrepresenting CDC data</p>
<p>Oh I'm misrepresenting the CDC data?  I copied it right from their own site.  They typed that.  I didn't.  THEY gave that figure and wrote in exactly what that figure means.  YOU are the one crying about it because it doesn't match what YOU want it to match. Are you really that hurt over it?  That's not my problem.  I don't care enough about you to hold your hand because you're upset.  Your mother should do that for you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;It’s not a narrative.  Suicides went down.  I linked you with the raw numbers.  Cope.</p>
<p>You linked garbage sites.   Neither of those sites are credible. The CDC does NOT have valid suicide data yet:</p>
<p>"What I have seen recently, I have never seen before," Hansen said. "I have never seen so much intentional injury,” said a nurse from the same hospital. </p>
<p><strong>And while</strong> <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/06/covid-suicide"><strong>health authorities</strong></a> <strong>will not have verified data regarding suicides and drug overdoses in 2020 for two more years, local reporting indicates that suicide fatalities have increased year-on-year.</strong></p>

<p>Cope.  You won't have proof of numbers for 1 to 2 more years.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Yeah. It’s around 378,000 covid deaths between March-Dec per the CDC.  Its closer to 500k if you do March-March.  </p>
<p>No.  You still need to prove to me that all of them died as a direct result of covid.  You need to stop accusing me of ignoring things.  You keep ignoring that statement.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Yeah.  Covid contributed to those deaths.  Aka, they wouldn’t have died if it wasn’t for covid </p>
<p>Prove it.  Prove to me that the guy who died in Florida in a motorcycle accident was directly caused by covid.  Prove it.  The courts couldn't prove it.  The courts forced the state to remove his name from the covid count.  No proof exists anywhere of covid being the cause of death of all those people.  None.  There is proof of dying with a positive PCR test even though they died of clear other causes.</p>
<p>Covid PCR tests do not equal covid deaths.  Only people like you believe that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;We didn’t have 378,000 overweight diabetic elderly people all of a sudden drop dead.  Covid devastated those people and caused them to die.</p>
<p>Oh you forgot about a hundred other causes of death as well.  Count them all.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;PCR tests are perfectly fine. I’m gonna go with a public university’s understanding of what the PCR test can and can’t be used for over yours.</p>
<p>That's because you want nothing more than to be a scared little sheep.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/covid-19-critical-thinking/covid-19-pcr-test-reliable-despite-commotion-about-ct-values<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It’s already been proven.  Between PCR testing, cell cultures, </p>
<p>Not one cell culture has been done for covid-19.  Not one.  You're once again telling absolute lies.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;When I say we. I don’t mean me.  I mean we as a society.  Doctors, nurses, lab workers, government workers. Everyone in society that has been dealing with this pandemic since day 1.</p>
<p>And yet plenty of doctors and nurses and scientists are quoted on this subreddit almost every single day stating that covid is long gone.  It's perfectly treatable.  It's not overly deadly.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You can scream and screech.  The medical community considers it to be effective enough at detecting the existence of sars-cov-2.  I’ve provided plenty of research and articles that support the use of PCR testing in the detection of viruses and pathogens.</p>
<p>And yet you're wrong again.  The medical community has been TOLD to say that.  You see, I talk to doctors and nurses every single day.  Mostly nurses.  I deal with vendors from medical companies and technicians who travel from hospital to hospital.  The majority of them don't agree with you.  They agree with me.  They're just following orders from the state.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;20 has never been the “max” as you put it.  Thermofisher puts 25-35 cycles as an average.</p>
<p>Oh so you agree that 40-50 is way too high...  You agree that 40-50 gives trash results.  Thank you!  Some honestly finally.  Every hospital in America was running up to 40.  The UK was doing 48.  Other countries were doing 50.</p>

        <p>Herd immunity has been an effective strategy for some millions of years.  Source: those same biology textbooks you're still ignoring. Seriously, if you can't understand some of the basic principles here, or be bothered to look in to them, I'm done with you. Bye!</p>

        <p>You’re refusing to acknowledge that herd immunity can be and has been accomplished through vaccination.  </p>
<p>You’re refusing to realize that people would rather not get sick.  Especially if the disease is serious.  Novel flu strains, SARS-Cov-2, herpes, HIV, chicken pox, small pox, etc...  We have use science, vaccines, and spread mitigation methods to eradicate smallpox and make diseases like polio and measles almost irrelevant. </p>
<p>Herd immunity is not a strategy and it never has been.   People survived in spite of small pox and novel flu strains.  When we achieve herd immunity, it will be because of the vaccines.  Not because we let people get sick and die.</p>

        <p>But let’s get back to the original beef I had with your comment which you never refuted.  Social distancing DOES NOT mean your body forgets how to protect itself against viruses it has already been exposed to — whether by infection or vaccination.</p>

        <p>It’s when they say they do it for others that infuriates me. I read a post the other day. A family sold their house to buy a bigger house. Six of the family members then died in a car wreck. A family member working overseas made her way home. Turned up at their old home asking to see it one last time. Masker was the new owner. Got mad she showed up without a mask. Turned her down. Got on here to ask what to do, apparently this traumatized woman in shock was friends with former neighbors and sitting on their front porch looking at the house. Maskers wife was creeped out. Said covid so no, the woman can’t come in. </p>
<p>Many of the responses were Team Mask sucks to be her but thankfully common sense came to the rescue and told him what a heartless pos he was.</p>
