        <p>Getting the vaccine should be a choice. Not mandatory. Vaccine passport and exclusion from activities because of you don't get vaccinated aren't freedom.</p>
<p>The disadvantages may outweigh the benefits more for young and healthy people who aren't healthcare workers. It's mostly elderly who are vulnerable for the virus, not young and healthy people.</p>
<p>Elderly, chronically ill and healthcare workers could benefits from a vaccine, if they invent one that works and have no side effects. Elderly and ill because of they're more vulnerable for COVID19 and the flu than the majority, and healthcare workers so they don't infect their old and ill patients. So far they're unsure if the vaccinated ones can infect others with COVID19, but claims the vaccine will reduce the severity of the symptoms. The vaccines have new technology that hasn't been tested before and been made on 1 year. Vaccines normally takes 5-10 years to make and test.</p>

        <p>I love how this very important coronavirus related story is locked behind a paywall. This is a huge part of how they control the narrative. Any fearmongering story is free, of course.</p>

        <p>Nothing is a coincidence anymore. It's spreading fear everywhere. Humans have become so afraid of death because of the modernization of society, new technology, higher expected living spans and more wealth. We're not only used to be dependent on electricity, internet, plumbing and such, but also doctors saving us with new technologies. A lot that wasn't possible pre antibiotics, anesthetics and chemotherapy times.</p>
<p>That means modern humans have a much bigger urge to control death now than people in the past and in the poorest countries. That's the reason why lockdown and restrictions are possible.</p>
