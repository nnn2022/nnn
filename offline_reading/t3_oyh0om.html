        <p>It was isolated in America, though.</p>
<p>I’m all for being anti-medical apartheid and pro-freedom, but to say a virus doesn’t exist because it wasn’t isolated in a particular country’s labs is extremely illogical.</p>
<p>EDIT: Holy cow people downvoting everything I say, this is why people think everyone on this sub is stupid. Yes, the government and media are lying to us and trying to enact draconian measures in their favor. No, the vaccines are not as safe as they claim. No, you shouldn’t be forced to take them. </p>
<p>But do you really think the government would make up a virus with a 99.5%+ survival rate to control you? If they wanted to fake it, they’d come up with a deadlier rate. They wouldn’t be fighting with China over the origin of the virus. And they wouldn’t be censoring opinions from scientists who have studied the virus and vaccine and advising not to take the vaccine.</p>

        <p>That's super great news! Can you link that study? Because a large chunk of Canada just dropped all restrictions because their health department can't show that it's been isolated.</p>
<p>I'm sure the Canadian government would love to see this proof you have!</p>

        <p>It’s apparently available for research for some (not all) members of the medical community. That’s one reason the PCR tests are completely flawed - while some medical researchers had access to the isolated samples in the US, the developers of the PCR tests were not.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/grows-virus-cell-culture.html</p>
<p>How large is this chunk of Canada? </p>
<p>And if the virus doesn’t exist, then what do you make of all the studies by doctors opposing the vaccine concerning the nature and structure of the spike proteins in COVID-19?</p>

        <p>The CDC isn’t a thing promoting a virus, it’s the American government agency responsible for the study of infectious diseases; however corrupt, it is infinitely more reliable than a blog claiming that because one country doesn’t have a virus in isolation, the virus doesn’t exist. It’s the rest of the government that is aiming for draconian policies and influencing the CDC.</p>
<p>There’s an abundance of sources indicating the virus has been isolated by scientists in multiple countries. It’s genome has been sequenced; you can look at it yourself. There are even pictures. </p>

<p>Moreover, we have writings and studies from doctors claiming the mRNA vaccine is hazardous and should not be taken that are being censored by the government. They have studied the virus and the vaccine and come out against the vaccine.</p>

        <p>It’s a government agency. That’s not a mutually exclusive designation from propaganda machine. I’ve also sourced you links from scientists outside the CDC and the US. You can also just look up (not on Google) studies from scientists who believe the vaccines are more harmful than the virus - they don’t pretend the virus doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Plus, the criterion of embarrassment: if the virus doesn’t exist, why would government agencies release data showing it kills less than a single percent of those effected? If you were inventing a virus <em>ex nihilo</em>, wouldn’t you claim it was much, much deadlier?</p>

        <p>Government Agencies engages in disinformation.... look into the Smith-Mundt Act of 2012.....  </p>
<p>I do not care about doctors/scientists that are being paraded on MSM saying "THE VIRUS IS REAL" news flash... It isn't.... It's the fucking flu always has been...  </p>
<p>Just look at the flu/cold numbers for 2020... They are nonexistent... and do not fucking tell me it's because of isolation and mask wearing... That's a fucking lie.... Masks never stopped viruses ever...  </p>
<p>I look for people who were being censored and they tell a completely different story... and they get no attention because they go against the AGENDA... THE NARRATIVE... So no i do not believe anything the government tells me... ZERO.</p>

        <p>Dude, if you exclude every source you don’t like, of course you’re going to arrive at the conclusion you made before looking at any sources. I gave you sources from the government and scientists outside the government promoting the vaccine. </p>
<p>I also referred to scientists outside the government who are <em>against</em> the vaccine and the government agenda - <em>who are being censored by the government themselves.</em></p>
<p>Yes, the government is lying and conflating flu and COVID-19 numbers. But that doesn’t mean COVID-19 doesn’t exist. It means don’t trust everything the government or the media tell you.</p>
<p>Again, why fake a 99.5% recovery rate?</p>

        <p>But when you click the link to the research paper they provide and then go to the methods section it says they took a nasal swab and then ran a PCR test on it. That is not lege artis, "adhering to the standards of the profession" as they did not isolate it like all other viruses have been before.</p>
<p>edit: let me amend that it is not unusual to use PCR in such a situation, but it is unusual to rely on it as the only means, as it normally is just one tool among many to prove the virus' qualities.</p>
