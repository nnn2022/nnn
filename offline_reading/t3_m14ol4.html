    <strong>No, we're NOT in this together.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't give a fuck about the virus. We've had enough scientific evidence for ALMOST A YEAR NOW to point out that for the average healthy person under the age of 70, this pussy ass virus is NOT a big deal.</p>
<p>I refuse to drastically alter my entire lifestyle to cater to your fear, or retarded "health experts" who apparently don't know a single goddamn thing about human nature/psychology, or the whims of increasingly authoritarian governments that put the CCP, Nazi Germany and Soviet Union to shame. The push to radically alter society and forcibly modify the social contract is NOT okay IN MY OPINION in any way shape or form and this is a hill I'm willing to die on.</p>
<p>I reject all of this bullshit because it leads to a society that's not worth living in. I'm not fucking afraid of other people. I don't need the government to "protect" me. If I get sick, so be it. Tough shit, who cares, that's life. That has been the default position for literally all of human history. If you give me a transmissible disease by being in my proximity that's my problem, I understand the risk and I take full responsibility of getting sick if I do. If you're afraid, don't be around other people. Order everything online and hunker down, you have the insane modern privilege to do so, so do it instead of trying to guilt trip other people for living NORMAL lives.</p>
<p>All of us are gonna die at some point anyway. But there are fates worse than death. Death is mandatory but suffering is optional and the governments and people trying to dictate others how to live their lives are creating massive amounts of suffering. It's clear now and has been for a while that lockdowns and mask mandates DO NOT create a better outcome. Some of the most draconian places have worse outcomes than places that are pretty much fully open. There is zero scientific evidence for them. They just don't work, period, end of discussion. They're nothing but a power grab by authoritarian psychopaths. But the economic and psychological consequences of this will be felt for generations to come and the best part is that NONE of it would have been necessary if we, as humanity, would've taken a rational approach.</p>
<p>If this was a truly deadly pandemic, we wouldn't even be having this discussion. People wouldn't even think twice about. We'd be hunkered in our homes and there wouldn't have to be this massive advertising campaign for what basically boils down to be a glorified seasonal influenza in terms of danger. If the authorities stopped the 24/7 fearmongering train nobody would have any idea that there was a pAnDeMiC going on. You wear your shitty ass masks that do jack and shit and think it's some magical talisman, suddenly it's okay to go around shopping to and be anywhere near people? Everyone subconsciously knows it's a bunch of fucking bullshit but they just do it because they're afraid of social shaming. That's it.</p>
<p>I take care of my own damn health and trust my immune system 100%. You are not responsible for my health and I'm not responsible for your health. I know myself and I can say with full confidence that I probably eat healthier than you and I probably AM healthier than you. If you wanna "fight the pandemic" get some exercise, hug your friends, stop eating literal toxic waste, drop some daily Vitamin D and Zinc and throw that TV to the garbage dump.</p>
<p>Newsflash to all the doomers: I don't give a single fuck about you. I don't care if you think I'm a bad person. We've never met in real life and even if we did, you have given zero fucks about me before all of this and you will give zero fucks about after all of this, so why should I give a damn about you? You're probably an asshole anyway. It's not common courtesy. Common courtesy is to mind your own fucking business and let me live my life as I see fit. If you don't like it, well, you can just suck my fucking cock.</p></p>

        <p>You have no idea how angry it made me when I'm seeing high-class public figures bashing others for not staying at home. Trust me if I lived in a mansion with 2 swimming pools I can get through a lockdown without many complaints either.        <br>
But even then a lot of them ended up becoming hypocrites as time went on and embarked on holidays, expecting the rest of us to "do our duty", its revolting.</p>

        <p>The tweet kind of reminds me when Malala blocked someone on Twitter for telling her to raise awareness about some Hindu girls murdered by some Muslim men in India. I'm Muslim and I know that what happened to the girls were wrong. Malala didn't need to block them. It seems off-topic, but both involves nominated for the Nobel-peace prize and also involves doing bad things in Twitter.</p>
<p>It's pretty sad that rich elites are trying to raise awareness for climate change in that sort of fashion. . I'm pretty sure most famous people have rich elites hidden behind them. Jake Paul has a marketing company behind him who helped him create Team 10. It's sad that people have to stoop this low to get the attention from people to stop climate change. </p>
<p>There are better ways to encourage people to help the climate rather than Greta's scolding. People should flat-out say the problems of climate change and why we need to fix it.</p>

        <p>The Black Death was actually good for medieval peasants in the long run. The peasants that survived were able to make higher wages because the labor was in such short supply. </p>

        <p>Staying at home is nice and all, but my husband and I have literally worked this entire pandemic. Not everyone has that privilege. He’s in public health (trust me literally everyone at his BoH is 10000% over this) and I worked in biomedical research. Most of our family has had jobs that either cannot be done remotely (literally these jobs have kept our society running) or have realized that they don’t need to be forcing their workers into the office every day to get the job done. That’s literally the only benefit I hope will stick after all this. Allowing remote jobs to stay remote/let people who would rather work from home do so.</p>

        <p>Yeah, not to mention how creepy it is to label some people 'essential' and others 'non essential.' My mind starts to think of where that could do. All of this has been about fear, destroy, harm, divide and conquer. A truly evil, psychopathic agenda that must fail and soon.</p>

        <p>I’m no longer at that biomedical research job but they had us come in and just assumed all of us weren’t going anywhere besides work and the store (10000% not true) I was like... okay if this is so deadly/contagious if one person at my job got covid we all would’ve gotten it considering how closely my team worked together. This same job approved my vacation back in November when I got married and KNEW I went out of state for my honeymoon and didn’t make me quarantine before I came back but then turned around and scared the couple coworkers I invited into not attending. 🙃</p>

        <p>The irony here is that anti maskers and anti restriction types are those positions because they can't afford to hunker down, but yet those same people are also anti workers rights and anti social safety net, etc. </p>
<p>So rather than make the corporate class pay better and provide better benefits, they get mad at everyone else and prefer to risk getting themselves and others sick. </p>
<p>How does that make any sense?</p>
<p>I feel for you if you're suffering, but the problem isn't the public health efforts. It's the shit economic paradigm that makes you pay for things the corporate class should be paying for.</p>

        <p>It’s so sad that a pandemic was used to push a greater divide between left and right. BOTH sides are just pointing fingers at the other when in reality, the true cause was our corrupt politicians. If you think corruption is just on the opposing party’s side, you’re part of the problem. Democratic and Republican politicians/leaders are liars and have been bowing down to the wealthy individuals and/or leaders who donate most to them.</p>

        <p>I mean, I guess you can tell yourself that, but there are lots of politicians from across the spectrum that agree on what we should do and what makes sense for the country and a lot of it would help regular people. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there is one group from one party that decided to make what is very clearly a health issue a political issue instead. And now that group and party is refusing to cosign support for people.</p>

<p>I don't expect politicians to be benevolent. I expect them, like everyone else, to have opinions and world views of what the best course of action is in complicated situations. And just like the rest of us, some of them are morons and some of them are not. And they're all going to be wrong at times.

        <p>You're demonstrating exactly what is so stupid about the pro-lockdown side.  It isn't about public health to you, so much as it's about politics.  You just assume that anyone who is against the lockdown is a conservative, and from that I can infer that you most likely support lockdowns because it's the "left wing" thing to do.</p>

<p>I fail to see how you reached that conclusion. </p>
<p>&rt;You just assume that anyone who is against the lockdown is a conservative, and from that I can infer that you most likely support lockdowns because it's the "left wing" thing to do.</p>
<p>You'd be wrong. </p>
<p>I'm actually not "pro-lockdown". But I'm also not a moron. So I understand that wearing a mask, distancing, and avoiding crowded places is the best option. Even if their weren't "lockdowns" I would not be frequenting restaurants or movie theaters because they are exactly the types of places that I would catch Covid. </p>
<p>So from an economic perspective, it makes zero difference if there is a state ordered lockdown or not. And as a result we still need policy to help the people and businesses that would suffer. </p>
<p>I don't imagine you've put enough thought into this to understand that though.</p>

<p>You'd be right, in that people would vote with their feet even if lockdowns were not in place, but I (with many others in this group I think) are just as much against the constant alarmist fear mongering campaign by health experts as we are the actual government interventions.  I for one, am actually angrier about the fear mongering than the actual lockdown restrictions.  The economy, and many people's lives, will be ruined not by the politicians and their restrictions, but by health experts and their fear mongering, which will prevent life ever returning to normal even if every last restriction is lifted.</p>

<p>I don't see fear-mongering. I also have zero concern about people getting back to normal when this is over. Too many stupid people didn't change anything when they should have. They're certainly not going to change when things are better. And the rest of us that do follow the guidance certainly would enjoy doing many of the things we used to do. It is a very few and far between individual that prefers the current paradigm over anything more social.</p>

<p>There is so far MINIMAL evidence that the "long-term effects" are anything but completely overblown.

<p>🤣 so all of the constant PSAs pushing the narrative that this thing is an apocalyptic killer, the overemphasis on case numbers without reference to death numbers or hospitalizations or context regarding age and health status, and the purposeful cherry picking of rare examples of young people dying isn't fear-mongering?

<p>You do you. I see things like <a href="https://celticswire.usatoday.com/2021/02/16/nba-boston-celtics-tatum-covid-effects-linger/">NBA athletes saying they have long term effects</a> and <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/what-does-covid-do-to-your-blood">the potential for blood disorders</a> and think to myself it's simply not worth it. All I have to do is avoid people for a bit longer and I'll get the vaccine and be much more confident that it's not going to do something unexpected. People used to think smoking was fine. We learn all sorts of things over time. </p>

<p>I literally don't know what you're talking about. No one talks about it like it's an apocalyptic killer. It's like <em>you're</em> stuck in 2020. But there simply isn't a reason to risk it. When the solution is so simple, why put yourself at risk? I don't hang out with smokers either, for the record.</p>
<p>&rt;So you're contradicting yourself. Did people vote with their feet or did they not? Is it the lockdowns or people's fear of the virus that will destroy the economy? Stay consistent here.</p>
<p>How am I contradicting myself? There are lots of people that did what they're supposed to. There are also lots of people that didn't change anything. The hospitality/entertainment industries are of very small margins. It doesn't take much to destabilize them. I have zero concern with enough people getting back to normal once we have a significant number of vaccinations that the economy will be fine. </p>
<p>I'd also point out that you can look at Sweden and Florida, neither of which locked down and have plenty of morons running around but there are still lots of people that did what the could to help the situation and their economies suffered.</p>

        <p>&rt;You do you. I see things like NBA athletes saying they have long term effects and the potential for blood disorders and think to myself it's simply not worth it.

We learn all sorts of things over time. </p>
<p>That's exactly my point.  A few examples of NBA players saying they have long-term effects doesn't indicate on any statistical level that this is somehow likely in any way.  It is literally just that, a few small anecdotes.  You can find a few anecdotal examples of people having long-term complications, including blood disorders.   from other diseases, it's not unique to covid.  But I'll bet you never took any notice of those few examples with any other disease, and probably took your chances.  Moreover, those few examples do little to prove that covid is indeed what caused their symptoms.  Not to mention, symptoms they're reporting are a pretty subjective thing.</p>
<p>&rt;I literally don't know what you're talking about. No one talks about it like it's an apocalyptic killer. It's like you're stuck in 2020.</p>
<p>Right.  Everyone seems to be stuck in March 2020, thinking that covid is a death sentence and that it also significantly effects the young and healthy.  This is due in part to the continued PSA in the media and on billboards highlighting rare examples of a young and healthy person who died.  It's also due to highlighting supposed long-term effects on the young and healthy, which are equally dishonest, as they are showing an extremely small number of cases first of all, and second are not showing in any type of clinical way that the long-term effects are even real or whether they're definitely connected to covid; yet here you are, convinced that you're taking a real chance on developing those complications if you're not cautious enough.</p>
<p>&rt; I have zero concern with enough people getting back to normal once we have a significant number of vaccinations that the economy will be fine. </p>
<p>And what do you base this on?  I'm in NYC, and if you saw the amount of closures here, of entire industries, I don't think you'd be so confident.  Moreover, there are the potential long-term effects of the lockdowns in terms of health problems that didn't get addressed and that we'll now have to all pay to treat when the problems becomeworse and more widespread, children who will be set behind in their education thus shrinking the potential skilled workforce.  I don't think we're yet even comprehending what the effects on the economy will be.</p>
<p>&rt;I'd also point out that you can look at Sweden and Florida, neither of which locked down and have plenty of morons running around but there are still lots of people that did what the could to help the situation and their economies suffered.</p>
<p>You're thinking short-term.  When we finally see the results of lockdown, I think you'll see what has really happened due to lockdown.  Not necessarily saying that Florida and Sweden will be spared, but their short-term troubles are not the economic damage that I'm talking about and that we have yet to see.</p>

<p>Exactly, we don't have much data, so it seems like you're the one who is speculating with very little data.  You seem convinced that there is a real risk of long-term complications, in fact a great enough risk to stop living your life.</p>
<p>And the reality is we do actually have good evidence that there is nothing to worry about when it comes to long-term effects.  The very fact that little data has been gathered, and that there are an infantesimally small number of examples of people with long-term effects, is a good indication that they aren't widespread.  If the evidence was really mounting for long-term complications, there would surely be more research on it already out of necessity, no?</p>

<p>I feel as though you aren't aware of the devastation caused by the Great Recession or Depression. Both were more widespread. The current recession is much more localized in the economy. And the causes are very specific as well. Once consumers get back on track, the segments will recover. As I mentioned before, there is already a lot of evidence of new businesses being created to fill the gaps left by failed businesses. </p>

<p>And this was considered living your life normally before 2020.  It's called being around other people.  You are now avoiding other people.  So unless you were a solitary introvert before, you have indeed stopped living your life.<br>
That even <em>sounds</em> very dystopian; you're literally saying you no longer interact with those outside of your friends and family.  What an odd, exclusive existence.</p>

<p>If long-term effects were really appearing to be more and more prevalent, I have a hard time believing that there wouldn't be more of an organized effort to study it.  By your logic, covid would've never been studied at all, because we lack the organized efforts to do so.  And yet we did; there is so much we DO know about covid.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you actually follow economic news or are you just going off your impression based off facebook and reddit's front page?</p>
<p>I'm going by what I see.  I've never seen so many closures all at once.  You may be right about it being less widespread than the Depression or the Recession, but I don't think we can even know yet tge economic effects.  It's funny that you're worried about long-term effects of covid, citing the reason that we don't know enough yet, but are confident already that the economy will come back.</p>

<p>What a weird thing to be upset about. I don't interact with strangers who provided zero value to my life. Again, "I doubt you even noticed before".</p>
<p>&rt;  By your logic, covid would've never been studied at all, because we lack the organized efforts to do so.</p>
<p>Proof is in the pudding. The Trump administration literally shut down programs to study coronaviruses and pandemic prep because they didn't think it was relevant. It's actually cited as one reason why we were behind the curve on detecting it. </p>
<p>Further, there was zero known until MONTHS into the spread because the US finally got involved at scale. And it took a lot of cash to do it. Even now, the understanding of variants is only from wealthy countries with the UK and US providing the majority of the samples. </p>
<p>Lastly, another great example is the development of Kawasaki-like illness among children. It's a known effect, but there is near zero research. </p>
<p>&rt;I'm going by what I see.</p>
<p>Your anecdotes are not data. </p>
<p>&rt;It's funny that you're worried about long-term effects of covid, citing the reason that we don't know enough yet, but are confident already that the economy will come back.</p>
<p>Because we know how modern economies work and recover. We don't know the long term effects of virulent coronaviruses. SARS and MERS were not as widespread as COVID-19 is.</p>

        <p>&rt;What a weird thing to be upset about. I don't interact with strangers who provided zero value to my life. Again, "I doubt you even noticed before".</p>
<p>Lol meeting new people is pointless, so you'd rather just isolate yourself from the world?  So because you gained no specific value from strangers, you choose to keep to yourself and those close to you?  That's abnormal because humans naturally interact with one another, and not just within their family unit.  You never went to bars or clubs or shows or events?  You never saw the value of meeting new people?  Of learning more, expanding your perspective and your social network?  It's not a weird thing to be upset about at all; what a weird thing to see avoiding human interaction as normal.  </p>
<p>&rt;Further, there was zero known until MONTHS into the spread because the US finally got involved at scale. And it took a lot of cash to do it. Even now, the understanding of variants is only from wealthy countries with the UK and US providing the majority of the samples. </p>
<p>This is simply not true.  We didn't know "zero" until months into the spread.  We knew almost <em>immediately</em> after the peak in NYC who this virus disproportionately affected, including which comorbidities were likely to put someone at risk.  Perhaps you and many others didn't follow any of this, but this information was well-known less than a month into the spread.<br>
Regarding the variants, this is not new information.  We have known for decades, actually close to a century, that coronaviruses mutate.  So actually, the existence of variants should not come as a surprise to anyone. </p>
<p>&rt;Lastly, another great example is the development of Kawasaki-like illness among children. It's a known effect, but there is near zero research. </p>
<p>Again with using small numbers anecdotes as concrete evidence or even proof I see.  The Kawasaki-like illness among children is not a "known" effect.  Not even close.  There were roughly 100 children in the entire state of NY that seemed to mysteriously contract this disease, and it was never definitively connected to covid; that was speculation that was never proven, and a sample size of 100 is not concrete data.  Moreover they hypothesized that there may have been confirmation bias involved, and that the usual number of children were getting it and it would've possibly gone unnoticed if not for covid.  Did you not notice how they just quietly, and rather abruptly, fizzled out any mention of it?  That's not because of lack of research, it's because they realized they were far from proving that it was indeed covid-related.</p>
<p>&rt;Your anecdotes are not data. </p>
<p>It's funny you say this, because so far you have insisted on the prevalence of long-term effects based on a few NBA players who have supposedly had symptoms after covid, and have declared that the Kawasaki-like illness is a "known" effect, based on a sample of 100 children with no proven connection to covid.  Neither of those things are data either.  So basically you've done nothing but cite anecdotes. </p>
<p>&rt;Because we know how modern economies work and recover. We don't know the long term effects of virulent coronaviruses. SARS and MERS were not as widespread as COVID-19 is.</p>
<p>We actually do know quite a bit about the effects of coronaviruses, we've known about them for nearly a century.  It is puzzling why everyone seems to be acting like we've never seen a coronavirus before and are immediately presuming that this one is somehow completely different.</p>

<p>That is how you meet new people.  They start out as strangers.</p>
<p>&rt;Isn't it odd that this got a lot of attention last spring but there still isn't a lot of research on it? </p>
<p>It's getting less attention now is because experts wanted it to quietly go away after realizing they jumped the gun and prematurely tried to connect it to covid.  The cases were so few and far between that it wasn't even possible to collect reliable data on it.  And as I've said, it was even hypothesized that possibly no more than the usual (pre-covid) amount of children were getting this illness and that it would've gone unnoticed if it weren't for covid.  In short, this is getting less attention because the experts realized that the evidence to covid was weak and that this was actually possibly a blunder that would reflect badly on and embarrass them, so they quietly phased out any mention of it.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if they had proved it was connected, 100 is an infantesimally small number in a state like NY.</p>
<p>&rt;Considering there is research on both, I'd say I am referring to the data. </p>
<p>Let's see this published research on both then, because so far most of the "research" I've seen on them has been speculative, and so far based on anecdotes, often from doctors.<br>
Besides, even if you can present some real research to me, that's not what you're referring to; you're referring to anecdotes, which is not data, even if real data exists somewhere.  So there may be real data, but you're not referring to it.  If you can connect your anecdotes about NBA players to real research instance, then I'll listen.</p>
<p>&rt;None of them have spread like covid-19.</p>
<p>Yes actually, the 4 coronaviruses that cause the common cold do spread like covid-19; we just don't consider that because the common cold is less potentially harmful than covid.<br>
Amd you mentioned lacking knowledge about the long-term effects of coronaviruses, not how they spread.</p>

<p>I mentioned virulent coronaviruses, like SARS, MERS, and Covid-19. The serious kinds are generally identified and stopped before the spread to this scale. Notably, they're have been shutdowns in the past two decades to get these under control as well.</p>

<p>&rt;https://www.ccjm.org/content/early/2020/12/30/ccjm.87a.ccc039</p>
<p>Did you actually read this study?  It openly acknowledges that it's unclear whether there is a connection between this illness/these cases and Covid-19.  And I distinctly remember you saying that it's a "known" cause.
Moreover, even an increase to 278 in the entire state of NY is hardly a cause for alarm statistically.  Do you gave any idea how rare that makes it.  My point stands, the experts quietly ceased any mention of this because they realized they were drawing premature conclusions and causing premature alarm.<br>
Also, the very existence of this study, along with the additional data mentioned in the study, indicates that there is indeed research being done on this, despite your assertion that there isn't. </p>
<p>&rt;https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3026</p>
<p>Again, while this is a well-written study, it is admittedly ambiguous, regarding what the symptoms are.  And although this may not have been your point, I will point out again that long-term effects are not unique to covid; yet with other viruses they barely get attention due to their rarity.  Yet you seem to think this is something novel.</p>
<p>&rt;Notably, they're have been shutdowns in the past two decades to get these under control as well.</p>
<p>Notably?  Where and when have shutdowns been used before for a virus except in China?</p>

<p>It's not about being starved for attention, it's about meeting new people, which is beneficial for expanding your network and your perspective.  You may have "plenty" of people in your life, but it is simply not normal (or even healthy, I'd argue) for humans to not interact with anyone outside their bubble.  It's called <em>living in a society</em>.
You clearly live a life of exclusivity.  </p>
<p>&rt;Re: Kawasaki, I never said it was a certainty nor that it was widespread. My point was always, why take the risk when not taking the risk is so easy? Even if it's 1/100. Would you take the risk of 1/100 giving your kid cancer?</p>
<p>Why take the risk for anything?  Why not walk everywhere because driving carries a risk of even greater than 1/100?  Why take the risk of sending my kid to school on a bus, on which there is a greater than 1/100 chance of a crash?<br>
And no, not taking the risk is not "easy".  Just because you may be content at home with your Xbox, it's not easy for others to not be able to work, for people to lose their businesses, for children to not go to school, and for the majority of people to be isolated from other humans, often including their friends and family.  We take greater risks than 1/100 every day, and we can't <em>cancel life</em> based on such a small risk.</p>
<p>&rt;I lose nothing by reducing my exposure to random people. And I effectively reduce my risk of ever developing anything.</p>
<p>Well yes you do, you lose your ability to interact with other humans as a <em>member of society</em>; humans naturally interact with other people.  Perhaps you're naturally an introvert or for some reason an outlier who craves less human contact, and there's nothing wrong with that, but socially speaking, avoiding contact with other people is not the most healthy thing socially.  </p>
<p>And regarding your risk of ever developing anything, the same principle can be applied as with social avoidance.  Your immune system relies on exposure to other people and germs.  By isolating yourself in a bubble, you are actually harming your immune system.  And eventually you will inevitably develop something even if you isolate yourself, unless of course you see <em>no one ever</em>.  And when this happens, your immune system will be unprepared.  </p>
<p>Finally, if that's your attitude toward risk, I'll mention the driving analogy again.  Just as you can reduce your risk of "ever developing anything" by avoiding other people, you can also reduce your risk of ever getting hurt ever by never going outside or traveling anywhere; after all, you could get in a car accident or be hit by a bus.</p>
<p>&rt;In the US. See May</p>
<p>Right, they closed schools for 14 days.  That's considerably different than closing schools, along with every other venue/industry/institution deemed "non-essential" for a year or indefinitely and telling everyone throughout society to stay home and avoid other people</p>

<p>I don't lead a remarkably secluded life. You're simply overdramatizing the lack of interaction by not talking to every random person at the grocery store. As noted, useful socialization can still happen without being in person with people. Most people that have a need for productive socialization have done so. </p>
<p>&rt;Why take the risk for anything?</p>
<p>The risks in day to day life are much smaller. Even the risk of a car accident is infinitesimal. You're overemphasizing the day to day risks of trivial actions and underestimating the impact of chronic illness. There is a reason health insurance is expensive and car insurance is not comparable.  </p>
<p>&rt;And no, not taking the risk is not "easy"</p>
<p>Of course it is. Wear a mask. </p>
<p>&rt;Well yes you do, you lose your ability to interact with other humans as a <em>member of society</em>; humans naturally interact with other people.</p>
<p>I've already addressed this. </p>
<p>&rt;By isolating yourself in a bubble, you are actually harming your immune system. </p>
<p>Again you're making up some weird paradigm for my life that I never expressed. </p>
<p>&rt;Right, they closed schools for 14 days.  That's considerably different than closing schools, along with every other venue/industry/institution deemed "non-essential" for a year or indefinitely and telling everyone throughout society to stay home and avoid other people</p>
<p>Because of two things: 1) less contagious disease and 2) people more willing to behave rationally. </p>
<p>To this day there are tons of people that flat out refuse to wear a mask and never have. I am not surprised at all the disease continues to spread. Low IQ action returns low IQ results.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, a strawman. Good argument. Nobody said anything about soda taxes, I said banning cigarettes and fast food in its current state, which would save far more lives than lockdowns ever could. </p>
<p>Deaths are only okay when it's due to something someone chose to do. Like choosing to go outside and risk getting the virus, right? Or is this not the criteria that you've set as to whether deaths should be used to play the empathy card? </p>
<p>What's the difference here? A death is a death, why is one really important, and the other doesn't matter?</p>

<p>As an anarcho-capitalist I just want to say that this is America and you have NO RIGHT to tell me what I can't do. That's what's called "Freedom of Choice"</p>

<p>"You asked what makes some deaths more important than others? Well.. welll.. what about if I shot my gun at my neighbor's yard. It's my risk to take right?" </p>
<p>I read through ancap reddits because their philosophy interests me, and they're not nearly as dense as what you're trying to pass off as a counterpoint. </p>
<p>If you can't answer my original point about what makes smoking deaths different from covid deaths in terms of how much they matter, I can't have a discussion with you, it would be largely unproductive for both of us. If you're not interested in hearing counter-arguments, just tell me now to save my time.</p>

<p>But I don't think they're different. Deadly consumer products that individuals choose to consume are morally the same as infectious agents that can spread on their own and kill other people. The government has NO RIGHT to say that covid positive people have to wear a mask or stay home.</p>
<p>That's science.</p>

<p>Yeah, but it was described to be such an incredibly low chance that I'm surprised it was even part of your argument as if you are acting like its a common thing. Do keep in mind we don't know much about the long-term effects of the virus either yet, you can't throw the word permanent with confidence either.          </p>

<p>I...I don't know what the hell this means. No idea how America itself relates to these, nor does it relate to the clear negative consequences lockdowns are having. I updated that bullet point as well to illustrate just a few of the many impacts lockdowns have had on people to give you an idea.</p>

        <p>I think we need to acknowledge the potential for permanent loss of smell so the libtards don't accuse us of downplaying the pandemic.</p>
<p>Besides, who cares if we all lose our sense of smell? Being able to smell things overrated anyways. The economy is more important.</p>

        <p>This is really stupid; if you yourself admit that it's unlikely for you to lose your smell, and then say "who cares if <em>we all</em> lose our sense of smell" it's pretty contradictory.        <br>
I've already illustrated it's not just the economy, but even then yes I think you do downplay the economy as well; it's what everyone relies on to make a living in this world, compared to a virus that you have a 99.9% survival chance.       <br>

        <p>Any plan that relies on 100% compliance from the entire population of planet earth and goes fundamentally against the social nature of the human being is so hilariously bad that it's not even funny. You could read literally Baby's First Psychology Book and realize that the plan is doomed to fail 😂 And we're supposed to trust these so-called experts. They're just a fucking joke at this point, and they will never have my trust back.</p>

        <p>How did colonialism or the Holocaust require 100% compliance? Even among EinsatzGruppen a fairly high degree of non-compliance was tolerated. Men were allowed to put in for transfers and if they didn’t feel like killing they didn’t have to. They could opt to unload trucks instead. </p>
<p>Colonialism was a forcible invasion of another country. Most people resisted it intensely. People generally did not want to be colonized. </p>
<p>The French Revolution did not require or expect 100% conformity. The French Revolution was successful despite the existence of monarchists and later, imperialists.</p>

        <p>What brought an end to the Holocaust wasn’t resistance, but invasion. The nazis and they people in their territory continued exacting the final solution until the very last moment. </p>
<p>Colonialism ended because it was no longer profitable. The British empire had faced resistance of far greater note for hundreds of years. What brought it down post war was the colonies (India, SA, etc.) was now far outstripping the profits and it was no longer worth it to deal with that resistance. Even still neither of these things required no resistance to occur. There was tons of resistance to colonialism and, depending on where we look, a fair degree of resistance to the Holocaust. Both happened regardless. Neither required 100% cooperation or anything near it. </p>
<p>I’m not suggesting everyone should accept these things, but their success was simply not predicated on a high degree of compliance.</p>

        <p>They bitch and whine over 92% complete compliance (and that compliance is asking a lot of them). </p>
<p>And the 100% compliance (that could only be achieved in a fantasy world) would still accomplish nothing since their arbitrary regulations don't have anything to do with globally eliminating a virus. So they would always be on a witch hunt for the one guy nullifying their magic incantations by checking his mail without a mask.</p>

<p>WHO (though liars, are often citated so I'll flip the tactics against the doomers) <a href="https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/constitution">defines health as:</a>  </p>
<p>"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."</p>
<p>So to protect your health, governments ban gyms and don't recommend or outright ban exercise, lock you in solitary confinement which is basically torture for the human mind, broadcasts literal fear porn 24/7, gaslights you with the preposterous lie that you're selfish for having human nees like touch and being in the physical presence of other humans, doesn't talk shit about diet etc.</p>
<p>Governments don't give a damn about us or public health. In fact, they actively hate and despise us.</p>

        <p>How about my boyfriend's dad, who died last week aged 51? He could easily have had another 30 years to live with his wife and kids. Instead, he was in a coma for 2 weeks while they were emotionally wrung out on the edge of hope and fear, and now he's gone and we go on without him.</p>

        <p>Think about how you reacted to this. I'm a stranger on the internet, but a real person, telling you about my boyfriend, also an actual person with feelings, someone extremely important to me, and his dad who died less than a week ago. I get that you might not like that I reminded you of this, but you chose to react by trying to trying to hurt me. What are your values, that you chose to react this way?</p>
<p>Also, masks are most important for reducing the spread <em>from</em> those infected. That's been the public messaging since around April of last year.</p>

        <p>I am telling people about a person who died of Covid-19, despite being younger than 70. A person who would not have died if the virus had been controlled where he lived, if there hadn't been a spike in infections around Christmas.</p>
<p>I am deliberately only talking about his age since that disproves the parent commenter's point, that the virus is not dangerous to those under 70. I am deliberately attempting to appeal to your humanity, our shared humanity, since many people in this thread are allowing their own negative emotions surrounding the pandemic restrictions to crowd out what, I hope, they would otherwise be feeling - sympathy, a fellow feeling towards one another.</p>
<p>If you read of a man's death, someone about whom you know <em>nothing</em> other than that he died of Covid-19 and had a family who loved him... and your first thought is to find some way to rationalize his death, to explain it away, to make it okay that he died decades before he would have had he not been exposed to the virus... then I think you should think very hard about why you have started to think that way.</p>

<p>&rt;What was his health like before the virus? Did he smoke? what was his BMI? did he already have diabetes or heart/lung issues?</p>
<p>These are simple questions that you should be able to answer, but you refuse to. It's because he didn't actually die of covid, he died because he was in poor health and made poor lifestyle choices.</p>

<p>&rt;'Journalism analysts argue that news media have caused widespread  compassion fatigue in society by saturating newspapers and news shows  with decontextualized images and stories of tragedy and suffering. This  has caused the public to become desensitized or resistant to helping  people who are suffering '</p>
<p>Nobody thinks that your boyfriend's father's life is worthless. I can guarantee you that. But some people don't like it when other people's deaths are used for the sole purpose of making them guilty. We're experiencing compassion fatigue because every day someone has been drilling into our heads that we are selfish and our life can be postponed for a year, two, or three, because if we go out we might accidentally kill a stranger's father or grandfather. We've been reduced to disease vectors. Everywhere we go we are reminded that all these deaths are somehow our fault, even if it's an 89 years old man with Alzheimer's who hasn't been outside since March last year. We're not even allowed to express anti-lockdown  opinions publicly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people have been extremely rude to me for expressing anti-lockdown views. A lot of us have had dark and suicidal thoughts in the past one year and every time we visit other subreddits we're met with mockery and hostility. Almost as if for people on your side our lives don't matter. Just last week I got this reply to something I wrote that wasn't one bit offensive, rude, conspirational or even directed at someone:</p>
<p>&rt;Oh good lord you’re a juicy one. I know who you are without ever having  met you. No job, you use the government for your living more than the  average person, you are in far right Fb groups but think you’ve somehow  stumbled on the “truth”, you think you are “woke” but really haven’t had  a day’s education in your life, you think everyone is out to get you  but really you’re just lost in society and an outcast. I can see you.  You will never amount to anything and I will be paying for your welfare  for the rest of your shit little life. But that’s a small price to pay  to ensure you never get above your station </p>
<p>So, no, we're not heartless. We just don't like being guilt tripped. And we don't like it when we're made to feel like shit in the one place where we're not supposed to feel like that.</p>

        <p>So we all have to have our lives utterly ruined, families and jobs destroyed and businesses immolated for this? That is what lockdowns wrought. Way more people will die from second order affects from the lockdowns in the years to come than ever have from this pandemic. Oh, and how do we know some anonymous Redditor isn't simply lying to further the authoritarian lockdown agenda?

        <p>That's what I'm guessing too. Few things get me going more than someone who tries to manipulate emotions in order to score fake internet points. I had an ex that pulled that shit when I was young and didn't know anything. I complied with her demands, despite knowing deep down that what she was doing was psychotic. I eventually broke up with her, got my dignity back and found someone who wasn't a complete cunt. I see these assholes trying the same thing here and I have to call it out.</p>

        <p>I'm not here for points, obviously, any comment I make is being downvoted.</p>
<p>The reason I am appealing to your emotions is that by looking for <em>reasons</em> that it <em>doesn't matter</em> that he died, you are in a very select group of people who come to believe that those who get sick don't deserve to live. Recognize that in yourself. I admit I'm trying to change your mind by telling you this personal story; sure, that's attempting to manipulate you. But I think it's awful that you could think this way, and I wish you were able to have sympathy.</p>
<p>He died in the ICU by the way, having never woken up from his coma - he died from Covid, no matter how much you may wish to hope that nobody under 70 really dies from Covid. You might not believe me, or you might delude yourself into almost not believing me, even though you know it's true. My boyfriend, his brother, and their mum are all devastated. That's true. And if your reaction to this death is to try to explain it away so you don't have to feel anything about it in your stubbornness, I think there is something wrong with you. But you should try to fix it, before you lose empathy completely.</p>

<p>I have no respect for anyone who would use the death of another, and claim to care so much about that person, in order to manipulate other people. It makes you a sociopath and you should be ashamed of yourself. Of course, you won't. You'll continue to double-down and continue this charade, like you have in other comments.</p>

        <p>&rt;How about my boyfriend's dad, who died last week aged 51? He could easily have had another 30 years to live with his wife and kids. Instead, he was in a coma for 2 weeks while they were emotionally wrung out on the edge of hope and fear, and now he's gone and we go on without him.</p>

        <p>Sounds insensitive but it’s true. Most people didn’t even try to improve their health through this plandemic. Viruses and bacteria are a part of life and that will never change. If someone wants to decrease their chances of getting sick, they have to improve their health. It’s that simple. You cannot blame anyone else for getting sick and dying.</p>

        <p>You can feign outrage all you like. The thing is we've known since the beginning that it's the comorbidities that make the virus dangerous. Vitamin D deficiency, diabetes, respiratory disease and <em>especially</em> obesity are the primary factors in covid deaths. So take some personal responsibility for your health and stop trying to bring society down around you to <em>attempt</em> to mitigate the poor choices of at risk people.</p>

        <p>Like the compassion you don't show for the hundreds of millions of people negatively effected by the lockdowns?  We will be feeling the impacts of the panic surrounding the virus for decades after it's gone. The absolutely massive transfer of wealth, rise of depression, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, suicide, drug overdose, missed  cancer screenings/ medical appointments,  poverty, child hunger, etc. Will be felt for decades and will kill far more than the virus ever would. So yes, if you're actually a compassionate person then take responsibility for yourself and stop trying to outsource it to the government.</p>

        <p>i can really imagine how it must seem that way when you can’t give less of a shit whether people live or die. It’s only an emotional appeal if you view “I don’t want people to die” as purely an emotional argument. I think it’s bad when people die. Do you?</p>
<p>I think you don’t. I think deep down you know how fucked up you are on the inside and I think the reason you want to believe that “I never cared about anyone living or dying before” is that you desperately want to believe that everyone else is like you. Well i’m not.  Get therapy or something dude, because you’re not normal.</p>

        <p>sorry dude i’m not scouring reddit 24/7, and i can only comment once every 15 minutes. yeah, all of those things really suck, and i empathize with everyone affected. my mental health has been really shitty too. it fucking sucks.</p>
<p>But there is no data to support any idea that the damage caused as a result of preventative measures will result in more deaths than the millions more that would have happened if no preventative measures were taken. sorry! </p>
<p>and that’s not to mention the economic problems you mentioned could have been mitigated with berated government policy but whatever. </p>
<p>I do think that the really stringent lockdowns have probably caused more damage than they were worth, but i don’t think you’re making any distinction. There’s no reason to be opposed to proportionate and reasonable measures. </p>
<p>and i know what feign means dipshit it’s just really weird to assume any display of emotion or compassion is manufactured for optics or some shit</p>

        <p>Did you read those?  They all pretty much say they're inconclusive but could be added to the greater picture. Also, the 4th link is the same as the first which I think you would have caught if you read them. </p>
<p>Here's one from this year that explicitly points obesity as the major factor in hospitalizations and deaths along with calling out the lockdowns as a contributor to the obesity problem.  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-020-00462-1</p>
<p>Here's one saying the lockdowns didn't have an effect and it's the size of the older and at risk population of a country that had the biggest impact. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full</p>

        <p>It can be shocking but also liberating that most people don't give a fuck about you. Most people have zero principles and just hop on what is the "right thing to do" at the time. If you find some people who deeply value individual liberty in real life, I'd say you can trust them a lot more than the general public. Some of the most trustworthy people are the "selfish assholes" who say things like they are and don't sugarcoat shit to avoid making people feel bad. But that's just my experience.</p>

<p>True. Lots of coronazis have turned into skeptics with time, by realizing that they were lied to/are still lied to on a daily basis. But I have yet to see the opposite case? There probably are a couple of exceptions to the rule because of Stockholm Syndrome but they would definitely be a minority.</p>

        <p>Good point- it would be far simpler to list truth being reported... but I'll assume your question is an honest one, the lie in this case being that we're all in this together, that sacrifice is shared and restrictions are equitable, fair, and strictly based on public health concerns.  Actually, that's referring to more than one lie we're being given</p>

        <p>There’s nothing wrong with your feelings in this regard...insofar as you recognize it’s completely contradictory to how you lived your life up until 2019. Viruses existed and killed people before covid. You and I have likely unwittingly been part of a chain of infection leading to someone’s death (from flu, norovirus, mono, take your pick, they’re all capable of being fatal sometimes). Why weren’t you taking all these measures before 2019? You could have saved lives.</p>

        <p>That the coronavirus is causing a deadly pandemic.</p>
<p>Don't believe the hype about hospitals being "overwhelmed" with covid patients. The only reason they're "overwhelmed" is because nurses are too lazy to do their jobs. There are actually fewer patents today than there were before the plandemic started, but the mainstream media doesn't want to report that.</p>

        <p>Yup. We are a tribal species. We've evolved to live our entire lives in groups of under 150 people, all of which we know more intimately than most people these days even know their spouses. We're also a very aggressive and competitive. Obviously this doesn't translate well to modern cities or modern life in general. We're always at least partly slaves to our primal biology and it hasn't changed much for tens of thousands of years and it's not gonna change anytime soon. </p>
<p>Studying even the basics of evolutionary psychology is extremely enlightening imo and I'd recommend it to everyone.</p>

<p>This is why I don't even pretend to GAF about someone I've never met.  Because I don't.  I can say, Wow, that's sad.  I can recognize the tragedy in an untimely death (But also, IS there an untimely death?  Or do we all have a date with the Reaper and it cannot be avoided?), but if I explore deeper, do I truly GAF?  I do not.  And at least I'm honest about it.  Doomers aren't.</p>
<p>When Doomers accuse me of being a psychopath for not GAF outside of Dunbar's Number,  I just fucking own that shit.  They don't know what to do with it.  When you just say, yes.  I'm a cold blooded bitch, and I do not give any fucks about anyone else... you're right, I'm a psychopath... and we make the best serial killers...they don't know what to do with it.   And it's liberating.</p>

        <p>Hell yeah. You know what's up. I love my family and my loved ones to death, everyone else is on their own. I don't wish them any harm and I'm generally polite, I just don't care because I literally don't have the biological capacity to do so.</p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>ETA: I used to realllllly feel bad about myself.  Am I psychopath? I used to ask. Am I really incapable of experiencing empathy for other humans?  Because I DO NOT care deeply about strangers.  I'm not sitting around wringing my hands and weeping over starving children in Africa.  I have a hard time being outraged by extreme religious beliefs that allow a father to behead his daughter in a country on the other side of the globe... or even in San Franciso, CA.  For a while, I began to believe I was indeed, a messed up person, a psychopath.</p>
<p>Then I realized a few years ago - for my own children, grandchildren, parents, brother, nephew (SIL is a hard no), a handful of ride or die friends, I'd fight a pack of wolves for them. </p>
<p>I'm not a psychopath.  I just figured out what Dunbar's Number is.  This needs to be taught to people - we need to know it's okay, it's normal, to not be able to carry a ton of emotion for people that never enter into our sphere, our tribe.</p>

        <p>Trust me, I know how you feel. If you feel a shred of empathy for any other living being other than yourself, you're not a psychopath.</p>
<p>We live in a world which is massively unfit and unnatural for the human psyche. Our ancestors met less strangers in their lifetime than we do when we visit the grocery store. Our brain literally has to dehumanize them to an extent because it cannot handle the amount of complex social structures involved with other humans.</p>
<p>People do care about others, but on a very surface level. Neutrally. Wish no harm but don't really pay that much thought or emotion into it. That changes fast when there is a situation going on that is heated with emotion or is a direct threat, in the real world and people are sharing the same physical space. Like if people are fighting for a piece of toilet paper lol, it's every man for themselves. But also if there is like a catastrophe or something it bring random strangers who are sharing the experience together, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>Most people don't admit to only caring on a surface level about others because it's a social norm not to say such things. But we aren't a true tribe, and actions and inner emotions speak louder than words.</p>

        <p>VERY well put.  </p>
<p>I absolutely know if I opened myself up to all the horror and tragedy and death that is inherent to life and is the plight of strangers, and really spent time on those emotions, I would need to just be put down.  I would sob uncontrollably all the time - I've experienced moments like this, and they were horrible.  Our mental well being, our spiritual well being, relies on us being capable of putting that emotional energy into the people closest to us.  </p>
<p>I was so much happier when I admitted that to myself, despite what the modern societal norm says I'm supposed to do.  I don't lie to myself or others about it anymore.  Personally, I think if we'd shed that lie, be honest, help the ones closest to us, where we can make a difference, the world would be a better place, because I feel like the places where our tribes 'touch' on one another would be a better place and we'd all be a helluva lot happier and well off.</p>
<p>Instead, we have the hot mess we find 1st world nations in right now.  People don't want to defy the cultural norm and appear callous, all the while not realizing there'd be, what a British friend of mine calls, a knock on effect if they'd just work on their tribe first.</p>

        <p>I personally feel emotions very deeply, and I'm highly sensitive to the emotions of others. Might be hard to believe for someone who just glances over my post but I'm a deeply empathic person. It's critical for me to create a shell of sorts so I can function the best I can and work on creating the kind of world and life I find valuable. Maybe you can relate.</p>
<p>Putting my own needs before anything else, then putting the needs of my "tribe" before all else after that, is one of the most critical and best realizations I've ever had. I agree with you: I truly do believe that if we all KNOW and ACCEPT our human nature, the dunbar number and all its implications, we can create a more honest and prosperous society through truth and neutral but respectul concourse with the various strangers we meet through life.</p>

        <p>I am exactly like that.  If I don't maintain a shell around my 'core' I'm a useless mess.  It's overwhelming and I am helping no one by being a hot emotional mess.</p>
<p>I keep that shell up so I can function and take care of the people (and animals) I can help and always hope that there's a knock on effect.  But it also means being able to not take shit of rando strangers.  There's a limit to my kindness and once you've exceeded it, I will stonewall or get nasty right back with people.  It's all I can do - take care of me first, keep me maintained and running smooth, and then I can help my tribe, and they get priority over all others.  For them, I'm ride or die.  For others I'm more like... OH NO that's horrible... anyway....</p>
<p>I have to be.  Sounds like we're a lot alike and also quite normal and caring.</p>

        <p>Let's be honest.  If we - a collective we, including all these foaming at the mouth maskers (as opposed to someone who just wears them) - don't care about starving people across the world, human trafficking, genocide (China, anyone?) and a myriad of other things, then it's all bullshit.  They're hypocrites.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I continue to not have COVID and am therefore not spreading it. If I did have it, and as close as I sometimes have to be to others without wearing an N95 mask and covered head-to-toe, I would have spread it to the point of shutting down my job.  My 86 year-old father would have gotten it.  A shitload of other people I'm around maskless would have gotten it.  For over a year now, I've remained negative.  I know, I know "but you <em>could</em> have it and just not know!".  I could have a lot of communicable diseases and not know.  I'm not isolating over it.</p>

        <p>Yeah it felt really cathartic.</p>
<p>There are a whole lot of skeptics out there who are afraid of speaking their mind because of the social ramifications. This is extremely detrimental to the wellbeing of society as society improves by being fully and absolutely open to criticism. A society which does not allow criticism of EVERYTHING will regress is inevitably gonna fail sooner than later. I support free speech in 100% of the cases. Whether I agree with it or I think it's literal blasphemy is irrelevant.</p>

        <p>That's just degenerate behavior. In that case it's not about being able to speak freely, it's about taking responsibility for your speech. If you incite violence against someone or doxx someone and there are real life consequences for that, that's fully the responsibility of the person who did it and they should be held accountable.</p>

        <p>This.</p>
<p>It still blows my mind how sheltered from reality most people come appear to be.</p>
<p>Two of my grandparents died from pneumonia, too. It happens. No one felt <em>guilty</em> that it might have been them that passed something on to to one of them because it's just part of life. Who knows how they got sick? They were old. And they always loved spending time with family more than anything else. I can say for certain that they wouldn't want to hide away from everyone they love for a big chunk of their remaining time on earth just for fear that the inevitable <em>might</em> happen a little sooner than expected.</p>

        <p>It's part of The Big Lie, get folks to tacitly agree - without evidence. </p>
<p>The fact is we are hierarchical creatures who enjoy the comfort of our place in the hierarchy and rejecting the Big Lie outright leaves us adrift. Most will cling to it even though its nonsense and they don't even want to know it is nonsense.</p>
<p>Folks think that the government just found out we are pussies. No, we have always been and they have always known, they just have the technology available to make further use of our clinging to the Big Lie.</p>

        <p>The same kind of evidence needed to convince anyone of anything. </p>

<ol>
<li>Consistency</li>
</ol>
<p>In my province, they send people with covid home to recover, and yet healthy travellers are sent to quarantine. If home is good enough for actual patients, why wouldn't it be good enough for healthy travellers or travellers who caught it? See: power grab</p>
<p>Next, in the UK, the US and essentially in Canada and other places, they use a double standard for vaccine deaths and covid deaths:</p>
<p>a covid death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for covid, including folks who died in car accidents and from bullets</p>
<p>a vaccine death, they won't even count it beyond 20 days from an injection and they won't be counting car accident victims</p>
<p>Why no consistency?</p>
<ol>
<li>Adaptation to new data</li>
</ol>
<p>You could not get tested in my province without:</p>
<p>a. having travelled outside the province within 2 weeks</p>
<p>b. without having 2 or more symptoms</p>
<p>until December 2020. This is despite having community spread throughout the country for almost a year. And this is despite knowing that 50% are asymptomatic and 80-95% have onto or mild symptoms. This serves to increase the fear factor among the population, making the death rate seem far higher than it actual is and serves to reinforce the illusion that the restrictions are working. There is no scientific validity to it. </p>
<p>Seroprevalence is determined via T-cell studies or antibody studies on the population. Neither have been done or even suggested. Where they are done, they are largely ignored. </p>
<p>This begs the question of natural herd immunity. But since, they have ignored seroprevalence and altered their definition of herd immunity, where does this leave us?</p>
<ol>
<li>Punishment for power grabs</li>
</ol>
<p>There have been none, in fact they have been encouraged and promoted. Air Canada will sell you tickets for flights they know won't happen and then refuse to refund the money when they cancel them. They won't even allow people who have been vaccinated to return to normal and they are discussing indefinite lockdowns, not for covid, but for climate change. </p>
<ol>
<li>Open platform for discussion</li>
</ol>
<p>They will fire doctors who use officially sourced data that contradicts the narrative. They will strip them of their license. Platforms will ban people for citing WHO data, Harvard data, CDC data. This is not the response of evidence-based inquiry. </p>
<p>So, what evidence do you have that the governments actions were necessary and warranted? Oh what, you wanted to randomly assume folks didn't know anything and when asked the same question, you vanish?</p>

<p>Where is quarantine for healthy travelers? Wouldn’t that be home, making it very consistent?
Do they count it a death for things like car accidents and bullets? As far as I was aware, it was only counted as a COVID death even if they didn’t die from COVID itself when another sickness kills them when COVID weakened them, which essentially means COVID killed them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surely you understand that when the supply is low, your province would limit the COVID tests they could give out, so they wouldn’t waste them. And how does this relate to making deaths seem higher than they are? These two don’t seem connected for me...
People can still get and transmit COVID while having antibodies, so it makes sense why governments are focusing more on finding out if people have COVID, rather than testing if they are less likely to get it in the future. This strategy supplies us with current statistics, rather than guesses to what the future might hold </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large companies such as Air Canada always try to grab money, although they know loopholes so they can do it “legally,” and while this pandemic has given them another way to get money in one sense, that doesn’t mean it’s all a Big Lie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When did this happen? I know of a nurse who was fired by her job, and that’s because she said something along the lines of “don’t wear a mask.” While she may have cited data from those sources, if they tell someone to do something unsafe, that reflects badly upon the company they work for, so the company has every right to fire them. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No, I don’t think people don’t know anything, but who do you think knows science better? The normal citizen redditor who took a few science classes or the scientists, microbiologists, etc (who taught that redditor the information they know) and who urge people to stay home, wear a mask, wash your hands?
Now, here’s some evidence government’s actions were necessary and warranted. Look at New Zealand and Sweden, for example. New Zealand had strict lockdown restrictions in the beginning of the pandemic, and now restrictions are minimal, and only about 4 people a day are getting it. Sweden, however, did only some to slow the spread. They currently get 3-4 thousand new cases per day (yes, Sweden has roughly twice the population as New Zealand but that shouldn’t translate to a thousand times as many cases.)</p>
<p>Also, I am on mobile so apologies for formatting, etc</p>

        <p>Sure, let's look at Sweden:</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7369443/#Sec3title</p>
<p>"Those who died of Covid19 in Stockholm’s nursing homes had a life-remaining median somewhere in the range of 5 to 9 months"</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, the average 90 year old Canadian has a life expectancy of:</p>
<p>https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310013401</p>
<p>5.1 years.</p>
<p>So, the bulk of the people who died at the time of the above study (70%) had a life expectancy severely below that of the average 90 year old. </p>
<p>When do people who are on their last legs die? Winter. </p>
<p>So, you think that the annual flu blip is worth nation-wide lockdowns? When the people who were expected to die this year, die this year, we should freak out and close the world and give up human rights?</p>
<p>You ask a lot of questions...about things I have already answered. Are you hoping my answers will change if you ask the question? They won't, the answers are as stated initially.</p>
<p>https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/15/grand-county-covid-deaths/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter</p>
<p>"The Grand County coroner is calling attention to the way the state health department is classifying some deaths. The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>"Bock says because they tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 30 days, they were classified as “deaths among cases.”"</p>
<p>Do you think the coroner themselves who are instructed of how cases are classified don't know what they are talking about? There were a lot more who came out to speak in the spring of 2020, but then there was a massive bribe by the government in the US, paying them more to classify covid deaths and suddenly, coroners stopped speaking about it so much. But this coroner just couldn't accept calling folks who obviously died of gunshot wounds, covid victims.</p>
<p>That's your science. Those are the guys you trust. The guys who took the money, and call anyone who died within a month a covid victim, but won't say the same about vaccines. </p>
<p>As for places miraculously being covid-free. Science is not on your side. T-cell tests identified 47 additional covid cases in a population where PCR tests had only found 70. Thats a huge false negative rate. And these are of folks who a. had symptoms b. went to get a PCR test because they believed they had covid. </p>
<p>And they still were told they didn't have it. Only later t-cell tests showed that they had.</p>
<p>So, how does New Zealand eliminate it, when they can't even identify nearly half the cases, when they have symptoms?</p>
<p>They pushed the timeline back on covid, saying it started in Italy, in September 2019. They have positive results from people doing bloodwork during that period. </p>
<p>https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2020-11-17/COVID-19-was-spreading-in-Italy-by-September-2019-study-indicates-VuSqUttP8s/index.html</p>
<p>"blood samples taken in September 2019 showed the presence of the antibodies against the Sars-Cov-2 virus.</p>
<p>"What we noticed, and it was unexpected, we found more than 10 percent of the samples presenting antibodies against the COVID-19 virus," said Sozzi.</p>
<p>How can you have 10% of a selection of the population apparently have a super deadly disease and not notice it for 6 months? No lockdown, masks, vaccines. No indication that there was anything wrong.</p>

        <p>That example is completely irrelevant. Not only is it talking about deaths, rather than cases, but it is just a looking at a subset of the Swedish population, those in nursing homes.</p>
<p>2 gunshot deaths classified as COVID in Denver. I agree, that should not have happened bt that doesn’t equate to a international conspiracy. And I suppose I’ll just have to take your word for all the others coming out to speak about this who were bribed.</p>
<p>Can you link the evidence to what you say about T-cell tests compared to PCR tests? I’d be interested to look at it.</p>
<p>Do you know what mutations are? Because they can make a virus that was once harmless harmful.</p>

<p>&rt;I agree, that should not have happened bt that doesn’t equate to a international conspiracy.</p>
<p>Yes, every country saying anyone who dies within a month is a covid death is not an international conspiracy, they all just became stupid at the same time. Anyone who dies within 3 hours of dying is a car accident death. Why not?</p>
<p>Google is there, I am not your errand boy. You don't seem very bright and I'd rather not convince a dummy who will go around being a dummy and make people who follow legitimate science appear to be dummies. Keep being you: a dummy with dummy ideas who shows everyone how dumb they are.</p>

        <p>This is exactly how I've come to feel about this as well. I just can't take it anymore, and I'm tired of the shaming. If people want to go see their friends and family, LET THEM. If people want to go on vacation, that's their fucking business. I don't know when we turned into this disgusting collective that rats on their neighbors to the state for social approval, but it's heartbreaking. The celebrity virtue signaling, the media pushing this constant idea to be afraid of other people because god forbid you might get a cough, and the total surrender to the government telling you how to live your lives. It makes me sick to my stomach seeing people bitching online saying, "Well this virus could be over if y'all weren't so adamant about 'yOuR rIgHtS!!1'". They just don't even care anymore about their personal liberties, and they're more than willing to sacrifice them for a false sense of safety against a 98% survival rate. Fuck this shit.

        <p>Well first off, it's more like 99.8% so that's actually 600k. Second, the average age of a Covid death is 84 which is above the life expectancy age. Third, 3 million people die every year in the US so yes, that's fine or at least it's not worth unending society over.</p>

        <p>I get it, you're playing a bit, pretending to be Trump. The problem is you don't get it. You don't understand the economy, the job market, the virus, the average person or Trump. You keep it up though. I'm sure if you scream it loud enough you'll convince someone else that Trump is literally Hitler.</p>

        <p>That is dumb. This is if we're even trusting the numbers they give us. We have seen hospitals counting car accidents with covid patients as covid deaths. We never did this for the flu, which kills plenty of Americans every year. Should we turn our lives upside down every time a sickness comes around? We have never been responsible for each other's health, and by the way every time you go out in public, you know the risks. You could get murdered, kidnapped, get in a car crash, catch a cold, anything could happen. The minute you step foot outside you should understand the risk you're taking. So don't blame someone else for you getting sick when we all knew the risks of leaving home.</p>

        <p>My mum was in hospital and almost died from actual pneumonia. She got “Covid” and survived with no medical attention. If you are super fucking ill and catch flu or something else in the mist chances are You’ll die. My nan with heart failure apparently also got Covid and survived (She’s 90 years old) . However every. Single. Person I know that’s had the vaccine has had seriously bad side effects. A naive old lady was clear of breast cancer for 8 years and 5 days after her vaccine she gets a swollen breast and severe sickness, the doctors now think the cancer is returning but they won’t say it’s to do with that toxic needle juice that was put inside of her &amp; bless her heart she doesn’t believe it’s to do with the vaccine either!</p>

        <p>It's extremely frustrating that talking about the very real possibility of short-term, not to mention long term side effects from the vaccines is considered a "conspiracy theorist" viewpoint. It's EXTREMELY concerning how they're trying to push these vaccines and trying to guilt trip people into taking them. We literally cannot know the long term side effects and I do not consent to being a guinea pig for vaccine manufacturers that are for-profit organisations.</p>

        <p>This "in it together" crap is really annoying. My company hired some self-proclaimed coach and made us all join an online meeting with some bullshit agenda, like, bring your favorite item to the meeting and explain why you love it, or lengthy stories about how someone was sick, blah blah. Then we had to sit for two hours every week and listen to this nonsense, most of us just made up some stories to finally be over with the sessions, which we gladly shared in private chats. This forced agenda is just unbearable.</p>

        <p>THANK YOU FOR WRITING THIS POST. I 1000% agree with you. Just for shits and giggles I want to let you know my son tested positive last thursday after we took a trip to new orleans. Everyone else was negative and he had ZERO symptoms. ZERO. So we took him again on Sunday and yesterday the test said NEGATIVE. I had to inform the children’s hospital he gets regular eye exams at that he tested positive and worried my son wouldn’t be able to have the preventative care he needs. I also had to cancel all school. It added so much stress and made me fearful. The health dept in IL told me to quarantine from my own 3 year old son in our home. I literally wipe his ass how much do you think I can quarantine??!?! Also what parent would treat their kid like a leper?!? My son survived an eye cancer thing last year and I am NOT going to take any day going forward for granted. It is amazing how many of my friends and couple family members were willing to stay away from us and be fearful of being with us. Life is short mother fuckers. Like you said death is mandatory - suffering is optional. I want this tattooed on my fucking body. Love your post and I am so fucking over this shit.</p>

        <p>Health department telling yo to quarantine your own child, what the fuck?! That is so infuriating. Literal child abuse. It's NOT normal to fear people to this degree.</p>
<p>I have a 3 year old step daughter I'm doing my best to give her as normal of an childhood as possible. Some adults at the daycare wear masks which is stupid, but at least they're still acting reasonably sane around here. The children are most vulnerable with this, they NEED to see faces for their psychological development and adults being constantly stressed out and paranoid is giving them much grief. I worry for the future generations, but I can rest well knowing that I'm doing my best and I'm not gonna take  part in this lunatic bullshit.</p>

        <p>Yes they told me to wear a mask in our own house and keep him in a separate room as much as possible. Like wtf he is 3!!!!! And he ended up being negative anyway. How many tests are really negative? I can’t believe I had to worry about him getting his eye exam and MRI next week for something he didnt even have!!! Im just over it and thats why I dont give a fuck anymore. It is official.</p>
<p>Also- yes you are doing your best and that’s amazing. We have to keep shit as normal as possible for our kids. They need to experience life without this drama.</p>

        <p>That's a load of horseshit! People recommending stuff like that are absolutely clueless, peak lunacy. This shit is not even dangerous to kids 😒</p>
<p>Children are so vulnerable. I can't believe there are people out there who think that masking toddlers is acceptable in any way shape or form. They're not "tough", they do not "understand", that shit is just the breeding ground for extreme psychological problems and it makes me livid.</p>

<p>As we sputter and drown in the dark, frigid water, a few of the privileged float by in their lifeboats.  They managed to get into the lifeboats, because they are a part of the elite.  </p>
<p>As they float by, they clap their hands and encourage us.  "Great show chap!  Keep kicking!  You're almost there!".  Even though they know we're already as good as dead.</p>
<p>If any of us grabs part of the boat, they kick us off.  "Get your own boat!" They scream.</p>

        <p>If Florida had gone down in flames I might care more. Sweden continues to exist. Switzerland no longer requires masks. Some countries have banned cloth masks. Others have said incorrect use of masks (taking a drink if water contaminates them once touched) makes them useless. Denmark doesn't require them. </p>
<p>Other places in the US with no statewide mandate? Montana, Wyoming, Wisconsin, Nevada, Idaho, South Dakota, South Carolina, Texas, Iowa, Mississippi, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Local governments have a say, and in a few states there are job-related requirements, but the average person doesn't have to wear them. These states still exist.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to say COVID doesn't exist. I also believe it is, as of now, more dangerous than the flu (though the percentage of COVID deaths is extremely low, whether you count entire populations or just those infected). However, flu season doesn't keep me inside and neither should this. In fact, it doesn't keep me inside at all.</p>

        <p>Even during real pandemics, things were never this locked down.  At one point I looked up a list of 19th century pandemics, and there were about 5 of them happening concurrently, all more dangerous to all ages than the current one.  People still lived their lives.  Watch "La Traviata"-- the lead character is dying of consumption (tuberculosis) and throws lavish parties the entire time.  I joked last summer about how "we should just make covid a fashion statement like consumption was so we can get back to partying"</p>

        <p>I am in a large city and I am so sick and tired of worrying about mentally unstable people attacking me because I don't feel like wearing my mask 24/7. I look around and I wonder, how many others feel like I do? There is no way I can be alone in all of this but as I look around the vast majority of people are still doing this. I'm one of the only people I see that walks around outside with no mask. People are out there jogging and riding their bikes with masks. It drives me crazy. Then there are people in their cars completely alone with masks. I honestly feel like I'm in a nightmare that I can't wake up from.</p>
<p>And like you're saying, several times a day when I hear propaganda from our government I think to myself stop trying to keep me alive against my will here. I don't want to live in a world like this. If this is how it's going to be from now on let this virus take me out. And I'm not afraid of it anyway. I believe in God and I accept God's plan for me. If the plan is for me to die right now then that's it. I'm not so obsessed with dying that I'm going to stop living and be a shell of a person. As that old expression goes, it's not about the years in your life it's about the life in your years. I think many of us are at our boiling points , this has simply got to end. I become more and more angry with people that are going along with this and acting like Hall monitors with the rest of us.</p>

        <p>Embrace the emotion. Soon it will turn to willingness to to defend yourself to death if necessary. This is one of the most powerful feelings known to man and if you learn to breathe and be with this feeling, this alone makes you more powerful than most other people you'll meet on the street. Your posture and the energy you radiate outwards will reflect to change this. And people will leave you alone.</p>
<p>On the moment of my death, I know I am united with god. I have nothing to fear from death.</p>

        <p>This was awesome thank you so much! I am a woman in New York City, I am surrounded by brain dead zombies. I actually live in Queens which is not as bad as Manhattan but I refuse to wear the mask outside. I've even started shopping later in the evenings which I did before this whole thing anyway I don't like crowded stores, but when I go to the store later in the evening I don't wear the mask while I'm grocery shopping. I've gotten a few looks but nobody's been crazy on me. I am prepared for them to be which is why I've now started carrying pepper spray. I hope I never have to use it but I'm prepared. There are a lot of mentally unstable people and I think this whole experience has triggered something in them and there may be no coming back from this for them.</p>
<p>I feel the same as you though, I am ready to die and I'm not afraid of it. I trust in God's plan for me. I know that this life is short and I want to make the most of it while I'm here I don't want to waste it locked away from other human beings. Most of my family is already on the other side, whatever you want to call it. I really prefer not to die yet, I feel that I have some more living to do but if I do die I'm confident that it will be great where I'm going and I will be reunited with people I love more than anything. I resent this manipulative agenda that we are being terrorized into behaving as they want us to through guilt and shaming. I work in healthcare and I've spent my whole life taking care of other people and caring about others and this is the farthest thing from that. The destruction that this is brought on us is one of the biggest crimes against humanity in Civilization. There is nothing loving or caring about this. It's sick.</p>

        <p>Honestly, if I was in the USA I'd get a gun and carry it with me absolutely everywhere. Can't even do that here in the People's Republic of Europe. I'm also certain as you said that I'm sharing the streets with some absolutely mentally wrecked people who are ready to go off at moment's notice. As soon as I have the resources I will begin learning martial arts myself.</p>
<p>The latter paragraph, I agree 100%. This is a matter of principles for me, personal liberty is absolutely paramount as protection against tyranny as we are seeing the effects of what even tiny seeds of collectivism is doing to society. "Be a good person" sounds all fine and dandy on paper but in practice it leads to authoritarianism, since people will be inclined to police each other to conform. It's madness and I want no part in it. Glad to here your family in sane at least.</p>

        <p>I like the martial arts idea! I now have pepper spray and pepper gel and carry on me in case I am assaulted. The crime level here has skyrocketed. I do not condone violence but if I am assaulted I need to be able to protect myself. I have thought learning self defense too. .. I just submitted my application for a pistol and a rifle here. Because I am in nyc I could never carry outside my home but I now don't even feel safe at home. Someone did try to break in years ago when I was in here and it terrified me. I am going to get a pistol and learn how to use it and hope I never ever have to use it. But I feel extremely vulnerable and not safe anymore.</p>
<p>I really hope things get better where you are, people are ready to break. I think things are going to get very ugly soon if this continues. At least you have your wits and you see this for what it is. I don't believe most people are still believing this at this point but maybe I give others more credit than I should.</p>

        <p>Believe me I wouldn't want to ever actually have to use violence against anyone, but I want the freedom to protect myself if necessary and the freedom to feel safe. It's great that you can even get a gun to your house. Maybe you can move to another state or to a more rural area to feel safer, that's what I would do, but of course you have your own personal life and reasons for everything. Personally I don't think cities are worth it anymore, if they ever were, and I'm looking to more to a more rural area myself.</p>
<p>Most people where I live are very docile, which is a good and a bad thing. I think the majority of people here are just gonna take the authority up their ass, some people just don't give a fuck and break the restrictions but nothing will be done about it, and in the summer nobody will care about this. I hope. It could always get worse but once enough people take that magic vaccine, I don't honestly know how they could keep the charade up any longer.</p>

        <p>Totally agree with you on the city thing, I have lived in the city and a very rural area and I now prefer a rural area. The city is a hellscape. I'm seriously thinking about moving but work is a consideration right now with this shit economy. Can't see myself being here long-term anymore though. This completely snapped me out of it.</p>
<p>I think one of two things is going to happen, gradually people are going to stop doing this and the government will realize they no longer have control over us and it will slowly dissolve away. Another theory I have is not so good and it involves them messing with the power grid this summer. I don't know why I'm thinking this but I remember last summer we had an internet outage and some widespread power outages and at the time I felt like it was a rehearsal for something. Let's hope I'm wrong about that LOL I've become extremely paranoid over the last year though! Here's to a better summer where you can get outside and start living your life again, you have a great attitude!</p>

        <p>Totally. I think cities are massively unnatural places to live in and are actually detrimental to the wellbeing of humans. I completely understand the economic concerns. I'd keep a look out for opportunities, the economy is bound to bounce back eventually.</p>
<p>Hopefully not lol, I've deliberately been avoiding all the extreme conspiracy stuff to keep my mental health in check and I'm trying to attribute this to massive incompetence and stupidity. I guess only time will tell though. I know I will do everything I can to live my life the way I want, and I'll encourage everyone to do the same :)</p>

        <p>I'm going to hang on to your comment about massive incompetence and stupidity LOL I seriously hope you are right. The thoughts I have had over the months have been pretty insane, I mean what else can be expected when you're cut off from everything and you have time to think about what's going on? I do feel like you though in that cities don't make sense to me anymore. And I once loved cities I couldn't imagine living elsewhere after growing up in a very rural area. Not anymore though, I never want to be in such a vulnerable position ever again. Last summer with the riots and all the violence all I could think of was if I get out of this alive I'm never going to live in a city again this is enough. Hopefully things will start looking up job wise within the next year. I hope you can get out as well! At least we have places like this to come to, I know for me it's been a great help! I am surrounded by people who appear to to have brain damage at this point and they're not able to think clearly!</p>

        <p>If it's safe to wear a mask and do your job at a grocery store and interact with countless strangers, why can't those same employees wear that same mask and hang out with their friends and family?</p>

        <p>Haha, thank you. Brilliant and scathing write-up .</p>
<p>If Doomers and the government actually cared about peoples health, they would be fighting for cumpulsory exercise, and making fast food and soda illegal. </p>
<p>That would save far more lives in the long run.</p>
<p>News Flash, lockdowns arent saving lives, as you and the science have pointed out.</p>

        <p>Exactly. In a way, I take the pAnDeMiC more seriously than people who just slap that fucking mask on and move about their day. I'm healthier than I've ever been in my life due to my own personal life choices. Likewise, if I neglected my own health, that's my problem and mine alone. No-one else to blame.</p>

        <p>Preach man! I have a medical condition as well and my family is extra paranoid about this "deadly" virus, because of my sickness. At my age, even with my chronic illness I have at least a 97.4% chance of survival. This nonsense fear mongering has ruined my life for the past year. My parents are paranoid. My dad is a paranoid double-masker, and he wants me to wear two masks and a face-shield anytime I go to work.</p>
<p>I would rather live the rest of my life - no matter how short - with peace and normalcy, than to have my quality of life taken away to hide from a 99% survival rate virus.</p>

<p>Many "at-risk" people would probably totally agree with you. I think it's beyond criminal to have this choice taken away from them. People dying alone in nursing home, confused, not allowed to hug their loves ones one last time. That shit makes me fucking furious.</p>
<p>Rather live life than constantly fear death. Might as well be dead at that point anyway, I say.</p>

        <p>Just FYI, no one in the medical community goes by survival rate, they go off mortality rate. 3% is actually pretty dang high. Obviously not ebola high, but still. And people who get COVID and have comorbidities likely have a higher chance of being more sick for longer with possible lifelong changes. Obviously life your life how you want to, but don't blame your family for trying to protect you. They don't want to see you sick and I think that's fair.</p>

        <p>The moment you're not allowed to question the scientific consensus, it's not longer science, it's a belief system.</p>
<p>The same scientists who've said that fat is bad but sugar is okay, cigarettes are no big deal and there's no harm in using DDT for crops. Yeah, "science" absolutely can be bought, has been bought in the past, is being bought in the present and will be bought in the future unless we keep questioning what we're being told and who benefits from the messaging. Confirmation bias is also a very real thing, especially when you have a wad of cash in your pocket.</p>

        <p>My life is destroyed because of Covid (no social contact at all since 1 years because uni is closed like pretty much everything else)
I can’t stand the “stay home it’s easy just watch Netflix” anymore or the “boomers phrase” like 
“How would you react during WWII? You’re such a pussy” “think about soldiers during the WWI and don’t complain” 
I can’t take this shit anymore, almost only really old people does. Alcohol kills much more people and we’re still encouraging drinking. This doesn’t make any sense. 
But a little virus that kills olds people that too much ... 
In France restaurants are closed since october ! And they probably won’t open again before June ...</p>

        <p>I definitely identify more with liberal than  Republican, but none of this is a partisan thing for me, it’s just a human rights thing. I’ve arrived in the city, and it’s worse than I thought it could be. Our office looks like a nuclear war zone, with plastic guards everywhere, mask signs everywhere, sanitizer everywhere, it’s just disgusting. And I have five days of this. Kill me now. It took me over 10 hours driving to get here, and when I arrived just gone 8 o’clock, nowhere open to get any dinner. . I found my favorite pizza joint which seems to have survived, and when I went inside, the person serving wasn’t wearing a mask and it was such a great moment. I promptly took mine off. Maybe there’s hope.</p>

        <p>I'm in mainland europe myself so US politics seems such a wild ride to me, but lately I'm finding myself agreeing more with right-wingers which is a totally new experience for me. If anything I've found out I'm more of a libertarian than a liberal in the modern sense of the word.</p>
<p>Anyway, glad to hear that at least some places are staying sane. Seeing other people not wearing a mask is always such a sigh of relief. The constant security theater is beyond irritating at this point. All the best to you!</p>

        <p>I can’t  even believe I’m going to say this, but I know what you mean. Being a Brit, I was always way more of a labor supporter in England, not a conservative. But since this has happened, I’m so disappointed with the Dems. But again, for myself personally it’s not a partisan thing although really it is, there’s no avoiding that. But for me it’s just more of a human rights thing however I agree that politics is a massive part of it. It can’t be denied.</p>

        <p>I actually use the "F" word once and everyone was shocked. Was raised with the belief that only folks without good vocabularies use profanity.</p>
<p>In all the fifty years I knew my father I never heard him use a word stronger than "Rats!" or "Arrgh." Mom is 91 now and I don't think she ever has said anything stronger than "Well!" I grew up in a town where I never heard anyone use a swear-word until I went to college.  </p>
<p>I still have never had anything but broadcast radio and television, so no swear-words there.  Occasionally check a movie out of the library and discover to my shock that there are words or scenes in them that I don't remember from the TV version, it really spoils the movie for me. </p>
<p>Swear-words just do not exist in my universe. I thought everyone was the same way, but apparently "modern" music has profanity? So confusing.</p>

        <p>I was fully aware that the general population was stupid and ignorant before this started, and I was equally aware that it's possible to compel behaviour via social example and social shaming. </p>
<p>But I didn't realise how bad the situation has become. It's not too harsh to describe people as sheep. And you are striking the nail firmly on the head when you state in the OP that what most are primarily concerned with is being seen to do the socially 'correct' thing. </p>
<p>What I would say is that there is a silent or quiet percentage - I would like to believe it's the majority, but it's certainly a significant minority - who don't really believe in it, and are just going along with it because they've been told to do it. </p>
<p>I've had several jobs done in my house during the pandemic, and it's been my gleeful privilege to inform people that they don't need to wear a mask. Some will still do so, but it's great when they rip them straight off and say "thank fuck for that". I have three cleaners who come round and do my house once per week, and they know that they never need to wear a mask in my house, and they were so relieved when I first told them!</p>
<p>So I think the situation is perhaps not as bad as you might imagine, but I certainly applaud the sentiments of the OP.</p>

        <p>If it were truly deadly  all flights  both domestic and international would be canceled/shut down and probably be even road blocks along the major interstates and freeways around the country.   Stores would be shutdown (or at the very least strict control at grocery stores with timed limits,  physical barriers to control the flow) and many many government and military checkpoints around the cities. </p>
<p>None of that is happening because it’s not as deadly as they claim it is. </p>
<p>Is it real? Yes. </p>
<p>Are the deaths real? Many are, but the actual number is a lot less than the “500k” they say</p>

        <p>“Seriously though, the extent of the goal post shifting that's occurred from the original "2 weeks to flatten the curve and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed" to where we are now, and the fact that so many people don't seem to care or even have noticed, is truly mind-boggling. I mean, surreal Twilight Zone-level shit.</p>
<p>It's like if somebody came up to you and said "hey, I need to stick the tip of my pinky up your butt to check you for ass cancer. It'll only take like 15 seconds, tops." And you're like "gee, I don't know. That sounds kind of invasive. But on the other hand, I really don't want to die of ass cancer. You say it'll only take 15 seconds?" Cut to 90 minutes later and the guy is just railing you with his giant cock. Your friend walks by and he's like, "dude, what the fuck? I thought that guy was just gonna check you for ass cancer?" And you're like: "Huh, what are you talking about? This is the 'new normal' now. We have to do this every day for two hours or the Earth will spin off its axis and spiral into the sun killing us all. Now stop being such a 'Karen,' drop your pants and bend over. We're all in this together."”</p>

        <p>No. No more politeness. These people want children to live in bubbles, never see a human face, and take puberty blocking hormones until the decide what gender they are. There is no common ground here. There is no debate to be had.</p>

        <p>There is a reason trans people have a much higher suicide rate and there is a reason that after transitioning it is exponentially higher. </p>
<p>This is a mental illness. I have the utmost sympathy for anybody suffering from it, however the way we are validating it and enabling it is doing no trans people any favours.</p>
<p>We are making a fundamental error in the way we approach this, we are acting as if the problem they face is that they were born as the wrong sex, when the real issue they face is that they do not feel comfortable with or identify as the sex they are.</p>
<p>By validating and enabling them and telling them it’s all real and they should be who they feel as if they are, we are leading them further into a rabbit-hole of mental illness and suffering. </p>
<p>We need to be giving them support and therapy, not drugs and surgery.</p>
<p>Do you want to know why the suicide rate is higher after transitioning? It’s because getting reconstructive surgery on their genitals has not only made them realize that their problem is much deeper than a superficial one such as how they appear, it’s also made them realize that now there is no chance of going back to how things were and many begin to feel like they have made a grave, life changing mistake.</p>
<p>We have to return to reality and stop catering to mental conditions. It’s not helping anybody and it’s leading society down a path of culturally-reinforced postmodern insanity.</p>
<p>Let’s quit enabling all of this and actually start supporting these people in a way that will better their mental well-being, rather than play along with delusions.</p>

        <p>Not trying to be an asshole or rock the boat here but we do deal with doomer dickheads on here constantly telling us to kill ourselves and other vile shit. Kind of hard to keep a civil tongue around such uncivilised troglodytes.</p>
<p>I don't think anything OP said comes close to that (personally don't find the "suck my cock" comment too beyond the pale, which is what I think you've taken umbridge with, if one of your comments below is anything to go by). In fact I've used a lot of the same language in some of my posts (never told them to suck my dick however as I don't want their rotting, bacteria-accumulating masked mouths anywhere near my genitals).</p>

        <p>Haha that’s the problem, we have to be so tolerant towards the other parties but them they can take away our rights and silence us why can’t we promote violence against them? They are literally being communists you know the bane of the US constitution, Nobody should murder everybody but what do you do when the person taking your rights WANTS YOU TO BE A SLAVE. Well I believe that person should be killed and all those who follow that Ideology it’s not about people DESERVING TO LIVE. If they are so DESERVING and are entitled to living a full life, why do they get to make my Quality of life horrible, literally California is a fucking horrible place to be right now since all the illegals, all the Trans, all these SPECIAL RETARDED fucks which is an insult to retarded people because they don’t have a choice to be who they are BUT YOU DO. AND YOU DECIDE TO BACK CHINA AND BEIJING BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS. Who literally made mass incarceration of colored men a thing. Why do we allow these problems I believe if these people who are committing treason to be killed as soon as they start making deals with foreign entities. Being dishonest to the American people my spending my money that I work for towards people who have nothing to do with this country. OH HOW ABOUT ever wondered how other countries can even have a such strong socialists programs is because America Fuels the world PERIOD. That’s why our elections are so important everybody was wondering about Trump and Biden in 2020, why? If we aren’t the best why would the rest of the world care about our election? Oh that’s right we are the FREE WORLD PEOPLE, YOU CAN’T KEEP FREEDOM WITHOUT HAVING TO FIGHT FOR IT EVERY FEW HUNDRED YEARS. </p>
<p>"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>Don’t dismiss this long ass text because just pick a few talking points and let’s have a discussion why are we acting so Civil towards this problem we know who won the Presidency the US military is not strong enough to fight it’s own people (It is but you can’t bomb all your cities willy nilly. They can do martial law but you know how the American’s used to do it and the Indians in the Frontier wars, AMBUSH they will never hear us, see us, or know who’s attacking them attrition is the art of war and not brute force I hope you people know</p>

        <p>On top of that, look at places like new Zealand. They have already completely reopened because they actually did something to contain the spread. I see you aren't American, but people like you are the reason we are still going thru this.</p>

We actually need the anger and pushback against all the moronic halfwit sheep <a href="https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/sheep">https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/sheep</a> because it is <strong>them</strong> that are attacking everyone else.

        <p>So true on a lot of stuff.  We as humans will never be able to fully work together to elevate our intelligence, society and consciousness.  Some people have too much ego/pride just for existing.</p>
<p>One thing though is this Pandemic started by doing nothing about already known dangerous situations.  I.E Wet markets. Wet markets, slaughterhouses and other settings like this are breeding grounds for viruses and we do little to nothing to mitigate the risk, because pride and profits.   </p>
<p>So, what we could of done is have a blase attitude towards the virus and just let it continue and kill off the "weak" while spreading exponentially.   The problem with this though is, like those breeding grounds for new pandemics, the longer this virus is around and spreads the more potential it has to become even more dangerous.  There's already variants that have a higher infection rate, but fortunately (i dont think so?) are any more deadly.  Viruses like all living things evolve/mutate.</p>
<p>But you know, fuck it and fuck everyone right?</p>

It's not about anyone trying to control you, it's about the best ways to get past this together. And why should anyone listen to your opinions about the science of it?

        <p>The problem is you might think it doesn't affect you but it can affect others. Not everyone under 70 is risk free and not everyone's immune system reacts the same way towards different viral loads. Death is the worst outcome but even good healthy people can suffer from what is called "long covid" leaving them quite debilitated.</p>

        <p>You apparently didn't understand what I wrote. For emphasis:</p>
<p>&rt; not everyone's immune system reacts the same way towards different viral loads</p>
<p>&rt; but even good healthy people can suffer</p>
<p>A young, healthy person with no comorbidities can still be affected medium and long term. And this virus is tricky because no one knows for sure yet why some people get mild symptoms and recuperate well while others get the "long haul" effect. Therefore it isn't just a matter of saying "if are in danger stay home".</p>

        <p>I understood everything you wrote. Sorry, I am not living my life in fear. There is a risk in everything. 99% of young, healthy people survive. There is more of chance of me getting incredibly sick from the flu than COVID. I’ll take that risk instead of locking myself up and abiding by every other dumb arbitrary rule that has been set in place over the last year. Quality of life over quantity.</p>

        <p>Full disclosure, my greater change in opinion is coming in waves, absolutely- I look back on my outlook mar-jul last year and I'm disappointed in myself- I look back at the last year broadly and it's the same feeling regarding the "sAcRiFiCeS" I made and how they hurt me and my family. </p>
<p>But at this point I'm just happy I was never "in it" to the point I was getting into any kind of altercation or anything along those lines. A consistent mentality of live and let live, it's at least letting me make this paradigm shift in my head without shame or regret, because I ultimately took the high road and never stooped to that level.</p>

Do I have enough money to take advantage of modern privilege and stay at home 24/7? No, I have to go to the store and to work just like everyone else. The average person can’t afford door dash and instacart everyday. Yes, I always wear a mask. No, I don’t give a shit if you do, I can keep my distance. But for fucks sake check your own privilege before posting stupid shit like this. It’s obviously not gonna be you, congratulations, but people are actually dying.</p>

        <p>Correct.  It’s very real and some deaths are real but not the “500k” they claim.  If that’s the case we’d be seeing the actual results.  Bodies pilling up in hospital parking lots and front lawns , people dropping like flies. We’d be in a total and complete shutdown with zero travel allowed. Stores shut down and people physically forced in their homes. </p>

        <p>Ok, hmm, let me put it this way, maybe it is at your level.</p>
<p><strong>People. Are. Dying.</strong></p>
<p>That is the point mate. I figured if I made fun of how OP is making it all about him/herself you guys would get the point by getting some perspective. But I guess you didn't.</p>
<p>It's mind-boggling how you can see millions of deaths and be like "ohh, but I don't want to make an effort to prever the death of other people, that would make me uncomfortable" and still think of themselves as the victims.</p>

        <p>Please continue being condescending and talk down to people; it seems to be working really well for your message.</p>
<p>The people you are labeling self-proclaimed victims are skeptical of the government's motives and believe that major media outlet coverage deserves scrutiny. Can you at least agree that nothing I wrote in the last sentence describes an irrational person?</p>

        <p>Do you really believe ALL the world's governments, media corporations, epidemiologist and healthcare workers agree with you? </p>
<p>Let's use some personal anecdotes to compare with yours. Does it not occur to you that perhaps there are healthcare workers, such as myself, or epidemioligists, like some of my family members, that do not believe everything we read online?</p>
<p>Hell there are plenty of things I learned in school that we now know are wrong. I'm skeptical about legislation being passed with insufficient information; you should be too.</p>
<p>As for how: you can be less condescending by not using condescending language and talking down to people you disagree with. But if you do that you might learn something.</p>

        <p>They agree with me? No. They act according to the data because they accept the data, as do I.</p>
<p>Guess what! I'm a healthcare worker too, and, again, i'm seeing no free hospital beds, people dying for COVID left and right and people with complications from a COVID recovery. When morons try to convince me this thing is "No big deal" it is kinda pointless, because it's their word and super convenient "skeptisism" vs. me actually seeing this shit.</p>
<p>So no. You're full of crap, and your rationalizations are an excuse to hide what this whole deal is about: You don't give a damn about the lives and livelyhood of the people affected.</p>
<p>If you're going to throw your bs excuses and conspiracy theories, yeah, I can't be anything but condecending. Want me to stop? Be sincere. Then I can call you a horrible person in a non-condecending way. I can at least respect you being honest about your selfishness... a bit.</p>

        <p>Your comment is a prime example of so much that is wrong with humanity right now. </p>
<p>Someone disagrees with you? Well don't be skeptical or ask that person questions as to why they disagree with you. Don't try to learn, understand and/or convince the other person that your way of thinking is correct. That might be productive and clearly you cannot have that. </p>
<p>If someone disagrees with you and your response is to immediatly start slandering that person/completely ignore their argument well then... you're hopeless and I pity you.</p>

<p>The data is very clear and very easily available. There's a reason why the antimaskers so often rely to conspiracy theories: because the data doesn't support their claims. Pretend all you want. At the end of the day you're just a selfish person making the world a worse place to live in.</p>

        <p>Which part of my comment is an excuse? Absolutely none of my comment is excusing anyone or anything. I'm more focused on your inability to think, learn or communicate with people. </p>
<p>There's substantial data to support both sides of the argument but seeing as you can barely understand a few sentences I don't expect you to be capable of independent research, thinking...really I'm amazed that someone with your mental incompetence doesn't drown in the tub every morning.</p>
<p>You are a self-righteous coward who will always be lonely, fugly and miserable as long as you're ignorant enough to believe everyone who disagrees with you is subhuman. </p>

Anyone’s family member who died from Corona can go fuck themselves cause they would have died anywayyyyy right on! It would be awesome to know what things you think define “living”. Cause based on the post you sound like some dumb fucking entitled ass college kid who’s mad they can’t rage all day. “If this were a truly deadly” fuck off kid. It’s dope that you have the confidence to express this online anonymously but seriously go fuck yourself.

        <p>I mean it’s killed in one year how many the flu kills in 5 years, so not really equivalent. And with most Americans being obese it poses significant health risk to many. Not to mention potential for long term complications. Look, I hate lockdowns as much as the next guy but the only reason we’re still in this is cause selfish assholes couldn’t be bothered for a few weeks to potentially save lives by momentarily adjusting their schedules. We’re almost through this, but if people fuck it up to early and something mutates and makes the vaccines ineffective then it’s back to square one. You want out of this? Deal with a little temporary discomfort. “No new normal” yeah that’s the fucking goal. It’s not a new normal, it’s a temporary break so we can get back to the normal</p>

<p>You've been lied to. The people in power use this tactic to divide and conquer. They can open up when they choose to do so. There are places that are open and have been open for a while that are doing better than the most locked down places on planet earth. Why? Because it's a highly transmissible virus and government cannot control nature. But what they can control, is your freedom. And it's diminishing day by day. I don't trust the government to take away a freedom and give it back without a fight. If you've studied history, neither should you.</p>

        <p>No, SOME people did 2 weeks or 2 months. Others protested and gathered and cut the effectiveness of such measures, prolonging the bullshit. Our government half assed it and it’s been worse than fully committing one way or the other. Staying open would have cost lives. Closing entirely hurts the economy. Instead we didn’t commit to either and lost hella lives and hurt the economy anyways. Personally I would have been fine with a month of strict lockdown. I’m fine continuing this half ass minimalist contact stuff cause it’s saving lives, but man I’m so sick of people downplaying it like it’s nothing. It IS a huge deal. Just cause you’re not in the danger demographic doesn’t mean it doesn’t pose a threat to people. It’s not lies. Was it overblown at the start? In hindsight maybe. But at the time we didn’t know how bad it could be. Now, we’re SO close to having a vaccine and herd immunity and some dumb fucks are gonna screw it up by opening up too early and we’re gonna end up with a mutation that is immune to the vaccine. I WANT covid to only be another flu, that’s what we’re almost at. Then we can go back to normal (maybe wear a mask when you’re sick cause it works? Maybe better sick leave. Idk. Some things could come from this that are okay) but this whole sub acts like this is going to be the way things are forever when that’s simply not true. It’s temporary. Even if the temporary is slightly longer than expected.</p>

        <p>The “end of the world” talk was overblown. I should have been more clear. The measures taken to minimize spread are not. And it temporary because we can look at history. Things returned to normal (with perhaps a few added protections (hand washing, mandatory vaccines, etc))after every other major disease outbreak thus far. Fear monger in his dumb, but sides. COVID won’t eliminate 50 million people, but this also isn’t an attempt to subdue the population.</p>

        <p>Interesting note about the flu when this year we had a historic drop in flu cases, down by 95% or some crazy high number like that, I’m sure you’ve heard and attribute it to masks and distancing. Also interesting how you bring up obesity as a factor, then shift to placing the responsibility on “selfish assholes” when you’re sorta admitting that the reason we’re having such a hard go of it in Merica is because people in general have poor health making them more susceptible. Maybe address some of OP’s more poignant points such as this forcibly altering the social contract rather than sit there like a typing parrot, pawning off mainstream narratives as original thoughts.</p>

        <p>Yes. The drop in flu cases is likely due to masks and social distancing. Ya know, things that reduce transmission of disease. And obesity is a factor, America has a huge problem. It contributes to many of the top causes of death and makes lesser things more deadly. There is ALSO an issue of selfish assholes who don’t want to do the bare minimum for a few weeks in order to potentially save lives. If self driving cars end up reducing road fatalities by 30% or something I’ll stop doing my own driving. Because I’m not so self-righteous to think that a small inconvenience for me isn’t worth the life of another person.</p>

        <p>Lol buddy, so people are wearing masks and distancing enough to drop flu cases by over 90%, but not enough rendering them selfish assholes and the main contributing factor of COVID spread? There’s a way out of cognitive dissonance my friend, it’s to think for yourself. Propaganda creates two opposing ideas that are allowed to exist simultaneously in your mind. And you keep saying “a few weeks”, you are aware we’re a full year from “two weeks to slow the spread” right? I guarantee if you literally  never leave your house ever again you’re reducing the chance of someone dying just because that’s how life works, you accept a certain amount of risk everytime you walk out your door, and so does everyone else, but don’t do it! Why would you even think about leaving your house when not doing so will save 1 if not many more lives!!!</p>

        <p>Man if you're too weak to wear a mask you're really going to get fucked by the virus.  I hope for all your tough guy bullshit you end up like the three people I know who got really hit by this, the 38 year old marathon runner who cant cross the break room without gasping for breath, or the two mid 30 year olds who both caught it and scarred up their lungs and now need oxygen supplied to them.  And while your suffering from this I hope you lose your parents like two of my friends have amd I hope you watch the rest of your family grow tired of your shit and start shunning you and you think back to your hollow coward ass cavalier attitude and realize that you and fools like you are the reason for your suffering.

        <p>yes i agree kill all the boomers. doesn't matter if all the weak ass grandparents die because MY immune system works PROPERLY, unlike all those WEAK people with COMPROMISED immune systems or whatever. if they REALLY cared about their health they would STOP WATCHING TV and actually GO OUTSIDE FOR ONCE. Honestly. It is my body, and it is MY. CHOICE. I get to choose if i want to help protect those around me by wearing a mask and getting vaccinated. The LAMESTREAM MEDIA doesn't get to decide what I do WITH MY BODY. A bunch of rich old white guys don't get to decide what's right for me. #freedom #i&lt;3america #pro choice             /sarcasm</p>

        <p>Did I act differently when the situation was different? Why yes.  The fact of the matter is the worst part about the virus is that we don't have the capacity for treatment. My mothers hospital has become completely dedicated to the virus, ventilators and PPE have to be rationed, they have 4 mobile morgues in the parking lot to compensate for the deaths. The relatively small amount of additional deaths are causing havoc in our medical infrastructure causing more deaths, worse care and more dangerous conditions for medical staff. You and your fellow conspiracy theorists like to boil the situation down to make it easier to swallow. "Government is lying to me because government bad" is much easier to comprehend than the vast mess of logistical, medical and societal problems that the virus as exposed and wrought.</p>

        <p>I'm trying to understand this mindset but I really can't. Do want you want and I'll do what I want. If you want to complain about people thinking you're an asshole, be my guest. I'm not really sure what your credentials are when you're dismissing COVID-19 as nothing more than a seasonal flu. We still don't really know why some people have such severe symptoms while others have none. What we do know is thah there are millions of people who are at a large risk of dying from this disease, and the risk that they'll get sick obviously increases when people don't take this seriously, even if they do everything right and stay at home. I guess you don't care if someone you don't know dies of preventable causes, but that's obviously their problem. Helping others is for the weak anyway.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying it's the seasonal flu, I'm saying in terms of the overall danger to the AVERAGE healthy individual it's COMPARABLE to that of the seasonal influenza. In fact, for some people, like children, the seasonal flu is in fact even more dangerous. But we don't lock down the enterity of society for that, why is that? The virus is no longer novel, one can argue that it never was novel in the first place, since we have encountered other coronaviruses in the past. But we certainly know a great deal about it now, have known for a while, but people and politicians act like it's the literal death sentence.</p>
<p>Why aren't the focusing on improving the health of citizens? Why not encourage everyone to eat more healthier than ever and exercise even more? Instead to force people into solitary confinemnt which is one of the most damaging things you can do to a human body and mind.</p>
<p>Severe symptoms are outliers and are massively exaggerated for clicks and general fear mongering that is always going on in media. All diseases have the capacity to procude massively more serious results in some people, no-one knows why for sure, but still life has gone on.</p>
<p>I do care about others, I care a lot actually. I'm deeply concerned for the rise of authoritarianism around the world. I don't want the future generations to live in a literal dystopia, where the government can tell you that you're not allowed to leave the house or hug your friends or you'll face fine, jail time or worse.</p>

        <p>Also, if many technically healthy people that are at a low risk need medical attention, that reduces the available recourses for others. What that means if, people can be as young and healthy as they want, but if too many get infected at the same time, there won’t be enough resources to treat everyone which leads to a big raise in lethality.</p>

        <p>I have studied this shit A LOT MORE than I ever intended to do, ignoring all the politics, and that is how I've come to the conclusions I have. By studying it with rationality, taking EVERYTHING into account including the second order effects. Recommendations from the health authorities I am 100% okay with, but treating the people like literal toddelrs who ~~cannot~~  I mean WILL NOT make their own risk assessment NOR do they get to question anything about the response, is where I draw the line. To me, it has become an issue of fundamental human rights and personal liberty.</p>

I'm not concerned about catching the virus myself, but I understand that it is bad for others and the least I can do is to wear a mask to help protect them.

        <p>Is there any evidence that mask mandates correlate with better pandemic outcomes? The burden of proof is on them.</p>
<p>&rt;How do you resolve the fact that people can't just stay away from  everyone forever? For example people with a compromised immune system  need to go shopping, and without a mask mandate they are significantly  more likely to catch covid while doing so. </p>
<p>That's unfornate but that's life. None of us is gonna make it in the end. We shouldn't fundamentally alter society to cater to those who are the most fragile, that leads to terrible outcomes.</p>

<p>Yes. Mountains of evidence^[1], as well as common sense reasoning^[2]. You said above that they do "jack and shit" - you made a claim, can you back that claim up?</p>
<p>&rt;That's unfornate but that's life. None of us is gonna make it in the end. We shouldn't fundamentally alter society to cater to those who are the most fragile, that leads to terrible outcomes.</p>
<p>I was just talking about a mask mandate. Requiring people wear a mask in shops is not "fundamentally altering society".</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] Just one good link on masks for you to ignore/misinterpret/cherry-pick from:</p>
<p>https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118</p>
<p>[2] On common sense reasoning: which of the following statements do you think is false:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Coronaviruses can be spread through respiratory particles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wearing a mask reduces the spread of respiratory particles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the viral load in an initial exposure can improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p>It is and as we disagree on that we will not find common ground. All of your other points might as well be moot to me because we don't share the same fundamental values about life and liberty.</p>
<p>There are studied pointing in both directions but let's say masks work and have no downsides. Why not wear them 24/7 for the rest of humanity's existence? To me this is where I draw the line. I'm fine with personal hygiene and recommendations from public health authorities, but I'm willing to admit I resent the very idea of masks. I wanna see faces dammit. I wanna breathe freely. The government does not own my body.</p>

        <p>You'd literally have to wear a mask for about an hour a week. Sorry not sorry but you're a selfish, petulant child. Your views are dangerously stupid, and are not based in reality at all. </p>
<p>Your freedom to act as you like ends when your actions are endangering others - that has always been the case, and is not new with coronavirus. I honestly don't know how so many people fail to wrap their skull around that fact. And if you think that your freedoms should include causing harm to others then you're practically non-human.</p>

        <p>I agree. My freedom to act as I like ends when my actions are endangering other...being that I'm not endangering others by breathing and that im not even capable of endangering others by breathing, I'm going to continue to breathe freely with no mask on</p>
<p>I really wish we could just sit the coronavirus down and have a chat with it... explain to it that its actions are endangering people, and that its freedom to swing its fist ends where our faces begin. But it's a virus with a mind of it's own and it probably wouldn't listen</p>

<p>For one, the virus is suspended in the droplets, so stopping the droplets would stop the virus. Even though the mesh of the mask is small enough that virus "cells" could pass through it.</p>
<p>Also, masks don't just work by filtering your breath. They also serve to reduce the speed of your breath, meaning that your virus-filled droplets don't spread as far. As well as redirecting it away from right in front of you, where it's likely that someone is to be for longer and thus would otherwise receive a heavier viral load from you.</p>

        <p>For posterity, what Fauci says in the relevant part of the video:</p>
<p>&rt;Right now people should not be- there's no reason to be walking round with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people "feel" a little bit better, and it may even block a droplet, but it is not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And often, there are intending consequences - people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face."</p>
<p>By the way, do you know when he said that? There's no date or other context.</p>
<p>It's an interesting clip in that I do see why Americans could see that and be convinced against masks. Though, I'm quite sure it's from very early in the pandemic, since opinions did shift in favour of masks as more data came out.</p>
<p>But anyway, it doesn't do anything to back up your original claim:</p>
<p>&rt;fauci said masks can only stop a tiny amount of "droplets" the virus itself will go through the mask like dust going through a fence</p>

        <p>Based off of the mandate dates and where they were in relation to number of cases that succeeded them, they not only "don't solve coronavirus completely" - they do jack and shit, as OP said. Then the sources we give you are the fucking charts themselves that you guys love so much since, you know, believe the science and stuff. It's as objective as you can get. You wanted an answer and we gave you one and then you, the totally non-retard who just asked me who am I quoting as a response to which I will need look no further to what you literally just said and I quote
 "I'm <strong>not going to bother</strong> explaining why that's flawed"
You said you're not going to bother. I quoted you as saying you can't be bothered and did so because you had just said that yourself. Try to pay attention to the language we all agreed upon, yes? Saying you've replied to others is a weak excuse as you, again, come marching in to our sub to try and set us straight, forgive me I don't feel like sifting through all of your downvoted to oblivion replies to help make your case for you.</p>

        <p>Yeah so, I'm pretty sure you understand that link doesn't count as citing a source. But I watched your video anyway, so will waste some of my time breaking some of it down.</p>
<p>From the video:</p>
<p>&rt;We've been told that if only Americans had worn masks for 6 weeks this thing would've been over quickly.</p>
<p>Right out the gate this guy is, as I say, a hack.</p>
<p>Who said that? Who? I can believe people like him have said it to illustrate that "covid sheep" are stupid, but not otherwise. He's just build an easy target for him to take down.</p>
<p>How could Americans masks for 6 weeks possibly stop the virus? Who could believe that? So long as there is relatively uncontrolled international travel, how can doing anything for 6 weeks stop it? Not that masks are actually supposed to totally stop spread at all anyway.</p>
<p>Mask mandates are not the #1 way to crack down on coronavirus spread. There are harsher restrictions possible which have varying degrees of effectiveness, such as restricting: international travel, non-essential businesses, on-site education, large public events, household mixing, alcohol sales, and of course a lockdown.</p>
<p>These are all restrictions which I have personally been placed under living in the UK, but when he looks at the UK graph of course he only mentions the mask mandate. For each of the <em>(self-selected)</em> graphs he looks at, the mask mandate is only a tiny portion of what went into their curve.</p>
<p>There's more I could say, but I think we'd both agree I've said enough.</p>

        <p>That first link, his "review of the medical literature" is pretty laughable. Please link which one of his sources you think up your claim. The closest one to relevance has n=32, self-reporting common cold symptoms. Most others are just looking at a mask's ability to protect the wearer, which is not at all the reason I'm arguing in favour of masks. </p>
<p>You wear a mask to protect others, not yourself. That has been the message for a long time now. It isn't that any evidence was slammed down or censored, it's just that it's not relevant. </p>
<p>&rt;Heres another one showing cases are to high and some are false</p>
<p>An anonymous article referring to an unnamed report... Some digging found the source (a now-deleted ZH article) and the Fox35 report on it.</p>
<p>The report with the incorrect figures spoken about in your article was a daily report from the Florida DoH. Their statement on the issue:</p>
<p>&rt;In recent days, the Florida Department of Health noticed that some smaller, private labs weren't reporting negative test result data to the state. The department immediately began working with these labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data.</p>
<p>That seems like a pretty reasonable explanation, don't you think? When gathering any data there will be some hiccups, especially when it's done at such a large scale. This looks like a very simple reporting error, and on its own proves nothing. If this was being done intentionally in some large organised way, there would be mountains of evidence.</p>
<p>Also, that link is not about cases being too high. The cases were correct, but the negative test results were too low. So the positivity rate was misreported briefly, but the case count wasn't.</p>

<p>&rt; therefore any and all science around it must be wrong unless it agrees with you.</p>
<p>&rt; Seriously, have you ever read a source which disagreed with your predetermined point of view, and adjusted your point of view as a result? Because I'm doubtful. I'm challenging your beliefs</p>
<p>I have provided my sources, you may or not like them because it challenges your view point, but now it is one you to provide counter evidence. </p>
<p>A common tactic is deny or reject one source because you don't like it and you just did it. Something YOU accused us of doing. So you an hypocrite. </p>

        <p>I told you what's wrong with your source, and asked you to give a specific part of it that you think backs up your point of view. Just giving a URL to a meta-analysis is not citing your sources. You can't just drop a link and call it a day, you need to create the source to your claim.

        <p>Either you are blind or are really really stupid. The source of his claims are literally in that article under review of the literature. </p>
<p>And you still haven't provided any counter source to back up your claims. This interaction is pointless as you refuse to change your point to new evidence, which proves my first point of "quite ironic".</p>
<p>I'm done arguing with you because yo have proven to me you can not provide any intelligence to a discussion.</p>

<p>Cool. Nobody said you have to or even that you should. Masks are worn to protect others around you. If you’re not around other people then by all means, take the damn thing off. I don’t wear a mask when I’m in my home or in a car alone either. I also don’t wear one when I’m on the roof of my building and nobody else is up there.</p>

<p>There are two actual sides: The many / the demos etc and the other: The very very very few / oligoi (oligarchs) / corporations / capitalists. This is how it has always been!!!</p>
<p>We should do everything in our power to convert the many that have been ideologically indoctornated to be corporate property, to speak through the voice of their masters ...to stop being like that. It is difficult to achieve, personally i am starting with my family and girflriend.</p>

<p>The state forcefully shutting down commerce is pretty much the opposite of capitalism, by definition.</p>

        <p>I believe the issue is the belief in the legitimacy of authority. The government and their forced increasingly control over the market and favoriting megacorporations is the enemy. True free-market capitalism is extremely liberating for the people. If I wanna trade 20 grams of magic mushrooms for a blowjob then that's between me and the other person and us alone, the state needs to stay the hell away from it.</p>

        <p>I don't downvote people I'm in conversation with, but I have no way of proving that so you can take my word on that or not.</p>
<p>True-free market capitalism is the default state of humanity, before government interference. We also had much tighter communities as small tribes back in on roots of mankind,.so we also had sort of socialist roots in the sense that everything was shared. But these tribes traded with each other.</p>
<p>I believe that ideal is worth working towards regardless of the state of things now or what has happened in the past.</p>

        <p>Actually, I would argue that it is free market that has gotten us to this point. Unrestricted power by the largest companies to dominate the market, which is exactly what we are seeing right now. </p>
<p>In a healthy capitalistic society, the government should be doing one thing: trust busting/breaking up monopolies. If they want to do more, they should be subsidizing start-ups and small business. But it's clearly not. In fact, we are seeing the government subsidizing these giants with TAX DOLLARS while they let small business crumble into the ground. This is not healthy entrepreneurial capitalism, this is oligarchic capitalism. </p>
<p>As a die-hard capitalist, I think it's a real shame that people just lump all capitalism into this one "big business" centered category. </p>
<p>It's just like, as much as I detest socialism, I understand that there is a BIG difference between democratic socialism and Marxist socialism. Technically, they all fall under the umbrella of "socialism", but the ideals upheld differ greatly when it comes to who is in control (the people or the government).</p>

        <p>Yes, i understand you people think like the old masters who were more attached to nationhood (the bourgeoise) just like neoliberals think like the new cosmopolitan masters (neoliberals)</p>
<p>I suggest you read the communist manifesto, to learn what you're arguing against. It's very very very small book made for workers who barely could read \~170 years ago.</p>

        <p>I actually have read it and have a copy of it on my book shelf, right now, but thank you for the reading suggestion :) It's actually a fairly dense read by today's literary standards, written by a mad man fully obsessed with overthrowing market controlled business and wishing for an authoritarian government. Hence my reference to Marxist Capitalism (as the book was co-written by Karl Marx). I put it on the same level of narcissistic, nonsensical, brain-washing drivel as Mein Kampf (which is on my shelf right next to it).</p>
<p>Not my cup of tea but, as with Mein Kampf, I can see why it would appeal to the overworked uneducated population who it was targeting. Just read anything by Upton Sinclair if you want a look into the mentality of the time. One of the great muckrakers of history, though dilusionally obsessed with Marxist ideals.</p>

<li>Capitalism =/= corporatism</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t lump the small/medium size businesses and the entrepreneurs who own them with the oligarchy. </p>
<p>Millionaires are not billionaires. </p>
<p><strong>Billionaires, who are the majority stakeholders of the large corporations, want you to work for them so you fall under their corporate law, thus are not guaranteed any constitutional rights.</strong></p>
<p>So shut down all small businesses. Buy out all the medium sized ones. Now everyone has to work for a corporation. Sure you’re guaranteed $15/hr because the corporations can afford it, but you have to abide by their corporate law. </p>
<ol>
<li>This is what we’re trying to point out by COVID response being overblown. It was not necessary to shut down businesses etc, but it is one chess move towards what I marked in <strong>bold</strong> above. </li>
</ol>
<p>It’s <em>sort of</em> a corporate communism. Where the means of production are owned by the people, kind of, through stocks and thus sharing a stake in the company. But the corporate overlords still hold the majority thus have the final say. And this may actually be a good option for many people.</p>
<p>But the problem is when they force the smaller businesses to shut down. Someone with their own means of doing business and providing for themselves cannot be held to corporate standards, and has their freedom protected by the constitution. </p>
<p>I could go on but I’m done pooping now.</p>

        <p>Well you’re right I didn’t use the word incorrectly because I wasn’t even talking about government. I’m saying a corporation provides for its workers, gives them part ownership, gives them healthcare, etc, but you have to abide by their rules. </p>
<p>It’s obviously not a real definition. There is no word to use for what I am describing. </p>
<p>Sorry if I triggered you by using youre preferred method of governance incorrectly, maybe I should’ve used the phrase “corporate fascism” and you would’ve jumped aboard the thought train instead of dismissing it entirely.</p>

        <p>That’s fine op. Just do note, I urge you to not use neither your private insurance( its still based on shared risk of those who pay) nor public one.</p>
<p>If you need emergency because of pneumonia and you can’t breathe, please remind yourself it’s just bullshit and you will bootstrap this.</p>

        <p>Because two of my friends fucking died from double pneumonia. It was caused by covid. They got thinking its just a flu bro. They went out with a friend from overseas for a coffee.</p>
<p>Few days later he calls them to tell them he has a fever and got tested and had covid.</p>
<p>They have most certainly contracted it from him, they tried to lay in bed for 4 days. They got better around 6th and ended up in hospital from not being able to breathe on 8th day.</p>
<p>Their pneumonia progressed from covid, they had cytokine storm and fever, their lungs operated barely and doctors had to puncture their lungs to remove fluid.</p>
<p>They fucking died in their 40s.</p>
<p>What the fuck is wrong with you to understand that this fucking happens and it’s a Russian roulette ?</p>

        <p>I couldn’t type out because of post time limit. They had no comorbidities, they smoked one pack of cigarettes per month. I don’t think that’s considered heavy smoking.</p>
<p>Aside from that I don’t know their health history, they’ve been active in sports and  weren’t fat either. I know lots of americans are in here and most of u here are protesting what your states have ensued.</p>
<p>Im from Serbia where most doctors in Europe have died in hospitals from contracting covid. Despite wearing masks they have gotten infected because they were stuffed day in and out among the sick.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry for your loss. But you have to note that it was extremely unfortunate what happened. The death rate for their age is less than 0.02%. It is not common. The vast majority of people their age don't even know they contract it. Again I'm sorry, but it's no reason to close entire countries down because of a really unfortunate event</p>

        <p>Thank you for being normal, got death wishes and threats in my inbox.</p>
<p>Yes it was their risk, my country doesn’t have drastic measures. You are obliged to wear a mask inside super market, but you can go to restaurant or caffe at the table without a mask. You can walk in park without the mask. You can walk the city without the mask.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate case, but what OP says is relativizing it as some sort of hoax made to force people to wear masks and be subservient to the government. Lots of USA people here turn this into politics, whereas in my country if anything, liberals are the ones against lockdowns. </p>
<p>I never said to close entire country down,  nobody can survive that. I said that op shouldn’t say how its a meme virus that doesn’t exist and that pneumonia isnt covid( duh), but it does cause it and its not respiratory virus. It affects all organs. Its more like a polio than it is a flu. </p>
<p>I don’t wear mask everywhere, i just wear it indoors where theres a lot of people. Hell I went to croatia for vacation this summer and barely wore a mask aside from entering shops and when being near crowded places.</p>
<p>How is this liberal lunacy?</p>

        <p>Yes.   and I'd say it again!</p>
<p>He said covid is bad because his friends died of pneumonia.  Yes I'm paraphrasing here because you have trouble comprehending.</p>
<p>He responded to a post about not wanting to remain locked down.</p>
<p>He responded to a post about wanting to go back to being free like we were before 2020.</p>
<p>He responded to a post about covid and in that comment, he said "they were thinking it was just the flu" as if influenza doesn't ALSO LEAD TO PNEUMONIA!</p>
<p>It does.  Influenza also leads to pneumonia.  That was my point.</p>
<p>NO ONE says, "just the flu" in a statement about needing to take covid seriously unless they think that the flu is absolutely harmless.</p>
<p>He's not afraid of influenza or bacterial infection.  He's only afraid of covid because he thinks that only covid can lead to pneumonia.</p>
<p>He said that we need to stay locked up because HIS FRIENDS DIED OF PNEUMONIA, but the truth of it is that he didn't stay inside once in his life before 2020 while OTHER PEOPLE'S FRIENDS WERE DYING OF PNEUMONIA.</p>
<p>I read his statement.  You obviously did not.</p>

<p>His point was that his friends got pneumonia, but because of also contracting COVID their pneumonia ended up becoming worse than it otherwise would have been which contributed to their deaths.</p>

        <p>They knew the risk of a gathering, they run with the a risk. Like OP and rest of us here not only already do, but fight for losing freedom and agency over it. People know the risk of gorging themselves on fast food garbage, but still get admitted into hospitals for obesity induced illnesses. Or take risk drinking &amp; doing drugs, but still get treated for failing liver or overdose... In fact, all these examples of health neglect esp. fat people are more burden on healthcare than any other.</p>
