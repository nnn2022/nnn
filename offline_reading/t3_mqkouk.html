        <p>The main point behind my rambling is why are they trying to convey the message of a safe vaccine to the people that already think it’s safe? No Trump supporter will watch this, and if they do by accident, they won’t believe it. I’m just confused by what they’re trying to do ya know</p>

        <p>Scroll to see rest of the photos </p>
<p>So I’ve seen the YouTube videos of Fauci talking to you tubers about covid, but it’s mostly about the vaccine. Everyone here knows that it seems like Fauci is loving his bit of fame, and this could all be chalked up to him taking every opportunity to gain attention. I think it’s a bit deeper than that. Take the game theory video for example. </p>
<p>The whole attention grab of the video is about whether the vaccine is safe or not. Kinda odd in my opinion. You’d think it’d be more about the effectiveness of the vaccine, how long the roll out will be, maybe the technology behind the new vaccines, and a bit about their safety. The thing is, majority of people don’t question most vaccines. Your run of the mill anti vaxxer will say they cause autism or other things, and they avoid all vaccines, or as many as possible. But your average person does not question the safety of vaccines. Even very conspiratorial people like myself don’t really question widespread vaccines, except maybe the business behind them. </p>
<p>So if you go on YouTube, scrolling down far enough you’ll see a whole section dedicated to Fauci going on people’s channels and talking specifically about the vaccine. Some of these channels have as little as 200k subscribers, which in 2021 is fucking nothing. </p>
<p>Now after seeing this tweet, it really makes me think, and it seems like (((they))) are trying so hard to target the youth with their narrative. It’s mostly kids that watch game theory. It’s literally a YouTube channel about video game lore and theoretical things within video games. Why would a children’s YouTube channel be talking about the safety of the covid vaccine? </p>
<p>My other thing is that atleast from what I see from my peers and the internet (I’m in my early 20’s btw) unless you’re a trump supporter, you have no qualms with the vaccine, atleast publicly. Besides my close friend who wasn’t a fan of Trump but is adamant about not getting the vaccine. I already know plenty of people I went to highscool with that have gotten the vaccine. Kinda freaks me out tbh. I don’t get the motivation behind getting it. If you’re in your 40’s, 50’s or later, I can begin to understand, but not now. Not at all. My therapist recently asked me where I was at within regards to the vaccine and all I could say without sounding the conspiracy alarm bells was “maybe if I was in my 60’s I’d consider it”. </p>
<p>Without digressing too much, my point is that with knowing that it’s mostly Trump supporters that are against the vaccine (and still, many Trump supporters are getting the vaccine) it begs the question why are they using celebrities to make people feel better about getting the vaccine? It’s all just so fucking weird to me. The idea of a bunch of celebs getting together on a news network and telling as many people as possible that you don’t have to worry, the vaccine is safe, just get it, etc. but the other point is that the only people that will watch this garbage are non Trump supporters, that likely have no qualms with the vaccine at all. So my conspiracy mind goes further and wonders, is this just a spit in the face of the people questioning the vaccine? It’s just all so fucking weird, can’t put my finger on it, but I wanted to share because ever since I saw that whole youtube section with Fauci going onto literally every fucking YouTube channel that would let the Keebler elf speak, often on children’s channels, and often specially about the safety of the vaccine, it spooked me out a lil. </p>
<p>To close, I still don’t plan on getting the vax, but compared to a few months ago, I’m honestly less worried about the potential dangers of the vaccine itself and way more worried about the precedents that are currently being set, including the passport shit, and the crazy social pressure going on. we’re undergoing a huge experiment on the human psyche, it’s pretty wild. </p>
<p>Also for the love of god would someone make a telegram group or something because I’m thinking this sub will get banned sooner or later. It’s getting bigger and more people know about it than ever.</p>

        <p>What really bugged me was Matthew Mcconaughey. Look, I get that he isn't a Republican or a Trump Supporter, but he never seemed like a leftist asshole either. He sorta kept to himself. I hate it when someone who I really respect turns out to be a shill.</p>
