        <p>I like him. I don't always agree with him but I like him. In an era of cancel culture and mass outrage, he's weathered every storm and remains unrepentant in speaking his mind. More people should be like him, concerned with what they want to say and do, rather than with silencing others and concerned with the opinion of the herd.</p>

        <p>I love him! Yes he’s blunt and harsh but I consider him half political commentator and half comedian. His past videos used to be quite humorous, but I think he’s trying to move towards professional commentating/journalism now. This video is pretty spot on.</p>

        <p>Haha that's the first PJW vid my husband and I watched in awhile. We like him, but he gets us too riled up sometimes. And we have a few bones to pick when it comes to things like masturbation, pornography, overpopulation, etc. Perhaps "overpopulation" is the wrong word, and population control isn't the right answer, but many of the issues we see today are perhaps at least partially to blame on population density. That's neither here nor there though.</p>
