    <strong>An Exercise Of Human Rights: Who Has More Right Than Someone Else? Vaccine Passports</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/vaccine-passport-premier-criticism-1.6087420">Sask. premier's dismissal of vaccine passports for events draws ire from resident, opposition</a></p>
<p><em>"Yes it's outdoors which is safer, yes hopefully the majority of  the people in the stadium are vaccinated — but just knowing that we  could end up sitting in seats beside somebody who is unvaccinated … as a  parent it just makes me nervous," Hammond said.</em>  </p>
<p>Who's rights supercede the others rights? Here we see an example of rights clashing with one another..</p>
<p>We have someone who is driven by FEAR and SUSPICION, who wants to freely attend an event, VS a 'perfectly healthy person unless proven to be otherwise' also wants to freely attend an event.</p>
<p>One party gets to attend the event freely, while the other party will have to 1) Get vaccinated 2) Expose their medical information 3) Submit to Vaccine Passport use</p>
<p><strong>Which party is IMPOSING on the other? This is a good indicator of who's rights are being trampled, and who is not.</strong></p>
<p>Is the fearful and suspicious person having their rights trampled? Isn't it up to them to take responsibility for their own fear and safety and decide whether they should attend an event with 'others'? Do they have any right to 100% safety? Do their needs IMPOSE upon anyone else's rights, freedoms or dignity in the process?</p>
<p>What about the other? The 'perfectly healthy person' who has decided to forego the Vaccination, and continue on with their lives. Unless proven to be a danger to others - which requires a doctor and a court order - are they IMPOSING upon anyone else's rights in order to attend the same event?</p>
<p>To me this is a no-brainer and defaults to <em>"If you're scared, stay home, or wear ADEQUATE ppe to protect yourself against a 'highly contagious airborne killer virus variant'  - which requires an air-sealed respirator air-filtered mask and body suit"</em> - why is up to me and others to make them feel safe?</p>
<p>Is "I feel nervous" justification to coerce and force other people to Vaccinate, and participate in a QR-Code based or other Vaccine Passport system?</p>
<p>If this is so serious to these people, </p>
<p>1) Why is the event even being held.</p>
<p>2) Why are they attending the event</p>
<p>3) Why do they feel that their fear and suspicion is enough to justify the coercing, forcing or any other measure that tramples on the rights, freedoms and dignities of their fellow Canadians?</p></p>
