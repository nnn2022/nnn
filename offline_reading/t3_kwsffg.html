        <p>That article has a major contradiction right in the first few paragraphs:</p>
<p>"The virus is a grim menace now because it is an unfamiliar pathogen that can overwhelm the adult immune system, which has not been trained to fight it. That will no longer be the case once everyone has been exposed to either the virus or vaccine.</p>
<p>Children, on the other hand, are constantly challenged by pathogens that are new to their bodies, and that is one reason they are more adept than adults at fending off the coronavirus."</p>
<p>So, they say that because the virus is an unfamiliar pathogen to an adult immune system that it is very dangerous. But, then they say that kids bodies are good at fending off the coronavirus because it is a new pathogen to their immune system. </p>
<p>So, kids don't get sick because it's a new pathogen but adults get really sick because it's a new pathogen? </p>
<p>Wouldn't the adult immune system fight the virus better because they have been exposed to more pathogens? It doesn't make any sense. Aren't some diseases, like the flu, more dangerous for children because their immune systems aren't fully developed? Are they just making shit up as they go along?</p>

        <p>That and the evidence is that it's not an unfamiliar pathogen at all and that many people were already immune to it.</p>
<p>If this were a "novel virus" it would have ripped through the human race like a child through wrapping paper on Xmas day. It's not. It's the common cold and as such many people have caught the common cold and obtained either complete or partial immunity to it. </p>
<p>I know, this year they've gone around trying to sneakily alter the definition of the common cold rather like the WHO's new lie about herd immunity but the truth remains the truth - it's the common cold. And as such there's nothing new about it at all - it's just a bit stronger than the cold is normally and in a year or two, it'll be the common cold all over again.</p>

        <p>I'll play Devil's Advocate here but I think that's the same principle as with chickenpox: for children it is annoying but rarely lethal, for adults it is dangerous if they didn't get it as kids or were vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Ok, so children's immune systems are better because they havent been exposed to as many pathogens? Then, why is it that some illnesses are more deadly for children than adults?</p>

<p>Fuck if I know, that's a question for an immunologist.</p>
