        <p>But how healthy were they really? Young, healthy people drop dead of undiagnosed heart conditions or blood clots every single day.</p>

        <p>Pretty obvious the virus is not real at this point. It's the flu</p>

        <p>No, it isn't. It killed both my parents and I'm tired of hearing "It's the flu!" from people like you.</p>
<p>If it 'wuz da blue' then my mother who was healthier than me would have LAUGHED at it and recovered. She didn't. She got blue spots on her face (the sign of hypoxia) from CoVid-19 and had to be taken to a hospital because I was fearful that she was going to die unless she was taken there.</p>
<p>She still died anyway but that is another subject.</p>
<p>Healthy people are dying from this virus and that is the scary thing about it: That healthy people with no large health issues are being killed by it.</p>
<p>Now that said: It does appear that the problem is linked to low Vit. D, Vit. C and Zinc levels but about 75% of society have low levels of those things. Understand why so many are scared now?</p>

        <p>She's worth listening to on talk radio. She gets experts and politicians from both sides on and doesn't let them get around her questions. A real journalist.</p>
