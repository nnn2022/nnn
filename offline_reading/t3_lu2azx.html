    <strong>I had a mental breakdown about the new normal last night.</strong>
    <p><p>In my previous post a few weeks ago, I detailed the prophecies of Vin Armani, basically saying that we are going to be spending the rest of our lives wearing (multiple) masks, social distancing, and getting vaccines and Covid tests regularly because we are entering a new dark age that everyone alive is not going to live to see the end of, according to the Human Social Cycle. I emphasized that his track record of being able to predict the events of the last year is unbelievably accurate. I wish I could say that this is fear porn, but his track record speaks for itself. This is an ancient, eternal cycle that humanity has always been going through, and no amount of resistance or hope will change things.</p>
<p>The cause of my mental breakdown was based on that last paragraph. I'm at a point where I feel that every hope and dream I had for the future has been totally destroyed. Two of the things that I had hoped to do someday were to take an actual out-of-country vacation with friends/family that wasn't on a cruise ship (I've been on 12 cruises in my life) and to attend a Super Bowl. I have this feeling that if I want to do things like that, it's already too late because according to the man who dubs himself "Vinstradamus", the current Covid-related tyranny is here to stay, and is only going to get worse, and I'm not going to live to see the end of it, whether I live to be 30 or 100. By the time I actually have the opportunity to go to a Super Bowl or another country, I'll likely have to have a vaccine passport, get a swab shoved deep into my nose (to look for a virus that, according to doomers, is extremely contagious (which means probing the back of your nasal cavity to look for it is overkill) and you're constantly spreading it every time you exhale, even if you're completely healthy and symptom-free), and wear (possibly multiple) masks to fly or attend the game. I apologize for sounding spoiled by saying I've been on 12 cruises and I still want to vacation out-of-country in a stationary place with a group of friends, but in my case, I'm actually willing to <em>earn</em> my way towards reaching these goals.</p>
<p>My parents were invited last month by some of my other family members to go to Punta Cana in May, and I was wanting to go with them, despite the fact that I would have to deal with all the hassle that comes with international air travel these days, including wearing masks and getting Covid-tested, which are things I am <strong>not</strong> fond of and have tried my best to avoid doing the last several months. My current attitude is that if I have the opportunity to travel internationally to a place I have never been and want to go to, I might as well suck it up and wear a mask and get tested to fly (which are things that I am currently ok with doing so long as it means fulfilling a dream of mine) because this is the only opportunity that I will have, because things are about to get a lot worse and restrictive when it comes to travel.</p>
<p>Well, my parents decided to go to Destin, Florida instead, and just drove down there today. I was going to go with them, but I decided to back out for the moment because of my anxiety (but that's another story). That means I'm not going to Punta Cana, which is a place I really want to go someday. And my parents won't let me go by myself with said family members either, despite that I'm 28 years old. Even newlywed couples younger than me go on honeymoons to places like that all the time, and it's just the two of them. In my case, I would be going with a group of family members. Some logic, huh? We have had opportunities to go with friends and family to out-of-country places like that when I was younger, but every time we've been invited, my parents' xenophobic side of them showed, and they declined.</p>
<p>The vaccine is currently the hill I'm willing to die on. I've been aversive to vaccines for the last several years, but the Covid vaccine is totally different, as many of you may know. To me, getting a vaccine that is basically mRNA gene therapy would be the equivalent of being raped; you live with the trauma for the rest of your life (the trauma in this case is knowing that the genetic poison in the vaccine is in your body for the rest of your life and you ultimately caved and took it to appease TPTB because they would literally not let you do anything in life without it).</p></p>
