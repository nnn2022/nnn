        <p>I wish I could laugh at this, but I have seen more than one thread here on reddit where people were posting that they love masks for that reason ("I don't have to be so insecure about my acne, double chin, etc."). And they call us self centered.</p>

        <p>It's ridiculous - feels like huge steps backwards for self-esteem and body positivity. Yes, I get a few pimples. That's NORMAL for young people. Nobody's gonna look at and say, "oh look at that abnormal freak with a tiny spot on her chin!" If, at this time last year, you said that you wore a mask everyday to cover up pimples, people would think you needed psychological help.</p>

        <p>We're going to have a nation of agoraphobes. I used to be so severely agoraphobic that I was almost housebound. I remember being 18 and dry heaving in a ditch a few blocks from my house because I couldn't handle the anxiety of a 10 minute ride to the grocery store. </p>
<p>So my psych gave me sedatives for long car trips and we started working on little outings, just sitting in the car for awhile, then driving around the block, then going up the street for an ice cream. Know what he never recommended? <em>Just staying inside for months on end because it's easy.</em></p>

        <p>This actually happened to me, but in reverse. Having been cooped up inside for three months, I tried to get straight back to normal as I'd been longing to do (I am a member of this community after all!). What happened was I was out with a mate of mine and I ended up having this major panic attack which just sent me into a spiral. I could hardly walk out the door and when I stopped eating they had to put me on these fucking tablets. The difference after that was pretty much night and day though, best thing I ever did. So basically the lockdown made me agoraphobic. </p>
<p>I'm not scared of this virus in the slightest but the effect of this situation on my mind has been more or less the same as those who are. I'm put off by the weirdness of it all, the fucking masks most of all. It's like everyone's in this weird cult, like the brain slugs in Futurama. A lot of people here say they don't mind people wearing masks as long as they don't have to themselves, but I hate both wearing them and seeing them worn.</p>
<p>These fuckers who demanded lockdown made me ill. I hold them personally responsible. They are absolutely beyond selfish, and will have to live with what they've done to me and others like me for years to come. I hope their pretend models, saying they saved millions of lives, help them to sleep at night.</p>

        <p>I got extremely agoraphobic at the last place I lived because it was an apartment with an indoor entrance and you were supposed to wear a mask inside in the hallways. It wasn’t even the mask that bothered me and some people didn’t wear them but I didn’t want people to think I was a doomer and thought they should be wearing them, or for them to hate me as an “anti masker”. It just gave me horrible anxiety and I ended up running in and out of the place as fast as I could. On the day I moved out, I finally met my next door neighbor who didn’t even know I had lived there. She was really nice.</p>
<p>I was never agoraphobic before this whatsoever.</p>

        <p>As someone who struggles with body image and my face, it really is backwards and a huge slap in the face to mental health to normalize hiding yourself as a solution. I caught myself a few times thinking about a wearing mask even if I didn't need, or had put them on before I needed to, so I didn't have to show my face that day. I then realized how fucking sad that is. I've found a new pride now in my face because just showing it is a statement about something I've always cared about (how manipulated the masses really are, and that these "crazy conspiracies" aren't that random and crazy).</p>

        <p>That's terrible, I hope you're doing ok. I've struggled with feeling self-conscious of my body after some experiences with pedos in my early teens. Covering up with clothes is not ideal, but you still look normal. Covering up with a mask just feels insane. I have never been happy with the ways in which media and social media make people feel that their bodies are inadequate (photoshop, filters etc - these bodies are NOT real or healthy) but the mask trend is even worse. It reinforces these negative thinking patterns, "if you feel uncomfortable, hide!" "if you feel ugly, hide!"</p>

        <p>It not only enforces harmful and self defeating thinking in individuals, it takes it a step further. "If other people make you uncomfortable, force them into hiding!", "if other people make you feel insecure, force them to hide their face and body". It is a perverse ripple effect that never stops.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry both of you have had such bad experiences, and I hope that we can go back to normal and get better together very sooon.</p>

        <p>There are many socially acceptable ways we can change our appearance if we want to look different: hair style, shaving, clothing choice, jewellery/accessories, etc. These are generally regarded as socially acceptable, because their purpose is to help you <em>feel more positive about the body that you've got</em>, rather than hiding yourself away because you don't want others looking at you or you have mental issues.</p>

        <p>If anyone needs further proof that these restrictions are little more than thinly veiled excuses to be anti social, here it is.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I don't smile at people if I don't feel like it, and I'm not afraid to show my face while not smiling either. People like that need to own their thoughts and actions instead of trying to make everyone else play along with their mental games.</p>

        <p>No, you see that isn't enough. There are viruses and bacteria that are <em>on</em> and <em>in</em> our bodies. So we all just need to kill ourselves and every living thing on the planet. </p>
<p>I swear it's like none of these imbeciles ever knew that millions of types of pathogens and microbes exist and that we, as living beings, all have microbiomes, or we wouldn't exist at all. It's sad that people were able to reach adulthood without understanding extremely basic science. These are the same imbeciles who constantly jack off about how they listen to and love "science" and how modern and advanced they are, while not understanding anything about science and understanding less about microbes than people in medieval times did.</p>

        <p>I know a better way to prevent pandemics. Let's make social gatherings of two or more people illegal. I'm certain that pandemics experts will unanimously believe that if two people never meet face to face, it will stop the spread of germs. Therefore this should obviously be mandated, or you just hate science.</p>

        <p>I really don't understand shit like this. Even if people were calling for this (they aren't), why would you having to wear a face mask be a violation of your personal freedoms? You people really think that anything that limits your specific lifestyle is fascist tyranny.</p>

        <p>That was 100 years ago, when science was in its infancy. But there's been a lot of research done since then and we now know mask wearing to ward off viruses is merely superstition.</p>

<p>Long before any claims of "the CDC being compromised" were ever made. The doomers believe everything the CDC says, so long as it fits the doomer narrative. If it doesn't fit the narrative, they've been compromised. The mental gymnastics are insane.</p>
