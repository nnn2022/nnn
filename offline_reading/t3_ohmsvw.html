    <strong>Am I The only one that did not expect the new normal?</strong>
    <p><p>I thought that government's response would be the same as it was for swine flu. There will be one week vacation and only advisories - not to travel, avoid gatherings, malls etc. </p>
<p>Honestly I was shocked to hear that from tomorrow we will be in State of emergency and nothing will work. And I thought that it will be temporary. The fucking government promised that it will be two weeks of lockdown and one month of state of emergency. I thought that we will just mobilize the healthcare system to be prepared for an outbreak and it will be over. But it only got worse and the new normal walked away to never return...</p></p>

        <p>Before all of this I wasn't sitting reading news and researching like I have been over the last year and a half. I definitely wasn't thinking our lives are going to be changed forever. I wasn't the kind of person that read about politics or any of it at length. Looking Back Now I'm almost glad I didn't because I would have been anxious and worried like I am now all the time. At least I had some normal life before this. I'm definitely a completely different person than I was in February 2020. I can never go back to that person I was before ever again. I have absolutely no trust in government or medicine or fellow citizens whatsoever. I don't think that's ever going to be restored, and I wasn't 100% trusting to begin with but now I have absolutely zero to negative trust if that's even possible.</p>

        <p>The anxiety and nervousness you experienced are part of cognitive dissonance. It’s a painful experience.</p>
<p>We want to believe we can trust the government, pharmaceuticals, and fellow citizens. History shows us they do not deserve that trust. </p>
<p>My life has remained almost exactly the same because I expected this, I even felt 2020 would be a tipping point because I had followed G20 summits and WEF - I didn’t know Coronavirus specifically but I recognized it immediately.</p>
<p>The silver lining was that I didn’t lose friends or feel alienated because I had already built a support system of like-minded individuals. I didn’t lose a single holiday, dinner party, or game night.</p>
<p>I protested “15 days to Flatten the Curve” because I knew it was a lie - “the science” never supported it. I was lucky because I was already mentally strong: Question the Science, Trust your Intuition.</p>

        <p>Early on I read an article that basically said what they were proposing wouldn't do anything. The article said much stricter, longer lockdowns would be needed to "stop the virus".  I figured they wouldn't want to destroy the economy and would never keep kids out of school for so long so I figured they were doing a couple of weeks for show. So I wasn't surprised when "cases were still high" after the initial lockdown but I was surprised at how much damage they were willing to do.</p>

        <p>On the 8th March 2020, one day before the university closed, I took the train towards the capital city, where I study and was completely oblivious to the whole corona situation. I remember that me and my friend were laughing at some instructions about coughing that were on the train. We just didn't think that anything bad will happen.</p>
<p>On the next day in the afternoon we got the mail, that the school will be closed until 29.3. And my first reaction was: Ok, now we will get two weeks off. The school year will be extended, and I won't be able to see the the Tour de France ITT live on 18 July. That was basically my only concern on that day. I didn't know what will happen next. The day after, when I went back home, I basically left almost all my things at the dorm, as I was expecting to return on 29.3. I could not be more wrong.</p>
