    <strong>Some pro lockdown people says mean things</strong>
    <p><p>Some pro lockdown people from my experience says really mean things. One thing is that they claims they cares about elderlies lives, "overfilled" hospitals, deaths etc., but are too unaware about mental health, education, economy, environment etc. But intentionally saying extreme thing isn't just questionable, but going way too far.</p>
<p>I heard one of the Bents and Berits (lockdown equivalent to Karen) say that They wished one of their colleagues getting severily sick, choked and almost dies - but survives to understand how severe the virus is and how inconsiderate the lockdown skepticals are. The person said They hoped the high death rate and severe symptoms people got would scare people to obey the laws because of safety. To me this doesn't make sense at all.</p>
<p>I've also heard Bents and Berits saying it doesn't matter if they gets the black plague, Ebola or something else because they're all bad. They said it exists better medicines for Ebola and the black plague than COVID19, so in that sense it would've been beneficial if they had to pick. I think it's misinforming since Ebola had 50% deathrate, while COVID19 ca. 0,6%. It can variate from 99,5% - 99,97% survival chance depending on the age group.</p>
<p>I'm fine being a "Karen", like pro lockdown may think I'm. I won't stop being vocal about my concern about mental health, education, economy etc. I'm also fine being vocal about unfair treatment in school. When my teachers stays 4 meters away from their students, I would call them out for not being able to hear what they're saying with the black mask on and for not giving proper education when they refuse using clear one half of the times. I can't hear them or see their lips. I'd much rather be a Karen than a Bent or a Berit. Karen cares about mental health unlike Berit.</p></p>

        <p>Originally Karen had one meaning, but is now used about lockdown and mask skeptics all the time. If they think skeptics are Karen when they're it themselves, we can just claim the label so they can't use it against us. Then they can be pro lockdown Karen (Bent/Berit).</p>

        <p>Luckily I almost never hear it from any of them IRL and only read the insane things they spew online. I make my stance pretty clear and they just refuse to interact with me outside of the internet. It's funny watching them not only do that but going out of their way to avoid me for being human. That's just fine though if there's one good thing I can say in general it's that it's really showing peoples true colors but at the same time on a darker note it's not looking good.</p>

        <p>I sees a lot of them in real life. They're equally visible in real life like online.</p>
<p>Even if they think they had good intentions, it's still questionable to me and I won't agree with them. I won't support the lockdown or what they're saying. I could understand not wanting to go out if it was Ebola, but not for a virus with 99,8% survival chance. A virus with under 3% mortality rate can't really be called for truly dangerous. Ebola had 50% mortality rate in many age groups.</p>

        <p>I remember in the beginning of the pandemic when I was pro-lockdown I came across a vent post with people saying they hope anti maskers literally die. Iâ€™m still not really either pro or anti mask,but at that point I was all for the masks and thought that was a bit extreme. I commented that itâ€™s really awful to wish death on people for not agreeing with you and hot downvoted for it ðŸ™ƒ</p>
