    <strong>Current Madness in Germany</strong>
    <p><p>This Madness has to Stop!!! 
We are closed since November 2020. Current Lockdown ist until 14.02.2021
On 10.02.2021 the info came throught MSM that they add another 3 weeks of lockdown until 07.03.2021
Merkel even wanted a Week more.</p>
<p>We bailed Out Lufthansa Airline for 9 Billion so they can fire 29.000 people. We gave all businesses loans or free Money. But that Money is Not enough so people Just loose their Job or need to Change it. No normal human Received a Penny!
Also new businesses dont get any Money as its based on Last years monthly revenue.</p>
<p>Everything is closed except for groceries!</p>
<p>Angela Merkel says that people should get vaccinated or they "May Not be able to do certain Things others can do"</p>
<p>Her words:
„Ich glaube, wenn wir später sehr vielen Menschen ein Angebot gemacht haben konnten zum Impfen, und dann sagen manche Menschen - wir haben ja keine Impfpflicht - ich möchte nicht geimpft werden, dann muss man vielleicht schon solche Unterschiede machen und sagen: Ok, wer das nicht möchte, der kann vielleicht auch bestimmte Dinge nicht machen.“</p>
<p>We all know whats going to Happen!
Around 03.03. they will extend the Lockdown.
They will make it obligatory to get a vaccine or you won't be able to do this and that.
Maybe for some Things you can pay 50€ for a negative-test. But No normal human can afford to do this regularly.</p>
<p>The extremely sad Thing to me is that there are soooooo many people saying ZeroCovid, more Lockdown, dont Open schools, people are Dying. All this Nonsense.
How can they be so stupid???????????</p>
<p>They now refer to a study (Not Peer Reviewed!) with headlines that state that the Protests in  November against LOCKDOWNS/Coronavirus were Superspreading events. Which is false when you actually read the study!
They looked at towns which offered bus Rides from town X to Demonstration-town Y.
Cities with Bus Ride offerings Had more Coronavirus cases after Those Events than cities without Bus Ride offerings. OH NO SHIT ITS NOT THE BEST IDEA TO SIT TIGHTLY IN A BUS WITH OTHERS! Did someone Just step on the Moon? Could have told you without a study! They frame it Like the Event itself was a huge cough-at-each-other mess which resulted in X more cases.
Besides, there are still people who dont get WHY they demonstrated. They lay Out the narratives that Those demonstrators think Covid is a hoax, they are far right q anon idiots, etc. Etc. You know the narratives! 
They cannot comprehend that people were BACK THEN already tired of all the measures and Prohibitions!</p>
<p>How were they, Up there, able to Divide us so far?
I Always compare it Like this:
We are asking Ourselves how grand-granny and grand-grandpa let Hitler etc. Rise and let all the Things Like the war, with the jews etc. Happen.
BUT WE ARE DOING THE SAME FUCKING THING RIGHT NOW! they will ask us in the Future why didnt we do anything against it??? And when i Tell them we tried they wont believe a Word Out of my mouth and call us cowards!</p>
<p>I'm sick and tired of this Shit!</p>

        <p>My sister works in Germany in a medical field.
Apparently some other person form their clinic attended an anti-covid protest of some sort.
Then all employees were asked to sign a petition that person in question indeed attended a protest and it endangers entire medical field and they personally do not agree etc.
Exactly like in stories my parents told me about life in communism.</p>

        <p>Don't forget now they're pushing for 35 cases/100k people/week. It has always been 50, but everything indicates this number will be reached next week. They've based everything on this magic, non-scientific guestimate, and just before it's reached they changed the rules to another non-scientific number. They don't even try to claim science is behind these numbers anymore... By March, when the number will be around 35, they will come up with yet another number, cause 'how knows how many more dangerous mutations might be lurking around'. Following this argument, who knows which dangerous virus might be hiding somewhere, Germany can simply never open up again. This is madness.</p>
<p>The government fucked up with the vaccines and the people and small business owners are paying the price. Blood is on their hands. I do hope all these career politicians are trialed someday for all the deaths and despair they are causing, but I really doubt this will happen.</p>

        <p>I really wish that this whole goddamn government would resign. All of them, from Merkel on down, are a fucking disgrace. But that will never happen. They will of course stay true to form and blame all of their fuck ups and bad decisions on someone else. Just like van der Leyen did just this week when she deflected her own fuck-ups by attacking the UK.</p>

        <p>I've lived here now for 12 years (currently in Munich) and regret coming here more and more everyday. The government here is a disgrace and, more importantly, dangerous. The media here, both public and "private", is nothing more than a propaganda tool of Merkel, Söder, Lauterbach, and Co. Anyone who publicly criticizes or dissents with the official media/government narrative is immediately labeled as a nazi. The atmosphere is downright oppressive and becoming moreso everyday. I really can't wait until that witch Merkel is finally gone, but the sad truth is that any realistic successor is just another version of her.</p>

        <p>Meh, it isn't a bad country, but I wouldn't call it a good one, either.</p>
<p>Health insurance is a double-edged sword, and an additional burden if you have entrepreneurial plans, which is another thing at which Germany kind of sucks at (it can be good though, see countries such as Taiwan, that have world-class health insurance at a <em>fraction</em> of what you pay here in Germany).</p>
<p>As to your last sentence, I both agree and disagree. Yes, I'm halfway between <em>Bahnhofs-Klatscher</em> and <em>ABSCHIEBEN!!11</em>, I know, it's amazing, but we do exist.</p>

        <p>the people of Germany have a long history of obeying to their respective governments. this has led to some serious shit in the past, but it doesn´t help one bit in the current times. the good news is though: more and more corporations/unions are speaking up against it. the amount of anti-mask/anti-lockdown messages I see, both in private and publicly, is going up. there is hope, don´t give up. I am still optimistic that we will get out of this hole</p>

<p>This is the problem: they'll always associate anti-lockdown protests with the AFD and neo-Nazis and as long as the public believe this, Mutter Merkel will continue to get away with her totalitarianism.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, how are the migrant communities tolerating this? I am surprised that the unionised Mittelstand is going along with this whilst they see their livelihoods obliterated.</p>

<p>Yep, I said back in March 2020 (despite being pro-lockdown then) that this would be abused as an excuse for a wealth transfer several times larger than all the rest in history combined. It's not neo-feudalism, as some have said. If you look at the scale of wealth concentration, it's actually more like the Bronze Age population bottleneck. In 2019 we had lost forty years of (relative) wealth increases. Now we have lost four thousand. And if the people responsible get away with it, we deserve it.</p>

<p>They are getting away with it. All they had to do was keep people distracted with things like Netflix, tabloid "news" provided by a media structure that is nothing more than a propanganda tool, and a boogeyman (Querdenker for example) that will "destroy democracy" if they go unchecked.</p>
