    <strong>Boyfriend is getting the Moderna Vaccine today/vaccine pressure from family</strong>
    <p><p>Don’t feel great about having someone I love dearly and want to spend my life with being a Guinea pig for a mass medical experiment. I tried conveying my concerns to him but ultimately he decided to do it anyway “for the betterment of those around him” and I don’t own him so he’s gonna do what he wants. We’re in our early 20s btw and he’s perfectly healthy. 
Tbf my biggest concerns are about female fertility so that doesn’t affect him personally but still. I’m just praying nothing bad happens to him. </p>
<p>I’ve also been facing pressure from my own family to get vaccinated. My uncle and mom think my concerns are stupid because “we took it and we’re fine”. Pretty rich considering they’re both old so as long as it doesn’t outright kill them it’s “fine”.  All the people on r/ covidvaccinated saying they’ve had their periods come 1-2 weeks early scare me. For the men here, that is a significant symptom that is NOT something to overlook. I’m sick of them harassing me to take a chance on my future fertility.</p></p>

        <p>[a rant to go along with yours] 
Oh girl I feel you. I’m 24 and have 2 kids already but would like 1-2 more. There’s no way I’m risking my fertility or cycle for an experiment. 
The amount of pressure I have faced from friends and family is mounting. The longer I go without taking the more messages I’ve been getting about “why haven’t you gotten it? Why won’t you get it?” 
But when we ask them questions we get called science deniers. Science is literally experimentation and observation, that’s what they are doing with this emergency vaccine. </p>
<p>I’ve tried explaining to them the extensive research I’ve done on the reactions (on the CDC website specifically) and there were hundreds of adverse reaction reports in my age group, for women &amp; in my state. </p>
<p>In mid-July we will cross the 1 year mark of clinical trials, which means within a few short months regular people were ready to volunteer themselves to be at the mercy of these vaccines. Helllll no! </p>
<p>People want their lives back but they don’t realize an adverse reaction could take or ruin their lives as they know it. 
“It’s only a small percent” “they already had pre-existing conditions..” they will say in regards to vaccine reactions but didn’t carry that same energy with covid statistics. </p>
<p>I beat covid, it was mild af. My kids and husband didn’t get it. 
Many of my friends have had hardcore symptoms after getting the vaccine that were worse than my actual bout with the virus. 
So it’s a hard no from me! 
Stay strong 💪🏼</p>

        <p>Yes I just don't understand why young people are taking these vaccines under "emergency authorization" when covid is absolutely not an emergency for us. I thankfully have no problem standing up to my family so I'm good on that front. I feel a little less worried about my bf getting it since he's male and won't be carrying any children, the dangers seem to be worse for women overall. Thanks for the support, glad your kids have a mother with a healthy level of skepticism/critical thinking :)</p>

        <p>I was under the impression that the whole “it doesn’t prevent transmission or infection” was just bogus from people like Fauci wanting to stay in power and control everyone’s lives indefinitely. I mean apparently nearly everyone is vaccinated in Israel so covid is hardly an issue there anymore. But at what cost right? It’s too early to tell.</p>

        <p>Well actually studies in Israel are showing that those vaccinated are more susceptible to variants than those who are not. It will probably take more studies to confirm that. The video I referenced in my comment also goes into asymptomatic spread in which a couple of smart people are saying that that is virtually impossible other than a small window literally hours before you start feeling sick.</p>

        <p>Yeah my guess is they are gaming the terminology. Sometimes I wonder if it all wasn’t just a series of well meaning small lies to get people to be careful enough that it didn’t get too big in case it was very dangerous and they got a ball rolling downhill too fast that they still cannot possibly catch it.</p>

        <p>I saw a post earlier where they were celebrating a child with first passed on antibodies from vaccine. To me this is more of a cause for concern than anything else. If it’s legit it means that we are passing this forward, and that also means if we do see mid or long term issues, those are also getting passed forward.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe the issues arise from having antibodies, I mean you’d get those from a natural infection too. I’m more worried about whatever else is in them. Like a vaccine for a respiratory illness shouldn’t affect the uterus at all, so why are women having these symptoms?</p>

        <p>Look up the video from the ex Pfizer vp he goes into the science on this and it makes sense. The reason that they (Pfizer, etc)are classifying these as vaccines is because you don’t have to perform studies on where the “drug” goes with vaccines because traditional vaccines are just dead cells/virus that are floating around for your immune system to respond to. So they don’t know where the mRNA is going to take hold in the body, it’s random. He explains that this is why there are good chances for clotting, your blood vessels could potentially be the ones that are doing the production of the antibodies so now they are doing a job that they aren’t traditionally supposed to do. So from that I suspect these girls are taking it up in their uterus and it’s causing issues because they are busy producing antibodies. I suspect I may not be explaining it well so I suggest you listen yourself. It is very clear that this man has been jaded by the absurdity he sees around him and he has come to suspect that there are very nefarious influences at work. I’m not sure though as I tend to think the whole don’t attribute to malice what you can to stupidity.</p>

        <p>The mRNA production is temporary though, right? Supposedly it has a short lifespan and is degraded after some time. Meaning as long as he doesn't die he would eventually be fine, right? I definitely agree with the "stupidity over malice" philosophy, I don't believe this is some mass depopulation conspiracy like some here. It seems like more of people sick of the pandemic and jumping at the chance for an end to it all without using critical thinking to balance risk vs reward, and of course big pharma companies jumping at the chance to make millions.</p>

        <p>I have never seen anything about any claims of how long it will last. To say what will happen mid to long term is impossible to know because we haven’t studied it. That’s why I am not taking it. That and I have virtually no risk and I have already had it and beat it in a day. I suspect more will come up when they seek further real FDA approval. Let’s hope the FDA doesn’t give in to politics and proves this new technology out.</p>

        <p>I mean it’s pretty clear to me they aren’t sure on how long the vaccine is supposed to protect you. They have stated 6 months but they have never stated for sure. So to me that tells me they don’t know how long your body will be programmed to produce this. It’s very hard for me to speculate without taking time to look way deep into it and heck anymore you don’t know which experts papers to even look at. There’s only so much of it going into you and any programmed cells are bound to die eventually right so my feeling is it would stop eventually but their hesitancy to give us a firm number on immunity to me says it all...they don’t know for sure. Too many unknowns for my liking.</p>

        <p>You're mistaking mRNA for antibodies in your response. </p>
<p>The mRNA template used to create spike proteins is likely going to degrade (should, at least) within a day.  After that, some of your cells express spike proteins on their MHCs. Passing immune cells will regocnize it and start attacking it, creating antibodies. After some months without any encounter to the protein/pathogen, it's likely that your antibodies will degrade, leaving some T-cells with a certain "memory" of the spike protein/pathogen in place.</p>

        <p>I have no idea. The blood clots are because the body starts producing antibodies to certain parts of your blood platelets and that takes some time, just like with a cold, and then starts attacking the platelets, killing some off, and clumping other together. </p>
<p>Other stuff? I have no clue.</p>

        <p>Not really, because its not the presence or absence of the antibodies at the when youre exposed again that matter. How exactly disease enhancement comes about doesnt seem to be understood, but it has to do with having a sub-optimal immune response, which could be different things; if you launch a good T cell response only you could be ok next time, if you have a good anitbody response of some kind you'd be ok but there is some undefined inbetween that causes problems</p>

From what I’ve read once they pump it into you they don’t know which cells are targeted in the body, I have no idea how they would know that the mRNA isn’t going to hit a fetus. And then we are back to what does this mean long term.</p>

        <p>I was mainly referring to getting the vaccine prior to pregnancy.  I believe getting the shot while pregnant would definitely affect the fetus as well because they share circulation, and this shared vaccination is how all other vaccines behave.</p>

        <p>We know IgGs pass throuth the placenta to the fetus, we don't know (or, well, I don't know) if mRNA passes through it. I would think it doesn't, but then mRNA isn't suppsoed to be out of the mother's cells is it?</p>

        <p>The mRNA is packaged into lipid particles, which can move through circulation and fuse with cell membranes to deliver the contents (mRNA in this case) into the cell.  So there is no reason to think they wouldn't be able to get to the fetus through the circulation and generate some antigen using fetal cells.</p>

        <p>You are so not alone in this. My SO and I are in our late 30's. We're TTC. We had a very loooooong discussion about this recently.  He knows my stance; I will never get this "vaccine".  </p>
<p>The discussion came about when he asked me if I'd leave him if he got it. I told him what I told him before. His decision on this effects him, me, us as a couple, and our future family. I told him I didn't know if I could stay and take care of someone taking this experimental shot (if something goes wrong).  It's a reckless decision. Short and long term effects are unknowns. Maybe out of trials after 2023 but not now especially when we're TTC. </p>
<p>Which led to why this question now. Apparently his family has been giving him shit for not getting it yet. Numerous texts daily about "have you gotten your appt yet", "we're all so worried about you", "I just wanna give you a big hug but can't because you're not vaxxed", etc. </p>
<p>I've told him he needs to tell them to back off. He's an adult and doesn't need mommy dearest to make medical decisions for him. They got it so why does he? They're old and fertllity doesn't  matter. Doomers man. I'm quite happy to never have to see them again. </p>
<p>&rt; conveying my concerns to him but ultimately he decided to do it anyway “for the betterment of those around him”</p>
<p>Your and his fertility affects the both of you and your futures. He's told you he cares more about other people that you and your relationship.  A long talk is needed or quite frankly, a new man, if he's unwilling to take your feelings and concerns into account.</p>

        <p>I understand where you're coming from but this isn't the case with us. I have expressed my skepticism to him but I never have and will not made the vaccine a hard line like it seems you have. Mostly because the fertility concerns seem to only affect women. There's been no reports whatsoever of men having fertility affects, whereas we've already seen women having cycle irregularities, miscarriages, ect. I don't believe it's a secret mass depopulation mission, I just think it hasn't been tested enough.</p>

<p>You do realize these shots are in trials until 2023 right? Effects on fertility are unknown. They won't be known for years. If that's the risk you're willing to accept, then nothing really changes for you right now, does it? Years down the road, that's the unknown. Good luck either way. We're all gonna need it.</p>

        <p>Hello I wanted to chime in. First I will say I don’t think it’s appropriate to encourage you to leave your boyfriend. As you maturely state in your post- it’s his choice if he chooses to participate in this experimental trial. </p>
<p>As for your concerns: know you are not alone. Most of on here have concerns for various reasons but the general point is we are not comfortable participating in an experimental drug trial. We don’t know the long term effects and it’s perfectly reasonable of you to have concerns and questions. There is an ungodly amount of vaccine propaganda out there. If you are a young otherwise healthy woman, your risk of severe Covid is so significantly low, according to the “experts”. So how would this experimental drug, that we don’t know the long term risks of be beneficial to you? I know you realize all of this I am just wanting you to know you aren’t crazy for asking these questions and you shouldn’t be chastised for it.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, my personal view is it should be up to the individual to decide. Not coerced, not forced, not pressured. Holding off to see how this plays out is perfectly sane and reasonable. The “greater good” argument isn’t relevant if one doesn’t have informed consent which none of us do right now. </p>
<p>Regarding your boyfriend- as long as the relationship is healthy and he isn’t pressuring you/the subject doesn’t become a source of serious arguments I would think this would be one of those things to “agree to disagree” on. Perhaps have one final discussion acknowledging the difference of opinion and move on from it.</p>

        <p>It’s too soon to tell. Men don’t carry children or have periods, or any other way to immediately notice something is different/wrong. Unless a man is actively trying to get his partner pregnant, how would he know his fertility has been affected?</p>

        <p>Okay I don’t really appreciate that.  Considering the extreme levels of vaccine propaganda everyone has been inundated with for months now it’s entirely understandable how people can be convinced to get it. Not to mention how negative reports are repressed- even when people are posting about their side affects they always include the obligatory “you should still get the vaccine tho :)”</p>

        <p>I have to get vaccinated because of a metabolic disorder that doctors recommended that I have flu shots every year because I got really sick one year as a kid. So this would be the same...🤬🤬🤬</p>
<p>Worse is when I don’t qualify for early vaccination. If I didn’t live with my parents I would not bother until they fully test it out.</p>
<p>I’m a gamer and this vaccine is like the first batches of new Ps5s in how you wait a year so that the bugs get worked on. They are using us as the beta test.</p>

        <p>Stand your ground, girl. You have every right under the sun to protect your fertility, which is precious and is your birthright as a woman. You don't owe your family a reason or a conversation about it.</p>
<p>I hope your partner isn't affected by the vaccine. But like you said, it's an experiment. This may sound alarmist but I would advise to just make sure that your boyfriend is someone you want to raise children with. This may not be the last of authoritarian-driven hysteria. This may no be the last "pandemic." Will he insist you vaccinate your innocent healthy kiddos the next time everyone is up in arms about the next cold going around and his parents are breathing down his neck? Because that would be a deal breaker for me 100%. To each her own, though.</p>

        <p>Your second point is false. You will not shed any virus upon receiving the vaccine shot. The shot does not contain any information about constructing viruses so it is literally impossible for you to shed them. Your body would not know how, and it has nothing telling it to make them. </p>
<p>You can still potentially shed viral particles if you <em>later</em> become infected with COVID, but you will shed far fewer than you would without the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Yes he's completely healthy and also understands he faces literally no risk from covid. He just doesn't think it's a big deal as long as he doesn't drop dead from it. If vaccinated people are actually more at risk from variants that doesn't concern me a whole lot since he'd still probably be fine.</p>

        <p>There is no way to know what the results of the vaccine will be as we are a year into "testing" (several steps were skipped including nonclinical and toxicity studies, video links provided). Also, at no point is any piece of an actual virus introduced, it is all synthetic... which is why the defintion of vaccine was changed to allow "synthetic substitutes"</p>
