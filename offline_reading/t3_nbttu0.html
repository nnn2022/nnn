    <strong>What This Reminds Me Of...</strong>
    <p><p>Have you ever stood up for anything in your life? What happens when you do that? BLOWBACK...and lots of it. </p>
<p>This whole thing reminds me of various times in my life, where I stood up at work against policies that were ridiculous or unfair. The most recent was a manager asking me what I thought about the new compensation structure? I told him the truth and I was immediately blackballed for giving an honest opinion. Wasn't said in any derogatory fashion, but down came the wrath upon me.</p>
<p>Living in an HOA, they raised our dues by 170 bucks within a year of me moving in. I went to the public HOA meeting, wore a suit, stood up and told them  I didn't buy a house, here, to provide dues welfare to all the non-payers. You see, they raised everyone else's dues because 30% weren't paying. So, instead of collecting on the delinquents, they chose to add 170 bucks worth of dues to everyone who did pay. I got a standing ovation from the attendees, but the HOA then sent me notice after notice about my property to screw with me for making them look bad. All I did was tell them it wasn't my job to pay for freeloaders.</p>
<p>I was once very active and popular in a children's ministry at a church I used to frequent. The head of the children's ministry was resigning and I was all of a sudden fielding tons of questions from curious parents. I told them the truth about his departure. I was all of a sudden anathema...a real danger to kids. This just one week after being told I was sent by God and an incredible blessing to the ministry? What changed? I told the truth? Oh, no! Not the truth...in a church, too? </p>
<p>Now, you tell the truth about this situation and you're banned from social media, shunned by society, looked at sideway from doomer friends if not cut off altogether. </p>
<p>The TRUTH will ALWAYS come with a price. Sometimes it's a cost people can bear and they continue on. Sometimes it's cost they can't and they bow to pressure and cave. </p>
<p>If you start down the path of truth, don't ever stray no matter what the cost. </p>
<p>Truth always triumphs. It can be tough when it all feels like it's going against you, but like the lie that when you take an experimental vaccine and get really sick means that it is working....the truth is you are doing what you should be doing on this earth when you get blowback. There is no other way. This IS the way...  I thank Jesus for it, while you may not...but regardless TRUTH is the way.</p>
<p>EDIT: A late edit... Now, you know why we're in this mess. How many people do you actually know who really stand up for anything anymore? How many comply at work because they need the job and don't want to rock the boat? How many look the other way when they see bad behavior for fear of repercussions if they call it out? We walk, unmasked, among a world of enablers. </p>
<p>The status quo is maintained on the backs of the weak and those who protect themselves. So, who are the truly selfish ones?</p></p>

        <p>Well said. It is this reason why most people are scared to stand up for the truth.</p>

        <p>Excellent post. People pretend to value their "uniqueness" but flash like a fish in a school of sardines out of FEAR. Stand for what is right and show love to encourage those around you to stand for themselves. Opposing viewpoints can be constructive. Conformity leads to this dystopia we are falling into.</p>
