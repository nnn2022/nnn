    <strong>Does anyone have a good compilation of info from reputable sources I can use to study and help red-pill a doomer brother in law?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not trying to be lazy, I just kind of need to cram. Long story short, my sister really trusts me so I’ve been able to open up her eyes about a lot of what’s going on in a broader sense. Her husband, however, is a hardcore doomer, but other than that a really brilliant guy, to be honest. Well, they’re coming to stay with us this week, and my sister has asked if I can help her at least get him to question some of the narrative since she hasn’t had any luck. I’m really hesitant about breaching this topic at all and involving myself in her marriage, but I told her I’d at least have some info on hand to try to defuse the situation when they come to visit and he inevitably asks why I’m not wearing a mask to dinner or whatever. He and I are good friends so I’ll at least be able to talk peacefully about it. </p>
<p>Here’s my concern. Like I said, he’s a brilliant civil engineer, so I’m sure he’s got his ducks in a row as far as whatever sources he’s reading from The Science™️. The last thing I want to do is embarrass myself and my sister by presenting something with fallacies or something mainstream sources are ripping apart while I’ve admittedly put myself into a bit of an echo chamber these last months because I’m sick of the propaganda. Does anyone have a good starting point to help me at least reach a reasonable person?</p></p>
