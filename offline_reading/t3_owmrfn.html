    <strong>Vaccinated more ill or dead</strong>
    <p><p>So I have heard from my parents, first from my dad, that at his work they have done mass vaccination, where they called all employees to vaccinate. My dad and some other colleagues havent gotten the vaccine. Obvious reasons.</p>
<p>So one colleague lost his left eyesight after Astrazeneca. And one has died 1 day after the J&amp;J vaccine.<br>
And what they do at work is they talk like how 'ITS NOT RELATED TO THE VACCINE'. Like wtf?<br>
Another colleague my dad is working in shifts together has started to cough all the time after receiving the second astrazeneca shot. No infos yet about other people. Some are at the place, majority is working from home.  </p>
<p>My mother who works somewhere else, almost everyone got vaccinated with pfizer or moderna. Her colleague has suffered from rashes all over her chest. One other called in sick for 2 weeks. Since then 2 months have passed. The whole office got vaccinated (where bosses are), all of them started to cough in this office recently. </p>
<p>Seriously this is getting alarming now, I think now the real pandemic will start soon. So I think it is wise to keep distance from the vaccinated. I'm also avoiding direct contact like exchange fluids (kissing / sex). What a stupid nightmare!!!!</p></p>

        <p>I think the vaccine shedding goes for about 4 weeks and in that time the recently vaccinated are emitting a giant cloud of aerosol Spike proteins. I worry because my pregnant wife is a barista at Starbucks and they are all super woke about their vaccines and she is around all these newly vaccinated people. I would like her to get out of there</p>

        <p>i try to keep my distanced when indoors. my child is not allowed to visit houses if there are vaccinated parents.</p>
<p>are vaccinated people just going to mass infect each other like we are starting to see. this winter will be bad i'm thinking especially with how unhealthy a majority of people are; and also because so many people were/are scared of germs for so long. so much hand sanitizer among other things.</p>
