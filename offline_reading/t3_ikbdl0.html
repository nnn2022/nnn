        <p>i'm still just shaking with rage from this article and i read it 12+ hours ago. </p>
<p>the new normal sucks and we're all on here fighting it as hard as we can.</p>
<p>i'm... scared because there is no place for extroverts in the new world. we won't be welcome. we won't be necessary. we will be reprogrammed.</p>
<p>when i was in kindergarten, i was a little girl with a lot of energy. i talked with my hands a lot - i still do. i was loud and boisterous and bold.  i was a handful. everything sweet little girls weren't supposed to be. one day, my teacher told me that it was rude to talk with my hands, and if i couldn't talk without them, i should sit on them (!) or simply not say anything at all. i was silent for the rest of the day, i wouldn't tell my mother why i was upset, i wouldn't talk to her. i *literally* didn't know how to talk without my hands. i was five years old, so i sat on my hands silently in my room, like a tiny little asshole. </p>
<p>my father got home and scooped me up in a hug and asked me about my day, and i shook my head no, no, so fiercely that he set me down and cupped my cheeks in his hands, and asked me what's the matter. i learned to talk with my hands from my dad, so i told him under my breath, that my teacher said i wasn't allowed to talk if i couldn't talk without my hands. i cried as i told him, i wept into his shoulder. you could feel the anger rip through him.</p>
<p>and oh, was my father angry. he asked my mother what happened, and she was upset because i hadn't told her, and it bothered her, too, that someone would tell her little girl how she may speak. she had always told me to mind my manners and there i was minding them in the worst way possible. my father was so mad that he hit a kitchen cabinet and cracked the wooden frame. he said that people made fun of him for his last name and talking with his hands when he was a kid too, and i was supposed to be safe, and yet his daughter still wasn't free from whatever stupid restrictions were in place to curb her bed behavior and cool her hot blood.</p>
<p>he went outside and had a beer and a few cigarettes. he came back in and asked me what my teacher said, how she said it, did she say anything to other kids, did she say it in front of other kids? he was shaking with anger that some woman told his daughter how to speak, and that because i used my hands, which apparently made me the "other," she singled me out for punishment and ridicule. i was five. i still remember how much it stung 30+ years later.</p>
<p>my parents talked about it late into the night, my father's hands going faster than his mouth and my mother's whispers fraying, and i felt like the bad guy. why couldn't i just be a good little girl and be quiet and nice and not talk with my hands? why couldn't i just be sweet and silent and agreeable? why did i have to be so challenging, why did i have to be so difficult? why couldn't i just be a good girl?</p>
<p>i still ask myself these questions, sometimes, in the dark when it's quiet and i'm alone with my thoughts, and the shadows come out to taunt me.</p>
<p>my father went into work late the next morning and took me to school. he held my hand and asked me to wait outside while he talked to my teacher. and then he went in and i heard him just... i mean, in the most calm, cool, collected tone i've ever heard him use, tear her a new asshole. tell her that she doesn't get to bully little girls into behaving a certain way. that she can't be mean to me just because my name has a few more vowels and it's hard to pronounce. that she doesn't get to judge the way we express ourselves and our emotions. he said it's unhealthy and unnatural to do such a thing to a child, that it was wrong and cruel and abusive, and it had no place in the classroom. that you can't say that shit to kids, you shouldn't say it to adults, that it's insensitive, and it's mean and it's rude. and maybe she wouldn't be so uptight if she talked with her hands! he said, in no uncertain terms, that if the teacher continued to tell me that i couldn't talk with my hands and silenced me, that he would go after the school system, and he would't rest until i was free to express myself in my own way.</p>
<p>he hugged me and kissed me before he left for work, he told me it would be fine, he told me that she can't take my sunshine, and she's just sad because she doesn't have any of her own. my teacher never said another word to me about the matter. i'm sure she didn't like me or the way i expressed myself, but she shut up.</p>
<p>this "mask up and shut up!" has become very, very personal to me. it's like i'm a five year old kid being publicly shamed for speaking with her hands and having the audacity to be loud, all over again. what the fuck?</p>
<p>is there a place for extroverts in the new normal, or are we just supposed to adapt, or disappear entirely?</p>
<p>these people are just like kindergarten teacher, only now they have a national platform from which they can shame people.</p>
<p>yeah. i'm livid. i pray that my dad doesn't see this, because it will break his stupid kind heart all over again.</p>

        <p>oh my goodness, thank you! i'd like to give him the wholesome seal of approval, he made me the person i am today.</p>
<p>he's always been a kind old soul, a champion of the people. we used to joke that my dad could talk to a wall, or make friends with anyone at a party, but it's true. he just has a way of understanding people and meeting them in their comfort zone, and he's a really good person, goddammit. and he makes my mom nicer, too - sure, she likes gin and she's not one for hugging, but my dad really does bring out her softer, fun side. </p>
<p>my dad is always the first person to apologize, and the last person to make excuses. his stupid inherent goodness would be really annoying if he wasn't so genuine and kind and good. he will literally crack rocks without water. i love him, and i love the woman he raised me to be. i love my mom for her reason, i love my dad for his heart. i can't wait to give him grandkids.</p>
<p>lockdown/house arrest has been really difficult for him, because he's also a Type A, gregarious, loud, bright, boisterous extrovert to the extreme, and he needs human contact to thrive and live. </p>
<p>the first two months he really isolated himself because he's older and he got scared - we all get it. my mom had to work so hard to bring him out of his new shell, and now he refuses to go back in. he's so happy to see his kids and his friends, and he can't wait to go back to work every day. right now he's in once or twice a week. he says he's not worried, he's not even afraid to ride the shuttle bus or train. he says he needs to be in the office with people, it keeps him "fresh," he misses the "youth" - yeah, he is one of <em>those</em> people who actually volunteers to be a mentor. he likes working with the "kids" - "Generation X, the Millennials, the Teletubbies - you know, you guys!" he like, genuinely believes in our potential and the future and thinks we will be just fine, we just need people to believe in us and give us good advice sometimes and not treat us like morons.</p>
<p>he's so cute and nice and sweet and he says so many positive things that it's almost gross. he's like a walking Disney character, barf.</p>
<p>i'll let him know he has another fan :) take care, cascadia.</p>

        <p>The Atlantic has been pushing doomer/new normal propaganda. Now we ned to talk less/more quietly? I wonder if this is a veiled admission that masks may not be that effective (or effective <em>enough</em> in their case). This is just more social control. If masks supposedly blocked the virus, why would it matter how loud I'd talk?</p>

        <p>The Atlantic is clearly running out of other bullshit to write about, seeing as the pandemic is winding down from almost nothing to...nothing.</p>
<p>I am laughing to myself imagining the people who will take this seriously and try to talk less/whisper when out and about.</p>

        <p>I already have trouble hearing people in masks. Muffled whispers would mean I'd not be able to understand anyone, and I only have very mild hearing issues. If this caught on, I cannot even imagine how the hard of hearing would feel.</p>
