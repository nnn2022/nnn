        <p>Even if you are not the only one affected? 98% seems good on paper but, in a population of 1 million people 98% survival rate given normal age and health distribution, is 20,000 dead. Just dead, how is that a fair cost for not taking some precautions for a year or two if that can save those 20,000 lives?</p>

        <p>Regarding vaccines, I would caution you pushing an experimental gene therapy with no long-term safety data on folks. Consider also the following:</p>
<p><strong>British Medical Journal:</strong> </p>
<p>“Will covid-19 vaccines save lives? Current trials aren’t designed to tell us”</p>
<p>“None of the trials currently under way are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths. Nor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4037">https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4037</a></p>
<p><strong>The International Journal of Clinical Practice:</strong></p>
<p>“COVID‐19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may <em>sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated</em>. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, <em>may worsen COVID‐19 disease via antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE)</em>. This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID‐19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials.”</p>
<p>“The risk of ADE in Covid-19 vaccines is non-theoretical and compelling”</p>
<p>“Clinical trials of vaccine candidates have only been designed around immunogenicity as an efficacy end point and <em>have not been designed to capture exposure of subjects to circulating virus after vaccination, which is when ADE/immunopathology is designed to occur</em>. Thus, the absence of ADE evidence in COVID‐19 vaccine data so far does not absolve investigators from disclosing the risk of enhanced disease to vaccine trial participants, and it remains a realistic, non‐theoretical risk to the subjects.”</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijcp.13795">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijcp.13795</a></p>
<p><strong>Vaccine Journal</strong> </p>
<p>“Examples of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis have been documented for infections by members of different virus families. Several mechanisms, many of which still are poorly understood, are at the basis of this phenomenon.”</p>
<p>“Vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi-, corona-, paramyxo-, and lentivirus vaccines.”</p>

<p><strong>Nature Microbiology Journal:</strong> </p>
<p>“Antibody-based drugs and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are being expedited through preclinical and clinical development. Data from the study of SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Previous respiratory syncytial virus and dengue virus vaccine studies revealed <em>human clinical safety risks related to ADE, resulting in failed vaccine trials</em>”</p>
<p>“For non-macrophage tropic respiratory viruses such as RSV and measles, non-neutralizing antibodies have been shown to induce ADE and ERD by forming immune complexes that deposit into airway tissues and activate cytokine and complement pathways, resulting in inflammation, airway obstruction and, in severe cases, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. <em>These prior observations of ADE with RSV and measles have many similarities to known COVID-19 clinical presentations</em>.”</p>

<p>“We are writing to express concern about the use of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vector for a COVID-19 phase 1 vaccine study, and subsequent advanced trials. Over a decade ago, we completed the Step and Phambili phase 2b studies that evaluated an Ad5 vectored HIV-1 vaccine administered in three immunisations for efficacy against HIV-1 acquisition. Both international studies found an <em>increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition among vaccinated men.</em>”</p>

<p><strong>Journal of Virology:</strong> coronavirus vaccine provided incomplete protection in mice and resulted in significant complications</p>
<p>“In addition to the general failure of the DIV or DIV-plus-alum vaccines to elicit protective immunity against heterologous SARS viruses or to provide protection even against homologous viral challenge in aged animals, both the DIV and DIV-plus-alum vaccine formulations result in <em>significantly enhanced immune pathology within the lungs compared to control animals</em>. Although adjuvanted DIV protected young animals from morbidity and mortality following lethal challenges, the heterologous virus, icHC/SZ/61/03-S, induced a lung pathology that was <em>more severe in vaccinated than in unvaccinated mice</em>”</p>
<p>“In each of the experiments conducted here, immunization with the whole inactivated SARS vaccine induced i<em>ncreased inflammatory infiltrates and pulmonary eosinophilia upon subsequent challenge, demonstrating the potential for dangerous clinical complications</em>. This is consistent with two prior studies of vaccine formulations incorporating SARS N, where N-specific immune responses <em>resulted in enhanced eosinophilic immune pathology</em>.”</p>

<p>“Exogenous mRNA is inherently immunostimulatory, as it is recognized by a variety of cell surface, endosomal and cytosolic innate immune receptors. Depending on the therapeutic application, this feature of mRNA could be beneficial or detrimental. It is potentially advantageous for vaccination because in some cases it may provide adjuvant activity to drive dendritic cell (DC) maturation and thus elicit robust T and B cell immune responses. However, innate immune sensing of mRNA has also been associated with the inhibition of antigen expression and may negatively affect the immune response.”</p>
<p>“Potential safety concerns that are likely to be evaluated in future preclinical and clinical studies include local and systemic inflammation, the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components.</p>
<p>“A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity.”</p>
<p>“Another potential safety issue could derive from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination. Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to oedema. Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus [blood clot] formation”</p>

<p>“Besides the mechanism of molecular mimicry, mRNA vaccines may give rise to a cascade of immunological events eventually leading to the aberrant activation of the innate and acquired immune system.”</p>
<p>“Importantly, the up-regulation of these immunological pathways is widely considered to be at the basis of several immune-mediated diseases, especially in genetically predisposed subjects who have an impaired clearance of nucleic acids.”</p>
<p>“Until proven otherwise, the administration of a nucleic acid vaccine may instead put these individuals at risk of unwanted immunological side effects by either sensitizing the PRRs or generating cross-reactive cell clones and antibodies. Moreover, COVID-19 mRNA vaccine might differently stimulate myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), generating an unbalance in the downstream cytokine pathways that play a crucial role in autoimmunity and auto-inflammation”</p>

        <p>As a long time member of this sub, I’d like to thank you for being one of the ones to come in here with a different opinion and be polite with your stuff rather than immediately resort to harassment and vulgarity. Thank you for that</p>

        <p>&rt;I consider myself grounded in science and logic
&rt;
&rt;I don't understand why people would refuse what is proven to save lives such as wearing a mask</p>
<p>r/averageredditor on full display. If you were <em>actually</em> "grounded in science and logic" you would take an hour and read the myriad studies that prove masks have no discernable effect on transmission. </p>
<p>This is not an honest question, you already have your <strong>unscientific opinions</strong> that you are using as a basis to make an emotional plea to make us follow  through with perpetual liberty eroding mandates, NOT laws. So kindly fuck off, we have heard it all and this was a weak attempt at peddling your propaganda to us</p>

        <p>OP, /u/Ok_Garbage_420 is correct, the people who participate in this sub are fucking stupid. As a matter of fact, they are so fucking stupid that they refuse to be a guinea pig for untested and unproven mRNA experimental medical treatments.</p>
<p>The people in this sub are so fucking stupid that they value their bodily autonomy and safety, and have bothered to question the safety of this "vaccine" and mask mandates. It is so outrageous in this sub that every one here has actually questioned the narrative, the "experts" and have begun to fight for their rights, and rights of future generations.</p>
<p>These people in this sub are just that damn fucking stupid that I am proud to be one these fucking stupid people!</p>
