    <strong>Its gotten to the point where people will disregard anything that casts the Vaccine in a negative light. Not only that but they will still get it willingly.</strong>
    <p><p>They will be giving it to their children first chance they get too. It’s insane to me but it is literally what is happening.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that now the Vaccine barely even works. Oh it wears off in 6 months? We will just get a booster. MRNA founder says it’s dangerous? Oh a fact checker said he was a liar. All these fucked up side effects including death? The vaccine saves lives.</p>
<p>It’s bizarre man. I just ran into someone that was once considered a homie. He was talking how he got the vaccine and now anyone who doesn’t get it there life will be a living hell and they deserve it. This fucking guy. I didn’t even try to explain how fucked it is what is happening.</p>
<p>In my opinion we are a couple of months within shit getting absolutely real. It’s going faster than I expected with NYC starting the mandates off. </p>
<p>My state is now thinking of way to mandate the children. This isn’t ok yall. Stay strong out there and don’t drink the water. There is blood in it and b4 these evil fucks are done half of the entire world will have disappeared.</p></p>

        <p>That piece of shit Fauci is pushing hard for full FDA approval. If that happens we are really going to see some mandates.</p>

        <p>Actually, only with VAERS documented adverse effects, if FDA approved it, it would imply such a massive discredit for it,  that I seriously doubt it could possibly happen.</p>

        <p>I already foreseen they would 100% approve it that's why I never use the FDA approval as excuse.</p>
<p>They purposely made VAERS too easy to compromise (any monkey can report an adverse reaction) and did nothing about it so the pro vaxx can discredit it</p>
<p>Vsafe is locked behind vaxxed only (afaik)</p>
<p>It's funny because them actually did nothing against VAERS helped so much that what's left to combat is just social media. The longer the time the easier it is to discredit VAERS because duh, more bad actors means more false reports</p>

        <p>I partially agree, but apart from that you have to consider that currently the official narrative is that vaccines are useless for the 'new strains', so it would be nonsense to mandate these vaccines when - again according to the official narrative - new strains are the prevailing ones.</p>

        <p>Just be patient everyone.</p>
<p>The math is not adding up. They will be eating their foot by the end of the year and scrambling for excuse while attempting to move the goal post. </p>
<p>60% of the population is vaccinated. We have more cases than we had before ANY vaccines. Now I only got my grade 4 math but Something is really fucked here and they wont be able to deny it much longer.</p>
<p>Every single day that passes it looks more and more like 200 million people got a vaccine of something for absolutely no fucking reason lmao.</p>
