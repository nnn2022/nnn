    <strong>One friend of mine thinks it's absolutely okay and sees no problem with vaccinating yourself every year to be allowed to live</strong>
    <p><p>No matter how hard I try to explain him, it seems like I'm talking to a wall. I gave him every single argument I had multiple times, but nothing. He even believes that the death numbers are faked by the governments to make themselves look better, that in reality the deaths are way way higher. I even showed him on Google the total number of cases and deaths related to Covid and he says no way its so little, that they can't be real. I was like "dude, this is literally on the first page on Google when you search anything Covid related". He said "no man, no way its so little. Just 3 millions? It's impossible, maybe just America has 3 millions, but even that seems too little"</p>
<p>And when I started talking about the vaccine, he said that very few cases of blood cloths or deaths were there and there is nothing to worry about. I then asked him why doesn't he apply the same logic to Covid, he said that we are talking here about a virus, vaccines save lives, they always did and why would this vaccine be any different. I told him about the zero liability that all companies that make the vaccines benefit from, how the medium and long term side effects are unknown, he said it was tested and it is safe, this is what everyone says.</p>
<p>And regarding the people who suffered severe side effects from the vaccine he said "well, bad luck I guess".</p>
<p>I swear on my life I am not making this shit up, I wish I did. These people actually exist.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, if he doesn't even show any signs of waking up, I will distance myself from him. Anyway we hang out once every couple of months, so wouldn't be a big loss. I even send him the link to this sub, he just ignored it</p>

        <p>That would be falling into an extreme, and extremes are never healthy for you. Just learn to sort your friends. "friends i watch football with" "friends that i can play games with" "friends that talk about politics" and so on.  Running away is not a solution.</p>
<p>Like Bruce Lee said "Be water", learn to be flexible about things that happen around you, so your life may continue it`s nice course :)</p>

        <p>A year of propaganda and isolation. So unbelievably frustrating. No doubt over a year ago your friend wouldn't have dreamt of saying stuff like this.</p>

        <p>Definitely, but can you even imagine someone actually saying that the numbers literally everyone is showing are faked and that they are way way higher because the governments want to look good and open up as quickly as possible? This one just destroyed me</p>

        <p>I know you seem to care about your friend, but I’m my experience, even close family, people you thought you knew are too far gone. I’ve got people telling me they’ll book my vaccination for me because they care so much about my safety. Too. Far. Gone. Put your energy into yourself.</p>

        <p>Good i wish we still had debilitating diseases like polio just to weed out you dumb duck antivaxers from society. Do you even understand what vaccines have allowed us to accomplish? Child mortality would still be THROUGH THE ROOF.
YOU are the reason we‘ll still need another 100 years to eliminate cancer or land people on mars. You stand in the way of common sense, science and society.</p>

        <p>No, YOU stay in the way of all those you listed. You can wish for us to die as long as you want, the truth is, we will all be all right without your stupid vaccine while in a few years from now, you will probably wish you never took it because of all the potential problems you will have. The media brainwashed you very well stupid pet</p>
