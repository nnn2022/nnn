    <strong>Let's remember how exactly things unfolded. Remembering the shift in narrative helps us hold on to the truth and stay sane in a massive gaslighting campaign</strong>
    <p><p>Okay. I feel like we're being gaslit and that the media is working very hard to trump up irrational fear. One of the first things that made me doubt the lockdowns and extreme measures was the shifting narrative. I remember.</p>
<p>Early March: this thing is terrifying!!!! The Chinese are building emergency hospitals and Wuhan is basically a disaster zone. What's coming at us?! (this was the social media narrative, complete with pics of random Chinese people suffering seizures and all that. Lots of confusion and fear. Politicians, at that time, were unconcerned and local health authorities thought that it'd never get to our country even though it already entered the EU) There were <em>terrifying</em> predictions of the number of dead, including from a well-respected institute.</p>
<p>A bit later on in March: it definitively reached Italy, Europe, and was heading to the Netherlands as well. Slightly later on, that was the point at which the famous ''2 weeks'' started. Social media freaking out, health authorities being like ''let's watch this thing closely'' and politicians implementing measures that, at the time, were widely supported. 2 weeks to buy the hospitals time. The streets were eerily quiet.</p>
<p>Soon after that: The horrible predictions proved to be a bit unrealistic. After all, <em>even with</em> measures, many thousand more would, according to these faulty predictions, already be infected and a large part of that group, dying. They didn't, it didn't happen, and the apocalyptic predictions turned out to be way overestimating the infections and/or loss of life. Even with strong measures in early-mid March, hospitals would already be overwhelmed and the death count over 10,000. The lockdown was extended. Flatten the curve. (at no point during the entire spring would the number come even close to 10,000)</p>
<p>At no point were the hospitals truly overwhelmed. There was a lot of discussion in media about the horrors of hospital triage, though.</p>
<p>And... I don't recall a specific moment for myself, but I noticed the narrative shifted, a different narrative for <em>the same measures.</em> They merely moved the goalposts.</p>
<p>So, I didn't hear anymore terrifying numbers about countless of dead. BUT. It became hospital capacity and flatten the curve. And when all of that that turned out to be a bit underwhelming, it became ''but it's still a shitty disease y'all!'' The original reasoning for those <strong><em>2</em></strong> weeks of lockdown, was that <em>it would buy the hospitals time.</em></p>
<p>NOT ''prevent anyone getting infected''. NOT ''preventing chronic disease''. NOT ''never get hospitals full again''.... <em>but buying them some time.</em> Yet the narrative quietly shifted to ''preventing infections''. Regardless of the group who'd be infected (young people, elderly? who?) or any other metric.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flatten the curve.</em></strong> It <em>got</em> flattened, alright. So as it was flattened, that should be enough, right? Flatten the curve, and resume life again. Yet, that thought again was quietly abandoned. I didn't hear a word about that damned curve again, nor about the fact that far fewer people that expected would need to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>Or, how few people would actually die.</p>
<p>Or, how the curve was flattened, the goal's been achieved, and so we should re-open. Instead, this whole thing lasted 3-4 consecutive months, in which about 6000 people died and whose deaths were attributed to the corona virus. 6000?! That's a very low number when you compare to the number of people who die in a day anyway.</p>
<p>Also, the BLM thing happened, even here. No mass infections, no mass deaths in the following weeks. How could they justify all these measures, then?! But of course that notion got whisked away.</p>
<p>During the summer I'd hoped that they'd investigate the damage and effects of these lockdowns and learn from it. I'd expected them to learn that this virus truly isn't that bad. But despite underwhelming statistics, media and politicians try to instill fear as though <em>after all</em> it <em>somehow</em> turns out to be terrifying, still. I feel like we're being gaslit and I think it's important to stay close to the facts and order of events before we forget them, and before they memory-hole them.</p></p>

        <p>I hope they all wake up: I went to this big gathering and nobody I knew died, let's open up! Really thought that was going to happen after the BLM protests, and to some extent it did but not enough. But hey, that was when trump was in office being the tweeter in chief 24/7, so I'm surprisingly optimistic about the situation in US right now</p>
<p>Edit: Let's all send non-partisan letters to the editor in the next few weeks about how we need to reopen. We can phrase it something like "now that the idiot's gone we can have a sober nonpartisan science-based evaluation of the social costs of lockdowns" etc etc etc</p>

        <p>Rachel Maddow and Don Lemon repeatedly called him a "fascist dictator" and eventually people started actually believing it.  They think that they have been living under authoritarian oppression equivalent to Nazi Germany for the last 4 years, and they think that by trading the orange-flavored 200-year-old senile racist pedophile for the vanilla flavored one, they have somehow been liberated from whatever shackles they imagined themselves to be in.</p>

        <p>OK. I will translate this into English as "Democrats are celebrating that the AP has declared Biden the winner in the election despite legal challenges". </p>
<p>And this is a response to a post on virus shifting narrative in what way?</p>

        <p>1) "NO GATHERING NO GATHERING NO GATHERING!!"  These people screamed bloody murder when people wanted to go to beaches and pools at the beginning of summer, they wanted to shut down Memorial Day and Independence Day parties, they repeatedly called Trump rallies "superspreader events", they have waged war on all forms of live entertainment and cinema because they believe that the gatherings of audiences will be too dangerous.  But now that they are gathering for a "good" reason (we got <em>evil orang man</em> out of office and replaced him with a senile, child-groping, war-mongering, racist, career yes-man!), it's okay and the virus is not a concern.</p>
<p>2) I don't believe that the <em>entire</em> point of all the COVID scaremongering was to enable Harris to steal the election, but there were <em>absolutely</em> political motivations, mainly from the left.  It got to the point where D governors were straight-up blaming him for every COVID case in their state.  Whitmer told Michigan that "if they're sick of masks and lockdowns, vote for Biden" (this is verbatim btw, not a paraphrase).  No more orange man = less need for COVID casedemic bullshit.</p>
<p>3) I'm visiting my parents right now.  Mom has had Clown News Network on in the other room for about 3 hours now.  COVID has not been mentioned once.  This is an absolute 180 on media narrative - they reported on COVID <em>literally</em> non-stop until Election Day, and then they tossed it out like spoilt milk.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, COVID itself is going to keep on doing what viruses do.  I'm not saying that there's going to be any change in the spread of the virus.  But the media narrative is about to undergo a <em>massive</em> shift.  It has already begun.</p>

        <p>Yes thank you for this! It is important to remember how the narratives have shifted through this whole thing.</p>
<p>I also rememeber that in the very beginning, around March, when Covid had supposedly reach the US. They were showing "footage," of the hospitals being overrun and dead bodies supposedly being loaded into Vans because the Morgue was filled up. Also cemeteries couldn't bury the bodies fast enough so they were incinerating the extra bodies . Does anybody else remember the media playing this footage?</p>
