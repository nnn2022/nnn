    <strong>Governments don't need to enforce tyranny. Businesses and mega-corporations will do it for them!</strong>
    <p><p>The list of ridiculous and arbitrary rules to battle the plague apocalypse known as "Covid" gets longer every day. Everyone's ire is directed at the political talking heads they see on TV or the internet.</p>
<p>It's a deflection.</p>
<p>Yes, governments have created the rules. But other than for show, who is proving to be the actual enforcement arm of the new tyranny? Not the army, not the police. At least not at a day to day level. It's <em>Businesses and Corporations.</em></p>
<p>The precedent was already set. Every big corporation, every virtue-signalling "mom and pop" store, Hollywood - all jumped on the "woke" train - proving they were ready enforcers of the globalist orthodoxy. "Go along or be cancelled" is the order of the day.</p>
<p>- The stupid "black themed" BLM support banners on websites (like the Reddit alien mascot being given blackface).</p>
<p>- The constant shoving of "diversity" in our faces on TV shows, websites, and especially, advertising.</p>
<p>- The changing of historical narratives to suit woke agendas.</p>
<p>- Businesses publicly denying access to Trump supporters and officials- solely for their political opinions - and openly bragging about it.</p>
<p>- Corporations funding causes and political movements that are actively opposed by most citizens, but dear to globalist politicians.</p>
<p><em>Given how willing businesses and corporations were to carry the government's water on "woke", it was natural they would do the same for the 'Rona.</em></p>
<p>- So now we see corporate mask propaganda, everywhere. and blatant profiteering in the name of "saving Grandma".</p>
<p>- Businesses are arbitrarily refusing entrance to patrons who legitimately claim mask exemptions that are clearly spelled out in local bylaws.</p>
<p>- Businesses allow harassment of the non-masked by other customers.</p>
<p>- Businesses simply rolled over, threw their customers under the bus, and made no effort to defend themselves, their customers, or their employees. Why? Because they are expecting government (taxpayer) bailouts in return for their compliance.</p>
<p>- Corporations are already preparing to mandate denial of access to the unvaccinated - even though governments haven't even weighed in on this issue yet. They slavishly follow every government Corona diktat claiming they have no choice, but then do this, yelling "REEEEEEE!!! My business, my choice!!!".</p>
<p>Our governments have proven that they are impervious to the wishes of the citizens they purport to represent, other than the last-minute attempts to buy votes on the eve of the election cycle. Businesses and corporations, however, need customers and their money to survive.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most effective method to stop the march of tyranny is the cash box rather than the ballot box.</p></p>

        <p>Governments and big corporations have become like fingers and grip. In this age of corporate welfare, lobbyism, and state contracts, there is no sense trying to differentiate between them.</p>
<p>The most effective method to stop tyranny - in all times and all places - is to not engage with either. Shop local. Pay in cash or barter. Help neighbours. Disable cookies. Farm. Switch off the TV. Tell authorities nothing. Practice virtue. Uphold principles. Starve the beast.</p>

        <p>Libertarians and Conservatives need to start employing like minded people, promote people to boss positions who see the world the right way. Don't socialize or hire socialist, climate change retards or communist/fascist individuals.</p>
<p>The eugenics have been promoting pro socialist, pro mass genocide people to boss positions... Even VC money and other capital outlets for start ups seem to be by ideology now, which is why I believe ideologies are the new religions going forward. One is pro life, pro freedom and free markets, the other is death, destruction and the biggest genocide in mankind history.</p>
<p>Don't worry my friend, the Libertarian minded person is very good at business and producing, generally speaking... We will rise and challenge the deep state controlled companies like Nestle,Visa/MC, Microsoft &amp; Google, etc... We won't defeat them cause some of them are too big to ever get wiped out, but we will have companies to compete with them.</p>
<p>It'll take a decade or two, long after the eugenics lost the war against humanity, but eventually pro freedom pro life companies will challenge and match the eugenics</p>

        <p>This happened to the 4th Amendment years ago. Everything the government isn't allowed to collect from citizens is now collected by corporations and then given to the government via "voluntary" agreements and/or secret unlimited warrants from a secret court. The government was not allowed to maintain a DNA database of all American citizens, but they now have warrantless access to de facto universal DNA searching via private genealogy companies. </p>
<p>This is happening with the 1st Amendment as we speak, with all meaningful public discourse now taking place exclusively on private platforms where it is subject to extensive censorship and manipulation with no legal recourse except "don't speak". </p>
<p>This is happening with the 2nd Amendment, as private companies like Walmart are lobbied into banning "assault ammunition" or pulling guns off shelves completely, and banks and payment processors are being lobbied to monitor transactions, cancel transactions, or deny services to FFLs.</p>
<p>Privatization of tyranny isn't the future, it's already the present.</p>

        <p>This was all inevitable with the creation of what amounts to a permanent political and bureaucratic class, which only promotes and places from within - and who has an incestuous relationship with those who run the megacorporations and NGOs.</p>
<p>It is like a cross between the court eunuchs of ancient China and the J.P. Morgan style robber barons of the 19th Century. It used to exist at a national level (think Rockefellers, Krupp, Power Corporation, etc), but with the march of technology, is now at a global level.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately this is exactly how I've been thinking.  Deep State-controlled corporations use the "it's my private property" excuse to end run laws that hold back the government.  They've done it with freedom of speech (Big Tech censorship), they've done it with masks, they're trying to do it with vaccines.  Public/private partnership makes restrictions on the government irrelevant.</p>

<p>But it's become thunderously obvious these are being used to restructure society in a way that harms us and benefits oligarchs. If you don't want to take my word for it, read the head of the World Economic Forum's own book.</p>

<p>&rt; <em>Almost nothing in your rant has to do with Covid lol.</em> </p>
<p>It <em>all</em> has to do with "Covid" - because Covid is simply yet another vehicle being used to lead the world to Globalism and the "Great Reset". It isn't an end, it's a means to an end.</p>
<p>&rt; <em>Of course but obviously they are pandering to what they have deemed to be the majority.</em> </p>
<p>Poll after poll has stated that the majority are opposed to BLM, "defund the police", open borders, outsourcing, diversity for diversity's sake etc. You are full of it on this one.</p>
<p>&rt;<em>trying to say instituting safety procedures is not defending the workers</em> </p>
<p>You really believe that most workers wanted mandatory masks, reduced hours and a 75% reduction of customer throughput (meaning reduced work hours and pay), closures and lockdowns (meaning <em>no</em> pay), and mandatory vaccinations? You are delusional.</p>
<p>&rt; <em>Good luck. Most people are in favour of the restrictions.</em> </p>
<p>Nonsense. I live a city of 1.4 million. Before the mask mandates, maybe 1% of the population wore a mask in stores and other venues. As soon as the mandates go away, the 99% will happily burn their masks, or throw them in the trash. They are only wearing them because of state coercion. Don't let a bunch of basement-dwellers on Reddit convince you otherwise.</p>

<p>"The majority of Canadians, in every province, want more restrictions"</p>
<p>"The majority either believe that the government “has done a good job, but we need further restrictions (54%),” or the government has not been tough enough and “more restrictions and more enforcement must be put into place (19%).”</p>
<p>So that's 73% wanting MORE restrictions.</p>
<p>"Only 6% believe that the rules and restrictions in place were unnecessary"</p>
