        <p>Masks work, but is less effective after 2 hours and  extremely ineffective after 4 hours.  For a person out for 10 hours, that'd be 5 mask change. Extremely wasteful financially and environmentally.</p>
<p>Even then, intact masks don't protect against aerial COVID, and covid into eyes and ears.</p>
<p>I'm against mask mandatory laws though, because you could have dropped a mask to the ground which can be worse than not wearing at all, and hot weather's basically make masks useless and a suffer to wear.</p>

<p>Places that have a higher flu vaccine intake have higher covid deaths does that mean the flu vaccine is a major cause of those deaths??? </p>
<p>Their could various other reasons for lower deaths such as more zinc or vitamin D in their diet which is proven to lower covid mortality or if those countries have lower obesity or people in the population with co-morbidities it’s dumb to just conclude “it was mask” as theirs no control group to measure it with</p>

<li>A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</li>

        <p>California has the highest mask compliance in the USA. Its 100% indoors and near 100% outdoors. The masks aren't helping in the slightest in California if you haven't heard. Our hardcore lockdown has only delayed the inevitable spread of the virus and masks would have done literally nothing to prevent this.</p>

        <p>Proponents of lockdown had absolutely <strong>ZERO</strong> interest in Japan until masks became this stupid political debate. When Japan was giving non-legally binding advice and continuing as normal, in contrast to much of East Asia and later the rest of the world, absolutely no one cared. This was the same time when all the health advice from the WHO down was against "mask mandates." Then, when the policy switched, suddenly Japan's success is down to alleged high levels of mask compliance. It's totally, bottomlessly ignorant. No one really knows why Japan is doing so well. People just want easy answers. </p>
<p>&rt;Tokyo University professor Tatsuhiko Kodama - who studies how Japanese patients react to the virus - believes Japan may have had Covid before. Not Covid-19, but something similar that could have left behind "historical immunity".</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt; He thinks it is possible a Sars-like virus has circulated in the region before, which may account for the low death rate, not just in Japan, but in much of China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South East Asia.</p>
<p>&rt;This has been met with some scepticism.</p>
<p>&rt;"I am not sure how such a virus could be restricted to Asia," says Professor Kenji Shibuya, director of Public Health at Kings College, London and a former senior adviser to the government.</p>
<p>&rt;Professor Shibuya does not discount the possibility of regional differences in immunity or genetic susceptibility to Covid. But he is suspicious of the idea of a "Factor X" that explains the mortality differences.</p>
<p>&rt;He thinks countries that have done well in the fight against Covid, have done so for the same reason - they succeeded in dramatically reducing transmission.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;Professor Kenji Shibuya thinks the lessons from Japan are not so different from elsewhere: "To me, it was a timing lesson."</p>
<p>&rt;Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered a - non-enforceable - state of emergency on 7 April, asking people to stay at home "if possible".</p>
<p>&rt;"If such measures were delayed, we might have experienced a similar situation like New York or London. The death rate (in Japan) is low.</p>
<p>&rt;"But a recent study by Columbia University suggests that if New York had implemented lockdown measure two weeks earlier, it would have prevented tens of thousands of deaths," Prof Shibuya notes.</p>
<p>&rt;A recent report by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found people with underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, obesity and diabetes are six times more likely to be hospitalised if they get Covid-19 and 12 times more likely to die.</p>
<p>&rt;Japan has the lowest rates of coronary heart disease and obesity in the developed world. Still, scientists insist such vital signs do not explain everything.</p>
<p>&rt;"Those kinds of physical differences may have some effect but I think the other areas are more important. We've learned from Covid that there is no simple explanation for any of the phenomena that we're seeing. It's a lot of factors contributing to the final outcome," says Prof Fukuda.</p>
<p>It is just much more complicated than anyone is really willing to admit.</p>

        <p>So, you mean to tell me that the ones who created the restrictions and lockdowns by using their emergency powers, don't also have the ability to overturn them as easily, using those same emergency powers?</p>
<p>This is the real reason why those lockdowns and restrictions won't go away: Those who have the ability to dissolve their existence, are unwilling to do so, even though they easily can. </p>
<p>This isn't about someone unwilling to wear a face mask. It's really about showing us how much they have allowed their granted powers to corrupt themselves, revealing how much they actually care about the overall well-being of those that they represent, when they have next to nothing, and everything to lose. If they actually cared about the well-being of everyone as much as they claim to, then this wouldn't be about facemasks and cases - it would be more about minimizing its detrimental impacts on society in every way possible, while allowing everyone's life to go on as usual.</p>

        <p>By paying close attention to things, they would see that no matter how many people are wearing face masks, the number of cases will never go down, "for some reason". In other places, the cases do down with limited or a lack of face mask usage. These inconsistencies, are proof that face mask usage isn't the culprit to blame for everything - it's the governments of the people that are to blame for these limitations. </p>
<p>We don't need face masks mandates in order for things to go back to normal. An understanding of civics, will yield the answer that one is looking for...</p>
<p>There are places, such as California, that have the strictest restrictions and face mask usage, where cases are continously going up, contrary to the primary narrative's idea that such measures would cause cases to drop effectively. In other places, such as Florida and South Dakota, that have taken more lenient measures than what's been prescribed by the primary narrative, cases are dropping contrary to its warning that they would go up by using such an approach. </p>
<p>Given these outcomes, it's clear to see that there are governments that actually care about the well-being of their peoples, and governments that don't care about the well-being of their peoples. </p>
<p>Let's face reality: We could ideally have 100-percent face mask usage, and they'll still make up some dumb reason to extend their current limitations, instead of eliminating them. They aren't really interested in mitigating the social and economic damages that their current limitations are doing to society. They are only interested in using, and even abusing, their powers as a means to leverage some form of nonsensical control of everyone's lives.</p>

        <p>&rt;Seriously how stupid is it that people just won’t wear masks so we can all go back to life?</p>
<p>You say that like we definitively 100% would have eradicated this virus by now if an incredibly small percentage of the population would sometimes wear a dirty old piece of cloth over their face. Silliness.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people don't wear masks properly, store them properly, touch them all the time, and/or don't wear a quality of mask that's truly effective.</p>
<p>In addition, as far as Japan, Japan isn't the United States. It always humors me when we're compared to countries that are nothing like us in any sense. It just doesn't work that way. If there was a cure-all for this virus, we'd have gotten rid of it months ago. But there isn't.</p>
<p>Gotta squeeze in that "stupid, ignorant Americans - America so bad" comment in there too.</p>
