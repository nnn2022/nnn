    <strong>No lessons learned; Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, Canada moves to ALERT LEVEL 5 over the fear of spread of new COVID variant which is "more infectious and concerning." Gatherings of more than 5 people prohibited. All schools, recreation, unessential businesses banned for 2 weeks.</strong>
    <p><p>8:30 pm’s NL public health emergency briefing:</p>
<p>“Dr.” Janice fitzgerald goes,</p>
<p>“ The new variant is more infectious. We have seen how rapidly it spreads. This is concerning and serious and we know public health measures work against the virus. Our greatest ally is speed. We therefore have to take and decisive action to reduce the spread of this variant. To that end, I AM ( this gives me the chills) introducing special measures orders across the province which will take us back to ALERT LEVEL 5. This will be re-evaluated in 2 weeks. This is necessary to give public health the time it needs to expand testing and “actively find cases.” This gives us time to plan our response. </p>
<p>I understand this is not welcome news. But we must remember that we have the ability to control the spread of this variant. REMEMBER OUR TRIED-AND-TRUE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES. Keep your contacts as low as possible. Maintain physical distancing. Wash your hands as often as possible. WEAR MASKS. STAY HOME. ARRANGE TESTING. Now is the time for us all to pull together. To be safe and kind. Hold fast, Newfoundland and Labrador. </p>
<p>Media questions!</p>
<p>Q. What would you say to someone who is very scared right now?</p>
<p>A. I think we need to remember ahh… I mean this is concerning there’s no doubt about it. We have seen how quickly this spreads and if we look at the epicurve it’s almost a straight line up right now (lmao what?). And that is concerning and I can’t really sugar coat this for anybody ( really b? not even for anyone under 60??) We have to remember that we have the means to control it. We know public health measures will work against this variant just as they would work against any variant of COVID-19. I think we really need to remember that and stay home and within our bubble and only go out for works and things like that… We know there can be asymptomatic spread of this variant just like any other strain of covid so we wanna find those cases and isolate those people. </p>
<p>Later, a genuine smile escapes through the artificial sadness and appears on her face showing how powerful she must be feeling controlling half a million sheep. </p>
<p>Q. How many new cases of variant?</p>
<p>A. Probably all of the cases we’ve had after 5 Feb. </p>
<p>Replies to someone saying, “hahah, it does feel like 5 years ago.”</p>
<p>Q. What should individuals be doing?</p>
<p>A. “Stay in your bubble” you fucking stupid hooman. Only go out for essentials. Wear your masks. Lolol we didn’t have masks the last time but now we wear our masks. AND HOPEFULLY all these measures will stop the variant from spreading. </p>
<p>ALERT LEVEL 5:</p>
<p>· Gatherings of more than 5 people prohibited. </p>
<p>· Funeral, wakes prohibited.</p>
<p>· Recreation is banned (obviously, you want to play during a pandemic? You grandma killer)</p>
<p>· Private health care clinics are closed. Regional health authorities have postponed or cancelled some health care services. (lmaoo only COVID matters)</p>
<p>· Unessential retail, Hair salons, tattoo salons, cinemas, bars, restaurants for in-person closed.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THIS PLACE???</p>
<p>Only if they could open their eyes and look outside their little bubbles. In India, people are living normally. There's no stigma against not wearing a mask. No one wears it anyways. There are parties in closed venues with people dancing at each other’s shoulders. And millions of farmers are protesting for their livelihoods. There’s no virus because those people have real problems. Not like these snowflakes. Everyone is panicked here. And they are yet again believing everything the government says. As Sir Charles Walker said, “UTTERLY STUPID.”</p>

        <p>No haircuts? Guess everyone is going to look haggard. Unnecessary retail? That’s 80% of it! You can only shop at Walmart now! Goodbye designer and consignment stores. But you can believe rich people will have that Prada connection. No one is buying new cars because you have to test drive it, with the salesman with you.... restaurants are getting killed by it too. Imagine entire industries dying.  Less lobster to fish for because people aren’t eating it in restaurants and at home.... the ripples hit widely</p>

        <p>I literally just listened to Toronto news radio, I think this morning, happily rattle on about how Canada is loosening restrictions. I heard something about restaurants being allowed up to TEN (lolololol) customers for indoor dining. She was going on and on about what could be opened and for how long. What the fuck? I'm so glad I don't live in that country.</p>

        <p>Yeah, in Ontario, there are a few different zones and they're probably talking about the red zone. My area has just been put in the lowest level, the green zone, and it's actually not that bad, almost " normal."</p>

        <p>I'm in a red zone. Not really sure what the means..the rules have changed this time around.</p>
<p>I believe that the media has scared the crap out of so many, that even though, the restrictions are easing (not really), they still won't go out, what a pathetic bunch.</p>

        <p>I looked at the new restrictions for green (and yellow, in case we ended up there), and I didn't see much that was different. The media needs to shut up about these new variants and quit terrifying people. I know most people in my area are happy to reopen and go out but it seems to be different in orange/red/grey zones.</p>

        <p>The media will never shut up, about the stupid variants, the governments own them, and this is their agenda. I would have thought/hoped, by this time more would have clued into into the fact that we're all being played..but nope.</p>
<p>I like how the government, at any time of their choosing, has an ''emergency brake'', where they can lock us down again, which they will, using the new ''variants'', as the reason, while blaming people, for trying to live a somewhat normal life.</p>
