        <p>I posted this link because I believe that there are a lot of parallels to how people are reacting to "who's to blame." In the show trial of the Gang of Four after Mao's death, the most common accusation of the three men, Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, was of hypocritical behavior. These four were the leaders of the country and were having the rug pulled out from under them in 1976. From then on they were the enemy and were the ones who were to be blamed for the past ten years before Mao's death. Another accusation that was often done at the trial was that the Gang of Four was selfish. Lastly, the focus on this group of four individuals is called scapegoating and it is very persuasive. Remember the first video that you watched in which a customer was being refused entry to the store because "no mask."  And you began to see more and more of these videos. The common thread in these videos is to show a certain personality type that is usually disliked, the arrogant and the entitled person. However, if they were to take a video of every single person confronted for not wearing a mask, it would be quite boring, even if they refused. Because these viral videos were shot just at the right person in the right scenario to purport to show a negative trait of all those refusing to wear them. It's a show trial of the 1976 Gang of Four in China.</p>

        <p>Maybe I am too hung up about this but it is fascinating and terrifying at the same time how groups of people can be persuaded.</p>
