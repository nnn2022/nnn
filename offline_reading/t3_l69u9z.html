    <strong>Snitches get stitches...&amp; vaccines apparently.</strong>
    <p><p>Hear me out.</p>
<p>Guess I should preface this by saying that I'm not implying  that every ~~sucker~~ citizen getting this egregiously untested vaccine (https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/covid-vaccine/covid-vaccine-testing) is unable to think critically or is a Jew Hunter.</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong>, as many others in this sub have already mentioned, there is an out of control problem of widespread snitching that's been developing. Here's my perspective ;</p>
<p>I work as an NEMT for a hospital. Think Veyo, but with more fuckery. Now I'm no saint, but I've noticed that many of the RN's, scrubbers, schedulers and even a couple of the doctors love to point fingers. But on an idiotic level.</p>
<p>I won't get into logistics, but virtue signaling is rampant here.</p>
<p>Here's what we as a society know. We know that the more brainwashed someone is, the more apt they are to deny the truth. We know this because the entire government-soaked narrative has been to enforce fear and revoke rights that were, previously, not known to be something that could even be questioned. </p>
<p>I've been observing people (like a creeper) for months and I'm noticing a trend. Sure, fear and the promise of safety play a huge part in all this indoctrination. Promise of protection works. I mean, look at the witness protection program! These people are so afraid of Offender Joe Whoever that they're willing to adopt an entirely new life!! And yet... 
They STILL snitch. Even in fear of a probable fatal retaliation.</p>
<p>Why? My theory, I think many people, when they're truly deep down, bare bones, honest with themselves, ENJOY getting other people into trouble. They like the "dId-i-dO-GoOd daDdY?" adrenaline rush that comes from being a tattletale. I've read before that some prominent figures in our history believe that humans are not generally good natured with good intent, but inherently evil. I don't believe that, but.. </p>
<p>Looking and interacting with predominantly sick people, some of which are extremely bitter about their bad health, on a daily basis for years, I've learned that some people need to spew hatred like they need to breathe. It isn't just coming from a state of despair or jealousy either. I've encountered tons of what I can only describe as hate-driven npcs. As this scamdemic worsens, the number is increasing. Maybe this is a sort of biased example, but it's just my personal experience. </p>
<p>I wanna know how can we fix or cope with this part of ourselves? Who gets to interpret what is good and what is not? If we're really a dark, thoughtless, messed up species, fucking WHY? Why are we like this? </p>
<p>I know a lot of you in this community aren't simps, but we gotta start being more proactive about carefully explaining the costs of telling on people nowadays, <strong>especially</strong>, as it pertains to this great reset (don't capitalize that shite).</p></p>

        <p>You’re making a lot of sense here. People love to control and be controlled. Everyone’s been so into BDSM since 50 shades I feel this is just and extension of that thrill people get with sexualized control narrative. Imo some brainwashing is required to be into being controlled. Seems legit.</p>

        <p>Well, if I understand the intent of your question, then my answer is that I have a pretty sensitive bullshit detector built right in. Plus, I pay taxes. But, serious question gets serious answer. I guess I just welcome the truth. Truth is knowledge. Imho, there is always only one linear truth.</p>

        <p>What do taxes have to do with anything?</p>
<p>and if you were brainwashed, then wouldn't that mean your bullshit detector is meaningless?</p>
<p>If you are brainwashed, how do you actually know what the truth is? Wouldn't you just deny truth because it doesn't fit what you were brainwashed to think and believe?</p>

        <p>I guess you don't. Well, I wouldn't say we're brainwashed since who exactly is brainwashing us? Watch the news for 5 minutes and you'll see what I mean. But I often ask the question "is it <em>me</em> who's wrong?". And I look and think about things and I'm pretty sure it isn't but the thought sometimes creeps in that it <em>could</em> be me who's wrong. I think it's just the effect of being constantly being bombarded by the pro lockdown narrative, or perhaps that it would be easier just to conform and believe that it's all for the best, but the question is asked anyway.</p>
<p>But you ask an interesting question that doesn't have a clear answer anyhow. I suppose it's important to question our own opinion too.</p>

        <p>Yes, you can. It's interesting to think about, and a trap anyone can fall into. Here we supposedly think for ourselves, but is that just our perception, just what we'd like to think? It could be. I try to look at the arguments found here and think about them objectively, and I do find things I don't agree with. But of course I'm initially biased, I <em>want</em> to agree with the argument before I read it, and so will others. So how much thinking for ourselves are we really doing? It's hard to know, but I've definitely seen some herd type mentality here too. So it poses a question - is this a safe space from the insanity of the mainstream narrative or just another echo chamber? My answer is it can be both.</p>
