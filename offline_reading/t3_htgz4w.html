    <strong>Even without a hard lockdown, this is so hard on small business.</strong>
    <p><p>My husband's restaurant has been shut down again because an employee that worked one day last week got a positive test. All employees must wear masks and have been, but what is the point of that if a positive test means they have to do a hard shutdown? They said anyone who worked with them that day has to self isolate for two weeks. Well, it's a small business. That means the almost the entire staff--so it is effectively a shutdown.</p>
<p>He's at work today, closed of course, trying to salvage thousands of dollars of product and hopefully not lose much over the next two weeks. Most produce won't make it, but some things can be frozen. This is the second time he's had to do that--the initial lockdown was bad but they were able to be open for carryout. This time, they are unable to operate at all. I don't know if we will be able to tolerate it a third time.</p>
<p>I'm not starting to lose hope. I have already lost hope.</p></p>

        <p>The mere fact that big corps are seamlessly integrating covid into business as usual (“hey we all have to stay home may as well get Amazon to Pizza Hut your Walmart to keep grandma alive”) is surreal. </p>
<p>... and thats just ok with everyone? Like shouldn’t this be something it would be callus to use as a selling point? </p>
<p>They know exactly what’s happening to self employed and locally owned workers. And it’s the nail on the coffin. It’s the scariest part of this for me. </p>
<p><strong>instead of coming together as a community and relating to our fellows- we are relating to ikea and amazon because we’re all just buddies and they understand</strong></p>
<p>We literally have made corporations into people. Not just by law but by our own preference. Target always agrees with me and makes me feel good. <em>they</em> dont want me to get covid and die like my selfish children do!</p>
<p>My mom doesn’t even talk to her lifelong friends because they have different views about covid. Whose left but the furniture catalogue and talking heads on cable news.</p>

        <p>Yep.</p>
<p>It makes no sense, and is completely stupid. If masks are <strong>that</strong> effective at keeping the virus at bay, then why do we need to do hard shutdowns of businesses like this? Really, can someone explain this to me? If masks aren't "good enough" at reducing/eliminating the spread then what's the point of wearing them at all?</p>

        <p>I would really like to know what the masks are for if not for this exact scenario.</p>
<p>It is incredibly frustrating. They did what was asked of them. The staff member developed a cold and got tested to be responsible. All staff has worked in masks. It's not easy to do that in the kitchen, especially. And they get a half-month shutdown for all this responsibility.</p>

        <p>It's getting harder and harder to not call this a psyop or some other kind of conspiracy. Because, again, nothing they do makes any sense except make life harder for everyone else, cause discord amongst the populace (like the pro- and anti-lockdown arguments), and give the government a symbol of control over the populace.</p>

<p>Read this article, and remember this thing has a survival rate of 99.95 % under 70... Once you finish the article, you will understand it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>The creator of davos and WEF wants global communism, I don't know how you would do it, but killing the private sector under the guise of " covid " and building up global oligopolies is the surest way to accomplish it economically... Big public companies can almost lose money to infinite, rates are so depressed as long as one is willing to pay 5 % interest of their bonds, you'll be flooded with cash. Also public companies are a lot easier to buy into and control then pesky private companies/businesses. </p>
<p>H&amp;R Block drove out most individual personal accountants over time yet their net loss was 129 Million for Q3 2020, they systematically lose money every quarter, for almost a decade now, losses range from 300-500 million a year.</p>
<p>Communism and oligopolies is the future the people behind the covid hoax want</p>

        <p>Because masks are effective only for incidental contact, for example walking past someone at the grocery store. There is simply <strong>no</strong> safe way to share an indoor space for hours at a time. That's why all work, including things like Amazon warehouses and Walmarts, need to be closed.</p>

        <p>Typical moronic comment from another brainless communist.</p>
<p>You haven’t thought through any significant issue in your life. You understand nothing.</p>
<p>The “problem” is fools like you. You’re dangerous, stupid, and destructive. And you’re a dime a dozen.</p>
<p>Man, humanity produces so much garbage. It’s beyond belief.</p>

        <p>Humanity does produce so much garbage, and we'd be better off just paying everyone who produces garbage to just do nothing instead and remove garbage like disposable products and fast food from humanity entirely.</p>

        <p>I feel you and him. I'm afraid to go to the doctor for other (minor) issues because I don't want a forced test to find out I'm assymptommatic and the restaurant I work at is forced to shut down and everyone loses their job again.  The local media blasts "123 Restaurant closes due to employee testing positive" and I'm weary that it will be difficult for these businesses to gain customers back. Even if restaurants are open with no positive tests, people are so weary about going out since now restaurants and bars are being blamed for spreading the virus anyway .</p>

        <p>There is no incentive among most service workers to find out if they have it for exactly this reason. One person has a mild case and everyone lost their job for two weeks. </p>
<p>They left it up to us if he wants to go get tested, because while he worked that night, he's the exec chef and never interacted with the bar staff (where the case was found). Some of the other kitchen staff decided to, so we are waiting to see what the results are. He says he'll do it if the owners ask him to or if some of the other staff come up positive. </p>
<p>Because the business got shut down due to COVID, we had to withdraw our son from summer day camp, which started next week. So I have to inform this poor kid who had done practically nothing with other kids since March that he gets to stay home with me instead.</p>

        <p>I don't believe they'll say that forever. I think people are going to miss a lot of the restaurants and niche bars especially. A couple years from now they're not going to be saying, "I'm so glad my favorite video game themed bar closed down because we saved Grandma!" They're going to be saying, "How did this happen? This is terrible. My neighborhood has been devastated, my favorite businesses are gone."</p>
<p>I'm not saying they're going to accept responsibility for it but yes, it's going to hurt them. They're going to feel the loss. Nobody exists in a vacuum. They're too excited or panicked to register the loss right now, but it will hit them when they calm down.</p>
