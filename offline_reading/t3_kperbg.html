        <p>If you live in California and have five spare minutes, sign the petition to recall Governor Newsom. You can either sign it in person or print it out at home, sign it, and then mail it in. The official website has all the details.</p>
<p>The recall campaign currently has about 900 thousand signatures of the 1.5 million (valid) signatures needed by March 10 to trigger a special election for governor. Politicos anticipate that, if the recall were to be successful, the election would pit somebody in Newsom's orbit against Kevin Faulconer, the Republican former mayor of San Diego.</p>
<p>For you nihilists, let me be frank. Recalling Gavin Newsom will not stop the new normal, and neither will electing Faulconer, who is a moderate and would likely be only incrementally better in terms of COVID policy.</p>
<p>However, a successful recall would be a massive victory for the pro-liberty movement nationwide and would permanently end Newsom's political career. If deep-blue California got rid of its Democrat governor over COVID tyranny, why should any other state put up with this bullshit?</p>

        <p>I have signed and turned in at least 4 full sheets so far. He is a sociopathic piece of shit and is destroying California. If people only knew what human garbage he is. I know a few people who have worked first hand with him and he is hated by almost all of his inner circle and those who know him and is a notorious coke head. Fuck Newsom, hope he gets hit by a bus.</p>

        <p>It won't stop it truly, but it can slow it down and send a strong message to others to rise up and resist the tyranny unfolding wherever they are. It will show that there's still people willing to push back and that's the morale we need now.</p>

        <p>I think they have until the end of March to collect signatures. I lived in that Godforsaken state back when Gray Davis was recalled and we got the Terminator. It was an absolute riot! Too bad Arnold turned out to be a clown!  I should have voted for Gary Coleman LOL!</p>

        <p>&rt;Californians: sign the petition to recall Chairman Newsom. Currently at 900k of 1.5m required signatures!</p>
<p>That's a terrible idea:</p>
<p>The problem we have now worldwide is the believe of the masses of people that they "need" some politician scum who rules them - and allegedly had the "right" to boss them around, extort money from them and generally enslave them in every way.</p>
<p>That's utter nonsense, because no one has the right to rule over anyone else, that's called slavery, and it's extremely pathetic that close to a million people now beg (that's what a "petition" is - begging) to be enslaved (!) by  some other piece of shit, because they <em>think</em> this particular fascist is a bit less of a control freak. If you beg for enslavement you will get it, so stop the fuck begging for enslavement.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;For you nihilists, let me be frank. Recalling Gavin Newsom will not stop  the new normal, and neither will electing Faulconer, who is a moderate  and would likely be only incrementally better in terms of COVID policy.</p>

<p>Blatant and ridiculous strawman, I don't say do nothing at all, what I'm obviously saying is: stop making things worse be openly declaring yourself to be a literal slave.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;than engage in the political process</p>
