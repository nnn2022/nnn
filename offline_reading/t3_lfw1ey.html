    <strong>Culture that wear masks</strong>
    <p><p>How do you feel about other cultures that wore masks before anyone knew about covid? In Korea, China, and Japan for example, people often where masks for many reasons. (1) They are speaking close to someone and they may have bad breath. (2) Bad air quality. (3) Showing that you don't wish to communicate in public (4) As a fashion statement. (5) Not wanting to get others sick if you are sick. (6) You're didn't have time to put on makeup. (7) You're famous and don't want to be recognized. (8) I like to wear them on planes when I sleep because I don't want to sit there with my mouth wide open. (8) Pollen and other allergies.</p>

        <p>They are free to make that choice for themselves. Just like I should be free to choose to not wear a mask. For a couple of those reasons I actually would encourage (not force) people to wear them. If someone actually is sick and showing symptoms and for heavy pollution like with the forest fire smoke we had a few months back.</p>

        <p>I did notice at least less smoke smell on the second layer of mask the first layer. Not by much but it helped. The difference between masking for covid and masking for smoke if that ANY covid getting through defeats the point because just one partical can make someone sick. With smoke the more that gets stopped the better, especially big flakes of ash.</p>

        <p>One particle of SARS-CoV-2 is <em>probably</em> not going to make anyone sick, even the immunocompromised. It’s not clear <em>what</em> the threshold is for a viral load for this particular virus, but we know that it’s more than a single stray envelope of nucleic acids. </p>
<p>When dealing with big flakes of ash, you’ve got some real problems if your body can’t handle that yourself. A healthy human body has mucociliary clearance aided by tracheal and nostril cilia cells, not to mention nostril hair. If we’re talking about children and/or someone with asthma, where these mechanisms may be less effective than the average human adult, fine, but for the average person the large flakes should be trivially taken care of by the body’s innate protection. It really is the smaller particles to be wary of, since the body’s innate immunity can’t deal with it as easily. </p>
<p>Any chance you were wearing an N95? That would absolutely stop smoke particles, especially if you’re able to get it properly fit-tested. Also, even if you were wearing surgical masks and they were helpful, that’s simply anecdotal evidence; you were apparently an outlier against the CDC’s statements that masks don’t help for smoke. This is in contrast to using surgical masks for COVID-19, where the CDC recommends mask wearing officially because it’s as-yet unknown whether masks actually help or not. (Unofficially I’m fairly certain that’s lawyer-speak for “we know it doesn’t help but we don’t want to get sued.”)</p>

        <p>I live in Korea and it's just something everyone does. It's just normalized here and there is no actual conversation here about wearing masks like there is in the West. That aside, if you have allergies like me wearing a mask does help a lot because it stops the pollen from getting up your sinuses and down your throat. I get really stuffy in the morning, during seasonal changes and when I go hiking (sneezing, itchy nose and throat and everything...guh), so I use the Korean brand <a href="https://naroomask.com/product/f-u-plus/">NAROO mask</a> because it's quite breathable and washable. The breathability is key since I walk everywhere and don't drive. I've tried the medical masks, the cheapy black masks that cost like $3, but I find them absolutely stifling.</p>
