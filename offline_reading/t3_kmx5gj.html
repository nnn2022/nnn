    <strong>If a COVID cure exists, there's no excuse for quarantine</strong>
    <p><p>It's not as if HCQ is available over the counter. I've shown this to all of my family members about this and they instantly shut up about vaccines. It's a complete show stopper when you demonstrate that they've discovered a cure for COVID that blocks viruses from entering cells and activating:</p>

<p>I was skeptical about COVID. I still think it's just a cover-up for 5G- just like Forrest Maretty writes that the polio 'virus' was a scam to help the pesticide companies avoid liability for paralyzing millions. At the same time, there's a lot of good that comes about when a 25-year veteran of corporate drug discovery leaves the industry to apply nanoscience to the ayurveda. Believe what you will about the coronavirus (I still think viruses are just exosomal reactions to things like dirty electricity- the first common cold came around in the 1800's) this stuff can apparently cure cancer, extend life (via telomerase creation) and do a bunch of crazy stuff like enable the human body to produce vitamin c endogenously. No wonder it's base material was called "the cure to 8444 disease."</p></p>

        <p>You are a conspiracy theory nutjob. Enough said. Polio actually exists. So does CoVid-19 or more SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Time to move the hell on. I live in an area where there IS NO 5G wireless and my mother and father died from this virus.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry for your loss. Forget about the messenger. I would encourage you to look into NanoSoma if you are interested in avoiding the novel coronavirus or if you know someone who has COVID. C-U-R-E is a four letter word in the medical schools - it gives false hope. However, the proof is there for you to see.</p>
