        <p>They aren’t waking up. </p>
<p>When they develop a vaccine that works, whenever that is, they will again expect everyone to take that to.</p>
<p>They are fighting against the virus buying into the fear mongering, we are fighting for our freedom of choice. </p>
<p>It is however my hope that they would someday wake up, to the corruption of their societies and governments so we can all work together to protect our freedoms and rights.</p>

        <p>It actually felt good reading through some of that thread and seeing many people wake up and start to question shit. Unfortunately, many of them are waking up when it could very well be too late already.</p>

        <p>I keep asking my partner, what are we going to do. I had to quit my last job because I was on the verge of throwing out my back and I cant count on WCB to do the right thing anymore. So I have been jobless the last few months applying to jobs, not sure if I can even work a physical labor job anymore because I just have no faith that someone is going to help me if something happens. All this because I was poisoned with refrigerant and denied medical help for 9 months.</p>
<p>These shots have the same potential heart sensitizing effects as I experienced from the hydrocarbon poisoning. It is terribly insane and selfish to expect me to willfully take this shot. And I mean that. I am not someone who is intimidated easily and no amount of bullying is going to change my mind.  I dont care if a Doctor believes me. Its years on a wait list to find one in nova scotia. They are so overworked and underpaid none of them actually care anymore, if they ever did at all.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have a feeling I wont be able to find a job because I refuse to take the vaccine. My partner however got the vaccine, mainly because they didnt want their coworkers "thinking they were a anti vaxxer or something". Sad when your doing something just because other's expect you to. They have been suffering some issues lately, and we are both worried that it may be due to the vaccine. We are both hoping that it isnt and its just coincidence. Before all of this I was never able to get my partner to fast, but they have been more than willing to try it now.</p>
<p>I asked them, if they require this shot 2-3 times a year, what are you going to do. And we both just keep avoiding the hell out of this question. I likely can find work under the table, probably doing something that puts me at risk because work safety in this place is a joke to begin with. But that is not really a option for my partner.</p>
<p>And I do not want to do anything illegal, I dont. I am certainly not advocating it. But if I have to be vaccinated to work legally, then that is just not going to happen. I really dont care if I end up homeless and living in the woods, it seems preferable to this, honestly.</p>
<p>I think this is the reality alot of people are going to face when it comes time to take the boosters.</p>
<p>And there will be boosters. That is the entire plan, I believe. Wreck everyones natural T cell immunity to corona and make them dependent on the shot. Dont want to be part of the plan or do what your told, then you dont get the shot.</p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>

        <p>I think if you're in here, you can't get in there.</p>
<p>Yeah, dumb thing is, they sound EXACTLY like this sub.... so why isn't their sub getting locked down, threatened, etc.  The comments on their sub and this sub are EXACTLY the same - you can't tell the difference other than the sub name.  Pretty soon, all other subs discussing vaccines, mandates, etc are going to sound like this one.  I guess we're just the smartest of the bunch and saw what was going on from the get go... or at least were highly suspicious.  Takes other people a while to catch on...</p>
<p>They are late to the party, but glad they're starting to come around.</p>

        <p>Today is a good day! The narrative is changing and people can no longer claim unvaccinated are putting them at risk. Next person that flinches and backs away when they hear I’m unvaccinated is getting a lecture on CDC data, I used to just ignore it.</p>
