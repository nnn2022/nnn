        <p>Because asymptomatic people do not spread , more importantly healthy people don't . Also the u.s. govt supply 1/3 of planned parent hood abortions . Are you pro choice ? End of story .</p>

<p>If someone wants us to do something, they need to show the efficacy. We know that masks do something, but we don't know how much impact they actually have. Are we slowing the virus? Are we stopping the virus? How much of a difference does it make? How can we tell if mask wearing is effective, and if it is not, will the order be recinded? If you want us to make this change, is it permanent?  When is it no longer useful? None of this is communicated. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By what right does the governor have to require this? Are there laws in place that allow the governor to do so, and is he/she following them? In some cases, they are not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If masks slow the virus somewhat, is that what we want? Since the virus has followed a similar pattern in every state and country in that it continues to spread until ~25% of the people are infected and then it drops off dramatically, are we not just extending the pain by slowing the virus? Why not keep those known to be susceptible to the virus at home for 6-8 weeks while the healthy go about their lives with minimal risk, reach 25% infection rate and begin careful exposure of those at risk?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the virus has reached 25% where I live, and every state and country that has gotten to that point shows a sharp decline in cases regardless of lockdowns or mask usage, what is mask use accomplishing?</p>

        <p>Even if masks slow the spread, why does the spread need to be slower than it already is? Hospitals are managing just fine. Excess deaths are at a trickle. And that situation does not appear as though it will change any time soon.</p>

        <p>I'll take a mask over a business being shut down or restricted.  Asshole politicians are told that they have to appear to be "doing something", so they're just grabbing at anything.  Some things like masks cost very little and others like overreach with business closings cost a lot.  It's not clear how much masks help, but I'm sure it's enough in some situations to be warranted.  Business closures are a prophylaxis that have no proof of really helping this (what the hell does it matter if a restaurant is at 25, 50, 75, or 100℅?) and cost a hell of a lot more than a mask.</p>

        <p>Back in the day, it was understood that masks, and especially homemade or cloth masks, can do more harm than good by collecting germs and giving people a false sense of security, so that they neglect proven measures like keeping a safe distance from other people when talking to them.  I don't think it was predicted that people would freak out to the point of blaming the unavoidable spread of a respiratory disease solely on the (frequently unsubstantiated) failure to wear masks, but that's also a huge downside of indulging other people's delusions about masks.</p>

<p>I don't it to be easy at all, harder to breath. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not being able to see people's faces is so dehumanizing. No little smiles or frowns to share. Like we're all a bunch of robots. Can't understand some people's speech when muffled by a mask. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reminds people to be afraid of their 
fellow earth dwellers. We're all disease carriers!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm seeing people, even the "vulnerable", abandon social distancing because they think masks really protect them. Maybe (maybe!) it cuts transmission a little, but not enough to abandon other precautions.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's no end date. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is being shoved down our throats by executive decree. I fear for our democratic principles and constutional rights. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks are useless outside. Outdoor transmission is nearly non-existant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidence for asymptomatic transmission is sketchy at best. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Herd immunity looks like the better, faster route past all this. Let's reach it before flu season starts. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So no, it's not an easy or simple thing.</p>
