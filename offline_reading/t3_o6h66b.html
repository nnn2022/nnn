    <strong>For people in the US: Isn't the "New Normal" pretty much over?</strong>
    <p><p>Seeing how much activity there was on this sub made me curious, because at least where I am, the fear around COVID seems to have evaporated. Nobody talks about it anymore, there is no more state of emergency, everything can run at full capacity, and masks aren't required for any restaurants / shops / etc.</p>
<p>I don't intend for this question to sound rude, because I mean it sincerely: Why is there still so much US-based content on here? The "new normal" seems to be gone to me.</p>
<p>Curious about your thoughts!</p></p>
