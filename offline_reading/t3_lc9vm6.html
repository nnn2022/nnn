    <strong>School during lockdowns must be a cheaters paradise, no?</strong>
    <p><p>Just imagining what it's like to be a student during all of this.</p>
<p>I'm 28 so I remember during high school (2007-2010) kids were just starting to become highly proficient at computers, but it still wasn't quite widespread. For every nerd that figured how to get into the cloud system at school and change people's grades, there were ten kids who barely knew their way around MS word. It was a wild west of kids fucking up the computer network just to say they could, and the school having no idea how to fix it. Any new tech like smartboards, maybe 1 in 10 teachers could use efficiently. Some just fucking gave up altogether.</p>
<p>Nowadays though, it's open season. I'm almost envious in a way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom can be configured to just play a looped GIF of you sitting in front of your webcam; teacher has no idea you're not present.</li>
<li>Stuff like Discord or Teamspeak could be used to bullshit with your friends during lectures, or screenshare tests and effectively crowd-source every single assignment</li>
<li>Boomer teachers struggle with simple tasks.</li>
<li>If you don't want to do an assignment, can just bullshit the teacher and say a link is broken, photoshopping all of the evidence and they'd be none the wiser.</li>
<li>Nothing stopping you from gaming the whole fucking day. Run whatever you're playing in a window and just have your controller on your lap. Text chat in-game with your squad. Nobody would know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any younger guys care to elaborate on what school is like? This must be utter chaos? I can't imagine people are genuinely learning anything.</p></p>
