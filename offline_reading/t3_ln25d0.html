    <strong>Why didn't the vaccine trials have a group who just got vitamin supplements and a healthy diet plan? Like the anti depressant trials do?</strong>
    <p><p>When testing anti depressants for effectiveness, they gave each group placebo supplements so they could see if people just needed vitamins to feel less depressed.</p>
<p>Why isn't this done on covid vaccines? Or ANY vaccines in general?</p>
<p>I know why of course, but it's something I thought needed to be out there.</p>
<p>The scientists aren't...stupid, but they are damn obedient and will do anything to keep their jobs, and keep government and their bosses happy.</p></p>

        <p>Normal vaccines don't have vitamin groups. Like anti depressants do. </p>
<p>Normal vaccines don't actually even have a saline placebo vaccine control, they just use an old vaccine as a placebo. Pretty crazy stuff, I couldn't believe it when I found it out</p>

        <p>I can't imagine that they would use vitamins as placebos that might actually improve depression as all the SSRI antidepressants are just barely more effective than placebo... In fact the manufacturers had to hide many studies because they showed that they weren't better than placebo...</p>
<p>In some they used other antidepressants or anticholinergic drugs as placebo because all the SSRI antidepressants have anticholinergic effects like dry mouth, and using a true placebo would enable the researchers and patients to "break blind" and know which group they were in. </p>
<p>Peter C. Gøtzsche documented all this in "Deadly Medicines and Organized Crime" and "Deadly Psychiatry and Organized Denial."</p>
<p>It's a shame what Cochrane became when they started accepting money from Pharma...</p>

        <p>Excuse me? No. They do use saline placebos when they do not have an equivalent true vaccine with a good safety record.</p>
<p>This gene therapy being pushed as a vaccine... they just have ignored or intentionally subverted the usual procedures.</p>

        <p>They don’t use saline placebos, they use previously approved vaccines. There has never been a large scale study of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated kids. The Covid vaccine was one of the first that did use a saline placebo, and of course they are ruining by unblinking people now and offering them the vaccine.</p>

        <p>These are the very first vaccines <em>intended for general use</em> in the United States to have a saline placebo control group.</p>
<p>Gardasil had protocols that called for a saline placebo control group, but the info submitted to FDA stated they used all the inactive ingredients in the vaccine (everything but the antigen and adjuvant) as the placebo for those protocols. </p>
<p>FDA has a page with links to the package inserts for every approved vaccine available in the US.  https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/vaccines-licensed-use-united-states. Look them up.</p>
<p>Also look at the length of the safety tests for the two hepatits B vaccines approved for newborns. (Recombivax HB and Engerix-B) 😲</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Clarified vaccines "intended for general use" in first paragraph, meaning all vaccines recommended by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for the childhood and adult vaccine schedule. Excludes vaccines for special populations (military, international travel, cancer treatment, medical/research personnel with special risks, etc.)</p>

        <p>Indeed. Tiny clinical trials in healthy subjects followed for 4 or 5 days, intended for use in NEWBORNS... </p>
<p>From the PIs:</p>
<p>Energix-B (GlaxoSmithKline)
&rt;In 36 clinical studies, a total of 13,495 doses of ENGERIX-B were administered to <strong>5071 healthy adults and children</strong>   who were initially seronegative for hepatitis B markers, and healthy neonates. </p>
<p>&rt;All subjects were monitored for <strong>4 days</strong> post-administration. Frequency of adverse reactions tended to decrease with successive doses of ENGERIX-B.</p>
<p>&rt;In a clinical trial, 416 adults with type 2 diabetes and 258 control subjects without type 2 diabetes who were seronegative for hepatitis B markers received at least 1 dose of ENGERIX-B. </p>
<p>&rt;Subjects were monitored for solicited adverse reactions for <strong>4 days</strong> following each vaccination. </p>
<p>Recombivax HB (Merck)</p>
<p>&rt;In three clinical studies, 434 doses of RECOMBIVAX HB, 5 mcg, were administered to <strong>147 healthy infants and children</strong> (up to 10 years of age) who were monitored for <strong>5 days</strong> after each dose. </p>
<p>&rt;In a study that compared the three-dose regimen (5 mcg) with the two-dose regimen (10 mcg) of RECOMBIVAX HB in adolescents, the overall frequency of adverse reactions was generally similar.</p>
<p>&rt;In a group of studies, 3258 doses of RECOMBIVAX HB, 10 mcg, were administered to <strong>1252 healthy adults</strong> who were monitored for <strong>5 days</strong> after each dose.</p>

<p>We never have in history. In the USA you’re pretty much just on your own to figure out healthcare $</p>
<p>UK+Canada and other socialist countries every treatment is weighed carefully against cost and benefit. If you’re old or dying they won’t approve much of a treatment for you. </p>

        <p>What if they accidentally find a cure for covid? Then all the plans of selling yearly "vaccine subscriptions" will fail. Right now big pharma is in perfect spot, they sell vaccines for up to $50 a dose to countries all over the world, and as soon as any country goes "hmm, maybe we don't need to buy those anymore", they can spin up the fearmongering machine and turn citizens of that country against the government.</p>

        <p>And related to this... why was the control group of the Oxford vaccine given a meningitis vaccine instead a saline placebo?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;"Only around half the volunteers in the trial are given the actual Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine. The second group are being given an existing licensed vaccine for meningitis."</p>

<p>Could it have been so that the corona vaccine looked better in the data than it would if a true placebo was used. Not an expert but heard that the meningococcal vaccine is one of the most injurious ones out there.</p>
<p>So who knows..</p>

        <p>Here's an interesting and unique example of how control groups can be manipulated to hide adverse events caused by a vaccine.   To my knowledge this scenario has only occurred with the Gardasil vaccine...</p>
<p>Gardasil had <em>two</em> control groups listed in the prescribing information, along with the number of test subjects in each group. </p>
<p>One control group was just the vaccine adjuvant, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAHS). This is a proprietary adjuvant created by Merck, that at the time wasn't in any other vaccine.</p>
<p>The other control group was listed as saline in the study protocols, but the study results submitted to FDA said "carrier solution" was the placebo used. It was described as all the ingredients in the vaccine except the antigen and adjuvant.</p>
<p>The prescribing information includes a section listing adverse events (AEs) that occurred in the clinical trials. It has tables listing the AE, number of test subjects who experienced it and the percentage of test subjects who experienced it.  The column headings include the number of subjects in the group.  For example "vaccine group n=5000" and "control group n=5000"</p>
<p>While two control groups were mentioned earlier there was only one control group column in the tables. The number of test subjects in the conyrol group column heading was equal to the number of test subjects in both control groups... Merck had combined them...</p>
<p>This is suspicious because it is impossible to know how many people in each control group experienced the AE. People started looking for the data for each control group... </p>
<p>A large number of adverse events were systemic autoimmune conditions. However, the percentage of test subjects experiencing them were roughly the same in the vaccine group and control group,  This meant Merck was able to claim they were placebo effect not caused by the vaccine.</p>
<p>Eventually the data for each control group was found...  It was in study results posted to the ClinicalTrials.gov website. The carrier solution group had very few AEs and the adjuvant control group had roughly the same as the vaccine group.</p>
<p>This meant most of the AEs weren't true placebo effects, they were caused by the adjuvant.</p>
<p>There's an excellent book that discusses this in great detail titled <strong>The HPV Vaccine On Trial: Seeking Justice For a Generation Betrayed</strong>.  I highly recommend reading it or listening to the audio book.</p>

        <p>Here is the methodology section of one of the studies in question</p>
<p>&rt;In an ongoing multinational, <strong>placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned</strong> persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.</p>
<p>Here is the study: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577</a></p>
<p>Anyways though, I will still discuss possible reasons for why a study may not have a placebo control group.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.graphpad.com/support/faq/what-is-the-difference-between-ordinal-interval-and-ratio-variables-why-should-i-care/">https://www.graphpad.com/support/faq/what-is-the-difference-between-ordinal-interval-and-ratio-variables-why-should-i-care/</a></p>
<p>This link explains the difference between quantitative and qualitative data. Some variables can be directly measured and result in numbers corresponding to a physical thing(quantitative), and some variables can not be measured directly like emotions, feelings, etc. So why does this matter? Because studies such as antidepressant studies and covid vaccine studies need to measure things differently in order to properly conduct the statistical analysis needed to verify the data.</p>
<p>In antidepressant studies you can measure physical changes in the brain through bloodwork, scans, etc. That aspect of the study can be measured using quantitative data and can not be directly influenced by the study participant. You will get numerical values which are measurable through these means of measurements.</p>
<p>But you can not get quantitative values for feelings and emotions. You can't really measure for happiness or sadness with a ruler. That is why these variables have to be measured through qualitative scales such as surveying with questions which ask you to rate your mood on a scale (ordinal), or assigning values to moods (nominal) such as 1 for happy, 2 for sad, 3 for hungry, etc. This data is then able to be inputted and used for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The reason why the researchers do not tell the participants whether or not they received a placebo or the actual medication is to reduce subconscious or conscious biases in answering these qualitative questions. Even how the person administers the medication can have a measurable effect on the study results, hence why many studies use a double blind methodology for administration. Here is a link which goes a bit more into double blind studies:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-double-blind-study-2795103">https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-double-blind-study-2795103</a></p>
<p>Additionally, the reason why you even need two groups in the first place in some instances is to have a baseline, or control group, against which you can compare the data for the experimental group in which you changed a variable.</p>
<p>Now you may be wondering, if there needs to be two groups (control and experimental) in an experiment or study, then why might a study not have a group that received a placebo?</p>
<p>There are many reasons why a study may not include a control group with a placebo. The measurements for a control can possibly be made before adjusting a variable because the quantitative data gathered from the person pre-intervention could establish a baseline and be the control. So why even go through the hassle of having that extra data there if it adds absolutely no value to study or results? This falls under methodology and will be reviewed by the peer review panel and community as a whole to ensure validity of results. Regardless of if there is a control group or not.</p>
<p>But say there was to be a third group in the vaccine trials. Administering things such vitamins or diet changes to the third group just means that that there is now more data to crunch. If the point of the study is to measure the efficacy of the immune response from the covid vaccine, then data gathered for that third group would be completely irrelevant to the scope of the study itself. I am not suggesting that these things should not be looked into, but simply that these things should be looking into in another study if there are not defined in the objectives, question, etc.</p>
