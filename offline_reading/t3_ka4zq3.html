    <strong>Psyched about the vaccines. Plus some reservations.</strong>
    <p><p>I am psyched about the vaccines that are on the near horizon for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>mRNA based immunization seems like a breakthrough technology that could have some very widespread benefit well beyond this current covid panic. </li>
<li>The speed of development and approval has been astounding.   I sometimes think the breakthrough in bureaucracy is even more impressive than the technical breakthrough.   </li>
</ul>
<p>I have some reservations though.</p>
<ul>
<li>we haven't had a chance to resolve the panic and superstition-driven policies we've had to live through.   Bureaucrats shouldn't assume that "lock everything down until a vaccine is found" is in any way an acceptable response to an infectious disease.   Risk needs to be managed, not hidden from.</li>
<li>I'm wary of infrequent serious side effects and we will only understand those once the vaccinations have been out in the general population for a year or so.  </li>
<li>Edit 1 to add: I share the concern that a lot of people have about rushed testing.   If the speed reflects streamlining pointless bureaucracy that's one thing, but if it's truly inadequate testing that could be a recipe for disaster. </li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I'll be okay with adding a c19 vaccine to my annual seasonal immunization if it still seems effective and safe <em>after it's been out for a while</em> [edit to add:] like at least a year or two.</p>
<p>Edit 2: good discussion points here, thanks.    I strongly believe that having the choice about what to put in your body is a basic fundamental human right.</p></p>

        <p>Dude, you forgot the sarcasm tag (I hope).</p>
<p>&rt; mRNA based immunization seems like a breakthrough technology </p>
<p>- In other words, it's unproven, and you are about to be a test subject. And the pharma companies get off scot free if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>&rt;Risk needs to be managed, not hidden from. </p>
<p>- I agree with you on this one. And that should include me and you being able to decide freely if we want this vaccine or not, without coercion or being threatened with denial of access to daily life.</p>
<p>&rt; I'm wary of infrequent serious side effects </p>
<p>- In other words, once again, we are test subjects. Imagine if an auto maker told you "We skipped the crash tests on this model; we will let the buyers give us that information over a couple of years". That company would go bust in a month. Or be sued out of existence.</p>
<p>You seem to be clear-headed about all of this, but don't say you weren't warned.</p>

        <p>Glad we agree on that. Likewise, I think you should be free to use a rushed, never-before-used, vaccine if you want. It's a huge mistake in my opinion, and seriously puts your health at risk more than the virus actually would, but you should be allowed to do it if you desire.</p>

        <p>There's even been vaccines that got approved after ten years of testing, and still caused injuries and deaths. It can be a bit of a gamble. However, I think the odds of injuries and deaths are less probable with longer testing periods.</p>

        <p>The thalidomide comparison is not the same. In the case of that drug, the people who made thalidomide actively and intentionally hid evidence that it could cause birth defects.</p>
<p>In the case of this vaccine, there are too many eyes watching including some very suspicious people watching for that to be done.</p>

<p>Yes, I know: Too short a time period in usage to know what will happen 10 years down the line!</p>
<p>I remind you of one term: PANDEMIC! With a virus that is literally lethal to 5% of those over 60 who catch it. Strange and uncommon times = strange <br>

        <p>I don't believe that.</p>
<p>- There has not been a successful mRNA vaccine yet. The animal subjects in previous trials <em>died</em> when they were exposed to "wild" virus. Doesn't that make you curious as to why they <em>skipped animal trials</em> on this one?</p>
<p>- There are far too many senior health administrators and politicians with vested (read financial) interest in this vaccine. These are people that will think nothing of zapping your ass with a drone if they feel it is "justified". Do you really think they wouldn't roll the dice on this vaccine?</p>
<p>- A "rushed" vaccine is 3 years. This one is <em>8 months</em>. Really?</p>
<p>The vaccine doesn't even guarantee immunity. It doesn't prevent spread. So what is the point of it? The cost-benefit (unknown quantity vaccine vs 99.7% disease survival rate or higher) doesn't even make sense.</p>

        <p>&rt; In the case of that drug, the people who made thalidomide actively and intentionally hid evidence that it could cause birth defects.</p>
<p>What makes you think the same can't happen here? Did you know that in countries like the US and the UK, the manufacturer of these vaccines has suspended, limited or no liability if their products cause harm? </p>
<p>Even if it's not malevolent, if they mess up, they don't even bear liability... how can you have so much confident in a product under that setup? I love sports cars, but it would be bullshit to give Porsche and Ferrari liability protection against their cars blowing up or brakes going out.</p>
<p>BTW, Pfizer was recently fined over $4.7 billion for false claims act, off-label or unapproved promotion, foreign corrupt practices, with over $103 million for "drug or medical equipment safety violations", as well as over $34 million for unduly influencing public officials (i.e. bribery).</p>
<p>Yeah sounds exactly like someone I'd trust...</p>
<p>&rt; If there was evidence of extreme after-effects, you would have seen them by now.</p>
<p>For these covid vaccines:
- Four vaccine volunteers got Bell's palsy, i.e. temporary facial paralysis [1]
- FDA announced the deaths of two vaccine trial participants [2]</p>
<p>I can keep going, but you get the point.</p>

<p>That's just complete false. That's not the lethality at all, even for that group.</p>

        <p>My personal risk profile and risk tolerance are different from yours (everyone is different).   I think you and everybody has the right to make the choice and I understand your reasoning although my personal preferences differ.</p>
