    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 22/x: Incidence under 10 and falling, temperature rising to 25+°C (°F 77) - and 6 year old children in primary schools get forced to wear masks nonstop for many hours. In the classroom, in the building, even outside during breaks. Officials say: That's fine. No changes.</strong>
    <p><p>In the Rhön-Grabenfeld district in Lower Franconia, everything is actually going very well. The incidence keeps falling and is now at 8,8. The children are allowed to go back to school, summer is approaching. One could think that the mask requirement for elementary school students (but of course for all other students as well) must finally be abolished. But the district government says: No. The masks remain. Not only in the classroom, but also in the hallways of the school buildings and in the school yard during breaks. </p>
<p>Depending on how long their school day is, the children are forced to wear the mask for several hours without a break, the only exception would be the lunchbreak if the children are in a full-time care school. For children who are in full-time care, for example children of families who work, this can then continue from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. How much does the district government have to hate children? And how much must those who vote for the Mask &amp; Lockdown Parties actually hate children? Germany has always had a reputation for treating its children badly. Meanwhile it is simply a fact that no one can deny anymore.</p>
<p>Above all, you have to ask yourself what has to happen in order for this madness to stop? I'm really afraid that unless the courts and judges speak a word of power at some point, it will never end.</p>
