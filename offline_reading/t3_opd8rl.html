    <strong>Considering the vax….</strong>
    <p><p>I’m strongly NNN, but lately I’ve been wondering if I shouldn’t apply some of the same logic toward the vaccine. </p>
<p>By that I mean: I don’t know anyone who’s succumbed to or even been sick with COVID after a year and a half. But on the other hand, no one I know who’s been vaccinated has had any adverse reactions. Even months later. I feel like that’s a decent “wait and see” period. So maybe I should get it so I can say I’m vaxxed and <em>still</em> advocate for NNN principles. </p>
<p>Anyway. Please don’t jump down my throat for this, just kinda wondering what you think.</p></p>

        <p>I got the v** and I stand up for NNN principles. I believe informed consent doesn’t involve fear of losing your income, being barred from doing things, or being threatened. Everyone makes their own choices, and should be allowed to do so. </p>
<p>Also, the c*** is not lethal enough to justify the hysteria and government overreach of power that we are seeing.</p>

        <p>I’m not anti-vaxx, and I’m on the fence regarding the COVID vaccines’ safety.</p>
<p>I refuse to get vaccinated because fuck the government.  None of the pandemic responses were based in fact, and every time we get closer to freedom, they shift the goal post.  It was one dose, then two, and now they’re talking about requiring a third dose and boosters every six months.</p>
<p>After the mask mandates, I was done.  I refuse.</p>

        <p>One point to consider: If you don't get it and change your mind later it will always be there. If you get it now and change your mind, there's nothing you can do. This is coming from someone who got their first dose, had second thoughts and zero bad reactions, and now regrets it. There are other ways to protect yourself from Covid - cruise on over to r/ivermectin if you want to learn more.</p>

        <p>The important thing is informed consent and that you make the decision of your own volition, free of external coercive influences.  "Maybe I should get it so I can say I’m vaxxed" reads to me like you are concerned with the external societal pressures more than your health.</p>
<p>If you think half a year is a long enough period to gauge its safety, then make the decision that is right for you and your life. There is no liability if there are longer term effects, and you will be responsible for the decisions you make. </p>
<p>I appreciate that you recognize that others have the right not to be coerced into making a personal medical decision, and hope you remember that regardless of your own medical choices.</p>

        <p>More family pressures than societal. For example I have a very elderly relative whom I’d like to see before they go to the great beyond. But they want me to be vaxxed first because they’re so frail. </p>
<p>So I’m stuck between “meh I don’t really want it,” and “I’m gonna kick myself if they die and I never got to see them”. Ya know?</p>

        <p>Your life, your choices. However, have you considered just lying to your family? You realize if you do not HAVE Covid, you can't give it to anyone, right? Also that the jab is 'security theater', you can get the jab, get Covid &amp; give it to others.</p>
<p>The great unknown is why the jab will do to you in 6 months, 12 months &amp; 10 years later. All that IS known is that (1) it does NOT prevent Covid &amp; (2) by Israels experiment, even limited reduction of symptoms only lasts a few months. (3) There will be more jabs needed. (4) There is a risk of adverse reaction &amp; death from the jabs. </p>
<p>Not to dissuade you, but a cruel irony would be if you get jabbed to see frail relative &amp; die first.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I wouldn’t. Because there’s really NO long term safety data, and literally no one but you is liable if you take it. That’s what stopped me, the fact that the federal government just gave companies with a bad safety record blanket immunity. That’s pretty shocking.</p>

        <p>People do not talk about their reactions. My mother took it and had problems for 3-4 weeks she did not discuss with me. She mentioned the problems before the second shot because she was worried about it. (Then she found that "some bacter that could have caused the reaction" and took the second shot...)</p>
<p>One person I know is being accepted to hospital due to strong skin reaction.</p>
<p>These are engough for me, but, of course, your mileage may vary.</p>

        <p>I know of 3 very bad reactions to various vaccines in, young, previously healthy individuals in my sphere of influence compared with zero serious covid illnesses so far. The important thing being so far. Covid can only get more transmissible and less pathogenic, if it doesn't it will the first virus ever to in history to do the opposite.</p>

        <p>My 19 yo had an echocardiogram last week. Family doc put her on a beta blocker a couple of weeks ago, "unexplained" tachycardia and hypertension. This kid has no body fat and weighs 100 lbs with zero previous problems. She INSISTED on getting this and I couldn't talk her into considering even potential side effects due to the propaganda re how "safe and effective" it is.</p>
<p>I know now about asking our doc for the d-dimer test, and I stocked up on NAC because it looks like the FDA may be trying to pull it off of the market. I'm grateful for this community.</p>

        <p>Tbh I am grateful that I learned about a lot of things in the five or six years leading up to this. By the time people started falling over and twitching in wuhan I knew we were going to be heading into something. It was that obvious. I actually sat my wife down in February 2020 and told her she needed to think hard about whether she would take a vaccine. She thought I was mad at that stage because we weren't even in a pandemic. Everyday brings more ramped up propaganda, hypnosis and mind control techniques, which I am impervious to. This is now a game.</p>

        <p>Same thing here.  Don't know of anyone personally who died of covid nor anyone  who died of the jab.</p>
<p>I do personally know people who've had covid and all are fine. Friends who are really fat, unhealthy,  and sickly did just as fine as my fit friends.</p>
<p>That being said, I'm not considering the jab, mainly because I don't need it.</p>
<p>The other reason is that I don't know how dangerous it is, if at all, but the significant double standard being used when people die from the vax is mind boggling. 3 years before the measles vaccine was widely distributed, two people out of every million would die from the measles.  This was a reason to vaccinate every living person? Because on average two people died out of every million?  Then On the cdc's own website they state that anaphylaxis only affects 2 to 6 people per million and they like to use the term "rare" a lot to continue to get people to vax.</p>

        <p>It's a matter of principle at this point. Like sure, you are 99% certain to not have any issues from the vax, but the same goes for COVID, and day after day more data comes out that backs us up. Unfortunately, the vortex of stupidity is focused on what the media wants them to be focused on: blaming anti-vaxxers for everything, and coercing the vaccines on people.</p>

        <p>Anecdotally, I know more people who’ve gotten really sick from the vaccine whereas everyone I’ve known who had covid was fine overall…</p>
<p>I think most people here won’t judge you for getting vaccinated, but I do have to ask, why at this point? It almost made more sense to do it months ago when the promise of things going back to normal seemed more likely. It’s quite clear now that the vaccines aren’t really going to change much for you. There’s always going to be people who won’t take it, and they’re going to use that as an excuse for more lockdowns, mask mandates, etc. But if you think it’ll make your life easier for whatever reason, then giver.</p>

        <p>If I were to ever get the vax, which I do not plan to ever, it would be because society is becoming unaccessible for those who don’t get it. I wouldn’t kid myself saying it would be for my safety or others. </p>
<p>I’d be willing to bet most people get it for convenience purposes and being able to keep their job, education, or travel. And quite frankly, that just speaks to how ass backwards all of this is. It’s not for safety. Never was and never will be</p>
