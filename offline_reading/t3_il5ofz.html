    <strong>Quelle Suprise: "The Winnowing" at America's Grocery Stores</strong>
    <p><p>oh no! it looks like someone at the Washington Post finally left their home for the fist time in six months and ventured out to the grocery store like a common peasant, only to discover what the rest of us have been seeing since March: the grocery store sucks now!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/01/grocery-shopping-coronavirus-impact/">"Bigger Hauls. Fewer Choices": How the Pandemic Changed Our Grocery Shopping Habits FOREVER</a></p>
<p>&rt;A permanent shift toward online shopping means less innovation, fewer new brands and, for some people who lack choices, reinforcement of unhealthy eating patterns.</p>
<p>lollllll, no shit, Sherlock. COMMUNISM SUCKS.</p>
<p>"The Winnowing" is called a “Sovietish” reduction of choice by an "expert." for once, i'm inclined to agree. i've been trying to cancel my free trial of socialism since April and i can't get through to a representative and i gotta say, the customer service sucks almost much as the selection.</p>
<p>the "experts" are surprised to see fewer brands and less selection on the shelves, higher prices, more processed/shelf stable foods, and less innovation and brand creativity (whatever the fuck that means?).</p>
<p>well, i'm really sorry that this poor, suffering journalist had to write this article and hob-nob with us commoners. thank u for ur service. how very kind and generous of you.</p>
<p>the best part of this entire article is that it glosses over how truly miserable grocery shopping in-person has become and completely ignores the fact that most cleaning supplies are still entirely out of stock.</p>
<p>ALSO, IT DIDN'T MENTION WHERE I CAN ACTUALLY FIND DECENT T-PONS, WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON I READ THE ENTIRE ARTICLE.</p></p>

        <p>Really? I haven’t noticed much of a difference.  Sure back in March there was all those selfish people hoarding all the toilet paper  (mostly the ones who scream at people to wear a mask and stay home were the ones doing the hoarding)</p>
<p>Yes there are still some things like you mentioned cleaning supplies that are out but that’s thanks to all the hoarding earlier and companies making product for hospitals first before they move on to the consumer ones.</p>

        <p>if i've seen any cleaning supplies in the DC area since last winter, once they've even come back to the shelves, everything is off-brand. like, brands i've never even heard of. and most stores are still limiting purchases of cleaning supplies and paper products to one or two per customer per trip.</p>
<p>tl;dr i became an online cleaning supply shopping hoarder and it feels great. i have enough cleaning supplies for 12-18 months. </p>
<p>but i've never hoarded anything from a store, i don't pitch a fit when items are limited for purchase or out of stock, and i never scream at anyone to wear a mask because i still believe it's a choice. lots of selfish people are out there. i just spoiled myself online because i have always liked having a clean house.</p>

<p>Yep, and everyone was <em>packed</em> into the stores in March/April and <em>no one</em> was wearing a mask at the time.  Now, those same people care so much about masks.</p>
<p>If everyone was shopping back then without masks they should all be dead now, right?</p>

        <p>i'll never understand why TP was the first thing that people worried about, when this virus isn't the sort of virus that makes you live on a toilet for several days on end. it's not like we were going to be trapped in our homes for months on end by snow or rain. smh.</p>

        <p>&rt;reinforcement of unhealthy eating patterns.</p>
<p>The forever-lockdown people who claim to "care" so much haven't cared about keeping a healthy diet at all.  They just tell everyone to "suck it up" and eat heavily-processed food and delivery food.</p>
<p>They never talk about how a good diet, regular exercise and sunlight are good for the immune system.  It's all just hide away in your house until a magical vaccine is injected into their arm.</p>

        <p>The biggest thing I've noticed at the grocery store is the astronomical price of beef. Good steaks now easily exceed the cost of farm raised salmon and other formerly expensive seafood.</p>

        <p>Haven’t had any issues in Arizona. The beauty of an ever expanding city is that when things were in short supply in downtown Phoenix in March and April, I just drove 30-40 mins East or west and went to more low volume stores and could find what I needed. Now it’s stocked well everywhere and people seem to be grocery shopping for leisure reasons again.</p>

        <p>Prices have gone up at my local grocery stores, and they will be randomly out of stock of a different random thing every week. Like one week it will be canned green beans, the next potatoes, the next there will be only one brand of toilet paper. It isn’t long lasting anymore for any one product, but it’s annoying.</p>
