    <strong>Are vaccines safe for people with several mental illnesses?</strong>
    <p><p>I've read some scientific papers and most of them display fearmongering comments like people who have mental illnesses are in severe danger when catching covid (no one seemed to care about us before though) and how vaccines will work despite taking a lot of different meds and are supposed to cause "few side effects". However you still have to inform your GP. That would probably be useless, since the doctor is going to go like "vaccine! It is safe!". I'm 28 years old, and the vaccination date for people my age is soon, and I'm kind of scared. I know I can refuse, but probably in Spain you won't be able to do anything if you don't take it. My friend, who takes more or less the same meds, had a rough time with Moderna. Couldn't move her arm right for three or more days, and she had a fever and her whole body hurt. I don't know what brand are they going to inject me with but I'm still terrified, since some people did share they experienced some mood changes after Pfizer. Any of you have another source or article so I can be more informed? Anyone else in my situation? What do you think about this?</p>
<p>btw sorry if there are mistakes in the post, English is not my mother tongue</p></p>

        <p>Ask a doctor you trust or something. Don’t ask the internet lol. People that agree with it will say yes and people that don’t will say no. Either way nether are qualified or in the job.</p>

        <p>I agree, I'm just asking if any of you are feeling the same way or if you have read any sources, or just your opinion on this. I'm not going to do what the internet says. But I do want to read your opinions.</p>

        <p>Rule 5 or this post will vanish.</p>
<p>I question your premise as well as what type of responses you would expect from a sub whose main scope is giving a forum for skepticism over something that leaders are obviously not coming clean about.</p>
<p>Most of us are not scientists or health professionals so the responses furnished by any of us (including me) will be opinion as opposed to hard fact.</p>

        <p>Understood... your wording could be a little different to reflect that.</p>
<p>Disagreement itself is a good thing as it fosters dialog where all parties stand to learn something.</p>
<p>Your post has been removed though- you didn't flair it (rule 5)</p>
