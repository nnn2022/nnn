    <strong>Just a Memory</strong>
    <p><p>Since this whole thing started from China, I would like to share an experience that I had. Although most of my memories of China were heartfelt and golden. However, because of so much change in society the past year, bad memories from the three months in the summer of ‘93 keep coming into my dreams. 
I was coming back from class and as soon as I went past the front desk at my dormitory, the woman got my attention and told me that I had a package. Unfortunately, she said that the postal worker forgot to leave the postal slip so I could claim my package at the post office. It was probably some odds and ends I knew my parents were sending, but it was exciting. Since I had three hours until my mealtime, I thought that it would be a perfect opportunity to go for the half mile walk to the post office in town and show them my identification so they could retrieve my package. 
And it would be so exciting to have a good reason to be at one of the busiest places in town. I could find out how they could organize such a daunting organizational feat for such a large, populated area. As I walked into town, I felt excited and nervous. I got the requisite children and adults calling out “wei guo ren” as they were riding home on the bikes, which always bothered me a bit. 
As I went into the post office, I was surprised that there was only one person ahead of me. However, when I came in, this customer stepped aside and motioned me to come forward. 
This is so long ago, but I think that I remember trying to tell her that I had a package in Mandarin, but she quickly told me that she spoke English. 
So I told her in English that I was told that a postal worker tried to deliver me a package at the foreign student dormitory Nankai University. I began to get out my identification, but she asked me to produce the postal slip. She told me that she was unable to do anything without that postal slip, so I thanked her and went to leave. 
When I touched the door to leave, two women who were socializing there tried to get my attention. They told me to come back to the customer service counter because the postal manager wanted to speak to me. The woman who got my attention told me that it is very important to listen and not speak. 
So, trying my best, I listened to this older man nearing his fifties, as he got very upset and loud. For me, having taken two years of Chinese, it was embarrassing not to understand him fully. However, some of the words he said made me feel embarrassed to expect to get a package without the required postal slip. “You Americans have it so easy. Just show up at the post office and expect them to find a package among 500 packages!” Then he started using some epithets and words that I could not understand. But the two ladies were laughing and nodding. This went on for five minutes. After he finished, he asked the woman to speak to me and to ask me if I could make a statement. For which I said,” I am very sorry I came here without my postal slip. I will never do it again.” For some reason, this response enraged him even more and he threw up his hands in disgust. I don’t remember what happened next, but I did hurry out of there after that. 
After all these years,these memories come back to me from time to time, but I will always be fond of China and the people. However, this postal manager’s mindset is more common worldwide since the “Pandemic,” which I never thought would occur in my lifetime.</p></p>
