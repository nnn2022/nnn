        <p>I don't know which country you are from but It's precisely people's duty to disobey these dictates that are destroying people's human rights and acting far beyond their authority. None of their dictates have any legitimacy. Misinformation? Who gets to decide what constitutes misinformation? Why should anyone get to dictate what the people see and what information is right or wrong? Orwell wrote a book about this for a reason.</p>

        <p>Every covid measure is an invasion of people‚Äôs constitutional rights ‚Äì they‚Äôve completely gutted the first amendment by forcing churches to close down (freedom of religion) and right to assemble through arbitrary restrictions on the number of people who can gather. Even forcing people to wear masks in public spaces profoundly violates freedom of expression. Living in NY where they have some of the toughest restrictions in the country I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain it.

        <p>&rt;forcing churches to close down (freedom of religion) and right to assemble through arbitrary restrictions on the number of people who can gather.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I go to church and people wear masks just fine. In New york, certain areas are designated red, orange, or yellow and have to act accordingly which I'm sure you know. I do think it is the age of the internet, if we can talk just fine here, why not do service over video? In my opinion that is a decent alternative if need be.</p>
<p>&rt;forcing people to wear masks in public spaces</p>
<p>I mean, if you go to a store or restaurant employees have the right to deny you service if you don't follow their rules. Just like Twitter or Facebook or Reddit can for violating the terms of service. I personally don't think wearing a mask is a big deal, or an invasion of personal rights. If you can't wear one, you can do delivery for some services. I worked at Stewart's over break from college and I tell people that I know it sucks but we could get fined, and it would help if you just wear it while in the store. Once outside, go throw it out, curse, or whatever but when you are in a public space around other people, this is to help protect them, and they are protecting you by wearing one so you could at least be courteous.</p>
<p>...sorry I got on a tangent about the masks specifically. My opinion is just different than yours.</p>

        <p>But businesses do not have the right to decide if people should or should not wear masks into their store/restaurant, or if their employees need to wear masks. The government has dictated that everyone must wear masks. ‚ÄúBusinesses can do what they want‚Äù is actually ‚Äúbusinesses must follow these ridiculous mandates they had no say in in order to remain open at the mandated capacity level‚Äù.</p>

        <p>What harm does wearing a mask have with going shopping do? If you will just be in there for maybe 5-30 minutes it's not going to kill you. As I've heard many times before, "if you don't like it then leave"; no one is forcing you to go to that store. I just don't understand how masks have become so politically charged when it doesn't physically impact the average healthy person as people have stated.</p>

        <p>It should be opposite if you immediately assume we're all sick then you stay home and order door dash and whatever. I know I'm fucking healthy and do not need a mask so let me move around in the world freely. How arrogant to assume we should all stay home if we don't want to comply. This is the wrong think that's keeping us in this shithole. I'm tired of seeing people lose their jobs. I'm tired of seeing people commit suicide. I'm mentally drained from the fucking psychological warfare being waged on how we are pitted against each other and people have become vitriolic pieces of shit. I will never have faith in humanity again because I can now see how brainwashed and idiotic people are.</p>

<p>How does a mask not even a millimeter thick deter you physically from moving around if you don't have a health condition? The only thing stopping you would be mandates and laws by government local and federal from going to certain places without a mask.</p>

        <p>Well the problem here in the state of Victoria, Australia, is that the state law our state government is operating under is highly illegal... constitutionally illegal. So if you ever see an Australian telling people to go out and break the rules, it‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt legal or legitimate rules. Id be happy to explain if you‚Äôd like it explained further. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm sure other countries may be in the same boat. </p>
<p>On the misinformation topic, I have personally seen some posts with no evidence to back it up which I have commented in the past. </p>
<p>Also, how does someone determine what is and isn‚Äôt misinformation? Without personally proving myself the info posted anywhere, I can outright say nothing posted anywhere is true because I haven‚Äôt seen it myself so it could be false as far as I know. How would you define misinformation, how would you show its misinformation and could you give an example of something you‚Äôve seen here that you believe is misinformation? Cheers</p>

<p>I think personally it comes in when thousands or millions of pieces of data come to the same, or similar conclusions on a topic and is fact checked by others numerous times versus something with only a few hundred or thousands and is treated as fact or superior. Don't get me wrong, people can be incorrect and our understanding of things change. I feel it's more of a case by case basis and depends on the "weight" of the subject.</p>

        <p>Well unfortunately the argument that the majority is correct is one of the poorest principles to use. Think of the millions believing in god and angels despite no evidence, the millions that believed the earth was flat, the millions that believed the earth was the centre of the universe, the millions of nazis that believed they were doing the right thing etc. just because more people agree, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fact. There‚Äôs actually a rule of law which states that one should look to the quality and not the quantity. </p>
<p>So here in Australia, our constitution states that federal law overrides state law when it comes to inconsistencies. Victoria has a state law ‚ÄúThe Public Health and Well-being Act‚Äù that covers things like what we‚Äôre currently going through. There‚Äôs also a federal law called ‚ÄúThe Biosecurity Act‚Äù that covers the same thing. Now by federal law, you CANNOT give a health order on someone unless they‚Äôre confirmed to be sick, show physical symptoms and there is evidence that the person has been exposed to the virus. The state law pretty much let‚Äôs the state government do literally anything they want to literally anyone. So because the federal law overrides state law, not a single restriction imposed in the state of Victoria is lawful. So that‚Äôs why a lot of people are actively telling people to go about their day and live their lives because at the moment, there actually is no active lawful instrument that can impose any restrictions</p>

<p>Ohh that's interesting. Thanks for explaining to me!</p>
<p>&rt;Think of the millions believing in god and angels despite no evidence, the millions that believed the earth was flat, the millions that believed the earth was the centre of the universe, the millions of nazis that believed they were doing the right thing etc. just because more people agree, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fact</p>
<p>I see what you are trying to say, and that's why I said when backed up and checked under scrutiny and multiple scenarios coming to a similar conclusion. The scientific process is a process for a reason. Of course just because so many agree doesn't make it automatically fact. It's the collaboration and checking that statistically if 95% of the various arguements or studies has a similar outcome, then its logical to assume that it is more likely than not, factual.</p>

        <p>If you think looking carefully at data here, or a different approach to civil disobedience for this subject is somehow warranted you're missing the point. People should always disobey laws they believe are unjust, fight governments they believe are tyrannical, try and convince others we're going down the wrong path. Many will be wrong, and there are consequences to breaking the law, but if your judgement of the actions is based on your agreement, you clearly don't understand the need for such behavior.</p>

<p>I believe there should always be some healthy skepticism </p>
<p>&rt;MSM &amp; Government</p>
<p>So if I may ask, I see the term "mainstream" a lot. I know this means media and sites like CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC etc. But wouldn't FOX, OAN, Newsmax, NPR, AP also count as mainstream? I usually see MSM as a synonym for left wing media, but wouldn't some right wing media also fall into this category?</p>
<p>&rt;questions the narrative gets canceled</p>
<p>I believe there is a difference between questioning and compromising versus calling people sheep, devils, or just having a rant instead of a discussion, which I think everyone is guilty of at one point or another.</p>

        <p>I am a reasonable person.  But, as I started to lose my businesses ‚Äîpeople would tell me ‚Äúwhat? So you value money over lives?‚Äù
And when my kids would cry at their zoom classes‚Äîcan‚Äôt express any of that, or you ‚Äúthink teachers are only babysitters‚Äù. When your area suffers prolonged lockdowns, yet cases skyrocket, you hear ‚Äúwell, clearly people ignored every mandate! Lockdown harder!‚Äù

        <p>Absolutely FOX, OAN, NPR &amp; AP are mainstream media. Some MSM caters to democrat viewers and others to republican viewers. The latter tend to value freedom more than regulation (unless regulation is beneficial to their bank account). Either way these media outlets are so intertwined with large corporations and government that corruption and propaganda is inevitable. This is why you see journalists on both sides, like Matt Taibbi and Megan Kelly going out on their own producing their own content. And also why podcast like JRE are often the most popular - because deep down we know the MSM is lying to us on some level. Always follow the money, and be skeptical of everything you read/hear. Fear is a powerful tool in deception.</p>

<p>No one can claim to never be wrong, so you can't define what misinformation is in this context. Maybe in many years you can say that about Corona with some certainty, but certainly not now. </p>
<p>Dangers about vaccination, for example, are talked down by vaccine producers and politicians in order not to jeopardise their project. In my opinion, the dangers are small, but not being able to discuss them is completely unreasonable.</p>

<p>I'm no scientist, but I stated in a different comment about there being a difference between thousands if not millions of studies coming to one, if not various conclusions similar in scope, checked and revised, versus a few hundred or thousands that treat the opposite as false and their point as the truth. I dislike it when any issue or side does this and I do believe science is flexible. But where do you (general people you, not you personally) stop doubting and start listening (and vice versa)?</p>

        <p>Absolutely no one is saying these vaccines cause autism, but there is evidence of them causing severe allergic reactions, thrombocytopenia, and cold symptoms severe enough to hospitalize the eldery.</p>

        <p>&rt;...spreading misinformation about the virus and/or vaccines</p>
<p>I haven't really seen any discussion of the virus or vaccines, except to say that the potency of the virus has been overblown and vaccines are not really necessary for healthy people, both of which are completely uncontroversial comments.</p>

        <p>So I realize this post has gotten a bit out of hand at times and I asked around and got some advice that changed my view in this: for me to come in uninvited and basically start saying how I don't agree with you must be startling and unsettling. Also I realize now that "discussion" is more for people in this subreddit to talk about their issues and concerns, not an outsider like me to just come in and essentially start a debate. My questioning and topic would be more suited in a sub like "Askreddit", "change my view", or "political discussion". Moderatirs, if you want to delete this post, or I can remove it myself. I would be interested if anybody wanted to discuss some of this with me but I now realize that my placement and timing was poor, and I apologize.</p>

<p>To want to forbid others to speak and to believe that there is only one truth is no basis for discussion. Therefore, I agree with the comment of No-NPC-HERE.</p>

        <p>LOL no one here is started or unsettled sir. We also aren‚Äôt up for discussion where we have to be put on the spot to prove our POV or our beliefs and decisions. We do that all day, every day. Not here, young man!</p>
