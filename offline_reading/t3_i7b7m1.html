        <p>I’m glad someone is coming out and shedding light on this, but I’d love to amend the last paragraph so that instead of saying that they’re asking store employees to handle it when someone isn’t wearing a mask to “make policies so that those who are in this situation don’t have to wear a mask just to do their grocery shopping and go places”. I don’t want the people in the store enforcing this either to be quite frank, I want to be able to shop and live my life and get what I need without being thrown into constant panic attacks. Agree that the harassment from other customers needs to stop, but stores also need to step up and care for their customers with these issues instead of literally leaving them outside in the dust. </p>
<p>Again just my opinion but overall such a good thing to bring awareness to.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t want to tell a clerk why I’m not wearing a mask. What if I feel someone could take advantage of me sexually as a previous target?</p>
<p>“Exempt” should be enough for everyone. And you don’t have to have experienced rape to feel raped by wearing it. We all do.</p>

        <p>I just mean that it seems many stores won’t even accept exemptions at all. All the mandates includes exemptions, but stores aren’t required to honor that and many don’t. I’d never tell a clerk why I can’t wear one specifically, I shouldn’t have to say anything other than “medically exempt”. However even that doesn’t work anymore, I went shopping this weekend and I’d say about 90% of the stores I went into told me I couldn’t shop with no mask, regardless of the reason. It shouldn’t be like this. The stores should be following the mandates and allowing exemptions. And the whole “no exemptions whatsoever” thing like is happening on airlines now needs to stop. I’m still a human. I still need to get places, and I like some people are fine doing, I cannot sit at home twiddling my thumbs for months on end. I should not be stopped from doing what I need to do in life because I can’t cover my airways. And that goes for everyone.</p>
<p>I like the sentiment of the article but she insinuates that store owners should be handling the no mask thing themselves and be the ones asking you to leave, but I don’t think anybody should be forced to leave in this situation. The whole “stores can deny service even if you have a medical exemption” thing needs to end.</p>

        <p>If everyone revolts at the same time, they can't do shit about it. Labor Day was tossed around as a protest the tyrants day.</p>
