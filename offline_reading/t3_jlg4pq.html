    <strong>Does breathing fibers in, from masks, damage health?</strong>
    <p><p>So this is an article on fibers in general but I find it very enlightening as it gives clues what to expect from breathing through fabrics like masks (cloth or surgical)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/en/2018/03/how-damaging-is-breathing-in-microplastics/">https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/en/2018/03/how-damaging-is-breathing-in-microplastics/</a></p>
<p><em>The presence of microplastics in human lung tissue was already demonstrated in the 1990s by scientists investigating lung tissue of cancer patients, who expressed their concern that plastic fibers may contribute to the risk of lung cancer.</em></p>
<p><em>Research showed that plastic particles might persist in the lungs, especially in people with lung disease. When particles would remain in the lungs, they likely stay there for a long time because they are bio-persistent, which could cause inflammation. It also matters how long the fibers are because longer fibers appear to be more damaging.</em></p>
<p>Also if you need to see the presentation from Fransien van Dijk on effects of microfibers on lung development</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3JXJxyUD0w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3JXJxyUD0w</a></p>
<p>So certainly by breathing through masks will accumulate more of these particles in the lungs than normal breathing. At around 6:30 mins time it shows the demo of macrophages attacking the fiber particles as it was recorded during research. At 8:43mins you can see a graph of airway mini-lungs presence upon different types of fibers. With nylon fibers the percentage of airway mini-lungs drops to 30%.</p>
<p>What's very interesting though is the effect from these microplastics to the mini-lungs is similar to the effect reported by sars-cov-2 where mini-lungs are eliminated. My conclusion is breathing through a mask and also having a pathogen like sars-cov-2 present is a deadly combination. And breathing through a mask increases the concentration of fibers landed on the lungs compared to not wearing and it is damaging.</p></p>

        <p>No. There are absolutely no negative health effects associated with strapping a 7 month old piece of moist filth over your face and breathing through it all day, you sick and deranged grandma killer.  Now muzzle up.</p>

        <p>Honestly I don't think physical health drawbacks from masks are a hill worth dying on.  Even if they exist, there's bigger issues.  </p>
<p>Mental health issues and government overreach alone are big enough reason to fight mask mandates.</p>

        <p>Most masks are made of plastic fibres, basically flexible plastic, i'm a big advocate for real materials and fabrics, breathing in those fibres is not good for you, saw someone go into a coughing fit because of it.</p>
