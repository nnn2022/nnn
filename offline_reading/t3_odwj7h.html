    <strong>[SERIOUS] How likely is it that vaccinated people will become "zombies" ?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't mean to discredit the intelligence of the users here but I've been hearing a lot about the vaccines having the potential to cause prion and neurological diseases. Mad cow disease and Alzheimer's are common long term (2-3 years) side effects I keep hearing about. If you visit the r/covidvaccinated sub you'll see a few users mention memory problems and brain fog, and I've also heard a few people mention how friends and family members seem to have changes in personality after receiving the shots which are very early symptoms of the illnesses mentioned above.</p>
<p>A lot of people are talking  about the vaccinated developing some kind of neurological illness caused by the spike proteins in the shots being able to penetrate the blood brain barrier, do you see some kind of hybrid disorder resulting in "zombies" in the near future?</p></p>
