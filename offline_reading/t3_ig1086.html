        <p>&rt;mRNA vaccines represent a promising alternative to conventional vaccine  approaches because of their high potency, capacity for rapid development  and potential for low-cost manufacture and safe administration.  However, their application has until recently been restricted by the  instability and inefficient <em>in vivo</em> delivery of mRNA. <strong>Recent  technological advances have now largely overcome these issues, and  multiple mRNA vaccine platforms against infectious diseases and several  types of cancer have demonstrated encouraging results in both animal  models and humans</strong>. This Review provides a detailed overview of mRNA  vaccines and considers future directions and challenges in advancing  this promising vaccine platform to widespread therapeutic use.</p>

        <p>It's not my fear of being wrong; it's my frustration about how willfully ignorant some people are to the plethora of data we already have about RNA vaccines and how they work, and to how stubbornly they cling to their incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>Case in point - look at OP's case history. People with actual medical backgrounds have patiently explained to them repeatedly how they fundamentally don't understand how mRNA vaccines work, and yet still they bang on about the dangers of these vaccines, as if their ignorance somehow makes their opinion equally valid.</p>
<p>If you are genuinely interested in understanding the science behind these vaccines, then read these links instead of listening to OP prattle on about a topic which is so obviously beyond their capacity to understand:</p>

        <p>Do some basic research into how mRNA vaccines work and you'll understand why what you said doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>It has been proven that mRNA vaccines do not in any way alter or imbed themselves into our DNA. All they do is trick the body into generating an immune response and then then quickly deplete - so on what basis are you claiming that it will hang around in the body for up to 15 years? Do you have any factual basis for that claim?</p>

        <p>That's great. Then it should be a breeze to get people to adopt them in the mainstream in about 5-10 years when they are tried, tested and proven. Until then, they are an unproven, and potentially unsafe product</p>

        <p>COVID-19 vaccine development is hardly a typical case.</p>
<p>&rt; The process has been fast-tracked for COVID-19. The first human vaccine trials began in March, just two months after the virus and disease were identified. And <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-clinical-trials-1.5580436">different phases of human trials</a> are being run in an overlapping fashion instead of one at time — for example, Phase 2 might begin just a few weeks after the start of a six-month Phase 1 trial. </p>
<p>&rt; Still, officials, including the World Health Organization, have reassured the public that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1740310595817">no steps will be skipped</a>. That’s why Russia drew fierce criticism when it announced in mid-August that it was <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/russia-sputnik-vaccine-1.5681742">granting regulatory approval to a vaccine developed by Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology</a> after less than two months of human testing, with only two incomplete Phase 1 trials registered with the WHO.</p>

        <p>Just like the alarmists love to squawk about potential “long term effects of covid”, there is ZERO way to know about the long term safety of this vaccine. </p>

        <p>I don't see every sars-cov-2 vaccine there like this one:</p>
<p><a href="https://radvac.org/vaccine/">https://radvac.org/vaccine/</a></p>
<p>So the tracker is a big pharma exclusive list of vaccines I guess. As usual, secret serums and unknown substances. And a fake one too as most phases were skipped according to official sources.</p>

        <p>I think the theory behind the OP is this one here</p>

<p>Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE). So you are saying, that it cannot happen because somebody claims otherwise in another post here in reddit, right?</p>
<p>Because seriously, I don't see a way to verify anything. These mRNA drugs are not in the open market. So how can you possibly convince anyone to what they do or don't do? Unknown drugs, unknown  substances, unknown effects. </p>
<p>After listening drug advocates though, I doubt a vaccine can have an effect, because of the herd immunity claim. If they worked, nobody would ever talked about herd immunity. Works for the user and that's about it.</p>
