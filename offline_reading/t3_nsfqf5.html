    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 5/x: The "Epidemic situation of national concern" will be renewed for 3 more months. Meanwhile, the country has an incidence of under 30, a first state of under 10.</strong>
    <p><p>Backstory: In Germany it was not allowed to create laws/rules/measures like mask mandate (no matter if indoor or outdoor), social distancing, curfews, lockdowns and so on. Back then, Germany was a somewhat democratic country. Surely with some flaws, but you were relatively free to do what you want. Nobody can really deny that fact. But then the government created a monster, and reformed the "Infektionsschutzgesetz" (Infection Protection Act).</p>
<p>What exactly happened is that there was now an added passage called "Epidemische Lage von nationaler Tragweite" (Epidemic situation of national concern). While this Epidemic situation of national concern is "active", all power goes to the health minister. The health minister is by the way the de facto chef of the Robert-Koch-Institut, which you can compare to the CDC or NHS. Under this Epidemic situation of national concern is Health Minister can now do the following funny things:</p>
<p>Exit or contact restrictions in private as well as in public space,</p>
<p>Arrangement of a distance requirement in public space,</p>
<p>Obligation to wear a mouth and nose cover (mask requirement),</p>
<p>Prohibition or restriction of the operation of facilities that are attributable to cultural or leisure activities,</p>
<p>Prohibition or restriction of leisure, cultural and similar events,</p>
<p>Prohibition or restriction of sporting events,</p>
<p>Closure of communal facilities within the meaning of Section 33 or similar facilities as well as the issuing of conditions for the continuation of their operation,</p>
<p>Prohibition or restriction of accommodation offers,</p>
<p>Business or trade bans or closure of retail or wholesale trade or restrictions and requirements for businesses, trade, retail and wholesale,</p>
<p>Prohibition or issuing of conditions for holding events,</p>
<p>Prohibition as soon as this is absolutely necessary or imposing conditions for holding assemblies or religious gatherings,</p>
<p>Prohibition of alcohol distribution or consumption in certain public places or at certain times,</p>
<p>Prohibition or restriction of the operation of catering facilities,</p>
<p>Arranging the processing of the contact data of customers, guests or event participants in order to be able to track and interrupt possible chains of infection after an infection has occurred,</p>
<p>Travel restrictions.</p>
<p>Prohibition of gatherings or rallies within the meaning of Article 8 of the Basic Law and of religious or ideological gatherings,</p>
<p>Arranging an exit restriction, according to which leaving the private living area is only permitted at certain times or for certain purposes, and</p>
<p>Prohibition of entering or visiting facilities such as retirement or nursing homes, facilities for the disabled, maternity facilities or hospitals for close relatives of people treated, cared for or cared for there.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This Epidemic situation of national concern should have ended on 30.06.21 and will now be renewed until the 30.09.21. Meanwhile the incidence in Germany went down from 197,6 in December '20 to under 30 right now. At the moment we have constant downward trend of at least 25% per week. If this trend continues, we would be under an incidence of 10 at the end of this months. And still the Epidemic situation of national concern will be renewed.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists now start to claim that after the 30.09.21 everything will be back to "normal". They said the same thing after the Epidemic situation of national concern was renewed the last time. Just ask yourself: Will, at the beginning of fall/winter, this situation end? When viral infections rise again, like every year at the beginning of fall/winter?</p>

        <p>This seems to be going into a completely wrong direction. I’m sorry to say but Germans are so law abiding - no matter for what - it’s sickening. I’m here and see it live in action. Perfect shit storm.</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting these series. A friend of mine who is German and lives in Germany thinks that all these restrictions are temporary and "every thing will be back to normal in the fall". Do you think he's fooling himself?</p>
