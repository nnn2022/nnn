    <strong>Why were people so willing to change everything about their daily lives for covid but not other more dangerous issues that humanity generally faces?</strong>
    <p><p>Humanity faces threats like malaria and global climate change on a daily basis. Doctors and scientists have been screaming about these for a long time. Most people couldn't give a shit about the poluted environment they live in or the basic air quality on a given day. They cram themselves with shitty food and get no exercise. Doctors tell them about that every visit but they don't listen. So why was this different? Why did the world suddenly change its ways? Why do people now seem to "care about science" or other people's health status? They still don't give a shit about living in a clean space. Look at all the ppe they leave everywhere.</p></p>

        <p>Because wearing a mask is easy and makes them feel like they’re doing something “good/heroic”, only to then drop the mask somewhere and further contribute to the pollution issue.</p>
<p>I legit saw 3 disposable masks in front of the city hall earlier this month, all next to a trash can with a poster on it pointing out that not tossing out masks and gloves properly damages the environment.  It’s absolutely unreal.  And then found 6 more on the sidewalk (on one block) as I passed by the hospital.</p>

        <p>A serious answer, but just an opinion:</p>
<p>When it started we didn't know how bad it might be. And it's possible it was much worse in the early days, in Wuhan, because viruses normally become less and less lethal as they spread.  So right at the very beginning this virus at the very least <em>appeared</em> to be super deadly.  Strict measures were put in place, some which made sense, others that didn't.  It's hard for government to respond perfectly for something new like this; in this case it was mostly <em>far</em> from perfect.  Over time, and as new information came out, some of us were able to see that the drastic measures were 1) overreaching and 2) doing harm to other aspects of life.  But once panic has set in it can be very difficult to cope with coming out of it.  It was/is a trauma to lots of people, and for them it's not just something you can throw away like a piece of trash.  Also, governments and other entities are/were afraid of being wrong, and also held responsible if they happened to be negligent.</p>
<p>I'm not ignoring the other aspects of this; it was <strong>definitely</strong> used as a tool in America to cheat the election away from Trump.  The Left didn't see it at first though, so it wasn't planned by them, but once they <em>did</em> see it, well, they took the ball and ran with it.  That doesn't explain <em>every</em> Country's response, though one could make a similar case in many of them.</p>
<p>As for the general public buying into the fear....... well, that's not really something new.  It's probably more pronounced this time around than in the past, but I've seen it time and time again.  One <em>tiny</em> example I'll give here:  I live in Southern California; about 30 years ago there was a rash of 'freeway shootings' in which people fired their guns at other people, on the freeway.  It was <strong>big</strong> news at the time.  And people were afraid, of course.  But the likelihood of any <em>one</em> person being a victim of this was extraordinarily small.  Nonetheless, the media bombarded the masses with tales of "yet another freeway shooting victim".  Kind of like Covid; although the sheer numbers of people who have been affected by Covid are much higher, the percentage of people who have is quite small.  But after a while and as more and more numbers came out, people saw it for what it was, and now it is forgotten.  Covid is different because it's contagious, and a lot more people are affected, but the principles are similar I think.</p>
<p>And more recently, and since you brought it up, pretty much the same thing happened/is happening with "climate change".  It wasn't too long ago that a popular movie called it "global warming", but since that didn't happen an easier to 'defend' term was created i.e. 'climate change'.  For 4 billion years the climate on our planet has been in a constant state of change, only in the very last moment on a cosmic scale has it become an issue.  And even then it had to change its name because the models didn't work that that movie frightened people with, and even then only a tiny tiny moment before (again, on a cosmic scale) it was <em>global cooling</em> we were supposed to be worried about.  </p>
<p>Long post I know, but that's my take on it, in summary.</p>

        <p>&rt; global climate change  </p>
<p>They've been prophesying doom for decades. Not a SINGLE one of their prognostications came to pass. I'd really have thought that people would have gotten the memo by now.</p>
<p>I agree with you that there are more pressing matters for people to worry about: starvation and food insecurity, lack of access to clean water, homelessness, TB, malaria, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc. The difference is that the MSM has never waged a year-long globally-coordinated psyop on the world's population before.</p>

        <p>That is why I bought up climate change. The media loves talking about it. Many people are very worried about it. Then covid lockdowns hit and everyone is fine using plasticware for everything. Plastic to go containers and all the masks and gloves littering the streets are normal for those who would have raged against it pre covid.</p>

        <p>There is a God portion of people that working from home actually works for them.   They don't really care about going back to normal because they were never really part of "society" anyway.  You can see it all over reddit.  Being in lockdown and masks is actually preferable to them.. it's crazy but it's reality for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>Because billionaires told governments to order it. For everyone else- fear of penalty &amp; no choice. Sure, I'd love to disobey, go to a bar, play pool &amp; listen to a band. That's not an option because the almighty Governor has ordered all that banned. </p>
<p>Yeah, I could go to a store ragless, but an employee has to tell me to leave because 10 'Karens' are waiting to report any infraction &amp; the business WILL be fined.</p>

        <p>Laziness and greed basically, people need to realize how they would personally suffer from a problem, before actually trying to do anything about the problem. With covid, they're constantly afraid of getting sick themselves, as well as infecting others.</p>
<p>Climate, not so much because a different global average temperature doesn't matter. If the climate debate was more about trash on the ground, or massive amount of black smoke in the air. More people would definitely care.</p>
<p>In the end it's all fake tho, but yea, if you truly believe that you're gonna kill someone by not putting a mask on, you'd put that mask on "to save lives". If you truly believe that black smoke from the nearby coal plant, and trash on the ground, is gonna disappear, if you just pay your "climate tax". Then you'll pay your climate tax without bothering to think how that could possibly make a difference.</p>
