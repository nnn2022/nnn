    <strong>Resource for liberals/progressives/leftists about lockdowns, masks and 'protecting the vulnerable'</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a lifelong active leftist still fucking bewildered a year in by the lack of critical thinking applied by the people I thought had a similar political analysis to me, to the lockdowns/masks/mandatory vaccine discourse/etc. I have felt discomfort in even sharing my views with people around me because their worldview on this just labels me a "Trumper" or wacko. I know, I know - that says a lot about them - but some of these people I really love, and would like to continue sharing life with. SO, I made a RESOURCE - <a href="https://amomanom.medium.com/rethinking-covid-policies-and-risk-management-some-places-to-start-877233b355d3">https://amomanom.medium.com/rethinking-covid-policies-and-risk-management-some-places-to-start-877233b355d3</a> - that tries to speak to those people right where they're at.</p>
<p>I published it a couple days ago and it's gotten around 800 people checking it out so far and a number of people have messaged me saying it's been a really helpful tool in just sharing where they're at in a way that the people in their lives can't just immediately dismiss. So while it's already crossposted on r/LockdownSkepticism I'm sharing it here too in case it's helpful to anyone here.</p></p>
