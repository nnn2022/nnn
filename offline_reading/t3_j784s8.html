    <strong>Message to younger pedes: Do not go to college right now. Reevaluate your goals and take the uncertainty of the future into deep consideration.</strong>
    <p><p>I could make a book length rant about this but I'll try to keep it short. There is absolutely zero certainty of where we will be in 4 years. A stack of loans is the last thing you need right now. Especially with this ridiculous online bullshit. </p>
<p>Actually scratch that. The last thing you need right now is to be stuck at your parents house in the suburbs patiently waiting for the new normal to get interesting. </p>
<p>I somewhat recently graduated with a B.S. in Intl Business. The job market wasn't even that great before all this happened, now it's absolutely fucked. While jobs were plentiful, the pay wasn't. Where I live, Arbys has to beg people to work for them and offers 15 dollars an hour. Every job offer I received was 15-20 dollars an hour. </p>
<p>Now I'm on unemployment and have a stack of student loan debt that doesnt decrease after making payments every month. I don't have to be unemployed. I just prefer sitting home and avoiding the drones. </p>
<p>4 years from now is the most uncertain time in the history of the world. I think we all know deep down that this isn't ending without a fight. </p>
<p>DO NOT WASTE THESE 4 YEARS ON A USELESS PIECE OF PAPER. </p>
<p>The best advice I can give you right now is to learn a trade and get very good at it. Within the next year. Get a well paying job, stack your money, and buy a mediocre house in the middle of nowhere. Fuck a mortgage. Fuck student loans. The commutes for work will suck, but by 2030 I don't think that will matter anymore. </p>
<p>Saving and buying a mediocre house in the middle of nowhere with cash became my goal as soon as this bullshit started. I knew right away it was the march to tyranny. I feel like an idiot for the time I wasted. Don't end up like me. Don't be obsessed with the idea of a mansion and a Lambo. You will be ball and chained, forced to work every day for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>If I would have done what I am suggesting rather than going to college my future would be much more certain. I would be far more prepared for the looming SHTF. </p>
<p>It fucking sucks seeing you guys go through this. It sucks even worse because I know theres a couple like me that won't get brainwashed by the endless propaganda offered by colleges. Some of you guys are completely naive to the situation we are in. College should be the last thing on your mind honestly. It's not your fault, you're just trying to follow your dreams. </p>
<p>Unfortunetly now is the time to reevaluate your dreams. Or at the very least, put them on hold until the future is more certain. If that ever happens. </p>
<p>Good luck homies.</p></p>

        <p>Right now people are going into debt to watch classes on video from dorm room jails. I can’t imagine the insane world we have. </p>
<p>I worked 30 hours a week for 5.5 years to get my bachelors. I had one loan under $3000 that is long paid off. It was super hard to do and I complained a lot. However I’m not sure that was possible now for any college student - before covid.</p>

        <p>I'm in my 4th year of college, and I'm dropping out after this semester. I'm not willing to take on more loans to get a shitty education. I still want to finish (I'm getting a mechanical engineering degree, so it's actually worth it to go to college), but with everything online, I'm just not taking the BS anymore.</p>
