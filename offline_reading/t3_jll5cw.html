    <strong>A Reminder That Bravery Is Seldom Honored In Its Own Time</strong>
    <p><p>Don't forget that most of the people we celebrate now were not people who took the popular stance in their time, and were actually quite hated.  In fact the reason that people like Rosa Parks, Galileo, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Nelson Mandela, and Susan B. Anthony are so revered now is that they showed great bravery in fighting against the atrocities that were very much popular and accepted by the masses of those days.  And while we rightly remember their names in history, recognize that there were also many other brave people supporting them behind the scenes whose names we may never know, and without whom certain freedoms would never have been enjoyed.  And finally, please remember as well that they made their stances through peaceful means, often when it came at great cost to themselves.  We are not like the Doomers who wish death on those who disagree with them.</p>
<p>Just a reminder as you go about your day amongst the hysterical pro-Lockdown majority who care far more for their own perceived securities than they do for our freedoms.</p></p>
