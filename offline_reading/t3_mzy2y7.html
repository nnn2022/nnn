    <strong>The CDC has no right to comply people</strong>
    <p><p>This morning i saw the two fucktards  Rochelle Walensky and Fauci being broadcast on CNN ( to the surprise of no one) about how they think their being so merciful and are allowing people that got the vaccine can go outside without masks on. They had this fucking chart of where they thought where it was the most risk to not wearing a mask. Guys, i literally wanted to scream fuck you to the TV at the gym i was at i was so enraged, but i didnt wanna get eyeballs on me and get kicked out. Its annoying that there is some bullshit going around that the CDC thinks it has the power to govern over us when thats basically the complete reverse.  im not too upset tho,because despite what the Doomers think, not wearing a mask isnt illegal because what the CDC says in terms of our health isnt enforceable in terms of law.</p></p>

        <p>I thought this same thing yesterday. On SXM radio I heard some woke idiot doomer DJ say how the cruise lines were gonna have to set sail in the Fall now because the CDC told them they couldn’t in the Summer. I was like wtf? Seriously? The CDC doesn’t have that power. Either they’re seriously overstepping, the cruise line CEOs are just as idiotic as the average sheep, or this DJ is talking out of his ass. Could be all 3 in this clown world tho. Nevertheless it pissed me off that people think the CDC has lawful power.</p>

        <p>Lol. You sound like you have some anger issues. Also the CDC doesn’t make laws they inform the public, the health departments and lawmakers about the current Covid situation so they can make informed laws and mandates.</p>
<p>I think it would be beneficial for you to understand how governments work on a federal, state and local level. If you don’t you’re just gonna be angry about things that aren’t happening.</p>

        <p>Here is how governments work, they make up arbitrary rules as they go along, and if you have a problem with that they use the threat of violence to force you to comply.</p>

        <p>I know it’s hard but try to follow along. </p>
<p>The CDC falls under the US Health and Human Services department(HHS). So yeah the CDC wasn’t elected, but they were given their powers by HHS, which is run by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is appointed by the President of the United States(elected official) and confirmed by the US Senate (other elected officials). The elected officials are the ones who allow the CDC to have the power it has to inform Americans about the biological threats they face.</p>
<p>Does that make more sense? I hope you can try to make an effort to understand. It’s not that difficult.</p>

        <p>Of course they aren’t our rulers. But we do live in a society of laws and the people elected these people to do that job. Just because you don’t agree with their approach doesn’t mean they are your rulers but they are the lawmakers. If you disagree get  enough people who think like you and vote in someone else. But do try to get a grip man. You guys have such a persecution complex it’s just sad. Just wear a fucking mask when you have to go outside , avoid crowds and get vaccinated if you can and this shit can be over and the world can move on from this pandemic.</p>
<p>If that still not good enough for you. Move to a country that is more inline with your approach. It’s why so many people from other nations leave their countries of birth to come to the US and Canada.</p>

        <p>You poor thing, you actually fall for that bullshit.  There is no reason to be wearing a mask because the chance of getting sick from being outside is basically zero. Also, The problem is, they have no right to tell americans what they can and cant do as a whole. If someone wants to go to a concert or sporting event, its not on that person to wear a mask because other people are afraid to get sick from being in public. So UFC just had a massive event where the whole arena was fulled with people that werent wearing masks, so by your logic im gonna guess a good amount of those people are gonna die right? oh wait, no they wont LOL</p>
