    <strong>I joined medicine to make change and now I'm feeling defeated</strong>
    <p><p>I don't really have my full story anywhere so I thought I'd post it on here cause I never get to vent to people that are like me. </p>
<p>I became a nurse in 2019. A new graduate fresh out of school. I tutored other people in the lower years of my program. I always really enjoyed the science and inner workings of the human body. I received multiple scholarships in school that my clinical professors nominated me for, for my demeanor with my patients. Creating change in peoples life and speaking to them more, getting to know them has always been more important to me than just getting the tasks done and pushing meds. When I graduated I was super excited to start changing lives fully licensed on my own cause I never wanted to be the nurse a patient didn't look up to and one that doesnt inspire some hope in someone's life when everything is bad. I got hired at the hospital ive always wanted to work for, had a great orientation in a stepdown with a full hospital ran critical care class under my belt.</p>
<p>3 days off orientation... my unit became a covid icu. I had never taken care of an icu patient in my life and only had general practice unit experience under my belt and was still finding my bearings being on my own. This was the most terrifying and educational experience I've ever had. I really realized who I was during all this. I was taking care on patients on sometimes 7-8 drips, intubated and sedated and struggling to breath and nobody had a fucking clue what was going on. My first patient with covid as a new grad was a nurse from my hospital.... this was not an assignment you give to a new grad. This left me with so much anxiety fearing for my life that it could be me in that bed. I felt totally opposite than what I feel now and fell for all the propaganda due to what I've seen. The nurse ended up surviving after 4 weeks. We would code sometimes 8 people in a shift snd just start stacking up the bodies at the elevator (i work on a locked unit). After months of this went on, I started to really see what was going on. The ONLY people in my icu were people with comorbidites specifically that had something to do with inflammation. All the people that died were people that were intubated early. My whole family is in healthcare and we all started to research. I saw doctors online saying to treat it like high altitude sickness, intubate less, high flow oxygen early on, hyperbaric chambers, anything to not cause pressure trauma to the lungs from being invasive. Sadly.. as I watch these videos, and read these articles, these doctors were censored. One by one the posts and videos started to come down. My mindset began completely changing. I started to become angry with medicine. I realized what was going on. I knew they wanted this to go on much longer. People died for many more months. </p>
<p>Now mid summer my hospital is basically empty, nurses getting laid off cause there's no patients for the staff to take care of. This went on forever while the whole time the media said we were still packed to the brim with covid. This caused our typical patients to come in even less, and when they did, they were severely ill with a poor prognosis cause they weren't able to afford their meds going jobless or get any surgeries due to the restrictions covid imposed. They waited till the very last minute to come in thinking they may get covid at the hospital. This made me severely angry and since then my world has been completely flipped upside down. My unit went back to normal, we got our normal patients back but then it started again in November. I watched a video by geert Vanden bosche explaining how the mass vaccination of people will cause a plateau and then we will see a steep increase in cases from the vaccine not protecting adequately against covid and contributing towards the formation of variants... he was right here we are.</p>
<p>I feel trapped in this profession. Hospital is full of covid again, plenty of the people which are vaccinated. Most of the people I talk to other than my few go tos are brainwashed. Im sick of wearing a fucking face diaper and having people with no education or experience with the patient population telling me they have any fucking idea how this disease works when they can't even comprehend how vitamin d works. Also how does anybody thats vaccinated or anybody that stays home get effected by anyone else's choices? It makes 0 sense. Im at my wits end. I feel my schooling was useless, I feel defeated at my job, the public has actively seeked out credible professionals and attempted to make them less credible. I feel like im living in a movie. What the fuck is going on? </p>
<p>This is not why I joined medicine.</p>
<p>I really have found that my values and morals and me being honest with my patients about what im seeing rather than pushing an agenda is more important to me. Patient Welfare is more important to me than my job or the amount of money I help my hospital generate. I did this to help people and just be human. I dont care about the money or how good of a person the title nurse makes me look. I'll sacrifice my whole reputation to change the way the system works. I just feel as though I can't make this change.</p>
<p>Can anybody at all relate?</p></p>

        <p>I left nursing in 2019 and went into a totally different field. Take it from a (former) young maverick nurse, you need to absolutely CYA if you are going to be telling patients things that contradict the narrative. CYA is always rule 1 in nursing and especially now. Management will throw you to the wolves if you become inconvenient and it doesn't matter how much you think they like you. Healthcare is a dog eat dog world and you are a puppy, be careful.</p>

        <p>I get what youre saying. How do we ever change how the system works and put the people that need the care most first though if we all just quit?? Someone has to be able to change something.</p>

        <p>Good on you for fighting the system, I left because I wanted to be happy and was disgusted with how healthcare is inherently designed to treat people like human cattle, be it a for profit private insurer or a publicly funded program, both types of payment resulted in the same abuse of the patient. I couldn't bring myself to be a part of that any longer.</p>

        <p>I'm so confused right now cause this is not what my experience in university was like. Part of your comment makes me happy and part upset. I would love to do something different thinking ill be happy and fulfilled, but part of me thinks I won't be, knowing I could have actually helped people and I gave up on them. I work my ass off for my patients and I dont know if I'll be quite as good at anything else.</p>
<p>The person that precepted me on my unit is studying to become a nurse practitioner and is completely supportive of the way I feel about everything as he wants to create change too, but he doesn't have an answer for me.</p>

        <p>Well of course your experience in university was not like that, neither was mine. Now I spent my short career working in rural nursing homes in Wisconsin, so your work experience is going to be much different and perhaps the overall culture of the profession is different in your area and field. All I can do is speak for what I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>It is hard to feel like you walked away from a higher calling, I coped by convincing myself that the whole higher calling thing is just a marketing technique. I saw tons of guilt tripping used to convince nurses and aides to work while sick, postpone vacations, come back from medical or maternity leave, etc. A lot of that was subtle too, you would hear employees say it themselves, "Oh I couldn't leave this job because I care for my patients", stuff like that. Of course that benefited the employers more than anyone else. </p>
<p>It was like watching Stockholm syndrome in real time to see unhappy people stay in unhappy situations because of a hero complex that gets ingrained in them from day one of their schooling. I told myself I only needed to be my own hero because nobody else was going to do it for me.</p>

        <p>It was never school that made me feel like a hero. I actually rarely feel like a hero at all. Im fortunate to have a good paying job, although it sucks, and have a family that backs me and supports me no matter how I feel. Im very lucky.</p>
<p>I think the real heros are the people with medical conditions other than covid, people that lost their jobs that have families and people that have nowhere to go that are somehow making things work. These people truly astound me cause I couldn't do what they do. Self proclaimed healthcare heros actually piss me off. We arent heros. We are people helping people. Everyone should help one another. Its the right thing to do. </p>
<p>I dont exactly feel I can't leave I just dont know what else I'd do that I'd be good at and I never wanted to be defeated when I do well in it.</p>

        <p>I used to think I could never do anything else either, but I was wrong about that. What I do now pays almost as well and is way easier and less stressful. My wife is a nurse and she comes home way more stressed out than I do. </p>
<p>I never viewed quitting nursing as being a defeat, like the system broke me. The system did break me at one point, but I climbed back up and returned to full power, and only at that point did I leave, like an aging athlete who came back from an injury, had a great season, and then retired while still having a lot left in the tank. </p>
<p>In the end it is just a job, no matter how much they try to sell you on the idea that you're part of some special profession. The main point of working is to make money and not go home every day hating life, whatever job helps you do that best is where you belong.</p>

        <p>My best friend works as a dispatcher for a trucking company, a decent sized one that is a subsidiary of a large nationwide trucking and logistics corporation. He told me about what his job was like and that his company was hiring. I applied for a night dispatch position and I've been there for two years. It is a job that didn't have any schooling requirements, although my background as a nurse actually has transferable skills like telecommunications, written communication, and customer service. I've been doing that for two years now and I'm much happier than I was before. 12 hours, sit down job, no getting called in, no forced overtime, no taking work BS home with you. I wouldn't call it mindless work but for me it is like doing grade 9 homework compared to how difficult nursing was.</p>

        <p>Do what is right. Hydroxychloroquine, Vitamin D and Ivermectin are great medicine for covid. Follow the Hippocratic Oath, even if it means to get fired and change your job.

        <p>Thanks for sharing your story. I can relate although I am not in medicine, but rather in education. I also feel defeated. I earned a PhD in science because I was passionate about learning the truth and sharing the truth. A career in academia was appealing to me because of the freedom of thought I envisioned I would have. I am currently in my first year as an assistant professor and I feel restricted, trapped, silenced, and sometimes afraid. Feels as if fellow faculty, administrators, and students are like predators seeking someone to cancel. If you dare to disagree with the mainstream, you immediately get shunned. They begin treating you like a lesser human being; as if you're a child and need to be educated to become worthy of this noble professor position. </p>
<p>Where is all of this pressure coming from? Why are people so afraid of ideas that they need to cancel any source of ideas that is contrary to the mainstream? Who decides on what the mainstream is? Why do people so vehemently defend the mainstream ideology when there are countless examples of lies and hypocrisy in the mainstream?</p>

        <p>These are very very good questions and im glad that someone somewhat relates to what im experiencing. Whatever happened to the people who critically think thay everyone thought was awesome? Now its like if you dont dumb yourself down and force yourself to not question things, they will come for you. </p>
<p>I was always told by my professors that I should keep asking questions and was removed from a class In first year for asking questions beyond the scope of a first year student cause they were taking away from the class and becoming a distraction. I switched classes at this point. Every other professor has always said I should keep being curious and challenging things I dont see fit. Now when I try im met with resistance. Hard for me to grasp.</p>

        <p>Right!!! I was also encouraged to pursue my curiosity when I was a student. Now just feels like everyone wants to tell everyone what to do, rather than encourage them to find out for themselves.</p>

        <p>Yes, that's a very good point. A lot of us (especially young people) have no hope in our financial well-being in the future, so it makes sense that many people with low paying jobs are angry. Just wish that anger was directed at whatever is causing our collective misery rather than at each other.</p>

        <p>Hey there I'm a nurse as well too. Unfortunately these hospitals don't give a rats ass about nurses and it saddens me to see how they threw you into the lion's den as a new grad taking care of patients not within your scope. </p>
<p>When this whole Covid started last year March I worked in Observation which is considered outpatient and the number of patients being admitted to my old floor decreased rapidly so they would throw people on my floor into the ER department to work which in my opinion is a completely different animal from what we were used to. Fortunately I was changing departments to work in medical-surgical system float and for my last few shifts I called off because I ain't throwing my license away for working in a higher acuity specialty.</p>
<p>It saddened me seeing patients who were so scared of Covid stayed home rather than seeking immediate medical attention. </p>
<p>The census was hella low from March to July I found myself being cancelled a lot from my job and I was barely getting any hours. I was under a lot of anxiety and damn near had a panic attack.</p>
<p>But I understand and sympathize with you. It boggles my mind that people think slapping on any type of mask is going to protect them from Covid or that social distancing is going to stop the spread. I shake my head when I see fellow nurses regurgitate this bullshit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately nursing is not the benevolent job that your professors made it out to be this career sucks ass and will suck the soul out of you. I've been in this career for 8 years and the only reason why I continue is because it pays well considering I only work 3 days a week and because I have a mortgage but I only plan of sticking in this field until my late 30s and possibly consider working as an accountant or real estate. You'll come across shitty ass nurses, nursing assistants and doctors who give no fucks and it disturbs me working with such individuals. My only suggestion is find another specialty in nursing consider home care or working for insurance.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your insight as someone with experience and I definitely feel for you having no hours during that time period as I saw it happen to many around me. I didnt realize it sucked this much till I actually got here, but it has its good days and I feel extremely good leaving a shift and looking back and going "I just did all that". I never thought I'd be able to do what im doing and im proud of myself for that. I've met tons of the shitty ones, this is why I stick around cause like we can't just leave those who need us with the shitty miserable people 😂 also have no clue what else id do i didnt have a back up plan. I did everything within my power to get to this point so it would suck to throw it all away.</p>

        <p>I had over 100+ hours of PTO so that's what saved me from really going under since I seldomly called off work.</p>
<p>The first 6 months of nursing is like the honeymoon phase that you are in love with the career but between the 6 months to 2 years of nursing is when you get to see things for how they really are and that's when the burnout begins. This is the time when many new nurses question themselves and outright quit because they see how nursing isn't what it's made it out to be. Having to deal with management always throwing you under the bus and the politics on the floor can drive anyone into madness, it did that to me and I ended up leaving my floor.</p>
<p>We need more nurses like yourself who advocate for patients and really take pride in giving good care. I'm tired of working with lazy ass nurses/nursing assistants who don't wanna do the bare minimum for their patients and during Covid it seems like people got even more lazier. They don't even want to wash patients or repositioned them and then they wonder why these patients got bedsores. Or working with doctors who know that the patient is in pain and refuse to order them appropriate medications.</p>
<p>Consider maybe changing into a different specialty might help. I got real burnt out with working on obs and went into the float pool and I like it since I go to different floors and hospitals and don't have to deal with as much BS and politics.</p>

        <p>Just curious, do you think ventilators were actually harming patients during the early days of COVID? Some part of me just can’t seem to shake off that feeling some of my family friends were killed by ventilators. I know it sounds absurd but just wanted to know ur opinion.</p>

        <p>Yes unfortunately. We learn in school that ventilators are obviously a positive intervention, but they arent fool proof and have down sides. </p>
<p>You have whats called PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure). This setting keeps air pushed into the lungs even when you fully exhale to keep the small sacs where gas exchange occurs called the alveoli from collapsing and not being able to reexpand especially in the bases of the lungs (called atelectasis). </p>
<p>Positive end expiratory pressure support helps patients more adequately ventilate, but in excess can cause barotrauma (pressure damage to the tissue) to these very fragile airways. You can imagine the potential a vent has to cause damage on already scarred lungs from corona, but some times this is the only other option to keep a patient alive.</p>
<p>This intervention was being done way too early in the start of this pandemic and when other treatments were initiated first, icu mortality decreased.</p>

        <p>I work in healthcare as well (non-clinical) - every morning I wake up wishing it was fall of 2019 again. From another post I made a little while back:</p>
<p>&rt; I wanted to go into healthcare because it was the most neutral field I could think of. I didn't want to end up working for a company that churns out overpriced trash. But over this last year, I've wanted to quit every day. Despite the legitimate treatments being performed, I find no comfort in knowing that I contribute the slightest bit to propping up this hellscape.</p>

        <p>My heart goes out to you OP. I ran into a similar disillusionment in my first profession and, through a lot of soul-searching, had to change to a different career. I sacrificed a lot to do so but I have never once, not for one second, <em>ever</em> been sorry. In my current career I am able to meet the same goals I was trying to meet in the old one, only far more effectively! I hated the feeling of "throwing away" everything I had done to get to the point where I re-evaluated.  Funny enough it was not thrown away, and I've been able to use the knowledge from my first career both in my second one and in lots of other ways in life to help others. </p>
<p>The thing I had to do was get truly honest with myself. My goals were very similar to yours. You said: "my goal has always been to help people and invoke change in the world. I wanna leave a positive mark when I go." </p>
<p>After I got into the first career, I discovered there was such a mountain of stupidity in the way of me actually being able to help anybody, that 95% of my energy was spent getting the stupidity out of the way, and 5% of my energy was left for actually helping people. I didn't want to believe this about my oh-so-noble profession. But the evidence was all around me.  It was making me miserable. On top of that, I did not have a single happy colleague. </p>
<p>I found this unsustainable, so I looked for a career where the price to my mental health would be lower and my ability to meet my basic goals would be higher. Like I said, it was wrenching, I had to disappoint some people, had to start over in a different field, had to invest more in education and training, had to take several jobs to pay for the transition; and since the change I've made less money than I would have in the other line of work.</p>
<p>You know what though? It was all worth it! I meet my goals on a regular basis. I finish work with a feeling of contentment and happiness, more often than not. I feel like the stupidities I have to get through in order to help people are orders of magnitude smaller, and the successes I have at assisting a positive change in people's lives are orders of magnitude larger. And the people I initially "disappointed" with my change have all come to see how much happier I am, and now all agree that the change was the right decision. Ultimately their approval, while it means something, doesn't mean as much as my own sure knowledge that it was the right decision for me and that I am much happier having made the change.</p>
<p>I don't regret trying the first career. It's something I had always wanted to do and would have spent a lifetime regretting if I hadn't tried. Now I look back at it, proud of myself for trying, and proud of myself for the honesty that it was never going to be what I wanted it to be.</p>
<p>I know a change can feel overwhelming and scary, and truthfully parts of the shift to another job or another profession will suck. But it sounds to me like you are a good soul who will be able to help people far more effectively in a different structure than the one you're in.  </p>
<p>It's your one and only life so far as we know. I hope you are able to find a more positive environment in which to manifest your gifts.</p>

        <p>Nurse here. Went on FMLA in fall when daughter had concussion (hospitalized 3 days) and my hospital (been there 10 years) completely dismissed her symptoms.  In the same time my neighbor had a cardiac event and my hospital diverted him.... which could have seriously cost his life.  I was so angry at the failures I had to leave for my mental health (and daughter for a few weeks).</p>
<p>I came to nursing as second career and had idolized view as well.  Over the years I have adapted to the ever growing shitpile I’m burdened with that do nothing for the patients.  I had a meltdown early in nursing school (crying over how sad nursing home was) and my professor said it is sad—but you can make a difference. When everything is stacked against you, you can do better.  Framed that way I have always found a way to avoid the burnout.  It wasn’t all the fffffff covid crazy, it was how I interacted with the system that just broke my spirit.</p>
<p>I have been working contract work for the health department which brought me back to what I love about nursing.  I’d love to do public health (not the policy dictators) but the hard work of harm reduction/health education.  Unfortunately it’s just a gig I likely can’t transition without more Ed (that’s a nope).  Continue to grow your skills and learn and look for opportunities to network for a different setting.  </p>
<p>I wish I had something more encouraging, but it wouldn’t be genuine.</p>

        <p>Cause believe it or not the poorest patients i take care of in the US still get better care than the average Canadian. Both systems are flawed, but Canada is worse in terms of actual quality of care.</p>

        <p>I kinda fucked up a relationship with a long friend of mine. His wife was in a similiar position than you, just finished college, one month into working at a hospital before Covid came. She was completely in fear of what was to come. Even the notion of me not believing the hype got hysteric responses.</p>
<p>Didnt realise how much of an effect the news about an upcoming pandemic has on the minds of those who are directly confronted by it. Its probably similiar to an emergency doctor when he is called to massive car crash involving dozens of people, just that you dont arrive at the spot in 20 mins and be done 20 hours later, but are constantly in that state of mind.</p>
<p>Unforutanetly unlike you, she never came around.</p>

        <p>I really suggest you read "undercover epicenter nurse". She says exactly the kind of thing you are describing. In fact I questioned that you might be HER. LOL</p>

        <p>Psychiatrist here; this is an 11/10 post, no hyperbole.</p>
<p>You're so spot on it made my morning; you are a lucid professional that prioritizes highlighting corruption that human consciousness all too fondly caters to.</p>
<p>&rt;Im sick of wearing a fucking face diaper and having people with no education or experience with the patient population telling me they have any fucking idea how this disease works when they can't even comprehend how vitamin d works</p>
<p>This right here. I'm also a certified personal trainer and nutritionist. You can imagine how thrilled I was to hear people that don't know their own BMI, can't see their feet, or breathe without a c-pap machine tell me I'm selfish for not getting a chemical cocktail they also don't understand, lol.</p>
<p>Daily exercise, fresh air, sunshine, positive thinking and journaling coupled with high vitamin C and D intake and you are nearly untouchable form all of this bullshit. That's why propaganda is required to convince the group of people that already foolishly jump to vaccinate that they made the right decision. </p>
<p>Those made that behavioral choice because they operate via unconscious insecurity. Seeing others question what for them is obvious means they could be wrong and we can't have that, this group is way, way too undeservedly proud of their own insulated knowledge to admit being wrong! That's for people that don't trust science!</p>
<p>Keep going. PM if needed. We need to stick together.</p>

        <p>As a fellow nurse I hear you. I trained in RSA. I was disappointed  in the system from the get go and worked in health promotion. After coming to Canada I tried a year of hospital work and left. I started working  in health promotion again and actually making  a difference in people's  lives. You could go into private practice and help promote  health.</p>

        <p>You should strike.</p>
<p>You should feel horrible about what your industry became. It's literally the cause of the hypochondria fascism we see around the globe.</p>
<p>We expect this from Politicians and Reporters... but they wouldn't be able to do this shit to us if it wasn't for the "Do No Harm" healthcare profession.</p>
<p>I'm old enough to remember Nurses used to strike for a 5% pay raise... The fact that no one has gone on strike over covid should tell you a lot.</p>
