    <strong>No, we don't have to define our terms</strong>
    <p><p>Everyone understands the common-usage of words. There's no reason to define terms. The left insists on playing this stupid game because their ideas can't stand-up to scrutiny. So in order to compensate they redefine words and attempt to make language incredibly abstract and malleable so you can never pin them down on anything ever. You can never specify anything enough with these people. They will pretend to be confused by what you say so they can weasel their way out of anything. They'll also play equivocation. Don't fall for it.</p></p>

        <p>I think the Left and the Right are starting to realize we have more common ground than we thought.  The shitshow since the "election" and the COVID-justified fleecing of Americans have certainly taught me that the Democrats and Republicans are the same.  Blue shit or Red shit, it still tastes like shit.  They are all swamp.  It's now the people against the government.</p>

        <p>I would love to agree with you but the social policies of the progressive left are my biggest problem and are in my opinion a huge driving factor of the pro lockdoqn mentality. </p>
<p>It is hard to find common ground when you fundamentally disagree with someone's world view. I wish I could but things like gender fluidity, welfare programs, federal minimum wage, zero border security, abortion time lines, equality of outcomes,  etc.. just dont work for me.</p>

        <p>Idk, in the UK everyone seems as bad as each other. Tories have already made a mess of this, Labour want stricter lockdowns and the SNP just keep trying to be stricter than England to one-up them, even to the point where they're advocating for zero covid.

        <p>'None of the above'. It's what I vote, at least. The Labour party having been infiltrated and destroyed doesn't mean that what it once was doesn't still exist in terms of ideology and support, though: which matters when it comes to potential alternatives.</p>

        <p>I don't pretend they are friends, i just forget about them completely because this pandemic has shown what they really are.</p>
<p>Just like the way I see people now will probably never change because what has happened this last year is so bad that there is no way to justify this level of rubbish. </p>
<p>What I am trying to say is that calling people libtards for being leftists or nazis for not being it is totally childish and irrelevant if you take in count we are all fucked either way, this goes beyond parties and I think we should focus on what is important, which is the lack of freedom and rights we are going through and the rules these fuckers are imposing on us (left and right wing) and find a way to solve the problem instead of calling people names.</p>
<p>Same with discriminating other people for whatever other reason. Gay, trans, black, white, American, whatever other tag. How is this relevant when we're all fucked?</p>
