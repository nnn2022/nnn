    <strong>It's like a bunch of woke sleeper cells were activated in the spring of last year...</strong>
    <p><p>The combination of COVID and the incident where the criminal-who-pointed-a-gun-at-a-pregnant-woman's-stomach died while resisting arrest seems to have activated a bunch of "woke sleeper cells."</p>
<p>So many people who were normal a year ago turned into complete raging lunatics in the spring of 2020. What happened? Does anyone understand the psychology of these woke sleeper cells? I understand the people who were always woke, they're just miserable losers who want everyone else to be miserable with them and they also have easy lives so they want to create conflict to create meaning.</p>
<p>But what about the normal people who seemed to have entered a state of mass psychosis in spring of 2020? I can't understand them.</p></p>
