    <strong>Leprosy: the government’s history of forced quarantine</strong>
    <p><p>It took a very long time for them to figure out that some people can’t get Leprosy. They would cart people who had it off to a place in Hawaii called Molokai and leave them there to die because they were worried about others being affected. They were hunted down and killed if they were thought to have it and refused to go or tried to hide. They would even be killed if a neighbor said they have it and they refused to turn themselves in for “testing” which was often just a doctor looking at something as benign as eczema, calling it leprosy, and sentencing them to go to Molokai. This started in 1866. Over 8000 people lived/died there and the conditions (especially at first) were absolutely barbaric. They were promised treatment and dropped off left to starve on inhumane rations and die, but eventually created a functional town for themselves. The government allotted them some more supplies once they realized letters were getting out that spoke of the conditions, but a lot of people died out there before that. There are STILL people living there who were sent there (6 as of 2015). They were allowed to leave as of 1969, but it’s all they knew so they stayed. </p>
<p>That’s right, we had a colony of people not allowed to leave a rugged, isolated edge of a Hawaiian island until 1969 even though their disease was curable with antibiotics. 
If you want to read more about that here is one article https://www.history.com/news/leprosy-colonies-us-quarantine</p>
<p>To study the disease they took otherwise healthy criminals and tried to infect them, but for some it didn’t work no matter how hard they tried. They later learned that it was because 95% of people exposed to Leprosy (now called Hansen’s Disease) don’t develop symptoms because their immune system fights it off. The susceptibility toward catching the disease seems to run in families.</p>
<p>So to recap, all of these people were tortured, sent to an inhumane long term quarantine “colony” for a disease that often wasn’t fatal and that people could live with for many years. 95% of people NEVER develop symptoms when directly exposed even over time. The people don’t think our government would do us wrong, separate families, and and murder us if we don’t comply can’t even go as far back in history as 1969. 52 years ago. If you’re interested in a longer book about this subject there is one called The Colony: The Harrowing True Story Of The Exiles Of Molokai. My parents were in their teens and this place still had people quarantined for an easily cured bacterial infection. </p>
<p>As a side note, if you’re homeschooling your kids this is a good history lesson about not only how understanding of diseases develops over time, but that fear and assumptions can lead to whole groups of people being needlessly cut off from society and vilified.</p></p>

        <p>This is true. I lived in Hawaii for many many years. The way the government treated the native Hawaiians was horrible.</p>

        <p>Historically, they’ve been treated terribly. They started rounding them up well before Hawaii was a state. The US continued keeping people at Molokai for 10 years after Hawaii was a state. Wealthy white people could afford to buy their way out of that one way ticket for the most part, but a few ended up out there. It was mostly natives though. It now looks like they’re somewhat more predisposed to susceptibility and for that reason after they were exposed by travelers/tradespeople it moved through their population in a way that made it seem more contagious. I wouldn’t be surprised if several years down the line we find out somethings similar about this virus. Or if they already know some thing and just aren’t telling us</p>

        <p>No problem. I hope a lot of people see it because it’s such a recent example of the lengths they’ll go to to enforce quarantines. People even met each other, married, and had children on Molokai. Those children were taken from the parents at birth and many are still alive today never having met their birth parents.</p>
