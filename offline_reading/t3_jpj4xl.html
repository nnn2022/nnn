    <strong>It was never about the virus, so what is the real cause for all of this?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I can’t help but keep wondering and asking myself many questions. First of all- I do like conspiracy theories but I treat it more like a leisure/ “what if...” sort of game and there are only few socially not acceptable nor confirmed theories I’d agree and treat as a “real” truth. </p>
<p>Given that, I have a quite open mind but I still try to question everything- either it comes from mass media or some alternative random conspiracy channel. </p>
<p>One thing I’m pretty sure about  though; current situation with this virus and all is so extremely bizarre, so uniquely orchestrated and it just does not make any sense. </p>
<p>It never did make sense to me. I have a lot of history knowledge and I’m deeply interested in politics. Even in March it was hard for me to treat governments speeches as the only truth. It was pretty logical for me- the world is ruled by money, government have never ever cared about weak and vulnerable individuals. It absolutely had no sense to have them shut the economy for the sake of protecting older and vulnerable people. They like money too much. Most of them are the same people who were making decisions on managing and financing wars in the Middle East. They do have a lot of blood on their hands and I will never buy they care about some old people. </p>
<p>So why? Why there was not only one lockdown but now we have another and most likely there will be a third one too? Tuberculosis kills 1.5 M people a year, is infectious and has been called a pandemic by WHO yet we never got even close to whatever is going now. Guess the word “pandemic” is only literal when it comes to some first world countries but it’s absolutely irrelevant when it affects Africa eh? Moreover there is a vaccine for TB, we have money to freeze our world economies but we never had money to help poorer countries to fight a disease causing a different sort of pandemic?</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m giving a benefit of doubt anyone passing by my post is on the same side and has never considered this virus a real threat. I saw here some lost people trying to argue with that, this is not a thread touching on that subject. 
It’s been proved multiple times coronavirus is not a threat to our society and is extremely far from media’s portrayal. </p>
<p>I just wanna hear your ideas why possibly this is happening. Control? But why do they need more control? Money is a control anyway so what can they get from putting all humanity into some Orwell dystopia? Is the virus man-made? If so, what for? </p>
<p>It just looks like the goal was to ruing economy. This is the only answer that comes to my mind- like a purposely man-made reset on economy without having people realising it since most of them direct their focus on a different issue. But then I still can’t think of a reason why they would want to destroy it. Except for a scenario where we are entering a world where economy is irrelevant. Worlds like that are usually worlds caught up in big wars. </p>
<p>Thoughts? </p>
<p>Tl;dr just a meaningless post doing some brainstorm on potential concepts answering the real reason for everything what is happening now.</p></p>

        <p>It's a destabilization operation, being engineered in collaboration with global intelligence agencies, banking institutions and world political leaders. The "security measures" make no sense if you look at them strictly from a point of "preventing viral transmission" but when you study the rise of totalitarian regimes, the psychological conditioning that compels people to comply with these regulations is strikingly familiar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a mass social engineering event in order to dehumanize and isolate us from organizing with our community, to destabilize our economy so that we're desperate, fearful and reliant on lower-wage employment or government assistance and to destroy the education of our children so they will be less equipped to achieve upward mobility and also lack the fundamental cognitive abilities to question authority, not to mention stunting their cognitive development by stripping them of non-verbal human expression, thereby encouraging social development that skews toward symptoms found on the autism spectrum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're all watching the moment that a global totalitarian force is attempting to take control, disguised as individual nations reacting to a perceived "threat." We're watching it happen before our eyes and nobody wants to believe it because it's just a "conspiracy theory"...just like every other time in history.</p>

        <p>It's not a merely a conspiracy theory to everyone, it just looks that way because you're on Reddit. Reddit is  one of the media channels controlled by the elites.</p>
<p>If I were a propagandist trying to demoralize this community, I would constantly equate the manufactured consensus encountered on this platform with actual public opinion.</p>

        <p>I would like to believe that and you're correct, there are some who see the underlying dangers but we're a major minority. Most people just kind of tune out/lose interest when you start referencing historical context. They can't make the connection because it's too abstract. They believe that Germans and Russians woke up one day, ruled by tyrants. They've never considered or conceived of the idea of mass coercion, mass <em>hypnosis</em>. They glaze over and just refuse to process the possibility that something like that would or could ever happen within their lifetime. It's a defense mechanism. They can't cope with the idea of being lied to on such a deep and nefarious level.</p>

        <p>Maybe not insignificant but won't be enough to turn back the gears of the machine that's driving this. The momentum is too great. Any attempt to rise up at this point will play into the hands of authoritarian leaders who have their fingers on the button, ready to launch martial law and further empower the police state. I'm hopeful that we can find ways to turn the tides but I believe that a great many people genuinely accept and desire this new slavery.</p>

        <p>I mean I was being sarcastic and just joking saying Covid is for Democrats. But you make a good point about not fucking with the clowns and steering away from the circus. As far as this election These people are relishing in the victory this time becaose they got big mad orange bad man out (maybe). But next who knows who wins but slowly but surely all the sudden these people will also be getting sensored, have their rights slowly diminished, and their money taken away. And they think these govt dickweeds know them personally and will care since these people support the govt. but the govt won’t care about them all they’ll know is “this person has spoken out against the establishment” and then they will not be cordial with them. There are no parties in this system we’re heading for, there is only them and that’s it. Crazy times for sure</p>

        <p>Facts. This ain't over til the electoral ballots are cast in December and it's confirmed. Everyone wants to count their chickens when they think "their team" won. They don't realize they might be setting themselves up to be very confused and angry. Unfortunately, I believe that might be the whole point.</p>

        <p>Yes it sure is the whole point that’s why the media has been so quick to call everything for Biden, in case anything g gets reversed they can say trump “stole” the election. I live in Chicago and I know for a fact the riots will be worse than the BLM riots if that happens</p>

        <p>Whether or not those protests amount to anything depends on this: are those masses of people committing to a rejection of the new system, or are they just making a bunch of noise? If they say, "I don't like that!" but otherwise continue on exactly as they were before, then nothing will get better, because they were already on the path to hell before--only now, they've started to feel the heat. They've been preparing us for this for a long time.</p>
<p>But if those people reject the globalist paradigm <em>and live out that rejection</em>, just watch happens. The enemy's plans count on us being apathetic, coddled, and fearful. So the battle begins on the inside. Each of us has a responsibility to cultivate vigilance, self-denial, and faith. If people commit to that, they will become an army that can fight the enemy and win.</p>

        <p>I think it depends on each individual country. </p>
<p>Some used as an excuse for power grab (Spain, France)</p>
<p>Some genuinely freaked out and perhaps tried to cover up the sad state of their health services, despite high taxes (Italy, Canada) </p>
<p>Some we’re infected by sheep mentality and copied what other countries were doing (Mexico, Chile) </p>
<p>Others used it to repress protests (Hong Kong, gillets jaunes in France) </p>
<p>Some had an opposition party accusing them of genocide if they didn’t lockdown, and had a hypochondriac population (UK) </p>
<p>Others saw it as a way to delay or manipulate votes (Democratic states in USA, New Zealand) </p>
<p>Some did it to show they were not like Trump (many Europeans might fit here - Greece, Portugal) </p>
<p>Others dug themselves into a whole by sponsoring panic (Peru?)</p>
<p>Some held out but eventually caves in to global pressure (Switzerland) </p>
<p>Some did it out of fear of China (Japan, Taiwan) </p>
<p>Some had destroyed the economy and saw this ad the perfect excuse to pin the blame elsewhere ( Argentina for sure) </p>
<p>And then there’s the WHO... hard to know there but they’re certainly in China’s pocket. </p>
<p>Mexico’s President said this crisis fit him ‘like a ring to the finger’, meaning he now has the perfect culprit for his disastrous economic policies. He was the only one dumb enough to say it aloud, but I think something of this sort went to most politicians minds. </p>
<p>Also, let’s not forget most politicians are power hungry and petty. They simply couldn’t resist rubbing their power on people’s faces. ‘Oh, you’re the CEO of McDonalds? Let’s see what your money can do against my random regulations! You close when I tell you, sell what I say, muzzle your employees or is game over!’ This sort of power is intoxicating.</p>

        <p>Money and control.</p>
<p>Mandatory vaccines means BIG money. Now they convince the public they will need 4 per year. $200*population*4 --- think how much money that would be.</p>
<p>Next, the government loves this. Free control. It isn't going to go back. Once one mandatory vaccine comes you'll have them for everything you can imagine. Unsafe or not.. actually necessary or not.</p>
<p>The masks were just to get us to start saying "yes mam" to soften the required vaccine.</p>
<p>It won't be required right away, but eventually businesses will deny you if you don't have a vaccine certificate or digital health card, which we are all sure is coming.</p>

        <p>Ok, vaccines might mean big money but considering how much they have already lost is it really worthy? The argument for big money coming from vaccines doesn’t really speak to me as they have countless of other sources to make big money without making some stupid performance lasting for months.</p>

        <p>"They" haven't lost any money.</p>
<p>- The big retailers have made bank because small businesses (AKA the competition) have been destroyed.</p>
<p>- Online delivery and Amazon are making bank because people are too afraid to shop in meat world due to all of the fearmongering.</p>
<p>- As the economy dies, all of the seized and repossessed assets (like homes) will come up on the market for pennies on the dollar - to be held and flipped for profit later.</p>
<p>- Tech companies are making a killing building our new social credit/surveillance dystopia.</p>
<p>- "They" have bought our governments, lock, stock, and barrel. In return for the unlimited powers now being seized, governments are going to kick bailouts to their crony-capitalist masters, paid for by you (see airlines for an example).</p>

        <p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>A big part of Agenda 21/Agenda 2030 is to force citizens out of rural and suburban areas into super-dense mega-cities, and allow most of the remaining land to go "back to nature". This land will be off-limits, except to the privileged few.</p>
<p>This is sold as a "Green" initiative, but in reality is about profit and about easier control and surveillance of the plebs - who will live in rabbit-hutches in the sky, always under the loving gaze of Big Brother.</p>
<p>Destroying the concept of property rights, and crashing the economy so people lose their homes and the land can be scooped up by governments and the connected, is a tool to accomplish this re-ordering of society by the elites.</p>

        <p>It might seem like it defies all logic until you realize that the pool of controllers in the world is actually extremely small compared with the world's population and getting smaller by the day. Governments are actually near the bottom of the power hierarchy.  What's happening now has been pre-planned for decades, they just had to wait for all the pieces of the technological puzzle to be put in place.</p>

        <p>The U.S. is the last barrier against worldwide socialism and the NWO. The virus allowed the election to have no clear winner. Both sides that voted are angry and there will be a civil war regardless of the outcome. Military state will be the answer. Prolonged virus will destroy economy and put everyone into the same boat. Mandatory chipping with vaccine to receive benefits. Dissenters not killed during civil war will be quarantined in camps and killed.

        <p>I agree, but the problem is in the completely incoherent response by governments and the ridiculous cheerleading by the media that is supposed to hold them accountable.  People telling you to follow the science believe its ok to eat chicken wings at a bar before 10, while doing it afterwards will kill us all. </p>
<p>I mean we live in a world where people make fun of qanon believers, while simultaneously understanding the death of Jeffery epstein and the hit on the maxwell judge's family are entirely illogical events that didn't happen on their own. Im not saying I believe every part of it, but the idea that there are pedophiles in high places shouldn't be a crazy idea any more.</p>
<p>Same with people that don't want to believe there's anything insidious going on with lockdowns. These events are entirely illogical,  and so people are naturally going to try to make sense of them any way they can.</p>

        <p>One of my theories is that China is deliberately destroying the West, Western society was in such a vulnerable state that they took the bait easily. There isn't a doubt in my mind that China lied by first making them believe that this virus was way more deadly than it actually is and then providing the "solution" to such a "terrible threat"... lockdowns and everything they entail, including masks, social distancing, contact tracing, the whole dystopian hellscape. Oh, the lockdown didn't work? You still haven't eradicated covid yet? That's because you didn't do it right! You need to lockdown harder, longer, more stringently! Oh you <em>still</em> haven't gotten rid of covid? That's because people aren't doing what they're told, they aren't following the rules! Now lockdown again harder, even more draconian policies. This is the never-ending cycle of stupidity and insanity that China fed the West, and they are gleefully eating it up. P.S. I don't believe China ever had an actual lockdown. They just fed the West a series of inane propaganda images and that was all it took. It's cunning, masterful, and straight out of The Art of War. The fact that something as absurd as lockdowns is now seen as a totally normal and sane response, backed by "science" speaks volumes about what went down here. It's overnight reprogramming. Psychological warfare. The fact that all these countries fell for it says a multitude of things about how their governments, media, population, and society.</p>

Played to an audience that has been primed for years to the dopamine addiction of virtue signaling,  it worked beautifully. As soon as the corporations that truly control the governments saw that they could make bank while destroying their rivals, everything came together in a perfect storm.</p>

        <p>It just doesn't make sense that the West would want to destroy their own economies, no matter what anyone says. That they want to usher in a new world order hellscape filled with lockdowns and stopping travel/world economy. That their main motive in that scenario would be power,just doesn't hold up...because they would be rulers of an economic wasteland. This is why my main theory is that this is the work of China. You see, China doesn't want a physical war. They don't want something so costly and destructive to themselves. Remember what The Art of War says: "The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. The greatest victory is one which requires no battle. No nation benefits from prolonged warfare." China has destroyed the West in the most effective way possible...a war with weapons of the mind.</p>

        <p>Yes, I agree. What I suspect is muddying the waters though is a big chunk of opportunism from the pharmaceuticals. A world where people are terrified of viruses and happy to be vaccinated, perhaps several times a year, looks very attractive to them and I am sure they are maneuvering behind the scenes. Otherwise it is hard to see why governments are so blinkered. In the UK, Chief Scientific Adviser Vallance has £600K of GSK shares, for example, which may influence his judgement.</p>

        <p>Certainly there are people in power in the West (Big Med/Pharma, politicians, corporations, etc) that enjoy what is going on because they think it is strengthening them and they are using it for their own agendas and gain. But in the grand scheme of things, they too are being played as there is no benefit to Western countries in any way, as the ultimate goal is to destroy. This is where the Art of War comes in again..."fuel and encourage your enemies' arrogance"...and let them drown in their own hubris.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>National bankruptcies caused by loss of tax revenues and inflation due to out of control money printing. Rampant poverty even among middle classes, starvation in developing countries. Collapse of law and order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the collapse of the world economy, NWO to helpfully put forward the idea of a worldwide communist technocracy where the money is a digital social credit, and personal property has been abolished (unless you are part of the elite). This will be supported by the MSM and the sheep in a great propaganda drive.</p>

<li>

        <p>If you had to answer the question why, why do they exactly need it for? Why would someone need a surveillance over people? Why would they care about mere individual? What exactly this sort of control and power gives them? </p>
<p>Because for the long run it does not make any sense, people used to fight countless of times in the world and such operations do not succeed. Communism in Eastern Europe didn’t, countless of revolutions history remembers. I might be naive but I think it’s essential to try to answer a very simple question, why exactly would anyone want that control and what in practice is the benefit for them. Except for the feeling of being powerful there is nothing else and to get to that feeling they need to do a lot, it doesn’t feel worthy. I want to know your standpoint</p>

        <p>Communism in China is extremely successful. People keep giving the example of Eastern Europe without ever realising that the NWO allowed Soviet communism to fall, because it was time for the EU to take over from there.</p>
<p>As to why they want to create a worldwide prison, I and many other people know exactly why, but that's very advanced conspiracy knowledge that really goes to the heart of the matter, and it's not for this kind of forums. People simply aren't ready to receive that information.</p>

        <p>I dont think all of the big businesses willingly decided to give up massive sums of money this year out of the goodness of their hearts, they did so with the understanding that their small business competitors would be hamstrung.  Those companies are expecting a return on that investment,  which is why the US elections simply could not be allowed to play out naturally. 
Theres simply no logical reason why the events of 2020 happened the way that they did without engineering.<br>
Here in the US,  we are told that this is some civilization threatening event that requires totalitarian measures to eradicate,  despite every shred of evidence that exists telling us that it isn't.  Further and further extreme measures are needed to combat this plague, from basic mask wearing and now moving into telling the government your every move.
Rather than a journalistic media, we have a propaganda arm of a particular worldview,  thus eradicating the usual means that free societies fight against this sort of lunacy. Any dissenting ideas are censored and canceled,  out of fear of "misinformation ", without the slightest shred of irony about enforcing intellectual echo chambers. All of the aforementioned groups have created a single monolithic entity, all tied together to create a new world and ruthlessly enforce the new agreed upon orthodoxy. 
In short, its a globalist coup attempt across the western world. The goal is to destroy any vestige of tradition and identity to create a singular mono culture, and it's extremely depressing how close we are to letting them pull it off.</p>

        <p>I think it’s simpler than many say...it started as a bunch of misinformation (from China), progressed to scary stories out of Italy (before they knew best ways to treat it) and (most) everyone was on board for the initial lockdown due to those things. Then liberals realized it was a golden opportunity to damage Trump...so they doubled down. When info arose this summer showing the virus was far less dangerous than thought, liberals tripled and quadrupled down. Cheered on by the media (of course). Liberal  governors toed the line, conservative governors tried to hold out but then panicked at media criticism and caved. It was never going to stop before the Nov election, and now they are in far too deep to just “poof!” drop it all..so it will be a gradual process. That is truly it. As for other countries- they are far FAR more influenced by the US (and US media) than people think. Basically- there is no “real cause”...it has just been a cascade of misinformation and no one wants to think all the time spent on it was “all for nothing” so it’s hard to find a way out now...a vaccine will be a great “excuse” to end it, because they don’t know how to do so otherwise.</p>

        <p>The idea of an exit strategy is really interesting.  I'm not sure if there is one or not, but surely even the most totalitarian politicians out there can't think this is sustainable forever. How they plan on getting out of it while maintaining any credibility though I'm not sure. Then again, they don't really need to, as modern media is essentially just the propaganda department for them.</p>
<p>This can conceivably end any time they want it to, most people wouldn't even know anything was going on if it weren't for the constant fear mongering.</p>

        <p>&rt;...can't think this is sustainable forever.</p>
<p>What if it is? This is what terrifies me the most.</p>
<p>There are many things we do every day that once may have some basis in them, but now are completely pointless. We don't think about them, but we do them anyway. For example: wearing ties, taking hat off when inside, saying "god bless," etc.</p>
<p>So, what if this <em>can</em> be sustained forever in this way? By turning it into something we <em>just do</em>, something we <em>just say</em> and something we <em>just think</em>.</p>

        <p>My guess as far as the economy is going is the powers that be wanted an easy way to reorganise companies to work-from-home status then kill all the jobs no longer needed at the buildings. the top execs wouldn't care about the people out of work (out of sight/out of mind). I've wondered why now in this particular pandemic given we didn't shut most the world down for HIV, SARS, MERS, H1N1, etc. The business reorganisation is the only one I can come up with. Pair it up with an easy way for people to switch to cashless ('eeww cash is dirty!') then you got everyone tracked so there is easy control (threaten to cut their accounts off). Same for identities (chip all the ID cards then link it to the bank accounts then if either goes invalid, no access to society). Scary stuff!</p>

        <p>I think there are many causes, but all of them essentially boil down to war between elites and the masses.</p>
<p>We are at war. It's a bit different from wars of the past, but that doesn't change the meaning.</p>
<p>It's a serious attempt to create NWO and implement their Great Reset essentially turning the whole world into totalitarian prison planet. Prison where corporations and multinationals own and rule everything. It also implies complete destruction of our society and what's left of already diminishing democracy.</p>

        <p>I see the lockdowns being a test for how to fix climate change. San Francisco is already proposing that those who can work from home do so at least 3 days a week to help. And population control. The less people on this earth, the less climate change speeds up.</p>

        <p>It’s a very American-sided point of view and I must criticise it. America is not a centre of the world and not everything, not to mention every action evolves around this country. Yes, it is a big and powerful country just like China while China has grown to lead in the past decades; but I do not think such mess could be created only because China is not a Trump supporter lol. </p>
<p>Unless you also suggest it was a small conspiracy plan and it has grown out of control into a chain of reactions.</p>

        <p>Sorry I should’ve explained myself better. I think China’s original plan was to overtake all nations in terms of economy and power. Trump is part of this. He is a no-nonsense leader and I think the USA was able to latch on to this to get trump out. As for other nations, I honestly think it is a combination of power, vaccination money (in the case of England) and other factors.</p>

        <p>Edit: thank you guys for taking your time and writing so many great responses. It’s especially nice to see it as most of them seem to have a very complex and reasonable way of thinking gracefully avoiding crossing the line of some idiotic, 5G-kind of conspiracy talk. It proves that most of us have a strong criticism against all of it and we can prove a justified position against all of this. We can give a lot of arguments while the “panicked” ones keep on throwing same-old-expired words at us with no analytical background. Ironically, one of those old gold lines is under covering behind “I follow the science” whilst that “science” is usually written by a selective, government-paid clique of “scientists” therefore mass media present a very narrow minded selection of articles that people take for the only truth and granted. I’m very happy so many of you responded, I still haven’t gone through everything but I will in a brief. Thank you!</p>

        <p>I don’t think that this pandemic was planned in advance in any way, but it’s being used as an excuse to gain more control over people, maybe because of the irrational fear of this virus. It’s being treated as Ebola, but in reality it’s much closer to your average flu for most people. </p>
<p>Now they’re desperate to keep that narrative cause reports are beginning to pop up saying that lockdowns do more harm than covid, that they’ve condemned an entire generation of children to disrupted education and decades of economic consequences. Just look at Boris Johnson’s reaction when Theresa May pointed this out to them in parliament the other day. He just got up and left, didn’t even retort. </p>
<p>Those responsible for these measures are doing what they can to save themselves. By now most of them are probably aware that this is a fuck-up of epic proportions, but if they acknowledge it that would be political suicide in most countries.</p>

        <p>Few days ago I was checking how fast over population was increasing. Maybe the ones in power saw this oppurtunity as  a way to enforce lockdowns and potentially kill off the ones in exteme poverty with starvation. This is exactly what's happening right now. Since lockdown starvation and deaths from starvation are rapidly increasing than ever before. Before COVID and lockdowns there was said to be 135 million people in extreme poverty and starvation, now after the lockdowns, the number doubled to 270 million. All of this is causing a global economic crisis and killing the ones who are too poor to help themselfs.</p>

        <p>My own theory? There is no big conspiracy. At least not to the Illuminati/NWO extent some people seem to think. Yes, I find the overlap between COVID-19, Event 201, ID 2020, the Great Reset, Johns Hopkins, Bill Gates, and the World Economic Forum extremely suspicious. But I also believe, as coordinated as this all may be, that this is no more than nature running its course. Behavioral sink, the social cycle, the runaway reaction that is the corrupting power of....power. Our leaders are human just like us, but their influence and affluence makes them so far removed from the day-to-day needs and wants of us peasants that they no longer seem human. And they will continue to pursue influence and affluence until even they begin to suffer from the negative effects of their corruption.</p>
<p>Civilizations rise and fall. Large nations grow unstable under the weight of their own population density and sociocultural diversity, fracturing into smaller communities of shared interest, only to coagulate into large nations once again. Rinse and repeat. We can't all unite under one flag, we can't all genuinely give a fuck about each other, not without those fucks growing shallow and hollow. To believe otherwise is folly. As close as we may seem in our cities and suburbs, we are distant in our wants and needs. Big centralized governments and megacorporations grow especially distant as they rise to power, distant as the mountaintop is from the river valley. Even if they didn't want or need to crush us beneath their boots in their constant instinctive pursuit of some intangible peak of power, they physically cannot genuinely care for us. No more than their virtue-signalling hive-minded footsoldiers genuinely care about thousands or millions or even billions of total strangers dying from any cause so long as it spares them and their loved ones.</p>

        <p>My personal theory is that the goal is to get people to accept cashless society. Play up the fear, get people afraid to handle the "dirty covid" money, they'll be less likely to fight against going cashless.
Once we are cashless, they can really rake in the taxes i.e. yard sales, previously unclaimed income, etc. which means more power over the masses and more money lining their filthy rich pockets.</p>

<p>Whitmer (Michigan) accidentally let it slip a while back, she said “if you’re sick of masks, if you want to go back to church, vote for Biden.”  How much more transparent can you get?  The US COVID response, specifically, was absolutely political in nature.</p>

        <p>To separate people! The strategy employed here is the well known "divide and conquer". Like when you and your little group of chums at school got sat at different tables so you couldn't talk to each other. Divided, and so quiet.</p>
<p>This is what's happening now. Things like art, music, hospitality etc have been shut down as they bring people together. We've literally been locked up to be separated from each other. Masks obscure people's faces so make it harder to connect with them!</p>
<p>And if we can't come together then we can't protest and fight for our rights and freedoms back.</p>
<p>Also another theory: war.</p>
<p>Wars are started to make money - for those who sell weapons etc. They also instill fear within people. Now, war propaganda has been looked at critically since WW2, so if they started another war people wouldn't go fight - knowing the horrors of the previous wars. They'd find excuses not to, use some "health issue" to say no.</p>
<p>Sooo, they've effectively done the same thing by using our utter worship for health and safety against us! We are scared, and the people selling masks/vaccines make all the money. Ta-daaa, we're at war against ourselves essentially, we were never at war with the virus.</p>
<p>We should, however, be at war with the government!</p>

        <p>I don't believe this was a conspiracy--not because I have faith in the powerful, but because I think it's simpler than that. I believe this is more of a mass panic akin to the Salem witch trails. People were rightfully scared before there were good numbers and they haven't been able to switch it off. It would look bad for any government leader to say "oops we were wrong" after inflicting so many unnecessary restrictions, so they aren't going to. In the US, there's also the contributing factor of anything bad being something that can be used against Trump, and therefore not truly wanting things to get better. The same doomerism mindset that affects everyday people has affected those in power as well. So I don't think it was a conspiracy, but a deeply troubling result of human psychology and a modern mindset of not being used to any sort of hardship, which in a sense could be even worse.</p>

        <p>The motive for COVID doesn’t make sense mostly because it doesn’t need to make sense. The Black Death did not benefit the governments of the time, it had no motives, and did nothing for the rich and powerful. It did not need to make any sense. The world is chaotic, disease has always been a part of human history, and our modern infrastructure made it so that a pandemic was easy to achieve from a Plague Inc. point of view.</p>
