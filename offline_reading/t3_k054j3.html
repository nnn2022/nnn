    <strong>The "mask reversal" trend is going to be interesting.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know what other term fits.</p>
<p>Considering how masks have become the norm now (even those idiots who wear them outside when there's not a SINGLE person around), it's going to be interesting to see what interaction is like once masks are no longer a requirement in stores.</p>
<p>People are going to be so used to wearing masks that once they stop becoming the norm, you're going to have people condemning others for breaking the trend. Especially because people have been using this time to show how "morally superior" they are to others by wearing a mask.</p>
<p>I feel like even after we get a vaccine and all that, masks are still going to be around for a long time and will probably be the last thing to go. It's becoming so ingrained in our society to walk into a store and see a bunch of medicalized zombies.</p></p>

        <p>There will be millions of germaphobes out there for years to come.  When you spend eight months instilling fear in people, don't be surprised when the fear lingers even after you give them the all-clear.</p>

        <p>I was working at a retail store yesterday, and in the employee break room (which is all the way in the corner of the store and 100% away from customers) there was a woman sitting at the table with a laptop. Not only did she still have a mask on in the break room, but she was wearing blue hazard gloves and had a bunch of paper towels laid out on the table so that she wouldn't come in contact with touching the table, lol. </p>
<p>Germaphobe is an understatement.</p>

        <p>Keep an eye on Melbourne Victoria Australia, reversed (mostly) this week. Lingering insecurity and inclination to panic but most youngish adults are just getting on with it and embracing their old life. I shudder to think of the mind fuck this will be in children.</p>

        <p>I would never be able to return to normal in Melbourne. To be honest I am probably too messed up to do so here. This happened and the realization that it can all be gone in a moment makes even things unaffacted seem like they will be lost soon.</p>

        <p>I am so happy you know about cPTSD, this is awareness and fuel. You absolutely do not have to accept the state of the world, but you can still accept yourself :) Not trying to be all woo, just, having your own sense of congruence will help you get back to strength! Have you tried 'cPTSD - From Surviving to Thriving' by Pete Walker? It's like the cPTSD bible. Richard Grannon is also great on YouTube for this, and he's a skeptic too.</p>
<p>We're all going through complex trauma at the moment, how freaking awesome to be ahead of the curve and doing whatever we can to better ourselves. The world is full of totalitarians, how cool to have the brass balls to reject it with a strong sense of your own temperament, boundaries, and emotional content.</p>
<p>You're already a badass, so you can make a life that works within your own internal locus of control. Either way, better sad and aware of it, than unconscious totalitarian bed-wedding psychosis!</p>

        <p>This is nuts, but I looked into it and the mayor said he expects to repeal it in the Spring and mainly wants to come at it from the angle of finally getting rid of them altogether rather than having extensions every month. Still wrong but he at least made it very clear it’s not meant to last until end of year (not that we can trust any politicians).</p>
<p>On the local news article about it there were actually more people getting upvoted bashing it and saying it’s time to move on and that doomers need to stop blaming others, so that was refreshing.</p>

        <p>The second the workplace mandate goes away and exposing my bare face is no longer a fireable offense/workplace political suicide, I'm tossing every mask I have into the trash or possibly the fire pit.</p>
<p>A lot of people are going to continue clinging to them because they've become security blankets for them.  That's fine with me, they can do whatever the fuck they want.  Just as long as they don't force everyone else to do it too.</p>

        <p>I hate wearing mine, but unfortunately I have to as I travel a lot and flights require them. But I don’t wear it anytime I get a chance, and when walking into a new business I don’t wear one until they ask me to. A few businesses if I can tell from the frequency and number of signs that they are mask nazis I’ll just throw it on to save the bother of a confrontation. As soon as I sit down in the restaurant the magical Covid barrier goes up so I can take it off. And I never wear a mask when leaving a business. What are they gonna do, kick me out?</p>

        <p>I keep a mask on me but I never put it on in stores. If I'm asked its just a "oh shoot sorry forgot!" And I slip it on. I almost never get asked about it though. Unless it's target or costco. They are pretty strict</p>

        <p>I cannot wait for the day I get to cut my masks up and trash them. I will probably hang on to disposable ones a little while longer for any “essential” business still clinging to mask rules. But as soon as the mandate expires all my fabric masks will be in the garbage.</p>

        <p>They're mandatory in school and though I rarely wear mine it's kinda scary to be the only one, I'm surprised more people don't rebel! I hope I can give others the confidence to take it off since they won't be alone. See a bunch of wearing below noses which is a start I guess.</p>
<p>But yea, despite how we're at no risk some people are wearing them outside also.</p>

        <p>It'll be a huge relief for me. The thing that's been keeping me from going places is an uncertain mask policy. I can go to the grocery store and Home Depot without a mask and not get called out but other places might not be so lenient.</p>

        <p>Eh I don't really think so. No one likes wearing a mask. I feel like most people will drop them first chance they get. Though I can see it being more norm to wear them during flu season or when you're feeling sick like they do in Japan and South Korea.</p>

        <p>Some do, sure. They do also wear them to prevent spreading sickness. Because it's a lot of people crammed into a relatively small place diseases can spread very quickly. </p>

        <p>I’m gonna continue wearing a mask, even if it isn’t required, because if 2020 has taught me anything it’s that people are disgusting and stupid, and I don’t want to breathe the same air as y’all.</p>

        <p>I love how you idiots back your anti mask rhetoric with claims that “it’s a personal choice” and that mandates are “limiting your freedoms” but that you also usually happen to be pro-life.</p>
<p>If you can’t see the irony, then I would indeed find your existence to be both entertaining and terrifying.</p>
