    <strong>Random thoughts from a college student</strong>
    <p><p>I've just recently had so much on my mind and sometimes I feel like I have nowhere to go without my feelings just being thrown out the window. I'm a 21 year old male still in college. I just arguably came of my worst school year academically of my whole life. Covid shutting down school made me withdraw from all of my classes. I've been dealing with depression and coming close to suicide from all the stress that can come from being a student.</p>
<p>Around December/January I decided to seek therapy and finally get help and it was one of the best decisions of my life. I really felt like even though I struggled with school my eyes opened and I wanted to get better for myself. I finally started making friends and for the first time ever I felt like I allowed myself to be me and get the college experience for better or worse. I felt like I got the new normal I've always wanted. Met a girl I like, make new friends, and not staying in my dorm stress eating all the time. </p>
<p>March ended up being one of my most stressful months ever trying to recover and get through my classes while being forced to be sent home with my narcissistic mother and taking my classes online sent me back down to a very dark place. All my friends gone just like that. My whole life I was building back up just taken away from me like that. I truly lost myself once again.</p>
<p>Going home to being told I can't go anywhere literally for months just because they were that scared of the virus. I couldn't even throw the football with my best friend who I haven't seen in months just because my mom thought it wasn't safe. I'm pretty sure people would just tell me I'm a selfish bitch for being mad at that and that I should be ashamed. Why should I not feel like this when my entire world was just taken away.</p>
<p>Trying to find out what I wanna do with my life being stalled because idk if things will ever be the same. I probably won't even graduate on time considering the amount of online classes they want us to take.</p>
<p>I'm officially moving in to my dorm once again for next school year. I'm hoping for some kind of normalcy in hopes I can be motivated once again to be a better student. I don't want all the fear mongering my mom has put on me trying to keep me home to actually come true. I feel like not being scared of the virus is seen as a bad thing. Why should I be scared to want to go back to normal.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for the long post. I just really want to write my thoughts out. I was able to get out of my dark place and luckily find myself again before the new school year. I feel like my mental health is great, but I feel like this "new normal" could tear it down really quick and it won't be long before I'm told to just deal with it by the same people who claim to be for better mental health. I just want things to get better, but it often feels like people want to live in this type of fear forever. I just can't take it anymore.</p></p>

        <p>I'm just another stranger on the internet, and an old one at that.  Maybe I can help you, maybe I can't.</p>
<p>Here's the thing:  you still have your humanity.  You value relationship and human society.  You are beginning to see that the lockdown, the "new normal", is a frontal attack on all that is good about humanity.</p>
<p>Hold onto that, never doubt it, and it will serve you as a light in the darkness.</p>
<p>Nobody can promise you that the world will ever get better.  If it does, you will emerge a stronger person for having gone through this.  If it doesn't, you will still have your humanity as the ship goes down.  That's more than a great many people will have at the end of all this.</p>

        <p>Thanks, realizing my humanity is the only thing that's gotten me this far. I'm hoping it can take me further to where I need to be, even in these tough times.</p>

        <p>Covid did not shut down your school. Government tyrants shut down your school. </p>
<p>Be precise. Tell the truth. Insist others do the same. </p>
<p>It helps.</p>

        <p>Hey man it sucks that it happened just when everything was starting to get better for you. You’re at an age where you’re developing a lot and having this dumb thing stalling everything would be hard. </p>
<p>You can always trust Time though. Time really does heal everything. There is no chance for this to go on forever. It’s just a matter of how long the hysteria is prolonged by the annoying people who don’t check the facts. But people always stop caring about things as time passes, this will be no different. Think about any other major event. They all pass. It’s just hard to see right now we’re in the midst of it. </p>
<p>Until then, I’m looking forward to getting a game console and playing some games I’ve missed. I’m sure the social part is hard though. Also you could try an inward journey, learning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/94e17b/5_tips_to_be_more_mindful_for_beginners/?utm_source=xpromo&amp;utm_medium=amp&amp;utm_name=amp_comment_iterations&amp;utm_term=active&amp;utm_content=post_body">mindfulness</a> helped me at your age. It’s kind of fun journey to discover and can keep you occupied with just your mind. I just put on my favorite ambient soundtrack and go on a mental journey. </p>
<p>Hopefully you’re able to get more normalcy back at school, and the restrictions will drop away as people adhere to them poorly anyways and realize how superficial and ridiculous they are (wear a mask between the restaurant door and table lmao).</p>

        <p>The feelings you feel are eminently relatable.
This "new normal" is anything but that.</p>
<p>Be proud of what you did in January. And know that you can do it and more again. Many other people are longing for that actual new normal you achieved. Especially around your age.</p>
