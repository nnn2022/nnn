        <p>Ding ding ding! Here, check out a perfect example of mass hysteria that exemplfies what's happening right the fuck now:</p>
<p>The Seattle Windshield Pitting EPIDEMIC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_windshield_pitting_epidemic</p>
<p>"The Seattle windshield pitting epidemic is a phenomenon which affected Bellingham, Seattle, and other communities of Washington state in April, 1954; it is considered an example of a mass delusion.[1] It was characterized by widespread observation of previously unnoticed windshield holes, pits and dings, leading residents to believe that a common causative agent was at work. It was originally thought to be the work of vandals but the rate of pitting was so great that residents began to attribute it to everything from sand flea eggs to nuclear bomb testing.
Originating in Bellingham in March, police initially believed the work to be vandals using BB guns. However the pitting was soon observed in the nearby towns of Sedro Woolley and Mount Vernon and by mid-April, appeared to have spread to the town of Anacortes on Fidalgo Island.
Within a week, the news and the so-called "pitting epidemic" had reached metropolitan Seattle. As the newspapers began to feature the story, more and more reports of pitting were called in. Motorists began stopping police cars to report damage. Car lots and parking garages reported particularly severe attacks.
Several hypotheses for the widespread damage were postulated:
Some thought that a new million-watt radio transmitter at nearby Jim Creek Naval Radio Station was producing waves that caused physical oscillations in glass;
Some believed it to be the work of cosmic rays;
Some reported seeing glass bubbles form right before their eyes, believing it to be the work of sand fleas.
By April 15, close to 3,000 windshields had been reported as affected. Mayor Allan Pomeroy contacted Washington Governor Arthur B. Langlie, then President Dwight D. Eisenhower asking for assistance.[2]
Finally, Sergeant Max Allison of the Seattle police crime laboratory stated that the pitting reports consisted of "5 per cent hoodlum-ism, and 95 per cent public hysteria." By April 17, the pitting suddenly stopped.
The "Seattle Windshield Pitting Epidemic" as it is called has become a textbook case of collective delusion (not "mass hysteria" as reported).[3] Although natural windshield pitting had been going on for some time, it was only when the media called public attention to it that people actually looked at their windshields and saw damage they had never noticed before."</p>

<p>What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>&rt;If you ask for evidence of efficacy of policies to justify the lockdown of the entire world and get called a "science denier"... it might be mass hysteria. </p>
<p>The efficacy of mask-wearing and lock downs is well understood and well proven. </p>
<p>&rt;When you have to wear a mask upon entering a restaurant only to immediately remove it at the table or, worse, are expected to keep it on between bites of food... it might be mass hysteria. </p>
<p>I'll concede this point, it seems like security theater to me and I work in a restaurant. </p>
<p>&rt;When every policy that every expert crafted for pandemics over decades go out the window in a matter of months and are replaced by radical and untested policies of complete societal shutdown... it might be mass hysteria.</p>
<p>What's this in reference to? I know that Trump got rid of the pandemic response team set up by Bush and Obama as well as their response protocol but I haven't heard anything else about any other countries.</p>
<p>&rt;If you ask why the entire world has shut down and people's livelihood and mental health are being destroyed for a year all because of a virus with a 99.7% survivability rate (which is far higher than a lot of viruses that humans have dealt with over the millenia) and get called crazy and selfish... it might be mass hysteria. </p>
<p>This is... plainly ignorant,  and that's me being as nice as possible to you. By the way the entire world hasn't shut down at all, most of  the countries that were mature and had adult rational responses are doing extremely well right now, like Vietnam, s. Korea, Japan, China. </p>
<p>Even with all of the measures we've taken we've lost more people in 10 months then we lost in 4 years in World War II. Hello, McFly?</p>
<p>It should be plainly and overtly obvious why we are doing what we are doing, furthermore your absurd survival rate statistic goes right out the window as soon as hospitals begin filling up - and that's not even to account for the fact that once hospitals are stressed in that manner then people begin dying more and more from every imaginable cause of death.</p>

        <p>Gonna need a source on proof that lockdowns do anything but delay the inevitable and make poor people poorer.</p>
<p><a href="https://thefatemperor.com/published-papers-and-data-on-lockdown-weak-efficacy-and-lockdown-huge-harms/">22</a> studies showing 0 link between lockdown stringency and COVID mortality. Not even a correlation, let alone causation.</p>
<p>Can't trust China's numbers and South Korea and Japan are seeing their inevitable rise in cases, as expected.</p>
<p>And as for the pandemic guidelines being thrown out the door, <a href="https://twitter.com/boriquagato/status/1280990976694083585">this thread</a> does a good job of explaining it. Almost everything we've accepted as common sense this year flies in the face of all existing literature prior to this year. My first link has the 2019 WHO guidelines, if you want to read it too.</p>
<p>And as for the "absurd survival rate":</p>
<p>The global IFR (which goes off total infected, not just confirmed) is somewhere between <a href="https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/">0.1 and 0.5%</a>.</p>
<p>The most recent of those studies is from John Ioannidis who recently settled on a global IFR of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13423">0.15-0.20% overall and 0.03-0.04% for those &lt;70 years old</a>.</p>
<p>If you prefer the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html">CDC</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0-19 years: 0.003%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20-49 years: 0.02%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50-69 years: 0.5%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>70+ years: 5.4%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/05/who-10percent-of-worlds-people-may-have-been-infected-with-virus-.html">WHO</a> also recently estimated that 10% of the global population may have already had COVID, which at the time would've implied an IFR of 0.13%.</p>

        <p>Lol 800,000 Americans died on WWII. So even your panic stat is bullshit. Please compare disease deaths to disease deaths. 600,000 people die of heart disease every year. So we ban fast food? If the media had a running count every day of everyone that died of cancer or heart disease it would be way scarier than covid. As to the rest of what you say, there is zero research that shows lockdowns or mask mandates rice covid rates in any way. You might think China is a good example but <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/us-intelligenceofficials-say-china-underreported-coronavirus-cases-deaths-report-1495566">US military intelligence doesn't</a>. And there's argument you can make that covid is even close to yellow fever, cholera, malaria, smallpox or AIDS in death rates and we never shut down society for nearly this long for any of those. I'm sorry if covid gives us a slightly higher than normal risk of death, but do like your ancestors did and keep calm and carry on. Stop cowering in fear</p>

        <p>If hospitals were so extremely overwhelmed, or at risk of being overwhelmed, why isn't the military being activated to help deal with the crisis?</p>
<p>The military specializes in pop-up health care operations. Seems logical rather than continuing to lockup healthy people.</p>

        <p>True... the reason however it did 'not get used' is because that hospital ship was not set up to do ventilators.</p>
<p>That is a little 'zinger' that the people who worked on the ship made clear.</p>

        <p>NYT January 8th: "There is no evidence that the virus is readily spread by humans"</p>
<p>WHO January 14: On Twitter "Peliminary investigations have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China</p>
<p>January 21: We get the very first reported coronavirus patient reported in the US: CDC</p>
<p>January 22: Dr. Fauci told Newsmax's Greg Kelly, "This is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is notsomething that the citizens of the United States should be worried about right now."</p>
<p>January 26: Dr. Fauci again, this time in an interview with John Catsimatidis. "It's a very, very low risk to the United States"</p>
<p>January 28: BuzzFeed News, "Don't worry about the Coronavirus.  Worry about the Flu."</p>
<p>January 31: Vox News on Twitter "Is this going to be a deadly pandemic?  No."</p>
<p>January 31: The Washington Post, "How our brains make Coronavirus seem scarier than it is"</p>
<p>Janurary 31: Trump, in direct defiance to the liberal media, liberal politicians, and WHO, begins blocking travel to and from China.</p>
<p>He gets called xenophobic and paranoid by several people in the democratic party.  This can be looked up on Google very easily.</p>
<p>January 31: CNN "As the Coronavirus spreads, fear is fueling racism and xenophobia"</p>
<p>February 2nd: NYC Health Commissioner "...the risk to New Yorkers for Coronavirus is low and our city preparedneess is high. There is no reason not to take the subway, not to take the bus..."</p>
<p>February 3: The Washington Post, "Why we should be wary of an aggressive government response to Coronavirus"</p>
<p>February 5: The New York Times, "Who says it's not safe to travel to China?  The Coronavirus travel ban is unjust and doesn't work anyway."</p>
<p>On February 24, Pelosi told people that Chinatown was safe and that she hoped people would come to hang out.  She and everyone else was there without masks and told people to come join her.</p>
<p>February 26:  New york Times "Let's call it Trumpvirus. If you're feeling awful, you kno who to blame."</p>
<p>March 2: Bill de Blasio on Twitter, "Since I'm encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus, I thought I would offer some suggestions.  Here's the first: thru Thurs 3/5 go see "The Traitor" u/FilmLinc. If "The Wire" was a true story + set in Italy, it would be this film.</p>
<p>March 2: NY Governor Andrew Cuomo, "...when you're saying what happened in other countries vs. what happened here, we don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries."</p>
<p>March 4: CNN Anderson Cooper tells people to be more concerned about the flu than the coronavirus.</p>
<p>March 9: Forbes states, "Covid-19 travel update: Fauci says cruising is ok if you are healthy."</p>
<p>President Trump sent a Naval Hospital Ship to New York and California.  He had an emergency medical facility built in New York with over 2,000 beds.  He shipped over a thousand ventilators to New York.  Governor Cuomo announced on the air publicly that he would flat out refuse any and all help from Trump and he was true to his word- he didn't use ANY of that.  He instead signed executive orders along with the governors in Michigan, New Jersey, and a few other Democrat States that forced nursing homes to keep all covid patients indoors instead of sending them to hospitals.  This caused tens of thousands of deaths!</p>
<p>But yeah, keep blaming Trump for this.</p>

        <p>My friend just broke a bone.  Went into a clinic, got xrays, sent over xrays to main doc.  They requested follow up xrays the next Monday, then scheduled surgery for Tuesday, guess he was at risk of damaging an artery.  </p>
<p>The part that kinda surprised me was that they allow for covid test bypass for things like this.  So he was able to skip the test, and just walk in the front door, they don't take any secondary precautions considering they don't know his covid status.  They must either not have a quick turn around test, or they don't think its worth bothering with.  So clearly they can't think its that dangerous.</p>

        <p>See.. if you're a person of privilege and moderate power (ie a professional athlete) you really need to step up to the plate and call out this bullshit. Normal people don't have a platform to speak. And if playing sports is more important than speaking truth then that's bullshit. Of course not every athlete should come forward but it's really interesting how "most" professional athletes are completely silent on this whole matter.</p>

        <p>Tbh he probably has a much higher earning potential through his property development business. He (and Ryan Giggs) are behind a high profile mixed use residential/hotel/office/retail/restaurant tower development in Manchester which was meant to start construction at the beginning of 2020 after years of planning and legal challenges. As it stands lockdown has basically taken a shit over the business case for such a development and he probably has ever right to be miffed with a lot of sunk costs just in the planning phases.</p>

        <p>Of course I am, it's simple logical deduction. </p>
<p>Would you go to Michael Jordan if you needed a new transmission installed in your Sti? No...</p>
<p>How about if you needed a cavity filled? No.</p>
