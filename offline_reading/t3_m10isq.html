    <strong>My story about covid</strong>
    <p><p>Not that anyone cares, but I want to throw it out into the cyber realm. </p>
<p>When Covid first came out back January I was deathly afraid. There were videos of people dropping dead in the streets, dropping dead in ER in other countries and so forth. I had N95 on hand and was super scared. </p>
<p>I then had a contact with people who were infected before quarantine began. I didn’t get sick but I was fairly close and talked with them for 5-8 minutes. </p>
<p>Fast forward 4 months I lived normally and didn’t get sick. I decided to go to Disney world in august. I survived with no Covid. </p>
<p>I then decided to go back to Florida for a beach trip. Came back unscathed. Then a family member came over infected and lied to me they weren’t. Surprise, they were. We got sick. Two days of joint pain followed by three weeks of no taste and smell. Didn’t die didn’t need to be hospitalized luckily. </p>
<p>Now I’m in limbo. I’m immune (according to most science, yet still need a mask). I have lived normally since without worry. </p>
<p>I don’t get the restrictions on those who have had it. I am feeling great. After experiencing it first hand and seeing others have it from age 20-58 with same symptoms I’ve determined most of this is mindset. I’m not disrespecting those who die. I’m sure for certain blood types, weight classes, and immune systems this can be dangerous. However for most I think it’s overhyped and almost less than a flu like illness. </p>
<p>I guess without further ranting my point is, is that the restrictions don’t follow the way this illness is transmitted and that there is more fear than science behind this. </p>
<p>If it were me I’d open things fully and say don’t lie if you’re sick, and don’t share food and you should be 90-95% fine if not catching it, and if you are at risk continue current precautions. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading my post.</p></p>
