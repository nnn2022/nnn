    <strong>We need to wear masks and distance to flatten the curve, but also eliminate COVID? This doesn’t make sense.</strong>
    <p><p>I hope I’m not the only one who’s noticed this. This probably doesn’t make any sense but I’ll try and explain as best I can.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this, we were told we need to take these precautions to flatten the curve. I understand the concept, I’m not here to debate if it was a good move or not, I don’t know. That was what everyone was talking about. That’s why we had masks and distancing mandated.</p>
<p>Now, all I can hear about is “if everyone had followed the rules, we would have been opened back up by now.” I really don’t understand that. According to them, we wore masks to flatten the curve. That means it would have taken much longer for the virus to go through the population. So no, we wouldn’t have been done with this. This is a major inconsistency I’m finding with pro-lockdown arguments. </p>
<p>It’s almost like the “flatten the curve” idea suggested herd immunity and that’s why it was shut down. Let’s say flattening the curve worked. What do we do at the end of it? Is everyone immune? What happens when hospitalizations hit a low and stay there? I don’t know the answer to that but there’s a reason they stopped saying “flatten the curve” and that might be it. </p>
<p>I know there’s some holes in my thinking but this is really strange.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;The more we wear masks to slow the spread the faster this will all go away and we can return to normal!</p>
<p>Not sure these people understand math or time. Things happening over a longer period of time (i.e. slower) the longer it takes to happen. </p>
<p>Was just about to make a similar post to you after yet another doomer argued that point.</p>

        <p>Yeah so part of the problem is a lack of critical thinking on people's part and a serious lack of analysis regarding viruses and their propagation.</p>
<p>So yeah, flatten the curve was the reason at first so we don't swamp the hospitals and medical resources.  Hell we already saw pictures from NYC with patients in hallways and reports of people dropping dead in the ER waiting rooms and a perceived limited supply of masks and PPE for front line workers as well as ventilators for patients.</p>
<p>So flatten the curve was to address those issues.</p>
<p>But this idea of "if we'd only locked down completely we'd be over this shit already" is so beyond flawed that it's just a testament to how stupid people actually are and how many of them exist.</p>
<p>The only way we "get over this virus" is by herd immunity.  That's when enough people have antibodies to fight the virus so that when it tries to spread from one infected person to another, it can't find a new host and therefore dies off.  </p>
<p>This is the natural and normal progression of infectious diseases.  It's why we aren't still hearing about things like Swine Flu, West Nile Virus, Avian Flu, H1N1 and all that.  Sure they still exists in labs and occasionally you'll hear of a person getting infected but for the vast majority of the population, we're good.</p>
<p>How was that herd immunity reached for all those other viruses? <br>
NOT by social distancing.<br>
NOT by wearing masks.<br>
NOT by sheltering in place.<br>
NOT by any of the crap we see today with plastic barriers and things.</p>
<p>NO all of those died out because of herd immunity and that can only be reached by being exposed to the virus and developing antibodies.  Medications help and there's STRONG evidence to suggest HCQ+Zinc are a very effective combo in killing off the virus in our bodies should it get there.</p>

        <p>The majority of doomers are "white people," aka upper middle class US suburban liberals (not necessarily Caucasian.)  They all went to trendy liberal arts colleges and think that this makes their opinions on every subject matter correct and relevant.  In reality, they don't know anything about viruses or pandemic, so they don't see a contradiction.  Most have the same notion of viruses that a small child does and truly believe that the virus would have magically disappeared in April if everyone stayed locked in their houses.</p>

        <p>I think they thought if we all wore masks and distanced that nobody would get the virus anymore and it would just go away. Except it didn't work and hasn't worked since April. Virus too widespread.</p>
<p>They confused flattening the curve of hospitalizations to having no virus at all.</p>
<p>Even the models back then showed almost nobody being hospitalized by, was it August if social distancing continued through then. I very well remember seeing this on the charts at the time. Except here we are still social distancing in October! And will be for months more on end!</p>
<p>Now they are still in that mindset which is why we are stuck where we are. Except maybe for the idea that a vaccine will come very soon and still get rid of the virus. And then we can stop wearing masks and distancing.</p>

        <p>From the beginning this was never about eliminating a virus. I have been following vaccine health awareness for nearly 4 years and I can confidently say this has been planned. I am not sure how deep you want me to go into this, but looking at information apart from what government funded organisations tell you will give you a completely alternative message then what you may be told.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just answer you statement about "flattening the curve". The apparent purpose behind that was to stop the hospitals from being overrun because the imperial model made by Neil Ferguson. Spoiler is modelling was off by insane numbers. In Canada he predicted a death count of 320 000 and right now has a death rate of 9829. We should bear in mind this number includes people with pre existing cor-morbid illness, like different types of cancers, immue-compromised and elderly so take that as you will. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Flattening the curve also referred to no have a proper cure as well, so people who would become seriously ill would have no way of recovering, however we know know there is treatments for Sars-Covi-2. Hydroxy Chloroquien,  azithromycin, and zinc used in proper doses works as a treatment if used early enough, and doctor Richard Bartlett has had amazing success using a anti asthma inflamitory drug to treat Sars-covi-2 patients as well. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So to put this into perspective this is about a whole lot more then simply a virus</p>

<p>'Flatten the curve' and 'eliminate COVID' are different points on the same spectrum of goals we wish to achieve. Eliminate COVID is the gold standard, flatten the curve is the silver standard.</p>
<p>To use an analogy; if you're participating in a race, trying to beat your previous best, and trying to get first place are very different objectives, but you use the same method to try to achieve either or both.</p>
