        <p>it's too late for that, at least for me. My worldview has been indelibly changed. I knew there was evil in the power structures of the world and I knew most people were complacent and many were far from intelligent. </p>
<p>But the clear lies, data manipulation, propaganda and so on -- and not just people's inability to see through it, but their <em>unwillingness</em> to see through it was mind altering. </p>
<p>I had always believed people were more resilient than this. But now I believe we've been lulled into complacency via our access to mindless technology, the never-ending propaganda of the media/social media glom as well as the garbage food we eat.</p>

        <p>I hear ya. I know some really intelligent people who eat up the fear porn that the media spoon feeds them. Healthy, young people triple-masking and getting the vaccine the second they could. </p>
<p>Think of how much data that has been accumulated over the years on how large populations of people react to certain events, patterns of human emotion, and the methods of manipulation that are gathered from that data. They know exactly what makes us tick, and use this knowledge to exploit our emotions to gain control over our personal choices. It’s scary.</p>

        <p>You're right. And that helps to explain why it seems to have been even more effective on young people. There's far more data on their reactions to social media stimulus. I wonder if they've been planning on this all along -- if this was even part of the reason for the existence and ubiquity of social media. Gathering data to eventually be used for totalitarian purpose.</p>

        <p>I’m not trained in the neurosciences, but my understanding of it as it relates to social media is that novelty of stimuli is the reason for its addictive nature. The human brain loves novelty, and the “newsfeed” function on a lot of sites serves as a never-ending stream of dopamine spikes. If you just scroll for hours, this fries your reward system and results in a very sluggish or unmotivated feeling, because you just gave yourself a hypernormal reward stimulus, and real-life rewards pale in comparison, so this naturally you are drawn to the former. </p>
<p>I think social media is a goldmine for this data gathering on our psychology, especially because it’s basically the new public forum, it’s where the most humans congregate and exchange ideas.</p>
<p>But I think social media was created and designed to make the mental health of the user suffer above all else. Dopamine/reward fatigue is a very powerful thing, if you’ve ever experienced it, you just feel like you want to nap and procrastinate on the important things you need to do, which is very useful if you want a complacent society that will never rock the boat.</p>

        <p>Yep this is exactly what's going on. <em>And</em> they've discovered that <em>negative</em> stimulus is the most provocative. So your news feed is purposely showing you stories that the algorithm has predicted will upset you the most. This is obviously having disastrous effects on people's mental health. </p>
<p>I mean, I see it every day among the most vulnerable. I'm an elementary school teacher and our kids all get their own chromebooks starting in 4th grade. Almost all of them have their own phones by then also. At age 9-10. Their attention spans are almost nonexistent. The whining is constant. Nothing is ever good enough because nothing in reality will ever compare to the stimulus their screens can provide. And worst of all -- they're becoming hypersexual at far earlier ages than are healthy. I have 4th graders talking to each other about porn.</p>

        <p>Yikes. I got my first cell phone when I was 15. It was a shitty pay-as-you-go phone that had no camera, apps, nothing. I was in middle school as smartphones came to popularity. Looking back, I’m grateful that I got the opportunity to develop mentally in the absence of smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>My friend is also an elementary teacher, and she’s always talking about her encounters with parents that act as though they are inconvenienced because they have a kid, and don’t demonstrate much care. These are the parents who don’t show up to conferences and don’t care enough to reward good behavior with positive reinforcement and enthusiasm, so these kids naturally develop a craving for attention and validation, and their ability to excel in school and behave in class suffers partly because of that. Is that something you see as well?</p>
<p>I only ask because these are the parents who use screen technology to do the parenting for them. They buy their 7 year-old an iPad because it keeps them occupied and distracted, and lessens the burden of having a child because they are able to distract their kid for hours at a time. But it’s concerning when you think about how this affects the development of the child.</p>

<p>......yes. But this tends to fall on fairly specific racial lines where I work and considering this is reddit, I'd rather not say more as it would be unpopular, even though I'm actively trying to help fix these situations in my position. But yes, I've seen it -- plenty.</p>

        <p>No it's not. His only claim to fame is being a conservative pundit, and there aren't a lot of black conservative pundits so that's his niche and is why he is recognized. His music is bad. I don't know why people say he's a rapper as if he's actually successful in that field. He's just some dude who happens to be on the same team as the no new normal people. Don't know why anyone cares what he thinks.</p>

none of them have lost their jobs or any income.  </p>

        <p>I lost a lot of respect for teachers during all this. I gained a lot of respect for grocery store workers though, they are understaffed, over worked, and under paid. They had to deal with the panic shopping and the fear first hand, they are more “ exposed” than anyone else, and I never heard them complain. Also for some people, they were the only human interaction for a year, they maybe unknowingly kept some very lonely people for losing it. Lots of respect to the grocery store workers</p>

        <p>And yet 99.997 people in Canada are demanding that 12-19 year olds get vaccinated for their safety and so the virus can’t mutate.  The TV really got to the parents that are signing up their kids for this - they actually think that is heroic.</p>

        <p>Ugh. So disgusting. My sister is very intelligent and went from a hardcore Trump hater to a full blown Branch Covidian. She's already said she's planning to get my <em>TWO YEAR OLD</em> niece vaccinated as soon as it becomes available. She won't let me stand within 6 feet of my niece bc <em>I'm</em> not vaccinated, yet she'll hop the line if necessary to jam some untested propaganda juice into her arm. </p>
<p>And llike others have said, I tried to have a conversation about the numbers Zuby is talking about here regarding child mortality. I did a ton of research. You can't even <em>find</em> death statistics for children on Covid because it's nonexistent. 0-19 is the youngest age range you'll find. There's nothing breaking it down to actual children or actual teens etc. I showed her and my parents everything I was able to find on the subject and they just went crazy, accused me of being willing to murder my niece via Covid contamination, and kicked me out of the house.</p>

        <p>Just googled it. 51 lightning deaths a year in the states vs 2163 aged 18-29 of covid.</p>
<p>Bare in mind the lightning deaths aren't filtered by age so on an even distribution I guess a third of those 51 were 25 or under. (17 people).</p>
<p>So 150 times more likely to die from covid.</p>
<p>But people who use death as the only metric are being a bit too simplistic imo.</p>
<p>A far greater number got fucked up pretty bad and really ill from it. Lightning strikes aren't contagious.</p>

        <p>Been telling people this for months now.  </p>
<p>Also, the deaths have an average of four serious comorbidities. In the 70+ range, this is of particular note, being that one of the main comorbidities is diabetes. People with diabetes tend to have a life-expectancy of ten fewer years than the average. In the US, that's actually around 79 years old. So minus ten or so and, voila.  </p>
<p>Imagine people dying within the average life expectancy range. Truly shocking stuff. Never heard of 80+ year olds with heart disease and cancer suddenly up and dying. Completely unprecedented.</p>

<p>They had one more column with population in the age group, but removed it a few months ago. Probably it’s not so scary when you see ~200 kids died out of 50 millions kids during 15 months of a global pandemic</p>

        <p>Does the CDC even still list the survival rate like this anywhere on their site? I remember they did last year and simple tables like this were easy to find but I couldn't find it again recently, just more complicated tables with more raw data. Seemed to me like they switched it to obscure the data legibility since it didn't fit with the narrative. Would love a link though if it's still there.</p>

<p>3-4 million people died of respiratory problems in 2017. I wonder will that be 6-8 million showing these are separate individuals that would have died from a respiratory illness from a bad strain of influenza.

        <p>From Table 2 in your link, the number of people who died and had both covid and pneumonia is 288073 compared to all deaths in the same setting at 375520, or 60.7%. The only interesting thing here is that the number is not 99.4% Either way you certainly don't want to get pneumonia while you have another serious disease like covid going on.</p>

        <p>That's not what the table means.  It has to do with what is listed on the death certificate.  The Covid AND pneumonia column is where both are listed as the main causes of death.  The other column is where the patient had pneumonia, but it wasn't necessarily listed as a cause of death.</p>
<p>Why did they do this?  Because pneumonia is deadly.  If the patient had it, then it is likely it contributed to the person's death.</p>
<p>This makes a lot more sense than including random pneumonia deaths in a table about Covid mortality.</p>

        <p>"Table 2 presents death counts involving COVID-19 <strong>and other select causes of death</strong> by time-period in which the death occurred, and the place of death." You have to read the description above the table before you claim that it only makes sense if you read it with your own interpretation. Since pneumonia clearly complicates covid cases and contributes to the death toll, they are comparing/contrasting with pneumonia cases alone, as well as a column for pneumonia plus flu.</p>

<p>Setting that aside for a moment, tell me what you think is the meaning of having one column labeled "pneumonia" and one labeled as "covid and pneumonia" and different numbers for each? Help me out here.</p>

        <p>All the deaths involve Covid.  The one that says Covid and pneumonia is where they both appear on the death certificate.  The other column are Covid patients with pneumonia, but it's not necessarily listed as cause of death.</p>
<p>Wait...I already said this, and you conveniently ignored it, just like you ignored the table title and the footnote.  Typical for a doomer, blatantly ignore the things that prove you wrong while parroting "Follow the science".</p>

        <p>Another thing I want to add here is that Covid is playing the same role as flu in these cases.  The pneumonia is the main cause of death just like it is in flu cases.  The difference is that flu isn't usually listed as a cause of death.  Basically, if you applied the Covid rules to flu, then in 2018 there would have been about 570k flu deaths.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you counted Covid deaths using the flu rules, then the number of deaths would be about 6% of the current number.</p>

        <p>You realize that flu and pneumonia are lumped together as a cause of death in the CDC statistics? And even when lumped together, they aren't even 1/10th of covid deaths. (In a typical year - there were more pneumonia deaths in 2020 because covid can cause pneumonia.)</p>

        <p>There is a combined ICD code, but that actually has to be put on the death certificate for it to count.  Most of the time it's not.  The CDC actually uses a mathematical model to determine flu death statistics because just going by death certificates would grossly undercount the number of flu deaths.</p>

        <p>So you acknowledge that the CDC accounts for underreporting of flu deaths. Yet the estimates of flu deaths are still in the range of 20-60k and not nearly 600k like COVID.</p>

        <p>No, I said that flu is underreported on death certificates.  Jist like Covid is overreported on death certificates.  It's being listed as cause of death without any clinical correlation and sometimes without even a psotive test.</p>
<p>If the used Covid rules for flu deaths.  Then, flu would kill as many peolple every year as they say Covid does.  Conversely, if Covid death reporting followed the same rules as every other disease, then Covid deaths would be in the 20-60k range.</p>
<p>Basically, a physican can put Covid as the cause of death for literally every patient and not get questioned.  Surely even you can see how this would inflate the numbers.</p>

        <p>You said flu is underreported on death certificates, and that's why the CDC adjusts the flu death estimates. That is correct; the CDC multiplies the number of reported flu deaths by 6 to get the estimated number. I don't know how much more you want the CDC to multiply the number by.</p>
<p>Multiple surveys have found that 20-28% of Americans report losing a close loved one to COVID. I can't imagine a survey coming anywhere close to those numbers for losing a loved one to the flu when it comes to a person's entire lifetime, let alone 1 year.</p>

<p>So, those people made the diagnosis themselves?  No, a doctor told them.  The same doctors that we've already established underreport flu and overreport Covid.  Anyone who's familiar with statistics know that basing decisions solely on surveys is inaccurate.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for someone to give me an example of a deadly respiratory infectious disease whose diagnosis is made solely on a lab test with NO clinical correlation.  I can't find one no matter how hard I look.</p>

        <p>No, it's not easy to differentiate based on clinical presentation.  Someone with flu which progresses to   secondary pneumonia has the exact same presentation as a Covid case that has progressed to secondary pneumoinia.  The only difference is a lab test.  Honestly, you should doubt any personal testimony you can't substantiate with objective evidence.</p>

        <p>You're not describing Covid.  The cases where it goes from mild to severe is due to an autoimmune reaction, either MIS-C or this:</p>

        <p>That’s not what you did. You asked if we should apply the average incidence rate of a population to one subset of that group. That would be like applying my 99.35% survival rate to the age 70+ cohort, and that would be an abuse of statistics. </p>
<p>What I did was different. I merely took the survival rates of all cohorts and weighed them to get an average survival rate of the total population.</p>

        <p>The mandates are what it was for me. I have taken vaccines all my life since birth before I was able to question anything.</p>
<p>This is the only virus to have a vaccine made in about a year tho and the only one where they are giving donuts, burgers, lotteries to take. I totally get peoples suspiciousness towards it.</p>
<p>I went to be able to travel when this done and they are already talking about a vaccine passport. </p>
<p>TBH, I have already taken a number of vaccines in my life and if this kills me, sad to say but I don't really care. If I have to live like we have been forced to in lockdown I would honestly rather be dead.</p>
<p>It's getting better here now though, i go to TO island and it actually feels normal there. No masks, no covid worries or talk. Feels like normal life in the sun again. </p>
<p>It's actually good in a way because all the people who crowded it and were dragged there by family and friends have an excuse not to go.</p>

        <p>The middle column and right column should add up to %100. The middle column is using the decimal form of a percentage, but still has the percent sign. This makes the middle number wrong by a factor of 100.</p>

        <p>You're right.  The first column is not a percentage, meaning this is very misleading.  The numbers should be multiplied by 100.  This should be taken down.</p>

        <p>So, if we simply use the quoted numbers, we know that 94.6% of adults over 70 survive CV-19, while 0.054% sadly do not. </p>
<p>What therefore becomes of other 5.34% of people? Are they stuck in some kind of perpetual halfway state? Does the wearing of masks make the determination of life and death so difficult that we just don’t know? What are we doing to help these people? I think we need to demand action for these people, the forgotten ones!</p>

        <p>Those numbers make no sense.</p>
<p>Survival rate of 94.6% means the infection/fatality figure should be 5.4%, not 0.054%.</p>
<p>The survival rates are correct, but the numbers look screwed about with, unless the case/fatalities never had % but were normalised to 1, in which case 0.054 is 5.4% as 1 being 100%.</p>
<p>The units seem off.</p>

        <p>Isn't it not about the deaths though? If we had a 100% death rate, the virus would die out. If its really low like this, it becomes a problem when you can't take care of the all the infected, combined with already existing factors that makes it actually deadly.</p>
<p>The worst scenario would be a really infectious virus(like this one) but death rates that let the victims live for a while or somehow spread even after the host dies.</p>

        <p>0.01 multiplied by 7 000 000 000 = 70 000 000. That's why a 99.9% survival rate is a problem. How fucking hard is it for you morons to do math. Nevermind the fact that this statistic is only for children and young adults.</p>

        <p>Math isn’t your strong suit obviously. Neither is reading comprehension. These are survival rates, not the inverse of the mortality rate. Do not only is your math off by a few orders of magnitude, but you need to calculate based on number of cases, not total population. When you do that the number of deaths for ages 0-19 drops from your 240,000 to just 240. Oops.</p>
<p>EDIT: by the way, that’s less than half the number of people the same age that die of the flu every single year.</p>

        <p>One minor thing I want to say, survival does not mean zero underlying or post conditions. </p>
<p>I felt deathly sick three times, survived, and was left with a heart rushing problem that didn’t go away until after the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Well. I was left with an irregular heartbeat.</p>
<p>I didn’t change anything for COVID. I always spent more time in my house than outside. The health guidance Trump gave was go outside to the national parks. Not sure why I didn’t visit nature like that. </p>
<p>And it is not bullshit, I took J and J and it made me remember all of my life’s injuries as phantom pain, even ones I wasn’t aware of. I’m talking scars I have but wasn’t thinking about or remembering about suddenly flaring up. And my heart rushing sensation went away. I have felt it mildly in the last week (after a half year of it going away) but nothing painful, honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if I have the sniffles, my head was achy, but don’t really feel them. </p>
<p>COVIDhit me hard, like shaking in my blanket to death hard. </p>
<p>There were mice experiments with COVID, all I remember thinking was COVID melts the brain and it is meant for ethnic cleansing.</p>

        <p>It's tricky because long covid is fucking real. But at the same time, there's no treatment for it neither interest in helping us anytime soon (aka I have long covid, improving with a bunch of supplements/time/luck).</p>
<p>I wouldn't say that lockdowns and fascism are the answer to control this virus. I don't even think that we can really "control it".</p>
<p>But it just would be cool to help the small % of folks that are struggling with post viral covid issues.</p>
<p>At the moment, they only offered me the vaccine. After a whole year feeling like shit. Billions towards jabs. Zero interest towards the actual people that got ill with it.</p>

        <p>It’s very bad to a very small percentage, and only about 8% of COVID deaths were single cause (from the CDC website). We should’ve only locked down higher-risk individuals, and anyone who was too afraid to face it. I think it would’ve passed quicker, and we wouldn’t be facing so many variants.

        <p>I’m immunocompromised because I’m diabetic lol. They’re one and the same. I should actually say immunesuppressed because I can still get vaccines. Either way, it’s the same thing. Diabetics are immunesuppressed, and diabetics need insulin. Do you know how any of this works? It’s genetic. If you wanna follow your delusions that vaccines caused this then go for it, you’ll just be wrong</p>

        <p>No this one :)</p>
<p>“https://www.lung.org/blog/covid-masks “Do Masks Cause Low Oxygen Levels?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. We wear masks all day long in the hospital. The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur. There is some evidence, however, that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body. People with preexisting lung problems should discuss mask wearing concerns with their health care providers.

        <p>So you’re saying nobody has died from this? Is that what you’re saying right now? Because if so that tells me everything I need to know. I know people personally who were very young and healthy who died from respiratory failure on a ventilator from this disease. You’re just wrong, plain and simple. %0.01 is not zero. Even if that small amount of people died from this, people still died and I’m doing my part to prevent that</p>

“Do Masks Cause Low Oxygen Levels?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. We wear masks all day long in the hospital. The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur. There is some evidence, however, that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body. People with preexisting lung problems should discuss mask wearing concerns with their health care providers. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system. “</p>

        <p>It’s not all done by the cdc. You know that, right? Private companies and reliable scientists have studied this apart from the cdc. The science is there whether you believe it or not🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

        <p>Well when I visit my local general practitioner and I know more than them about general nutrition and health advice it would seem that not every scientists and doctor is competent enough or looks outside the bigger picture to even get the real science.Anyways I hope you find the truth</p>

        <p>So that’s the only defense you have? To claim I’m making up my losses? You’re really running out of defenses lol. Read the facts and weep I guess. I don’t know what else to tell you. I guess I’m also making up the kid that died in one of the schools I sub at, or the 3 former coworkers I lost (1 of which had cancer so it was obviously going to hit them harder but the others were very healthy and in their 30’s)</p>

        <p>I’m confused what you’re trying to say honestly. I know the ones I’ve lost, you don’t know the ones I did lose. The only defense you had was to say I didn’t actually lose anybody when you have no way of knowing that</p>

        <p>There’s no paper trail that I’m going to give you. You think you’ve caught me in some lie but I’m not just gonna put out private info about loved ones who aren’t around anymore. It’s not respectful and I couldn’t care less about what you think, although I’ll still stay vaccinated and wear a mask to protect you. Bye now. I’ll let you have your last word and I’m not responding anymore. I’m at work, have a good one</p>

        <p>Both. This account is strictly for coming to antagonize y’all. I should say I actually wasn’t here for debate because I knew y’all would offer no kind of actual evidence and have nothing to bring to the table so I guess I can’t call it real debate. Maybe if you offer some actual evidence that a. Masks and vaccines don’t work and b. That I didn’t lose people, then there’s no debate to be had. It’s so funny, you keep digging yourself in a deeper hole because you can’t offer any evidence, you just keep saying “didn’t happen” “offer proof” over and over</p>
<p>You can’t say it didn’t happen and change the past. Say it all you want though, still happened🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

<p>Sadly isn't well understood at all. We just know it happens but there's no treatment at all. Keep in mind that the doctors telling you that "post viral illnesses are normal" are the same ones telling you to have the jab. It's the Science TM team that has been doing nothing useful for medical science in the last 50 years or so. </p>
<p>Source: I've had Covid, then long covid &amp; now I'm feeling better. No, I didn't have the jab, not gonna have it anytime soon.</p>

        <p>Exactly. </p>
<p>And that is why you are a selfish asshole if you leave your house for any reason. Even if you are vaccinated and wearing a mask, you can still transmit COVID to the elderly, sick, and immunocompromised who potentially cannot be vaccinated. Is it really worth it to risk killing someone or forcing them to live with long term symptoms just so you can go to the grocery store? There are perfectly good delivery services. </p>
<p>Please make sure you are being considerate to others and stay home, do not visit family, do not go to the store unless absolutely necessary.</p>

        <p>Excellent point my friend. </p>
<p>And that is why you are a selfish asshole if you leave your house for any reason. Even if you are vaccinated and wearing a mask, you can still transmit COVID to the elderly, sick, and immunocompromised who potentially cannot be vaccinated. Is it really worth it to risk killing someone or forcing them to live with long term symptoms just so you can go to the grocery store? There are perfectly good delivery services. </p>
<p>Please make sure you are being considerate to others and stay home, do not visit family, do not go to the store unless absolutely necessary. Oh and even if your friends are vaccinated and wearing a mask, you can still transmit COVID to them, and they can further spread it to others who may be immunocompromised and unable to get vaccinated, so please don't hangout with friends.</p>

        <p>I doubt they would say that.</p>
<p>"Hey son, I have a 5% risk of dying if I get covid but it's worth it if it means you dont have to wear a mask for 20 minutes when you walk in the store." And even if their life is so bad that they think that my elder family like their lives so wear your fucking mask, mash your hands, get the vaccine, and please let us go back to normal as quick as possible.</p>

        <p>I was talking about society shutting down man. If you wanna wear your mask and get vaccinated do that all you want. My elderly would prefer the society to not be shut down. And I know my family thank you very much for correcting me on what they think though.</p>

        <p>My 70+ year old family members are all vaccinated, so I'm set. They're high risk due to their age so it makes sense for them!</p>
