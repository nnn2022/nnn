    <strong>"People will help bury a body before they admit there was a murder" An essay on why people can't admit they made a mistake</strong>
    <p><p>The vaccine has firmly place a wedge in society. Those who got the vaxx and those who don't want it for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>There is a substantial group in the middle that for the vaccine but are having a hard time coming to grasp with the idea that it wasn't what was promised.</p>
<p>It didn't prevent exposure.</p>
<p>It didn't prevent transmission.</p>
<p>It didn't bring back normal life.</p>
<p>It didn't do away with dictator governments.</p>
<p>And they are scared.  They are struggling with the idea that they made a mistake but <strong>cannot admit that</strong> why? Because they'll realize that they're actively harming those around them, something they professed against for a year "stay home for grandma"</p>
<p>Now they are scared because they don't know what's in their body, they don't know what it'll do to them, and they're afraid to be associated with liars and manipulators.</p>
<p>So their gut react is to double down.</p>
<p>They will bury their loved ones who eventually died of covid, without taking in account that the vaccine did nothing to help.</p>
<p>People have a really hard time admitting they were fooled. Like bury the bodies of their loved ones without ever admitting they contributed to a dark and cruel world.</p>
<p>So what can you do about it?  Continue to be normal, live your life outside the scary covid world. Protest against government, speak up and continue to speak truth into the world.</p>
<p>Remember,</p>
<p>Only lies worry about what is being said around it.  The truth has no fear in the world.</p></p>
