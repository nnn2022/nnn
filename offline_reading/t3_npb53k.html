    <strong>"Empathy" and the Narcissistic COVID Cultist</strong>
    <p><p>TLDR - The "empathy" argument constantly thrown around by COVID cultists is a load of crap. In actuality, they are not truly "empathetic" in the slightest.</p>
<p>They are raging narcissists who identify with weakness and despise self-sufficiency and autonomy primarily as a result of having abandoned traditional religion/objective morality and having replaced it with "media morality."</p>
<p>Why do the COVID cultists have complete ownership of "empathy"? </p>
<p>Is adherence to COVID measures truly about empathy if one's empathy is derived from a desire to feel superior to others? </p>
<p>Or is it truly about narcissism and the desire to signal that one is a part of the in-group with the most media and public support? </p>
<p>I hear all these folks that support COVID measures gloat about how empathetic they are for wearing masks, wasting years of their life in pointless lockdown, or getting a vaccine they statistically don't need, as they are protecting others. </p>
<p>If they were truly empathetic, they would not need to go around proclaiming their moral superiority. They would do their acts of charity, and not boast about how righteous they are. </p>
<p>The base state of man is an empathetic one. We are social creatures by nature. Helping others is not exceptional and worthy of praise; it is the norm.</p>
<p>As an anecdote, I have been involved in several manners of unpaid, completely voluntary charity since my childhood. </p>
<p>The people I have worked with helped others, and that was sufficient for them. They do not go around bragging about how good they are, or how they should be praised. </p>
<p>We see the opposite amongst those who brag about their "empathy" that they derive from ceding bodily autonomy and natural rights to corrupt authorities. </p>
<p>Reminiscent of Matthew 6:2, when they believe that they are helping the needy, "they announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others." </p>
<p>Their empathy is not truly empathetic. It is self-serving narcissism where they attempt to ingratiate themselves with the other members of their in-group. Do not be fooled by their moralistic haranguing. </p>
<p>If they were truly empathetic, they would also take into consideration the suffering of youths who are losing the best years of their lives. </p>
<p>If they were truly empathetic, they would listen to the pleas of small business owners that were forced to shut down while big business remained open, and as a result lost everything they spent their whole life working to build. </p>
<p>If they were truly empathetic, they would care about individuals who have deeply-held convictions against certain pandemic measures, and would not coerce them into obedience. </p>
<p>This is not empathy. It is about something else entirely. </p>
<p>Acting against your best interests, blindly adhering to COVID measures, and seeking public validation for your subservience is much more about ritual self-flagellation than true empathy. </p>
<p>Similar to how some religious believers will publicly strike themselves to show physical penance for sin, it would appear that the COVID cult engages in public self-punishment in order to demonstrate how righteous they are. </p>
<p>Their sin? Being privileged with an able body that doesn't require medical intervention to function or stay alive. </p>
<p>They view themselves as privileged for that, and in our new liberal "religion of privilege" that has pervaded every aspect of culture and academia, that means that they are morally inferior. </p>
<p>As a result, they must absolve themselves of the guilt that comes from having committed that "sin" against liberal ideology. </p>
<p>They have replaced God, objective morality, and true religion with subjective and arbitrary morality. Those things were "problematic," and had to go. They chose to embrace sin and worldliness instead of truth. </p>
<p>We all must have some form of religion, although it does not have to involve a God. Certain aspects of religion such as ritual, community, moral guidance, and purpose are essential to everyone. </p>
<p>If we turn our backs on traditional religion, we will inevitably make new ones, even if they must be secular in nature. </p>
<p>In comes the liberal "religion of privilege." It fills the hole that was left behind after the long-term decay of Christianity in the West. </p>
<p>It provides the above components of religion that many people lost after becoming disillusioned with (and leaving) the often disgustingly corrupt and sinful version of Christianity being practiced in the western world. </p>
<p>These individuals cannot mentally divorce true religion from the corrupt institution of the Church. As a result, they are unable to consider that objective morality might be possible, as it is too intimately connected to the Church in their mind, and therefore must be wrong as well.</p>
<p>Going down the list, with some COVID examples: adherence to pandemic measures is ritual. Donning the mask is akin to putting on a cross necklace to signify in-group membership. It shows that one is part of a community, and reaffirms one's status. </p>
<p>Getting vaccinated is ritual as well. It is their baptism. It is true initiation into their in-group, and as such, must be undergone by all who wish to be a part of their community. It must also be witnessed by all. </p>
<p>This is why you see so many COVID cultists treating their vaccination like a religious-level event. You see their descriptions of getting the shot, and they describe being overwhelmed by euphoric emotion, feeling liberated, and feeling whole. </p>
<p>These descriptions are strikingly similar to the ones expressed by individuals who have been baptized as adults. </p>
<p>They become overwhelmed with feelings of joy, they feel that they have cast off the sin of their past life and started anew, and they feel an intense connection to the community that they are now a part of. </p>
<p>They then must proclaim to all the world that they have been vaccinated. They post pictures of their vaccination all over social media, showing off to all that they are now a righteous member of the in-group. </p>
<p>Many of these cultists have found purpose in their life through complying with COVID measures. </p>
<p>They lead meaningless, unexceptional lives that contribute little of value to society. They work mundane jobs to pay the bills, and perhaps purchase the occasional Funko Pop or Baby Yoda toy. </p>
<p>They never ended up being the stud athlete beloved by millions of adoring fans, they never became the president leading the country through hardship, and they never ended up doing anything important with their lives. </p>
<p>As a COVID cultist, that changes. They now have purpose - they have become a crusader against the evil of the disease. Every day, they put on their mask and feel that they are making a difference. </p>
<p>They feel that each and every individual has the capability to directly change the course of the pandemic. </p>
<p>This gives them a massive ego boost, and it is not unheard of to see them state that they are part of a war effort against COVID. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, they occasionally relate their adherence to pandemic measures to the sacrifice made by the men that stormed the beaches of Normandy to fight fascism. </p>
<p>This is all a load of crap. They are the opposite of brave, and they are not sacrificing anything except their autonomy (which they never valued to begin with.) Truly, they live in fear and demand that others sacrifice on their behalf. </p>
<p>The next aspect is community. As opposed to membership in a church, they now have membership in the Cult of COVID. </p>
<p>They find support from others both online and in-person. They receive a sense of belonging from being a part of this in-group, and they find solace amongst like-minded individuals. </p>
<p>Rather than join a church or a volunteer organization to materially help others, the COVID cultist opts to instead only perform actions that require them to do nothing of substance. </p>
<p>Stay at home, put on a mask, get a vaccine, order delivery, harass skeptics online, etc. This is "saving lives" to them. They are misled. </p>
<p>This is not "saving lives," it is blindly trusting unworthy authority and shifting the burden of disease off of the cultist and onto the "essential worker" who has no choice but to expose themselves to danger so that the cultist can maintain a clean conscience without personally sacrificing anything. </p>
<p>Moral guidance is the next major aspect of the Cult of COVID. These cultists live in a world without objective morality, as they have given up God. They need a value system to guide them, and the media has stepped in to fill that hole. </p>
<p>The media's code of ethics states that weakness and subservience to authority are the only moral actions. </p>
<p>It ascribes to a view that hierarchy is righteous, but must be based on submission to the elites and their narratives instead of ability. </p>
<p>In some ways, it is the opposite of traditional hierarchies - traditionally, the strongest and most capable are the righteous and they rule the weak. </p>
<p>In the new hierarchy, the weakest are the righteous, and the weaker and more oppressed one is, the higher position in the hierarchy they shall occupy. </p>
<p>We see this with the "Oppression Olympics" that pervades liberal spaces online and in academia. The more oppressed one is, the more influence and respect they command, and the more their opinion matters. </p>
<p>The weaker one is, the more dependent they are on authority to provide for them. That is why this hierarchy is being promoted so heavily by the powers that be. </p>
<p>This new religion encourages hatred of those who do not agree with the narrative. It then weaponizes psychology and uses terms such as "gaslighting," "narcissism," and "projection" indiscriminately to shut down dissent and frame protestors as abusive, evil manipulators who must be stopped. </p>
<p>It labels all of this "compassion" and "empathy." Those terms no longer mean that one is morally righteous and selfless. They now mean that one is an insecure, self-serving narcissist who denies true morality and shall forever be obedient to the powers that wish to control us all. </p>
<p>When one ascribes to objective morality, compassion and empathy mean that one has a responsibility to give of themselves willingly and freely to help. </p>
<p>There is no coercion or forcing sacrifice. They do not need to be bullied or shamed into helping others; they will naturally tend to do so. </p>
<p>What we see from the faux-empathetic cultists is the opposite. They do not get vaccinated, wear a mask, or waste their life away in lockdown out of true love for their fellow man. </p>
<p>They do those things for three reasons - first, because they were told to by their false prophets in the media, whom they can never question. </p>
<p>Second, those actions signify membership in an in-group. They need to constantly be reminded that they are "doing the right thing," they need to see that others are not, and they derive a sense of superiority from this. </p>
<p>Finally, following the last point, they derive a sense of pleasure from feeling superior, and naturally wish to punish "evil heretics" as well. </p>
<p>What does the cultist want to do, and why? </p>
<p>If you get to talking with them, they will often say that masks/vaccines/lockdowns should be mandated, and that nobody should be able to opt out (this is all out of empathy and compassion, of course. We narcissists just couldn't understand.) </p>
<p>What does that truly mean, though? Ask them who will make sure that such a mandate will be followed, and how. If it is to have any teeth, it must be enforced by violence and segregation. </p>
<p>A large number of Americans will never adhere to those measures unless physically forced to do so, and a not-insignificant number would fight to the death to maintain their freedom. </p>
<p>Do these COVID cultists wish to see that happen? Quite frankly, I believe the answer is yes. These cultists often have a violence fetish, if you read their comment and post histories. </p>
<p>They wish to see "the sinners" be punished for their heresy and sin, and they would take great joy in seeing retribution enacted against those who they believe to be evil. </p>
<p>The primary issue with that scenario is that they are weak people, who wish to act out a power fantasy. </p>
<p>They are the types that got their asses beat every day on the playground when they were children, got the girl taken from them in high school by the bully, and generally have no desire or ability to ever stand up for themselves. </p>
<p>They have blindly followed rules their whole lives. They were never the "rough-and-tumble" kids who took on their bullies and made their own way in the world. </p>
<p>They cowered behind the authority of the day - be it mom, the teacher, etc., and did everything the authority said in order to get in their good graces and hopefully receive protection from the kid who didn't want to play fair. </p>
<p>They weren't going to duke it out every day until the bully moved on to a weaker target who wouldn't put up a fight. No, they hoped that mommy would talk with the other kid's parents and get him in trouble, and then there would be no more bullying. </p>
<p>However, they are adults now. Mommy can't help them anymore, but the government can. This is why they place so much faith in these highly-corrupt institutions - they are acting in loco parentis for these emotionally-stunted manchildren. </p>
<p>They require a powerful parental figure to protect and provide for them, even if it is a horribly unethical one. </p>
<p>The state (and business that conspires with it) is their mommy that will make everything alright, and keep them safe from the big bad of the day. </p>
<p>They always identify with the weak and oppressed, and this is important to note. Even if they have achieved a modicum of conventional success as adults, they will never lose the "victim" and "persecuted" mindset. </p>
<p>Similar to what Kaczynski famously said about leftists having a desire to identify with "the weak, defeated, repellant, or otherwise inferior," the cultist must identify himself with the weakest of our society, even if he personally has no risk from COVID. </p>
<p>Furthermore, as Kaczynski stated, the leftist (or cultist, in this case) has an "intense loathing for anyone perceived to be strong and successful." Given that, he is incapable of classifying himself accurately as someone who is not in danger from the disease, as that would mean he is not morally righteous. </p>
<p>No, he now must believe that he is at the same level of risk as 80 year old fat grandma with eight chronic conditions. Deep down, he knows this to be false, however. </p>
<p>He will remain in a state of cognitive dissonance - either he is weak and morally righteous, or strong and evil, and therefore must atone for his sins. He cannot be both. </p>
<p>He can, however, change his identity based on the argument he is involved in should he desire to persuade others to agree with him. </p>
<p>At times, he will decry how COVID heretics are putting him at great risk every time he leaves the house. In this situation, he returns to his base state of weakness and lack of agency. He will say something along the lines of "healthy young people die of COVID too. Nobody is safe." </p>
<p>On other occasions, though, he will claim that he knows that he is not at personal risk, but acts out of "compassion" or "empathy." </p>
<p>"I got vaccinated and wear a mask to save grandma. There's no risk for me, I am just so empathetic," he will say. </p>
<p>In this situation, he is donning the mask of the strong yet humble individual who sacrifices of himself to help those less fortunate, as is required to remain virtuous in his mind. </p>
<p>The cultist must always be morally superior. Never forget this. They will change their identity based on who they are talking with, and will see nothing wrong with it. </p>
<p>Their aversion to perceived self-sufficiency and over-emphasis on sacrifice by the capable is why we see what we see from them. </p>
<p>To the cultist, weakness is a sign of morality. The weaker, less capable, and more oppressed one is, the more moral they are. To be strong and capable is to be oppressive, and therefore evil. </p>
<p>This is also why BLM and liberal-identity protests have been ignored as a source of COVID spread, and why primarily conservative-aligned events have been demonized as "superspreaders," despite having no significant increase in death rates afterwards. </p>
<p>They view the BLM movement as defense of the weak - and they believe that support of the weak is morally virtuous, above all else. Therefore, any resulting protests cannot be bad, and cannot spread disease. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the cultist could never be morally wrong, and therefore cannot spread COVID at an event, as that would be harming the weak, which they would never do. That is something only evil people do, and they are not evil. </p>
<p>They see large events perceived to be connected to conservatives as existential threats. </p>
<p>They believe that a full-capacity Texas Rangers game, packed streets celebrating an Alabama Crimson Tide football national championship win, or anti-COVID measure protests are all going to result in overwhelmed hospitals and bodies in the streets. </p>
<p>In all of those instances, that never happened according to later data, despite the media narrative promising mass casualties. </p>
<p>Large events connected to liberal causes, such as 10,000+ person BLM/social justice protests or people celebrating Biden's win in the streets of New York and California are not treated with the same concern. </p>
<p>Those are different, you see - and even if they do spread COVID, it was worth it for a good cause. The irony is lost on them. </p>
<p>This is where their faux morality starts to fall apart. They have no morals, only a false sense of self-righteousness. They stand for nothing except subservience to the powerful. </p>
<p>This is why they praise weakness - the powers that be have made weakness morally righteous, as it leads to a society that praises the least capable and most dependent, who will then require someone in power to provide for them. </p>
<p>As they are weak individuals with no belief in objective morality, they are lured in by this man-made value system that promises them that they do not need to take agency over their own life and better themselves, as weakness is the only ethical position. </p>
<p>What ends up happening? What will they do? </p>
<p>Now, they hear that these evil COVID heretics are killing the infirm, the disabled, and the incapable by not adhering to the mandates that the powerful have foisted upon them. </p>
<p>When they hear this, they are personally attacked. They identify with these groups, even if they are not included in them. </p>
<p>Something must be done about this - they won't be the one doing it personally, but something must be done to stymie the heretics. </p>
<p>They will never personally attempt to forcefully "convert" a COVID "heretic." You won't see them signing up to go door-to-door and forcefully vaccinate deep in the heart of heavily-armed Trump Country, and you won't see them signing up to take the heat that comes from enforcing segregation. </p>
<p>However, they will gleefully outsource that responsibility to jackbooted thugs who will be happy to do so with extreme prejudice. </p>
<p>They will cheer on from a distance as they once again get to feel morally superior while personally having to do nothing of substance. </p>
<p>This is by far the biggest threat posed by the COVID cultist. They will come out in droves and support measures that increase the power of large corporations/police/military to enforce adherence to their beliefs. </p>
<p>They will vote for whoever tells them that they will be morally superior by putting in zero effort besides being subservient, and they will vote for whoever promises to crack down on the heretics that are now responsible for all the evil in the world. </p>
<p>Where does this lead us? What should we do? </p>
<p>It should be noted as well that these cultists have an extreme fear of death. Given that almost none have faith in God or an afterlife, they believe death is absolutely the worst thing that could happen to a person. </p>
<p>If it is true that when you die, it is all over, in a "lights out forever" scenario, then of course, one would want to do anything they could to preserve life, even if that life is not a quality one. </p>
<p>This, combined with constant media fearmongering about death, is why they are so insanely afraid of COVID (and also why so many liberals live in fear of mass shootings, despite them being statistically insignificant.) </p>
<p>They would sacrifice all of their freedoms in order to live just a little bit longer. They would rather live as a slave and have no autonomy than die as a free man, because to them, death is worse than slavery. </p>
<p>At least as a slave, you tend to be kept alive as long as possible so that your master can siphon off every last bit of value that you possess. </p>
<p>There is no changing the mind of an individual like this, unless you can change their views on death and objective morality. There is not a minor political disagreement between them and us; there is an entirely different worldview. </p>
<p>They live in a state of constant and irrational fear. For the most part, though, it is not their fault. </p>
<p>They were never forced by their parents, teachers, or society to become self-sufficient and fight their own battles. They were lied to and told that someone else will always provide for them should they be unable to do so themselves.</p>
<p>Then, they became disillusioned with the religious institutions that reneged on their most sacred responsibilities to foster belief in objective morality and faith in God. </p>
<p>These institutions chose to embrace greed and worldliness, and many people rightfully became disgusted by them and left religion altogether. </p>
<p>As a result, these people became easy prey for evil conmen who knew exactly how to take advantage of their newfound existential insecurities. </p>
<p>They have been manipulated by expert propagandists who know exactly how to turn off rational thinking and turn on hysteria. </p>
<p>This could happen to any of us. If we expose ourselves to fear for long enough, and turn away from the truth of God, we will become no different than these cultists that we currently find ourselves at odds with. </p>
<p>These cultists are not inherently weak - they have been socialized to be that way, or at the very least identify as such. There is a concerted effort to ensure that everyone is weak and dependent on the powers that be, and that everyone is living in a constant state of fear. </p>
<p>We must remain vigilant, keep our faiths, and remember to never buy into fearmongering. </p>
<p>For example - many of us now are as afraid of vaccine shedding and spike proteins as the cultists are of COVID. </p>
<p>Whether or not that phenomenon is real, being afraid will do nothing. Given that a substantial portion of the population is vaccinated, unless you wish to forever remain at home like a cultist, you will come into contact with individuals who might shed. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, caution is always necessary. But we cannot live our lives in fear over something that may or may not turn out to matter. We didn't do it for COVID, and this should be no different. </p>
<p>So how do we deal with these individuals, many of whom are our loved ones? </p>
<p>We must lead by example, and show them what it is like to live a life free from fear and dependency. </p>
<p>Some of them will never come back around to the truth, and that is an unfortunate reality. We must accept that. </p>
<p>However, those that can be brought back to their senses will not respond well to ad hominem attacks or arguments that their brains cannot currently handle. </p>
<p>Calling them "sheep" will only entrench their beliefs and further the divide, and mentioning nebulous concepts of freedom and autonomy will not work when they have been taught that those things are worthless and often harmful.</p>
<p>They must see you living your life full of happiness, free from negative emotions. You must show that what you are doing is inherently right. </p>
<p>When talking with them, you must treat them with compassion. You must show the facts, not your opinion. If we are right, the evidence speaks for itself. And it does - the tyrannical pandemic measures have done little to curb the disease. </p>
<p>It may take a while, but if you can plant a seed of doubt about the media narrative in a loved one's mind, you have a chance to wake them from their nightmare. </p>
<p>Once that seed has been planted, they will be able to see behind the veil of lies that has blinded so many of our fellow citizens over the past year and a half. </p>
<p>Try to show anyone who is receptive to the truth what is really happening right now. Those who are set in their ways must be left to suffer in their own arrogance. </p>
<p>Their sin will punish itself; what they are doing is inherently wrong, and they will reap the suffering that they sow as they waste their lives in fear. </p>
<p>As for what we must do - we must continue to fight against fear and complacency. Never believe that the powers that be are done. </p>
<p>Lockdowns and mandates may be lifting for now, but this will not last. It is not conspiracy we fight against, but the natural evolution of power. It will always seek to concentrate in the hands of the few, and those few are always looking for a way to wield it. </p>
<p>None of this is over. Keep protesting the "New Normal" in all of it's forms. Fight against pointless measures that do nothing to protect the populace, but greatly concentrate power in the hands of the corrupt. </p>
<p>After COVID-19 it will be climate change, it will be another disease, it will be solar flares, it will be social justice, it will be overpopulation, it will be a Bill Gates-sponsored famine, or any number of other things. </p>
<p>Whatever the cause célèbre of the day is, you can be assured that the corrupt bastards in power will not stop until they have complete dominion over this Earth and all of it's inhabitants.</p></p>

        <p>I'm an ex-Christian fundamentalist, there wasn't much empathy in the Christian world either especially if you didn't fit the white picket fence monied lifestyle: I am glad you admit the corruption of that world.</p>
<p>I think you are right, people have found a "new secular" religion and the priests/ministers are the corporate scientists and doctors. They already got the martyrs lined up "sacrificing" their health for the cause. Right wing Christianity went Dominionist and authoritarian in America but the Covid disciples are no different either, they are just as fully authoritarian. The vaxx is indeed a ritual to them. I wear the masks myself due to higher risk but see the masks as ritualized as well. The powers that be want full control and they know trauma programming works. That's basically what has been done to this world. I believe the vaxx and this whole process is evil, and don't want to be a part of it. Even what they are doing to kids is disgusting beyond measure. I am trying to figure out how to have a life outside of their scope, everyone around here belongs to the Covid religion, it gets lonely.</p>

        <p>I believe that there are similar issues with the conservative/Christian side of the country as well. They tend to believe that anyone who does not fit their arbitrary descriptions of "successful" or "strong" is not worthy of respect or a place in society. </p>
<p>I decided against including those issues because those folks are not the primary drivers of the "New Normal" at the moment, and I had already damn near written a novel as it was. </p>
<p>Nobody was gonna want to read part 2 as well, especially when it's not relevant to the topic of the sub.</p>
<p>But yes - the current state of Christianity in this country is appalling. Judgmental evangelicalism is a major threat to our rights and autonomy, and the Christianity we have today is for the most part nowhere close to the truth. It is idolatry and has nothing to do with what is objectively right.</p>
<p>The fact that "prosperity gospel" exists and enjoys mainstream success speaks volumes as to the state of Christianity in this culture. Those responsible for teaching objective morality failed completely.</p>
<p>I cannot at all blame others for rejecting this perversion of the truth. They rightfully have decided to not be a part of the corruption of God's law. Unfortunately, there is not a mainstream alternative that remains true to what is right. </p>
<p>This new "media religion" is the replacement, and damn, is that scary. </p>
<p>Ultimately, objective morality exists whether or not people agree with it. Those that sin will reap what they sow; they do not require man to punish them for it. Those that are wise will take note, and those who aren't will not.</p>
<p>And I feel for you. I am blessed enough to be living in a place that is now 100% back to normal, and where most of the people were never in favor of pandemic measures. I cannot imagine how lonely it must be to have to swim upstream and fight alone against the current of evil that is working against us all.</p>

        <p>Thank you for admitting the corruption in the conservative and Christian world. Unless one is successful or strong or has a family they are not wanted in those circles. I was in an IFB church when I was still fundamentalist that didn't even have one young single or other person who lived in an apartment, it was all better off home owners who were older with stable economic lives and who judged accordingly.</p>
<p>I see them as easily led as the liberals, Dominionism, spreading the virus [the part that was real beyond the cooked up PCR tests] across the whole country into the most remote rural enclaves. The economic selfishness of telling the young[gen X and below], disabled and poor to just go starve in the gutter and helping of the elite to make economic lives meaner, is just as much as a betrayal of the left.
The current state of Christianity is rotten. BTW most of the Christians here support the new normal. [Lutherans, mainstream evangelical and lined up for the vaxx] but I know there will be regional differences here. </p>
<p>I left Christianity because it became oppressive. Imagine being poor and being told everyday it's your fault and you did not deserve God's blessings and years of unanswered prayers too. I couldn't do it anymore. I do see all of religion as a control matrix. I am in a liberal church but at least there I won't be judged for being disabled and there's some idea of treating the poor with some dignity.</p>
<p>I agree that the Christianity of today is corrupt. Jesus never wanted a Christian empire, and it's about domination, power and control. When I was a fundamentalist with the bible prophecy/conspiracy blog I used to post against Dominionism and the prosperity gospel.</p>
<p>I used to believe as a fundamentalist all the churches were "fallen away". My beliefs are different now but really for the more average person whose not rich or one of the "pillars" of society with a huge family and business what does evangelical Christianity have to offer anymore but a whole lot of spiritual abuse? It operates on the side of the world elite too. Religion is a soft pedal for them, where they can steer the "faithful" where ever they want them. I am sure the majority of churches except the few are lining up everyone for the vaxx. I am disappointed in my own liberal church for most lining up for the vaxx though I have not parted company over this, it is does upset me. [my beliefs fit the best into this church]</p>
<p>There is no mainstream alternative. I was in hard core fundamentalist to the max churches were even in those churches a few OPENLY talked about the new world order but those churches followed the George W Bush gospel without hesitation and I walked out of the last one for saying America should go to war with Iran.</p>
<p>Ultimately, objective morality exists whether or not people agree with it. Those that sin will reap what they sow; they do not require man to punish them for it. Those that are wise 
Yeah the new experts phony science "religion" of insanity.</p>
<p>I am glad you are in a place that is back to normal. I do consider moving. I have no friends here outside of friendly people in groups I haven't seen in a year and a half in person outside a few deliveries, [everyone I know is vaxxed]. My isolation outside of my marriage is so extreme. Most here followed without hesitation. The lack of independent thinkers here, has me very disturbed. [some African Americans may be our only exception here in they don't trust the govt as much as affluent whites do]</p>
<p>Yes I feel very lonely, here is the only place I have anywhere to talk about this stuff.</p>

        <p>Religion can be a good thing. The problem is that giving someone control over your mind and soul creates the potential for abuse.</p>
<p>As you somewhat addressed here, the callous lack of value for human life that comes from the conservative and/or evangelical side is awful. They have adopted a "conventional success over everything" viewpoint that completely discards any potential that someone might have if it does not fit the mold of what they consider praiseworthy. </p>
<p>For example, during this pandemic, the lieutenant governor of Texas stated that the elderly should be happy to sacrifice themselves to COVID to keep the economy up. That one disturbed me badly.</p>
<p>I believe the disease and response was greatly overblown, but regardless, we should never sacrifice lives in pursuit of profit. </p>
<p>Sacrifice to ensure that the younger generations have the freedom to live their lives? Sure, that's something worth sacrificing for. The elderly have willingly done that throughout the entirety of human history. </p>
<p>But laying your life down so that CEOs and shareholders can make more money that they don't even need? That's awful.</p>
<p>I feel it quite perfectly sums up the current state of that side, however. Those who are not perceived as conventionally strong or successful (such as the old, poor, or disabled) have no place in a conservative/evangelical society. </p>
<p>Their non-conventional capabilities are disregarded. They are viewed as immoral because they do not conform to arbitrary notions of success and strength. </p>
<p>The evangelicalism we have now is not objective morality either. It is a bastardization of the truth, that is Christian in name only. It primarily serves now as a cultural identifier as opposed to a path to enlightenment.</p>
<p>They have chosen to embrace sin. They are no better than the people they condemn. They have lost true religion just as the liberal atheist did, however, their corrupt pastors filled their heads with lies before the media could get to them.</p>
<p>Their pastors will by-and-large sell them out to the highest bidder. They will embrace the New Normal because they believe in worldliness over spiritual fulfillment. </p>
<p>You are right - there is no mainstream alternative church, because such a thing cannot exist. </p>
<p>A true church does not have anything to sell or promote. A true church does not need donations, it does not need a powerful head, and it does not need proselytizing. </p>
<p>You can find such a church if you look hard enough, but they are few and far between, and are almost never truly "public." The opportunity to control the spirituality of others draws power-hungry narcissists like crap draws flies. </p>
<p>If a church ever gets to mainstream level, it will be filled with people that want to use the "word of God" to further their own ends. </p>
<p>The truth will be perverted and twisted until it cannot be anymore, at which point the organization will buckle and collapse under the weight of it's own sin like we see with mainstream Catholicism and evangelical Christianity right now. </p>
<p>If you want to have a community of folks that stay true to objective morality and resist the evil that is happening right now, your best bet is to form your own. I am in the process of doing so right now. It is hard work, but rewarding. </p>
<p>In terms of moving - you definitely should if you are able. This is just the bellwether for what is to come. When the next "emergency" event happens, you can trust that it will only get worse than what you see right now.</p>
<p>Between now and the next "crisis," your neighbors will not have a change of heart and see the truth. They will only entrench themselves in their blind subservience to authority.</p>
<p>I live in the rural deep south. Folks like to claim that we are ignorant, poor, uneducated, racist, or whatever other derogatory terms they can come up with. None of that is true.</p>
<p>There is far less racism here than you might think. In the area I live in, it is mixed about equally between black and white folks, and everyone gets along just fine. There  is not the animosity between the races that is frequently seen in highly-segregated cities or suburbs of other states.</p>
<p>Pretty much nobody here trusts the government. Like you said, the black folks here almost all refuse to get vaccinated or obey pandemic measures. The state I live in has a long and dark history of doing horrific things to them, and they won't be fooled twice.</p>
<p>As for the white folks, they generally have never trusted any authority, and it is no different now. </p>
<p>Overall, nobody is willing to obey anything that the powers-that-be want to force onto us. We have our own way of life, and we like to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Most here have a different value system than is normal in the US, but they have a much more laid-back one that focuses on long-term fulfillment and minimalism as opposed to pointless consumption and overindulgence. </p>
<p>Alot of people see that and feel threatened by it, because they know that it is the most fulfilling way to live life but don't want to admit that what they are currently doing is harmful.</p>
<p>If you dislike the New Normal and the path our society is headed, a place like this might be for you. The folks here tend to be highly religious and a bit suspicious of outsiders, but honest and good once you get to know them. </p>
<p>They come together to help one another in times of need and don't value the same worldly things as most mainstream evangelicals.</p>
<p>My state technically had mandates for masks, but from day one it was never enforced outside of major institutions. </p>
<p>We have banned vaccine passports for both public and private institutions, and life is entirely back to normal here now. </p>
<p>I definitely feel ya about your last point, though. There is next to nowhere to freely discuss concerns or vent frustrations. This sub is pretty much the only place that offers even a semblance of sanity. </p>
<p>Social media evidently doesn't wish for any of us to be able to call out what is happening.</p>

        <p>Yes there is huge abuse in religion glad you admit that. It's one reason I'm out. I refused to put up with it. I think telling people they are broken and threatening constant bad things instead of showing love too, also goes into an evil place.
I am disabled, that alone is enough to lose the ability to even be a conservative. Am I supposed to go rally to starve in the gutter and have no medical care? Yeah I noticed the right wing circles consisted a lot of people who had close knit families, stable jobs, homeownership and things I didn't. So yes there is a callous lack of value for human life and abuse for the poor.
Yes if you aren't at least lower middle or high working class the fundie world [hey I was IN IT] doesn't want you. Still remember the years of church ladies with their gardens, huge yards, children, and the rest, I just could never relate to them though I tried and some were friendly then I go to the church and told things like those who don't work shouldn't eat from the pulpit etc. All supporting economic oppression on every level.</p>
<p>That's sick about that gov telling elderly people to sacrifice themselves. I believe the PCR tests made for overblown results but there is some real SARS out there affecting people.  I think mostly the push has been to sacrifice the young, otherwise why would they give experimental poison to the young who don't even get sick from Covid?</p>
<p>We can tell the elite don't care about us. You are right the religious right, when it comes to anyone who is old poor or disabled, they consider throwaways, they got their own virtue signaling too when they give out a few crumbs too. [like high carb low nutrient food at the food pantries] and then go advocate against minimum wage.
Social Darwinism is the name of the game for the religious right. It's one reason for my deconversion. While I am disaffected too as a leftist, at least I will be still allowed human dignity as a disabled person. In the fundamentalist world I was just an object to be pitied or ignored.</p>
<p>Everything yes is about success and strength in that world. Sociopathy as the highest zenith. Cold technocratic bs from the left but the right has it's sociopathy enshrined as well.
I see both as holding to evil. I bet most churches are telling their congregants to take the vaxx and submit. </p>
<p>I agree many churches are a narcissists/sociopath's happy hunting ground for prey.</p>
<p>I was in independent fundamentalist baptist churches, so think I attempted to find places like that before. My beliefs now would not fit in but thanks for the suggestion. I did know more independent minded people in the rural community I used to live in but many died off and the place was economically destroyed.
I am glad you are forming your own community. I hope it works out for you. </p>
<p>I can see things getting worse too. I think the trend is they will only become more subservient to authority too. If one is willing to give an experimental vaccine to their own children, or even risk their own lives what line won't they cross.
I am glad to hear everyone gets along fine in your Southern community. You probably are better off there. I am glad they are questioning. I never have seen so many people trust the system as much as these folks around here. I do live in a more affluent area, so maybe that is part of it.</p>
<p>Sadly I know some black people now who took the vaxx, which is shocking but yes there is more distrust for it in the African American community which makes snese.</p>
<p>You must be in one of the rare places in the USA where people question authority still. {not true here, in fact the willing subservience here has shocked the hell out of me}</p>
<p>I saw some of the old more laid back way of life in my old rural town but the economic pinchers kind of took it out. Things broke up there. I moved to that rural town to attempt a different life in the late 90s, I was happier there but you probably can see my sadness that I was forced to leave around 15 years ago.  I remember being able to talk to people in a way that simply doesn't happen here. I would even consider going back but the town's economic woes grew and I can't access the medical care I need. I got a small taste of some of what you are talking about. I was a new comer to that town back then.</p>
<p>I am glad you are in a sane state that banned vaccine passports and the rest.</p>
<p>Thanks for understanding, this is the only place I can talk about anything and a personal anonymous blog. I have noticed I've been hanging out on Facebook and social media less and less. Twitter I post same thing as here but the censorship and more has shown the limits there.</p>

        <p>I distinctly remember my boss saying once, “in this house, we believe in science”. In that moment, instantaneously, I had all of the thoughts you just articulately laid out. Well done.  It’s really easy to just try to laugh off these people and their absurd display of skim intellect, but they actually have a lot of power and influence, which is scary. I still feel pretty weird about this whole situation. It makes such little sense that I still can’t fully accept it’s actually happening. But here we are, over a year later. Wow</p>

        <p>Yea, it's crazy for sure.</p>
<p>Though, I would say that it isn't about intelligence as much as it is about mental state and ability to think freely and rationally.</p>
<p>I personally know some very smart individuals who have entirely sold out to the New Normal. These are doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc. They are not stupid by any means, nor are they gullible under normal circumstances. </p>
<p>However, these are not normal circumstances. </p>
<p>It is worth noting that not a single one of them has any strong religious conviction. They all skew liberal, and trust the media to fulfill the role of pastor that should be held by someone worthy of trust.</p>
<p>They consume media all day, every day, and have value systems that are dictated to them by the people in power. </p>
<p>They constantly are hearing about death counts, overflowing ICUs, human interest stories about granny dying, and the impending doom that will surely come any second now.</p>
<p>They have been manipulated into living in a constant state of fight-or-flight. </p>
<p>When your brain is constantly driven by fear, you cannot think rationally. The powers that be are experts at using this fear as a weapon to convince people to act contrary to their best interests. </p>
<p>Think about this scenario: you are being chased by a man-eating lion.</p>
<p>You are not going to be thinking about where you run, except that whatever direction you choose is away from the lion. </p>
<p>You definitely are not going to stop and think about the long-term implications of your actions; there is no time for that. There is absolutely zero room here to consider the philosophical ramifications of what you are doing.</p>
<p>You decide to run and jump into a lake, believing that the lion cannot swim. And it can't, so you're safe from the lion now.</p>
<p>However, the water was infested with crocodiles, and you just got eaten by one. </p>
<p>In this scenario, your fear-driven brain prevented you from thinking rationally. You never would have jumped into that lake normally, as you knew it had every manner of danger in it.</p>
<p>That is what is happening right now - these folks are driven to their doom by people who wish to use them for their own gain. These people are masters of fear.</p>
<p>After reading the last part of your comment, if you are interested, I have something you can do that will make you really take note of what is happening and will help you to see future attempts at manipulating your mind. </p>
<p>It will really wake you up with regards to the extent that you are being acted on by those in power, and just how pervasive their influence is.</p>
<p>Whenever you read the news, take a count of the number of times negative words or phrases are used.</p>
<p>Keep a tally of the times you see words such as "death," "killed," "harmed," "sick," "injured," etc. that have negative connotations. </p>
<p>Then, keep a tally of the number of times you see words with positive connotations. If it says "promising," "uplifting," "fortunate," etc. take note of it.</p>
<p>If the article has more negative references than positive, you can be sure that you are being conditioned to fear whatever it is they are describing. </p>
<p>If it is more positive than negative, you are being conditioned to trust what they are describing. </p>
<p>For example - in an article about COVID or Trump, it will be almost entirely doom-and-gloom. </p>
<p>In one about vaccines or Biden, it will be cheerful and happy.</p>
<p>With any subject, you can choose to portray the same exact news in a positive or negative light.</p>
<p>For example, under Trump, 1000 new COVID cases would be a cause for great worry, and a foreboding sign that there was about to be a new "wave" that would leave bodies rotting in the streets. </p>
<p>Under Biden, 1000 new cases is worthy of celebration, and a sure sign that the pandemic is ending soon.</p>
<p>They choose to foster fear or trust in certain things through the phrasing of their work. Nothing the media or government does is unintentional. </p>
<p>Now that you know this, take note of it, and never wonder again how people think this way. They are being constantly conditioned to behave exactly as those in power want them to, and unless someone can get through to them, that will never change. </p>
<p>Make sure that you don't fall prey to the insidious efforts of the perpetrators of this "New Normal." It could happen to any of us if we are not careful.</p>

        <p>I totally see what your saying and have always noticed the conditioning attempts. And I’m not trying to pretend that everyone of the people are stupid, but I do believe there is a distinct difference between intelligence and education. Truth be told, if you did a study, I’d imagine that most branch covidians are more formally educated than the average NNN poster. I’d bet my lunch on it. To your credit on what you’ve  been saying, it seems like the formal education was more religious indoctrination than anything. We have the most dogmatic people of our society claiming intellectual superiority, based on a list of credentials that built up their dogma. I’m not an expert, but ones proclivity to be more or less easily put into a sense of fight or flight, where rationality goes out the window, should, in my opinion, be a part of the formula that tallies intelligence. In my mind, intelligence and survivability go hand in hand.  But it’s all relative to the time your in. If Albert Einstein lived in a different time and died when he was 15 bc he couldn’t make a fire after falling in cold waters, people would probably consider him dumb despite the fact he had the intellectual abilities that he did.</p>

        <p>I kind of went on ramble there, but long story short. I do think that we’re obviously all capable of being put into a high adrenaline fight or flight state. But the level at which a massive amount of people didn’t/don’t seem to be able to differentiate between major threat/minor threat is perplexing to me. We could probably banter all day long about hypochondria, ease of survivability in today’s America, social media(the most threatening virus), humans propensity for group think. I feel like there’s an infinite amount of reasons for this shit show. Think about this. How many of these zealots would agree that big pharma can’t be trusted in their intentions just 18 months ago? Like, how many people, probably, used their distrust of big pharma as a part of their identity. Now look at them. It’s hard to view them as intelligent</p>

        <p>I think the education system is extremely toxic, and it's full blown indoctrination. My SO is highly intelligent, not just saying that but she's top 2 or 3 in every test and class for her engineering degree. The irrelevant stuff they have to write in their essays and questions the professors work into <em>engineering</em>  and stuff like physics and hard science is disgusting. It's all online so I'm always in the background hearing it and I've only heard one or two students actually challenge it. Their grade suffers if they do for getting the "science" wrong. She questions it all and sees right through it but she wants to keep her A.</p>
<p>Last week one of the professors asked if everyone was vaccinated and only one guy had the balls to say he wanted to see longer term testing. The professor shut the sound off so fast it was uncomfortable to see everyone just sitting on their zoom screens wondering where the sound went. It's all crazy but I don't think education has anything to with intelligence a lot of the time, because so many of those students actually fully agree in the group discussions and stuff. No one wants to stick out, and the brainwashing works on a whole lot of them over time. Listening in the background I can totally get how people with degrees tend to be the lockdown proponents. I only went for an English degree and I thought when my professors pushed leftist stuff that it was just because those classes are subjective and teachers are liberal, but nope. They do it in even the hard science fields. I think you have to be smart to question everything, educated or not. Anyways I think we're screwed with the people universities are churning out now.</p>
