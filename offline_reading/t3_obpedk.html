    <strong>At the ledge, down and out</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Seattle and it has become a deeply entrenched worshiper at the Church of Branch Covidians.</p>
<p>It appears to be only a matter of time before the COVID acolytes in Olympia in conjunction with Seattle officials and the governor mandate a vaccine passport. And before that, as we have seen, employers are beginning to make this a prerequisite to hiring.</p>
<p>My company is surprisingly taking the don't ask, don't tell approach but they "encourage" vaccination.</p>
<p>And to me...it is only a matter of time before that changes to a mandate.</p>
<p>I hate Seattle. Philosophically, politically, it is filled to the brim with blind followers of the ruling elite. Nothing to like and it is no longer the city I grew up in and loved.</p>
<p>The glaring problem is I have a lease here, a job here...all the trappings of building a life. A number of entanglements that take time to break free from.</p>
<p>This is the first time I feel like they have worn me down. I'm down to the point where I am saying fuck it, get the shots to just protect myself from losing my job or being caught up in some mess where I become a pariah because I refuse the experimental jab.</p>
<p>Or maybe just move. Dedicate a job search effort in a state not wholly brainwashed and start anew.</p>
<p>What do you folks think? People must be in similar situations. Anything is helpful. Feeling beaten down and out.</p></p>

        <p>Didn't the governor of Oregon try using vaccine passports for something like 3 days before giving up on it because it was so unworkable?</p>

        <p>At the current pace, I’d say we’re soon reaching a point where numbers can no longer be ignored by the media/puppet masters. That, or either they get aggressive with vaccination and there will be an uprising. Maybe they’re already working on a plan b for the vaccine intaking. 
Here in Portugal, vaccine scheduling just opened for my age bracket - let’s see if I’m going to be approached to take it..</p>

        <p>I’m a former Seattleite who just bought a place up north near Bellingham in the woods to get away from
It all. I work from home so was able to do this- have you considered remote work? You know the north and east of WA are pretty much like a different state as is so you may not have to go too far!</p>
