    <strong>Mourning the loss of our way of life</strong>
    <p><p><strong>As I write this, I am in a state of depressive mourning, which is both personal and impersonal.</strong></p>
<p>Tl;dr As someone who had been consciously isolating since 2017, I can tell you that it is no way to live.</p>
<p>I am first off mourning my own life, which had so much potential that I blew away because of drugs (Adderall for an ADHD misdiagnosis) which made me go from being the most popular and social person I knew to become paranoid/suspicious of everyone and isolating back in 2017. I had to drop out of school and decided to work on myself a bit.</p>
<p>I deleted my social media, too at the time as I felt so disappointed in myself and romanticized the "living off the grid" mentality (I probably just needed a social media break). Initially, it felt very liberating, as it felt rebellious to isolate and could still continue living since the world was "normal" and active, and I could live vicariously through others who were social. (I also didn't become a full hermit/bum, I still continued my education and got fit and went into therapy, but lost touch with 90% of the people I knew.)</p>
<p>With the pandemic, however, we are now forced, ordered to stay home and isolate, so rebellion presents itself as precisely being social again, which I have been doing by reaching out to people from my past individually and meeting and catching up.</p>
<p>I realize now more than ever that we are social animals and require a sense of community and belonging to live well.</p>
<p>So not only am I mourning the life that I had before the pandemic as well as my social media presence, but I am also mourning the white,  middle-class American lifestyle (traveling, meeting with friends at bars, going to concerts) that I and others enjoyed (or had the potential to enjoy), which will not be coming back for the foreseeable future. And since now we rely totally on social media to stay connected, without having it I feel like a ghost.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The first lockdown in March-April 2020 seemed almost like a healthy, rational response (like "OK let's just close down for a few weeks, and then in summer we will be back"). But now there is a sense of things dragging on and on with no clear end, and it's not so much oppression setting in as it is depression. People do not know what to desire even and long-term plans have all been put on hold. And each of us are more or less expected to deal with isolation on our own (get a therapist), we cannot collectively find a way out or socially mobilize (at least there is reddit).</p>
<p>Finally, there is my therapist of two years who died in May 2020 when the lockdowns had begun (died tragically being hit by a car). I could not grieve properly, as there was no funeral because of the quarantine. He was an incredible person and I will never forget him. I have since found a new therapist, though.</p>
<p>What worries me is something that people are not aware enough of (something which is more than just mental, psychic breakdown), namely, that our basic understanding of the world - the way we relate to external reality and to social reality, how we communicate with others - is shattered.</p>
<p>And psychic, mental breakdowns are going on all around. It's literally that our everyday norms, or simply the unwritten rules which regulate our interaction, are threatened so that the way it appears natural for us to behave with others is threatened.</p>
<p>We should not underestimate this radical dimension: our whole life-world is changing, and it's deeply unnatural.</p>
<p>To conclude, if the first wave was purely medical, and if all we do now is focus on the economy, then the third wave (if it will be called that) will be mental health.</p></p>

        <p>I hear that because I have a similar story. I was living totally off grid in another country for 7 years, with no social media, and I lost touch with most of my friends. Before that I was also living in isolation for 5 more years. I realised in 2019 that I'd pushed it too far and desperately needed to be sociable again so I came back to the UK. But I'd made myself so socially anxious that I was too scared to even reach out to anyone for months. </p>
<p>As soon as I started going some yoga classes in 2020, we got shut down and told to isolate. The last year has been the most difficult year of my life in terms of mental health and I'm only just starting to build back some positivity with the aid of tai chi, plenty of exercise and a few rebellious people who ignored the lockdowns and organised a weekly outdoor dance. Unfortunately they got busted 2 weeks ago though, so Im back on my own again.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing your story as well, I am glad you were able to relate. I see you also have attempted to regain your sense of self and belonging through social and other activities during the pandemic. </p>
<p>It is definitely difficult to do but I think it is possible, I encourage you to keep at it and to reconnect with old friends. I am sorry to hear that the dance sessions got busted, I just wish you strength to deal with the isolation during these times.</p>

        <p>thanks, yeah same for you. There's another side to my story, which I dont want to share but I lost some really good old friends last year either because we disagree on the scamdemic or because they disagree with my life choices. All I can do is keep pushing myself onwards.</p>

        <p>I get where you’re coming from, it’s totally natural to feel that way. It’s great living off grid but you need a community, close friends with families that you can socialize with. Personally I’m fine living alone with my dog for months at a time with little contact with other people, but that’s not something everyone can do. My wife definitely needs social interaction on atleast a weekly basis so we’ve made friends who are like minded and try to do dinners or bbqs atleast once a week.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I am lucky enough that I was popular before and can still ride on that popularity by having a huge network of people I can still reach out to. Moreover, I have about 10-20 close friends still and a loving family, but I just no longer see myself as the leader that I once was in the community. It may take time to rebuild myself but I want to try somehow, I want the feelings of pain to go away. I may remake a social media by having an art presence, or may not. I am doing my best to see friends at least 2-3 times a week.</p>
