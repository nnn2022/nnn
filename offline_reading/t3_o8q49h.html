        <p>Yeah, I actually hope were wrong but at some point the evidence was too much to keep in my head at once so I started keeping a timeline.</p>
<p>The scary thing is -- I rarely look into any detail and find a dead end... instead, it just unfolds into more and more "coincidences" that most people aren't even aware of.</p>
<p>As just one example - mapping the World Pandemic Bonds followed by a partnership with WHO 6 months later... Then obtaining the prospectus for those bonds (which is no longer available online where it once was) --- then you see a complex set of events that must take place for the bonds to not pay out...</p>
<p>Then suddenly the way testing was handled - by testing only the sickest people first to get a high percentage of death --- followed by widespread testing with high cycle threshold PCR tests to generate false positives, followed by unusual death counts where ALL deaths within 30-60 days of once of these false positive tests, to get the death count up -- and then remember the global push of recovering patients into nursing homes...</p>
<p>5 Democratic governors did that in the United States, and several of them set rules that forbade the nursing homes from testing these incoming patients for Covid-19!!!</p>
<p>All of this combined to be the exact combination needed for the World Bank Pandemic Bonds to not pay out.</p>
<p>The bonds were 500 million dollars oversubscribed by 200%, but that number is far more significant because they used complex financial instruments and credit default swaps so that it somehow added up to be more than just 500m. (Similar to the craziness in the subprime mortgage repackaging of 2008.)</p>
<p>Anyhow -- all of that "coincidentally" added up so that the investment was never returned to the bondholders.</p>
<p>All of that is 100% real (and just the tip of the iceberg) -- but you might wonder why there wasn't more controversy?</p>
<p>I believe the most significant bondholders bought in knowing they would lose the investment. I suspect they did this as a means to launder the money which was then distributed around the world to finance this operation. (Paying off officials, etc.)</p>
<p>And again, it's the tip of the iceberg. When you start to look into Moderna you find out some VERY suspicious activities, suggesting they knew what was coming. This includes a patent agreement with the NIAID showing that their Covid-19 vaccine was actually completed Dec 12, 2019.</p>
<p>Oh, theres just so much...</p>
<p>But it's all right out in the open. They don't even have to hide it because the average person doesn't have the mental ability or attention span to understand what is happening.</p>
<p>They just stare at the rancher, like dumb cows, oblivious to what goes on inside the barn.</p>

<p>World Bank Launches First-Ever Pandemic Bonds to Support $500 Million Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility</p>
<p>In an effort to fight the next pandemic faster, the World Bank has turned to global financial markets, issuing $425 million in “pandemic bonds” and related derivatives to pay for emergency relief.</p>
<p>The World Bank’s bond sale was 200% oversubscribed, with investors eager to get their hands on the high-yield returns on offer. The majority of buyers were from Europe and included dedicated catastrophe-bond investors, pension funds, and asset managers.</p>
<p>(hint: Investors lose their money when a pandemic is declared in 2020. I'm GUESSING this is how they raised money to pay off officials globally, and many of the biggest investors probably knew they would lose... But gain it back during the pandemic.)</p>

<p>Coronavirus spread triggers World Bank pandemic bond payout (investors lose their money)</p>
<p>A controversial World Bank bond designed to deliver funding to help the world’s poorest countries to tackle fast-spreading diseases is set to pay out, the lender said, though it is unclear when funds will reach the countries in need.</p>
<p>SPECULATION: The biggest investors may have bought-in knowing the bond would never pay out, as a way to launder money internationally for the payoffs needed to finance this pandemic. (They recouped their investment as lockdown &amp; vaccine profiteers?)</p>

        <p>Try a small dose bro start whit a gram. I dont want you to take too much and bad trip. If you micro dose a gram ( or maybe a bit more but dont go into trippy experience yet) you will feel pure joy in your heart for no reason and feel connected to the real world and feel good doing nothing but a walk in the sun. 
Also it might trigger some suicidal tendencies so be careful having someone around you just to make sure you go well. Like dont be scared its rare af</p>
