    <strong>Revelations scripture. The mark of the beast.</strong>
    <p><p>Revelation 13:1-5 (KJV)  And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.
And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.Revelation 13:6-10 (KJV)  And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.
And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
If any man have an ear, let him hear.
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.Revelation 13:11-15 (KJV)  And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.Revelation 13:16-18 (KJV)  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</p>
<p>Revelation 14:9-11 (KJV)  And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</p>
<p>Revelation 19:19-20 (KJV)  And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</p>
<p>Revelation 20:4 (KJV)  And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</p></p>

        <p>See, as a non-believer, I still see the Bible as a document full of allegories and lessons about society, quite often written by pretty wise people. I won't take it literally, but I won't dump it into the trashcan either. Humankind has changed far less than we'd like.</p>

        <p>It is clear you have no idea, and that's ok. Those who don't have the guidance of the Holy Spirit don't understand and we know this.</p>
<p>However,  according to your doctrine, time spent on Reddit is also not time spent affecting reality.</p>
<p>So maybe go play with your pet or something?</p>

        <p>These passages make it seem as if the antichrist is required to be known before the mark occurs. That those who take the mark, although deceived, are aware they're doing it in allegiance to the antichrist. The mark could not be a vaccine, because it isn't pledging allegiance to the one that was maimed by the sword and survived. The temple must also be rebuilt. There is so much yet to happen that this seems to early.</p>
<p>I do not believe the vaccine is the mark. Though I do believe this is the foundation. </p>

        <p>https://youtu.be/NR_MsVxXzAA This is a link that explains the connection between covid and the mark. </p>
<p>My opinion is that the vaccine is connected to the mark. 
Revelation 13:16-17 (KJV)  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
What are the vaccination cards for if not the first step towards this? </p>

Crypto currency is an implanted chip. Patent #606060 </p>
<p>As for being maimed by the sword perhaps that means the word of God.
Ephesians 6:17 (KJV)  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</p>

        <p>Do you think the vaccine is the mark that will cause us to be separated from God forever if we take it? Or is that incoming?</p>

        <p>I think the vaccine is leading up to the mark. The mark itself I believe will be the crypto currency. My understanding is that the believers will be raptured before the actual mark takes place.</p>
<p>Revelation 7:2-10 (KJV)  And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.
Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;
And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.</p>
<p>The enforced mark takes place in Revelation 13.</p>

        <p>This isn't the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast won't be secretive as a "got one over you" type of thing. It's going to be something where you willingly and knowingly choose to identify yourself with the antichrist.</p>

        <p>I agree. I believe that the body of Christ will be raptured out before the mark gets implemented. I just believe the people that are left will have to willingly and knowingly choose to identify themselves with the antichrist.<br>

        <p>To me it sounds like  they will be forced and intimidated in  to take the mark or starve because they won't be able to buy or sell without it. Also the beast causes them to take the mark.
It sounds like the beast will be thought of as a god because he will do miracles.
Revelation 13:14 (KJV)  And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:16-17 (KJV)  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
