    <strong>All This Is Doing Is Creating Another Rift Between People.</strong>
    <p><p>On my throwaway as reddit bots have got out of hand blocking accounts that posted in other subreddits.</p>
<p>I was raised to always respect others even when they don't believe the same things as you. For the past 25 years of my life I have slowly seen that sentiment fade away. </p>
<p>We used to be people who could marry each other even with different political beliefs. Around the time everyone got into social media I seen the respect for one another's political beliefs get destroyed [Example: "See this Political Extremist he is exactly how all _____(Insert liberals or conservatives here) are"]</p>
<p>We continued further and further til reliance political affiliations are as strong, if not stronger then older religious affiliations of the 50s.  </p>
<p>Now we have moved into the whole vax or anti-vax argument with the whole covid crisis we have been going through. No one got all uptight if you didn't take the flu shot like the covid shot. Heck even then I had multiple family members get the flu shot and still get the flu. More people had understood there may be a bad flu vaccine every once in a while that may not be as good as another years. </p>
<p>Imagine going on a date and telling them you didn't get the most recent flu shot and that being the deal breaker. Seems fictional until you change Flu to Covid.</p>
<p>What's next? Making a divide based on favorite colors? "Fuschia and purple color fans only please"</p>
<p>TLDR: Society keeps finding this to divide us on when it should be finding ways to bring all sides together for the embetterment of our futures.</p></p>

        <p>This may be an unpopular opinion but I no longer care about unity or "coming together" anymore. Whenever I look around, all I see is people content with being livestock. The pandemic was eye opening for me in that regard. The "freedom" we sing about can be taken away at the stroke of the pen, our lives can be halted and we can lose everything over night.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm not looking for unity, I'm moving in the opposite direction.</p>

        <p>I always get the flu a few days or a week after taking the flu shot. I stopped because it became so repetitive. Then my wife would continue to take it and then get the flu right away and I wouldn't. This went on for like 3 years and then 2 years ago, she stopped taking it and stopped getting the flu right away. We still sometimes got it, but less often and not right at the beginning of fall. </p>
<p>Yes, we are divided. Yes the government and big business are the beneficiaries, but they are exploiting a trait in people and people are willing to let them. These traits are nothing new, just now they are promoted and magnified so that they can then be directed to whatever end the elite want.</p>

        <p>The entire divide, from masking/vaxing, "social justice" , racial tensions, to... you name it... can all be condensed down to cognitive dissonance. And the apparent inversion of the entirety of the official narrative is what exposes IT as the mass campaign of promoting cognitive dissonance for the purpose of mass mind control that it is. Then, the inversion continues as that side accuses ours of being the one suffering from cognitive dissonance! All in keeping with the narcissistic tendency to project...</p>

        <p>Politics replaced religion. Most people on the anti-Covid vaccine (purposely use this language because anti-vaxx has a negative connotation, and the left is trying to conflate the two ideologies) do not care if you get a vaccine, people on the vaccine side generally care if you don’t. That’s the difference, freedom of choice versus blind compliance.</p>

        <p>We have tried to tolerate, ignore and even accept the other side. They are not willing to compromise and I'm not willing to throw my morals and values down the toliet for them. I removed them from my life and got some sanity back.  If they change their attitude and stop being so hateful and nasty then if they come back and apologize then I'm willing to forgive them. But I'm not letting them drag me down with them.</p>

        <p>It's ok, we enjoy watching trolls and shills come unglued here! It adds some humor to the depressing reality, and cements the idea for us here that you all are getting just what you deserve!
But if you get tired of being our punchline, you can always go back to covidiots or many of the other "safe place" subs for your ilk.
