    <strong>My cloth facemask has become quite hellish at my work of late...(Seeking input, advice)</strong>
    <p><p>So my state has arbitrarily set june 28th as the date the mask order ends for all. It has been lifted for almost a month for those who have been "vaccinated". I recently found out that some people at my work haven't been wearing the mask and that no one has asked them to prove vax status... This is great, don't get me wrong... My issue is... well multifaceted I guess... I have been vocal to bosses and co-workers about not getting a vaccine and my reasons for doing so... natural immunity being paramount among them. So there is that. Now the mask has been hell the last few weeks. Have had several heat waves, and though my workplace is air-conditioned... it is an old building and airflow is definitely spotty depending on where I am stationed. And my work is reasonably labor intensive... so I am already a big man who sweats and requires oxygen... And now my sweat and the heat have created a veritable oven where my breathing holes are. For the last year, my work has been very strict about the masks and proper wearing and only allowing to take them off when in our employee dining room... But again... With the end so close and the segregation, I think my bosses have taken a hands off approach... Let me summarize... I think these last few weeks especially the mask has become a definite danger to my health. The excess heat in the mask and I really can taste the stale air I am breathing... moist, hot, stale air... And I am positive I am breathing in bacteria. I am not as concerned anymore with the lack of oxygen... more concerned with the hot wet environment in which I am breathing and worried about getting bacterial pneumonia. I also had panic attacks a week or so ago because it all came crashing down on me at once and I finally realized in a very real and visceral way... that this is designed to hurt me... to perhaps even kill me. It really dawned on me that this is nefarious... now again I knew all this... but it hit me in a different way since these latest heat waves... I actually feel in danger.... Sorry for running on... My thinking, although perhaps derranged, was to just suffer as much as possible and wait until the order is lifted to unmask at work so that #1 people know I didn't break down and get the jab... and #2 so I remember the suffering all the more and the segregation and remember it well so I can have the conviction to never put one on ever again over my dead body type deal... But there is door #3 where I am thinking... why shouldn't I just take it off, if no one will say anything to me... worse case scenario I get fired... But at least I will be breathing normally with my face naked and not putting myself in danger anymore of disease or bacterial infection.... I know this is long.. I am having a couple beers after feeling disgusting and hacking up probably co2, baceteria laden mucus after finishing my shift earlier in the evening... Any input would be appreciated and advice. Thank you as always to this subreddit and all of you thinking beings who contribute here and have helped me so much over the last year. This really is the molten core of grounded sanity in an absolute satanic clownworld sideshow of a year... and a half? How long has it been again? FUCK! Help me. lol Thanks again. Sincerely... a fellow human being who has been running this race for so long with mind in tact... and feeling both mind and body weakening and suffering right here at the end... or the end of part 1. The mask. In my state. Sincerely, thank you all.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks... You understand my dilemma though, yea? Do I rightfully breathe and claim my rights... do I lie if someone asks if I got the vaxx? Do I brush them off and say none of your business? Or do I just take it off and if someone asks I say that the arbitrary date is 3 days away, you think it isn't safe now but it will be in 3 days? Or do I lie? Or do I suffer the final days so no one thinks I broke down and got the shots... so then I can always claim the moral high ground when discussing the il-treatment and suffering?</p>

        <p>I really want people to know that I did not get the shot. I am a likeable person and intelligent guy. I know people listen when I speak and watch me when I act. I don't want to wrongfully influence someone who perhaps would look at me and say oh... he got the vaccine? Well he is smart and he seems ok so maybe I should get it? I couldn't live with the thought of selling a vaccine by virtue of dropping the mask prematurely... even if it will benefit my health short term and maybe long term. I do recognize that my dental health has taken a HIT as well. The masks are so gross... I am cooking my fucking beautiful smile my teeth are yellow as hell now even in the front where I brush religiously and have always stayed white until this year. And the other stuff I mentioned... I am genuinely worried any day I could incubate a bacterium that puts me in a hospital... and we all know what can happen then!</p>

        <p>I understand. But the time to influence others has passed in your specific case I think. </p>
<p>Stop wearing the mask immediately. It’s torture. It’s filthy. It’s dangerous. </p>

How inappropriate it is to discuss personal health issues in the workplace.</p>

        <p>I live in New York City and I am surrounded by unstable lunatics. I don't wear a mask ninety-nine percent of the time but there is that 1% of the time when I need to put it on to get into a store. I bought a couple of these off of etsy and they are great. They look like a normal masks but they're made out of cheesecloth. You can't see through them so people aren't going to know. But you can breathe very easily through these masks. Theyre so much better than the Disposable masks or any other cloth mask. They're made specifically for someone in a situation like you are where you have to wear a mask but you're over it and you just want to breathe.</p>

        <p>I appreciate it... I probably should have bought something like this or the fake mask usa ones a month ago when it was apparent that this medicinal apartheid joke was going to go on for a month... But I have one week left and really only 3 days because of vacation time I put in for... sadly my first vacation day is the 28th which is the day the order is lifted so I can't strut into work sans mask and show my elation for having my basic human rights back.... But anyway... not going to spend any money on a mask... I blew like 80 bucks on amazon when I first found out I'd need them for work and just bought a bunch of different gaiters etc. to see what would be tolerable...But again... the one I've been wearing IS breathable it is mesh with holes where if you look close in light you can see my face... but the problem is the heatwave this summer has brought and the heat and moisture turn a breathable mask into a veritable death trap for the breathing process. I try not to talk to people and sort of remain in a meditative state of breathing but I am a human and I talk to people and perform my job with enthusiasm but by the second half of my shift the mask becomes unbearable. It is even worse seeing happy human faces enjoying fresh air and their human dignity and rights restored to them... I am not mad at them, of course... well maybe a few who are proud of the vax etc...lol funny thing is most of the people who are fully vaccinated and can by decree remove their masks dutifully keep wearing them!! They are still scared! It is summer! The only people getting sick are getting pneumonia from masks!</p>

        <p>I am laughing in a sad way because I know exactly how you feel. I have gone through all the possible outcomes in my head. I wear an half mask. I try to be as friendly and funny as possible. No one has said anything to me. I always say,  "I'm a big girl I gotta breathe." It is absolutely disgusting when I think about how often I touch my mask and then take it of then put it back on. I mean seriously those things are disgusting. Sticking my nose out it the best way I have figured to cope. Also, Like you I was vocal about not wanting the jab. I am counting down these days. Seriously.</p>

        <p>Get yourself a pulse oximeter. It shows oxygen saturation of your blood. If it shows that your oxygen levels are below normal, you could use that as a defense for taking off your mask to take a breath. https://www.walmart.com/ip/Finger-Pulse-Oximeter-Blood-Oxygen-Saturation-SpO2-Heart-Rate-O2-Monitor-CE-LED/167776823?selected=true</p>

        <p>If there is no way around wearing one and you don’t want to get a different job, I’d suggest looking into the “Breathable” mask options on Etsy. There are a bunch of ones that look normal but let you breathe much easier.</p>

        <p>In addition to the etsy masks, I found one on amazon that's made as a "sports" mask that comes with a replaceable filter.  "Forget" to insert the filter and it's pretty easy to breath in.</p>
<p>Bonus points: I do a lot of talking while working.  It doesn't muffle you or distort your speech.</p>
<p>The one I have was made for large headed people as well.  I have been graced with an actual size 8 head, and buying Headwear of any sort is a chore.</p>

<p>If everyone who believed that the masks were pointless and uncomfortable took them off, then this would all start to fall apart bit by bit. I feel this is a major sticking point for this continuing.</p>

        <p>Enough is enough.</p>
<p>Take the mask off; you shouldn't submit to this any longer. You also don't need to lie about getting vaccinated. Probably worth getting a mask exemption from your doctor -- if you haven't signed anything agreeing to wear the mask then you'll have grounds if terminated.</p>
<p>Also: time a for a new job &amp; a new life in Florida.</p>

        <p>I know people don’t like to hear this and not everyone can do it but I would quit. I quit my last job. Not just because of the masks, there were many other reasons but I looked on their website and they’re one of few places around where I live still requiring it. I don’t regret it at all aside from working there in the first place</p>

        <p>look up mesh/gauze masks on etsy. also a lil drop or two of anti-bacterial essential oil in your favourite scent couldnt hurt. if u can, change the mask in the middle of the day to a clean one</p>
