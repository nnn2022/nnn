    <strong>How many are seriously resisting wearing masks? Even if it means getting locked up?</strong>
    <p><p>How many are resisting mask wearing in stores and elsewhere? We were told 2 weeks to flatten the curve its been almost 8 months. I have been refusing to wear a mask in stores now for about 2 months and for the most part, I am met with little to  no resistance, with the exception of  today. Today I went into a Staples to buy some ink for my printer, soon as I walk in Sir, you need to wear a mask, I said no I have a health condition. Walked over to the ink, knew exactly what I needed, and I can only assume was the manger walked over, I said are we really going to do this, I want some ink...I have a health condition and so I am not wearing a mask. The long and short of it he said you can wait in the vestibule if you want and I'll get it for you..whatever. All of a sudden 3 cop cars come pulling up. I was like listen, I'm not wearing a mask and I have been sitting here now 15-20 minutes in the vestibule and I guess they called the cops. The cop was really nice he pretty much agreed that its BS and he physically went in with my credit card and bought the ink for me...which is just ridiculous! He did take my name of course and look at my drivers license so he can fill out his report. But I am at a point now where its time to just make a stand. I said, am I being arrested, he said I won't do that. But it might come to a point where they will do that. I was luck I had a decent cop who also thought it was BS. As I was standing there I was saying to some customers walking in you know you don't really have to wear that mask...and they agreed...with the usual but I need something, etc, etc. I said to one guy, look if 10, 15, 20 of us walked in with no mask what are they going to do? And the answer is nothing. This ends when we say it ends. There is no proof a  mask even helps and we are not in a pandemic, this is a flu at best and viruses never disappear even with vaccines, they may become endemic, but they do not disappear. If people would just stand up and say I've had enough maybe it would encourage others. I have a family and a wife, I'm no young guy...but its the principle of thing now. What will be next? A forced vaccine? Not being allowed to buy, travel, go see a concert, etc without a mask, vaccine, temperature check, proof of vaccination? We need to wake up folks. Most places I walk in without a  mask say nothing at all. How many of you are standing against this crap? This is how tyrannical governments are born.</p></p>

        <p>You are absolutely right, a tyranny is being born before our eyes in the name of staying safe from a virus.    Your experience is exactly the reason I reluctantly wear a mask, i don't want my shopping trips to constantly involve confrontations with employees, other customers, or cops.   It doesn't help that I live in a non-rural area...its always worse there.        </p>
<p>But your post is spot on and I think the key is numbers, like you mentioned.    If 20 people walked into the Staples without masks, they probably couldn't or wouldn't do anything.   The resistance needs more organization, not just the random person, here and there.</p>

        <p>Exactly. We need massive parties of maskless shoppers. Flash mobs. Sit-ins. Et cetera. Black Friday is almost here; the perfect time for mass non-compliance and civil disobedience.</p>

        <p>I haven't worn a mask through the whole thing, most people don't say anything. You're absolutely right, it's a principal thing. If we don't do something it's only going to get worse. Problem is we need more people who will actually refuse to wear them instead of just saying how dumb it is but doing it anyway.</p>

        <p>I think the best thing is to just ignore them, and keep walking. If they chase you through the store just because you don't want to wear a muzzle (The horror! One person without a muzzle, how, oh how, will we survive?!) you can pretend you're deaf or don't speak English, which is something I might do if anyone does that with me. I know sign language and I speak Swedish, which hardly anyone speaks in the US, so if I just speak to them in Swedish, they won't understand me and just give up, I hope. I could just "Jag kan inte engelska, jag har ingen aning vem du där eller vad du vill, var snäll och lämna mig i fred..." away and they'd hopefully just leave me alone after a while since it'd be awkward. Or if all else fails, just get really emotional saying it's against your religion to cover your face and if you can't get groceries you'll starve and if they still give you trouble, turn it back around on them saying them not letting you get groceries will kill you so they're murdering you. I've thought a lot about these things I could do to get them off my back if it would ever get that far that they chase me around, but so far I haven't had to do it much. Just a few times, and I played the religion card and it helps that I can cry on cue because I started crying saying that I can't cover my face and I'll starve if I can't buy food, and they were just like "Okay, okay, calm down, I'm sorry, I understand." Thankfully, I haven't had to go that far a lot, but it has happened on occasion.</p>

        <p>That's crazy you've had to go that far at all! Least you know how to handle it though. I haven't had too much trouble thankfully, only a few encounters and mostly they're polite, and I ignore them as much as I can. My sister actually was chased out of a store today though. She told them she has an exemption and they harrassed her about it asking why and wanted to detain her from leaving the store when she tried to walk out. Luckily her husband was with her and he has the look of someone you don't mess with so it didn't get physical or anything. She's going to report them. People are just totally mental these days.</p>

        <p>Have yet to put one on. The cops around here are refusing to enforce any of the governors bullshit so that's nice. Only resistance I've gotten is all the death glares from the Karen's, but those just give me a warm fuzzy feeling knowing I'm probably ruining their days.</p>

        <p>&rt;<em>I was lucky I had a decent cop who also thought it was BS</em></p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Then why did he bother to show up? He literally could have not come to the call. Since he did, why did he feel the need to take your driver's license information?</p>
<p>If your area has medical exemptions from mask wearing, than the store manager is actually the one guilty of breaking your local bylaw by calling the cops on you. Especially pulling a sneak move like having you wait, thinking he is going to get your item for you, while he rats you out. </p>
<p><em>He is the one who should have been fined or arrested, not you.</em> </p>
<p>You should name and shame this manager - and his store - all over social media.</p>
<p>And in answer to your question... No, I don't wear a mask, anywhere, for anyone.</p>

        <p>The only shopping I really do is at the grocery store. I quit going to Whole Foods instead opting for a smaller/lower quality regional chain because they don't seem to give a shit if I wear a mask in there or not.</p>

        <p>Nope I have never worn a mask and I never will.  It saddens me that it's a true rarity that I ever see another person bare faced.  Here we are online in numbers but it doesn't exist in my day to day encounters.</p>

        <p>If that Danish mask study came out and proved they worked, and nobody was threatening me with a fine, then I <em>might</em> think about wearing one - actually, fuck that! It's the principle really, isn't it? I don't really think that the paranoid misophobes still cowering at home in fear of this nothingburger virus ought to dictate to the rest of us what we can or can't do. I conceded when they made them compulsory on buses - but that wasn't fucking good enough for them, was it? They had to force them in shop, then when you're not sitting down in the pub - and what did they do but get us another lockdown? Pretty soon it'll be masks outside, everywhere, like some other countries. Because that seems to be the key factor informing covid policy around here.</p>
<p>I think I'm starting to pluck up the courage to admit that I honest to God don't give a fuck about 'protecting people', as they put it - at least not people's fragile sense of security. Sorry, but your Gran is not my concern. I didn't give a fuck about the flu before. My cousin died in 2009 of H1N1 and nobody gave a fuck about her. We have been asked to sacrifice more than what is reasonable. A reasonable sacrifice would be to ask me to wash my hands and leave off the big Greek weddings for the foreseeable. Not sacrificing my entire life for somebody else's Gran. My empathy only goes so far. This completely unreasonable extension of personal culpability is perverse and toxic. </p>
<p>You don't gain anything by giving inch to these bedwetters and little hitlers. The moment they started demanding absurdly punitive fines and imprisonment for 'rule breakers' was the moment they lost the argument. As Jefferson said, when injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty. There's no being reasonable - you can't reason a person out of something they didn't reason themselves into. </p>

That was back in April. </p>
<p>I hate masks, mostly because it’s super disturbing to see everyone looking like scared mindless zombies. Has nothing to do with them being uncomfortable. Although, I’m sure they are.</p>

        <p>I think the train is moving too fast to stop it at this point. I'm just trying to stay low key and off the radar. I believe they may be using this also as an opportunity to begin "listing" people in the same way that you are required to be reported to the state health dept as a "infectious disease case" if you test positive with one of their phony tests.</p>
<p>I would bet that something is being flagged in the system when police respond to a call regarding mask compliance. It may sound "crazy" or paranoid but the way things are going, I think it may be wise to consider what might happen if we have to evade military checkpoints and patrols in the near future, even going off-grid if necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They aren't going to stop now. They're betting billions on technology that limits human interaction. Look at the companies experiencing booms in market investments. Big money has been trending toward tools of the authoritarian surveillance state and the "convenience" industries. They're planning on people staying home for the foreseeable future and if that's the case, the masks certainly won't be coming off anytime soon.</p>

        <p>I do, I've been doing this since the beginning. Been kicked out of a place twice. The second time I was kicked out the dude wasn't even wearing a mask himself he was wearing a baclava that covered his mouth as much as a thong covers a porn stars ass. He and two other people told me to go buy a mask and come back. I refused. It was for my job too. Told my job I won't go back unless they allow me to shop without a mask. My job went out of business not long after but not because of me. I went into Home Depot working with my cousin and brother. Both of them were wearing a mask I didn't, no one said a thing and this is in Austin Tx where they're pretty militant about compliance. I'm guessing employees are tired and just don't even bother since most everyone complies. Pussies...all of them. I'm so tired of this shit I wish more people were like us....</p>

        <p>I wear a bandana around my face when I walk in then let it slip below my face. Been doing that for months now with the plan of malicious compliance if anyone confronts me, meaning I'll put the bandana over my nose then let it down again when they look away. But so far no one has said anything to me. I do the same thing at the gym and notice others start to emulate me when they see me breaking the rules. I can't believe I'm living in a world where I have to pretend to put a bandana on my face because people think it will stop an airborne virus, it's unreal.</p>

        <p>I don't have the guts to not wear one in a store. I just started getting the courage to only wear a mask only when I absolutely have to. Previously, I would wear one outside in crowded areas since 90% of people in my town do and will give you death glares if you are not wearing one. It was very freeing walking around my downtown area without a mask today. I did get some dirty looks and people walking into the street to avoid passing too close to me but that is expected of the sheep in my area. The mask culture is huge where I live so I would probably be arrested on the spot for shopping in a store without a mask.</p>

        <p>Agreed, it's a slippery slope and must be resisted before things get worse. The government has already taken away so many "human rights" - freedom of movement, freedom of speech, access to medical care, access to food for some (those imprisoned in their homes) etc. It's just getting worse.</p>
<p>As for my personal standpoint: I've only worn a mask once (at the doctor's office - would not be allowed to see them without one). I am lucky to live in a location with very loose mask restrictions, but if a mandate were passed, I would wear the mask - I would die in jail, I have a chronic condition and would basically suffer a long, painful death without the medications, equipment and routine I have at home. That's the reason I'm reluctant to protest or break any laws. I'm not afraid of death (if I passed peacefully in my sleep, I'd say, "thank god it's over") but I am afraid of suffering.</p>

        <p>I refuse to wear a mask in shops, and my experience is just like yours: most of the time no one says a single thing, and in fact, lately, I sense that more and more people actually view me with <em>respect</em>. Having the balls to stand out shows confidence, and people dig that, dudes and chicks alike. Strangely, this whole thing has been a confidence booster for me...</p>
<p>What blows my mind is all the young people -- the teenagers -- that basically put up no resistance to the pseudo-scientific quackery of mask mandates (unless you call wearing a mask below your nose "resistance"). I thought teenagers were supposed to be a bunch of rebellious punks and troublemakers with a natural-born hatred of authority. That they've been so docile and passive through all of this really confirms how emasculated and chemically lobotomized people have become. What happened to the fiery spirit of civil disobedience embodied by the flower children of yore? Even Bernie Sanders, who so many young Americans support(ed), led a sit-in back in 1962. We should be organizing similar demonstrations right now; large groups of naked-faced people peacefully shopping and likewise occupying public spaces as a way of saying, "Hey, remember 2019? Remember normal life? This is what normal life looks like." That normal human behavior has become a radical act in 2020 is unbelievable, but it's true. And I don't see any real solution other than mass non-compliance, on the double. </p>
<p>Governments don't take people's freedoms, and they don't give them back. It's We the People that collectively choose to either relinquish our freedoms, or reclaim them through direct action, NOT through voting or participation in a fundamentally illegitimate political system. The lessons of the 20th century should be crystal clear and fresh in everyone's minds; there can be no excuse for sleepwalking into the same old booby traps of fascism and communism, especially when the victims' corpses are still rotting in their mass graves.</p>
<p>If Americans (and Europeans, etc.) would simply give civil disobedience the old college try, then I'm sure they'd get a real sweet tooth for it, as it's quite the adrenaline rush. If people can do the "ice bucket challenge" all over social media, then I'm sure we can get 'em to do the "face-streaking challenge" where they go out in public with a -- gasp! -- totally naked face. At this point, the individual risk is incredibly low, but the longer we procrastinate and sleepwalk towards the enemy's trap, then the worse our waking nightmare is going to be.</p>

        <p>This is world war 3, the fight for your freedoms and mind. We are the soldiers at the front of the battalion that are taking all the hits until things can hopefully even out.

        <p>That's precisely the attitude we need. People need to be prepared to die for this shit, it's not a fucking joke anymore. I'd rather die with honour as a free human being than live life as a soulless transhuman slave in a technocratic dystopia. Life is short regardless, and people who think they can somehow avoid fate by passively accepting this are in for a rude awakening; the grim reaper comes for <em>everybody</em>. Don't fear the reaper. Every man dies, but not every man truly lives. What we do in life echoes in eternity. So grow some balls like your ancestors, fight, and die with honour. Huzzah!</p>

        <p>I will never, ever back down on this. Haven't done it once since this whole thing started and I never will. No one gets to tell me what to do with my own damn body just to do everyday tasks like going places. I refuse believe that I'm dangerous just because I won't cover my face, which is totally crazy, on so many levels. Like, they seriously think I'm a mass murderer if I don't and if I do then everything's fine, like what the crap? I never thought people would be so stupid as to do it of their own free will, let alone try to force people, but I will never give up. This isn't to say I haven't had problems with idiots, but too bad, this is too important. It helps I guess that I'm a college-aged girl so people might not want to be confrontational with me since it could be deemed as "sexist." Speaking of my age and gender, I'm surrounded by idiots since all the other girls my age except a few are all about this new normal crap. Anyway, I will never back down for this, not for anything. I guess another thing that might help is my age and gender. Lots of people expect the ones against this to be old men with scruffy beards, not young women. I guess it shows them that not all 18-year-old girls agree with them. Anyway, I don't care what happens to me. I couldn't live with myself if I ever became compliant, even in desperation because I'd be betraying myself. I recommend Peggy Hall, she's really educated on this and can help you fight for your rights so you never have to comply.</p>

        <p>To those that never wear one, how do you get away with it? There's only a handful of places I can go and not wear one and not have anyone say anything to me, but pretty much every store I go won't let you in or will give you one if you don't have one. Being in the heart of a city, damn near all small and big stores alike enforce the mask rule. Family Dollar is my safe haven though because they couldn't care less. Even some of the staff don't wear them lol</p>
<p>I imagine you could probably get away without wearing one if you take it off after you go in, but my anxiety prevents me from doing that as I don't really want any confrontation.</p>

Since when does the government have the right to tell me i cant shit wherever i want. I think ill stop wearing clothes entirely as well.

        <p>Oh you want facts? Edit: We're usually associated with right wing extremist lunatics but whatever.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8">New England Journal of Medicine</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</em></p>
<p>This statement near the end of this same article isn't very scientific wouldn't you say?</p>
<p>"<em>It is also clear that masks serve symbolic roles. Masks are not only tools,</em> <strong><em>they are also talismans</em></strong> <em>that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals.</em> <strong><em>Although such reactions may not be strictly logical,</em></strong> <em>we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis."</em></p>
<p>Additional studies confirming the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>A randomized controlled trial by the<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744"> University of Michigan-School of Public Health</a> found hand washing reduced influenza-like illnesses; while mask wearing made no difference whatsoever.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-12-26">German randomized controlled trial</a> found “there was no statistically significant effect” when it came to wearing masks “on secondary infections.”</li>
<li>A 2010 randomized study in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/4/491/861190">The Journal of Infectious Diseases </a>found that neither “face mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of influenza-like illnesses cumulatively.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x">randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand</a> during the H1N1 pandemic found “Influenza transmission was not reduced by interventions to promote hand washing and face mask use.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003335491012500206">19-month randomized controlled trial</a> of crowded urban households found a significant reduction in upper respiratory infection through educational interventions; but no reduction when adding hand sanitizers or masks.</li>
<li>A randomized controlled trial of people sleeping together in tents during an Islamic pilgrimage was reported in <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/125489/article">Infectious Disorders</a>. Researchers found no difference in laboratory confirmed influenza cases among those wearing masks and those who were not. </li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013998">randomized trial in France</a> found that mask wearing only produced a 0.4% reduction in secondary infection and “did not identify any trend in the results suggesting effectiveness of facemasks.”</li>

        <p>No one finds your hyperbolic responses or satire funny. Instead of doubling down and pretending to be stupid, you should move on with grace - especially since the current literature blew you the fuck out. This is very embarrassing for you.</p>

        <p>I’m so sick of this. It’s as if millions of people have committed to doing their very best to be aggressively toxic and hostile all of the time, on every subject. </p>
<p>Clearly you have some strong feelings. That’s fine. But if you’re not interested in civilized discussion, there’s truly no point interacting with others - although I do admire your commitment to your trolling. Perhaps one day you’ll have the same commitment to being a decent, mature human.</p>

        <p>I am not being toxic i am being real. We must avoid this new normal at all cost. We must even take back our old normal. It seems weird and toxic to you but only because you have not had a full realization. YOU are living the new normal. You have conformed to using toilets and wearing clothes. Thats how it happens, without people even realizing. Do you think out ancestors wanted to shit indoors?! NO! They were forced to by the fascists and the ANTIFA and the communists.</p>

        <p>You're stupid enough to mistake me for a troll, so perhaps you over estimate yourself, friend. Please don't insult my beliefs by dismissing me as a troll, simply because we don't see eye to eye. You may shit indoors if you want. That's no issue with me, the issue is when you try to dictate where i am allowed to shit. I mean we do live in the land of the free, and i am brave enough to shit outside so why should i be held back from it if i am doing so responsibly?</p>

        <p>Dude your shit obsession is something else. </p>
<p>I hope you are a troll because otherwise it’s sad. I am on your side. I hate masks with a curse and am so upset at all this. But by comparing not being muzzled up to shitting on the street you’re doing everyone here a great disservice, tarnishing as irrational and angry. </p>
<p>But we are on your side here, seriously. Just trying to make our point without resorting to hyperbole, which is what they hypochondriac covid freaks have been doing. </p>
<p>I think there’s been a misunderstanding due to the fact that your hyperbole sounds like you’re mocking our points. I concede that I didn’t notice, you might do well to concede that you expressed yourself in a weird, ambiguous way that was easily misunderstood.</p>

        <p>Oh so you like to promote introducing public bio hazards to the public? Like shitting on the street. I will point out that I doubt you would shit in the street even if it weren't frowned upon since like 98% of people want privacy when doing so but that 2% are either mentally disturbed or a drug addict. I'll let you tell me which one you are since I'm not one to judge.</p>
<p>Sarcasm aside you do know that hospitals treat used mask as bio hazards? So all you people wearing mask and then littering the earth with those same masks are guilty of something that's could be classified as a war crime if you were in charge of a country.</p>
<p>Of course no one would be stupid enough to put someone who displays your level of intellect in charge of an entire nation....Oh wait,  never mind bad example.</p>

        <p>Don't you dare compare my intellect level to that of our GLORIOUS President Trump, rightful winner of the 2020 election and gracious loser if he HAD lost. Incase you didn't know masks aren't a biohazard if they are infected with covid, because a HOAX cant infect people. As for shitting outside our ancestors did it for THOUSANDS of years, hello, wake up! They conformed to shitting indoors (disgusting) and now look at us. Everyone has a shit room in their own house, we must take back our #oldnormal of shitting wherever we like.</p>
