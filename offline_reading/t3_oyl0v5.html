    <p><p>If the vaccinated start</p>
<ul>
<li>succumbing to diseases that are normally non-fatal</li>
<li>becoming sterile</li>
<li>suffering miscarriages</li>
<li>becoming more susceptible to mental illness</li>

        <p>It's a list of <em>possible</em> side effects. That means in anyone who's had a vaccine recently and develops one of these disorders, it gets added to the list. That is different from <em>recognised</em> side effects, i.e. adverse reactions which have been proven to be related to the vaccine. That list is much smaller (from your list, it's VTE, thrombocytopaenia, DIC, allergic reactions, arthralgia, and myocarditis). And in that list, the <em>incidence</em> of those reactions (outside of the generic side effects of fever, body pains etc.) is incredibly low.</p>
<p>The list I put together for Covid are all <em>recognised</em> and happen at significant rates. The incidence of thrombosis in Covid is greater than the risk of all of the vaccine side effects put together. </p>
<p>Also, pretty much everything in your list has also been attributed to Covid. Most of them theoretically develop from a generalised inflammatory state - which is naturally a lot greater in a proper infection compared to a vaccination reaction, so it's only common sense that Covid is more likely to cause them than the vaccine.</p>

        <p>generalised inflammatory state is some completely nondescript term. I think its more likely the spike protein is the mechanism for action in the clotting because it will bind to the ACE2 receptors in your blood vessels, heart, etc. Injecting something that induces 40 billion spike protein is a scary thought. This list is from October 22, 2020. Unlikely they saw someone with all of these possible side effects including stroke and did not disclose it after the clinical trial. That would be a medical ethics violation. Good chance the fda agrees with my assessment that the spike protein is actually the mechanism for action in these side effects. They would have had a hard time guessing about 
thrombocytopenia without understanding the mechanism of action. Spike protein attacks bone marrow. Bone marrow creates platelets.   Thrombocytopenia Is a blood clot with low platelets. Thrombocytopenia is exactly what would be expected if the spike is attacking bone marrow</p>

        <p>Thrombocytopaenia/VITT is a side effect specific to this vaccine, yes, but most of the other side effects in your list (myocarditis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barre etc) are inflammatory - they have been seen with other vaccines which is probably why they’re in this list if there were 1 or 2 case reports of encephalitis or something post-vaccine. It is a nondescript term because they’re fairly nondescript disorders, caused by the immune system attacking inappropriate targets during an inflammatory response. That’s my point - if it’s true for vaccines it’s even more true for Covid since the immune response is much larger.</p>
<p>As for VITT the actual incidence is very low, again massively outweighed by covid-related thrombotic disorders.</p>

        <p>So you induce a modified protein in humans for the first time. The Japanese government’s pharmacokinetics study showed the lipid nanoparticle with mrna inside is being distributed throughout the body and binding to ACE2 receptors all over once converted into spike. This is your “inflammatory response” but i think a more accurate term is cytokine storm. The spike protein is being induced in many different types of cells.</p>

        <p>I'm a practising doctor, so I'm well aware of that. However in medicine we do not deal in consent but <em>informed</em> consent. If someone is making what I consider to be an unwise medical decision while in full possession of the facts I completely respect that. If they are doing so under the influence of incorrect assumptions and misinformation then I have an obligation to correct them first. What they do after that point is their decision.</p>

        <p>You sound like a fair, reasonable, and responsible doctor. So how do you feel about government stepping in and coercing or forcing people to make personal medical decisions, despite their beliefs?</p>

        <p>I'd be uncomfortable with blanket vaccine mandates. I agree with vaccine mandates in healthcare staff though, because it has precedents - e.g. here in the UK a complete personal vaccination record was a prerequisite for employment in the NHS even before covid, and because I agree that the duty of care and the right of patients to a safe environment outweighs the right to refuse vaccination. </p>
<p>There are other less obvious examples, e.g. we are obliged to work long night shifts which have been proven to be harmful to both physical and mental health, we are exposed to various infectious diseases and occupational hazards etc., it's all part of the job. </p>
<p>I also accept that circumstances are different during a pandemic. Just like during WW2 there were severe restrictions on civil liberties and political freedom, e.g. censorship, rationing, curfews, which probably boosted the UK's chances in the war and were acceptable because they were temporary. Trust me, if the additional powers and restrictions used by governments in free countries during the pandemic persisted after covid you can expect most people to join your side on this issue. But while it's ongoing most people accept it as a necessary measure.</p>

        <p>Seems like we’re mostly on the same page. Vaccine requirements are and have been a normal thing for certain fields of work, intl. travel, military, etc., for a long time, and for good reason. However, I don’t know of any such requirements for anything that was still seeking fda approval. To say that it is 100% safe is no different than saying that it is 100% unsafe. Everyone reacts to everything differently. ~8 months of trials is not enough time for solid long term data on a drug, just as ~18 months is not enough time for solid long term data on a disease.</p>
<p>I believe I caught the virus early on, and recovered fine. I understand some aren’t so lucky. Whether the virus was natural, man-made, or flat out doesn’t exist, is irrelevant at this point, in my opinion. I believe the numbers have been presented to us in a way to manufacture a “pandemic”. </p>
<p>The amount of government overreach, the transfer of wealth and profiteering by big corporations and pharmaceutical companies, and the political/social/cultural division is FAR more concerning than an illness with such a low fatality rate, even with the numbers we’re presented with.</p>
<p>But, I’m just a stupid American welder, what do I know. I’m not here to name-call or change anyone’s mind. Thanks for the civil discussion.</p>

        <p>No, they reduce the risk. Exercise and healthy eating doesn't prevent you from getting heart disease. Not smoking doesn't prevent you from getting lung cancer. Alcohol abstinence doesn't prevent you from getting cirrhosis. But they all reduce the risk.</p>

        <p>No, it allegedly reduces the risk. Hypothetically, let’s say it does, though. </p>
<p>That would mean that vaccinated people are protected from serious harm and the unvaccinated people are only affecting themselves. So leave us the fuck alone.</p>

        <p>The only unvaccinated person you can speak for is yourself. And you were the one who replied to me. So if you want me to leave you alone then don’t reply to my comments. You just engaged ME in conversation and then immediately told me to leave you alone, that’s pretty weird behaviour</p>
