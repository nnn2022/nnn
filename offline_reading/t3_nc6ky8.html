    <strong>The real agenda of the CDC and the government</strong>
    <p><p>No we did not win last night with the recent announcement of vaccinated people are no longer required to wear masks. In fact we are heading in the wrong direction with this news.</p>
<p>What the announcement did was bring back the "vaccine passport" argument. Everywhere people will question how we could ever know someone is vaccinated or not. The people who are vaccinated can try to tell the stores all they want their vaccinated, but UNLESS SHOWN PROOF they must be treated like unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>Now vaccinated people will become angry. So angry that the vaccine passport that people were so against before will now start to gain favor. Simply because vaccinated people will claim they need a way for themselves to live their lives without restrictions and make those unvaccinated suffer. </p>
<p>We were winning the fight before with a lot of people on our side against the idea of a passport. Now with the recent announcement it's become a harder fight.</p></p>

        <p>Yup you nailed the psychological intent of these guidelines. Have the people beg for more tyranny to trade one restriction for another.</p>

        <p>I thought it was interesting that right before the new guidance was released, the CDC also indicated that they would no longer be collecting data on most vaccine breakthrough cases. Just seems like odd and convenient timing?</p>

        <p>I already described it here, and on an identical thread on Lockdown Critical Left. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nc5kcy/cdc_playing_3d_chess/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nc5kcy/cdc_playing_3d_chess/</a></p>
<p>The CDC knew that, with freaking Gavin Newsom soon to drop his mask mandate, every state in the country would drop their mask mandates (for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people) no later than July 4.</p>
<p>The CDC changed its guidance in order to ensure that mask mandates would remain in place for unvaccinated people.</p>

        <p>Think about how difficult this would be to enforce. Would it be a person at the door of the grocery store like at costco? It would take forever to just to get in the door. </p>
<p>The CDC is not tracking individually vaccinated people, they only track how many vaccines were administered and how many were spoiled. No one is relaying individual vaccine info back to them. All they have is that little piece of card stock, which is easy to fake. They’re done, and they know it. The politicians started looking bad (not that they ever looked good), they’ve got a big election coming in 2022, and the regulatory agencies looked like buffoons trying to push a vaccine while still requiring vaccinated people to mask up. </p>
<p>Now the mask nazis have a choice, show they are vaccinated by shedding the mask, or keep it on and signaled they haven’t had the jab.</p>

        <p>Sadly, this is not at all difficult to enforce. Even third world countries that have 20x the population density as the average city in the USA have been doing this for months.</p>

        <p>Every step they take you come up with a new conspiracy of why they do it. </p>
<p>They are lifting the restrictions alredy in numerous forms. Ever thought about it being not a secret agenda?</p>
