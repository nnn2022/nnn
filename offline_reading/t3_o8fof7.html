    <strong>I can hear the virus!</strong>
    <p><p>Does anybody else see the real virus that's infected society, better yet, can you hear it? Being that of ideas alone. Mere idea's absent of any genuine personal thought or reflection; just reiterations of what someone else had said (hear say). People are told that people are dying left and right and many, under virtue of misguided compassion, take hold and accept it as finite truth. Completely unwilling or incapable of seeing the world in a bigger picture from their already divisive mind because their mind has already been made. People in the last few years have been politically isolated and pushed to pick a side thus we have the current political instability. The moment covid was announced it quickly became political cannon fodder. People in power are seen doing things that contradict what they've said; furthering the narrative and divisive nature of it by creating talking points (that can't be discussed). Thus we see the difference between those willing to question the world entirely or by merely accepting all they're told as finite truth. This is why we have so much censorship around the virus. Because this is more than just a measly flu, it's a war on the very reason wars start to begin with. Language itself.</p>
<p>Ideas are all that separate people from one another. Whether one is better than another due to his/her differing circumstances is just an idea that's accepted by the collective. We're in a dark time of human history when we've been set free to believe what we want. It's now blatantly obvious that malevolence guised as compassion is the tool of those incapable of any genuine thought or the ability to have tangible arguments. Hence why I said this goes far beyond just a biological virus. The virus is the ideas that separate people from one another like programs in the mind. Hence why we see so much racial division as portrayed and aired on media and why people instinctively weaponize their world view. If you beg to question the ideas they've been told to believe and accept without question, you're the enemy for daring them to stand up for it. I'm really not sure where it all leads but I can say for certain, it isn't pretty. Best one can do for him/herself is not to become reactive to those looking for one.</p>
<p>Given this writing, I'm strictly referring to what I've seen and experienced in American society that can also share similarities to other developed countries. Comfort being the reason I see how divided and unstable we've all become. Then you have our ability to discuss important topics tarnished because people were never taught to have civil discussions. It's either you're compassionate by being submissive to ideas or that you're the enemy to be ridden. Part of what's also effected our collective ability to discuss important topics is social media and the digital age itself. Though it's not the purpose of this, it's effected everything from work life, family life to interpersonal relationships. Because it's changed how we communicate to other human beings and share our experiences. For the most part, everything has been created as a kind of distraction. Things that have no greater purpose in life or the improvement of it. Because there's no shortage of people suffering in the battle of ideas. Our comfort has done something, it's made us susceptible to idealizations and romanticizations of reality itself.</p>
<p>Oversimplified understandings of humanity while closing off the minds of many by making the truly advantageous endeavors boring or difficult so people don't see the true value to such simple things in life. To dissuade it's society from reading or thinking too much into life as to give one more insight into how the world and people work as a whole (like a machine). I see this in America as we're programed that we live in the greatest country, taking the education system for granted; hiding it's ills when it does nothing to advance a civilization. It lacks the cultivation of ones own unique thought process and instills people with a one way to life mentality. The reason I bring up education is because I've notice a kind of social bottleneck that's been formed. Where our ability to communicate to one another has diminished. People then never look any further than what life demands of them to which they remain relatively predictable and controlled. Through motives that are disingenuous and taken from the collectives views just for the sake of not being the outsider. Thinkers in the world now are exactly the opposite, the nails that stick out. </p>
<p>At this point, I'm having a difficult time believing people are actually driven by fear. Of course it started out that way but now I believe people just like to be held as heroes and praised for things that have no merit. We've escaped the initial fear stage of covid and are now in the attack on conversations themselves. Because people haven't a clue as to how deep the programming of their beliefs go or that they're part of a bigger picture. If they resort to violence because of idea's they'd heard online, they're only taking part in what's being planned. Forming a 2 sided nation, one against the other, so they become soldiers without really seeing it. Especially in a time when mere words told to someone can cause them harm. Lesson the such a person would be for them to realize why it causes them pain and why they'd attributed so much meaning to the spoken phrase itself to cause them more stress than that's ever needed. Because ideas have become weaponized and people have become the pawns.</p>
<p>Life is so much better when not immersed into the toxicity of the modern day but I'd be playing the "ignorance is bliss card"Â if I was to just piss off and let the world destroy itself buy the very reasons people find it necessary to deem what's right to them as nearest to a kind of dogmatism. Stigmatizations of "sensitive" topics is what's hindered our ability to understand ourselves in the grand scheme of the world. The sooner we forget our stigmas, the sooner we can understand the truth of ourselves as human beings. With this comes our ability to speak up as a collective rather than shouting incoherent babble at issues designed to be distractions from real societal issues. We've got to look beyond what can and cannot be discussed in the public so that we can cultivate personal thought from those that don't believe they can do so. Through bypassing the reactive nature of certain subjects by causing one to think for themselves.</p>
<p>Problem with that is, more often than not, thinking about ones environment is rather painful and depressing. I'd dealt with it for many years and had only just become free of the suffering of which I didn't know was occurring or why. Because I felt like the person society wanted me to become. To be deemed a looser because I wasn't handed the simple ticket to life. A painful gift as I'd learned a lot in the 28 years of being lost and trying to understand the world as a whole. Never thought I'd get to such a point and requiring a near-death experience to really understand the beauty of life beyond the beauty we're told to admire. The beauty of the serendipitous and coincidental rather than focusing ones time on all the negatives people put forth. Try to be a positive light when all we're surrounded with the the negatives. It's not fun but, to see the world become a better place for the humans of the future, we must stop being distracted and voice our concerns.</p>
<p>To which I'd realized, given the realization that words can transfer pleasure, pain and thought, voices are powerful. More so than my typed words as theirs no identity to them. The identity you've correlated this to is what your mind has perceived of me. Not the truth in the least which hopefully reveals just how fallible language has become. A lot of what I have to say after what I'd learned is easily misconstrued. My inability to have in depth discussions limits my ability to better articulate what I'm trying to say. I do my damnedest.</p></p>

        <p>It was good stuff. But it was a little bit all over the place. Its hard to discuss 50 different ideas at once. Thus being incoherent. I'm not trying to put you down. I commented on the OP to encourage you to keep writing.</p>
