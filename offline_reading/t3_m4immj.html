        <p>I absolutely applaud her commentary. She is an inspiration to others, and a lesson in what it means to have courage enough to stand in the face of adversity. Factual, in the true spirit of science. Any other doctor that cannot distinguish faith in politics from skepticism in science, ought to be ignored completely .</p>

        <p>Like in all of my videos in this project, I use this crazy thing which is the footage of one of my donkeys with the influencer "crown", just to make fun of all this craze in social media and the way information and influence rolls nowadays, that's the main motto of the whole project. Then, some of the songs are more joke-like and some others with more meaningful/deep message, like this one. Is not meant to be funny at the whole, but trying to keep this relaxed fun-meme-joke vibe always to balance the load of the lyrics... Hahaha, I think I never explained this so in detail before, hope it makes sense. Cheers bro!</p>

        <p>I think you are under-rated. The line about the shit was the line that made me laugh. I assume English is not your first language. I recommend that you realise you have a selling point if you make it satirical. You paid for an advert! That's legendary. Make more üôÉ</p>

        <p>Thanks for your words man! Yes I am a Catalan born dude, trying not to be too clumsy in english, hahaha. It's unreal that you saw an advert of it, I did very little with pocket money, but trying my best to break the ice of the webs, not easy with this kind of subjects AT ALL. And yes I advocate to keep the satirical point, it's a fundamental part of it. Salut! :)</p>

        <p>From September 2020? the comments made in this video (beginning of March 2021) very clearly address the attempt that fact checkers have made to discredit her, if you notice the title and the 'added flair'.
I however have read this AFP fact check you linked. 
I found it says absolutely NOTHING substantial, it is misleading itself. It makes anecdotal counter claims using logic that does not work.
I will provide examples:
It first begins with an attempt to refute an earlier video that went viral, using footage of MP Stannford warning of making the vaccine mandatory or compulsory by law. It makes the bleek argument the viral video of the statement was misleadingly edited: this is FALSE or misleading itself - because - whether or not the statements included making it mandatory/compulsory thing for people <em>returning to NZ</em> - it is essentially MADE MANDATORY through limiting the freedoms of those who do not have it. 
Arguing that it is misleading because it is edited, is stupid because it implies its spliced in such a way as to distort the message, the message has not changed though. We look at policies implemented further than just New Zealand, with regard to vaccine certificates and the benefits that bring with them.
I would argue it is misleading suggest that <em>they meant</em> "anyone who doesn't get a vaccine gets locked up" which was never the point proposed in the first place!</p>
<p>That's just the first bit</p>
<p>&rt;Does the Covid-19 PCR test for genetic material¬†‚Äòwe don‚Äôt know the significance of‚Äô?</p>
<p>The article says they have an email from so and so, saying the opposite, that it "tests for genetic material" from the <em>yet to be isolated and sequenced</em> genetic material. This is purely anecdotal. It was a perfect opportunity for the "fact checker" to include a study or two showing the methodologies of which. They did not do this. More refuting on he said she said basis. The basis of the claims regarding PCR tests are echoed by the inventor of the PCR test himself. I'm not sure exactly how else it can be explained, the PCR test should not have been used as the "gold standard" to collect data for this pandemic. It is flawed and highly dependent in the way in which its used (leading to potential for it to be misused) . It is not an objective test.
It is to detect <em>genetic material</em> from <em>coronavirus(s)</em> (a family of similar viruses) not even the specific identifying spike protein of the variant in questions.
In short, the test requires a high degree of interpretation with various settings and does NOT indicate a person's infected status. This is demonstrated fact now in March '21</p>
<p>&rt;Comparing the Covid-19 PCR test used in New Zealand to the ‚Äògold standard‚Äô test</p>
<p>Again. Perfect opportunity to provide evidence, instead anecdotal "emails" sent to AFP were used. Bollocks.</p>
<p>Finally I will end it at the end of the article : it attempts to hilariously refute her point regarding the rate of testing and the climb in cases (again, demonstrable) by making the comparison between her and trump. As if the person reading will fall for the Fallacy and associate the two from henceforth without even a decent explanation. I was never a supporter of trump, this witchcraft in wordplay pushes me to speculate maybe I should have been. There is no room in science for political points, the fact they tried is indicative of their stance <em>as a whole</em></p>
<p>Oh but I'm not done. I would really like to hear any arguments against this please, I'm open to discussion also.</p>
<p>(sorry for caps)
WE MUST BE EQUIPPED WITH ENOUGH KNOWHOW AND INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS WITHOUT FACT CHECKERS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY EXPOSED AS WORD BENDING MACHINES, DEPENDING ON FAILING AND FALLIBLE LOGIC ARGUMENTS. </p>
<p>that being said. Please might I ask, what other information in those outdated fact checkers do you believe Dr Baileys DIDN'T ADDRESS DIRECTLY, in the video above? Dated March 2021. </p>
<p>I would be more than happy to view any evidence, including ad hominems, Strawman fact checkers if you so wish. </p>
<p>Edit coming soon, typed in a single go, apologies for typos if any, just woke up</p>

        <p>üòáüôè  Thank you, I will point out I have gone through the posters comment history with a fine tooth comb and replied to most. I found his arguments are on the side of reason at least, for however misguided his conclusions, I believe its vital to remain civil with those who are open to reason (it is my naive hope we can reach these individuals and truly change their mind) </p>
