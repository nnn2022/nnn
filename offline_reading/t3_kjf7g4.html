        <p>Yep. Mask are a tool for mental conditioning. Remember it was 15 days. We’re getting close to a year. These pricks don’t want this “pandemic” to end. It’s about control man. I’m insulted too.</p>

        <p>They always say how unselfish they are, but they are doing what feels good in the moment; What won't get them in trouble. They are hauling themselves to the back of the bus instead if being like Rosa Parks and taking a stand to make an imprint into the future. I always hear them say they are on the right side of history, but if I look back,  I can't think of anyone who was on the right side of history who complied with authority so they wouldn't rock the boat.</p>

        <p>Absolutely do agree with you and it's a form of submission and compliance, in my mind I think of it as "let's see what we can have them do to get away with next" and it's taking freedoms away one by one honestly, also let's also keep in mind that breathing in one's germs via the mask is not all that hygienic and sanitary</p>

        <p>Petri dish is an apt metaphor.</p>
<p>I am getting so sick of all the idiots calling it a face-diaper. Such an analogy means your mouth is akin to an asshole. Which legitimizes their claims and undermines the the dissenting opinion.</p>

        <p>I first thought masks do no harm and its not about suffocating to my knowledge, but</p>
<p>every time I wear it for longer my breath gets really nasty like I did not brushed my teeth. And I did. So it clearly increases bad bacterie in your airways. hm!</p>

        <p>It is absurd to deny that face diapers collect and breed bacteria, collect dead cells, and collect virus particles. It is not common knowledge, but bacteria and dead cells are express buses for viruses. Add that to the fact you are breathing in this pathogen soup over and over. Face diapers are not only INCREASING the spread of viruses, they are MULTIPLYING the spread of bacteria. When they say someone died of complications of covid, they usually mean BACTERIAL pneumonia. What better source of BACTERIA than a face diaper. After face diaper mandates were implemented, cases SKYROCKETED, but through some twisted lawyer/politician logic, that was an excuse for more mandates. A face diaper is mandated self harm.

        <p>Yep, there was a covid outbreak at my work. Every single person who got it were full time mask wearers, even alone. the few people who didn't get it were ones who only wore the mask for show when the supervisor was around.</p>
