        <p>(I contemplated uploading this because I'm not good at explaining things in words, but here it goes. And apologies for the picture format.)</p>
<p>This comic is written by Joe Nobody, who was put in the Elan School. Basically other children and adults humiliated and verbally abused you unlike nothing in the world, and you got very little of anything. </p>
<p>The paragraphs in the two images struck me because it applies to what we're going through right now.</p>
<p>At the Elan School, you can work your way up to become the people that bully the lower rank people. That's just like now, these people who are power tripping and enforcing masks are feeling powerful for being able to bully people into wearing masks. </p>
<p>And now that most people forgot what freedom is like, they're easily moldable to whatever the bad guys see fit. </p>
<p>All this fear-instilling has made many people emotionally manipulatable, and here we are. </p>
<p>Higher ups are enjoying being mask free (because they know it doesnt work and are doing it for shows), while "ordinary people" continue to suffer and get bullied into masks, lockdowns, and eventually vaccines. (I called the vaccine passports rolling out last June. People thought I was crazy, yet here we are)</p>
<p>The mass are just like the kids who were in the Elan school. Getting bullied, humiliated, getting everything stripped away, yet when the higher ups give them a glimmer of hope ("just 2 weeks!", "opened at 25% capacity!" "Get vaccinated to go back to normal!"), it seems like the best thing ever, and they continue to follow orders. </p>
<p>I just hope enough of us puts up a fight, because if we don't, our humanity is going to be stripped away from us until there's none of it left.</p>

        <p>I know what elan is. Thereâ€™s definite similarities between that sort of business and what is going on now.</p>
