    <strong>Hatred is so toxic</strong>
    <p><p>It's fairly obvious at this point, that to SOME degree, this whole thing has been political. As far as I'm concerned, even if it's only 1% politically driven, that's too much.</p>
<p>I thought I knew what hate was, I really did. I've been dragged through some pretty crappy situations where I've been forced to see people at their absolute worst.</p>
<p>But I just cannot comprehend how much hatred people must have had for Trump that they'd be willing to allow millions of people to suffer because of that hatred.</p>
<p>I do feel genuinely sad for all of those in political power who hold that kind of hate, and the millions of citizens who have the same sentiment. They must truly be very sad people. Just mind boggling really</p></p>

        <p>Can't believe someone downvoted you. I upvoted you but at the moment it's just back to 1 upvote.  That action is the exact reason why I wrote this post in the first place, so thank you to whoever the dipstick was for doing that, you proved my point even more clearly than the original post. Spiteful sad people</p>

        <p>As an impartial observer, it makes me wonder if the left is even capable of self-reflection.  The last two Presidents they've managed to field have won based not on their policies, but on what they <em>weren't</em>.  Obama wasn't (entirely) white, so to not support him was decried as racist.  Biden wasn't Trump, so to not support him got you branded as a MAGA CHUD.</p>
<p>If you build your identity around what you <em>aren't</em>, then what <em>are</em> you?</p>
