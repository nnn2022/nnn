    <strong>Here is the one thing that should never exempt you from wearing a mask</strong>
    <p><p>First of all, I'm a smoker. I know, not very healthy, criticise away ðŸ˜† Secondly, I don't believe masks are anything more than virtue signalling pieces of useless cloth. If they do work, the effect that mask mandates have on death tolls and COVID related suffering is negligible.</p>
<p>Now that that's out of the way, let me tell you what should never exempt you from mask wearing, under mask wearing mandates: smoking. This is coming from a smoker who enjoys a cigarette when he's out, walking his dog.</p>
<p>However, in my country (I live in the capital city, one of the most populous cities in Europe: Bucharest), if you are smoking on the street, the fact that you are not wearing a mask is acceptable (I believe this is because they don't want to strip the smoker of his freedom to smoke... lol). So deeply inhaling and then exhaling and blowing smoke while creating a big, white, virus cloud around you without a mask is perfectly fine, but not wearing a mask while breathing normally is a punishable offense.</p>
<p>This is just another example of the stupidity and hipocrisy of covid related measures.</p></p>

        <p>Good point. I also thought smokers were less susceptible to covid.</p>

        <p>l live in Romania too but not in Bucharest and not a smoker except for maybe an ocassional one at a party but not more than a pack a month,don't smoke everyday or even every week. But l have a pack on me at all times and l just hold one in my hand if l'm walking and l'm gonna be questioned by the police. Mostly l use the bike and don't wear one at all. But l agree it's very stupid.</p>
