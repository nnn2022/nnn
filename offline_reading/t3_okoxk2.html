        <p>When I got the Anthrax shots (6 shots 2 weeks between iirc), I remember just feeling hot afterwards.</p>
<p>But anthrax is actually deadly and the corpsmen told me the vaccine was kinda experimental. </p>
<p>This new gene therapy for a chest cold BS is way different.</p>

        <p>Not different. Read “Vaccine-A” by Gary Matsumoto. And it’s not about Anthrax being deadly it was about the fact that the threat was never real...the only anthrax attack we got originated from Ft Detrick and was weaponized within the US from amongst our own.  The anthrax shot was just as dangerous as C-19 because they were/are both experimental...anthrax caused destruction because of the adjuvant “squalene” amongst other things. FDA never approved anthrax either and after enough soldiers died or were maimed it was pulled from the market. It did come back though in the mid-2000’s but with no squalene...it still caused life altering adverse reactions though even after it was “approved”. I was supposed to get a series of six and after I dead that book I was able to stop at 1. I’ve been in for 18 years now...</p>
