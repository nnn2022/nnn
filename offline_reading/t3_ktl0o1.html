    <strong>This whole pandemic feels like a global scam</strong>
    <p><p>You know how scammers call people and try to get their money by scaring them with lies? They'll say anything to cause an initial wave of fear in you so you comply even if it makes no sense. Ex: "This is the IRS and we'll arrest you if you don't send x amount of money", "Your house will be foreclosed if you don't buy Target gift cards and send them to me". Just complete nonsense that gullible people will fall for. It reminds me of the weird rules politicians create that have nothing to do with covid. We can all be packed in Walmart like sardines, but we can't go inside a small business because covid cases are always skyrocketing. A new mutation of covid is coming, so we have to stay inside for another year. We're literally murdering grandmas by trying to have a social life. It's just strange that everyone goes along with these things even though there's no logic. I hope the initial fear of this "deadly virus" wears off and people see this whole pandemic for what it really is, a scam.</p></p>

        <p>I'm with you 100%, but I've lost hope that people will wake up and see this scam for what it is.  We're almost a year in and lots of people are still pushing for harder lockdowns and mask mandates.  Anytime you point out the contradictions and use actual science and data to make your case, you are branded a conspiracy theorist.  I really don't know how we get out of this bullshit because they always come up with one thing after another to keep the scam going.  It's never ending.</p>

        <p>I think part of the problem is that people take the mainstream media too seriously. If CNN says there's a deadly virus, then it must be true. If just one major news outlet would stop fearmongering, more people would be open to logic and reason. I'm curious to see how long people will comply, I hope it's not forever.</p>

        <p>Exactly, the media is whipping up mass hysteria 24/7 and keeping this thing going.  If it weren't for the media, we would have been done with this long ago.  I swear, if the media came out and said this "pandemic" was over, people would go right back to living life normally, no questions asked.  It's sad that too many people rely on the media for info and refuse to do their own research.</p>
<p>I really hope that people will stop complying because it's getting extremely difficult to handle this situation.  I can't take it anymore and have been doing pretty badly mentally recently.</p>

        <p>If there was no sinister plot, the reasonable move would be to stop testing of asymptotics and let the "cases" go down as more and more people of the high risk group get vaccinated.</p>
<p>They could still sell us the vaccine, pass security bills and celebrate their heroic efforts while ripping us off and blaming the unavoidable recession on the virus.</p>
<p>But to the contrary, they discover new "deadly" strains all the time and find reasons why the vaccination doesn't end lockdown.</p>
<p>They do not want this to end.</p>

<p>I completely agree. Shit keeps getting MORE insane literally every day. If there were any hope that there was no dark master plan, at least SOMETHING would be getting better. But nope, it’s just getting worse. I had some hope before Christmas, but it’s gone now. I’m just focusing on my family and I refuse to engage in or enable any discussion with anyone about this shit now. </p>
<p>I’m actually even considering getting off reddit and de-smart phoning.</p>

        <p>I actually think this is the next move.  I think they will tell people to only get tested if they have symptoms and not when exposed.  The CDC sort of already did this when they reduced the quarantining time and said you don't need to get tested just quarantine.  In fact, a few of my friends were exposed to covid this past month and they were told to ONLY take a test if they exhibited symptoms.  So it's coming</p>

        <p>But people are still told to quarantine for two weeks. I should know, I was told if I test positive on my Covid test (that I must take soon to get a medical procedure done...yay me...) then I must quarantine for two weeks still. Doesn't seem like they've budged on the magical "two weeks of quarantine" rule.</p>

        <p>I’ve lost hope too. All over the US and Canada, the same tyrants who ordered businesses to close, people to stop working &amp; stay home, schools to close, and so on, continue to get caught blatantly violating their own mandates and the doing the very NORMAL things they continually shame everyone else for doing and people still aren’t waking up. If seeing the health experts, governors, mayors, etc violating the rules time and time again doesn’t wake up the masses, nothing will!</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right and it's unfortunate that when people watch the fearmongering of the MSM they are so consumed by it they lose their critical skills that is to wake up to the facts that the testing isn't being used for the right purpose, there are so many false positives (up to 90%) and it's what is driving the lockdowns...

        <p>This is the quintessential formula in a tyrant's handbook: instil such fear into the population that they'll willingly surrender their rights, you don't even have to take it from them. </p>
<p>Mask mandates where I live locally were 80% redundant, as there was such fear propagated (over 30 cases in the state and 0 deaths!!!) that 80% of people voluntarily were wearing masks everywhere a couple days before the mandate.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Fear makes people ignore their rationality/critical thinking skills, and do whatever the person is asking of them in order to make it stop. "If I don't wear a mask, people will die? Okay, I'll wear one 24/7!"</p>

        <p>I work in a hospital. We are only doing emergent surgeries because our recovery room is being used as overflow. Every day our emergency room is packed. The pandemic feels like a nightmare I can't wake up from, not a scam. Meanwhile the uneducated masses think their Facebook research qualifies them to have objections to real science. </p>
<p>We will never get back to normal if people continue to go out with no regard for other people. We will never go back to normal if we don't put on our big boy pants and do the right things to prevent the spread of disease.</p>

        <p>Sorry but its flu season.  This happens every year. Also thanks to the media spreading fear, everyone goes to the ER anytime they get a cough. </p>
<p>I work in a hospital too and I watched a guy walk into the ER and lost off his symptoms as if he was reading them off the CDC’s website.  The problem is that there was nothing wrong with him. He was not showing any symptoms and was speaking in a calm clear voice.  I’m not saying that’s everyone, but if it wasn’t for the fear porn, people would just stay home and deal with their symptoms.</p>

        <p>I check in every now and again. This isn't my life. I agree that I don't want covid rules forever but I'm aware of the fact that we're only going to get back to normal by preventing the spread of covid. </p>
<p>I'm not here to call anyone an idiot, but if you feel that way maybe it's time to reanalyze your ideas because maybe you're projecting. </p>
<p>Instead of complaining about restrictions during a pandemic and coming up with conspiracy theories, we should focus on reducing the spread and getting people vaccinated. Once the virus is gone we can get on with our lives. </p>
<p>If we continue to carelessly spread covid, we'll never get back to normal. In fact, the new normal will be our friends and family dying in a crowded hospital, alone as everyone gets infected and reinfected until the rest of us get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Covid is gone.  The tests are pumping out over 90% false positives.  Almost every single covid "case" is someone who isn't sick- he or she just "popped positive".  So even if the test is accurate, if having covid just means you have covid and aren't sick, well that's pretty far from being a deadly virus!  </p>
<p>If the tests really are over 90% false positives, well, that means that no one has covid and all these covid cases are just people getting phone calls by labs TELLING them they have covid when they really don't!</p>
<p>It's flu season and the TV is telling us that flu has been cured because everyone has covid instead?  And you believe that crap?  I guess you can't wake people up.  People are going to believe the lies.  </p>
<p>And I work in a hospital.  I've worked in a hospital for years.  There was NO difference in my hospital from previous years and there's no difference in any hospital from previous years.  The virus is GONE.   And people have been watching family members die of disease for thousands of years.   And influenza has been killing people for the last century.  Yet only NOW you care because the media made you afraid of covid.</p>

        <p>Do you have sources for any of that information? I also find it really impressive that your hospital hasn't had any impact by covid. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days">CDC</a> has reported almost 4k new deaths just  today. So much for gone. Unfortunately, the only thing gone is another nearly 4 thousand American lives. I'm willing to bet there will be another few thousand tomorrow too.</p>

        <p>the constant fear mongering in the uk tells us that the hospitals are at breaking point and people believe every word of it but every time I've been to the hospital it's been calm. </p>
<p>why would they arrest a woman for filming in a quiet hospital? it would be reasonable to arrest her for filming dying patients or something but she was just filming to show how quiet it was. why would the authorities want to hide such a thing?</p>

        <p>Unauthorized filming in a hospital is a potential invasion of privacy. If I had to guess, that person was being arrested for trespassing after being asked not to record video there. </p>
<p>Hospitals are quiet because there is no visitation allowed and not every department is taking patients. The hospital I work in is sending everyone home that they reasonably can. </p>
<p>Besides, what do you expect? Parking lots and hallways stacked to the ceiling with people on ventilators or struggling to breathe? The patients are all in rooms.</p>

        <p>Here's the thing though. When I say something without a source to back out up (or even with one), somehow I'm the asshole who is "too far gone". I don't get the benefit of someone asking me where I've gotten my information and then changing their mind when they're presented with evidence based facts. I get called idiot, a lying troll, a libtard cuck, and many other things because instead of debating facts with supporting evidence, people are more concerned about the side they've chosen. </p>
<p>So I simply find it really hard to accept things being said that differ from the things I've seen from credible sources and I don't think it's too hard to ask for evidence supporting viewpoints opposing my own. If what you're saying is correct, I should have seen it from the credible sources I already have or you could enlighten me with something I may have missed. Maybe I don't know exactly what to search for and you do. And that's okay. </p>
<p>And sure, it's fair to say you don't want to take the time to provide a source for what you believe. You don't owe me anything. But it does make it at least a little irresponsible to spread an opinion that could be potentially damaging if people go along with it without checking first if it's based on reality. </p>
<p>I recognize you have the right to say whatever you want, and again, you don't owe me anything. Plenty of people will just blindly agree with you because it's something they want to believe is true, but that's not me. So I find I am unable to accept what you're saying as you've failed to support your position with any evidence. </p>
<p>Sorry for the rant. It's really frustrating that we all want to get back to normal but nobody wants to acknowledge that we need to deal with the situation before we can do so. Everybody here just seems to want to pretend it's a global hoax and share ill-conceived conspiracy theories that are accepted with no basis in reality... and I'm ranting again.</p>
<p>Have a good life dude. Hope everything goes well for you.</p>

        <p>&rt; But it does make it at least a little irresponsible to spread an opinion that could be potentially damaging if people go along with it without checking first if it's based on reality.</p>
<p>I had a feeling you'd reply and I thought you'd say something like this. I feel like the mainstream media are spreading dangerous information and this vaccine is potentially very dangerous but because the news and the politicians say it's safe, you believe it's safe right? I don't believe the msm or the politicians. That's where we differ. I dont mind discussing a topic with a reasonable person, which you seem to be. I've just had enough of people calling me a grandma killer or uncaring or whatever. Some people enjoy debating online. I don't. I wasn't trying to be rude.</p>
<p>tbh, I dont even know what you want proof of anymore. I think it was just a link I saw on twitter. I unfollowed all those people 2 days ago because I'm sick to death to hearing about it all. I just dont want to hear about this virus anymore. I've given up on the news. I subscribe here but I'm spending less and less time here because it starts to make me ill if I focus on anything negative for too long.
The main point is, the people in this sub seem to be able to see something which the rest of you can't. There's just no point trying to convince you of it because if you can't see how wrong this whole covid story is by now, then you probably never will.</p>

        <p>I guess all I can say at this point is live your best life. </p>
<p>For what it's worth (and I know it's not much) I have gotten my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and the only negative side effect I've had is a sore shoulder where it was injected. I felt it was safe to get, not because of politicians or media, but because doctors and scientists said it was safe and the hospital I work for said it was safe. </p>
<p>I don't have anything I'm willing to share to prove I got the vaccine as it has my personal info on it and anyone can just make things up on the internet. I don't recommend you take this as definitive proof that it's safe, just one data point from an unreliable source from your perspective. </p>
<p>I don't know what you'll do with that info, but as I said, just live your best life.</p>

        <p>Plenty of doctors and scientists have said that it's not safe too but you probably won't have seen them because google, YouTube, Facebook etc have been banning anyone who doesn't tow the line. I'm happy for you if you're happy. But I won't be getting any vaccines until a good amount of time has passed and I can see for myself what the results have been.</p>

        <p>Okay, come on. You can't claim stuff like that without sources. Not to mention that Google, youtube, and Facebook aren't credible sources. Them taking down misinformation isn't them towing the line, it's removing harmful content. The real fear mongering is from those telling you to be scared of something you don't understand without any proof to back it up.</p>

        <p>Yeah you too, pal. Enjoy the conspiracies. If you ever find any actual evidence to support any of you claims, let me know. </p>

        <p>You could have it and not know it and by the time you find out you could have given to half your family and several people in your community. It can take days to develop symptoms and even then, you could just be asymptomatic. Do your research some place other than your cecum. </p>

        <p>I've hung out with 100's of unmasked nomadic strangers since this whole thing started and no doubt they've been hanging out with 1000's of others. But I still dont know anyone who's had it. Maybe because we're healthier and more positive than the average Joe. I'm not scared of this virus. I've had really bad flus and food poisonings and a stomach parasite, which basically took me to the brink of death through starvation. I prefer to live my life on my terms and I will never consent to being told what to do by a bunch of twats in suits, who are profiting from this so called 'crisis'</p>
