    <strong>Great tribulation support groups</strong>
    <p><p>As we approach the great tribulation and the mark of the beast is rolled out. Soon, those without the mark will not be allowed to shop for food or other essential items (Revelation 13:17).</p>
<p>I was wondering if we shouldn't begin forming support groups to help each other with food, shelter and other items we will need to grow in our backyards.</p>
<p>We have to do that before they take our our internet away and of course, before they start decapitating us (Rev 20:4).</p>

<p>Revelation 13:17 -  so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. </p>
<p>Revelation 13:17 - And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and <em>I saw</em> the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received <em>his</em> mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</p></p>

        <p>The only thing that's going to work when that goes down is in person communication. Maybe shortwave radio.</p>

        <p>That's why we need to create this network now. It seems it's already too late in Israel and the UK is going down the same path.</p>

        <p>I agree it’s very important to make a support group with all the censorship going on. I think it would be better to use a private server. Where’s a good place to make one?</p>

        <p>Don't know. I think I'll reach out to my neighbors. But we won't be able to fight against it. The objective is to stay alive and support our families until Jesus returns. He said He will abbreviate those days for love of us.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Mark 13:20 - If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.</p>
