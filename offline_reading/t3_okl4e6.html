    <strong>META THREAD for all concrete evidence related to the New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>As many of you can probably tell, things are starting to get crazy and at an increasingly rapid pace. Depending on where you live, this new global tyranny may even be drastically affecting your entire life and threatening your existence.</p>
<p>I’m starting to become desperate for a pool of evidence to help wake people up as if their life depends on it. Every single day, I think to myself that it’s the day the public consciousness will be startled awake, but it’s just not happening. So this is what I propose, for the sake of helping our fellow man around us.</p>
<p>I will create categories such as vaccine dangers, lockdowns, food shortages, etc.  and under each one, please <em>in this order</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Write a short submission statement explaining your source.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Provide a link with solid evidence that has credibility which would hold up to the average doomer.</strong></p>
<p>Mods, a pin on this post might help. Seeing a mountain of evidence in this sub might startle the living shit out of the doomers.</p>
<p>This community is amazing. I’m so thankful for you all, and I hope our collective knowledge can make a difference in the world.</p></p>

        <p>From your second source:</p>
<p>“The CHMP is of the view that non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity.”</p>
<p>“However, there were no mRNA-1273-related effects on female fertility, embryo-foetal or post-natal survival, growth or development in the F1 offspring”</p>
<p>And your third source:</p>
<p>“Pregnant women remain in a small group of people who the vaccine has not been fully verified to be safe for.</p>
<p>While pregnant women are eligible for COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., they are not professionally recommended to take it or not, as there is little data on the vaccines effects on pregnant women.”</p>
<p>Your fourth “source” is some fucking lady talking on Twitter</p>
<p>Your fifth is the same as your third</p>
<p>And your sixth says this:</p>
<p>We want to make sure we explore it as fully as we can to just bring comfort to people and hopefully encourage them and help them understand that this is not a side effect to be afraid of, this is something that might be uncomfortable but it’s not a reason to, potentially maybe in some really extreme conditions, it is not a reason not to get the vaccine,”</p>
<p>You literally linked 6 sources that go against your claims you fucking chimp</p>

        <p>check the biodistribution graph. it shows that the mrna collects in the ovaries.</p>
<p>The next conclusion is common sense. If we're exposing the cells in the ovaries to the mrna and the lipid nanoparticles, there are potential reproductive effects. An obvious precursor is changes in menstrual cycles, which apparently weren't detected in clinical trials.</p>

        <p>The burden is on you to back up your claim that there is "scientific evidence of reproductive damage" (the "Greater Claim").  You tried and are already down to a single one of your six ~~gish gallops~~ links, and you're already back down from "scientific evidence of reproductive damage" to a "risk" that babies' genes could be modified (the "Lesser Claim").</p>
<p>This Lesser Claim is based on (I think, since you didn't really describe much) samples from a lab rat showing that there is some concentration in the ovaries as part of a look at concentration in (all? most? some?) organs.  From that, you seem to be (again, you've done a shit job explaining yourself) positing that level of concentration backs up your Lesser Claim of an unknown and unquantified "risk" for unexplained reasons.  Does that about sum it up?</p>
<p>I think you're about 1/3 of the way to establishing your Lesser Claim.  You'll have to show what levels of concentration provide risk, that the same sorts of risks present in humans (and at what levels), and that the levels of concentration are able to affect the egg/zygote/embryo/fetus/baby and at what frequency (there's no such thing as literally zero risk in just about anything, much less medicine).</p>
<p>Best of luck with your Lesser Claim!  Should be easy for someone with an IQ above that of 9,999/10,000 people such as yourself.</p>

        <p>The article just says until there is more research they don’t recommend the vaccine for pregnant women because it can be bad. But that’s literally what the trials also mentioned in the article are for… there is nothing that says it will harm women or reproductive systems it just says there is a possibility.</p>

        <p>For someone with a supposed 160 IQ, so seem to have an aversion to actually typing anything yourself and instead just spam links.  Anyway, your link has an "expert," Jennifer Margulis with an... interesting history (<a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jennifer_Margulis">https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jennifer_Margulis</a>), saying that there's risk because there have not been long-term studies.  The article notes a retrospective study of 35,000 pregnant women (although, to be fair, a single "expert" (not going to bother to look him up, it's not my claim) calls into question that study).  </p>
<p>So, at most, you have provided a link with an opinion from a "I'm not a vaccine denier I'm just asking questions" type of expert that basically says "there's no evidence that they're safe."  That's so far off from your Greater Claim of "scientific evidence of reproductive damage" that I'm surprised you even bothered, but at least it's some backup to your Lesser Claim of some (still unknown) level of risk of... something.</p>
<p>Way to be humble.  You reached for the stars - "scientific evidence of reproductive damage" - but tacitly admitted you were stuck on the ground.</p>

        <p>Yea, ideally, but this is a new development so there  haven’t been too many on this yet. A vaccine with a spike protein is kind of a pseudo virus in a way though, so certainly raises some concerns to be investigated further</p>

        <p>“The COVID-19 vaccines are immunologically effective and can—according to the publications—prevent infections, morbidity, and mortality associated with SARS-CoV2; however, they incur costs. Apart from the economic costs, there are comparatively high rates of side effects and fatalities. The current figure is around four fatalities per 100,000 vaccinations, as documented by the most thorough European documentation system, the Dutch side effects register (lareb.nl). This tallies well with a recently conducted analysis of the U.S. vaccine adverse reactions reporting system, which found 3.4 fatalities per 100,000 vaccinations, mostly with the Comirnaty (Pfizer) and Moderna vaccines [12].
Is this a few or many? This is difficult to say, and the answer is dependent on one’s view of how severe the pandemic is and whether the common assumption that there is hardly any innate immunological defense or cross-reactional immunity is true. Some argue that we can assume cross-reactivity of antibodies to conventional coronaviruses in 30–50% of the population [13,14,15,16]. This might explain why children and younger people are rarely afflicted by SARS-CoV2 [17,18,19]. An innate immune reaction is difficult to gauge. Thus, low seroprevalence figures [20,21,22] may not only reflect a lack of herd immunity, but also a mix of undetected cross-reactivity of antibodies to other coronaviruses, as well as clearing of infection by innate immunity.
However, one should consider the simple legal fact that a death associated with a vaccination is different in kind and legal status from a death suffered as a consequence of an incidental infection.”</p>

        <p>That article was retracted. Unfortunately, they are misreading the data. The data they used is valid, however, they did not accurately interpret the data.</p>
<p>“The journal retracts the article, The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations—We Should Rethink the Policy [1], cited above.
Serious concerns were brought to the attention of the publisher regarding misinterpretation of data, leading to incorrect and distorted conclusions.
The article was evaluated by the Editor-in-Chief with the support of several Editorial Board Members. They found that the article contained several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings.
These include, but are not limited to:
The data from the Lareb report (https://www.lareb.nl/coronameldingen) in The Netherlands were used to calculate the number of severe and fatal side effects per 100,000 vaccinations. Unfortunately, in the manuscript by Harald Walach et al. these data were incorrectly interpreted which led to erroneous conclusions. The data was presented as being causally related to adverse events by the authors. This is inaccurate. In The Netherlands, healthcare professionals and patients are invited to report suspicions of adverse events that may be associated with vaccination. For this type of reporting a causal relation between the event and the vaccine is not needed, therefore a reported event that occurred after vaccination is not necessarily attributable to vaccination. Thus, reporting of a death following vaccination does not imply that this is a vaccine-related event. There are several other inaccuracies in the paper by Harald Walach et al. one of which is that fatal cases were certified by medical specialists. It should be known that even this false claim does not imply causation, which the authors imply. Further, the authors have called the events ‘effects’ and ‘reactions’ when this is not established, and until causality is established they are ‘events’ that may or may not be caused by exposure to a vaccine. It does not matter what statistics one may apply, this is incorrect and misleading.
The authors were asked to respond to the claims, but were not able to do so satisfactorily. The authors were notified of the retraction and did not agree.”</p>

<p>This is a testimonial from Dr. Peter McCullough, who testified to the Texas State Senate HHS Committee. This is a video of his testimony on the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons' Professional YouTube Channel. He has over 500 citations in the National Library of Medicine and over 1000 publications in Peer-Reviewed medical journals. He is internationally recognized for his credentials on cardiology. Given the current situation people under 30 are experiencing with myocarditis, I'd say his input is extremely valid during this time.</p>

        <p>I honestly am not trying to attack you, but I see a few potential problems with your sources that I feel should be pointed out so we are accurately backing up our arguments. I believe in double/triple checking sources, studies, research, etc., I hope this doesn’t come across as offensive..</p>
<p>Your first article - The source for your first article is solid and the article itself is substantive enough, however, the article is from December, 2020. The vaccines were still very new and testing/research was extremely limited. The concerns were very relevant back then since no one knew what would happen, but since that time we’ve seen millions more get the vaccine and the majority of those concerns have thankfully not turned into reality. I feel the data and opinions in the article are too out of date to take into consideration at this point in time.</p>
<p>Your second source - It’s about myocarditis which is indeed something of concern. However, I think it should be noted that a tiny fraction of vaccinated individuals will experience it and looks to be temporary/easy to recover from. Not to downplay it but the statistics I think are important to note, it happens but it’s extremely rare and even more rare for it to be seriously life threatening.</p>
<p>Your third source - It’s about manipulative magnetic nanomedicine which is a medical technology for delivering vaccines. The article is theoretical and does not discuss any dangers with current vaccines. The technology is very complex and, unfortunately, that one article alone doesn’t tell us enough about it to have an opinion. If anyone is interested in this, please do extensive research on what this technology is before you form an opinion on it. I don’t know nearly enough another it myself to feel one way or another, but there is a ton of info about it that we should all read before we make our minds up.</p>
<p>Your fourth article - The source is heavily anti-vaccine, they are extremely biased. If we truly want to know the reality of this situation, we have to put our biases aside and omit biased sources from our research. We wouldn’t accept an article arguing for vaccines that was written by Pfizer or J&amp;J, so it seems a little hypocritical to accept an article arguing against vaccines from an anti-vaccine publication. Hopefully we can all agree on this logic.</p>
<p>Your fourth article - It is detailing how the coronavirus itself is even more harmful than we thought. Which could very well be true, but that seems to contradict your other articles/views. This article is essentially arguing that the fears and concerns about the virus are valid, which again could be true but I’m not sure if that is what you intended to get across.</p>
<p>Your fifth article - Someone else posted this article from a different publication. It was redacted due to numerous errors in the way the authors interpreted data. They are painting a picture that does not exist. Anyone could interpret data like the authors did and draw any conclusion they want, it’s quite easy to completely misread data to make it back up your biases/preconceived notions. Sadly, this article should be considered harmful misinformation. I wish that wasn’t the case but if we want to see the reality of the situation we’re living in, we have to be extremely objective and we have to question ourselves to not let our own biases blur reality.</p>
<p>I haven’t reviewed the YouTube video yet but I’ll take a look and let you know what I think. Thanks for the info and again, hopefully you don’t take this the wrong way. I’m just trying to help us all be more accurate and informed ☺️</p>

“Will covid-19 vaccines save lives? Current trials aren’t designed to tell us”<br>
“None of the trials currently under way are designed to detect a reduction in any serious outcome such as hospital admissions, use of intensive care, or deaths. Nor are the vaccines being studied to determine whether they can interrupt transmission of the virus.”<br>

<p><strong>The International Journal of Clinical Practice:</strong><br>
“COVID‐19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID‐19 disease via antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID‐19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials.”<br>
“The risk of ADE in Covid-19 vaccines is non-theoretical and compelling”<br>
“Clinical trials of vaccine candidates have only been designed around immunogenicity as an efficacy end point and have not been designed to capture exposure of subjects to circulating virus after vaccination, which is when ADE/immunopathology is designed to occur. Thus, the absence of ADE evidence in COVID‐19 vaccine data so far does not absolve investigators from disclosing the risk of enhanced disease to vaccine trial participants, and it remains a realistic, non‐theoretical risk to the subjects.”<br>

“Antibody-based drugs and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are being expedited through preclinical and clinical development. Data from the study of SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Previous respiratory syncytial virus and dengue virus vaccine studies revealed human clinical safety risks related to ADE, resulting in failed vaccine trials”<br>
“For non-macrophage tropic respiratory viruses such as RSV and measles, non-neutralizing antibodies have been shown to induce ADE and ERD by forming immune complexes that deposit into airway tissues and activate cytokine and complement pathways, resulting in inflammation, airway obstruction and, in severe cases, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. These prior observations of ADE with RSV and measles have many similarities to known COVID-19 clinical presentations.”<br>

"At present, there are no known clinical findings, immunological assays or biomarkers that can differentiate any severe viral infection from immune-enhanced disease, whether by measuring antibodies, T cells or intrinsic host responses."<br>
"Animal models for the evaluation of human polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) should be judged with caution because FcRs that are engaged by IgGs are species-specific as is complement activation. Antibodies can have very different properties in animals that are not predictive of those in the human host, because the effector functions of antibodies are altered by species-specific interactions between the antibody and immune cells. In addition, the pathogenesis of a model virus strain in animals does not fully reflect human infection because most viruses are highly species-specific. These differences may falsely support either protective or immunopathological effects of vaccines and antibodies."<br>

“Exogenous mRNA is inherently immunostimulatory, as it is recognized by a variety of cell surface, endosomal and cytosolic innate immune receptors. Depending on the therapeutic application, this feature of mRNA could be beneficial or detrimental. It is potentially advantageous for vaccination because in some cases it may provide adjuvant activity to drive dendritic cell (DC) maturation and thus elicit robust T and B cell immune responses. However, innate immune sensing of mRNA has also been associated with the inhibition of antigen expression and may negatively affect the immune response.”<br>
“Potential safety concerns that are likely to be evaluated in future preclinical and clinical studies include local and systemic inflammation, the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components.<br>
“A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity.”<br>
“Another potential safety issue could derive from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination. Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to oedema. Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus [blood clot] formation”<br>

“Besides the mechanism of molecular mimicry, mRNA vaccines may give rise to a cascade of immunological events eventually leading to the aberrant activation of the innate and acquired immune system.”<br>
“Importantly, the up-regulation of these immunological pathways is widely considered to be at the basis of several immune-mediated diseases, especially in genetically predisposed subjects who have an impaired clearance of nucleic acids.”<br>
“Until proven otherwise, the administration of a nucleic acid vaccine may instead put these individuals at risk of unwanted immunological side effects by either sensitizing the PRRs or generating cross-reactive cell clones and antibodies. Moreover, COVID-19 mRNA vaccine might differently stimulate myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), generating an unbalance in the downstream cytokine pathways that play a crucial role in autoimmunity and auto-inflammation”<br>

“Concentrations of mRNA-1647 were quantifiable in the majority of tissues examined at the first time point collected (2 hours post-dose) and peak concentrations were reached between 2- and 24-hours post-dose in tissues with exposures above that of plasma. Besides injection site [muscle] and lymph nodes [proximal and distal], increased mRNA concentrations (compared to plasma levels) were found in the spleen and eye. Both tissues were examined in the frame of the toxicological studies conducted with mRNA-1273 final vaccine formulation. Low levels of mRNA could be detected in all examined tissues except the kidney. This included heart, lung, testis and also brain tissues, indicating that the mRNA/LNP platform crossed the blood/brain barrier, although to very low levels (2-4% of the plasma level). Liver distribution of mRNA-1647 is also evident in this study, consistent with the literature reports that liver is a common target organ of LNPs.”<br>

<p><strong>The Lancet Journal:</strong> 10% of trial participants of mRNA rabies vaccine experienced grade 3 adverse event within 7 days of vaccination. Grade 3 adverse event is one grade away from ‘life-threatening,’ and defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as “severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling”<br>

        <p>Journal of Epidemiology:<br>
“Epidemic theory dictates that a reduction in the force of infection by a pathogen is associated with an increase in the average age at which individuals are exposed. For those pathogens that cause more severe disease among hosts of an older age, interventions that limit transmission can paradoxically increase the burden of disease in a population.”<br>
“The link between limiting pathogen exposure and improving public health is not always so straightforward. Reducing the risk that each member of a community will be exposed to a pathogen has the attendant effect of increasing the average age at which infections occur. For pathogens that inflict greater morbidity at older ages, interventions that reduce but do not eliminate exposure can paradoxically increase the number of cases of severe disease by shifting the burden of infection toward older individuals.”<br>

“A Bayesian inverse problem approach applied to UK data on COVID-19 deaths and the disease duration distribution suggests that infections were in decline before full UK lockdown”<br>

<p>Journal of Behavioural Economics for Policy:<br>
“The response to COVID-19 has been overwhelmingly to lockdown much the world’s economies in order to minimize death rates as well as the immediate negative effects of COVID-19. I argue that such policy is too often de-contextualized as it ignores policy externalities, assumes death rate calculations are appropriately accurate and, and as well, assumes focusing on direct Covid-19 effects to maximize human welfare is appropriate. As a result of this approach current policy can be misdirected and with highly negative effects on human welfare. Moreover, such policies can inadvertently result in not minimizing death rates (incorporating externalities) at all, especially in the long run.”<br>

“Higher Covid death rates are observed in the [25/65°] latitude and in the [−35/−125°] longitude ranges. The national criteria most associated with death rate are life expectancy and its slowdown, public health context (metabolic and non-communicable diseases (NCD) burden vs. infectious diseases prevalence), economy (growth national product, financial support), and environment (temperature, ultra-violet index). Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be linked with death rate. Countries that already experienced a stagnation or regression of life expectancy, with high income and NCD rates, had the highest price to pay. This burden was not alleviated by more stringent public decisions. Inherent factors have predetermined the Covid-19 mortality: understanding them may improve prevention strategies by increasing population resilience through better physical fitness and immunity.”<br>

“Our objective was to assess the association between staying at home (%) and the reduction/increase in the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in several regions in the world…. After preprocessing the data, 87 regions around the world were included, yielding 3741 pairwise comparisons for linear regression analysis. Only 63 (1.6%) comparisons were significant. With our results, we were not able to explain if COVID-19 mortality is reduced by staying at home in \~ 98% of the comparisons after epidemiological weeks 9 to 34…. We were not able to explain the variation of deaths/million in different regions in the world by social isolation, herein analyzed as differences in staying at home, compared to baseline.”<br>

“Implementing any NPIs was associated with significant reductions in case growth in 9 out of 10 study countries, including South Korea and Sweden that implemented only lrNPIs [lr = less restrictive] (Spain had a non‐significant effect). After subtracting the epidemic and lrNPI effects, we find no clear, significant beneficial effect of mrNPIs [mr = more restrictive] on case growth in any country.”<br>

“Biomedical evidence from the early months of the pandemic suggests that lockdowns were associated with a reduced viral reproductive rate, but that less restrictive measures also had a similar effect. Lockdowns are associated with reduced mortality in epidemiological modelling studies but not in studies based on empirical data from the Covid-19 pandemic. Psychological research supports the proposition that lengthy lockdowns may exacerbate stressors such as social isolation and unemployment that have been shown to be strong predictors of falling ill if exposed to a respiratory virus. Studies at the economic level of analysis points to the possibility that deaths associated with economic harms or underfunding of other health issues may outweigh the deaths that lockdowns save, and that the extremely high financial cost of lockdowns may have negative implications for overall population health in terms of diminished resources for treating other conditions.”<br>

<p>University of Regensburg Preprint: <br>
“Official data from Germany’s RKI agency suggest strongly that the spread of the coronavirus in Germany receded autonomously, before any interventions became effective. Several reasons for such an autonomous decline have been suggested. One is that differences in host susceptibility and behavior can result in herd immunity at a relatively low prevalence level. Accounting for individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to the coronavirus yields a maximum of 17% to 20% of the population that needs to be infected to reach herd immunity, an estimate that is empirically supported by the cohort of the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Another reason is that seasonality may also play an important role in dissipation.”<br>

“This phenomenological study assesses the impacts of full lockdown strategies applied in Italy, France, Spain and United Kingdom, on the slowdown of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Comparing the trajectory of the epidemic before and after the lockdown, we find no evidence of any discontinuity in the growth rate, doubling time, and reproduction number trends. Extrapolating pre-lockdown growth rate trends, we provide estimates of the death toll in the absence of any lockdown policies, and show that these strategies might not have saved any life in western Europe. We also show that neighboring countries applying less restrictive social distancing measures (as opposed to police-enforced home containment) experience a very similar time evolution of the epidemic.”<br>

<p>Simon Fraser University Study:<br>
“An examination of over 80 Covid-19 studies reveals that many relied on assumptions that were false, and which tended to over-estimate the benefits and under- estimate the costs of lockdown. As a result, most of the early cost/benefit studies arrived at conclusions that were refuted later by data, and which rendered their cost/benefit findings incorrect. Research done over the past six months has shown that lockdowns have had, at best, a marginal effect on the number of Covid-19 deaths. Generally speaking, the ineffectiveness of lockdown stems from voluntary changes in behavior. Lockdown jurisdictions were not able to prevent non- compliance, and non-lockdown jurisdictions benefited from voluntary changes in behavior that mimicked lockdowns. The limited effectiveness of lockdowns ex- plains why, after one year, the unconditional cumulative deaths per million, and the pattern of daily deaths per million, is not negatively correlated with the stringency of lockdown across countries. Using a cost/benefit method proposed by Professor Bryan Caplan, and using two extreme assumptions of lockdown effectiveness, the cost/benefit ratio of lockdowns in Canada, in terms of life-years saved, is between 3.6–282. That is, it is possible that lockdown will go down as one of the greatest peacetime policy failures in Canada’s history.”<br>

“Over 20 indicators of lockdown were tested to identify their effects on the rate of growth of infections (or deaths). In less than ten percent of the cases, the lockdowns had a positive effect.

“Consistent with observations that imposition and lifting of lockdown has not been observed to effect the rate of decay of the country reproduction rates significantly, our analysis suggests there is no basis for expecting lockdown stringency to be an explanatory variable.”<br>
“In this regard we note that, for lockdowns to be expected to “flatten the curve” significantly enough to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, the impact on the response variable in 5.2 would have to be significant. We will investigate a sensible threshold, but our sense is that a correlation of less than 50% would be wholly inadequate.”<br>

“A systematic review has shown that a 14% increase in TB incidence can occur per one unit decrease in body mass index (BMI), across the BMI range of 18.5-30 kg/m2.

This may result in an increase in estimated (uncertainty interval) incident TB by 185 610 (180 230, 190 990) cases. A 59% reduction in TB case detection between end March and May 2020, may result in an estimated (uncertainty interval) additional 87 711 (59 998, 120 630) TB deaths [19.5% increase (14.5, 24.7)] in 2020.”<br>

        <p>To be fair, people should probably find more professors backing what Montagnier says. For the last decade, he's been pushing a new theory (on electromagnetic signals from DNA) that bears a lot of similarity to basic homeopathic methods, even though no other research lab has successfully replicated his studies.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I knew it was over after the Repo shenanigans back in 2019. This set me on a miraculous journey that eventually led here. The system was dead in 2008 and now they are turning off the life support.</p>

<p>Fed begins intervention in repo markets (Repo market = repurchase agreements between banks. A form of money laundering and covert quantitative easing and manipulation of the money supply.) This is widely believed to be the be the beginning of the Fed's implementation of BlackRock's "Going Direct" reset... Although an emergency would still be needed to justify further actions -- and emergency situation that conveniently reveals itself in 2020.</p>

<p>And it's true. MMT is just a cult of fake markets, no solution. The reality of our situation is that the economy went from real to only existing on a credit card to being a collection of infinite debt that must be reset in one way or another.</p>

        <p>Repo market is basically a market for cash where banks that want cash (A) (borrower) go to other banks that don't want to hold cash (B) (lenders) and give them security (typically treasures) in exchange for cash, to hold. Bank B gets compensated with yield in exchange for lending cash to bank A. Bank A can then get (repossess) their security back from bank B when they return the cash (rather buy back the treasury). This system froze up because lenders did not want to lend and everyone was hoarding cash. Around the same time Feds started tapering their bond buying program, just a little bit. Yields went up, equity markets crashed. Feds then started buying bonds, thus suppressing yields, again, which started pumping the markets again. Covid gave them a great excuse to pump ever more liquidity into the markets.</p>

        <p>This is correct. But it's all intentional. None of this benefits you or most investors so it seems like they're losing control. But the central banks (private companies) and hedge funds are in the process of buying literally everything they can. Especially houses, farmland, and other tangible assets.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the sentiment a lot of ordinary people had with GME but you can only fight this system by leaving it behind. You see, pumping GME meant a loss to one hedge fund but a gain to another. The moment you obey their rules and use their money, they already won.</p>
<p>Market makers have created this wall street casino and the house will win, until we leave it. The Crypto market has viable options for leaving it that are worth investing in.</p>

        <p>How do you purchase crypto? I own some. And I have only ever purchased it with USD being as that I live in the US. I am curious how you think that multiplying my dollars would be a bad move. I could increase my crypto positions exponentially. And it’s a very calculated play as shorts have not closed their positions. Yes the house always wins long term but they don’t win every bet. And they are losing their ass on this play.</p>

<p>Real inflation month on month is 10% or more these days. It is a better move to get out of cash and either get into natural resources or other means of production.</p>
<p>Mining Crypto is a good idea. I bought most of my portfolio on the exchanges, though. I was into precious metals for the past 10 years but the gold price is still being fixed and manipulated even now. Crypto is probably more viable overall as a store of value and means of exchange.</p>
<p>Even when then grid goes down, it will have to be back up for the agenda to advance so I'm not too worried about that.</p>
<p>Dollars seem like a huge liability to me these days. I do not really care to count in them anymore. Receiving payments in fiat currency always makes me anxious to trade it for better assets.</p>

        <p>All the GPU’s are scalped and crazy prices now. So you prefer to hold even your highly liquid assets in crypto opposed to cash? I agree with a lot of what you are putting down but I think that holding GME is solid as they are quickly becoming THE premier online game/tech/collector/esport hangout, retailer, partner. The segment is growing rapidly and they have a dedicated customer/fan base. If dollars are not worth shit your shares of GME will be. They will pay you in crypto if necessary. As long as the internet is working GameStop is a gold mine. And shares let you own a portion of that. Plus shorts have not closed their positions. It’s a blank check.</p>

        <p>Institutional investment firms, who normally only sell ETFs and mutual funds, are buying RESIDENTIAL HOMES, at an alarming pace. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they need to turn liquid assets into tangible assets to preserve capital. </p>
<p>When the dollar goes to shit, people still need homes. If you own homes, you control housing prices. </p>

<p>Again, alternative source with original PDF files:  https://www.docdroid.net/lcaegRL/wef-a-blueprint-for-digital-identity-4-pdf</p>
<p>I don't know why but the original source will change the URL based on what website links to it. Never seen that before. Any IT or website folks know why they would do that?</p>
<p>Here's a training course on the isolation and quarantine of large portions of an entire community intended for government agencies, law enforcement, and emergency personnel.</p>
<p>https://ruraltraining.org/course/mgt-433/</p>
<p>I think that a "cyber pandemic" will be pushed. You will still get necessities and food like you could during the "pandemic" but the internet will get shut off, blackouts will occur, and the media will be pushing stories about people starving or suffering from lack of power or fuel. The blackouts and shortages will be bad enough to convince people that the narrative is true but not bad enough that people will be forced to live off the grid and free themselves from the government. </p>
<p>The scenario where society goes completely dark for a month or more doesn't make much sense. People will just form local groups to survive and then the government will have to deal with thousands upon thousands of independent groups that will resist any agenda pushed by globalists. Maybe there will be a total blackout for a day or two but the goal is to unite people behind a global agenda. </p>
<p>This global agenda will be global digital IDs. The current system of different national and local IDs and currencies will be called flawed and open to more "cyber attacks". Every service, government, and business will be forced to adopt to this new unified digital system and people will not be able to buy or sell without obtaining this new digital ID just like they were not able to buy without a mask. </p>
<p>It will be pushed far more than vaccines or masks. It will be enforced more heavily than masks. There will be no local government that will resist. Everyone will adapt or starve because they can't even buy food without their ID. You will be thrown in camps if you don't comply. </p>
<p>These mega prisons, colonies, ghettos, quarantine camps, etc. are not being built for the unvaccinated but rather the people that will refuse the digital ID. Anyone that refuse it can't be tracked and ruled over with an iron fist. Once you get that digital ID, you can be controlled with threats of having your ID suspended which will be the same as not having one. You can't buy anything or go anywhere while it is suspended.</p>
<p>Oh and this is why cashless society is being pushed so hard by Walmart and other corporations. A digital ID is easily defeated by hard currency which won't be available.</p>

        <p>(From u/Cataclysm2100) COVID-19 was circulating globally well before March 2020:</p>
<p>Study from the US Red Cross of blood donation samples from 9 states from mid-Dec 2019 to mid-Jan 2020.</p>
<p>Found COVID-19 antibodies in samples from all 9 states.</p>
<p>https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/press-release/2020/study-suggests-possible-new-covid-19-timeline-in-the-us.html</p>
<p>Significance: The odds of random citizens in 9 different states having all contracted it in Wuhan right before they returned home and donated blood are astronomical. So it was circulating in the US population prior to mid-Dec 2019.</p>
<p>And no one noticed.</p>

“Our protocol utilizes at least two agents with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (zinc, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin) and one antibiotic (azithromycin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone) along with inhaled budesonide and/or intramuscular dexamethasone. Albuterol nebulizer, inhaled budesonide, intravenous volume expansion with supplemental parenteral thiamine 500 mg, magnesium sulfate 4 grams, folic acid 1 gram, vitamin B12 1 mg, are administered to severely ill patients who either present or return to the clinic with severe symptoms.”<br>
“As a result, our early ambulatory treatment regimen was associated with estimated 87.6% and 74.9% reductions in hospitalization and death respectively”<br>

        <p>What a shit article. It basically just says that particles are too small to not pass through masks but that literally isn’t the point of the masks. No shit particles are too small no one ever said masks were 100% effective, but if someone sneezes or coughs or is speaking and emitting tons of droplets, those are big enough to be blocked by a mask</p>

        <p>TIL being asymptomatic COVID-19 infected means you completely cease sneezing, coughing and basically any expelling of droplets from your open nose and throat… That’s amazing, thank you for enlightening me.</p>

        <p>I never said that but coughing and sneezing doesn't happen often and is usually caused by allergies or being sick. It is considered a symptom so you can't be asymptomatic with a cough or sneeze.</p>

        <p>Dear u/r_hove, please see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o28j4o/scientific_proof_masks_dont_work_and_cause_harm/h253v8y">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o28j4o/scientific_proof_masks_dont_work_and_cause_harm/h253v8y</a> for an interpretation of TheLastAmericanVagabond's collection of mask studies. Reading each of the articles in full, the conclusions I arrived at were:</p>
<ul>
<li>cloth masks may or may not be highly effective, this depends on the specific mask.</li>
<li>cloth mask efficacy declines significantly after repeated washing.</li>
<li>medical/N95 masks are effective with proper use.</li>
<li>masks should be replaced often, for example a single surgical mask should not be worn in medical settings for more than 6 hours.</li>

        <p>Correct. The problem with the claim "masks don't work" is that it is a facile, sweeping generalization. What mask? What's it made out of? What does it filter? How is the fit? How it it maintained? What type of setting is it used in? There are many variable that effect whether a mask "works" or not. "Masks don't work" is vapid sloganeering for people who don't what to think to much about anything at all, just want to rant against "the government".</p>

        <p>Well if used in general population, most people aren’t going to be using the gold standard mask filter. I’ve seen a large population of people using cloth masks or bandanas and people constantly touching/adjusting there masks which is unhygienic. Also there’s evidence if people were to reuse a mask constantly and never clean it, it can lead to bacteria pneumonia than be a covid case when tested for it with the pcr. </p>
<p>Masks can work depending on how hygienic the population is and the type of mask/strain of virus. Different viruses are different shapes/sizes and certain masks don’t have filters small enough to block the viral particles.</p>

        <p>Inflated case counts up to Jan 2020 using a huge amount of cycles on the PCR test:</p>
<p>https://archive.is/ifpcp</p>
<p>I worked in an undergraduate molybio lab for years and ran a thermocycler myself. 40 cycles is insane, the error rate would be so high, you'd likely start amplifying non-target DNA.</p>
<p>You will literally never see a published research paper that uses PCR at 40 cycles. Not for quant, amp, or diagnostics.</p>

        <p>This entire subreddit has become an echo chamber. Anyone of dissenting opinion regarding vaccines and the government is shut down, which oddly enough seems to reverse in my daily life. That reversal does shed some light on the frustration that seems to be coursing throughout this sub. I can agree that there are pros and cons to both sides and opening that conversation up is what this forum is supposed to offer. Unfortunately confirmation bias and strawman arguments are seeping out of every corner. If you see this comment, please make an effort to treat each other respectfully while discussing the facts and sorting through misinformation.</p>

        <p>100 cases of covid-19 on the Royal Navy's flagship. All crew members have had 2 doses of the vaccines. All crew members were required to wear masks and continue socially distancing. Yet, they still caught covid despite being completely vaccinated and following all CDC guidelines.

        <p>Is it worth adding a section for mask harms?  Even if they’re pretty minimal, stuff like children’s development with facial recognition etc seem worth mentioning.  I’m pretty sure there are problematic psychological effects from masks in general actually</p>

        <p>Science against masks:</p>
<p>"Intuition would suggest that facemasks offer a physical barrier preventing the emanation of droplets from the oral or nasal passages and therefore satisfy the efficacy requirement of the evidence ladder. However, there are a number of different hypotheses as to why this may not be the case. ‘Venting’ is a phenomenon whereby air leaks at the interface between mask and face which can act to disperse potential contaminants originating from the pharynx. The accumulation of moisture, during prolonged usage, may exacerbate this problem by increasing resistance to air flow through the filter itself. Moisture accumulation is also thought to facilitate the movement of contaminants through the material of the mask itself by capillary action. These bacteria can subsequently be dislodged by movement. Friction at the face/mask interface has also been demonstrated to disperse skin scales which can further contribute towards wound contamination."</p>

        <p>Hate to break it to you, but the federal reserve has already been enslaving the masses for decades with the current currency. Every dollar you touch is owed back with interest, and therefore, we are already wage slaves.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not saying you're wrong, and I hope it doesn't come to that, but we should be more afraid of them making a worldwide currency (possibly like the one you're talking about)</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right, but at the very least, in the current paradigm, you have some possibility of escape and anonymity. Once CBDC's are in use, you'll permanently be a serf and all of your descendants will be too. You'll have a zero percent chance of ever increasing your net worth and building a good life for yourself. And from the looks of it, they won't even allow you to make decisions about your own body. If they decide all of a sudden, some country doesn't want to play their games anymore, they could kill off every citizen within the border by the flip of a switch.</p>

        <p>This is what I was saying though.</p>
<p>What I mean is that when currency crashes maybe they'll take our property and makes us all dependant of the digital coin. </p>
<p>And if they don't like you they turn off your money. </p>
<p>Our current enslavement is different.</p>

        <p>Very nicely put together. I knew from the start it was financial related, but only based on all of the rate cuts the bank of canada and the fed had been making in March 2020. The fed made their 2nd rate cut on Sunday the 15th; they moved their meeting up from the 18th. </p>
<p>That Executive Order on the vaccines is interesting.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is the only piece to this puzzle I can't really figure out. I've read some interesting theories though.</p>
<ol>
<li>The vaccine is a way to mine cryptocurrencies for the banking cartel to profit from and distribute universal basic income.</li>
<li>The vaccine links your biology and DNA information to the cloud so you can be tracked and monitored 24/7/365.</li>
<li>The vaccine is for massive scale depopulation.</li>
<li>The vaccine is <em>causing</em> the pandemic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether any of these things are true, I honestly don't know. But considering the pandemic and lockdowns began the <em>moment</em> the global financial system began to break down makes me seriously wonder.</p>

        <p>I believe all 4. Regarding number 1, I understand that they have invented something that mines crypto, so to speak, based on how much your body moves.</p>

They successfully created and patented this vaccine by using anti-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). But then they took it a step further, they combined it into a dual vaccine by splicing the HCG into other viruses such as vacinia, tetanus, and other common diseases. </p>
<p>The WHO could now give these vaccines out to serve their intended purpose but also cause infertility. Essentially, this is because it causes your body to register natural HCG in the reproductive system as harmful and your body will attack and destroy it. They had multiple countries working to perfect the HCG including the Department of Human Services in the US. They said under the patent, research and publications of multiple articles:</p>
<p>"Population is growing at a rapid pace in many economically developing countries and there is a continuing need of an alternate method for regulation of fertility. We proposed several years back a birth control vaccine which induces the formation of antibodies against the human pregnancy hormone, the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). These inventions are described in patents issued in India, U.S.A. and several other countries."</p>
<p>Here are a few (of many) sources:</p>
<p>https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0494158B1/en</p>
<p>https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1991005049A1/en</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/6/1/166/875911?redirectedFrom=fulltext</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1618603/</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/20/12/3271/2913771</p>
<p>They then got in a bit of trouble around 2015-2016 as the WHO distributes vaccines across the world, especially to impoverished countries. A doctor in Kenya experienced 2 spontaneous miscarriages after taking tetanus shots that the WHO had distributed. She became suspicious of a correlation and investigated further with the assistance of the catholic church. They tested the remaining viles of tetanus vaccines and did in fact find traces of HCG where there should be none.</p>

<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12346214/</p>
<p>When it comes to the vaccine concerns, the Gates foundation accounts for 45% of WHO’s funding from nongovernmental entities. Due to both WHO and Gates having population agendas over the last 40+ years it spread many rumors over a deadly vaccine. For others, the concern was massive populations being sterilized. To be honest I can't say the  concerns of fertility effects are unfounded. Below is an additional link outlining the involvement of Bill Gates with Who on the spliced HGC Vaccines:

        <p>As a counter to all the quiverfulls who believe there is no such thing as overpopulation, I recommend reading up on behavioral sink and how it compares to what we see in society today.</p>

<p>Not the best link, but also not an official submission either.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I don't support depopulation, but maybe we should all bear in mind that mass hysteria only increases with population growth. Was liking this thread until the usual infertiliy/depopulation stuff lol</p>

        <p>He should also make a category for the severity of covid. We all know the virus isn't nearly as deadly as they act like it is. The vast majority of people who believe in the covid narrative still don't know the difference between CFR and IFR. When you know the truth about how mild this virus is, then the entire narrative comes crashing down.</p>

        <p>We really need to work on finding ways to educate “normies” who are open minded. Realistically, that is the best chance of resistance. The oligarchy have their own forms of propaganda and near limitless resources. We need to be using propaganda on our side as well. Propaganda that is true. Our only advantage is the truth. Though we lack resources compared to them, we don’t have to lie, and the truth is instead logically consistent. I have already talked with at least ten acquaintances over the past month about this info, and it helps to have compelling information available to show at a moment’s notice. I actually created my own private telegram group with some of the most damning studies, charts, videos, similar to this thread. During conversation with people who are open minded, I would make mention to this, and would be ready to show the individual the information and where it came from and encourage them to research as well. If each of us can educate and inform five open minded people, and each of those can do the same, we can have an awakening and a resistance drastically increase in size. They know this, and this is why they are coming for the internet next I believe, as well as even SMS messages. Again, we need easy to digest propaganda that is true that can help inform</p>

        <p>"There just aren't any answers yet, one way or the other, about how the coronavirus that's now ravaging the world began. And we are not taking the position that this evidence is stronger in favor of one or another hypothesis. I think we probably even have varying views on that. But what we are saying is that the existing evidence has not ruled out a laboratory origin, nor has it ruled out a natural origin. And there's really no positive evidence, either. It's just pretty much a lack of evidence right now. And we're calling for this to be resolved because it's an important question."</p>

        <p>In the WHO’s 200+ Covid report last year, they gave less than a page to discuss lab origins. Below is the entirety of their statement and the link for the full report. </p>
<p>“The epidemiology working group closely examined the possibilities of identifying earlier cases of COVID-19 through studies from surveillance of morbidity due to respiratory diseases in and around Wuhan in late 2019. It also drew on national sentinel surveillance data; laboratory confirmations of disease; reports of retail pharmacy purchases for antipyretics, cold and cough medications; a convenience subset of stored samples of more than 4500 research project samples from the second half of 2019 stored at various hospitals in Wuhan, the rest of Hubei Province and other provinces. In none of these studies was there evidence of an impact of the causative agent of COVID-19 on morbidity in the months before the outbreak of COVID-19.
Furthermore, surveillance data on all-cause mortality and pneumonia-specific mortality from Wuhan city and the rest of Hubei Province were reviewed. The documented rapid increase in all-cause mortality
  6
The TORs envisaged an
Phase 1 of short-
 term studies to better understand how the virus might have been introduced and started to circulate in
 Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>and pneumonia-specific deaths in the third week of 2020 indicated that virus transmission was widespread among the population of Wuhan by the first week of 2020. The steep increase in mortality that occurred one to two weeks later among the population in the Hubei Province outside Wuhan suggested that the epidemic in Wuhan preceded the spread in the rest of Hubei Province.
Both surveillance data and cases reported to the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS) in China were subjected to clinical review. The NNDRS was notified of 174 COVID-19 cases with onset of symptoms in December 2019. In an extensive exercise by 233 health institutions in Wuhan, some 76,253 records of cases of respiratory conditions in the two months of October and November before the outbreak in late 2019 were scrutinized clinically. Although 92 cases were considered to be compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection after review, subsequent testing and further external multidisciplinary clinical review determined that none was in fact due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the analysis of this and other surveillance data, it is considered unlikely that any substantial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection was occurring in Wuhan during those two months.”</p>
<p>Study done from January 2020-February 2021
“Assessment of likelihood:
In view of the above, a laboratory origin of the pandemic was considered to be extremely unlikely.
What would be needed to increase knowledge?
Regular administrative and internal review of high-level biosafety laboratories worldwide. Follow-up of new evidence supplied around possible laboratory leaks”</p>

        <p>There is no pandemic besides what the government created. I drew a graph of death data from the last five years in N. Ireland. I took the data from the Office of National Statistics. The only unusual spikes are when the government was putting sick old people into nursing homes from the hospital, but even then it didn't surpass a winter month. Surely a deadly pandemic would be somewhat more noticeable? I can't add an image to this  for some reason but it should be easily repeatable by anyone with a spreadsheet.</p>

        <p>Number 2 ain't gonna happen. Nothing can convince someone who still doesn't fucking get it. If anything, it seems a wall was hit or switch was flipped or something that's causing previously-skeptical people to to give in to the hysteria. Despite being 2 years in and the virus only growing less dangerous. I understand those who've always been afraid still being afraid, but it seems odd how many people who are "switching sides" this late in the game.</p>

        <p>In the case of those I know who flipped the other way, at least one came home from the hospital - supposedly had COVID, but even the hospital admitted the ventilator is what almost killed her - with an anti-psychotic drug that has no use I can find - not insomnia, not RLS, nothing really - aside from doping up "crazy" people. I can't help but wonder.</p>

        <p>The closest thing I’ve known personally to switching to the other side is people caving to the vaccine pressure even though they know it’s wrong, because they’re afraid of losing their rights or whatever.  It’s a real shame when they do that...</p>

        <p>That could be part of it, and maybe they're just trying to convince themselves otherwise. But it really seems like certain people are fine if kept away from talk shows and the TV news until they get their fix and you can almost hear an audible "click" as a switch is flipped.</p>

        <p>Science against masks: <br>
"Intuition would suggest that facemasks offer a physical barrier preventing the emanation of droplets from the oral or nasal passages and therefore satisfy the efficacy requirement of the evidence ladder. However, there are a number of different hypotheses as to why this may not be the case. ‘Venting’ is a phenomenon whereby air leaks at the interface between mask and face which can act to disperse potential contaminants originating from the pharynx. The accumulation of moisture, during prolonged usage, may exacerbate this problem by increasing resistance to air flow through the filter itself. Moisture accumulation is also thought to facilitate the movement of contaminants through the material of the mask itself by capillary action. These bacteria can subsequently be dislodged by movement. Friction at the face/mask interface has also been demonstrated to disperse skin scales which can further contribute towards wound contamination."</p>
