    <strong>I’d be drinking every day if I could...</strong>
    <p><p>Being locked up at home with not much to do has been so bad for me mentally. My friends are doomers so I’ve nobody to meet up with. I’ve a partner who isn’t a doomer to the extent but he and I share very different views on this so I am pretty much alone in this. My partners life hasn’t changed much at all, with the exception of no ability to travel abroad. His life has stayed the same between college online and video games the rest of time. I am no social butterfly, but it’s gotten too much now. If I wasn’t trying to lose weight I’d be drinking alcohol daily... the craving is there but unfortunately I would only temporarily relieve the anxiety and stress as in the morning I’d be faced with the same routine and news headlines of doom and gloom. </p>
<p>I am terrified of the fact you will more than likely need to be vaccinated to travel, and I will pretty much be stuck at home. Who knows, maybe friends will turn on each other as some will be vaccinated and others won’t be. Why would it even matter if someone has a vaccine or not for travel. You’d infect people around you no matter where you go if you’re not vaccinated. If you need it for travel then why wouldn’t you need it to enter certain buildings in the name of protection! Makes no sense.</p></p>

        <p>Keep the faith. Hope the warmer weather picks spirits up a bit &amp; the lockdowns ease wherever you’re at. Plenty have had a tough time with bad habits during this, &amp; I can testify that you’re right that drinking is only a temporary fix. You should talk to your partner about it! You guys should be working together to make sure you get out more, even if it’s just the two of you. Having different views shouldn’t keep you from sharing how you’re feeling during this</p>

        <p>I drink pretty much 3 or 4 times a week, its the only thing that keeps me from utter despair. I don't get shitfaced just enough to face people and act like a "normal" person, even family. Its very hard to communicate with people who are all happy smiley while the world crumbles around us, so alcohol makes that easier, very few people are real anymore and idk wtf is in their drinking water but they don't seem to be having a normal response to whats going on.</p>

        <p>You sound like you need some help. Quite a lot do. That is completely understandable given the circumstances. I am less affected by this stuff. Mainly because I come from a conspiracy background and when I came back from my ski trip last February I told my wife to expect the shit to hit the fan and decide if she would take a vaccine. She was freaking out because she said how do you know we will be getting a vaccine. Anyway shortly after that I cancelled my TV license and since then the mainstream garbage news has not got into my family home.</p>
<p>Advice for what it's worth. Do lose weight, get fit you might need to be fit, very fit moving forward. Don't watch garbage news. Listen to some motivational speeches. Anything you like, if you can't think of anything I recommend Manly P Hall, which are on yt. Go outside and get some sunshine, meditate, look after yourself. Drinking every day is not the answer, don't give in to this stuff. They are playing some seriously strong psychological games with everyone atm.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Ps I like wine every now and then, so don't sweat it if you have the odd drink.</p>

        <p>Please don’t. I am a social butterfly as you put it and I’ve had a bunch of other things compound to make this year horrible but for the love of god don’t start drinking every day like I have. I’m quite ashamed what has happened to me in a short time. Find something, anything. Take care of yourself. I’m mid 20s and suddenly the toll this has taken in just a year is pretty terrifying. All day every day. I could have saved money but it perpetuates itself because you just expect the world to end so why save? Then you drink some more and get more depressed from being broke and not being able to see people.. it’s terrible</p>
