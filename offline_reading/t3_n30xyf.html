        <p>Thanks for posting op. I’m not pregnant but I have been having terrible symptoms for over a week after prolonged exposure to someone who was vaccinated.</p>
<p>I was really shaking and missed my period, it eventually happened but it was way late. Racing thoughts and temperature regulation are the main problems I’m having now. And headache accompanied with dizziness.</p>
<p>I haven’t felt able to work or even drive (I normally drive A LOT, on the interstate, all over the fucking place) for almost 2 weeks.</p>
<p>People will want to give me shit but I have no idea what’s happening to my body.</p>

        <p>At what point does hundreds of anecdotes become data and cause for concern? If 500 unvaccinated women all report they have painful menstrual cycles after being around a vaxxed person isn’t that a cause for concern? If hundreds of people took advil and reported the lowering of fever would that still be anecdotal?</p>

        <p>When there has been a study to verify what's happening. You know. Like there has been for the safety of the vaccine.</p>
<p>There are also thousands of people reporting that voodoo works. It doesn't matter what some people think a causation might be. This is like asking "but if 500 people report their house is haunted...!"</p>

        <p>Equating personal experience to superstition is ludicrous. If your drug did this would you really say to hundreds of women that they are liars and seeking attention? Tell me when will they set up a study to test the “veracity” of this? What woman would risk their entire livelihood to make a claim that her menstrual cycle is off? You think women don’t have jobs on the line  here?</p>

<p>Who - "they"? Why don't you do it yourself? It's science - it's reproducible.</p>
<p>There is an obvious problem though. How do you build a control group out of people who never contact anyone who's vaccinated? https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/health/article/Half-of-Texas-adults-have-now-had-at-least-one-16139621.php - half of the population in Texas had the vaccine. In Israel, most of the population had both doses already. So you're in serious trouble here... Want to keep the volunteers in the basement to ensure that they never meet anyone vaccinated?</p>

        <p>Oh superstutious people aren't lying many times. They just see something and interprete it the wrong way.</p>
<p>You know how many vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, yes? Of course there are people with menstrual problems after they've been around someone. Like with literally everything else.</p>
<p>Maybe they'll do a study if it:</p>
<p>First makes sense that it has something to do with the vaccine. Which it doesn't.</p>
<p>Second if there would be numbers outside the norm. Which there aren't.</p>

        <p>You understand every ‘study’ and ‘trial’ done collects anecdotal evidence? You report your side effects in the trial just like all of these women and men are reporting reactions here. It’s not that hard to understand. There is also a study conducted currently at the University of Illinois by a DOCTOR who experienced her own menstrual issues after the shot. The study is conducted by people submitting their experiences. You can see the study here: https://redcap.healthinstitute.illinois.edu/surveys/index.php?s=LL8TKKC8DP</p>

        <p>Yes, but it's study is different because you can control for other factors - with a placebo group and so on. To conclude there is an effect from the vaccines you'd have to question EVERY menstruating person about how their cycles went after the vaccine and question those with the placebo too. You'd also have to look at the medical history of those people - if someone has irregular periods all their life and after the vaccine that continues, it's weak evidence for the vaccine causing the problem.</p>

        <p>Is this a survey of unvaccinated people? Or vaccinated?</p>
<p>And this survey isn't a proper study, it's just a small survey. It can't be good enough to publish it anywhere. A proper study follows hundreds of women around before and after half of them gets a vaccine, and half - a placebo.</p>
<p>With hundreds of millions of women already having received the vaccine around the globe, you'd expect a huge wave of complaints to gynos though, right? Doesn't look like gynos know of that. In some countries, half of the population already got 2 shots. And you're pointing to whopping DOZENS of reports about this worldwide?</p>

<p>You sound funny. "Yes, I have proof, but I won't show it to you". So basically you don't have proof, right? Otherwise, you could at least present one peer reviewed publication.</p>
<p>&rt; Can you explain to me why all the placebo groups in the v a x trial have been unblinded before the completion of the trial?</p>
<p>I've no idea which trial you're talking about, so I can't comment on that. Is this something you read on Facebook too?</p>

<p>I'm so so sorry that you're going through this and I can only hope that you have a doctor to discuss this complication with.  In the meantime, I'm here to listen and I know that there are other women experiencing similar complications from contact with vaccinated people - we need a support group STAT.

        <p>Most people who are prone to anti-vax or anti-science ideology score high on the dark triad personality traits, have narcissistic, sociopathic tendencies, are extremely likely to lie to promote their agenda, or simply to gain attention. Nothing new here. They're also usually not very intelligent and aren't taught how to work with information to minimize the risk of bias. Anything they say should be taken with an extra large grain of salt.</p>
<p>Assuming what you say is true, and reflects how you actually feel, you might look up on placebo. You are given a pill and told that it will make your head hurt. It's very likely that your head will actually hurt after you take the pill, even if you're not prone to headaches. So obviously you connect one to the other and think the pill caused the headache. And then you find out that the pill is just a bit of sugar and has no active components. Your head wouldn't have hurt if you hadn't been told about this connection, and treated the pill like a tic tac.</p>
<p>If you're gullible and ill-educated, told that all vaccines are bad, and that contacting vaccinated people are dangerous, then of course you are likely to develop psychosomatic symptoms exactly like what you're describing. Periods are especially prone to mood effects. Nothing new here. That's why proper studies don't just ask one random person how they feel.</p>
