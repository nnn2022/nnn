    <strong>They're not even hiding the fact that they intend to never let us return to normal.</strong>
    <p><p>It went from <em>"we'll go back to normal after a vaccine"</em> to <em>"we need to reshape society and the way we interact forever"</em>...</p>
<p>And it seems like so many people are completely fine with this. Personally speaking, I don't really wanna spend the rest of my life living through webcams and computer screens, but apparently that makes me an insane terrorist.</p></p>

        <p>I dunno why you get downvotes. The shield is a lesser version of the mask. You can at least see the face of the person wearing</p>
<p>The shields were allowed here for customer workers but since more draconian measures, now masks are mandatory.</p>

        <p>Well, I don't know what to tell you. Welcome to the world, where germs are everywhere? I dunno what kind of died you have but that stuff has been breathed on million times over the time it gets to the restaurant. It's not supposed to be sterile. And if it is, it's probably not good for you.</p>

        <p>Virus is not spread by droplets.  It's airborne transmission just like influenza as per the CDC.  Faceshields don't stop or slow that kind of transmission and neither do facemasks.</p>
<p>And there still isn't proof that everyone and their kids are spreading covid anyway.  None.  The virus did its damage in March and April.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

        <p>Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer was saying in July how we would have to do “2 or 3 years of social distancing and wearing masks” after a vaccine comes out. Now all I keep seeing is Biden/Harris saying were in for a “dark winter”, google “dark winter” and the first thing that comes up is a Johns Hopkins simulation of a bio terror attack on the US. It’s so obvious they’re gonna release some kind of new virus that will actually be extremely deadly and dangerous, rather than relying on a faulty PCR test for “cases”</p>

        <p>I think that's just the usual Lib fluff. If they actually wanted to fix racism then they wouldn't have encouraged messing up the education system even harder, for almost a year in some locations. They'd also be seriously talking about class. Not to mention the need for a Presidential candidate who didn't want to bomb brown people.</p>

        <p>&rt; Because so many organizations and people are blindly going with "once there is a vaccine, covid will be gone".</p>
<p>I hear a lot of the opposite from official channels. Basically "Dont expect things to go back to normal". I do think they have "covered their ass" though. I think <em>they</em> know that what people imagine when they hear that ("we will have to keep washing our hands") is not what is meant ("CovidPass needed to enter buildings").</p>

        <p>Well I don't really have much of a choice when it's medical/dental. Yeah, I can try to find somewhere else, but they're all the same, and after delays of weeks or months just to get the appointments that I <em>could</em> get, I don't know what you expect me to do about that. Let a needed filling go and end up with a wholly unnecessary abscess? </p>

        <p>Yup, my wife works from home now, she is well aware her time is limited. We actually talked about spending time in Mexico and maybe living there. I drive a truck for a living, local pickups and deliveries so that's a tough one to automate but could be farmed out in a borderless future. I spent time looking at dispatch jobs that were remote and it's actually a thing. I can't live in the states for 13 dollars an hour but dispatching from Mexico making that money works.</p>

<p>You don't have to. You can wear masks and be responsible by not going to large gatherings. We've seen viruses in the past been beaten before if society as a whole cooperates and works for one another. But naw, you guys are too selfish. "CuZ mUh FrEeDoM!"</p>

        <p>Who's talking about BLM protested and biden celebrations? It shows your color when you default go to politics. This pandemic is beyond that but small brains like you are so entwined in it being political that you default to it in every discussion. I can do the same thing and reverse it. See what happens when you go to celebrations and gatherings without masks ? Republican party can answer that for you.</p>
<p>Also, there are studies shown that BLM protests for the most part were responsibly distanced with masks in open area and didn't increase the spread rate. </p>
<p>Poverty, suicide, and cancer is still a concern. So let's ignore a pandemic virus? The fuck you even blabbering about.</p>

        <p>Still no proof that everyone has covid.  None.  </p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives).  The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best.  Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives.  They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more.  Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test!  Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask.  The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection  of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that  2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Page 39.  (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Since  no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available,  assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with  characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene;  GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked  into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral  transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza.  Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage.  The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April.  That was proven without any doubt.  Influenza kills children and young adults.  Covid kills the elderly.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it?  Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you?  I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

        <p>Still no proof that everyone has covid. None.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

        <p>They actually think wearing a mask is a "new normal" because it forces them to wear something over their face. I've been wearing a mask all year and feel like my day-to-day has not changed whatsoever. Pathetic people who has never had hardship in their life cries about some small changes for the better of everyone else.</p>

        <p>First . none of my grandmas lived to see this. I am grateful in ways because I cannot imagine the hell this is for older people. I actually follow the rules out of fear. So I'm not killing anyone. All I am guilty of is thought crime for questioning the narrative. I'm far from alt right. Before this I was actually pretty far left. I have lost all respect for a lot of the left because actual progressivism has been replaced by allegiance to authority and virtue signalling. Freedom of thought is being censored. I have follow the rules because of circumstances but I  allowed to think many of them are stupid and arbitrary. Critical thinking is not allowed anymore.</p>

        <p>In regard to virtue signaling and thought policing you are right. Those are my issues with the left. They do not want to hear dissent in regards to certain issues, and I believe that to be one of their main faults. </p>
<p>However, this is a separate issue. This is a pandemic. You just said “I actually follow the rules out of fear, so I’m not killing anyone”. So you’re saying that not wearing a mask does kill people? It’s not a liberal narrative right now. This is the entire scientific community freaking out because no one is paying attention to safety precautions during a pandemic. You are not thinking critically. You are not being empathetic to people who look after their grandparents. You are not questioning the correct narrative. This pandemic is a fact, people are dying, and their last breaths are sucked in through a ventilator. Please, for the love of god, continue to wear your mask.</p>

        <p>&rt; This is a pandemic.</p>
<p>Do you know that if this had happened any time before 2009 it wouldnt have qualified as a pandemic?</p>
<p>The definition of "pandemic" was changed in 2009 by the WHO, so they could declare the 2009 Swine Flu a pandemic. Essentially, they lowered the bar, making it easier to declare "epidemics" into "pandemics".</p>
<p>Swine Flu ended up being not much of a pandemic, despite all the experts crying armageddon, and a massive vaccination rollout that was considered largely worthless, although it made pharma companies billions.</p>
<p>Total deaths of the Swine Flu?  20,000.  Although I imagine they could increase that number by broadening the definition of "what counts as a Swine Flu death". By tinkering with definitions and classifications you can pretty much get any number you want.  .. right?</p>
<p>Think it's crazy to imagine everyone going along with a "bad call"?</p>
<p>Take a look at the 2010 article. Bit of deja vu.</p>
<p>https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/reconstruction-of-a-mass-hysteria-the-swine-flu-panic-of-2009-a-682613-amp.html</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Now turned up, the machinery was set into motion. Researchers got to work examining the molecular structure of the virus. The pharmaceutical industry started to develop vaccines. Government agencies laid out disaster plans. There was only one thing that everyone was ignoring: The new pathogen was, in fact, relatively harmless.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;How did all this happen?<br>
&rt; <br>
&rt;Does this mean that a very mild course of the pandemic was not even considered from the start? At any rate, efforts to downplay the risks were unwelcome, and the WHO made it clear that it preferred to base its decisions on a worst-case scenario. <strong>"We wanted to overestimate rather than underestimate the situation," says Fukuda.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Jan. 26, 2010: Wolfgang Wodarg, a member of the German parliament, tells the European Council in Strasbourg that <strong>"millions of people worldwide were vaccinated for no good reason."</strong> According to Wodarg, the WHO's classification of the swine flu as a pandemic have earned the pharmaceutical companies $18 billion in additional revenues. Annual sales of Tamiflu alone have jumped 435 percent, to €2.2 billion. <br>
&rt; <br>
&rt;What was this pandemic? Was it all just "good practice for an emergency," as WHO advisor and industry lobbyist Osterhaus puts it? Did the authorities do everything right, as Australian epidemiologist John Mackenzie insists?
&rt; <br>
&rt;Certainly not. <strong>No one at the WHO, RKI or PEI should feel proud of themselves. These organizations have gambled away precious confidence. When the next pandemic arrives, who will believe their assessments?</strong></p>
<p>WHO indeed?</p>

        <p>Do you guys just copy and paste stuff you collect in a folder or something? I love the sketchy German website angle to your post, just adds a whole other layer lmao. You guys really like to compare this to a flu huh. Did anyone here bother to check the death rates for covid compared to the flu this year? Isn’t it a little strange to you that China shut down their entire economy and Italy’s hospitals were over capacity for several months with people hooked on ventilators? lol exactly like the swine flu you’re right </p>
<p>I don’t even know why I’m still engaging with you dweebs. I should just take a hint from you and start copy and pasting responses, because you guys all say the exact same shit lmao</p>

        <p>Still no proof that everyone has covid. None.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

        <p>Literally what do you think millions of doctors, health officials, chemists, biologists, engineers, businesspeople, and more are trying to do right now? They’re all focused on getting a cure out for COVID so that we can all return to normal. They’re working around the clock. And for some reason you selfish non scientists think they’re not moving fast enough so you go about tearing everything apart by not wearing your masks and breaking lockdowns and curfews. We are working really hard so that all of us can go back to our normal lives, but this doesn’t happen overnight. You think we enjoy it? I can’t see anyone in family because I’m a high risk worker in a health-related field. I can’t go out with my friends. I can’t see people. Nobody likes living this way, I fucking hate it and I want it to end too. But the reality of the situation is that if I don’t follow these procedures, I end up putting people I love at risk. A vaccine isn’t a silver bullet, because some people can’t be immunized if they’re immunocompromised or have an allergy to an ingredient in the medicine. And then there’s a whole subset of the population who will refuse the vaccine because of their nonsensical nihilist beliefs combined with an inability to understand how the immune system works. I know it’s a lot to ask, but now more than ever, we need you to work with us, because the only way we can beat this virus is if you take our advice. We actually do know what we’re talking about because we’ve trained in this area for decades. It’s what we do.</p>

        <p>You have a source on that? Also those gatherings were held outside, and almost everyone was wearing a mask. It’s still not ideal and I wouldn’t attend one because I risk making others sick. But I support BLM, and I’ve donated too, because that’s a social cause worth fighting for, even in a pandemic.

<p>“However, as public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission. We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States.”</p>
<p>Can you at least understand why some people read this and then think that lockdowns are complete garbage?</p>
<p>In the picture on the link there is a person screaming and not wearing a mask. But according to the “experts” these are not risky for COVID-19 transmission?!</p>
<p>Governors and health officials are getting caught left and right violating their own mandates. Hardcore mask supporters still get the virus. </p>
<p>People scream to “trust the science!” But the science isn’t conclusive on masks of lockdowns. </p>
<p>Everyone needs to think critically about this situation. Read some studies that go against your preconceived notions. I have, and still do.</p>

        <p>500,000 people (That's half a million) came from all over the US to gather in Sturgis South Dakota for a bike rally.  They then all went back home and there has not been a rush on hospitals because of it.  </p>
<p>NO ONE THERE WORE MASKS.  And no one died.</p>
<p>You keep saying we'll all die if we don't wear masks and it keeps not happening.</p>
<p>Still no proof that everyone has covid. None.</p>
<p>Tests are delivering false positives at a rate of over 90% and that's been ruled by the court in Portugal (only they ruled it as 97% false positives). The FDA and the creator of the test have both stated that it's unreliable at best. Even the NYT posted an article stating that it gives 90% false positives. They are only supposed to run it at 25 amplification cycles yet hospitals and labs around the world are doing 40 cycles or more. Many places are giving out positives even if the person doesn't show up to do the test! Meaning, if you don't show up when you're told to test, it's an automatic positive.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not being irresponsible for not wearing a mask. The testing sites and labs are being irresponsible for purposely doctoring the results to keep people like you scared.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>

<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</li>
<li>The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.</li>
<li>This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page 39. (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

        <p>I feel sorry for you if you think that scientists, politicians and business people can't be corrupt.
You want a cure for covid? More than half of the people who were hospitalised with covid had vitamin D deficiency. One of the reasons why it affects people from certain minorities more often.
Another solution? Weight loss. Again, obese people are twice as likely to be hospitalised and die from it. Honestly, if we tackled that issue gently while still treating people like living beings that deserve respect we could have went much further. Imagine trying to prevent people's condition from getting worse AND protecting the nursing homes better. That's like half the problem gone.
We told people to lock up in their homes and avoid anything that might help them regain some sort of normalcy again and we failed to protect the most vulnerable. We completely ignored any sort of cure that is not a vaccine. We told people to live in fear and avoid doing things that might have a positive effect on their health, both mental and physical.
What we're doing in 2020 is medieval. A virus with 99.5% survival rate for anyone under 70 and here we are, a year later, waiting anxiously for a new vaccine that has been developed for 1/5th the time than any other vaccine in human history. I am sorry that you see this whole situation as normal because it's not. Trust me, think about it a year from now. We f**ed up massively.</p>

        <p>I've followed all the rules, the fact someone disagrees doesn't mean they won't. I got covid anyway, incidentally. We've had high compliance here in the UK at least initially, it doesn't just make a virus stop.</p>
<p>What makes this vaccine so different to others? Most of the population, including those actually at risk, haven't been pressured to have the flu vaccine. It's been understood as an at-own-risk thing in most situations, except some travel ones. Why is this what's meant to be the one defining issue? And enough to judge if someone is selfish? Ok, so covid-compliance is the basic expectation to you. Well then, to me, it's veganism and anti-militarism are the minimum bars. If someone is neither, then obviously pandemic prevention and protecting life aren't actually a concern of theirs.</p>
<p>I won't have the vaccine on positive principles because of the way my government has treated us throughout all this. It is a lot to ask, you're right, but none of this has been asked, it's been demanded, coerced, and forced. There's been little to no mitigation for some of the impact and then that attitude on top of it, and then they think they own our bodies too? At the moment our (disableist) government have a committee discussing whether the mental health act provides precedent to force vaccination. If I lived where  I want to be, in France, rather than in the UK under Dictator Boris, I'd be more willing to have it even, because while the rules aren't better, at least the communication has been that much better, with a statement that vaccines won't be mandated, and I'm reassured by the population's willingness to riot when they feel it necessary.</p>
<p>As far as selfishness goes, though, as a severe medical negligence victim -perhaps you can understand why bodily autonomy might be a sensitive issue to me-, who has lost access to healthcare due to lockdown, I have more reason than most not to blindly trust 'healthcare workers'. There is a point at which it's not just reasonable but right to ask, not only 'What about me?' but -as it's far from just me but many disabled and chronically ill people in this position- 'What about us?'.</p>

<p>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza. Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage. The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April. That was proven without any doubt. Influenza kills children and young adults. Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it? Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you? I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>

        <p>Funny how all the doctors and scientists I listen to say the total opposite, and they just happen to be the ones who aren’t backed and funded by the same people that stand to directly benefit off the back of it.</p>
