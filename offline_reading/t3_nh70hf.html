    <strong>Why people are so compliant about the lockdown rules</strong>
    <p><p>This is largely speculation, but I’m curious to know if others see what I’m seeing. (TL/DR at bottom.)</p>
<p>I’ve been wondering for a while why people have been so compliant with the government’s oppressive and arbitrary rules related to the Covid situation. A hundred years ago, maybe even 30-40 years ago, most people would have told them to get stuffed, but now it seems the vast majority are not only completely compliant, but proud of it. </p>
<p>What occurs to me is that these days, our society has completely fractured. Whereas we once held a national identify (and no, I’m not trying to ignore racism/sexism), today it seems that few people identify first and foremost as an American. On top of that, many people have discovered that what we’ve been sold as the American Dream is a lie. The idea of working hard to build a secure future is now working like crazy to barely keep your head above water until you die, or until one unexpected medical bill drives you into bankruptcy. And finally, the fact that we live in our devices has seriously eroded the feeling of community we once had in our families, neighborhoods, and civic and religious institutions.</p>
<p>So in short, we are a people without a shared identity or community. And then the government comes along, manufacturing an existential threat, and calling on all the citizens of this great nation to come together and do their part to fight the good fight. And we’ve been desperate to feel worthy, and to feel part of something bigger than ourselves. So many of us jumped into this “fight” with both feet. </p>
<p>It’s like the unifying effect of World War 2 or the “Russian Menace” where we rallied together in the face of a shared enemy. It may be scary, and there may be sacrifice involved, but we were important. We mattered. And the actions we had to take served a larger purpose.</p>
<p>So when we go to people and say “it was all a lie,” we’re telling people who are hungry for meaning and community that they actually didn’t matter, that their actions were actually meaningless. That’s a tough pill to swallow.</p>
<p>I’m not sure where I’m going with this; I have no idea what to do about it. But I can tell you that it’s given me a lot of empathy to the maskers and the vaxxers, and that in many cases I’ve decided just to let them live their lives as I live mine.</p>
<p>TL/DR: For most people it was never about Covid, it was about a search for meaning and community.</p></p>

        <p>A hundred years ago, people still believed in God, and the Bible. The Bible is very clear in to be careful about our leaders, and to not be deceived. 
Today, after an eventful century that was largely aimed at detaching mankind from God, through 2 banker's world wars, the New Age, the luciferian concept of the United Nations, all the Space bullshit, and now the internet, mankind is lost. We think we know it all, we are our own gods, through that new and funky science and technology, but in essence, we have gone backwards. Ever learning, never getting to the knowledge of truth. Drifting farther away every day. This lack of anchor in our lives, made us very susceptible to lies and propaganda, including staged pandemics.</p>
<p>The west especially, after 4 decades of relative wealth and quiet, has been lulled to sleep. People in Eastern Europe are much sharper than Western Europeans, I can tell you, because they have still the memories of how communist governments lied to them, about everything. This is the only mindset you should have: mistrust everything governments say, until proven.</p>

        <p>Maybe it’s because they have usurped the birthing process, weakening the bond between parents and children. They torment babies while parents watch and act useless. So people grow up desperate for the protection that they never got and the government steps in as a parental figure. Now people have an authority figure to receive a feeling of safety from when they act like good boys and girls, filling the void left by their past trauma.</p>

        <p>That doesn't mean you're an introvert, you're just had no life. I'm as introverted as it gets and they have ruined my life because I need those small interactions at the store and on the street. Also being an introvert doesn't mean I didn't love traveling or going to the library or working out in the gym, I had a life before. It just didn't revolve around social interaction.</p>
