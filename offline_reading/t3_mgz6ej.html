    <p><p>I had the audacity to suggest on a post where they were (yet again) roasting someone for not wanting to take the mRNA vaccine, that they have a right to make that choice.  </p>
<p>I literally just said "A person's body is sacrosanct.  They have a right to make that choice." </p>
<p>Nope. Free speech is dead.  Guess we can get rid of all those constitutional rights. Or is it just when it's on the self-righteous side?</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's propaganda or if people really are this scared.  Either way these are strange times indeed.</p></p>

        <p>Lol. Yea.  It just bothers me that no one checks these people.  They go into a frenzy about it; like pitchforks and torches.  And I have gotten downvoted galore and been called all sorts of wonderful things, but never banned.  That really shocked me.</p>
<p>I don't care.  I'll sleep fine tonight.  But it did give me a chuckle.  And I'm the snowflake?  </p>
<p>If someone can't even stand to hear a contradicting idea then there is something very, very wrong going on.</p>

        <p>I think that knowing that they can't kill free speech, they are staking claims over the vast majority of areas of speech, in order to reduce its freedom.</p>

        <p>Government: Yes, you are legally allowed free speech.  </p>
<p>Media: But there are certain agendas we are pushing so in regards to those don't write it, speak it or mention it anywhere ever because that we don't allow.</p>

        <p>Very true.</p>
<p>And even though I hate Zuckerberg and all those media and tech giants, the fact the government wants to reign down on them is odd to me.  </p>
<p>Are they really trying to mitigate false news or control the entire narrative?  Do they just want to cash more million dollar checks?  Seems every so often they come hard after a corporation (for some egrarious act), fine them, slap them on the wrist and then we all go about as if nothing happened and nothing really changes.  And it all seems to coincide with public uproar against said corporations.  </p>
<p>The insurrection was not started by Facebook.  In the same way the post office isn't responsible for Aunt Sally's wedding just because they delivered the invitations.   </p>
<p>I really don't understand the madness of the world right now and everyone so willing to give up their rights and freedoms.  Fear.  Fear mongering.  Propaganda.  </p>
<p>I'm just gonna keep eating my popcorn and watch the ship go down.  But just so no one says I didn't care and at least try I speak up here and there.  Doesn't seem to move the needle.  I think we are still headed for a fall.  But that's ok I guess. Seems we all have our own brand of Koolaid and we are all sticking to it, no room for civility, no room for understanding another's point of view.   </p>
<p>Buckle up your chastity belt.  I think it's going to continue to be a bumpy ride.</p>
