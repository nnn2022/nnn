    <strong>Is anyone else exasperated with people's stupidity these days?</strong>
    <p><p>It is mentally taxing.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to sound pretentious here but.. I never, until this day, realized how stupid people are.</p>
<p>They seem unable to review facts, evidence and put things in context to think for themselves.</p>
<p>They think masks are COVID-PROOF, i.e. if you catch COVID, it's because you didn't mask up.</p>
<p>They think the flu <em>really</em> disappeared from the face of the earth because we follow ridiculous, unscientific measures.</p>
<p>They also convinced themselves that masking yourself does not hinder your breathing.</p>
<p>I'm doing my best to reason with people to get them to see the light, but it's getting harder on the mental, bros..</p></p>

        <p>No. I’m tired from the disinformation coming from the so called “experts”. Most people are just doing what the “experts” are saying. </p>
<p>When COVID first struck, the mainstream media was saying masks didn’t work, and then most people had the same opinion. Then a few weeks later the media changed their stance to masks are absolutely required, and then most people started thinking that masks were the way to go.</p>
<p>I’m exasperated by the manipulation of society by the media.</p>

        <p>I wanna know who these "experts" are. All you ever see is "the experts say this". What's their fuckin names? What are their credentials? It's just all a bunch of misleading bullshit to string you along while attempting to avoid any thought provoking notions.</p>

        <p>Every time I do see a legitimate expert with credentials talk about it, it is usually to say masks don't work and that covid is bullshit.  Then YouTube or Facebook bans them and brings on someone with no credentials to say exactly the opposite.</p>

        <p>At the beginning, the message was "wash your hands for 5 mins... etc" remember? everyone was washing their hands like crazy;  then the mask fad took over and now nobody remembers it. </p>
<p>If any celebrity or rich person went on TV telling everyone to wear a rabbit's foot on their neck to prevent Covid, people would absolutely do it.</p>

        <p>Fwiw, here in germany the Health-Ministry admitted that they only said masks didnt help in order to stock up the hospitals. Basically all you can do now is complain that they lied to you and potentially killed you by missinforming you. Problem is that all those Covidians do actually agree with the way government handled that situation. :/</p>

        <p>I mean it’s really not their fault. The way mainstream media seems to most people that don’t look into it is that FOX is biased and CNN, MSNBC,CBS, NYT,NBC are the non biased news. When all the mainstream news companies are reporting in the same way and then one is different it makes the one seem biased to these people. And if you use any social media (FB, Instagram, twitter,Snapchat, even the apple news app) they will pop these news articles in your face and what they want you to see and block out what they don’t. We’re literally brainwashed. Operation mockingbird</p>

        <p>Not even close to a good comparison.. I’ll give an example. the news is convincing people police brutality is a huge issue. Liberals feel that they are a good person/ doing the right thing by supporting blm. People aren’t going to just kill their pet because the media tells them that’s not even in the same ballpark as simply believing a fake problem going on in the world. Believing biased media≠killing your dog</p>

        <p>Here’s a good example: I was out at a bar last night in a downtown area with open container laws and lots of foot traffic. Not Nashville but that sort of thing. Tons of people coming in and out of the bars on the street to grab a drink or sit and have dinner and then walk to the next one, etc. I saw several people, way more than I could have imagined, come in to the bar, sit down and eat and drink with their masks off for 30 minutes, an hour, then, as they were walking back out into the street, put masks on. Many people are objectively stupid.</p>

        <p>It's draining. I spend half my free time fighting for freedom and understanding. Planting seeds of doubt and tried to persuade anyone who will listen for even a few minutes.
The other half of my free time is resting an healing myself. Get into nature, listen to good music, meditation, healthy food, etc. Take care of yourself. We can't help others if we are depleted. 🙏💞🌎</p>

        <p>It made me realize the lack of confidence i have in myself.  I realized that subconsciously I assumed many of my friends and acquaintances were smarter and wiser than I was, and then this event happened.  And I realized that I have been way too harsh on myself.  I have lost a lot of respect for so many people that I know.</p>

<p>I’m with you on this. And I’m even watching people I thought were smart buy in to all this propaganda. I’m in Fla and even though the governor has basically ended the pandemic in the state I still see most people wearing masks in grocery stores and the real dumb asses riding a bike or walking in the open with no one else around with a mask on.</p>

        <p>I’m of the mind that it’s laziness (which sure, you can extrapolate stupidity from) that has led us into this masquerade. It takes a lot of time, not just to sift through the enormous amount of clickbait garbage online, but to develop a technique of sourcing and verifying. Television still dominates the information sector for this very reason and corporations know how to prey on it.</p>

        <p>I think about this all the time. Especially since I know many, many objectively smart (high IQ and very accomplished) people who buy into all this nonsense. I don't think I'm smarter than they all are. I wonder how much of it has to do with the fact that I've researched and studied non-mainstream theories for years (including 'conspiracy' theories and metaphysical ideas) so am more open to questioning things.</p>

        <p>Is it stupidity, though?  </p>
<p>There are a lot of very high IQ people who've bought into the entire program.  Many are operating under a system of perverse incentives.  A few are genuinely malevolent.  Most are simply deluded.  I'd argue that the smarter a person is, the more likely they are to concoct reasonable sounding justifications for their insane beliefs.</p>

        <p>IQ is clearly just not that great a sign of non-stupidity. So you can rotate shapes in your mind and guess what number comes next in a sequence. So what? Same thing for academia. It’s just one giant human centipede of academics eating up other academics’ bullshit then shitting it out again for someone else. </p>
<p>The true intelligence we are sorely lacking is independent critical thinking. Too many people will believe whatever they’re told with no question, and when one side (the left usually) jumps in right away to say “Hey if you don’t agree with us you’re an idiot, grandma killing bigot,” they dominate the narrative from the getgo because too many people care more about how they’re perceived under social pressure and/or being “morally right” than taking a step back and analyzing it themselves. </p>
<p>Conversely, we do also have a minority of people who will think the opposite of whatever is popular just to be contrarian or whatever. This leads to nonsensical thinking too. </p>
<p>The amount of independent minded people who can take either side based on reason and rational thinking? Too damn small.</p>

        <p>The idea is to dumb the individual down straight out of the cradle, replace knowledge with rhetoric, then throw them into the Frontline ranks of the leftist machine to get ground up the minute they no longer work for the machine. It's sad but our brothers and sisters were not blessed with deductive reasoning and the ability to question things. Those of us who have these qualities are rare, and it's us they wanna destroy most.</p>

Complaining on reddit or a group of psychos protesting lockdowns is not going to change anything - EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT.  None of us laypeople know ANYTHING about the virus, masks, etc etc... the only thing we do know is that as long as this virus is circulating, nothing will improve.

        <p>&rt;We're on the path to going back to "normal"</p>
<p>We would already be back normal if people like you could think for themselves.</p>
<p>&rt;EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT. None of us laypeople know ANYTHING about the virus, masks, etc etc...</p>
<p>Just because you don't know anything about viruses don't assume everyone else doesn't. It's honestly not surprising seeing you use that argument. I mean everyone is walking around in cheap spit masks thinking it's going to stop something 100x smaller than a single fiber of cotton. It literally says on the box it won't protect you from viruses.</p>
<p>&rt;Take one for the team, get the damn shot, and hope for the best like everyone else.</p>
<p>So inject an experimental modified virus to alter our genetics to save us from a virus? No one has any idea what the long-term effects could be. So your asking people to risk potentially having anything from a autoimmune disease to cancer in the future...to save themselves from what is basically comparable to the flu. I might as well play russian roulette while I'm at it too.</p>
<p>That's not trusting the science, that's anti-science and might as well be blind dogmatic faith.</p>
