    <strong>I moved. Anybody else move?</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone else moved? I moved for work, but also because I needed a break from increasingly lockdown-happy Alaska. The Republican governor there just extended the emergency orders and is advocating for cities to impose mask mandates. It shows that party affiliation only has so much to do with covid reaction. I now live in a state that is pretty lax about masks for the most part, and I feel slightly less frustrated. However, there are still mask nazis here, just like everywhere else.</p>
<p>Anybody else move? What has your experience been?</p>
<p>Edit: Here's an example of some of the bs in Anchorage. I don't/didn't live in Anchorage, but they're the economic hub of Alaska, and what's happening there, is hurting the state. </p>

        <p>Anchorage is a mess. They've had lockdowns on and off for awhile. The mayor who imposed the lockdowns just resigned due to a sex scandal. He was doing a bunch of shady things like closing down streets for businesses (so they could have outdoor dining) he had affiliations with and fining other businesses that had no space for outdoor dining for trying to stay open. </p>
<p>The mask stuff is pretty heavy in a lot of Alaska - even when it's not required by the city or state. Quite a few local businesses have put in mask mandates along with the big chain stores, and they have no problem with kicking out non-mask wearers. It was becoming harder and harder to find anywhere to shop. Oddly enough, however, almost nobody wears masks in restaurants. Shows that it's really about appearances and following ridiculous rules. </p>
<p>The governor was under a lot of criticism for cuts to the budget he made before covid. They had a bunch of petitions circulating to recall him. I kind of feel like he's bending under the covid stuff, for re-election purposes.</p>

        <p>Leaving IL for KS.  I'm hoping that the state legislature's override of the governor's mask mandate will stand if Sleepy Joe tries to push masks nationwide.  As long as KS keeps it county-by-county, I'm fine with driving the extra distance to shop and engage in society mask-free.</p>

        <p>It's tough, cause I'd like to move from Maine to a large city, but so many of them, even if the state itself has lax restrictions, are still pretty locked down.</p>
<p>I've also been waiting til after the election to choose a place because I wasn't looking to move to some city and then have my residence and place of work burned down, or some dumb shit. I also wanted to see exactly how cities/states are voting this election, and take it from there. There was always 2016's election data, but I definitely wanted to look at this year's.</p>
<p>So I'll look over the data and cities'/states' restrictions here this week and move from there, but am looking to move to a pretty red state that has warm winters and has a large city that isn't overwhelmingly blue - on top of needing the state and city itself to be mostly/almost all opened up.</p>

        <p>I happened to be in a Latin American country when the world suddenly spiralled into mass psychosis. This country implemented what was back then one of the most draconian lockdowns of the world, you couldn't leave your house but for two hours a week depending on your gender and passport digits. Without going into too much personal detail, I managed to leave this country eventually, which wasn't easy since they had shut down passenger air traffic completely, and returned to my central European home country in May.</p>
<p>Now while being back here in summer was a relief after the totalitarian central american bullshit, it has slowly become a creeping nightmare too, and it's far from over, its getting worse to the point where I am absolutely terrified of the government.</p>
<p>So I'm using a quasi business-esque excuse to once again leave Europe to go back to yet <em>another</em> Latin American country which now has <em>less</em> restrictions than my home country. That's what I have become, a Covid refugee, constantly on the run. </p>
<p>I've been dealing with flight cancellations and travel restrictions already, and I just pray that I'll make it out of Europe before the window closes entirely. That's how bad it is.</p>

        <p>Live in Georgia, go to college in Virginia. Before the flip, I was excited to head back to Georgia after I graduate. Maybe it'll still be free while we have Kemp, but who knows what Biden/Harris will try to pull nationally. And who knows what shenanigans will go on with the next gubernatorial. Still, now I'm looking for jobs in Oklahoma and South Dakota.</p>

        <p>I really want to and am refreshing job boards every day. Luckily my family is super supportive and havenâ€™t
even brought up virus stuff, they said if I find a job theyâ€™ll happily give me a little cash going away present but itâ€™s hard since a lot of the places where I can go, I canâ€™t personally visit beforehand without massive investment for flights and hotels and potential quarantines so Iâ€™m wondering how people who have moved have done it too.</p>
