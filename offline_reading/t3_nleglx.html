    <strong>They're Only Now Starting to Say This Came From a Lab</strong>
    <p><p>It has taken them over a fucking year for them to even entertain this theory. Something we all basically knew at the start of this and got called out as conspiracy theorists for. Of course this all comes out immediately after Fauci is questioned on funding gain of function research in Wuhan. Now, I have two questions for you:</p>
<p>Where's our apology?</p>
<p>How long before they start to question whether the vaccine is really safe or not?</p>
<p>Time and time AND TIME again we have been proven right about fucking everything. You have no idea how fucking pissed off it makes me fucking KNOWING you twats are going to turn around in a couple years time and say "aw yeah maybe lockdowns were bad" or "I was ALWAYS against lockdowns and knew this was a scamdemic!" </p>
<p>You'll probably end up deleting all your social media accounts as well to maintain the illusion. Fucking cowards.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;Where's our apology?</p>
<p>Seriously.  They owe us an apology.  We've been saying this all year, and they called us crazy.  Now, here we are.</p>
<p>Here's something to think about.  I'm sure this is happening in your family and circle of friends too.  Everyone is fighting.  Everyone is arguing.  <strong>And the blame for this falls squarely on these mother fuckers.</strong></p>
<p>Now, the "solution" to this problem which was created by corrupt, arrogant assholes, is to mass vaccinate as many people as possible.</p>
<p>They tell us we have to do this, to "get back to normal".</p>
<p>How about: Fuck you.</p>
<p>How about: The same people telling us we need to subject ourselves to an experimental pharmaceutical injection are the same people who created the virus.</p>
<p>We're all now fighting, and our society is being ripped apart, because of these mother fuckers.</p>
<p>This gives me even more incentive <em>not</em> to get vaccinated.  Why would I do the bidding of criminals?</p>
<p>Fuck these people.  Investigate it and tell the truth.  Show my family and friends who have all gone insane this past year this came from a lab.  Then I want an apology.</p>
<p>And no.  I'm not going to get an experimental injection because of your fuck up.</p>
<p>This is fucking ridiculous.</p>

        <p>&rt; We're all now fighting, and our society is being ripped apart, because of these mother fuckers.</p>
<p>It's not being ripped apart explicitly because of COVID - it's because the weak bugmen with the reddit-esque "soy gape" in urban areas ensure that a large contingent of their like-minded garbage humans are in power - think Stretchin' Gretchen, DeBlasio, Newsom, Lightfoot, Pelosi <em>et al</em> - and the way to keep these bugmen propping you up in power is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>make them principally useless consumers with marginal ability to take care of themselves</li>
<li>make them afraid of some thing </li>
<li>assure them that government is the solution to that thing</li>
</ul>
<p>In any other era, these "soft people" would have been serfs or not allowed to vote or simply wouldn't have existed because they're so weak, but in the modern era, we unfortunately give them a voice.</p>
<p>These "people" have risen in population strength and voice in the last half-century. I for one welcome the ripping-apart, so long as it results in a balkanization away from the urban areas and the baizuo.</p>

        <p>It's basically states (provinces in Canada) breaking off from each other and forming their own smaller nations.  </p>
<p>I believe it is inevitable, though in all likelihood, it is still quite a ways off. Decades, at the least, possibly even centuries. Although really, who knows at this point, with how much turmoil there is at present. The situation might be more tenuous than any of us realize.</p>

        <p>Ah yes. I believe this will happen too. In the US we have the convention of states moving along quite swiftly now. It’s a similar concept. The states have the legal right to band together and override/overthrow the federal government without the approval of Congress. </p>
<p>I believe many “brexit” type scenarios will continue to occur until we eventually have this Balkanization. I hope I live to see the day.</p>

<p>Dude, this is music to my ears. I've said so many time that that motherfucker Pueyo destroyed my extended family because my sisters went off the deep end because of him and his prognostications. I blame the fact that one of my sisters cancelled me directly on Fauci, Gates, Pueyo and the rest of the scum who road their broken cart into this dystopian hellscape we live in.</p>

        <p>I think it is because the USA is now in a stronger and more stable position than last year. An accusation of a lab leak will lead to expectations of actions and punishments on China... maybe even strengthen the global consensus against our rival.</p>
<p>By waiting until now to “admit” the lab leak, the USA will be in a much better position to make the next global chess moves...</p>

        <p>On second thought, I think the main reason for the timing is Trump.  If they had allowed the lab leak theory to be taken seriously, it would have majorly boosted Trump during the election.</p>

        <p>I hate to say it but everything in 2020; the virus, lockdown, the focus on death numbers...all of it felt like a way to guarantee Trump would not get re-elected and it’s crazy how quickly things went right back to the shit we’d been dealing with pre-Trump right after Biden was put in.</p>
<p>I’m no Trump fan but it really does feel like they burned down the country just to get him out and there’s not one atom of shame in anyone responsible.</p>
<p>It’s almost like they enjoyed punishing us for not doing what we were supposed to do and elect Hilary in 2016</p>

        <p>Remember when Fauci had those press releases at the beginning saying Trump and all the other experts were wrong for calling it the China flu. He strongly suggested that they were the liars. Quite seriously tho I was thinking while writing this,, has Fauci ever said one thing that was not a lie? Really other then what day it is.</p>

        <p>I've seen threads popping on r/conspiracy claiming that "finally" coming out about the manufactured virus is yet part of another plan of globalized confusion, and that one should be wary. To me it makes sense because I already was confused; and everything becomes plausible. Darn.</p>

        <p>Legitimate question, have you seen the CDC data from last year on excess deaths? There’s like 17k excess deaths a month on average in 2020 compared to 2019, and the death rate % per population increased. Is there an explanation for that, if covid didn’t exist?</p>

<p>Cmon, there really is nothing else you can attribute the deaths to? Nothing out of the ordinary happend in 2020, aside from the virus itself? Nothing that might have significantly impaired the average health?</p>

<p>Did you know that usually social interaction is great for your immun system? What happens when you deny your immun system to regularly get upgrades from your fellow peers?</p>
<p>How about the insanely intense and likely way over the top treatment of "covid" patients, based on fear and horrible publications? (especially the early ones)</p>

<p>And this is just top of my head. If I had more time, Id list more. Sincerely anyone who expected deathrates not to rise during this year, no matter if covid actually is a dangerous pathogene or a hoax, is optimistic at best.</p>

<p>Why couldnt it be, that doctors around the world used a shitty pcr-test that confirmed to them that they had Covid instead of Influenza, which then got severly misstreated?</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the propaganda did work on doctors too. I know one and she was shit scared before the pandemic even hit. She certainly wouldnt been in the right mind to figure out that she has done more harm than good.</p>

        <p>Well for one, when I got covid I lost my sense of smell along with like 50 people I know. Has that ever happened to anyone you know of with the common cold or a typical influenza? Why is it so hard to believe that this is a different virus especially when research is coming out that it’s even potentially genetically modified and leaked from a lab. It doesn’t mean it’s especially more deadly for a young person without comorbidities but it is more deadly for old people with pre-existing cardiovascular issues. </p>
<p>I agree that the PCR tests are inaccurate and lead to a crazy number of false positives but saying the virus is straight up fake is even too conspiratorial for me</p>

<p>??? Thats a very normal symptom for common colds and the typical influenza... jeez...</p>
<p>Btw. Im not saying there is no Covid. But, there has also been no argument that denies the possibility that there is in fact no Covid. At least I havent seen one, or at least not one that convinced me. So instead of calling it conspiratory (which btw. doesnt have to be the case, it could also been human mistakes leading up to it all) Id just call it a theory.</p>

        <p>Yeah it seems buried when I looked for it too. Do you not wonder why? Is it that maybe excess deaths tend to fluctuate from year to year such that if that data was known, 17000 would be within a normal deviation..?</p>

        <p>I would imagine that it’s buried because they don’t want people looking into it too much, yes. I wonder if it is within a normal deviation. I see counts from some other sites but not from CDC so I’m not citing it. If you find it let me know.</p>

        <p>Honestly with access to a printer you could have some fun with this.</p>
<p>Make a simple screenshot that shows a 2020 article calling the lab theory "baseless", alongside a May 2021 screenshot that calls the lab theory plausible. Make sure it's from the same outlet - IE, both are from CNN, CBC, whatever.</p>
<p>Print out like 50 of these, and attach them to every pole around the perimeter of said news outlet's HQ in your city. You just need some tape and maybe like an hour of your time. Do it with some friends after a few drinks. Bonus points if you print out 100 and go into residential areas.</p>
<p>Every person walking by, and every employee going into work, has to look at this. </p>
<p>If the volume is high enough, or some NPC gets assmad and posts it on Twitter, it <em>will</em> go viral because it's fucking hilarious and creative, and you can't ignore multiple city blocks of something taped to a post.</p>
<p>What 4Chan found with their It's OK to be White campaign is that paper campaigns are surprisingly effective. More people need to be doing this.</p>

        <p>If I've learned anything over the past year, it's that COVID conspiracy theorists are usually just right and 6+ months ahead of the MSM. Where's our apology? They won't give us one. They'll just memory hole everything like they always do. Vaccines? I'd say once the deaths on Vaers (deaths are 90% underreported) reach 10,000 maybe they'll pay attention. But then they'll just move on and never acknowledge that we were of course, right about everything.</p>

        <p>They're protecting Fauci with all of this and giving him time to formulate a defense. The fact is, it is <em>illegal</em> under US law to fund Gain of Function research of corona viruses. With the exception of "pressing or vital research critical to the safety of the United States." He used this loophole to fund the Wuhun Lab. So that begs the question.</p>
<p>Why would he need to investigate what his office was funding? His office was only LEGALLY allowed to fund coronavirus mode gain research because it was a PRESSING defence concern to the United States. </p>
<p>So either Tony boy is a liar, and he knows exactly what happened, or he is an incompetent buffoon who threw millions of taxpayer dollars to a lab in an adversary country with no idea of the benefits to the US. Which of course means that there was no pressing security need for the funding, and he still violated federal law.</p>

        <p>You have not been proven right. They still haven't actually demonstrated that Sars-Cov-2 exists outside of a computer generated genome. Gotta prove something exists before you can find out where it came from.</p>
<p>This is how they discovered "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

<p>You are correct. It could have come from nature. But to me the bigger issue is the fact that they told us it came from bats and that if we dared question that "fact" we were conspiracy nutjobs.</p>

        <p>You're right, the real question is whether any "virus" is pathogenic and if not then the whole vaccination paradigm is bunk. You are currently witnessing how powerful institutions can create a "global pandemic" with a "test" and you're not questioning anything else?</p>

        <p>I'm leaning more towards terrain theory as well, but I'm not ruling anything out. There's clearly a lot we don't know when it comes to biology or life in general, and it doesn't help that the accepted official paradigm is largely based on lies and deception.</p>

        <p>Not only will there NOT be an apology,</p>
<p>They will still see you as a Trump-supporting science denying piece of shit even if WHAT YOU SAID ENDED UP BEING TRUE.</p>
<p>They will STILL see you that way. Thats how effective this shit’s been. They have brainwashed people to be completely binary in their hatred.</p>

        <p>I don’t have much to add except to say that I’m right there with you. I’m fucking pissed. Been saying this came from a lab for an entire fucking year now, only to be called racist or anti-Asian or whatever. And of course, a ~CoNsPiRaCy ThEoRiSt.~ Fauci, the CCP, and all the cronies did this on purpose, and all these dumb fucks played right into their game. I’m trying hard to remember that the real enemy is those in power, but goddamn it’s tough not to blame the brainwashed mass of cucks begging daddy government to take their rights away and telling us to die because we won’t take the jab. They’re almost just as bad at this point. I’m just fucking pissed, I’m done.</p>

        <p>I think malicious intent at the lab seems unlikely and the release was probably an accident. However, China keeping international travel open when locking down domestic travel seems like an intentional effort to infect the world so that China's economy would stay as number 1.</p>

        <p>The only reason the lockdowns weren't as effective was because of all the people who refused to actually social distance and stay at home. Lab or not, the real issues resulted from too many self centered people who couldn't give up social interaction to save the lives of others to stop the spread of a deadly disease, resulting in much longer than necessary lockdowns and the requirement of mass vaccination</p>

        <p>COVID spreads much more rapidly and it's still spreading. IIRC it's been recently confirmed to spread via airborne particles. I also doubt that the flu has been completely eradicated. There are too many individuals not taking the pandemic seriously enough to sufficiently stop the spread of such an infectious disease. I can't speak for everyone everywhere but it's pretty obvious around where I live that a lot of people did not take the lockdowns or mask mandates seriously. Many of my friends and family who did not take it seriously got sick and some passed away.</p>

<p>Yeah because potential evidence has actually surfaced lol. And even still, exactly as you said, its a theory that only warrants further investigation.</p>

<p>&rt;We have documented in recent decades that obesity is NOT due to lack of exercise nor not eating healthy. It is due to GENETICS and no one can fight their genetics.</p>
