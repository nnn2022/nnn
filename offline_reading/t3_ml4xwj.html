        <p>And he did a VERY SIGNIFICANT followup too big to screencap</p>
<p>&rt;It's hilarious reading the comments on my previous thread... So many of you seem to think I operate in a vacuum, the truth is, that could not be further from reality.  First, we have a team, an awesome team.  Second... I have been in this movement for a year... an "organizer" for over eleven months.... I have had a birdseye view of the movement.  I follow all the players, and people reach out all the time.  Some of the folks that reach out have been organizers in their own communities.  People get a protest up and running and then have to run the gauntlet of all of these grifters and shills continuously trying to ride coattails and freeload on those who have actually put in real effort... If they are prevented from doing so, then begins the backstabbing and spreading of lies.  My first real experience with this was from "The Line". They formed seemingly out of nothing, along with a few other groups... immediately they started reaching out across the country trying to unite the groups... We felt something was off about them right out of the gate.  Especially with Boutros Tanios.... their main guy.... Who uses at least 6 different aliases and hides in the background... When we wouldn't "play ball" all of the sudden there were several different posters produced each week all advertising a different location for competing rallies... of course these came from Toronto and Vancouver and had no local backing.  Nobody even went, but it was confusing.  Then the flags started showing up.... Soon every protest across the country looked as if it were organized by "The Line," even though they did nothing other than sell merch to an unsuspecting public.  VERY CLEVER....  Finally, when the video of Lamont surfaced essentially sympathizing with pedophiles, I drew THE LINE.... and requested that group signs or emblems no longer be brought to our protest.  Unify the People also had a big role in us making that decision.... They would insist that their signs, advertising nothing other than their website be front and centre in front of my livestream.... Unify the People has NOTHING to do with ending any of these restrictions and is only interested in advertising their ill thought out political ambitions.... Their hateful rhetoric, and bigoted ideas are not welcome or needed at our rallies, and we don't want to be associated with or give them a platform.... This really ticked off the likes of Jeff Sharpe, Nicky Hurley, and others, who have decided to make life as difficult for us as possible.  Jeff Sharpe is a former Yellow Vester, who is partly to blame for the self destruction of that movement... apparently destroying one movement isn't good enough for him!<br>
Now we are seeing the same thing all over again, it is a repeat of last year!  Now, instead of The Line invading every protest across the country it is Hugs Over Masks, following the exact same playbook.  When you start to dig into the people behind Hugs Over Masks, you will find that they are deeply connected to the same people at The Line...  Kelly Anne Wolfe was a founder of The Line, and is on the board of Hugs Over Masks..... Hugs also formed a spinoff group called We Are All Essential.... Which collected names of businesses that were going to open in defiance of the restrictions... Unfortunately NONE of those businesses ever actually opened, and all the health inspectors had a nice list of all the businesses that were thinking about breaking the rules.  We all know that "The Line" went full on sovereign citizen under the guidance of Christopher James, of A Warrior Calls.  This was another problem we had at our rallies... devotees of the Warrior Calls cult were insisting on spreading their pseudo legal common law bull crap at our rallies.... We put an end to it... Funny enough, "The Line's" relationship with Chris James ended rather quickly as "The Line" completely imploded and lost its influence.  I've had my suspicions about Vlad for sometime now, but he is a hard one to put your finger on.... I loved the Hugs Over Masks branding and message!!!  It was fantastic.... but he seemed to be awfully close to all of the people that were causing us problems.... It was not until they formed "We are all essential" that the truth was revealed... certainly not in public, but behind the scenes.  We are all essential, while promising to help businesses stay open, was really all about disseminating Common Law misinformation... Don't get me wrong.... I know that common law is a real thing, but what they are pushing is anything but common law, and is in fact sovereign citizen ideology.  <br>
This is where Adam Skelly fits in.... he raised $300k, for his legal defence after his restaurant was raided.  He has admitted on A Warrior Calls, that he intends to lose his court case deliberately, he has instructed his counsel to ignore a defence that might have a chance, and ordered them to fight on constitutional grounds, that is guaranteed to fail, specifically for the purpose of sparking an insurrection that he hopes will lead to a much larger uprising.  When I hear that, I think civil war.... These people believe that it is within their rights to set up their own courts, with their own judges, their own police, their own bailiffs.  They feel that this is the answer... Of course what they ignore is the reality that none of our current system is just going to disappear as they like to claim!  The police will not step aside... The judges are not going to give up their cushy jobs!!! So what then???? Civil war???   Is that what you want??? It's not what I want. Also interesting to note, is that Adam Skelly donated $1000 to Scarlet of the Leduc Lanes, and then canceled the payment... No idea why... You'd think coming from a wealthy family and getting $300k for free he could at least honour his word.... but no.</p>
<p>&rt;We are all well aware by now that the Walk for Freedom group of Calgary is totally committed to the proliferation of this sovereign citizen ideology, by their repeated telecasts of Christopher James at their protests.  Could this be the reason the police have been so heavy handed in all of the cities where these grifters and schemers appear??  Seems quite likely to me.  The police HATE sovereign citizen types, and with good reason.</p>
<p>&rt;The last group I will mention here today, is The Myth is Canada, one of the many groups that has Kelly Anne Wolfe's name all over it.... This group is a break-off of Unify The People.  They have similar beliefs, they fall into a category called the "New Constitutionalists," which in and of itself is not something I have a problem with.... but they also believe that Canada does not exist!!!  Since Canada does not exist, and in their minds is nothing more than a "Service Corporation" we have now come full circle and are back in Sovereign Citizen territory!  So why is Kelly Anne on the board or heavily connected to every one of these groups??? Do you really want your anti-lockdown protests being controlled by such a small group of people, who despite their continuous pleas for "unity," are in actuality the biggest source of disunity across the movement!??  Why is nobody allowed to have an independent protest free of their influence??? Why is it that any time anyone tries to work outside of their groups they are attacked and vilified?   Why is Kevin J. Johnston even in Calgary??? Would Calgary really be stupid enough to vote  him in as mayor??? I highly doubt it.  Why are any of these people even in Alberta right now???   Shouldn't they be holding down the fort at home??? Or is it because they are no longer welcome in Toronto?  Perhaps their grifting has worn thin at home???
Apologies for the long post... I could write a book on this, maybe some day I will... Unfortunately, Facebook is not an ideal platform for this type of discussion.  Hopefully this abbreviated explanation will help some of you to understand where we are coming from.... I will continue on regardless.  This is not my first rodeo with these people, and it won't be the last... unless the people wake up to their schemes and quit supporting this garbage!</p>

        <p>This happens in the US too.  The Capitol "takeover" that got any questioning of our totally free and fair election branded as insurrection was the work of these types, just for a start.</p>
