    <strong>In-person schooling has become just as ridiculous</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a junior who goes to a public school in a state that thankfully decided to reopen schools this year. We have to wear masks ALL day, can't talk to anyone in class unless we're answering a question, and the teachers seem to have completely given up on teaching anything. They're all pissed off that they have to be there in person and are "protesting" by doing the bare minimum and only handing out confusing worksheets with no instruction or explanation. They only allow four people to a lunch table so a bunch of kids have to eat in the gym or on the floor. It's a disaster.</p>
<p>Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, two students tested positive for the virus so the school unleashed a bunch of new ridiculous rules and protocols. One of them is that we have to wash our hands and face AND use sanitizer before entering a new classroom. We have 6 periods and lunch so we have to do this 7 times a day now. They also made a new rule banning students and even staff from wearing makeup because it makes washing the face harder or something? I'm a guy so this didn't really affect me but I had to hear all my female teachers complaining about how the rule is sexist and whatnot. They got more worked up about not having makeup on than they did when 90% of the class failed a quiz. It's just all so stupid and destructive. Nobody is happy about this and even the doomers are getting fed up. When will this end?</p></p>

        <p>Teachers are some of the whiniest people on earth, they want parades for themselves for working 9 months out of the year, they think of themselves as heroes, they wanted to be some of the first people furloughed, they complained about the possibility of having their summer cut to make up time and they’re bitching about coming back. </p>
<p>They’re heroes? You know how many copies of spider man would sell if instead of helping people he complained about having to do work and take time away from posting anti trump memes on Facebook?</p>

        <p>Has the school done independent testing of the hand sanitizer that they require students to use? The CDC has put out a warning that many sanitizers contain unlabelled methanol, which can be deadly.</p>
<p>Many teens use prescription acne medication that is applied once or twice a day following face washing. Forcing students to wash their faces at school would interfere with doctors' instructions.</p>

        <p>Methanol is poisonous if ingested, the small amount that is contaminating the hand sanitizers would not kill him. It’s not good that it’s a contaminate, but not going to kill anyone in normal use.</p>

        <p>Yes, the dose makes the poison, and you don’t really want to be putting methanol on your hands everyday. The FDA recalled them, so it’s unlikely OP is using them. </p>
<p>Methanol contamination of isopropyl alcohol (and vice versa) was an issue I had at my first job. While it was problematic, the amount of MeOH in my IPA was barely detectable on the instrument I was using. I could be wrong on the hand sanitizer, but I imagine it is a similar situation. The amount is above detection limits but they didn’t use MeOH instead of EtOH. They used the wrong grade of EtOH. 
Which unless ingested, probably won’t cause harm from the short time it was on the market.</p>

        <p>It's a hysteria now. I will never end. Teachers especially will be leveraging this until the end of time, because more than any other group it seems to be in their nature.</p>
<p>I think everyone who can should go on strike against the public education system in its current state. That's a separate rant. I think groups of families need to hire underemployed educated people with a bachelors degree and have them teach their kids the 3Rs. Community-driven. Paid by the families, in kind where possible.</p>

        <p>question:</p>
<p>why are you even still going there?</p>
<p>you clearly are not learning anything and it should be easy to understand, that any degree is quite meaningless in coming years, if things keep going as they are directed by traitor governments.</p>
<p>so why not stay at home, where no one is trying to force a harmful mask, that has 0 benefit on u?</p>
<p>i mean hell do an hour of research  on some interesting ancient history stuff, an hour of research of what a scam this whole shit show is with harmful useless masks, destructive lockdowns, that already kill tons of people and it will only get worse as deaths of despair will shoot rocket high and then spend another 2 hours doing some art or some sport or whatever.</p>
<p>you're having a lot more fun, you are actually learning something and your not getting tortured. those measures in school are by definition torture.</p>
<p>are you still to young, to just not go to this bullshit anymore? (being a junior is not a common phrase here and we got a different system here and i don't know the age of juniors)</p>
<p>i mean if that is the case, then tell your parents to write some bullshit, that you won't be dealing with those insane measures and will be homeschooled until they are gone.</p>
<p>also ad 2 hours of video games or whatever else  to the at home education plan and call it "don't get insane relaxing part".</p>
<p>i mean no one should send their parents to schools, where they are getting pushed to wear slave muzzles.</p>
<p>also i feel for you. i'm sorry, that you go through this and you are not alone in  wanting your freedoms back.</p>

        <p>I signed up for in person school because I thought it would still be pretty close to how it was before the lockdown. I had no idea how bad things would be and didn't want to spend all year locked up in my room trying to figure out e-learning. From what I've heard all the options suck this year. My friends who are staying home say online learning is basically all busywork and the teachers don't even explain what work they have to turn in. It's all a mess.</p>

        <p>My youngest daughter benefited from this current situation by doing this, sort of. </p>
<p>She was supposed to graduate in June 2019, but was undisciplined and lazy, so she failed most of her subjects in the final term and the school wouldn't let her graduate. So she got a job and went to work, still somewhat unmotivated to complete her education. By winter, she was looking into getting her GED, but didn't have the money for the test, and didn't know what she wanted to do with her life, so she blew it off.</p>
<p>Enter COVID shutdowns and her stimulus check. She told me that she wanted to schedule the test and I told her to look online for a practice test, so she'd know it wouldn't be money and time wasted if she couldn't pass. Well, whaddaya know: our state partnered with an online testing site to allow people to take their tests at home (monitored, of course) if they used that site and passed the practice test.</p>
<p>She passed and applied to a local university and they accepted her without SAT/ACT scores, since many high schools couldn't get their kids those tests this spring. That school mandated its freshmen to live on-campus, even though classes were online, so she's a college girl now!</p>

        <p>i mean i would just not do any of this.</p>
<p>maybe going back to e-learning and just not doing any of it would be the healthier option for you both physically and mentally and emotionally.</p>
<p>i mean you're not learning anything anymore, so might as well spend your time better.</p>
<p>an idea, that might be nice to help with the huge stress and shit from all this insanity and isolation could be, to meet with the people, that do e-learning in person and actually learn something together for an hour or 2. finding a topic, that you all enjoy and discuss stuff about it. a bit of learning, discussion, distraction and human contact without insanity around it.</p>
<p>well, that is assuming, that those people have realized, that all of this fakedemic is basically bullshit.</p>
<p>either way, just please don't torture yourself for meaningless public school, that now got even FAR FAR FAR worse.</p>
<p>if you won't step away now, then maybe remember this in 2 weeks, and just call it a day then.</p>

        <p>So sorry you're dealing with this but thank you for sharing. Confirms what I told everyone at the start of the year: if schools are going to be enforcing all these stupid ass pointless protocols and torturing the kids all day then fuck it. Just keep the damn kids home where at least they can be comfortable while they're not learning anything. Agree with others: your folks should take a stand and pull you out if that school. It's doing you more harm than good.</p>
<p>I won't send my son back until school is all the way open with no dumbass restrictions. Given the direction our public schools are going he's probably better off learning at home with me anyway COVID or no COVID.</p>

        <p>Unless you're planning on getting into a top tier college, formally withdraw from school and get your GED. There are usually a lot of college scholarships for people who get their GED to encourage older people to go back to school. School's going to be a shitshow this year anyway, certainly not worth the time vs other options that are available.</p>

        <p>Parent of an 8th grader who is doing school online. STOP going into that concentration camp. Today. Talk to your parents. Explain to them how it is hurting you. I would NEVER send my son into that atmosphere. It's torture and will have longterm effects mentally and physically. Sure online school sucks. But he's at home, safe, not being shuffled around all day like an animal. Homeschooling is the direction we're seriously considering. I'm doing my research and hoping we can find a group. Kids need socialization. His friends already told him there's NO WAY they can get together until this "...Corona thing is over, BRO!" Well, there you go, brainwashing complete.</p>

        <p>All this insanity for kids in schools, yet on Monday I had dinner with family in a restaurant where easily 75-100 people were all eating and chatting without masks (except on their way to the table, that's the trick to outfoxing the Rona!) and nobody was concerned.</p>
<p>Was able to peek back into the kitchen and the whole kitchen staff had their masks under their chins.  It's all such BS.  The silver lining may be that it will redpill a generation of youths that the government truly has no idea what it's doing.</p>

        <p>This is insane. My wife’s school in a rural county is taking reasonable precautions, like mandatory hand wash or sanitizer any time students come into a new class, and lunch in shifts so there’s fewer people crammed into the cafeteria (which is still probably unnecessary, but makes sense since they probably should have already been doing that). None of the kids wear masks. Few of the teachers do. There’s no rule about talking and there’s a rule about desk spacing but no one follows it because it would be literally impossible to with the number of students in each class. </p>
<p>With all of this, there has been two cases. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were false positives, either, since apparently they were asymptomatic. Otherwise, everything is fine and normal. This is a high school with about 1000 kids. Even I was expecting more cases than this. </p>
<p>It really proves to me, without a doubt, that this whole thing has been a hoax. My wife was on the fence but now that she’s been there a month and nothing happened even with minimal protocol, she is going further than I am and saying that the virus isn’t even real. I definitely think it’s real but the alarmism is entirely manufactured.</p>

        <p>Is it real?  Possibly.  We really just have no proof at this point that it’s “novel” and I think that’s the main concern.  These PCR tests looking for RNA remnants isn’t even a valid way to detect a virus.  If this were last year before any talk of any of this there would be zero alarm bells being raised by medical personnel.</p>

        <p>I read the whole article. It bothers me that it's not objective, it's obviously biased.</p>
<p>But, they make good points. The PCR test has a lot of false positives and false negatives. It's not a good test for asymptomatic people because we don't know if they actually expell the virus.</p>
<p>The problem is, what do these people dying in hospitals actually have? I mean, there are patients that doctors just take a look at and know it's COVID. There are specific findings in other tests that give this disease a high probability of being the cause.</p>
<p>Maybe there are way less cases than we think there are. But hospitals were full in NY of people with this disease.</p>

        <p>At my school (during the small periods of time we were actually there, we've been in distance learning for literally half the year), you had to get your temperature checked every morning before entering the school. You had to physically distance at all times, and - of course - wear a mask. There was hand sanitizer stationed outside every classroom and we were expected to sanitize our hands when entering and exiting the classroom. We were also expected to wipe down the tables and chairs with special wipes before going to our next class. The classrooms were all rearranged so that the desks were 1.5 m apart. Each year level was allocated a different area of the school to be able to spend time in at lunch. Kitchen + microwaves were not allowed to be use, the cafeteria was closed.</p>

        <p>Florida has opened schools this year, but the experience is almost exactly as your state is. In Orange County, we have mandatory masks all day, with "mask breaks". Students aren't allowed to come six feet from one another, let alone wave or talk to each other. Movement has been impeded strictly via one way hallways and stairwells. Lots of doors have been installed in places there was only a doorway.  Water fountains are blocked off and bathrooms have capacity rules now. Some kids at another high school on the west side of town tested positive and the school has been shuttered for two weeks. This was not because of the school, but a birthday party in August with about 13 kids.</p>

        <p>This is typical work for a public union. The Chicago teachers figured this out long ago. They are top paid in the nation, with some of lowest test scores for this reason. Do not support local public unions.</p>

        <p>that is horrible. it must be so hard to be a kid in this lockdown with all of these doomers telling you what to do. do you know how many people the virus kills? 4%. thats basically nothing. the doomers just want something to talk about. this virus is a btech ebola and kills basically nobody. if i were you, i would just find a school that is ran by normal people instead of a doomer school</p>

<p>-girls to submit to genital mutilation at a certain age, let’s say 12</p>
<p>-unmarried women to refrain from buying a house in only their name</p>

        <p>Would you say that some rules, in the history of rules, were seen by many people (especially but not exclusive to the people who invented and enforced them) as <em>not</em> harmful, but rather helpful?</p>
<p>Rules typically aren’t advertised as harmful, right? I’ve never seen rules - even harmful ones - advertised as harmful as they are being enforced.</p>
<p>But then in the lens of history, it turns out they were quite harmful. In the lens of history, it turns out they were inhumane. They weren’t helping society, they were hurting it.</p>
<p>Would you agree that rules that turned out to be seen as inhumane were initially (and forcefully!) purported to be for the good of society?</p>

        <p>Okay, but one more question: if you witnessed those rules being enforced - those rules that hurt people - what would you do?</p>
<p>Would you go along, because the government, and the media, and some really angry redditors, said you should? And that if you didn’t, you were part of the problem? And you were bad, and disobedient, and didn’t care about society?</p>
<p>Just pick one of my examples and tell me what you would do if you saw it being enforced.</p>
<p>Would you question it? It’s okay to say you wouldn’t. It’s okay to know yourself that well and be honest. And this is unrelated to the pieces of cloth thing, you’re right.</p>

        <p>Don't be surprised if you can't drill down to their logic core and get a decent answer.  Some folks are too proud to ever concede faulty reasoning to someone they deem an "opponent".  But there is hope, maybe they'll have a moment of reflection while they're alone, and reach a turning point.</p>
