    <strong>Masks aren't going anywhere even if you get the COVID vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>From the article:  <em>Medical experts</em> <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/shopping/article/bayarea/article/Do-I-need-to-wear-mask-after-getting-COVID-vaccine-15788970.php"><em>don’t yet know if the vaccines prevent COVID infections or just its symptoms</em></a><em>. If it’s the latter, vaccinated individuals may still be able to contract and spread the illness as asymptomatic carriers, making them an unwitting danger. More than</em> <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/shopping/article/shopping/article/CDC-increased-mask-recommendations-again-15781997.php"><em>50% of infections</em></a> <em>come from people unaware that they're infected, and continuing to wear masks</em> <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/shopping/article/shopping/article/CDC-increased-mask-recommendations-again-15781997.php"><em>mitigates that danger</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Here go the goalposts again.  Now it's not just people who don't wear masks who we're supposed to fear.  It's not just people who do wear masks but are asymptomatic spreaders.  It's not just mask-wearing asymptomatic spreaders who don't get vaccinated.  Now it's vaccinated asymptomatic spreaders.  Literally WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE GODDAMNED VACCINE? It's never going to be safe to go outside ever.</p></p>
