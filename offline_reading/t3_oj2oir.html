    <strong>The hysteria is the point</strong>
    <p><p>All this time, we've wondered what is going on. </p>
<p>Many free thinkers can see through the fake narratives. We know it's not about saving lives (there are so many other ways we could do this). We know the testing, the masks, and the vaccines have questionable value. We know the media has played with statistics and stories. We know the real, immediate cost of life, wealth, and liberty it has had on millions if not billions of lives around the world. We know the oligarchy has been spared these effects â€” in fact, they grew significantly wealthier.</p>
<p>Anyway, I want to redirect the energy of the anger a bit. We're too focused on finding something to have the opposite effect (eg we're told it is good for us, but it's actually bad for us). In many cases, this might be true. However, we can't have that assumption. And secondly, I think it misses the point of why COVID is such a <em>thing</em> (why has the past year and a half played out the way it has?).</p>
<p>The answer is that it is a distraction. It is hysteria. Just like the left and the right in politics, while everyone is arguing about completely irrelevant bullshit or with completely incorrect assumptions, the <em>real</em> stuff is going down. Real moves are being made behind the scenes.</p>
<p>They want people to be true believers (eg the ones who brag about their "Fauci Ouchie") AND conspiratorial nutjobs that think they are injecting microchips or that 5G towers are the real killers, along with many other more realistic but still false conspiracies. This is called a strategy of tension; and a strategy of tension over information is called disinformation or psyop. I don't claim to know exactly what is real with all of this, science-wise, as I am not a molecular biologist. However, I can still reason around the edges of that because this is obviously a <em>hysteria</em>. There is absolutely nothing open for popular debate, and that's a clue that this was synthetically forced upon us.</p>
<p>And do you know why they do this? Why do they create hysteria? Why are they able to do things behind the scenes that we can't see? Simply put, we don't react fast enough. In battle, each and every person or unit has an inflow of information, a period to process and decide upon it, and then a period of action. As general doctrine goes, the ability to cycle through this more quickly is how you are able to get a leg up on the enemy. It was as true for John Boyd piloting his F-86 in the Korean War as it is for American citizens now, who are in a war against the oligarchy that seeks to control it. They are maneuvering on us while we are in hysteria.</p>
<p>I can't promise that everything will be better, but simply by knowing this, we can fight it by attempting to react faster, to think more broadly, to be on the look out for disinformation (pro and against), to not react to provocateurs, and to be aware who the real enemies are (no, not the <em>other</em> side).</p>
<p>Do you remember when 9/11 happened? Everyone wanted to focus on the good guys and the bad guys. Who did it? Well, it was the Muslim extremists obviously. Let's go get them. Then, several years later, we learn that we are stuck in this unwinnable war in Asia. We keep fighting it though, of course, with little reminders of who the 'good guys' and 'bad guys'. A few more years go by, and we start learning about who is funding who, who <em>founded</em> which groups. Dig a little farther, and you find out financial interests <em>in America</em> that wanted those towers to go down. And yes, the entire circumstances of those towers collapsing are bizarre and don't match scientific reasoning, but that is also like arguing about vaccines and masks right now. 9/11 was ultimately a <em>distraction</em> that allowed the PATRIOT Act to pass, the Afghan and Iraq wars, Big Oil to get rich, organized crime to funnel drugs and money through the region, etc. We couldn't stop any of this, let alone see it before it happened, because we were distracted</p>
<p>Let this be a reminder for those of who try to make maybe a bit too much sense of the daily events right now.</p>

        <p>They can't give us too much of a lull in the madness to sit there and mull over what's happening. They also can't chill the constant barrage of divisive and instigating news headlines. It all keeps us anxious, depressed, angry, and ultimately distracted. While we're over here flinging our own shit at each other they nonchalantly chip away at our rights and wealth, and insist that the other man did it.</p>

        <p>It's not a distraction, the vaxxes are a key focus and the whole scamdemic was created to coerce into these things. </p>
<p>They either are or will be used to usher in the mark of the beast.</p>
