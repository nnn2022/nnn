        <p>This implies politicians were good hearted people who try to solve a real problem but simply fail or are a bit stupid. </p>
<p>This is utterly ridiculous, they are obvious psychopaths who will e.g. send armed thugs to cage you if you have the wrong color of plants in your cigarette according to them, or if you don't pay them what they want to extort from you. </p>
<p>They are literally enslaving you, so this meme is complete and utter garbage because it implies they were your friend, when the scum is obviously your worst enemy.</p>

<p>Before lockdowns: infection rates skyrocketing exponentially!</p>

        <p>Right, I don't deny the negatives of lockdown. You're moral system seems to be based on a utilitarian perspective, in that you way the total pain of lockdown vs the total pain of no lockdown. (I think that's the definition of lockdown, anyways. Correct me if I'm wrong)</p>
<p>So, using this method you've come to the conclusion that lockdown, while beneficial to infection rates, has more downsides than benefits. Right?</p>
<p>(BTW, I also agree with weighing the pros and cons of every situation)</p>

        <p>Yes.  And more years of life lost. Suicides, drug overdoses, and other deaths of despair hit the younger.  The vast majority that are dying of COVID are older with co-morbidities with fewer years left.</p>
<p>And there is no evidence that the effect of the lockdowns are permanent.  Everywhere that has had them has has varying success in delaying the spread. When they eventually open up the spread comes back and heavily.  Look at California right now.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions like NZ and Australia.  But they are islands, isolated from other countries.  Lower population than many countries. They were able to catch it with very few cases.  And importantly the virus arrived in their summertime, when viral transmission is low and much easier to control. </p>
<p>Even those countries it's questionable if long term the strategy will be beneficial as they will eventually need to open their borders and economies.  It will be based on vaccine efficacy which many of the effects such as lowering transmission and lowering mortality were not tested in the trials so there is still some doubt there.</p>

        <p>Well, we got the virus in the summer, too. With only two neighbors (covid rates aren't necessarily higher on the borders, either). We knew about covid in the US really early, too.</p>
<p>I would also argue that the point of lockdown wasn't ever to do it indefinitely. The point was to do it until we found a vaccine.</p>
<p>But anyways, to get back to your pros and cons, when we are making decisions about nation wide policy, it should only be taken seriously if it's based on available data. Have you actually looked at the rise in non-covid deaths vs rise in covid deaths? To compare them?</p>

        <p>1/3 of all excess deaths in the US are non COVID deaths.  The problem is the impact of the lockdowns will continue for years to come.  A statistician in Bristol UK has put long term lockdown cost for the UK at 556,000 lives, about 9 times the current deaths for COVID in that country.</p>
<p>The virus didn't arrive to the US in the summer.  It arrived during flu season BTW.  It was thought that it hit in February, but there are some that think it arrived earlier.</p>
<p>Islands can control entry and exits my easier than nations with land border.  It makes lockdowns a lot easier.</p>

<p>Comparing "long term lockdown cost" to "current covid deaths" seems dishonest to me. Do you have the info for long term UK covid deaths?</p>

        <p>Why would total effect of your actions.be dishonest?  You absolutely need to take that into consideration.  Let's just take child abuse for example.  That has generational effects.  Having your grandma die at 83 will be tough but it's something almost everyone had to face.  Overcoming your mom or dad beating you because they are stressed about not being able.to work or worries about their income takes ages ro overcome.
 The other effects of poverty will accumulate while the economy recovers which doesn't appear to be for a while.</p>
<p>https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/is-the-cost-of-another-lockdown-too-high-</p>
<p>&rt;Now, this might not sound a great deal on first hearing, but when it is multiplied by Britain’s population of 67 million (because Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are following similar medical and epidemiological advice), the number of average lives lost comes to 560,000</p>
<p>As far as borders go, you can turn off flights and boats rather easily.  Patrolling a whole border for all illegal crossers can be difficult hard.</p>
