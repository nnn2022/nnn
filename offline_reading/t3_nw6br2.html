    <strong>COVID-19/Vaccine Primer (an ELI in high school crash course) AKA why the vaccines are causing issues</strong>
    <p><p>Hey there all of you - I noticed that across the world both sides (doomer and critical thinker) share a lot of anxiety about covid. This post is directed at the critical thinkers in this sub who have intellectual curiosity who want to actually understand what is going on but have a hard time reading some of these scientific papers, hopefully by the end of this post you will have a better understanding of the basics of COVID19, the mRNA vaccines, how they function, and why it may be wise to hold off on the vaccines for now. </p>
<p>For the sake of time and brevity, this post will ONLY discuss the infection vector of covid19, its relevance to the vaccines and why the infection vector itself causes the majority of the symptoms of covid. This post is aimed at a high school education to help broaden understanding, and because of that I may gloss over or simplify some things for the sake of understanding of a very complex process, but if you identify a glaring error, please do feel free to correct me :) </p>
<p>Ok so lets start:</p>
<p>Covid-19 is a coronavirus, so named historically because of its original appearance in its first images. There are countless coronaviruses out there, but only a few that we know of that infect the human body, SARS and MERS are two other examples, but there are others that only have numeric identities and are typically related to what we might call the common cold. Each "point" of the main "crown" (corona) feature of the virus is composed of receptor binding proteins (also called the spike proteins), which means that it is the part that attaches to the cell, allows it to insert itself into the cell, build copies of itself, and ultimately infect other cells. But how does it actually get inside the cell?</p>
<p>In covid19 the virus spike is actually genetically composed of two proteins in literature called S1 and S2, and they each serve a different function. The S1 protein is the very tip of the spike, and its shape is such that it fits into, or rather a better way to put it, is attracted to, the ACE2 receptor of the cell. We will get to the ACE2 receptor shortly, as it is a main reason for the pathogenic nature of the virus. There is a specific part of the S1 genetic sequence called the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) that codes for what is known as the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM), you can think of the RBM as the specific part that fits into the ACE2 receptor just right, like a puzzle piece, that once that takes place allows the S2 portion of the protein merge the cell and the virus, both by helping to drive passage into the cell and simultaneously cutting the protective protein shell of the coronavirus (fancy scientists call this lysing of the viral protein shell) so that the virus can spill its RNA into the host cell. </p>
<p>By the way, one good way to think about these puzzle pieces is to imagine a set of complex puzzle pieces built out of magnets, some facing one way, others facing another, but still all bound together (as a protein) and flexible. When the magnets get close to a matching piece (like the ace2 receptor) they are attacted to, and connect with that receptor (this is also why you can have proteins that partially/weakly bind with one another). This action of connecting causes both pieces to change shape, because now some parts have larger combined magnets, other parts are attracted but may not touch, while even other parts may be repulsed... this is generally a good way to think about cellular receptor interactions. </p>
<p>Now, I mentioned previously about the ACE2 receptor and how it is related to the symptoms of covid. Well, it all comes down to a hormone in the human body called Angiotensin, and in fact, ACE2 stands for <strong>A</strong>ngiotensin <strong>C</strong>onverting <strong>E</strong>nzyme (type <strong>2</strong>) and it is responsible for converting a version of Angiotensin (known as Angiotensin 2 - original I know) into Angiotensin(1-7). </p>
<p>So what does Angiotensin actually do? Well, it actually serves a few purposes in the body, but it is very well known for vasoconstriction (making vessels smaller diameter) and vasodilation (making vessels larger) depending on the state that it is in. In fact this hormone is part of a whole system called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renin%E2%80%93angiotensin_system">Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)</a>. Well, it just so happens that Angiotensin 2 (Ang2) is the vasoconstrictor form of that hormone, and since the covid spike protein competes for the ACE2 receptor, and only so many exist on the outside of the cells at any given time, excess Ang2 builds up in localized areas (because only one part of the system is broken, the ace2 receptor which should be converting Ang2 to Ang(1-7) ) - this is why they say that covid is not a respiratory disease but rather a vascular one. Its not that it is clogging your lungs, its actually causing the very tiny capillaries in the aveoli of the lung to constrict so much that blood flow is no longer possible, effectively shutting down parts of the lung. </p>
<p>So many of the major symptoms are explainable just from this one effect: headaches, hypertension and other heart problems, cloudy head (reduced bloodflow in the brain), low O2 saturation (we just discussed), just to name a few. But like I said this system has a variety of purposes throughout the body, including major functionality in the reproductive systems of both male and female humans, specifically in hormone regulation. Also, when you hear about doctors using steroids to treat patients with covid, they are mostly discussing vasodilators to re-enable bloodflow. </p>
<p>Now, the issue with the vaccine is that it creates these spike proteins, using mRNA delivery vehicles to go into the cells, manufacture this part of the virus, and direct the body to generate an immune response. It was originally expected that these spike proteins would be injected into an area that should prevent the spike proteins from getting too far (muscle mass with few blood vessels, and very little ace2 expression - thus the deltoid). Then they would be expressed and transported to the outside of the cell, the cell would then be killed by the innate immune system (freeing the proteins), and transported by the lymphatic system to the lymph nodes where antibodies would be created. It's really important that the injection doesn't go into the blood stream as it would basically trigger the major symptoms of covid. </p>
<p>But heres the catch, whether from human error during injection, a misunderstanding of the human body, or possibly the inevitability that there must be an amount of mRNA that gets into the blood stream no matter what, we are experiencing significant side effects since, the spike protein, even without the virus will still attach to the ace2 receptor, and thus render it useless (and then allow ang2 to build up). In fact, it would likely be quite dangerous if this vaccine if it were injected directly into a vein. It is likely that some people experience very mild effects when the injection goes exactly as planned, and more severe effects when more of the mrna is getting into the blood (allowing the effects of the spike to happen throughout the body) -- specifically it is probably unwise to pinch the deltoid while you inject it, because the entirety of the injection needs to get into the dense muscle tissue to prevent the spike from running around in the blood stream.</p>
<p>So this is what is happening everyone, you are being injected with spike protein building blocks, which are finding its way into the blood causing RAS system problems, which exacerbate underlying conditions.</p>
<p>By the way, the vaccine is probably not causing infertility and if it is, nothing suggests from the literature I've reviewed that it would be permanent, but it is almost certainly causing reproductive hormone imbalance (and the menstrual cycle issues) and should never be given to a pregnant woman nor someone trying to be pregnant, as there is significant chance that the hormone fluctuations could cause significant problems or even possibly miscarriage. It could also be somewhat damaging the reproductive system (like how diabetes is caused by damage to the insulin system through over exposure) but there is no studies yet to suggest this, though if you do get the vaccine, I would definitely avoid continuous boosters. </p>
<p>By the way, the ace1 receptor blocking (but specifically not the ace2) is actually associated with infertility - ace2 blocking is normally more associated with imbalanced reproductive hormones and some other similar  conditions but not infertility.  </p>
<p>Sorry but it would be quite hard to put a TL;DR.... hope this helps someone feel more confident in understanding covid --- I am not certain the mechanisms regarding loss of smell and taste, but I would imagine its related to the constriction of the capillaries in the nose (olfactory center) which is full of very tiny capillaries like the lung as well.</p></p>

        <p>Well high blood pressure can be caused by multiple reasons including cholesterol plaque buildup in the blood vessels - this being the case, the expectation would be that the symptoms ought to be worse. I would expect that someone with low blood pressure due to some other ailment might be wise to pause their medication if they were to contract covid (but that would be between their physician and them as there are many factors at play) - but - healthy lower blood pressure is associated with people who are physically fit, and so it would lead one to believe why their outcomes are normally so positive. I am not aware of (without researching) studies on this myself though - hope that helps :)</p>

<p>This is what always made the most sense to me, just based on..common sense I guess. Pretty hard to permanently alter human fertility like that over only a couple shots. Temporarily? Sure. What worries me is those of us whoa re lets say "hormone sensitive" or more prone to fertility issues. This is where I draw my line knowing my own reproductive and immune compromised history. So I choose to not get the vaccine out of an abundance of caution.</p>

        <p>Thank you :) - I think the go at your own risk is definitely related to the skill of the person giving the injection - I think most of these problems showing up (so far... I didn't want to touch vaccine enhanced disease, as there isn't enough data to come to a conclusion yet) are probably most related to human error and how much of a pathogenic effect the spike protein is actually having on the body's systems. I think theres plenty of argument as well as to why they are not necessary to most of the population but also that has been hammered a whole bunch on this sub - and just wanted to give a reasonable conclusion on the main mechanisms as to why we are seeing these side effects -- it could also be that the lymphatic system is transporting these proteins in the same way that cancer travels in that system to really wreak havoc on the body - and perhaps the blood clots are more relevant to the mRNA getting into the blood stream</p>

        <p>So from my understanding some covid vaccines do have small traces of covid in them (maybe I’m wrong and they all use a similar and synthetic spike protein different than covid. I’m not sure. Do they?) in there mRNA and mRNA inevitably still attaches to the ace2 receptor, then wouldn’t these vaccines technically be infecting or inducing the virus on someone? At least to some extent? Or is the s protein used in vaccinations not the s protein that infects? Rather just the s1 protein that helps bind to cells and if so how exactly does the s1 protein help protect and creat antibodies and such? Is it a binder to ace2 receptor that also helps propel the infectious s proteins of the virus or something. I feel like I should already know the answer here but I’d like a better explanation if you could help clear this up.
Also In reference to my question in parenthesis Is that what you meant by even without the virus it will still attach to the ace2 receptor?Meaning without covid 19 s proteins being in vaccines or did you mean as in having been infected with covid already or something?</p>
<p>Mostly curious about the top question because claims of wether or not covid vaccines can cause covid.</p>
<p>Also you have no idea how hard it was to just to type this and figure out how to ask these questions simplistically as I have lol</p>

        <p>&rt;small traces of covid in them </p>
<p>I'm not aware of this - do you have anything except a news site that has evidence of this?</p>
<p>&rt;in there mRNA and mRNA inevitably still attaches to the ace2 receptor, then wouldn’t these vaccines technically be infecting or inducing the virus on someone?</p>
<p>the symptoms of covid should show up - they ought to be less severe than the actual illness - but if someone is more sensitive to the RAS pathway interference then in both cases it could create severe outcomes I believe</p>
<p>&rt;In reference to my question in parenthesis Is that what you meant by even without the virus it will still attach to the ace2 receptor?</p>
<p>Yes im saying that the mRNA vaccine will still cause ace2 interference thus the covid symptoms - it was supposed to stay localized in the muscle tissue, but it appears that this is not the case (or is not the case for everyone)</p>
<p>&rt;Mostly curious about the top question because claims of wether or not covid vaccines can cause covid.</p>
<p>It wont <em>cause</em> covid, as the virus continues to replicate, but it will cause covid symptoms - but only if the mRNA is migrating out of the muscle tissue and into the rest of the body - this seems more likely as time has gone on - but it isn't obvious if its because of human error injecting somewhat into the bloodstream (vasculature) or if it is just migrating on its own - does that help?</p>
