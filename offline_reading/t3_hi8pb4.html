        <p>So stupid. If you canâ€™t leave your car, then ridiculous that they need to contract trace. Do people legit think you can now get the virus from being parked next to someone in a car?</p>

        <p>Notice how the new normal is absolutely in love with car culture. You might think it so off brand with some of the sjw crowd, but honestly most of them secretly love car culture</p>

        <p>Right after all the BS started, our Quaker Meeting self-inflicted a shutdown even before the regulations required it. "An abundance of caution" they said.</p>
<p>Then someone said "Hey I know, we can meet on Zoom! This'll be awesome!"  Well it wasn't for many of our tech-challenged elder folks. I'm not tech-challenged but I disliked the whole idea of mediating our spirituality through electronic devices. I tried it twice and then gave it up. </p>
<p>My wife and another Meeting member were talking one day and said "hey, how about meeting outside?"  It was suggested to the group, they deliberated, and reluctantly agreed that it might possibly be OK, with masks and separation.  Most said they'd continue on Zoom.</p>
<p>Well three weeks ago, the day of our first in-person outdoor meeting came, and the weather couldn't have been more perfect!  I figured it would just be my wife and I and a couple of others, and that was OK with me.  But instead, two-thirds of the meeting members showed up!  Most were wearing masks besides my wife and I and one other person.  But they were there. Overall it was a great session and we knew it would continue. </p>
<p>Our state went "Green" recently (which doesn't mean what I thought it would, a complete lifting of restrictions. Ha!) so the next logical thing was going back to meeting indoors.  Oh what an absurd discussion followed...  how to sanitize the wooden benches and cushions (WTF?), how to keep people well separated from each other, definitely <em>everyone</em> had to wear a mask and use hand sanitizer before entering... because, you know, the State demands it and who are we to disagree.  My heart sank.  Then someone chimed in on that same email chain, "Of course we should log the names of everyone who attends, and forward it to the township, for contact tracing."  Everyone agreed, as if it was perfectly natural to spy for the State.</p>
<p>I stood up at our most recent Meeting and said "Does anyone else find this new and extraordinary idea of reporting names to the State a very chilling proposition?"  No... just me apparently.</p>
<p>The very first sentence in the US Bill of Rights: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, <strong>or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;</strong>"  HAHAHA no longer. The state governor didn't even bother to make a law, just issued a bunch of unconstitutional diktats, and few seemed to care.</p>
<p>If you read the history of the Quakers it's shocking how they were persecuted... you would think today's Quakers would value and cherish the protection of the First Amendment.  :-(</p>
