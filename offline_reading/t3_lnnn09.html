        <p>TRILLIONS of euros were pumped out by central banks and governments in 2020 when a tiny fraction of that would have ended world hunger, lack of clean water and the lack of toilets. Obviously, ending these problems wouldn't enrich the connected oligarchs and result in ever-increasing state overreach.</p>

        <p>This whole,  "if it saves one life" is such a bullshit  reaction and emotional ploy to use on people.   Most people's first reaction to hearing it is like yeah! </p>
<p>But then you have to explain to them there would  not even be a human species if we took that approach.  Our ancestors would have never left their caves cause "it be dangerous" out there.</p>

        <p>What about 500,000?</p>
<p>I mean if you still say 500,000 lives don't matter then I guess I can't argue, but at sone point so many humans die ir are at risk that's it's understandable it would concern someone.</p>

        <p>Well first of all that 500,000 number is extremely inflated and everyone knows it.  But lets say for the sake of argument that it isn't.  Are you aware 200,000 people a year die for respiratory diseases per year on average?  Why haven't we been locked down.  I mean, 200,000 is a huge number.  And that doesn't even include respiratory infections, another 100,000 or Diarrheal diseases, 10,000.  Those are just transmittable stuff.</p>
<p>Now lets talk about auto accidents, another form of transmittable death.  You go out and get hit by a drunk driver and they kill you is worse than them giving you covid by far. 45,000.  Homicides, 20,000.  20,000! Can you believe that.  Do NOT go out of your house you could get shot.</p>
<p>Next we have the categories that covid lockdowns have probably contributed to, which are alcohol abuse, drug abuse and suicides.  Yearly average for those 3?  120,000.  These numbers are definitely going to go up in the next few years because of lockdowns. (these numbers do not include liver disease which is another 62,000)</p>
<p>Next category is preventative care, which the lockdowns have delayed greatly.  The 2 biggest killers are heart disease and cancer, 900,000 and 700,000 per YEAR.  How many people did not get their cancer screening on time and have had to wait a year?  How many people who should be out and about walking and getting exercise are going to hasten their heart conditions.</p>
<p>So that is what I have to say about that.  Life is all about risks.  And the world went upside down overnight and took the world into a depression that will last for a long long time.</p>

        <p>So you're saying all other respiratory diseases combined kill less than half the people covid has per year... think about that sentence for a moment.</p>
<p>Auto accidents where our cars and streets are covered wall to wall floor to ceiling (fucking literally) with federally mandated safety requirements? Yes i'm aware.</p>
<p>We don't know whether or to what degree they might go up, as such bringing them up means almost nothing.</p>
<p>Now we're on the same page, there's no reason anyone should have missed out on preventative care as hospitals and clinics have been running this entire time... unless they couldn't perform the preventive care because they were overstretched or something... Gee if they were overliaded we should do what we can to help them get back on track because as you said preventive care is important. Also you realize you can exercise indoors? Take some personal responsibility.</p>
<p>That's what I have to say about that.</p>

        <p>It doubt is. That is part of the plan! Of course, deaths from exposure (from being homeless), drugs, suicide, &amp; the rest can then be counted as 'Covid related' to pump up the numbers. Even homicide is up, but a wee bit harder to mis-label as 'Covid'. </p>
<p>The point was never to 'save' any lives, but to increase the profits of the mega-corporations that own the governments.</p>
