        <p>It’s my wish monsters like GuyPeakA face the music for promoting &amp; telling others to take a covid-vaccine, and then those who listen to idiots like him suffer life altering vaccine damage or die from these experimental shots. I pray for the day all of these cultists face justice.</p>

        <p>Wait are you threatening me to stop being a mod or I’ll be killed? So much for “free speech” amirite or amirite? No but seriously in case you couldn’t tell I am not taking you seriously. There are a few people on this thread who have put up genuine questions that need to be answered to help with scientific study and development. You are not being one of them. Give me a real question other than “you are a horrible person”. So what if I am a bad person, doesn’t mean I am wrong. Morality and correctness are not mutually exclusive.</p>

        <p>LOL I get messaged all the time by your type asking me why I’m brain dead or why I refuse the vaxx or why can’t I just jump off a bridge to help reduce my carbon foot print. 
My goal to msg you is to see if you’ll change your mind in a year’s time. Your sub hasn’t banned me yet, so I’ll just go search for one your posts and say “Hello, how’s life”. If I get banned from for simply saying “Hi” then that’ll be even funnier than when I got Insta-banned for simply thanking a mod from CovidVaccinated for leaving a post on. LOL JFL!</p>
<p>Edit: And yes. you are horrible for trying to get our sub banned. You’re trying to silence us.</p>

        <p>There you go again with your ever-so-virtuous vitriol &amp; smug attitude. You sociopaths get off on antagonizing those of us who wanted to be left alone, but like parasites you can’t but help yourself from trying to invade &amp; infect others with your beliefs or mindset. You (yes, you) have politicized science when there was no need for it. If there were a shred of humanity left in you then you’d stop being a mod of a group who’s goal is to see this subreddit being banned. </p>
<p>By the way, I only looked to see how old your account was, so not sure how that’s stalking, but no where did I mention I was Canadian but you must’ve done a search of my recent comments to know I mentioned I am Canadian and/or I frequent Canadian subreddits.

        <p>Canuck means Canadian dude, I didn’t need your profile for that, just your username. I am acting smug because I no longer take you seriously as a debater, you act like you know what you are talking about but instead of providing good points, you just use ad hominem over and over again pretending like it’ll work. “Oh no I am such a sociopath for proving you wrong, please forgive me!” Is that what you want me to say?

        <p>No you don’t. You’re just scared of “government takeovers” and being nano-chipped or depopulated or whatever. Aside from all that, the mask mandates are gone, you can basically go about your business whether your vaxxed or not (because “vaccine passports” never became a thing either).

        <p>I’m pretty much focused on the U.S., where I know for a fact it’s not going to happen. The Fed has flat-out stated its not feasible, and the mask mandate has been lifted everywhere in the “honor system”. </p>
<p>On the local level, there may be some people/groups saying vax passports would be a good idea epidemiologically, but there’s no will to implement it anywhere. In fact, the trend is actually opposite, and there are more “bans” on vaccine passports (ie Texas) than plans to implement them.</p>
<p>Bottom line, it’s bad-faith to argue that they’re a realistic possibility, at least in the US. They don’t really have much traction anywhere that I know of, unless you consider foreign countries requiring proof of vaccination to enter their country- which is a standard requirement and not an equivalent idea to a “vaccine passport”. </p>
<p>I just went to Walgreen’s, here in Massachusetts, a few wore masks, most didn’t, and no one asked to “see my papers”. As one of the strictest lockdown/mask states, if it’s back to normal here, the rest of the country must look a lot like its pre-covid self, in terms of freedom of movement.</p>
<p>Call me a shill all you want, I don’t really have an agenda except observing the world around me. I think you’re afraid of things that have no basis in reality- the vaccine isn’t being forced on anyone, no one’s being singled out or treated differently for not vaccinating, mask requirements didn’t lead to crazy government overreach, now that the crisis is passing the emergency measures are being lifted, and you’re free to go about your business however you see fit. </p>
<p>Nothing to really be scared of anymore, except catching covid if you’re unvaccinated!</p>

        <p>You used the same source as last time. Here is the proof you want so badly. EUA doesn’t change the authorization level, it just speeds up administrative and manufacturing processes, it doesn’t affect the research or development process at all, making them virtually the same: https://vaccine.unchealthcare.org/science/vaccine-approval/whats-the-difference-between-fda-emergency-use-authorization-and-fda-approval/</p>

<p>No, just no. You're wrong. Show me a completed clinical trial. Hell, show me a completed animal trial where the animals didn't all die.</p>
<p>You can't cause it ain't there.</p>
<p>Clinical trials aren't complete until 2023.</p>

        <p>Do you believe science is infallible? Do you believe everything has to be perfect or it isn’t true? Oh no one animal died compared to the other 20 billion guess it doesn’t work! There are no gene therapy injections too in vaccines. The vaccines affect your B memory cells, which produce antibodies to fight the virus. If the real thing shows up, your body can instantly produce those antibodies and you are golden. It doesn’t change your genes at all. You are still you after the vaccine, your body is just able to manufacture anti-COVID weapons. Updating one file on your computer doesn’t change the whole thing. It is still your computer. Stop saying false things to me and then calling me a war criminal.</p>

        <p>Long term studies don’t exist because coronavirus is new. We don’t have the time to carefully pick it apart, we have to act NOW. They don’t exist because they can’t exist. Life as we know it will not allow it to exist yet, there isn’t enough time. True science is about finding the best way possible, not the best way overall. We may have had a safer route if we went through tedious long-term studies, but then millions would die from our inaction. By acting quick, we were able to save a lot more potential victims. This IS science. Science changes as new things arise, you either change with it or get washed out. It looks like you are about to do the latter. You refuse to accept the truth, tradition will not work here, we need to be new, even if it involves changing what so many people held as fact. Sorry to say it, but life isn’t what it used to be anymore, you just have to accept that.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to do anything. You can choose to sit in your house and rot too. You are never free of the consequences of your actions, by not getting vaccinated you are putting other people at risk who cannot get vaccinated. Also I never called you “anti-science”, I just hate it when you are wrong. Then again, considering this sub is literally called nonewnormal, I doubt you all would accept the new normal that we have to deal with. What a senseless waste.</p>

        <p>If you could read, you would understand “virtually the same” means they act the same way. The only difference is EUA acts quicker and is better in times of crisis, aka a pandemic. Other than that they are identical in function.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, but the Covid vaccines don't have full approval by the CDC, only emergency use authorisation so I'm not sure why you're mentioning approval.  That's exactly one of the reasons why some people don't want to take it yet.  </p>
<p>By the way, not everyone here is antivaxx, I personally have not even been offered the vaccine, and I find the extreme views about the vaccine on both sides to be counterproductive to this whole situation.</p>

        <p>Oxycontin - last decade, shouldn't have been approved and took years for that to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>And I went to school with a kid deformed by thalidomide and that was only 25 years ago because the drug was still being used in some countries for a long time.</p>
<p>Plus recently another antidepressant where the studies were falsified and lead to issues like suicide in young teenagers and was then removed from the market.  Supposedly tested properly through lengthy FDA process and yet still was not safe.</p>
<p>Ergotamine - removed from market due to causing severe heart issues and increasing risk of heart attack.  </p>
<p>There's loads, just mentioned thalidomide because it's well known.</p>

        <p>The whole point was that freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences. If you talk shit, you will get hit. If you refuse to get the vaccine and put other people’s lives at risk with your own selfishness, you will most likely not like the blowback that comes with acting like a selfish prick. A strawman isn’t a strawman if it is true, then it becomes parallelism.</p>

        <p>Got it, I can't have an opinion so I must be canceled. If you need to silence dissent, you have no argument.  </p>
<p>As for the vaccine. How does my not getting it effect those that you it? If it's so effective,  they should have no problems with me not getting it. If they can still catch it, what's the point of the vaccine? If you say "the people who are immune compromised", then they shouldn't be around people because Wuhan isn't the only virus out there. </p>
<p>So go ahead and keep trying to silence different opinions than yours, I'm sure you'll love being silenced when you have a different opinion from the group. You see, you have one here and haven't been banned. We can see who the tolerant ones really are.</p>

        <p>You fail to realize tolerance is about being intolerant of intolerance. If you are intolerant of protecting people from a disease, I will not tolerate you in return. There is no compromise here, there is no power dynamic. It is selfishness vs sacrifice. All you are being asked to do is get a shot, your ancestors were asked to get shot.

        <p>What if you are putting my life at risk by taking the vaccine?</p>
<p>The science shows that people who take the vaccine are more likely to spread variants. [1]</p>
<p>On the other hand, people like me who had prior infection are protected from variants. [2]  Natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity[3], and is long-lasting.[4]  </p>
<p>You are being selfish by choosing inferior immunity from a vaccine, and causing the virus to mutate leading to a super-virus.   These vaccines will not eradicate the virus.  They do not stop infection or transmission, they just make it less likely you die from it.  So if variants are more likely in the vaccinated, and most of the vaccinated are getting infected anyway, guess what happens?  The virus mutates faster.</p>
<p>Instead let me suggest something that couldn't happen because it was censored from the internet.   People could treat the virus.   They could take Ivermectin, artemisinin, and steam-inhale iodine (which saved my life by getting it out of the lungs) to get over the acute phase of the virus.  Too bad any clinical studies with those treatments are scrubbed from the internet.  </p>
<p>You are advocating the opposite of what needs to be done to save lives.  You're not only wrong about the science, but you want medical fascism to force the wrong science upon me and ruin my life.  WTF is wrong with you?</p>

        <p>Damn if the username here doesn’t check out, nothing does. Other than that let me break this down for you.</p>
<p>The reason why vaccinated people are able to catch variants more is because there are less variety of variants they can get, because they are already immune to the common ones. Of course if someone is vaccinated against one strain, they are likely to get the other, because the process of elimination dictates you will get the variant more often.</p>
<p>The second source is true. If you get COVID, you are more likely to be protected from variants. The issue is vaccines basically mimic getting the virus, so you would be immune as well, without having to recover.</p>
<p>The third source is similarly wrong because we don’t have enough information on vaccine effectiveness, but we do know natural immunity can wear off fairly quickly (about 8 months). https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-long-does-immunity-last-after-covid-19-what-we-know</p>
<p>Read my previous reply on natural immunity. It is spotty at best and possibly dangerous at worst. You should not be infecting yourself with COVID, you should be getting the vaccine so you don’t have to recover after getting sick.</p>
<p>Also if those studies were “scrubbed from the internet”, then you have no proof it works, making your argument invalid.</p>
<p>Finally, ad hominem “WTF is wrong with you?” isn’t very effective on me. I already don’t care about my self-esteem much, so you trying to make me feel bad for telling people to get a vaccine just shows that you don’t have a real argument, and are just spewing nonsense big words to try to sound smart. Not a great plan.</p>

        <p>Your own source says "this shows that the body can remember SARS-CoV-2. If it encounters the virus again, the memory B cells can quickly gear up and produce antibodies to fight it."  Yet the media only go on and on about current levels of antibody titers.   Don't you think that's misleading?</p>
<p>They imply the vaccine is better than natural immunity just looking at one aspect of immunity and ignoring how fast bcells could make antibodies again if needed.  My source [4]  supports that those bcell last in your bone marrow and seem permanent.  </p>
<p>Anyway I know I'm not going to convince you. </p>
<p>The reason I said WTF is wrong with you is that you're so confident in your position, that you want take away people's freedom by creating passports and censoring any information you don't like.  That's fascism, and it should be called out.</p>

        <p>You fail to see why the bone marrow increases. It is because your blood cells are destroyed by the virus, so your body bumps up production to replace it. Other diseases like leukemia also increase blood cell development, is that a good thing? I don’t think so. The “information” we are trying to censor is misleading and very dangerous to unaware people. People read your posts and comments and they believe that vaccines are bad or masks are bad, they don’t follow the guidelines, and they get themselves or others very sick. Of course we don’t like what you are saying because it is wrong. You are actively spouting bullshit and trying to say if you don’t like it your a fascist or whatever.</p>

        <p>So, is this what you do? Just moderate on Reddit and ban people who don’t agree with you? Don’t you have anything else to do besides targeting a community?</p>
<p>Edit: I saw your crosspost from this community. Your goal is to get ban from r/NoNewNormal? What does this accomplish? Oh right, it doesn’t accomplish anything besides showing how much of an idiot you are.</p>

Your sub is a pit of fear, an echo chamber for Covid “truthers” to make up bogus claims, share misleading memes and is basically the equivalent of a boil on the ass of Reddit.

        <p>I don’t respect opinions that hurt other people. Why should I respect someone who is spreading misinformation that could potentially kill someone? It is like saying yes it’s okay to burn down my house because its your opinion it should be burned down. Not much common sense to be found.</p>

        <p>Hoo boy thanks for the homework. Let’s see here:</p>
<p>&rt;CDC, FDA, and BMJ all disagree with your opinion do you not respect them?</p>
<p>No comment.</p>
<p>&rt;YOUR opinions hurt people.</p>
<p>Similarly no comment.</p>
<p>&rt;There is no FDA-approved vaccine for COVID-19: https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download</p>
<p>The FDA has authorized emergency authorization for Covid-19 vaccines. They are authorized like it or not: https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use</p>
<p>&rt;Clinical trials don't end until 2023: https://www.fda.gov/media/144325/download</p>
<p>Yeah of course they don’t. The vaccine is an EMERGENCY. We have already done clinical trials and they pretty much all point to the vaccine being safe. https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/is-the-covid19-vaccine-safe</p>
<p>&rt;To claim otherwise, force, or coerce an experimental treatment is a violation of international law under the Nuremberg code: https://media.tghn.org/medialibrary/2011/04/BMJ_No_7070_Volume_313_The_Nuremberg_Code.pdf</p>
<p>You fail to realize that is with normal peacetime regulations. This is a health emergency, like a war. Some restrictions need to be lifted for the overall safety of a nation, such as rationing.</p>
<p>&rt;Dr. Fauci funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MndwrOzDvo https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/08/29/907237520/group-whose-nih-grant-for-virus-research-was-revoked-just-got-a-new-grant https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-intel-republicans-say-significant-circumstantial-evidence-of-covid-wuhan-lab-leak</p>
<p>Other than the <em>cough</em> unusual sources <em>cough</em> let’s see here: While gain-of-function research does seem dangerous on paper you have to realize something. They aren’t making these viruses able to infect humans more, they were designed to allow them to infect lab animals like rabbits. This is so humans won’t have to be subjected to covid in testing for stuff like vaccines. Gain-of-function research is PREVENTING us from being used as lab animals. I thought you people would like that more but oh well.</p>
<p>&rt;PCR testing is wildly inaccurate: https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4916</p>
<p>It’s really not. While false negative rates can be high when you are already infected, false positives are nearly unheard of, mostly being caused by lab contamination and other human error. We aren’t perfect people. https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-test-is-best-for-covid-19-2020081020734</p>
<p>&rt;There was huge financial incentive for hospitals to inflate case numbers: usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/</p>
<p>Most of the supposed pressure were not from physicians, but from hospital administrators. Other than that, we have no real evidence that they did do it, so benefit of the doubt says that no, doctors are probably not all in a large conspiracy designed to get you infected with covid.</p>
<p>&rt;People who died "of COVID" had on average, 4 co-morbidities: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm</p>
<p>How is this surprising? If you have co-morbidities, you will be sicker. This doesn’t prove that COVID isn’t dangerous to “normal” people, it just proves it is more dangerous to sicker people.</p>

(Continues to waste my time) When you bring up innocents while children are being put in vaccine trials for something they are at so very little risk for. You can’t be reasoned with. Please realize the companies you are shilling for have hurt so many innocents, true innocents. If you can’t acknowledge that, there is not much to say to you.</p>

        <p>&rt; SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Elicits Cell Signaling in Human Host Cells: <strong>Implications</strong> for <strong>Possible</strong> Consequences of COVID-19 Vaccines</p>
<p>These spike proteins may be completely safe for all we know. They are only implications, and they are only hypothetical. That’s right, I used the “possible” argument back at you. Irony is great sometimes.</p>
<p>&rt;Second source from Al-Jazeera</p>
<p>That is in Nigeria dude. A lot of the people there have no access to modern amenities and sanitation, so of course they will experience more ill effects. Dirty needles, expired vaccines, and other problems manifest quite a bit in more impoverished places, and trying to compare them to first-world countries seems very disingenuous.</p>

        <p>Geez I thought Canada would be more supportive of progressiveness. Oh well, let me explain. Your entire premise is flawed because it is an oxymoron. By refusing to get vaccinated (with a vaccine that will pretty much never kill you), you are potentially exposing other people to the virus by allowing yourself to become a vector for said virus. Those infected by you might die from their infection, which could’ve been prevented if you vaccinated. Your opinion itself isn’t killing anyone, but the results of said opinion are quite real, and very deadly. I recommend getting vaccinated, you are Canadian after all, so you should be able to find a vaccine center near you. I promise you won’t regret it.</p>

        <p>Ok 👌 I’ll wait for the day that the authorities drag me away &amp; execute me for murder. 🙄
Your entire premise is based on I’m possibly carrying a “deadly virus” (with a very high survival rate) &amp; supposedly passing it on to others. There’s absolutely no proof that it’s even possible for an asymptotic person (aka a healthy person) or doing such a thing, but let’s not waste each other’s time; if I present you my evidence you’ll counter with yours or simply write “No comment” (which you’ve written earlier to someone else). You can’t even acknowledge anything this community presents to you because you’re drunk on your own hubris.</p>

        <p>I put “no comment” because there is no argument against them, because their argument fails to actually follow the guidelines of an argument. Saying “the gubmint did it” isn’t an argument. It doesn’t deserve a reply because there is none. Also the “high survival rate” doesn’t mean crap when you have 7.6 billion people in the world. Exponents exist, and a tiny fraction can inflate to huge numbers when put with other big numbers. Thank you for not wasting my time.</p>

        <p>Yes, the way to fight the toxic ideology that promotes fear and conspiracies theories is to drown it out with laughter and sanity. That being said, if an argument is being made that is completely not based in reality and can not be rationally held, it clearly is not a valid argument or opinion to hold, counter to an opinion or argument based on empirical reality. So maybe it shouldn't be silenced, but it should be given no credibility and there is nothing wrong with making a mockery out of it.</p>
<p>So, yes I agree with you. By outright banning something like this sub, it might become more attractive to those who just want to be edgy or contrarian without the critical thinking skills necessary to see how harmful the ideology behind this sub is. On the other hand, so many individuals already lack the brain development, critical thinking skills, or tools to understand and see the difference between a rational and reasoned thought and an irrational thought.</p>
<p>It's hard to know the best approach with cutting back against harmful misinformation. Will <em>x</em> approach work towards combating the spread of bad faith propaganda or will it just embolden those dedicated to spreading even further? Hopefully there is a shift and reality, critical thinking, and empathy will no longer be seen as political touchstones to be either for or against.</p>

        <p>I appreciate that, unfortunately this virus isn’t a pick or choose situation. This is humans vs virus here. We need to band together and stop this thing before it is too late. Sorry if you dislike it, but now is not the time for “reasoned arguments” about it, we need action. There are people’s lives on the line, and it may seem far away from you, but the virus doesn’t care, it will take away lives all the same. I know we are irreconcilable, I know we will never truly get along, but I love humanity too much to let it kill itself with its own inaction and self-doubt. We need to stop this together, and the first step is getting vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I started the pandemic being quite scared of the virus but very confused because it seemed that every snippet of information had a conflicting snippet. I didn’t wear a mask for the first month of panic and I had so many interactions with people being truly hateful and disgusting towards me that I began to move towards the side that I felt harbored the least hate and most unconditional love for others. I still wear a mask when required but I remember all the people who went out of their way to show their hatred for me simply because I was confused by conflicting information and politicized agendas and so chose to continue on as if all was normal. I will never forget the hatred directed at me in the moments that I most needed love, understanding, and compassion, and I will always remember the people who showed me that love and compassion which I so deeply needed were always those people who did not mask, who refused the vaccine, and who were not fearful of something they couldn’t see, smell, touch or observe for themselves. If people are nice to me, I like them. It’s simple. You seem like a reasonable person who can understand that concept, and when I overwhelmingly receive abuse and hate from people divided from me by my choice to question orders from above, it’s quite clear which side is right for me. I choose the people who I see as genuine. I choose the people who I can trust to always have my back and who don’t deride me simply for thinking differently. If it was just about the virus, we the people would not be as divided as we are now, but I believe that is by design. 
I hope you are well and I wish you fair winds in this life and all that follow.</p>

        <p>That’s awful to hear. I received quit a bit of blowback from both sides to be honest, I just wanted to pick whichever option would help the most people. I hope that you can eventually come to terms with what those awful people did to you, and maybe even get vaccinated despite their abuse. This pandemic has brought out the worst in people, so I hope you show your best. Take care.</p>

        <p>That is awful that you received that treatment. I hope that you can understand the position those who did so found themselves in as well. A lot of us have lost loved ones to this, or have ourselves been affected and permanently harmed by this horrendous virus.</p>
<p>Most people wanted this to be over with and didn't want to see anyone else lose their life or loved ones. I had a few coworkers who didn't give a shit about anyone else, but still wore a mask, and socially distanced for their own selfish reasons of wanting to slow/stop the spread so they could go back to their previous routines.</p>
<p>I think I shouldn't have to point out, that the side that harboured the most unconditional love for others was not the side directly and indirectly promoting the deaths of millions of people. I'm sure they made you feel more comfortable about your actions, but the value of the comfort of some does not outweigh the value of the lives of all.</p>
<p>I see it like drunk driving. Everyone knows that driving drunk is an ill-informed decision, or at least not the "right" thing to do. If you choose to drive drunk and end up hurting only yourself, then that was you just making a choice and you haven't directly harmed anyone else in your choice and it isn't a wider issue. It still is obviously not a smart choice to make, but as long as you're not harming anyone but yourself, most people won't show vitriol to you. If you choose to drive drunk and end up killing others as a direct result, now others will likely not be as okay with your choices.</p>
<p>Same goes for suicide and murder/suicide. If you take your own life, others may see the loss of your life as tragic and be sorrowful. If you choose to kill 10 people before killing yourself, those same people will likely not direct as much sorrow and sympathy towards you, but rather the people you killed.</p>
<p>It's the same willful disregard of others in the pandemic. If you aren't concerned with contracting it and don't want to change your behaviour, that's fine as long as you're not putting others at risk or harming others. If your choices and actions are directly harming others and you're willfully promoting the spread of a deadly disease, then you are not really the victim in that situation if others call you out for it.</p>
<p>Again, I am sorry you went through that and received hate for your choices. That is not right and should not have happened. But I hope you can understand that placing all human lives above the comfort of some people is an okay position to take. Someone whose loss is getting yelled at is not equal to some whose loss is their life.</p>

There are no words that strangers on the internet are capable of typing that would make me trust the corporations involved in this given what I have read and learned about their track records long before this: FDA, CDC, Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson...</p>

        <p>&rt;I mean yeah. That is the reasoning. You never proved any of our claims as wrong</p>
<p>I made no effort or promise to, and I’d expect no ‘less’ from your ‘scientific method’ than to conclude that anything that no one disproved must be 100% reliable</p>
<p>&rt;just insulting us over and over again</p>
<p>Get real, hypocrite, are you really going to make me go to the trouble of quoting you? </p>
<p>&rt;Basically the equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears and going neener neener.</p>
<p>...Because I won’t be convinced to trust corrupt people with my health based on nothing, so the trend of you and these really poor analogies continues </p>
<p>&rt;And you are correct about that last statement, my arguments are out of this sub’s league, but not in the way you think.</p>
<p>This is you in a nutshell. ‘I feel relevant, AMA!’ Then offer nothing new, and declare yourself victorious and superior. Yawn.</p>

        <p>You fail to understand the burden of proof doesn’t fall on me to prove the vaccine is dangerous, it falls on you. We have already proven the vaccines are safe through the millions who are already vaccinated and didn’t die. What’s your rebuttal?</p>
<p>I never insulted you specifically. I said your argument is wrong. You all have called me a shill, a liar, a fascist, a marxist, etc. Go ahead and quote me, I don’t really care.</p>
<p>Based on nothing? Have you even read my sources? Honestly you are just being intentionally obtuse at this point. My analogy was a bit more spot on than you think.</p>
<p>And you provide no valid arguments that actually disprove mine and claim yourself as the victor. What’s your point?</p>

        <p>Man, you should read something before coming here. Onus probandi under any law in any court places the burden on the claimant to establish their claim. In this example, the public has been presented with an inoculation and the manufacturers have disseminated information claiming it to be safe. I don’t have to prove <em>or disprove</em> anything; I’m under no burden. You’re the one on the internet trying to convince strangers to do something you clearly cannot personally vouch for as much as you seem to think, as though you see yourself as some spokesperson and shouting ‘if you can’t disprove me I win’.</p>
<p>You can’t find one time I claimed victory, since there is no victory to claim; while <strong>you</strong> actually did try to make yourself out, in other subs even, to be some kind of winner because you got banned from here, but yet, here you’ve accused <em>me</em> of it. I personally haven’t called you a liar, shill, etc, but when you were full of shit I said so, because that’s what it was; using disingenuous approaches to denigrate and demean posters and their statements, and when I pointed these out, you said that “targeted harassment“ was not ‘wrong if you’re harassing thieves‘; a further admission. So, remember someone who by your extensive powers of estimation is ‘obtuse’ sees completely through your shit, so that’s about how complex the mind that conceived it is.</p>

        <p>I don’t think you have noticed how I have, multiple times, provided genuine proof of my claims. We have seen how safe the vaccine is, and how practically no one has died, despite millions receiving it. We have seen millions of people die from COVID though, so what’s your point? The burden of proof relies on you to prove that the vaccines are bad now, because all the current proof says they are good, including those “common sense” observations you guys like so much. You are wrong, you have to prove it is bad. You have to prove they are disseminating “bad information”, otherwise you are wrong. You use these big words to try to scare me, when in reality you are hurting your case more, because you don’t realize “innocent until proven guilty” exists. You prove us guilty, we have already provided our arguments. What’s yours?</p>
<p>P.S. Obtuse just means you are intentionally avoiding the argument with irrelevant information, it says nothing on your character. I called you thieves because you are stealing the chance of life and happiness from people by spreading a very preventable disease. Would murderer be more appropriate here? Let me know.</p>

        <p>The discrepancy lies in what satisfies you as ‘proof’. To wit:</p>
<p>&rt;We have seen how safe the vaccine is, and how practically no one has died</p>
<p>&rt;the burden of proof relies (sic) on you to prove that the vaccines are bad now </p>
<p>&rt;all the current proof says they are good</p>
<p>&rt;you are wrong (about...? I haven’t made any claims)</p>
<p>&rt;You have to prove they are disseminating bad information (I do?) otherwise you are wrong (...about what?)</p>
<p>&rt;innocent until proven guilty exists </p>
<p>Lol yeah? Wow, thanks for the update. That’s because the onus rests on the claimant so... ‘He who alleges must prove’.</p>
<p>I allege nothing. I don’t trust these entities. I gave you your chance.</p>
<p>All you have is strong beliefs; religious even. And yeah, ‘murderer’ sounds much cooler than ‘thieves’ but far be it from me to choose your false accusations for you; inexperience, you see.</p>

        <p>I never said the government could be trusted all the time, we HAVE to trust them on a base level. Trust and accountability are very different things. The US has pulled bad shit, I remember the BS they pulled during the Patriot Act, but also remember that they need us as well. Without us, the government falls, and they know that. They aren’t going to let us die that easily, we have too much tax money at stake.</p>

        <p>We don’t know actually. As far as I can tell, there are no conducive answers to that question. We do know 3.5 million people died from COVID, so I think your claim of “mostly non-lethal” is a bit off.</p>

        <p>I think the concerns of doctors faking covid diagnoses might hold some concern. Although it seems highly unlikely, I can see a few unsavory people faking diagnoses to potentially get extra funds. But even so, those extra diagnoses are just more burdensome to the hospitals, who are already full on patients (who are very expensive and hard to maintain), so I see little reason why they would intentionally inflict more work on themselves.</p>

        <p>I doubt it honestly. The money being put into Pfizer is from the federal government, and you know they are gonna keep a close eye on any potential purloiners. I doubt any scientist is gonna want to tangle with the feds, especially with 15 billion on the line. There is just too much room for error here, and I don’t think the government is willing to give away such a large sum of money without them receiving their fair trade.</p>

        <p>Freedom of choice doesn’t matter when the choice kills people. You are not free to murder because “muh freedumb”, because society has dictated that murder is wrong, just like exposing people to a deadly disease. This isn’t about privilege either, everyone can get the vaccine regardless of race or gender, so that’s horseshit.</p>

        <p>Damn you guys are just pulling numbers out of your ass. The total number of COVID cases is 171 million, the number of COVID deaths is 3.5 million. If we assume every single person other than the 3.5 million survive, that leaves a whopping death rate of 2.09%. That may seem small but realize this: The flu (often heralded as one of the most deadliest preventable diseases) has a death rate of 0.017%. They both have vaccines, and yet COVID remains significantly more dangerous.</p>
<p>P.S. Your survival rate is wrong too. The actual survival rate (according to my very generous statistics) is 97.1%, and that is with vaccines taken into account.</p>

<p>Maybe you can look at nnn as a kind of food bank for people's emotional and intellectual needs. Don't try to ban us, add something that might help. If you know some exculpatory facts about Peter Thiel or Albert Bourlas, throw them out there, maybe we're wrong.</p>

        <p>Hell no, I really couldn’t hurt a fly, I just hate seeing people not get vaccinated, and I already said no, I don’t simp for the police. I don’t really care for them very much, and honestly the whole system could use a good rework to increase accountability.</p>

        <p>I have a question for you. How committed are you to the vaccination game? Let's say that 5 booster shots come out next year to "combat the variants". Are you on board with all those shots too? Or will you decide on a case by case basis, fully investigating the efficacy and safety of each and every booster? And what if 1 of those 5 shots look a little suspect to you? Would you take the other 4 but not the 5th? But that will then leave you "not fully vaccinated" which may be problematic for the maintenance of your soon-to-be "vaccine passport". Not to mention the social kickback when you tell your friends and family that you might be a little "vaccine hesitant" for an upcoming booster. Oh, the horror of being "hesitant".</p>
<p>Yes, the contortions of compliance will become increasingly complex and unmanageable. There will be many hand wringing moments for those of you committed to their regime of Frankenshots they currently have in the development pipeline. And they have dozens by their own admission. </p>
<p>I just hope you can see this all the way through because you sure as hell don't want to ever be labeled "anti-vaxxer". There is no worse fear on the planet for you, I imagine.</p>

        <p>If the vaccine boosters are proven to be safe (which they probably are because they are boosters, not brand new vaccines), then yes I will take them happily. I see no issue as long as they are safe and protect those I care about from COVID/whatever disease gets pulled out of thin air.</p>

        <p>Because the new normal is what is protecting us from a deadly disease. By removing that, you are putting people’s lives at risk. Freedom ends at the end of your noose.</p>

        <p>Thank you for answering my question, I appreciate it. I am bit confused here, according to the CDC, the deadly disease has a 99.9% survival rate, how can it be considered "protecting us" to not discuss this fact (from the CDC) when you have such a low mortality rate especially when the CDC revised their numbers that only 5% of people died from the virus?</p>
<p>Second question, you mentioned that the new normal is what is protecting us from a deadly disease, how is questioning the shutting down of businesses, telling people to stay in their homes, and not be physically active in a sub-reddit harmful? If we look at the data, the "new normal" has caused more harm then good, is that worth discussing, especially if you were directly affected by the new normal?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance and you time!</p>
<p>PS: If you have time, could you explain what you meant by, "freedom ends at the end of your noose?</p>

        <p>Hey I saw your question but I got banned. Let me reply to your questions real quick.</p>
<p>&rt;Thank you for answering my question, I appreciate it. I am bit confused here, according to the CDC, the deadly disease has a 99.9% survival rate, how can it be considered "protecting us" to not discuss this fact (from the CDC) when you have such a low mortality rate especially when the CDC revised their numbers that only 5% of people died from the virus?</p>
<p>The issue with that is that there are a lot of people in the world. If you consider 7.6 billion people on Earth, and a 99.9% survival rate, that still leaves a death count of 7.6 million people. That is insanely high, and a number of that size could cause considerable damage to the world’s integrity. Who gets to choose who those unlucky people are? It just isn’t right. Furthermore remember these numbers came after the masks, social distancing, and vaccines, so the death rate would actually be much higher, closer to the 5% figure you talked about earlier. All of this is without even mentioning that COVID could possibly cause crippling long-term effects on the body like impotence and emphysema, so a lot of “survivors” could end up in an early grave.</p>
<p>&rt;Second question, you mentioned that the new normal is what is protecting us from a deadly disease, how is questioning the shutting down of businesses, telling people to stay in their homes, and not be physically active in a sub-reddit harmful? If we look at the data, the "new normal" has caused more harm then good, is that worth discussing, especially if you were directly affected by the new normal?</p>
<p>The issue isn’t the discussion, it’s the material. The new normal placed on us is what has prevented the virus from rapidly spreading and infecting people. The vaccines are now basically immunizing everyone against it, so without these precautions, COVID could’ve spread much faster, infected more people, and overflowed hospitals, preventing people from receiving life-saving treatment and ventilators. This is obviously bad, so arguing against this is bad for our society as a whole, we need this stuff to survive, why would we shoot ourselves in the foot by arguing against effective treatment?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance and you time!</p>
<p>&rt;PS: If you have time, could you explain what you meant by, "freedom ends at the end of your noose?</p>
<p>The saying means that your freedoms like speech and press are useless without protection from other people. If you argue against things that are beneficial for the continuation of society like pandemic protocol, then you will not be free of your consequences. If you send a letter to the White House saying you are going to bomb them because you dislike their policies, they will arrest you. You need power to protect, and society will not give you power if you are being antithetical to its continued existence.</p>
