<title>I personally think people should stop going to get tested if they don’t have a legitimate reason. That means if you haven’t come in close contact with a positive person and have ZERO symptoms you need to chill out. Go ahead wear your mask and social distance.</title>

        <p>A negative test doesn't mean you can't give it to your parents, though. You could be in the incubation period, it's not 100% clear whether long-lasting immunity is conferred by getting the virus, the tests are not terribly accurate, and hell, you just may not have gotten it yet.</p>
<p>Did you quarantine before the test to ensure you were outside of the incubation period?</p>

        <p>We definitely got it. We both lost our smell and taste.  </p>
<p>We got symptoms the day after we returned. We did not go anywhere or meet with anyone before the test.  </p>
<p>Trust me, the positive test definitely prevented us from meeting our parents, and I am very glad for it on that basis alone.  </p>
<p>Edit: Explaining a little more clearly: our first symptoms were a super mild runny nose, indistinguishable from allergies. My wife insisted on getting tested although I discouraged her on the basis it wasn’t a covid symptom. She got a positive 24 hours later. I got tested and got positive too. Then about 4 days later we lost smell and taste. We were scheduled to meet with our parents during the “slightly runny nose” period and I’m just grateful the positive dissuaded us.</p>

        <p>I would like to get tested to see if I have hád the virus. I strongly suspect I have actually. I was in Egypt in early to mid-march and felt awful, just awful, like i had the worst cold ever, headaches and a light fever. But within the week I was better. Just in time to be yanked home by the authorities and our travel agency cause the virus was going crazy and Egypt was closing its borders that night. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I would like to know if that was it. If I had it already. But as you say i dont know what use it would be other than to satisfy my personal curiosity. They still claim that you can have covid, then recover, then get it again. And apparently the tests to see if you have had it int he past suck and arent reliable.</p>
<p>I'm just so curious if that was it. Cause if it was... yeah it sucked. But it mostly sucked cause I was supposed to be enjoying my holiday in a great country, and I couldn't cause i felt icky. It didn't feel too bad at all. Just a regular flu basically.</p>

        <p>This^^ </p>
<p>Here’s   a story about a Florida couple who actually got arrested because they violated their house arrest order. Their neighbors were literally snitching on them to the cops for walking their dog. </p>
<p>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.local10.com/news/local/2020/07/31/key-west-couple-arrested-for-breaking-covid-19-quarantine-order/%3foutputType=amp</p>
<p>Why the hell would you get tested if you feel fine (obviously this couple didn’t feel that bad) and you aren’t going to follow the governments orders if the test turns out positive? </p>
<p>The best case scenario is that you get to keep your freedom and the worst case scenario is you are placed under house arrest for two weeks or arrested for not following said house arrest. </p>
<p>People I work with were literally (although not anymore) getting tested just because they “were curious” if they had COVID. Why?!?</p>

        <p>College students can be required to take a test for going back. Some jobs require them regularly now. As more people go back to work and college, there will be a lot of new cases. The surge will coincide with schools reopening so of course it’ll be a shitshow. The media will put this in context thankfully.</p>

<p>Twice a fucking week.</p>
<p>And, they are requiring all students and faculty (not staff afaik) to download an app called Safer in Illinois that tracks your test results and will be your key to access campus buildings. They're hiring hundreds of people to enforce this as well. They're called "Wellness Associates."</p>

        <p>This is something I'm worried about. My husband hasn't been out to the warehouse in a few months, so I have no clue what their testing policy is. Can't find the info online either. I know his cousin's roommate tested positive, so now the whole dorm is in quarantine. Glad it seems to be just a school policy that didn't trickle down to us.</p>

        <p>Nah.  I'm totally down with socially distancing with strangers- I don't like strangers being near me anyway.  But I'd like to still hang out with friends and not wear a stupid mask.  </p>
<p>Masks are a joke.  I mean... people feel safe enough to eat out in a restaurant without a mask, but they're not comfortable walking past someone in a store without a mask?  Oh, and let's not forget the stupid ritual of wearing a mask into a restaurant just to walk 11 steps to a table where you then remove your mask and speak to the waitress who comes along every few minutes... but if someone walks by you at the store without a mask, it's grounds to attack them?  </p>

        <p>Masks are a scapegoat.  Cases going up?  It's because there's not a mask mandate.  Cases still going up?  It's because people aren't wearing masks despite the mandate.  Cases going down due to herd immunity?  False it was actually masks.  </p>

        <p>I had a dentist appointment about a month ago and I had to call from my car to let them know I was there instead of using the waiting room. </p>
<p>Once they were ready for me I had to have a mask on inside, where they took my temperature. It’s hot asf where I’m at, so of course it was reading that I had a 104 fever. So then I had to sit in the waiting room (wait I thought it was off limits?) to cool off a bit and then get a good reading. </p>
<p>Of course once I was in the chair the mask wasn’t needed since they needed access to the inside of my mouth. Like is this really not some insane prank everyone’s in on that I’m not aware of yet??</p>

        <p>On the other hand, almost every other country has beaten back the virus using the only tools available - masks, social distancing and hand washing.  The US has failed to get it under control.  </p>

        <p>Then if you test positive, you can be forced to self-isolate (and maybe lose pay? I don’t know what’s up with that situation), many of the people you know may be traced and told to do the same, and all the businesses you frequent will be shut down, damaging them.</p>

        <p>This is what happened to my dad. His state isn't mandating testing or quarantines, and he's retiring, so no workplace to worry about. But his parents kicked him out on his birthday because he had a cough and a sore throat, won't let him come home until he tests positive and quarantines for 2 weeks. I guess they just won't believe him if he tests negative.</p>

        <p>They’re begging people to get tested here in NYC. Commercials airing every few minutes about it. One says “stay home, unless it’s to get tested for covid” and then it reminds you to wear your mask and blah blah blah and finishes up by saying testing is how we beat this and to come get tested. Not even “if you’re symptomatic”, nope, they want everyone in. Solves nothing and statistically will of course jack the numbers up if everyone does this</p>

        <p>in regards to wearing a mask and social distancing:</p>
<p>it is important to remember, that  self isolation when being sick makes sense, but there is no science behind the made up insanity of 1.5 and 2 meter or whatever else distance, that people should keep between each other, that is just all made up bullshit.</p>
<p>and for masks, the evidence shows 0 effect at all:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a></p>
<p>&rt;In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks</p>
<p>and masks do cause harm, so if u want to be healthy and well have oxygen...  then u don't want to wear one:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technocracy.news/blaylock-face-masks-pose-serious-risks-to-the-healthy/">https://www.technocracy.news/blaylock-face-masks-pose-serious-risks-to-the-healthy/</a></p>
<p>it is important to understand, that  masks are not something neutral, that at worst doesn't harm your health and might do a tiny bit (which is how a lot of criminals on tv will try to sell it)</p>
<p>face- /surgical masks can and do cause harm.</p>
<p>now with that out of the way, it is important to remember, that the PCR tests, that they are doing are utter worthless garbage, that should NEVER have been used period.</p>
<p>test isn't verified, no known false negative and false positive rates and well on top of that the supposed virus never fulfilled the koch's postulates, but let's leave that  aside.</p>
<p>example for how worthless they are, pawpaw (a fruit), goats and sheep tested positive with this test, they took samples and gave them a human name and stuff and the tests came back positive. fruits!</p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/">https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/</a></p>
<p>just focus on: <strong>test is worthless garbage.</strong></p>
<p>so what do u achieve by changing the number of tests u do per day? u change the number of tests, that will come back positive, because as mentioned there is a false positive rate even at the best of tests and this one is worthless, so again who knows what the rate is.</p>
<p>to give a very practical example, so that it is easier to understand:</p>
<p>week 1: u test 100000 people get 10000 positive; garbage news: "oh no covid-19 bad tons of sick people"</p>
<p>week 2: u test 50000 people (half) and get 5000 positive (half); garbage news: "we are doing it, the measures while hard on your economy are working we can get through this"</p>
<p>week 3: u test 200000 people and get 20000 positive results (4x than week 2 and 2x of week 1) garbage news: "oh no, it seems, that the measures are not enough, we need to lockdown harder and make fines for people  leaving their house, and masks and gloves and forced vaccines, etc... it seems, that it might takes years!"</p>
<p>now in the case of a real epidemic, what what u actually do?</p>
<p>u would start by properly isolating the pathogen, this means fulfilling koch's postulates.</p>
<p>then  u start working on tests and the tests will be validated and  known false positive and false negative  levels will  be known.</p>
<p>then what u do, to know how "bad" the situation might be, u make a population slice study.</p>
<p>this means, that u find a place, where things seem bad and voluntarily ask the public to do the tests. let's say 80% agree to do the NON INVASIVE! tests (the insane pcr tests rightnow are literally  drilling down far down your nose as far as it goes, fuck knows what harm they might be doing or what they are for)</p>
<p>and then after having  gotten the data  of a city, where u asume things are quite bad, u properly analyze the test data, this includes  adjusting for false positive rates for example.</p>
<p>and only then! can u see what's going on  in a place.</p>
<p>in germany   such a study was done for covid-19, BUT keep in mind, that tests are garbage and the virus wasn't isolated, BUT still let's look at the early data from it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/german-study-shows-coronavirus-mortality-rate-five-times-lower-than-widely-reported-numbers">https://www.theblaze.com/news/german-study-shows-coronavirus-mortality-rate-five-times-lower-than-widely-reported-numbers</a></p>
<p>it shows a 12% infection rate in a bad place and only a 0.37% mortality rate for infected.</p>
<p>so this puts us at a 0.06% mortality rate for the general public in the worst case.</p>
<p>HOWEVER this data got mostly ignored, because it didn't fit the agenda and instead false death rates were used, where even motorcycle accidents are counted as "covid-19 deaths":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/florida-man-20s-who-died-motorcycle-wreck-labeled-covid-19-death-state">https://www.zerohedge.com/political/florida-man-20s-who-died-motorcycle-wreck-labeled-covid-19-death-state</a></p>
<p>and  random testing as already mentioned, meaning that u can go up and down the "new infections per day" rate as u please by controlling the number of tests done.</p>
<p>double points, if u only test sick people in hospitals, because they of course have a VASTLY higher chance of dying soon than the general public.</p>
<p>lately the mainstream media is even trying to play the public to the extreme, thinking, that the public is actually that dumb, to not understand, that higher infection rates with no new deaths doesn't mean, that things get worse, but that the actual death/positive case rate would be shrinking, meaning, that the supposed virus is a lot more harmless, than told by them. just trying whatever to control the idiots i guess.</p>
<p>so what i would say in regards to tests:</p>
<p><strong>STOP ALL PCR TESTS!</strong> about covid-19</p>
<p>and throw the people, who are trying to mandate medical procedures onto the public (which those tests are) in prison, where they belong.</p>

<p>I have a lot more, but people usually reply "Hours of learning?! Not gonna do it..." Some people told me that over 4 months ago and they still haven't even done an hour or two of learning.</p>
<p>edit: They are all over the "fact-checking" on this. They don't even use sources in fact-checking lol. I'm a "fact-checker" too, only difference is that I don't have anything to gain from lying to people. Seriously follow the money on some of these "fact-checking" agencies, lol what a farce. $$$$$$$$$$</p>

        <p>ha yeah, those "fact checkers" are most all full of sh1t.</p>
<p>corbett did a nice report on them and usually u find connections to stuff like the gates foundation really quickly.</p>

<p>they really only exist for those, who don't think, but want to strongly hold onto a believe.</p>
<p>u know what i would love to see,  not that people research an hour at least about something, but that people would NOT have extremely strong believes about topics, that they didn't research at all.</p>
<p>instead of: "THOSE TESTS ARE GREAT, WHAT ARE U SAYING!" someone, who doesn't want to do the bare minimum research could say: "i didn't look into it, so i don't know. sounds interesting though"</p>
<p>of course the indoctrination system called public school system is a big reason for the fear of being wrong and the fear of not knowing and the acceptance of blind believe in authority.</p>
<p>i wish people would at least admit, that they don't know and that is fine.</p>
<p>damn  i didn't remember his name, but i remember him from the great house of numbers documentary. hm, that documentary is already 11 years old.</p>
<p>liam scheff is also already dead :/ and from the originally german documentary "i won't go quietly":  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2T0Z-FOmf0&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2T0Z-FOmf0&amp;</a>  (it released in cinemas and dvds, but  creators later decided to also ad it for free  on youtube)</p>
<p>about the aids/hiv hoax several died/have been pushed to death.</p>
<p>damn, thinking about this lie  makes me wanna cry again, how they are stealing children from loving parents and poisoning and killing them with AZT :/ based on the also 100% worthless hiv test :/</p>
<p>well here is to hoping, that humanity wakes up and once the covid-19 PCR tests are burned  and laughed at and the criminals who wanted to mandate them are in prison, we hopefully also finally end the hiv test slavery and end this madness.</p>
<p>in memory of liam scheff and highly relevant these days:</p>

<p>Yes 100% this. Been dealing with this my whole damn life.</p>
<p>I'm happy to admit I don't know, or I'm not sure. It encourages me to sit down and learn!</p>

<p>Yes! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP98ZKt709A ""The Six Purposes of Schooling" - John Taylor Gatto" </p>
<p>I'm glad I tossed them in the garbage and took charge of my own education. I think a teacher lied to me at a young age and I proved them wrong with one of my books. They got angry and sent me to detention instead of just admitting they were wrong. Jaded me on public indoctrination for the rest of my life. I did have some good teachers though, they taught me how to be a "lifelong learner"!</p>

        <p>yes, when i see prison, then i mean, that we the people throw them in there, i am very aware, the "justice" system is full of criminals and pedophiles, that don't care one bit about justice or rights.<br>
WE need to awake and throw those criminals into some cells. historically  it often resulted into more extreme measures than just prison, BUT staying as peaceful as possible  strategically can be a very good move.<br>
the absolutely peaceful demonstration of 100000s in berlin germany for example was a good peaceful strategic move.<br>
video of it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhG03vbc8BY&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhG03vbc8BY&amp;</a>  (time frame from  12:40 to  14:10)</p>
<p>the next demonstration in berlin on the 29.august 2020 might already result in the police jumping over to the public, which would be great. now of course i am not delusional and am very aware, that a tons of police or criminals, that enjoy harming others and that depending on country things might be a lot different, but already setting the sign of  for example a few police people publicly at a demonstration saying "no we wan't try to stop the speakers, we are standing with the public" would be massive.</p>
<p>so throwing the criminals in prison  would the final result of a quite peaceful strategy in countries, where that is even possible and that is the case for germany for example.</p>
<p>finding justice in the legal system of course is not gonna happen and wasn't what i meant by throwing them all in prisons.</p>
<p>i hope this clarified things a bit.</p>

I'm wearing a mask anyway, so it shouldn't matter right?? Besides, asymptomatic spread is so statistically insignificant that this is all ridiculous.

        <p>That, and false positives. False positives mean that no matter who you test, new cases will continue to be generated. Since the media are ignoring other statistics and mostly reporting new cases, by getting tested you may be generating the numbers they need for their narrative. One of my close family members likely had a false positive.</p>

        <p>I'd go even further. With all the information we have now, why are we not treating this like other viruses? Testing should happen at hospitals and doctors' offices to confirm diagnosis. No testing of people who don't need treatment, no testing to make people feel safe. What will make people feel safe is to stop the barrage of meaningless data that our overlords are using to justify their fear mongering and power tripping.</p>

        <p>Exactly. If this situation were being navigated with absolutely no fearmongering or political opportunism at play, we would already be about 90% over it. The good news should’ve been broken that it wasn’t nearly as bad as it was expected to be, and that should have marked the end of the bulk of the response. If politicians and news stations would start treating it in a way that is on par with the actual level of threat, most people would get over their fears very quickly.</p>

        <p>I've commented about this elsewhere in the thread, so forgive me, but not having a smart phone won't help in all situations. My alma mater is requiring all faculty, students, and staff to download a tracking app that holds info about test results. It will be used as a key to access campus buildings. </p>
<p>If you don't have a smartphone, you can't access any buildings. It's as simple as that. If you cannot afford to buy smartphone, the university has a program to give them out for free to those in need. </p>

        <p>I got tested today. Gfs daughter got it last week, just came back positive the other night. I wouldn’t have gotten it except I’m symptomatic. I also wouldn’t have gotten it if my work wasn’t paying me to quarantine. But I worked through the whole shutdown while some coworkers got to get those sweet sweet unemployment bucks. It’s time to get mine. It’s also so when I do go back to work I can walk right in with no mask. Cause if I have the antibodies I can’t spread it, right?</p>

        <p>I'd go ahead and add that if you've never come into contact with a <em>symptomatic</em> person, and don't have any symptoms yourself, you should not get tested.</p>
<p>One of my family members tested positive (though he was completely asymptomatic) and so the rest of us got tested and all of us came back negative. A month later, that family member was tested again with the antibody test, and <em>he</em> tested negative, which may have meant his initial test was a false positive.</p>

        <p>It's only anecdotal data, but here is a small data point for asymptomatic spread.</p>
<p>Our surgical service was consulted on a patient in the hospital for probable osteomyelitis (bone infection) that required an amputatation. Throughout the next couple of days, myself, two of my colleagues, the nurse attending to the patient, the patient's roomate and her mother were all in close proximity to the patient in an enclosed room with repeated exposures. Patient was not wearing a mask at all and all we had on were surgical masks.</p>
<p>COVID test for her comes back positive. She was totally, 100% asymptomatic and had no idea she had it. To this date, not one of us has developed any symptoms of any kind. This was almost 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Small data point? Sure. But surely at least one of us would have contracted it if it were that transmissible among asymptomatic carriers.</p>

        <p>I have mixed feelings on this. If I hadn't gotten tested 3 weeks ago I wouldn't have known I was positive and I wouldve possibly spread it to my partner's elderly relatives I was going to see on Saturday. Asymptomatic cases or barely symptomatic cases are SO COMMON.</p>

        <p>Considering how many false positives are generated by the tests, this is excellent advice.  (UNLESS YOU ARE IN A HIGH RISK GROUP) Taking a test means you risk being quarantined for 2 weeks.  2 weeks of your life than you can't get back for a virus with a 99. 7 cure rate and most people who "have" it are asymptomatic.</p>
<p>You don't get a test when you aren't sick for the flu. (UNLESS YOU ARE IN A HIGH RISK GROUP) This bug is in the same family.</p>

        <p>It’s SOP for virus control.   Bring the virus down to the lowest practicable number of cases.  Then regularly and randomly test the population.  When someone gets a positive result, track down people they were in close contact with.   Have them quarantine until they can be tested.  If someone in that group is positive, do the same thing.  A number of people are inconvenienced, but the virus is stopped before it gets out of control again.  It’s out of control when there are so many people.  Infected that it’s impossible to know who gave it to who.</p>

        <p>I will take the test soon. That's mandatory for certain people now.</p>
<p>Here's hoping it comes up positive so I can go out and breathe on some boomers to "spite" them =)</p>
