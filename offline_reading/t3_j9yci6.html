    <strong>My COVID/New Normal speech</strong>
    <p><p>This is from a tradbrit, i take my country very seriously, it comes second from my religion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And i must say that over the last 7 months i have seen a brutal attack on our country from the one group of people we once trusted, and we have violated ourselfs, our own rules, with the lockdowns and restrictions, for we are meant to have a stiff upper lip under any circumstances, but our PM panicked at the first sight of the virus, at fear of his oh so precious NHS he locked us down, shut shops, pubs, forced us apart, only to give some back, and take some away.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We have lost countless pubs, resturants and shops, we have lost things that we will never get back.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The latest restrictions show that of pure unbritishness, to target our universities, our pubs, our resturants and traditions that been around for countless years, we're still at risk of losing it all, but they never care.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The lockdowns are making people rude, fogging brains and trapping people into a perpetual fear, no longer are we britain, but an orwellian superstate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>No longer is ettiquette and respect seen as a good deed, but rather a rude thing that puts you at risk of a mysterious, apparently deadly virus.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Our traditions were always at risk before, but this has given fuel to those who do not respect it, no longer we are allowed to do what defines our country, absolutely none of it, we are all just mere puppets, and there is no discipline for what our country really is, our country is driving headlong into this without any goal, it's a stampedge of unlawful destruction of what we knew and loved for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I still have faith for brittania, but not for the people in it, not even those who control it, we can trust no one, but may brittania raise up and rule supreme once again, may we once have our black and white tie traditions back that we have had for countless years, may we once roam our universities, shops and high street free of all restriction, may pure britishness fuel all of us, and may boris learn the lesson of his country.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Rule Brittania, they can try to ruin our traditions but they will never ruin the country of brittania.</p></p>

        <p>I am an American, but I was raised by my great-grandmother who lived through the Blitz, so I have always been more comfortable around Brits than Americans. This post resonates with me in such a profound way. My great-grandmother and her entire generation would be appalled by the wave of sentimentality that has stripped modern Britain of her dignity.</p>

        <p>I'm American, but I still relate to your post. It's sad watching the country you love getting torn down, and at such an alarming speed. The primal fear of illness is apparently the fastest way to get people to be obedient virtue signaling tattletales who live in constant fear and hate those who don't. It's gross how people are acting about this super scary virus that not even 2% die from.</p>
