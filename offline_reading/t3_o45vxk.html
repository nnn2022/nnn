    <strong>Deeply irresponsible and reckless</strong>
    <p><p>Don't scientists, epidemiologists, and researchers usually wait a period of years before touting the effectiveness of a vaccine injected into (hundreds of) millions of people? Doesn't that data usually take years to aggregate, interpret and understand in hindsight?</p>
<p>If so, why are the vaccines being touted as effective and safe barely two months out of the gate and into the market? It's almost as if the push isn't really coming from the scientists who care to do their jobs and think things through critically. All of the urgency has come from big media and big government. Rush, rush, rush. It works! Trust us!</p>
<p>I'll pass. It is deeply irresponsible and reckless to claim the effectiveness of the vaccine this early in the game because nobody - not even Big Pharma - knows what the long-term effects are, considering especially how rushed development was. It's one thing to test a vaccine on a limited number of test subjects and extrapolate from there. It's a whole other ballgame to unleash it upon millions, if not hundreds of millions of people worldwide after barely a year of development.</p>
<p>Time will tell what it leads to.</p></p>

        <p>All very true and why many of us are avoiding the vaccineâ€¦ On the flipside people are saying this technology has been in the works for decades end it was essentially premade and ready to go but that brings me to the point that it really does seem like, assuming this is not a depopulation scheme, that this plan- demic was an excuse to Essentially experiment on a very broad diverse population with what they hope and expect to be a new essentially GMO technology going forward in medicine generallyâ€¦. Totally unethical of course!  I just saw on one of the sunday morning news shows were interviewing the moderna people and they were talking about how mRNA can cure cancer and do better flu shots and combine covid with flu shot yada yada yada and how govt just ordered more of their covid vaccinations... ðŸ™„</p>

        <p>The tech has been studied a long time but not authorized for a long time - because the safety record has not been great. As i recall the only thing mRNA has actually been tried before was for cancer. And we still have cancer.</p>
<p>Worse, they repurposed the PEG nanoparticles for delivery. Those were designed for getting through the blood-brain barrier and into places other drugs can't reach</p>

        <p>Oh they didnâ€™t just rush to make this vaccine, theyâ€™ve had them and know what the effects will be. </p>
<p>They as in, the power cabal running everything. The spike protein will create (allegedly) crystal prions in the body, which leads to neurodegenerative illnesses. </p>
<p>Anyone touting the vaccine is safe is a complete moron...give it just a year or two.</p>

        <p>They got their 'efficacy' rate from a trial which wasnt even a double-blind trial, i saw a piece from pfizer saying it is essentially experimental. Then the efficacy we really want data on is ARR (absolute risk reduction) which is only 2%. But there they are - spouting bs about some other insignificant rate at 95%.!</p>

        <p>It's also irresponsible to say it's safe after only a few months too. Especially since there's a ridiculous amounts of evidence that it's nowhere near safe. They've been changing definitions a lot lately. Maybe they changed the definition of "safe" to be less about the individual and more about "the greater good". That's some shit they would do.</p>

        <p>Well since they are literally trying to kill/sterilize people... it would probably be poor marketing to advertise that up front to the people they want to use it on.</p>
