    <p><p>If that counts as a pandemic then we're in a pandemic every flu season.</p></p>

        <p>It seems like a specific tactic to me. Hype things like how easily transmissible it is. How many people have it. How many people will get it.</p>
<p>It's a deflection. Talk about that stuff instead of backing up a bit. Is it dangerous? How dangerous? If it's not that dangerous for the majority of people, then why does it matter how easily it transmits or how many people have it?</p>
<p>When talking about it, don't engage with their angle at all. All of those things mean nothing if it's not that dangerous or deadly. Rhinoviruses are common as hell, they transmit rapidly and easily, should we be terrified of those too? No, because getting infected is just annoying and inconsequential.</p>
<p>Although, at this point, lord knows...</p>

        <p>No it won't. This ain't an American only hoax, it's a global hoax.</p>
<p>Biden said if he's elected he will put mandatory masks and have a vaccine task force to make sure every American gets vaccinated. Mandatory vaccines or face consequences for something with a 99.95 % survival rate under 70, I don't think were in Kansas anymore...</p>
<p>You think in the midst of their agenda they will just stop ? Why would they create the global lockdown hoax and stop without being forced to stop ? Does this look like stopping to you ?</p>

        <p>They are on here right now spreading their bullshit with their failed attempts at logic. It's maddening. Every single "point" they think they're making is asinine and absurd. There is no understanding of basic math and science. Yet they scream at us that it is us who are stupid and ignorant. This whole thing has been a case study in how mindless and insanely idiotic the majority of the population is. These are people who don't even know how mild respiratory viruses work or that CFR and IFR are two completely different things. Hell, they don't even know things that are even more basic than that.  It is useless to try and talk to them. Nothing they say is even remotely based in any sort of common sense or reality. It is mentally exhausting and soul-crushing. They will just regurgitate the same bullshit they saw in media/online, aka the same brainwashing codes every single time. They all sound exactly the same, and I am completely sick and tired of engaging them. By now there is tons of actual science and data out there that reveals the truth, but too bad media has brainwashed them to completely ignore and dismiss all of that. Meanwhile, the media has put forth an entire army of quacks spreading junk science and misinformation and the mindless masses just blindly repeat the shit they say. This is the fecal matter that masquerades as "science" these days.  The only thing we can do now is wait. Wait for the flip to switch again and the masses be re-programmed. Wait for the day when the serological studies can no longer be ignored and the whole world will have to face the inevitable facts. Wait for the truth to prevail. It's not worth the time, the effort, and the energy to deal with these people. Just wait for this nightmare to be over and hope none of them can get away with this bullshit.</p>

        <p>By the accepted definition, we are in a pandemic. But since a lot of laypeople seem to associate the word pandemic with instant death for everyone, as opposed to just high-risk groups (in this particular virus’ case), here we are. </p>
<p>My brother told me “we haven’t been in a pandemic since the Spanish Flu” — false. Swine flu was a pandemic, among other things. He is a very smart guy, really good at math and physics, and we tend to get along well. But, unfortunately, this is generally what happens when people get a C in history and just accept whatever the media tells them as fact.</p>

        <p>Notice how convenient is the fact that COVID19 started in the vicinity of the 100 year anniversary of the spanish flu 1918-1920. Starting in 2018 massive propaganda started to spread in the mainstream media about the 100 year anniversary of the spanish flu and about how we should prepare for the next deadly pandemic. </p>
<p>After the WHO declared COVID19 a pandemic in March 2020 and the mainstream media opened the gates to COVID19 fear propaganda, most of the public were already sensitized to deadly pandemics like the spanish flu and had a subconscious bias when interpreting this new developing information.</p>
<p>Fauci in 2017 and Obama in 2015 both had similar "warnings" about a deadly flu like pandemic which could happen in 2020 or before. Both reminded their audience that we could have another spanish flu in the same "warning" speech.</p>

        <p>But hospitals and ICUs are filling up even if this is not a pandemic (or whatever you want to label it, it doesn’t matter), it’s very tough to deny such an anomalous and highly unusual strain on medical resources this time of year in areas of high population when there was no precedence for this kind of resource utilization and infection rate since the Spanish flu.  Even if you discount the survival rate, we still have to confront the fact that something is “not right “ just by looking at the hospitals in the communities where the viral spread has supposedly taken a foothold.  There’s obviously something tangible there causing a real world strain on hospital resources.  Do we listen to our experts or do we look for any reason not to listen to them?</p>

        <p>OK there is above average death count.  So automatically they're Covid deaths? Maybe, maybe not. There is nothing that definitely says 1 way or the other.  Therefore it's a hypothesis,  and anecdotal evidence.</p>

        <p>There are between 330 - 360 million people in this country.  That puts the death rate close to .04%, just like the original post says.  The latest CDC estimate on the IFR is .69%.  As of June 20th, a staggering 91% of the deaths in this country were over the age of 55.  60% were over the age of 74, close to the average life span.</p>
<p>EDIT: My mistake, the original post shows the total percentage of the population we haven't lost to Covid.  God save the 99.96% of us still left from the doomers.  The original post should say we have a 99.31% of surviving!</p>

        <p>Now it has nothing to do with deaths. We have determined the high risk groups. Pretty much got a good general idea of mortality rates for those high risk groups </p>
<p>Now everyone is freaking out over strictly total cases.  Like really freaking out.  Shit, now young people are getting it!!!!! Look at those nbers rise!!!!!  Ok, but wasn't the whole goal since day one was to keep the health care system from being overwhelmed?  Not simply locking down everyone because there are cases.</p>
<p>In Illinois here, a group of 30ish high school kids tested positive. Everyone is absolutely freaking out.  First, they highly doubtful they will need any care whatsoever. Second, they were able to identify how the group got it (party) and now they are quarantined. </p>
<p>The single way they have been telling us,without having a vaccine, to be able to open things up fully and live a normal life is test, trace, and quarantine.  Holy shit, that's exactly what they did and yet everyone is still freaking out!!!</p>
<p>Chances are this group now getting infected will have mild to no symptoms. Most will not need any medical treatment at all.  </p>
<p>Oh, but look at florida. They'reoverwhelmed.!Yeah by the high risk group we always knew about.  And you can't tell me that group are falling ill and hospitalized because the younger group souly spread it to them.  The rally cry of lockdown lovers "your killing grandma's!!!!"</p>
<p>Look at the pictures, that at risk group was out and about without a single care just as much as the younger group.  But than you say why should everyone else be free to live life and the at/risk should be forced to stay locked up?   Well, if N95 masks are good for the health care workers, than it should be good for the at risk group. If your at-risk and want to enjoy Disney, than you wear a N95.  There are way to protect the at risk people and yet still let the rest of us live a normal life</p>

        <p>"Why using the 99.96% survival chance is a stupid comparison for Corona"   </p>
<p>Point 1  </p>
<p>Instead of pretending for a second the "99.96%" survival rate is reliable, which it isnt and ill explain as simply as possible later, look to numbers that are actually true  </p>
<p>Survival Rate is actually about 96% meaning 4% of death possible. But even THIS number is dumb, which ill explain shorty why with another very simple number crunch  </p>
<p>Survival Rate is actually about 96% meaning 4% of death  is possible. It is wrong to base survival rate on an entire population because you dont rate infections or death or whatever...on people who have NEVER had the problem in the first place. If you never get Covid, then you dont get to be included in the numbers of "survivors".   </p>
<p>You can ONLY base it on those who have:  </p>
<p>A. Gotten the disease<br>
B. Survived the disease   </p>
<p>numbers for fun (rounded)<br>
Confirmed Cases: 138,000<br>
Confirmed Deaths: 3,530,000  </p>
<p>this is a 3.91% chance of DEATH if you get infected not a .04% chance   </p>
<p>Point 2  </p>
<p>“survival” rate  </p>
<p>Also silly to entirely focus on as this is the pure factor of “you didnt die though, right?” but it completely ignores the after effects such as: Permanent lung damage (due to scaring), blood clots, higher risk of strokes, embolisms, possible heart damage, and while still being researched there has been evidence of neurological issues occurring during AND after “recovery”. Sure, you have a 4% chance of Survival...but your chances, depending how bad you got it, of the above are worse. This too, will have an easy to understand comparison later.   </p>
<p>Part 2  </p>
<p>Point A  </p>
<p>Now for some comparisons to why these numbers are stupid to use and why even the Survival rate isnt the best to go by  </p>
<p>Consider the following:  </p>
<p>American Deaths in WWII: 405,339<br>
Americans In the military During WWII: 12,209,238 <br>
(I used the “final” year total in 1945 for all branches because its not realistic to go through for each year and count casualties)  </p>
<p>That would mean, IF you were fighting in WWII as an American you chance of survival was: 3.32%  </p>
<p>but to use the SAME math as the “99.96%” people the survival rate would be: 99.97% due to the following:</p>
<p>Population of the US 1945: 140M  </p>
<p>See? WWII wasn’t so bad. You had a chance to live of 99.97% (oddly...its better than your dumb Covid math. Go figure)  </p>
<p>See why that number is dumb now? No one in their right mind would downplay WWII deaths but yet we downplay the pandemic and its deaths. You cant compare people who never were in the fray to be considered Survivors...  </p>
<p>Point B  </p>
<p>But OH, we forgot about another very important number....the “Survivors”   </p>
<p>Americans Wounded  in WWII: 671,278   </p>
<p>Combined Casualties we have:  1,076,617<br>
Or the chance to come out unharmed from WWII: 91.2% <br>
but also that means the chance of death or Injury to be: 8.8%  </p>
<p>we appear to be consistently ignoring the After Affects of Covid and just because you survived doesn’t mean you're A-OK.   </p>
<p>In WWII you still had a 5.5% chance of coming out wounded to ANY degree. <br>
Good news Johnny, you lived, bad news, you're a paraplegic.   </p>
<p>Part 3</p>
<p>This part is dedicated to the TDLR. The most basic of explications as to why Comparing a Whole Population to those affected and their deaths is stupid  </p>
<p>There has been a plane accident. In this crazy world all planes have some form of accident. Of the 100 people on board 4 have died. Another 5 are injured. Survivability from plane accident: 96%   </p>
<p>Not bad all in all. Only 4 people died but would you trust a 4% chance to die on a plane? Because, when you get Corona, YOU ARE ON THIS PLANE IN ALL SCENARIOS    </p>
<p>But what if we say <br>
of the 15,000 people to come to the airport today NONE left the airport and only that one crashed and thus only 4 people died. So we have the plane death chance of: 99.9997% chance of survival. Now thats good times.   </p>
<p>The problem is...those people were not in the plane and YOU were  </p>
<p>SUPER TLDR: Condoms have a 99.99% chance to work. Thats awesome so we use them. Would you use them if there was only a 91% chance? Are you willing to chance the 9% possibility of using a condom and having a baby when 1 Bang out of 10 will give you the chance of that baby?</p>

        <p>Homie, you're not too bright, are you?</p>
<p>You CANNOT base fatality rate on "confirmed infections," because literally everyone (no, seriously... EVERYONE) agrees that for every 1 "confirmed infection," there are at least 10 *unconfirmed* infections, where people had the virus and had no idea they had it. So, they didn't get tested, and probably never will get tested.</p>
<p>How to they know that so many more people had the virus than the "confirmed cases"? Because of antibody testing. These antibody tests reveal that vast swaths of society - even those with very low actual case counts - have already had the virus, and therefore developed antibodies.</p>
<p>So if you use your very basic calculations (which don't take into account the *millions* of people who had covid-19 without being tested, but who obviously had it because they developed antibodies), then YES, you can get a 4% mortality rate.</p>
<p>But, if you take into account the 10x more cases that are actually out there (and that's a conservative estimate; many scientists think it's more like 25-50x more cases, in reality), then you get a fatality rate of more like 0.4%.</p>
<p>Even the CDC is saying a 0.6% fatality rate.</p>
<p>Seriously, you might be the only person on the PLANET who is still saying "4% fatality rate!"</p>
<p>LOL. You need to do a LOT more reading, and maybe take a few more math classes, too!</p>

        <p>ah, so you advocate for counting all deaths that occur during this time no matter the cause to be attributed to Covid if they have the disease or if they have anti bodies? Well that would be silly so I know thats not the case.   </p>
<p>but better, that, so we can have more accurate numbers, we should increase testing to anyone and everyone so we can have a more accurate number of Survival to Death ratios? cause if we can just get everyone tested then we could get out of this lock down bullony showing evidence of how not a big deal it is. More tests mean higher people can be either classified as, infected, previously infected and anti bodied up, or never infected. Its a shame too, had this been another country we probably could do that show that its not as bad as its made out to be.   </p>
<p>but this would also mean that the deaths that are being reported as Covid related arnt really covid related. Kind of like how getting stabbed wouldn't really be because of the knife, but instead, because of blood lose.   </p>
<p>More testing available would just mean we get out of this sooner because itll show its no big deal. So...lets do that and stop fucking around I suppose. but wait, if its not a big deal, why even get tested? A pickle that is. </p>
<p>so if youre idea is that EVERYONE agrees the survival rate is 99.4% (but I assume you meant 99.94%) then based on the total population of the world at 7.8B than .6% would be 46,800,000 deaths. Well that cant be right. at .06% its 4,680,000 which also cant be correct since we have only reported 600k deaths from it so far. but 600k deaths would be the .06% death chance then? which means the other 99.94% is survived accounts known or unknown to have virus.   </p>
<p>so to ahve a .6% deaths = 600k then that means 100,000,000 people have had the virus and known or didn't know vs the confirmed cases of 14,100,000. thats a hefty difference. but thats using the wrong number. its really .06% so that means  </p>
<p>if 600k deaths is 0.06% mortality rate then that means 1,000,000,000 have already had the disease to some extent.   </p>
<p>that sure is a LOT of people then to not show enough symptoms to get tested to confirm they have it But, sure, why not. 1B people have/has Covid-19 and only 600k have died. Not so bad then.   </p>
<p>but by your accounts even the highest crazy numbers that its more like 50X the amount "confirmed" that's only 705,000,000. so its *actually* more like 71X the reported cases to get to 1B real cases.   </p>
<p>Maybe we are being lied to. If 71X the number of confirmed cases are not even being tested and marked as having the disease.  That, or it hasnt infected 1B people but who is really to say?   </p>
<p>So does that mean the flu isnt as bad either? because most people who get it are not even getting it checked on? high estimate is 56M infected with flu last season with as high at 62K deaths. thats a 0.001% chance to die from flu. but if its ACTUALLY like 25X the number of people who got it then its more like 0.0004% chance. So, covid Would be worse than the flu then? By a factor of...well gosh...thousands and wouldnt be a valid way to compare the two. because one is clearly significantly less dangerous than the other which, apparently, has the ability to infect an estimated 1B people in 5-7months  </p>
<p>we could even forget all of that nonsense. instead, just enlighten me of the everyone saying this on the planet that agrees for every 1 confirmation its actually 10 or 25 or 50 and where I can find this material.</p>

        <p>Friend, I think you're bit confused here, and I'm not exactly sure why.</p>
<p>What on earth does this have to do with the total population of the world? We're talking about recorded cases and recorded deaths. Not the entire world population. Why are you making all these calculations based on the entire world population? That has nothing to do with what we're discussing! LOL!</p>
<p>Let me try to spell this out for you one more time:</p>
<p>Right now, we have 14,369,603 cases worldwide and 602,966 deaths. That comes out to a fatality rate of about 4.2%.
But, imagine that 10x as many cases have actually occurred (this is what the director of the CDC estimates, and many scientists suggest that the number is far higher than 10x.)</p>
<p>Now, the fatality rate drops from 4.2% to 0.42%. That is right between the CDC's estimate from May (0.26%) and their estimate from this month (0.65%.) </p>
<p>As time goes by and antibody testing increases, that 0.42% is only going to decrease even further. For individuals under age 60, the IFR is already estimated at 0.1%, which is pretty much the flu.</p>
<p>Anyway, this discussion is not about the flu vs. covid. It's simply about the fact that covid is not a particularly deadly disease. It's just not. There is nothing you can say or do to make it seem scarier than it is; the facts are already in, and the world is starting to wake up. Yes, covid can be particularly dangerous for extremely unhealthy people, and for the very elderly. That's why the average age of death worldwide is 80, and almost half of all deaths worldwide have occurred among patients in nursing homes. Ask yourself: If this virus is so incredibly deadly, why is the average age of death EIGHTY years old? And why are half of all deaths taking place among people who are SO WEAK and old that they literally already were in nursing homes, where people go when they're too weak and sickly to even bathe themselves or wipe their own butts?</p>
<p>The facts speak for themselves. Time to wake up, my friend.</p>

        <p>Ide be more willing to believe your number of .6% mortality rate vs the OP suggested .04%, that is where the initial difficulty of your account comes into play. But thats only a number because of the assumption that, somehow, 9 out of 10 people either, have it and dont get tested, or have it but have no idea and then never get tested. Given the chance of symptoms of any form that just doesnt seem to add up.</p>
<p>The reason I brought the flu into is because it is used a "defense" against covid's dangers. But if we can just assume that 9 in 10 people never get tested but also have Covid then we can just assume whatever we want about any other disease in the hopes that those are also less deadly.</p>
<p>the,, at least i hope so, reason people are so troubled by covid isnt even the death %, its the ease of infection. It seems to spread easier than, say, the flu which does kills a significant amount of people every year. So if it can spread that much more easily than the chance of death, while still low, would increase. Not because your individual chance of death but because the number of deaths could increase.</p>
<p>we learn something new about it seemingly every day be it how it can spread (less likely by surface to surface) to how badly it can affect someone. but even if we only focus on the chance to survive the chance of infection is so high, again if we assume somehow 9/10 dont even realize but did/do have it that it would be more "dangerous" because it can spread so far. Assuming it IS this crazy to spread then it could, if no precautions are taken, spread to "everyone". And if it did spread to everyone and the chances were 1% .42% or even OP's .04% the amount of deaths comparative to the world population would be a pretty big deal.</p>
<p>we, individually, may have a 99.6% chance to live if infected, but that number still comes out to an insane amount if we do little to stop its spread. i know you never mentioned masks or quarantine or whatever mumbo jumbo people are saying out there but it is a factor that we can squash with those tactics.</p>
<p>so either the chances to have, not just death, but ANY symptom worth getting checked on is so low it doesn't even matter (since we are assuming that 141M people have *actually* had it) or that assumption is just crazy talk. because to think that means that is even LESS risky (for get death at all) than anyone has even remotely though if that many people dont even know they had it at all.  </p>
<p>and if it is THAT much less of a risk, people who are saying this is over blown bullony should focus on the lack of symptoms vs the low death chance. i mean think about that on a post shared to people that 90/100 people wont even have a single notable symptom. and of the 10/100 to have notable symptoms less than 1 will die. Any maybe 2-4 of them will have lasting affects.   </p>
<p>seems an easier thing to Push than "see only this many die"</p>

        <p>In the UK at one point, there were 33k official COVID-19 deaths. Looking at excess death figures, the real number was more like 50k. I'd like to see a source for your extraordinary claim that doctors are being incentivized to classify deaths as COVID related.</p>

        <p>trying to count excess deaths was always a bogus figure, especially in the midst of skyrocketing suicides and poverty </p>
<p>it's extremely unscientific to suggest that excess deaths are covid just because they happen to exist</p>

        <p>Awfully kind of these chaps to do the thinking for us. What about the scientists who also went to many years of school and reach different conclusions? I guess they're just automaticaly wrong because it's not the 'consensus '? Yup that's totally how science works</p>

<p>Since you haven't done any work in science, I'd encourage you to understand how science operates. It's not a monolith of everyone saying the same thing; it's people debating things.</p>
