    <strong>Is The US Headed Towards Civil War And Chaos ?</strong>
    <p><p>You have the propaganda networks ( media ), education system, sports/entertainment industry and majority of big corporations that are pushing for the " new normal ". Defund police, defund education, cancel rent, the communist agenda seems to be the constant narrative being pushed by them.</p>
<p>A lot of anger, poverty in the US at the moment while people are being played by deep state. How does this end? You guys think Americans will unite and fight the common enemy which is the global deep state and communism or they will keep killing each other and go into shit hole status</p></p>

        <p>The people causing destruction could be put down in less than 24 hours if the government lets the guard/marines (if it came to that) loose on them. Way too many Americans want nothing to do with this shit and would demand the violence be put down. It’s already happening. Notice how many cities have maybe 1 or 2 nights of violence before being absolutely put down. Most Americans want law enforcement or the military to stop this shit. If people try to mess with neighborhoods, the neighborhoods have even more rights than businesses do about protection of life and property. Most people will bring out their guns and shoot anyone fucking with their homes without losing any sleep. The violence could be put down quick right now but some governors and mayors aren’t allowing it to be stopped.</p>
<p>My friend lives in Capitol Hill in Seattle. She works within the former CHOP or CHAZ or whatever. She says some days it’s all protestors literally just walking with signs and truly being peaceful but she says the homeless anarchist skateboard punks show up, throw rocks and shit at cops just monitoring the protests and it sets off the tear gas and escalates from there. She knows a lot of people who march for BLM that want the anarchists out but they’re violent and not easily dealt with. It would not take the National guard more than a couple hours to clear that shit out but neither the mayor or governor allows for it. </p>
<p>A vast majority of Americans want everyone to shut the fuck up and mind their business. It’ll stop when the majority has had enough. Right now it hasn’t spilled over into the places the majorities live. Expect it to end quick if it does.</p>

        <p>I think even many on the left (like me) want this to stop but right now the risk of ostracization by saying as such is really high right now. Like yes people are more important than things, but how is it okay to destroy small businesses for no reason? Those are people’s dreams that you’re literally killing. And no, ‘they have insurance’ is not a good reason.</p>

        <p>You’re in a silent majority I believe. I talked to one of my very liberal friends in San Diego who knows I lean more libertarian/conservative and she confided to me that she was so sickened by the destruction and has removed herself from several friend circles filled with psychopaths who support it all because she can’t fathom watching innocent people lose everything at the hands of these people but she’s too scared to put it online or put it out there anywhere other than amongst her more conservative friends. I can’t imagine she’s alone.</p>

        <p>I think it’s important we reach out and have private conversations about these things. People only see extremists in the news, absolute dumpster fire posts of vitriol on social media sites, and dem governors and mayors actively supporting the violence. People need to be able to have logical, less rabid and bloodthirsty takes on this without being “for” or “against” anything but actual peace and actual justice. The ones cheering on the perpetuation of the rioting and violence online are the truly sick and lost, hopefully they’ll see the error of their ways... these violent delights have violent ends, as they say</p>

<p>Calling out the guard is the last resort because it shows they have lost control of the situation.  Governors are loathe to do that even when it's clear the situation is out of control.</p>

        <p>Probably not. The hero we needed, Kyle Rittenhouse, probably single handedly ended the violent rioting in Kenosha. All these BurnLootMurder idiots and Antifa/Bernie Sanders campaign (same organization) are playing revolution LARPing Game of Thrones battle scenes in the street. Americans like Rittenhouse are done with their games destroying our livelihoods. He gave them a taste of the war they've been asking for. There are hundreds of thousands of Kyle Rittenhouses out there ready to snuff out BurnLootMurder and their Antifa pals the minute they riot in the wrong city.</p>

        <p>Nah. Police will arrest the people stopping rioters, and arrest people who don't social distance and whatever else, but rioting? Nah, that's fine. Mayors orders.</p>

        <p>Not in my city thankfully. They put that shit down quick. Couple jewelers shot some attempted looters in Scottsdale back in May and the government shook their hands and told them to have a nice day and keep it up. Not all cities/states handle this shit equally.</p>

        <p>Civil unrest, maybe. Small militias of extremists sparring like we currently have, but taken a bit further, maybe (I woudn't call that a civil war), but in the current state of the US I fail to see how a widespread Civil War would occur. We're too interconnected and, unlike the US in the 1800s, most of us are food secure and financially secure (and no, not being able to buy the latest iPhone doesn't mean you live in poverty like most of reddit seems to think).</p>

        <p>I believe things are only going to get worse. I feel like a war will happen. So many Liberals and Conservatives are sick of each other, and the media and people who run the world are intentionally pushing for hatred and divsion. There's plenty of men and women who are sexist, different races who can't stand others, different religions who resent others, even straight people and gays and bisexuals who hate each other, and generation bashing where people place blame on generations besides theirs and act like they're the problem. Now, the virus is added to the list because we've got people who think it's a deadly plague and who want restrictions and lockdown, and people like us. Add all of the negative effects of lockdown to this, and it's really not pretty. I think people's anger, stress, and fear will build up and there will be a war. I also believe that most people (worldwide, not just here) are sheep, which means they don't know what's really going on. By the time enough people realize it, if they even do; it's going to be too late. Then, the New World Order will truly take over.</p>

        <p>Unity against anything isnt really how civil wars work. Whatever the underlying causes may be, you can rest assured that whatever comes out of the end will at best be only poorly related to the desires of the people going in.</p>
