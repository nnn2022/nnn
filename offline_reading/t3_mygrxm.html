        <p>So that study finds a 10-20% increase in cancer mortality in the UK. There were 166K cancer deaths in the UK in 2020. There have been over 100K deaths from covid in the UK.</p>
<p>So more people have died due to covid than due to a lack of cancer treatment. Thanks for linking a study that proves my point!</p>

        <p>First off, these are only two types of cancer.</p>
<p>Second, you can't use the number of covid deaths with lockdowns as an argument <strong>for</strong> the lockdowns, they are clearly an argument <strong>against</strong>. The only thing one could possibly claim is that the panic measures saved a certain small number of lives, which you could potentially infer by comparing the total mortality in similar states such as California and Florida, or Peru and Brazil. It then becomes obvious that the lives potentially "saved" are a tiny single digit percentage of all covid deaths, and that is what should be compared to the deadly destruction of the measures.</p>
<p>Third, public health experts do not count heads, they count QALYs, and an average cancer casualty loses a lot more than the average covid casualty.</p>

<p>Big man aren’t you, talking so tough behind your keyboard. How absolutely pathetic! </p>
<p>&rt; First off, these are only two types of cancer.</p>
<p>Did the number of cancer deaths increase by 100K last year? No? So obviously there were not more cancer deaths due to lack of treatment than there were covid mortalities, regardless of cancer type. You don’t even need the linked study to see that.</p>
<p>&rt; Second, you can't use the number of covid deaths with lockdowns as an argument for the lockdowns, they are clearly an argument against.</p>
<p>If covid is as harmless as you say, why are patients taking beds away from people who need cancer treatment? Maybe because it truly is a deadly disease and those people needed immediate treatment?
You guys don’t have a single good argument against lockdown, so I’m gonna continue listening to public health experts and not ignorant conspiracy theorists on reddit. It’s hilarious to watch you guys spam the downvote button in your little safe space here. Everyone else is laughing at you 😘</p>

        <p>&rt;If covid is as harmless as you say, why are patients taking beds away from people who need cancer treatment?</p>
<p>When did I ever say Covid-19 was harmless? If you had basic reading comprehension you probably would not want to argue with me at all, because we'd be of the same opinion.</p>
<p>Covid is not taking beds from cancer patients, that is not the reason cancer is being neglected. Hospitals have been burdened with more patients during the height of the pandemic, true, but at no location did that last for the entire time of the pandemic, and it was comparable to the load during flu season from previous years. We've seen the juxtaposed reports for overwhelmed hospitals for 2010 through 2020, covid did not introduce anything unseen before. </p>
<p>The real reason for neglecting other diseases is lockdowns, panic and fear. It's unnecessary and pointless procedures (airing the room for an hour between patients, or scrubbing surfaces, which has crippled capacity). It's reducing capacity by not using beds for fear of infection spread. I strongly doubt that hospitals in the first world are built to such shoddy standards that they cannot operate normally in flu, or whatever infection, season.</p>
<p>You think you hold the high ground by licking the boots of your masters, but you're really complicit in murdering cancer patients, destroying lives and livelihoods, subjecting women and children to violence during the lockdowns, damaging education, annihilating small business, hospitality and culture.</p>

        <p>Damn, you really drank all the kool-aid, didn’t you? The irony of someone like you telling me I have poor reading comprehension is rich. Thanks for the entertainment, I hope you get help because you’re clearly off the deep end. I really hope you don’t shoot up a hospital or influence someone else to with your dangerous rhetoric.</p>

        <p>Fauci and his family get death threats because of people like you. People died at the capitol insurrection because of people like you. So yes, words can be dangerous when they’re used to radicalize people. If you’re too dense to understand that, then surely you’re too dense to understand global health care decisions.</p>
<p>I remember when the line was, “everyone will stop caring about the pandemic once the November 2020 election is over” and how obviously untrue that was. It’s amazing how you guys get proven wrong time and time again. Pizzagate, The Kraken, coronavirus hoax, all such obvious bullshit and yet you guys keep coming back for more.</p>
<p>The only “NPCs” are you mouth-breathers who believe these obvious lies and regurgitate it in your little cesspools.</p>

        <p>So fuck all the people that died from the flu before covid came round? Even though it is mild for most people. Where were you with your mask to protect the elderly from the flu? Do you know how many patients I lost every year when the flu showed its ugly head? </p>
<p>I'm a nurse and I see no (big) difference between the flu and covid. They both really really suck for some unfortunate people. I am not saying covid is not bad and we should say fuck you to the people who are at risk. But do you seriously still believe this is some mega killer virus and we are going about this the right way?</p>

<p>Well yes, I believe that hundreds of thousands of people died from covid. I’d call that a mega killer. Your personal anecdotes mean jack shit compared to actual data.</p>

        <p>&rt;Show me where people were dying from the flu in numbers anywhere near covid mortalities.</p>
<p>We register a lot of people as covid deaths who didn't necessarily died from covid or some did but there is some nuance to it.
Let me give you an example. I have had clients bed ridden for weeks, near death but not nearly there, they got sick and died. In that case covid (or the flu) was the last push and a blessing to the patient and their families. This is just one example.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the pcr test does not detect covid perse. I don't know how to explain it in english cause it is not my native language but basically it detects if you are sick but it can't see the covid perse (I hope that makes sense).</p>
<p>Nowadays everyone who is sick gets tested with pcr test. You can be positive and have either flu or covid or whatever but they all put the positives as covid. Nobody gets tested for the flu anymore ( that's why it dissapeared, it is still there but we don't test for it anymore so don't find it). It could very well be we have half the people positive from corona and half from the flu or whatever virus.</p>

        <p>I gave you the benefit of the doubt because you have no way of knowing whether or not I support every theory on here, so why would you accuse me of blindly trusting them?  Now I know you are just tarring us all with the same brush, because that is easier for you, it’s easier for you to put every person you disagree with into a neat little box you can dismiss.  As for a ‘selfish agenda’, not at all, I would love to believe the covid measures actually worked and weren’t monstrous, I would love to be on the same side as my friends on all this rather than constantly worrying that if they found out my true political views, they would want nothing to do with me.  The one with a selfish agenda here is you, you just want to feel good about yourself by coming onto this sub and giving all these baddies a piece of your mind.</p>

        <p>Exactly. No body knows how many people are dying of this and all the other health effects caused by the lockdowns. Yet here we are. It's very ironic for lockdown proponents to suggest that their policies are based on science. </p>
<p>One other thing I'll say is that death rate is not the correct way to measure the impact of a virus. As a thought experiment, consider a virus with a 100% infection and kill rate, but only activates minutes before you would have died from other causes. This virus would kill billions, yet it would be inconsequential. COVID kills people with pre-existing conditions. Abscess teeth will kill you whether you're 80 or 20. That's a significant impact on life expectancy.</p>

<p>I hope they work but meanwhile here we are, just sharing the side effects makes you an anti vax and everyone thinks that these vaccines will work 100%, when we just don't know. </p>
<p>Why there's not the same amount of money trying to make effective early treatments or to help long covid patients? Sadly my guess here is that there's a different agenda in the background. </p>
<p>Source: I got Covid, I had no treatment, then Long covid, again: no treatment and finally, they want me to take this vax. Hell no.</p>

        <p>What is up with the false comparisons? </p>
<p>You should eat healthy for your long term health but if the plate of food in front of you is poisonous you should wait until another time. You should stay fit so your body functions into later years (you don’t die from unfit-you just live in pain for longer) but exposing yourself to pathogens to get a pump is not the way. </p>
<p>More to the point heart disease is chronic to a culture. We’ve seen it to the charts for decades. It’s stable in a horrible way.  COVID came from nowhere, wasn’t on the chart, and stormed the field to top three in one season. Heart disease is an always problem this is a now problem. It’s one of the worst wars America has ever faced. We have to win.</p>

        <p>It's the highest <em>contagious</em> disease death rate in the US, so if you aren't careful, there's a higher risk of catching it and <em>spreading it to others</em>, and possibly dying than getting cancer or heart disease which aren't contagious.

        <p>No shit... it’s inevitable that asbestos is used even if it’s illegal/banned. But the point they made is that it’s not banned, which as far as I know it is. So the point you tried to make doesn’t make sense</p>

        <p>Which is why the use in Asia skyrocketed after SARS-1? Every reference I’m seeing looking it up includes limiting the spread of disease and stopping snot flying around as a major reason. </p>

<p>That’s just looking in Asia. They’ve had pandemic threats there already and America helped pay for them to research the best way to fight a virus that spreads airborne. Then trump closed the pandemic response task force, threw away south Koreas epidemic handbook (that America paid for), fired all out doctors in China, and defunded the WHO. </p>
<p>It’s simple childish common sense that a mask will slow the spread of an airborne agent. When SARS-1 hit people in Asia (where culture is geared more toward family and sacrifice) were quick to adopt the simple tool that saved lives. And it worked-we had 8 cases in America because they stopped the spread in Asia.</p>

<p>That’s an interesting study. I wasn’t tested for MMR until recently and only just came in under the threshold of immunity for measles only. My mumps vaccine from childhood is holding strong. </p>

        <p>The Covid vaccine was tested laterally and vastly more than any other vaccine you have in your body. It also operates differently. The old vaccines were actually putting virus body into you-this note mRNA technique will change medicine forever if people will ever get on board fighting the good fight. -at this rate America never reach herd immunity and we’ll all need booster shots every year.</p>

        <p>Also - most COVID deaths are not really preventable. The majority of people dying had multiple co-morbidities and were elderly. Meanwhile, people are dying young from preventable illnesses like heart disease, obesity, and even drug overdoses. But for some reason our leaders think it is fine to ignore all that if we can 'stop' COVID deaths... Pure bullshit. How anyone still believes their lies I have no idea.</p>

        <p>It is banned! Which it is just as plausible that despite the ban it was still being used in a manner known to cause long-term health issues up to and including death. 
I only used the gun metaphor because, even though guns are not currently banned, they are causing enough undue harm to "warrant" a ban. The big connection is that simply banning something will not automatically solve the bigger problems....

        <p>Most other diseases have some form of cure and even if they don't, they aren't pandemic. Besides, functional members of society can focus on more things at a time. It's not that just because news media is only reporting on covid as of lately that other diseases aren't getting attention from medical professionals. Not like I expect your lot to wrap your heads around the idea but c'est la vie.</p>
