        <p>They’ve been pushing this down government official’s throats too in places like Seattle. This shit is gonna backfire big time and usher in new levels of segregation. People simply will not ever put themselves in positions to be around people who expect this of them and it’ll cause a bigger chasm. They have no idea what they’re unleashing with this.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Its absurd. It's like these places are regressing backwards thriugh history with the segregation type of shit. The scary thing is, the evergreen stuff that another person posted, this seems more bizarre, it's not even the kids as far as it looks, it's the people who run the college lol idk. Its getting crazy.</p>

        <p>Eh...you only see commentary from those still playing the game. When all the BLM insanity and “silence is violence” shit started, people just bailed from any kind of social media and closed ranks. The amount of gun sales in May and June is all you need to know about what people really think about all this. They’re preparing to defend their lives and property against the heathens trying to burn everything down. The kind of shit above is a last ditch ever to indoctrinate whoever they can but ultimately most people forced to sit through this drivel will still go home at night and load their gun and put it by the door. You can talk this shit AT people but it doesn’t mean you’re getting them on board.</p>

        <p>We hear this all the time at /stupidpol.  It’s probably a Robin DiAngelo program.  My favorite critique of the program (as you described) is from John McWhorter</p>
<p>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/dehumanizing-condescension-white-fragility/614146/</p>
<p>A good doc series on a very intense version of this at Evergreen College is by Benjamin Boyce.  There’s even a scene where the kids shriek at the cooks.... I’ll have to look for it, if interested in.</p>

<p>My take is the only way to survive is to play their game.     Their keep changing the rules, so you cannot fight fair. :(</p>

        <p>I'll check the article and video out. Err, and send them to my friend... yeah its pretty sick shit, and theres no way around it. Hes gonna have to find a new job asap I guess. I don't think any of the few people disagreeing at the meeting are gonna fare very well either in regards to keeping their job. Clearly they don't want diversity of thought only visual diversity. Like some type of weird human Noah's ark. </p>
<p>The most ironic part was when she apparently talked about how far the LGBT community has come, which is true, but immediately after asked for an Amen and referred to the meeting as a church lol</p>
<p>The forced vax and constant testing is ridiculous too. I mean, forcing the flu vaccine too? Wtf are we doing here. Clearly just a pandering thing but its something weve all seen coming. No vaccine,  no job.</p>

        <p>I appreciate it and I will. Theres apparently a part 2 to this meeting coming up, so there will be more to discuss. I'm watching the evergreen video now, what's weird about this college in question,  is that it seems to be coming from the president and the higher ups there, like I've said it's a predominantly white school, and they've openly said, in the meeting, that they are actively looking to get more diversity of color. Which, i personally dont give a shit what color anyone is or how many of what ethnicity there is attending the school. But I can just imagine how crazy it may get, just like evergreen, if they're trying to attract more people to the college with the same radical views of literally treating others differently according to their race.</p>

        <p>I saw some weird anti-racist stuff when I was lurking on the teachers sub. Its so bizarre. It was almost like “Lets see who can be the <em>least</em> racist.” It was so disingenuous. </p>
<p>I am someone who has truly worked at making the world a better place for my fellow humans. I stand up for what is right and advocate for those without a voice. I know, in my heart of hearts that I am a good person. But something about this BLM thing doesnt sit right with me. </p>
<p>I was brutally attacked online the first day of the George Floyd protests, for not changing my profile picture to a black square. It pissed me off. You know what I was actually doing that day...instead of sitting policing peoples facebook virtue signaling, I was out at a memorial for Floyd. After that whole incident, the bullying and virtue signaling escalated. It has literally been all the younger, rich, white women (who are all about staying in lockdown indefinitely) who are shouting “Black Lives Matter!” on social media (the safety of their home, probably wearing a mask on their couch, too.) </p>
<p>Anywho, that is when I realized that many of these people truly dont even care. Its as if they have guilt or something, and they are trying to rectify it by judging people. </p>
<p>And while I understand that protests and riots are an important avenue for real change—a lot of what I am seeing from this whole charade (at least in my area) seems to be laying the groundwork for more hate &amp; division.</p>

        <p>Yeah absolutely. It's the "look at me, I'm the least racist!" Game. These online freaks don't care if you were doing something genuinely in the name of george floyd or anything like that, they only want to hear your agreement with them. Its ridiculous. I agree it's all about division at this point, even back to the original point of this post, they want to divide the "good" whites and the "bad" whites. Idk. Not a fan of where this is going...</p>

        <p>Exactly. From what I've read, huge colleges are only testing people if they have symptoms. This particular school seems to have a big agenda. Plus, they had to pay for damages to dorms after kids left earlier this year, plus they paid extra money for the staff, the staff was only required to work 20 hours, but got paid for 40 and the college paid the other 20 hours worth of work. Which was nice of them to do, but they're literally throwing away money at this point,  and I don't even imagine the full capacity of kids will be coming back.</p>

        <p>I've been following social justice for years.  None of this surprises me.</p>
<p>In fact, the CV response to me is the culmination of what social justice has wrought upon society: protect and shield victims, always at the great expense of everyone else.</p>

        <p>See. What I dont understand is, what's gonna happen to these coddled kids when they go into the real world after college and see that not everyone is an sjw like they've learned, and no matter what you're gonna run into assholes. Just like the whole anti bullying stuff. I mean, that didn't work, people still, and will always get bullied, you cant force people to think differently,  some people with genuinely be racist no matter what, it's not ok, but thought policing isnt gonna change that. Fuck those people and move on with your life.</p>

        <p>Yep. They don't get to physically come to school then. Apparently some kids are "remote learning" but they also have a separate dorm set up for infected kids. They're actually forcing kids to live on campus,  which cause a little bit of a problem with some kids being forced to break leases they've already signed. That sounds like it wont look too good for the school.</p>

        <p>This kind of anti-racism training is a booming industry.  That person is being paid several thousand dollars a day to stand in a room and accuse everyone else of being racist. Defensiveness or argument is taken as proof of racist beliefs. These "educators" submit a report to your supervisor naming all the "racist" employees so they can be constructively dismissed to avoid danger of future litigation. There is literally no way to win except to prostrate yourself before your black/brown savior and beg forgiveness for your racial sins.</p>
<p>Interesting how the covid authoritarianism narrative has dovetailed neatly into this rigid racial ideology.</p>

        <p>Yes. Its very interesting. Its almost as if they're serving a cocktail of SJW ideas and quite literally forcing it down everyone's throats. See, I figured they would be singling out the people who were against it, one guy apparently said "I think everyone has an opportunity to succeed " and the womans response was "you really believe that?" No discussion or examples or sources, that was it, pretty much just "you're an idiot" type response. I feel bad for what they're gonna try to pull to get that guy out of there.</p>

        <p>That really sucks. I feel sorry for your friend. Something puzzles me though. Do US colleges truly have the right to oblige their personnel and their staff to be vaccinated? In Quebec, Canada, where I'm from, it would be a provincial mandate to my knowledge. Universities, which are public, would apply the rule like any other institution or organization due to the provincial government's law. I don't see how private institutions could enforce a medical procedure like vaccination if it's not demanded by the state.</p>
