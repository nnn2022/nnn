    <strong>Here’s how I’m preparing for the threat of job loss.</strong>
    <p><p>I will preface this by saying I’ve been preparing since 2018 but don’t let that be the reason you disregard what I am about to share. </p>
<p>Prepare. </p>
<p>They will threaten you with employment and entertainment. Why? Because they know we’re all burdened with debt and addicted to entertainment. It’s a tool. Rather than throwing up your hands when your employer sends the dreaded mandate email, get strategic. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You look to line up another job which allows you to be remote. I know everyone cannot do this but if you can, it’s worth it. Since the market is balancing The Great Resignation, I encourage you to negotiate for a remote position that is only subject to a negative test should you need to be on site. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stock up on your critical medications. If you have a lapse of employment, you may have a lapse in insurance. Not fun. Visit your doctor and get advances on your prescriptions. Get cold, fever and pain meds while you can and have a paycheck. You don’t want to be in a situation where you can’t take care of your essential medical needs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversify your income. Somewhere in the last generation, we started pushing the idea that only the super heroes of us are able to balance life and a side hustle. Total BS. You have skills. Don’t fall for the garbage idea that you’re useless unless a corporation hires you. Start revving up your side hustle now - before you need it. This may be what you need to keep afloat as things get spicy over the coming months. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy basic foods now. Not boxed dinners and fancy pasta. I’m talking a nice 10 pound bag of rice and dry beans. Buy things that can keep you fed for 90 days while the market rages with all of the mandates, terminations and resignations. You have energy to resist when you know you can feed yourself that evening. This is the long game and it’s better to have food stored away that’s boring as heck than to be hungry. You’d be surprised how much $30 can get you of boring bulk food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start improving your health. I know no one wants to talk about this but your health is critical especially in a supposed pandemic. Treat your body well so that no matter what comes through the biological warfare - I mean virus - pipeline, you have a better chance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a yard or a patio, start growing food. Most people who have never grown food don’t realize how I I time it takes to grow food. Before you say, “I don’t have enough space to grow food to life on” you can start with where you are and what you have today. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not resign early. Don’t do it. You need everything in your favor when lawsuits start flying. Do not answer any questionnaires about your status, do not answer inquiries as to if you are vaccinated. Simply say; “ I do not wish to share that information with you.” They will fire you if they are serious. Don’t let that surprise you and do not act out. Ask them to give you a reason in writing and ensure that it says they were unwilling to make accommodation for either religious, medical or any other exemption, work from home arrangement or any other accommodation. Get it all in writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polish your resume now. It may seem pointless but when you need it, you need it immediately. Better ready than behind. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear off as much debt as you can. I cannot stress this enough. We are in this situation because they know we all carry so much debt, we couldn’t even stop working 60 days without self destructing our finances. With whatever means you have, start aggressively paying off debt. For every creditor that isn’t knocking at your door every week, the better off you will be. Start switching those basic monthly services like your cell phone Bill to budget service providers like cricket mobile. You want to be as financially unshackled as possible so you aren’t carrying a full load as this all goes down. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid mandating companies like the plague. If you keep giving them money, they can continue asking for whatever they’d like. Let the people who serve their agenda prop up their share price. Go back to small businesses who already have fury because they’ve been destroyed by all of this. If they require a mask, skip them. If they mandate their employees, skip them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organize. A bunch of unemployed people on the streets of major cities can give some much needed visibility. This isn’t one of those “watch from the bleachers” fights. You need to be actively participating in screaming “no” to the high heavens - and the White House.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not bend your consent because someone has you in a corner. An assailant will always tell you that you brought their assault upon yourself. </p>
<p>Prepare, don’t bend because they threaten you. Or you will never get your personal freedom back.</p></p>

        <p>Nice. Thanks...</p>
<p>Also an important point:<br>
 Create an emergency bag/bugout kit. With a water filtering device, small tent, various ropes, knife, extra glasses, socks, flash lights, gloves, underwear, hat, sun glasses, and not to mention a piece of paper or two (laminated) which have your usernames and passwords for various accounts you may need access to).</p>
<p>Having it just in case is necessary. Who knows what the future holds. And its handy just in case of an earthquake, anyway, so might as well!</p>

        <p>Thank you for this! Iv been starting to buy food, starting to bow hunt, bought trap lines, fishing, and now raising chickens. I'm looking to acquire a pig and will be growing a large winter garden. I also have been building guns, and buying gold and silver. I work for the state of CA and am in military reserves. I will be losing both jobs here soon. I see the writing on the wall. I wish I prepped sooner.</p>

        <p>We all do. But you are now. </p>
<p>I’m stacking metals too because I don’t trust the dollar or our monetary future. Good idea. I’m turning my yard into a garden and luckily since I’m in Texas, I plant twice a year. I have crazy ambitions of large acres, solar power and a water source but that’s years away. For now, I want to ensure I can survive winter if I’m unemployed.</p>

        <p>Hell yea brother! Have you heard of Jim Bakker's buckets? It's all the food prep you'll need for your freedom shelter. And the best part is after you eat all the food out of a bucket, you can place a toilet seat on top to use it as a latrine. And its a great way to get some extra prayer time in.</p>

        <p>If I might suggest another strategy, do not admit you are unvaccinated. Simply refuse to answer the question. Stick to privacy grounds. There is a larger pool of people who are either pro-privacy OR unvaccinated, than merely unvaccinated.</p>
<p>If you say you are unvaccinated, you are labeled as dumb. They will convince themselves you don’t belong at their company.</p>
<p>If you say you don’t want to share medical information with your employer, you are in good company. Pregnant women don’t want their employer to know because they have been denied promotions over pregnancy or the mere possibility of pregnancy. People with chronic illnesses faced discrimination over the costs of healthcare or accommodations until they got ADA protections. Guess who has a medical exemption from vaccines? People with serious medical issues that don’t want their employer to know.</p>
<p>Merely admitting you have a medical exemption reveals information that some employers can and have used to discriminate against people. Don’t answer the question.</p>
<p>Medical information should be off limits to employers. Period.</p>
<p>That is the hill I’ll die on. The more of us on that hill, the harder it will be for employers to enforce mandates.</p>
<p>One final piece of advice: don’t quit. Make them fire you, in writing. Your lawyer will want that letter for your damages trial.</p>

        <p>Not really. Youre letting your beliefs steer you into hardships and when you can't find work due to covid vaccination requirements you'll blame the government, pharma, society, msm, social media whatever. When in reality everyone (the wealthy and poor and everyone in between) need the world to continue as it did prior to 2020.</p>

        <p>No, some people in a different forum said how nonsensical you folks are and I saw your thread on "here's how to survive now that you refuse to get the vaccine" lol. It's childish and in poor faith. There's no reasoning with people like you who believe the govt is consistently acting in bad faith. You guys almost dream of a dystopia collapse of society. </p>
<p>Vaccine= if you get covid there's a 99% change you won't have a tube shoved down your throat. Mask= limit aerosol transmission. It's literally that simple. And we're going to probably shut down again because of people like you. </p>
<p>This isn't that difficult to understand but youre making your life potentially unnecessarily difficult. You really think you're going to get by on rain water growing vegetables and raising animals?</p>

        <p>I'm not on anyone's team other than empirical data. And empirical data supports the vaccines so far. Unless you can see in the future then just shut the fuck up lol.</p>
<p>You chose not to get vaccinated. And now cities/counties/states/private companies will start impose safety measures that won't cater to your illogical medical choices. So don't start feeling like a victim when life gets more difficult. Bathe in the glory of your ignorance you earned it bud.</p>

<p>the death rate of covid is so low that with 44k test subjects, there's NO EVIDENCE the vaccine is effective at reducing covid death. p-val 0.28.
the risk of fatal heart problems is higher in people who took the vaccine (p-val .95 to .97) than covid without the vaccine (again, p-val .28)</p>

        <p>Yes there are a lot of local rules on limiting the percent increase on property taxes so it’s worth getting land. Also, you could collect rain water, set up solar, etc. you get a lot more sustainable options on your own land than you will with a corporate land lord. If you have a mom/pop, it’s better than these monasterios companies buying up everything.</p>

        <p>So get the vaccine lol. 160m ppl have in the US. Three deaths associate with just the vaccine. A little over 5k ppl got covid who have it. Again that's 3 out of 160,000,000 people and 5,000 out of 160,000,000. </p>
<p>Or yeah go become homeless and make your life extraordinarily difficult because you have some reservations. Which is completely fine to be worried. But talk to your doctor instead of strangers on the internet. I trust the science. I think the folks with phds in chemistry and biology who have been working on a Sars vaccines for years (the vaccine isn't something they just made in the past year) are doing so with the best for humanity in mind.</p>

        <p>You haven't analyzed jack shit. I've actually looked at the data and odds are a lot of people who took this are going to wind up with antibody dependent enhancement, just like the animals in the original SARS vaccine trials. And guess what? Actual fucking scientists who aren't being paid by the pharma companies like Luc Montagnier are screaming the same thing. </p>
<p>And aww boo hoo, the wittle fascist who wants giant corporations to do the dirty work of the government to force people to submit to a medical procedure that makes big government donors rich doesn't like being called out for the fascist he is.</p>

        <p>Lmao. Luc Montagnier also believes electromagnetic radiation can cure Lyme disease. Doesn't surprise me bat shit crazy people like yourself will follow the opinions of this guy verse the actual numbers since we started vaccinating. No wonder you're so angry. You created this warped view of reality than any rationality feels like an attack lol </p>
<p>Fascism would be you being forced to take the shot. No one is forcing you to take the shot. I'll say this again because apparently you're too wrapped up in your self induced rage; I don't care if you get it. Just don't be a little bitch when companies and people refuse to deal with you :)</p>

<p>Yes three deaths due to blood clots from the jj vaccination. I did read the vaers report. And those deaths are inconclusive. But sure let's say those 12k were solely because of the vaccine. </p>
<p>All I'm saying is don't cry when your life gets increasingly difficult because of your choices.</p>

        <p>&rt;Start improving your health. I know no one wants to talk about this but your health is critical especially in a supposed pandemic. Treat your body well so that no matter what comes through the biological warfare - I mean virus - pipeline, you have a better chance.</p>
<p>This is the biggest one. I can offer 3  key pieces of advice here that will make the biggest difference possible in a short amount of time. 1. Cut your carbs in half. Get most of your energy from protein and fat. You don't need carbs in your diet at all. Period. There is no such thing as an essential carb. Stop having desert, just cut it out, within a week your sweet tooth will reset and you won't crave it.Cut back on bread. Even fruits these days are bred to be full of sugar so they're competitive with candy. A high carb diet will impair weight loss (insulin in your blood will actively prevent the body from breaking down fat.), insulin resistance will lead to diabetes and vascular damage starting you down the pathway to disease, and encourages fluid retention increasing blood pressure and cardiac workload (heart failure) 
2. Stop drinking anything that isn't water, a no calorie caffeine drink of your choice, and protein if you're training heavily. I promise you don't need anything else. It's just empty calories. Juice for Vit C? Eat half a bell pepper. Milk for Calcium/Vit D? Fish, just do a spoonful of cod liver oil or tuna. </p>
<ol>
<li>Train. Do it constantly. I promise if you've never done a fitness plan in your life and you're starting from the couch, you'll never "overtrain." Take a rest day if you're really suffering but know your muscle soreness 2-3 days after you work out is natural and will get better as you move. 30 minutes of cardio a day. Get your heart rate in the 130s. Don't bother with HIIT training, most people never do it properly and hit 100% anyway, and constant staye cardio burns more calories. And any sort of weight lifting is grand for a whole host of reasons. Look up a beginner powerlifting program. Muscle will increase your metabolism to burn more fat. </li>
</ol>
<p>In the end I promise, general FITNESS is dead simple. Calories in, calories out. If you eat less calories than you burn in a day you will lose weight. You cannot exercise your way out of a bad diet.</p>

        <p>&rt;Stock up on your critical medications.</p>
<p>Solid advice. Up in Canada, the rule is that your insurance will only cover it if you are getting a refill after 70% of the expected time to get a refill. For example, if you fill a prescription for 30 days, you can get another refill for 30 days after waiting only 21 days. Getting 30 days worth of stuff every 21 days allows you to stockpile things and have it still be covered by insurance.</p>

        <p>All good advice, thank you for sharing. Along with buying basic foods, I think growing your own food will be essential. There’s lots of foods that regrow if you cut to the base like leafy greens and onions. Perennial seeds are ideal to buy because you don’t have to keep buying seeds, and get seeds from your annuals before they die so you don’t have to rebuy seeds.</p>
<p>You can dehydrate, can, and jar fruits and veggies in a variety of ways for food storage. With buying basic foods and maintaining a garden, you’ll save money and stay healthy.</p>

        <p>Agree on absolutely all of this but #9 is paramount.</p>
<p>I have been debt-free for over 20 years, and what I can now do because of that, 80% of the people I know cannot.</p>
<p>I can support myself without any help from anyone for at least 4 years with what I have in the bank, and that's living well. If I live minimally, I have 6 years of money in cash. On top of that, if I liquidate my investments, I'm good until I'm dead.</p>
<p>I have credit cards that I use every month due to getting a 1.5% cash back on everything I buy, but I pay them off. Every. Month.</p>
<p>Debt will cripple your choices. Being debt-free sets you physically and mentally free.</p>
<p>Stop buying things you don't need, and stop giving your money to companies that don't deserve it.</p>
<p>Money is power and the more you have of it, the more powerful you are. Even if that just means the power you have is to tell your employer "Go fuck yourselves" when they mandate an experimental vaccine.</p>

        <p>Or ya know, just get the shot to lower your risk of hospitalization if you get it and wear a mask to limit aerosol transmission. Or yeah start buying rice and beans and pick up side hustles lol. As long as you don't complain about the consequences of your choices do as you please!</p>
