        <p>The poison is in the dose. Nothing is toxic if you have a small enough amount of it; everything is toxic if you have too much of it. Ban dihydrogen monoxide. Neglecting this is the fallacy which drives most of this list. </p>
<p>Based on the usage of natrium instead of sodium, I suspect the author was German. I attempt to translate the names below into their accepted named, in case anyone wants to research them further. </p>
<p>Note that this list is not the ingredients of a single vaccine strain. Some of these ingredients are present in the J&amp;J vaccine, while others are in the Astra-Zeneca one, among the ingredients that I’ve identified are explicitly linked to a particular vaccine. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>2-phenoxyethanol occurs naturally in green tea, so it seems perfectly safe to me, even if it also has antifreeze properties. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aluminum is indeed tied to MS et. al. <em>in ridiculously high doses</em>. Let me guess — you don’t put on deodorant either, since it has minute amounts of aluminum in it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fetal bovine serum</em>. The stuff doesn’t necessarily come from aborted cows, but it’s certainly from fetuses, as the name implies. It’s still an open question how much the fetus suffers from the blood extract. Anyway, note this one’s a moral objection, not a scientific one. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formaldehyde indeed causes cancer, but so does the sun. More importantly is that formaldehyde scores a 3 on the health hazard section of the fire diamond. However, notice that it also has an LD₅₀ of 100 mg/kg. I think it’s fair to assume the amount in vaccines is closer to μg levels and therefore is reasonably safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gelatin. I fail to see the problem here. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human albumin. I similarly fail to see the problem here. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More commonly called monosodium glutamate, MSG has long been blamed for any number of health issues. It’s a myth. MSG is perfectly fine, and both sodium and glutamate are essential nutrients in the human diet. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MRC-5 cells. First of all, this is false. While MRC-5 is used in many vaccines, including the hepatitis A vaccine, it’s not actually in the COVID shots. Instead a different fetal line is used, HEK 293. Second of all, some clarification on the history of these lineages: a single baby boy was aborted in 1966, and his cells were cultured and reproduced. These cells’ descendants are still used today, and they are the MRC-5 line. The HEK line comes from an aborted girl in 1973 and otherwise shares an identical history. Third of all, this is once again an ethical concern, not a scientific one. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neomycin. You can get this over the counter as Neosporin cream. Yes, it’s an antibiotic. Next. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polymyxin B. Brand name is Poly-Rx. Also an antibiotic. Next. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polysorbat 80. It’s a common emulsifier, which means it surrounds fatty compounds to allow them to be carried away by a water-based solution (like your blood). It’s so common as a food additive it’s got an E number, E433. It has nothing to do with the blood-brain barrier. If you’re that concerned, stop eating ice cream. Because of its emulsifying properties, it’s common in vaccines, including the regular flu vaccine in some countries. Overall, I see nothing to be worried about here. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potassium chloride. Yes, it’s in lethal injections, but its LD₅₀ is 2.5 g/kg. The amount that’s in the vaccines won’t harm you; you get more potassium chloride in your food. In fact, these are essential nutrients. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potassium phosphate. Same story; you get plenty of this in your diet, and they’re still essential nutrients. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sodium tetraborate is indeed commonly called Borax and is indeed an insecticide. While we’re at it with the scare tactics, it’s also used in laundry detergents and bleach alternatives. It has the E number E285 and is actually banned in the US as a food additive (in other countries it’s a preservative or texturing agent), due to its linkage to liver cancer. <em>However</em>, it’s only dangerous in high doses over years of consumption! I told you this would be a theme: the poison is in the dose, and with an LD₅₀ of 2.66 g/kg, a single shot of this is perfectly safe. Honestly, if they did their homework, they’d find a lot better scare tactics on this one than it’s an insecticide. Also, it burns a vibrant red color; it’s actually quite a pretty flame. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sodium citrate. Nothing interesting to see here. Next. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sodium hydroxide. More commonly called lye, this stuff actually is corrosive. But once again, the poison is in the dose, and this stuff is a very common food additive, E524. It’s used in a variety of ways, from thickening ice cream to softening olives. There’s a popular treat in Germany called lye rolls; they don’t even hide that sodium hydroxide is a major part of the recipe. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>17-18. Trisodium phosphate and sodium monobasic phosphate (AKA disodium hydrogen phosphate or disodium biphosphate) are pH controllers and leavening agents in baking, emulsifiers in certain types of cheese, and a constipation remedy. At high doses in certain predisposed individuals, they can lead to severe GI issues, but nothing to worry about in the relatively small doses in food. Point is, it’s BS that it’s poisonous for cells, and once again these are essential nutrients. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sorbitol. Yeah, really not much to say. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Streptomycin. Antibiotic. Next. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeast protein. Next. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urea. Really not as dangerous as they make it sound; your kidneys regulate blood urea levels, so adding a tiny bit of urea shouldn’t harm anything. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“And other chemicals.” Water is a chemical. This doesn’t tell me anything. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>&rt; RNA works as a genetic scissor that modifies your DNA in deep. </p>
<p>That’s…not at all how RNA works. There’s a bunch of types of RNA, and none of them work that way. Relevant here is mRNA, whose job is to feed itself into the ribosomes inside your cells and trigger translation, via a mechanism involving tRNA for assembling the corresponding protein, in this case the corona spikes. </p>
<p>&rt; The FDA warns of 22+ side effects including death. </p>
<p>The important question to ask is: What are the <em>odds</em> of developing the side effects? What are the odds of serious symptoms developing if I catch COVID? Weigh those two factors, and make an informed decision for yourself. Weigh the factors we know, the factors we don’t, and make sure you check that you understand the material correctly. Like me, you might still not get vaccinated, or like others, you might get vaccinated. Either way, that’s fine — but it should be YOUR choice.</p>

        <p>Some of these look like foreign terms for ordinary chemicals and are recognizable as acceptable food additives, in small amounts, in English. Natriumfosfat = sodium phosphate. Kaliumklorid = potassium chloride, and in large amounts it <em>is</em> part of execution by lethal injection, but in much smaller amounts is also a medicine to treat hypokalemia or as a salt substitute. Mononatrium L-glutamat = monosodium glutamate aka MSG.</p>
<p>This looks intentionally sensationalized and probably not correct, especially if supposedly derived from a UK document. (and the FDA is USA, not UK). I could be wrong but I'm skeptical of the accuracy.</p>
