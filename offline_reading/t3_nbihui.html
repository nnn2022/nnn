    <strong>i am begging you my fellow human beings living in the space occupied by the swiss nation state: let us end the dictatorial reign of the federal council via emergency law powers</strong>
    <p><p>in  my recent writings i am envisioning a lifesuit what would have  nanomachines in it which work closely with bacterias and virus, with the  very basic living organisms what are responsible for our health, which  live inside of our intenstines, in our stomach, in our colons, which  live on our skins the idea here would be that a human being what does  not want to be bound to agriclture, who does not want to be bound to  wear clothes or use tools ... a human being who does not want to be  emprisoned into any form of human society structure with all its crazy  bacteriaphopic and virophobic psychosis ... or at least its  vulnerability to fall prey to certain political elements who abuse the  fear of bacteria and virus to dehumanize most everyone to a most  sadistic set of freedom depriving societal norms imposed via weaponised  state violence ... restrictions of freedom of movement, restrictions of  freedom of assembly, restrictions of ability to sell wares and services,  demanding social distance, hand sanitation, face mask wearing ... it  all crowned now in spring 2021 with this most ridiculous combination of  big governement pushing experimental unsafe vaccines needled into most  everyones arms ... as for now the vaccines seem to be voluntary, lets  hope it stays that way ...uuups ... my disturbed mind, my paranoid self  suffering now from a year of waiting for the police to come to my  appartements door demanding of me to allow a nurse  stick a plastic stick  up my nose so that i could be tested for coronavirus and then be forced  into quarantine or isolation with possible further "medicinal" abuse  following ....  </p>
<p><strong>this disturbed me who is really, honestly ... please ...  beggingly asking us fellow swiss people to end the federal councils  dictatorial reign</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>how  is it possible that we live now more than a year under the  authoritarian rule of 7 people who were only elected by some few hundred  national parlamentarians ...</p>
<p>7  people who we have only indirectly chosen decide now since more than a  year what we 8.4 million people living in switzerland would be allowed  to do, where to shop when for what wares, when where to meet indoors and  outdoors with whom in what number size of groups ... these 7 people now  since about july 2020 imposing a mask mandate to everyone who wants to  use public transport and buy some stuff in a physical shop  </p>
<p>how is it  possible that the few hundred people who got elected some years ago by  the people eligible in switzerland to vote ... the national - und  staende raete/council ... that they do not take back the emergency law powers  from the federal council ... as clearly there never was an emergency   </p>
<p>ah  yes ... they dont do it because it would bring some suspicions about  what really happened during this year now ... because the chance would  rise of being embarrassed ... the people who were elected to make laws  in switzerland choose now to leave the emergency power abusing federal council in its self-given role of dictator   </p>
<p><strong>the longer this goes on, the  more difficult it will be to get back to a sort of democratic normalcy</strong></p>
<p>of course me, i do not believe that a democracy what has splitting of  law making powers and electing political representives at its base has a  good chance of being just ... most to the contrary :  </p>
<p>i find the very  division of powers and the giving away of law making powers to  representatives most dangerous in regards to corruption and conflicts of  interests ... as can be seen at this very moment ...   </p>
<p>the ones who were  running out of their offices in march/april 2020 to stay home now for nearly a year ... the law makers elected ... are not integer enough at  this moment to demand, to decide that its enough now with the abuse of  emergency powers and that the federal council should now return to  its executive role before this whole false flag attack on democracy under the  disguise of caring for each others health happened...  </p>
<p>i somehow suspect that  there is some love for authoritarianism inside the swiss people making this horrendous political climate at this moment possible<br>
the same  admiration some people bring up for willhelm tell, the mythical  crossbow hunter who was forced by a foreign political governing agent to  shoot an apple of his sons head ... his son taken hostage basicly and  him being challenged to save his son from being harmed by the foreign  political governing agent ... gessler of habsburg  </p>
<p>the same admiration  some people bring up for the mythical swiss dedication to stand up against oppression has somehow turned opposite ... into who will harass ones fellow neighbours more to comply to the crazy abusive behaviour training  ...   </p>
<p>nowadays the whole fucking planet follows  the dicatorial examples of a one-party political system what herds the  people its taken hostage by birth, by nationality ...  </p>
<p>let us not forget  that swiss people allowed the chinese dictatorship, the communist party regime<br>
to invest 46 billion swiss francs into swiss economy by buying an agrochemical company called  syngenta   </p>
<p>the very federal council who is enjoying its near-dictatorial  emergency powers these days ... has again and again shown its likings  for mutual friendly investor protection agreements like its written in  this document</p>

<p>would  i not be the coward which i am ... i would say ...   </p>
<p><strong>shame on you federal  council ... dehumanizing your fellow people just to show your dictator  friends in china that you are able to train your fellow citizens like  young dogs, tell us when to leave our houses, how to meet with whom,  what clothes to wear etc. ( face mask being a piece of cloth yes ? )</strong>  </p>
<p>and i would say this strongly reminds me of  some other governemental abuse where the interests of local communities  get sold out against the interests of global investment capital</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/31/justin-trudeau-kinder-morgan-pipeline-china-did-he-fear-being-sued">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/31/justin-trudeau-kinder-morgan-pipeline-china-did-he-fear-being-sued</a></p>
<p>oh i am knee depp into it now ... how to get out of this mess what i have manouvred myself in</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>i call out to the federal council:</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>stop mandating us to wear masks when using  public transport or entering a shop</strong><br>
<strong>stop abusing emergency powers in  times when there is no emergency</strong><br>
<strong>stop telling people when they could meet  in what numbers</strong> </p>
<p><strong>stop coersing people into contact tracing each  other</strong></p>
<p><strong>stop showing the global investment capital handlers how well you are  able to abuse the national weapon based law powers to oppress people  into obedience</strong></p>
<p>----<br>
okay that was a bit thick and heavy ...paranoid me  allready sees itself being threatened by some police underlings ... them  following trough my worst fear after i so forthcomingly have presented them in my public writings ... provoking me into resisting medical  testing or alternativly ... sending me a private message  on social media demanding me to take down these posts where i accuse the federal council of being a dictator<br>
otherwise risk being  accused in court <br>
or even worse directly being accused by a court of  falsely accusing the federal council of being in league with global  investment circles ... <br>
mmmh...i believe there is much evidence for that  they really are <br>
and fewer indications that i would be wrong about it  </p>
<p>ah i  can not get out or can i ?  </p>
<p>where was i before i started this tirade on  the demise of swiss political climate into a dictatorship aimed to show  the most sucessfull dictatorship on the planet, the communist one-party  regime of the chinese nation state, how much the swiss authoritarians  are willing to subdue their fellow people, how far they are willing to  opress the peoples freedom to guarantee the safety of foreign global  capital investment  </p>
<p>ah yes ... i tried to establish the vision of a human  being who is not dependant onto its fellow human beings ... as most of  them will not blink with an eye, will not wait a second before selling  out their fellow neigbours for some extra money paid for their contact  tracing services, for some services rendered allowing foreign capital  interests to be rooted into local economy at the expense of the local  people freedom   </p>
<p>and no, i am not anti-asian ... i highly respect the art of tai chi movement as well as many of the wisdoms of chinese culture ... in the very same  intensity with what i am despising any sort of dictatorship and  oppression</p></p>
