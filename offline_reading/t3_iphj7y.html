    <strong>Why do you object to wearing a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>It's proven to help stop infection of COVID-19 in some way, it's mildly intrusive, there's no health/religious concerns regarding it, and it's a sign of respect for others. Genuinely asking, I truly don't understand.</p></p>

        <p>Same reason I didn't wear a mask before COVID was a thing.  I don't operate under the assumption that I'm carrying an infections disease 24/7, and I don't consider it my responsibility to go out of my way to make strangers <em>feel</em> safe.</p>
<p>I could have asymptomatically carried the flu in 2019 and passed it on to a grandma that died from it.  If it wasn't necessary for me to wear a mask then, it's not now.</p>

        <p>A big list of negatives are in the comment I linked to. </p>
<p>And no I don't think it's heartless to not feel guilty about not wearing a mask.  People that make the choice to leave their homes should accept the risk of getting sick and dying.  I'm obviously not going to start sneezing in people's faces, but beyond that there's a normal level of risk we must accept in order to live our lives.  I accept the risk of dying from COVID just like I accept the risk of dying in a car accident.  It just is.</p>

        <p>Lack of response like the travel ban early on? Do you want the president to put his boxing gloves on and get in the ring with the virus? What else do you want? If anything, take issue with blue governors. They've had the worst response and the highest numbers, in addition to wrecked economies.</p>

        <p>Last I checked the virus is not disappearing in countries that reopened.  The UK, France, and Spain are all climbing in cases again (the fact that we panic over cases and ignore deaths is a whole different issue).  Oh and their overall death rates still exceed America's.  Meanwhile Australia and Canada are freaking out and locking down over "spikes" numbering in the hundreds.  </p>
<p>We've become better at treating the disease.  The disease is beyond the point of containment in most of America even with mitigation.  All we're doing by locking down is creating second-order effects that we'll have to deal with in addition to the lockdowns.  If I have to choose between a lot of COVID deaths versus a lot of COVID deaths, suicides, people with mental health disorders, shuttered businesses, and upward transfer of wealth, and a blatant expansion of authoritarian governments, I'll choose the former.</p>

        <p>Well ... where I live (not USA), after having no local cases for 4 months, masks became mandatory in all indoor public places 2 weeks ago.  I'm at a loss for what this is supposed to accomplish.  It can't be to "reduce transmission" or to "bring cases down" because those things have already happened.  Even more concerning is:  what will be the metric now for this to be lifted?    </p>
<p>My experience doesn't line up with your comment.  Here, masks are obviously not to make COVID "start to disappear", and they seem to have become "the new normal", except for no reason.</p>

<p>You should come to my country (Switzerland), pretty much nobody even gives a fuck about the virus at this point. The only reason we wear masks in public transportation, is because the governments wants us to. And even then nobody would snitch on you or attack you, for not wearing one.</p>

        <p>I don't care about wearing masks in a store, but the mask rules have gotten ridiculous because it is silly security theater.  Just some of the dumber ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>Governor Porky in Illinois just set up a rule that customers have to pull up their masks every time they order food or interact with their waiter which is in itself silly.  I'm supposed to pull up my mask every time a server walks by.</li>
<li>Gyms requiring people to wear masks despite all the machines and equipment being socially distanced.  I don't know about you but I cannot exercise with a mask on.  It is too hard to breathe and get a decent workout.  And it makes absolutely no sense given that very few people in the gym and everyone is away from each other.</li>
<li>Disney not allowing people to carry around water in their parks and pull down their masks to drink.  Apparently, they want people to pass out from heat exhaustion and dehydration in the Florida heat.</li>
<li>Rules forcing people to wear masks outside in general.  They aren't necessary and it is ridiculous.  It's being drizzly and damp in Illinois for the past few days but the doomers think that I'm going to wear a wet mask over my nose when I am outside?</li>
<li>Rules about the "type" of mask you can wear...  If people think it is easier to breathe with a bandanna on, leave them alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rules are just ridiculous and are there to make a group of hypochondriacs feel better.  Rather than mandating it in crowded subways and stores, the doomers are insisting on people wearing masks when walking outside.  It's nonsense and hysteria and show.  If they had just insisted on public transportation and grocery stores they'd have more buy-in.  But we cannot do anything calmly and rationally.  Everything is going overboard rather than acting like adults.</p>

        <p>With the way the goal posts keep getting pushed back, it looks like they want to make this permanent. Are you okay with doing this forever? Or years? (I'm asking this respectfully, not trying to be condescending, just curious) </p>
<p>Also it's hard for a lot of us who have mental health, sensory, and trauma problems. There is no leeway. Some of us can't go back to work because we can't tolerate it for more than a short time. My area has very low cases and hardly any deaths now, and my gov keeps extending phase 3(more like 2.5) just seems like it will never end.</p>

        <p>It is NOT proven. It is maddening that people keep repeating this nonsense. When asked further, they point to some study. There are 2 problems with this. </p>
<p>1) For every study that shows that masks are effective, there is a study that shows that they are not effective. The science is far from settled on the matter. And from what I have read, the case against masks is much more compelling. </p>
<p>2) More importantly, theoretical studies, while nice and all, take a back seat to actual real world, in practice, data. We have months of data from all over the world where mask mandates have been implemented. And when you actually look at the results of those mandates, it is extremely clear that mask mandates DO NOT slow the spread of the disease. Let's look at a few examples.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong><br>
California issued a statewide mask mandate on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/18/880583357/california-gov-newsom-makes-face-masks-mandatory-amid-rising-coronavirus-cases">June 18</a>. And some places like Los Angeles County had mask mandates in effect since <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/05/l-a-county-coronavirus-update-public-health-director-says-masks-are-in-fact-mandatory-across-the-entire-county-1202935226/">May 14.</a> So you would think that cases would slow down in California, but that's not what happened. <a href="https://imgur.com/dZVhEwi">Here</a> is the daily new cases chart from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/california/">worldometers</a>. It clearly shows that mask mandates have not led to a slow in the spread of the virus. In fact, the opposite happened. As masks were mandated, cases began to rise at a more rapid rate. After the statewide mandate, cases dramatically increased for over a month until it peaked on July 25th. If masks were effective, you would expect at the least a flattening of the curve. But this did not happen. What is also interesting is that Los Angeles County accounts for nearly half of all of California's <a href="https://imgur.com/ky2V0gh">deaths</a>, and they have had a mask mandate in place since mid May. And this <a href="https://imgur.com/PNjQIHP">map</a> from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html">New York Times</a> shows that California, and the LA area are very compliant when it comes to mask wearing. Mask wearing has not been effective in California.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong><br>
The same thing happened in Florida. While there is no statewide mask mandate, most of the largest cities in the state (Miami, Tampa, Orlando) implemented mask mandates by <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/06/19/major-florida-cities-now-require-use-of-face-mask-in-public-places/">June 19th.</a> Yet after the mandates, cases continued to rise for nearly a month, finally peaking on <a href="https://imgur.com/48pabWz">July 13.</a> And in similar fashion, the curve wasn't flattened at all, on the contrary, the rate of new cases increased after mask mandates were implemented. Mask wearing has not been effective in Florida. </p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong><br>
Texas has a similar story. While a statewide mask mandate was issued on July 3rd, the largest cities (<a href="https://patch.com/texas/irving-tx/dallas-county-judge-issues-order-requiring-face-masks">Dallas</a>, <a href="https://houstonse.org/blog/harris-county-new-mask-order/">Houston</a>, <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=342433">Austin</a>, <a href="https://www.bexar.org/3234/COVID-19">San Antonio</a>) all implemented mask mandates around June 22. Yet after this mandate, cases continued to increase regardless, finally peaking on <a href="https://imgur.com/qUuLpYw">July 16</a>. Mask wearing has not been effective in Texas.</p>
<p>The same thing can be said for Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. All of these places implemented mask mandates, yet cases continued to increase regardless. And this is not just an American thing. The same thing has been observed around the world. Spain, France, Belgium, and countless other nations implemented strict mask mandates, only to have cases to continue to increase. And then you have places like Scandinavia, which didn't impose masks, yet had similar results (Sweden) or better (Denmark, Norway, Finland). </p>
<p>The data is overwhelming that mask wearing does not slow the spread of covid. Nearly every place where it has been tried has not resulted in reduced case numbers. So why should I support a policy that is not backed by science or data? Why should I be ok with governments ignoring actual data and implementing policies that have proven to not be effective, and in many cases seem to exacerbate the problem? Yes, the act of wearing a mask is not a huge deal. But the principle of allowing governments to mandate behavior that is not supported by data or science is very troubling.</p>

        <p>Because during flu season we didn't wear them why now? Why suddenly do we care about others? </p>
<p>Whenever someone says why they wear a mask its never because it protects them, its because it makes people FEEL safe, or its a sign of respect and care, or gives social outcasts the chance to hide their face so they aren't so anxious.</p>
