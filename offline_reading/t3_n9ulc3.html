    <strong>Anybody else have suspicions possible vaccine deaths in the family of with close friends? My grandma just died 5 days of taking one...</strong>
    <p><p>So guys, I am in shock, so bear with me if my english gets all types of fucked up. </p>
<p>My grandma had he jab on friday. Second dose of pfizer. She dropped dead today morning, just like on these videos and died within 3 minutes. She had some health issues, but nothing too serious. She complained about the pain in her back and was gone very quickly. At least she didnt suffer too much...</p>
<p>My parents asked the the guy if they need to do an autopsy (to determine if it has anything to do with the jab), to which he said: "no this is a clear case, probably an aortic rupture". So they didnt do it. </p>
<p>I dont know...i just see the similarity of how these people drop within minutes and they're gone that has been displayed on NNN and some other free speech places. I know about pfizer, the company, even an person who has previously worked for them told me to stay away from this product. </p>
<p>I fucking told my grandparents to at least wait with this, as its not sufficiently tested. My grandma was a chemist so she knew herself this was rushed. But they're good people, they project that goodness onto others, they probably thought this really was all about health. </p>
<p>Im fucking pissed, confused and crying my eyes out, because i didnt even get to see her in the last year or so, due to all the impossible hoops they have put in place. She even told me last year shed rather die than not see me again when i had a glimmer of hope to make it happen during the summer and asked her if shed like to see me. And now, great, I didnt see her and she died.</p></p>

        <p>I'm very sorry for your loss. If you think there's a connection between the vaccine and her death, then do whatever you can to expose that connection. Report the death, at the very least, to the VAERS portion of the CDC website.</p>
<p>Again, I'm sorry for your loss. Stay strong.</p>

        <p>&rt; If you think there's a connection between the vaccine and her death</p>
<p>If an adverse reaction (like death) follows a vaccine, you should report to VAERs regardless of whether you think the vaccine was related. </p>
<p>VAERs is a simple data collection system, not a “things definitely caused by vaccines” system. A report on VAERs is, by itself, never proof of causation; it merely shows correlation. </p>
<p>It is important to report ALL instances of adverse events shortly following a vaccine even if you suspect it is unrelated. Doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li>creates a record </li>
<li>may prompt a proper investigation, so that causality can be confirmed or ruled out </li>
<li>contributes to a large data set that enables the identification of patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If a person gets a vaccine and then has an adverse reaction of some sort, always report the correlation.</strong></p>

        <p>File a report with VAERS. Is there any way to demand an autopsy? So many people are being denied autopsies because the medical field either don't want to know if it's the vaccine or just doesn't care.</p>

        <p>She was a healthy lady with no prior issues. Obviously no one wants to believe it was the vaccine, but she had a heart attack and Pfizer is being studied in Israel now for causing inflammation around the heart, heart palpitations, murmurs and heart attacks, especially in young men.</p>

        <p>Yes I said “especially young men”. I guess I should have been clearer that they’re studying it because it’s happening in young healthy men which means you can’t just brush off the situation and say “oh they were old, they probably would have gotten that issue anyways.” Doesn’t mean that it’s not happening to older folks as well.</p>

<p>The issue is that when an older individual dies within a short period or experiences heart issues, they’re much more likely to be brushed off.</p>

        <p>Well I know plenty who had Covid, 2 elderly person had it rough, everyone else had it from asymptomatic to a flu illness without long-covid bullshit. I know 3 person that got jab. One elderly couple is all fine, 1 elderly woman who was fine &amp; didn't caught corona for a whole year, got jab, fell so ill she couldn't move out of bed for 3 days.

        <p>Yeah, she 'tested positive'. Here government doesn't tell vaccine kicking your ass means it's working or these are just expected, benign side effects. Her family was clueless and concerned and they got her tested. My country follows trend with all other countries - start vaccinating, covid cases start skyrocketing.

        <p>I’m so sorry. My grandma died of lockdown isolation in October. People stopped visiting so she stopped eating. A woman in my neighborhood who is vaccine skeptical but got it anyway for work told me her father got it and that her father’s girlfriend had an aneurysm and died right next to him a couple weeks ago. I didn’t ask if his gf had taken the vaccine or if she thought it was that, I didn’t want to be insensitive but I assume she got it.</p>

<p>She has recovered now thankfully. You’re not alone for feeling like this, honestly wanting answers for what happened to my wife is why I came here. And instead I am just left with more questions. I didn’t know if she was going to make it through the night or not when it happened.</p>
<p>Don’t let anybody gaslight you, the circumstances of your grandmas passing are extremely suspicious here. And you deserve answers. Keep doing your own research. Stay strong and hugs friend</p>

        <p>She seems fine now yes, we are both still really shook about the whole thing. Her face got really messed up when she fell and passed out just before the seizure. She had marks all over the side of her face, a cut and a black eye. It’s healing now though. When that happens to a healthy person with no pre existing conditions you KNOW something is wrong </p>

        <p>Overall she felt like she got duped.. I wish I did more to educate her about it before getting it. Because of all the “it’s totally safe” propaganda online I don’t think people know what they’re getting into and tbh I thought I was being anxious and I didn’t think something like this would happen to the person I love like the stories online </p>

        <p>I work in inpatient psych, and I’ve been keeping track of a weird trend related to symptoms after the second dose. I’ve kept a record of the manufacturer, patient ages, first vs second dose. I’ve got multiple cases from both of the manufacturers. The notable and common denominator is that the patients have no prior psych history. None.</p>

        <p>My best friend works in a hospital (not a friend of a friend, but my best friend I see all the time.) They had a 36 yr old woman in for an organ retrieval the other day, died of blood clots following the AZ vaccine. The AZ vaccine = 1 in 200,000 risk of developing blood clots.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, still pretty slim chances realistically. I'm not specifically concerned with the idea of elderly/vulnerable people being vaccinated, I mean they get flu vax for the same reason. I'm uneasy with the idea of being locked out of life though for not having it, even if you're young fit and healthy with zero symptoms of anything YOU STILL MIGHT BE A KILLER THO. Erm. Not sure on that one chief.</p>

        <p>See that’s the problem.</p>
<p>You obviously don’t want the shot. But you are letting them force you. Try to find loopholes through it, such as a medical exemption. You can claim to have symptoms of GBS, they will give you a neuro exam and you just need to fake your way through the test. They can’t tell you what you are feeling. If you say your legs are numb after a vaccine, they have to believe you! Just make sure to brush up on acting skills. You can’t let them force you, that’s the problem all along— people just going along with it.</p>

        <p>The vaccine probably causes a bunch of side effects but it sounds highly unlikely that this was one of them. 
A sudden back pain and death within three minutes sounds a lot like a ruptures aorotic aneurysm and there is no way the vaccine could have caused that.

        <p>My father was 71. He took his first Pfizer vaccine on March 14, ended up in the icu by the 19th and after a long battle and heading to recovery, had a massive heart attack April 24th with clotting in major arteries. I am not an anti vaxxer but I’m against this vaccine. Peep this document before before it gets deleted again: https://circleofmamas.com/health-news/frontline-workers-testimonials-vaers-reports/</p>

        <p>There are ample reports of elderly people dying shortly after being vaccinated - not at all surprising, as elderly people are known to die, and not necessarily related (but possibly related). </p>
<p>Of course, OP could be lying, but there is no reason to suspect that here because:</p>
<ul>
<li>elderly people die regularly of myriad causes </li>
<li>many elderly people have been reported to die shortly after vaccination (which is correlation but not necessarily causation) </li>
</ul>
<p>Fundamentally, the claim of “my grandmother died after being vaccinated” is quite plausible (let’s reiterate in case this is confusing: even if someone dies immediately after receiving a vaccine, or listening to rap music, or playing bridge, or eating shrimp, it does not mean that the vaccine/rap music/bridge game/shrimp <em>caused</em> the death). </p>
<p>What precise aspect of this do you find so implausible that you are willing to risk being incredibly cruel to someone who just lost their grandmother? </p>
<p>And a follow up question: do you think someone who goes out of their way to engage in gratuitous cruelty towards others can be considered a good person?</p>
