    <strong>once we stop electing political representives and reform regional and nation states constitutions ... tryanny will be no longer a political possibility</strong>
    <p><p>i am asking myself if the appropriate action of me would be to not use any of these public transport vehicles again after that traumatic timeframe when some governement executives decided that they would have the moral authority to abuse emergency law powers to restrict everyones breathing of free air flow by demanding everyone to mask up</p>
<p>i am seriously disturbed after this year full of shops being closed, businesses being hindered functioning, people made to fear each others proximity via social distancing no more being a choice but having been morally imposed onto us by these ... think of it ... elected governement executives ... how in the world could it have been possible that they all put us on a list like fugitives ... most eagerly taking up the advise given to national governements in march 2020 by the  so called world health organisation " find, isolate, treat and track every case " ... contact tracing ...what a horrendous dehumanizing concept have we allowed these elected governement employes to abuse us with</p>
<p>and now its the push for most everyone to get chemically damaged by some experimental dangerous vaccine ... <strong>when does the crazy end ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>i guess it will end ...</strong></p>
<p><strong>the day when we stop electing them into office</strong></p>
<p>the day when we start collecting signatures from each other to demand via the legal framework of the regional and nation states we live in ... when we demand via citizen initiatives, people intitiatives, referendum ... the very state constitutions, the very regional state constitutions and the nation state constitutions to be radically reformed .. so that no one ever will have the power to be a tyrant to its fellow citizens</p>
<p>possibly using words like:</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>the local community is its own absolute political sovereign. the village/town/city-district inherits/receives all political powers from the regional state and the nation state.</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the law what is valid on its territory, rules made with and for all permanent residents, all children, youth and adult human beings who live here and now as permanent residents invited to participate in the law making, maintaining and interpreting process, each inhabitant enjoying the very same weighted political voting power. this local law replaces all laws previously made on regional state level and  nation state level.</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities inherit/receive a fair proportional share of all material and financial wealth of both the regional state and the nation state, the size of the share proportional to the numbers of permanent residents.</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all time is able without conditions to exit/quit/leave both the regional state and the nation state.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>such a radical dissolving of all political hierarchies done via the people demanding it ...such a constitutional reform sucessfully transitioned would then allow eventually a local sovereign community to for example use the inherited material and financial wealth of the regional and nation state to buy the most precious asset a society can posess ... the ownership, no better expressed, the public stewardship over as much of the land as possible</p>
<p>asking all private farmland and forest owners if they would be willing to voluntarily sell the land towards the local community to a fair avarage market price</p>
<p>not pressuring them at all but the full assembly of all children, youth and adults of this local community which would decide in a qualified majority vote of 60 or 75 percent</p>
<p>to use the inherited wealth for this initiative to bring the land back to the community ... the full assembly of all permanent residents calling on the conscience of the private landowner</p>
<p>"could you imagine how it would be if we all who live here and now would have equal acess to farmland and forests ... so that each one of us could use a free loan given by the community, 1000 square meters of fertile farmland for every one human being living here and now, given for lifetime, rentfree, taxfree</p>
<p>we would not ask anymore taxes from each other but let everyone sustain itself, build its own house with its own hands, grow its own vegan foodstuff with ones own hands work so that we all would grow strong and independant ... never again would anyone need asking for work or for an appartement to rent, no one need to accept an other human being as boss or "landlord"</p>
<p>we are all equal before each other once we can root ourselves on some piece of land what we do not possess but also no one would want to take away from us</p>
<p>all this abuse and traumatic social alienation we experienced in 2020 ... it would have not happened would we as the people have reformed the regional states and nation states constitutions in 2019 so that the only place ever a law is made would be the full assembly of all children, youth and adult human beings living in the local community</p>
<p>none of this "divide et impera" "divide to rule" what we suffer under since the roman citizens in their sadistic hunger for domination spread out over whole europe 2000 years ago ... none of this nation state dominates the regional state what laws in what modality would be forced onto the villges/towns/cities ... none of this division of political powers needs to be</p>
<p>once we look carefully at the very root of the continued exploitation, deceipt, being taken advantage of ... what the majority of human beings suffer from the few percentage of people the very same downtrodden majority votes again and again into offices</p>
<p>as long as we give away our political vote to any representative of any symbolic colour ( red, blue, green, yellow, black etc... )  of any political party ... as long as we keep continue to give away our polical powers to others ... we will allways be at risk of being deceived, lied to, being played badly ... it all ending in us crying from sorrows and loss and them counting their money earned in them having sucessfully exploited us once again</p>
<p><strong>it will only stop once we say</strong> </p>
<p><strong>no more</strong></p>
<p><strong>enough with that representatives electing sharade</strong> </p>
<p>now its us the people who want to create, maintain and interprete the law in the circle of all human beings no matter the age no matter the place of birth ... we all who are permanent residents in this local community each one speaking and voting for itself, each one representing itself in the full assembly of all inhabitants of this local sovereign community</p></p>
