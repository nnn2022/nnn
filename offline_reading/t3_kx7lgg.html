        <p>I posted this at /r/conspiracy months ago, and all the people there just discredited it because "there wasn't a novel virus back then". No amount of science or data or research is ever good enough for these people, they <strong>want</strong> to be afraid and at the mercy of the government.</p>

        <p>a) Cloth masks were never intended to replace or work as well as medical masks. Health officials wanted medical masks to be reserved for health workers simply because there weren't enough medical masks to go around.</p>
<p>b)  People don't know how to keep cloth masks clean: "The authors speculate that the cloth masks' <strong>moisture retention</strong>, their <strong>reuse</strong> and poor filtration may explain the increased risk of infection." How long do you keep a hand towel hanging on the oven before you put it in the laundry?</p>
<p>c) Cloth masks were never intended to keep the wearer from getting sick. Their entire purpose is to help keep the wearer from getting other people sick by stopping the wearer's virus-laden sneeze/spit droplets from getting out.</p>

        <p>Yeah, well if someone starts without the virus, he's not contagious, then gets infected due to face diaper wearing, then is a lot more contagious then if he had never worn a face diaper.  So when you introduce a device that increases receptive transmission by ALOT and decreases external transmission by a little, you are overall INCREASING THE SPREAD WITH FACE DIAPERS.</p>

        <p>Blame the people that go out without a mask at all. Whether actually sick or asymptomatic, those are the contagious people that are getting people who wear cloth masks sick. The mask doesn't cause people to get sick. Sick people cause people to get sick.</p>

        <p>It is absurd to deny that face diapers collect and breed bacteria, collect dead cells, and collect virus particles. It is not common knowledge, but bacteria and dead cells are express pods for viruses. Add that to the fact you are breathing in this pathogen soup over and over. Face diapers are not only INCREASING the spread of viruses, they are MULTIPLYING the spread of bacteria. When they say someone died of complications of covid, they usually mean BACTERIAL pneumonia. What better source of BACTERIA than a face diaper. After face diaper mandates were implemented, cases SKYROCKETED, but through some twisted lawyer/politician logic, that was an excuse for more mandates. A face diaper is mandated self harm.</p>

        <p>a) Cloth masks were never designed to protect anyone, period.  They have never been vetted for medical use, aren't subject to a regulatory body that specifies particle sizes, fit, tests, etc.  They're fashion statements, nothing more.  Every study prior to this year has shown even medical masks don't impact aerosol spread in a population, arbitrarily less effective cloth does nothing positive at all.</p>
<p>b) The problem is that depending on mask design, moisture retention can compromise the mask in a VERY short period of time.  Far from washing them every day, you would need to bring several with you to work, on a flight, whatever.</p>
<p>c) There's no evidence that masks of any common design restrict coughs/sneezes at all (the straps aren't tight enough to contain the pressure).  Most masks aren't of a tight enough weave or fit to prevent aerosols from flowing right through AND around (see mayo clinic video demonstration) from normal breathing.  Actual N95 masks are designed to protect the wearer, not the sick.  The only masks actually designed to protect someone other than the wearer are surgical masks which are only designed for droplets, not aerosols.  This "my mask protects you" argument was bunk from the start.</p>

        <p>a) A-yup, that's correct. N95 masks are the only masks rated to deal with fine particulates. Medical, or more commonly "surgical", masks, are about as useless as cloth masks.</p>
<p>b) The "reuse" portion is the biggest problem. You're not supposed to re-use a mask until it's been cleaned and cleaned good. Wear it once to the store, and as soon as you're out you drop it in the laundry. The proper way is to wear a new, clean mask every time you would take off the current mask, or replace the mask after max 1 hour of continual use.</p>
<p>c) Sneezing and coughing produces much more droplets than aerosols, and droplets also contain far far more of the virus than aerosols. The reason to change your mask so often is because anything that gets on the outside of your mask can dig through to the other side, but it's not an instant process. Even an N95 mask isn't 100% perfect, but the point is to reduce as much as possible. Eliminating just the droplet transmissions will still do far more to control transmission than not wearing anything at all.</p>

        <p>C) will it? There seems to be great disagreement here. Generally it seems aerosols are the primary transmission vector. Droplets may have more viruses, but if they land on the floor a few feet away it's irrelevant. Even projected upward out the top of the mask they simply csny travel but so far.</p>
<p>Every study prior to 2020, and several since, has shown mask usage among the general population doesn't slow the spread of colds. Whether from poor masks, poor habits, poorly fitted, or just unsuited to the task is uncertain, but even in areas with high mask compliance, like california, the cold season is doing what cold seasons do. In the UK, the seasonal rhinovirus trend remains completely normal despite all the varying intervention efforts!</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that the issue is with the quality of cloth masks. If you can get an N95 mask, then do it.</p>
<p>This study isn't advocating going maskless. It's advocating that people should be <strong>using better masks</strong>.</p>

        <p>Sure.</p>
<p>I'm suggesting that masking the public is ineffective. Wearing an n95 correctly isn't something people can generally do either. Even being careful, using a clean mask every time, being clean shaven, and not moving your head or mouth at all, you're going to be getting enough blow by to drastically limit the effectiveness.</p>
<p>I've done periodic fit tests as part of my work, the devices show you exactly how much is making it around the mask.</p>
<p>Even with a really good mask where blowby can mean literal and immediate death, like an scba mask in a fire, getting a quality seal takes practice, fit tests, shaving, and checking your seal before actually entering an IDLH environment.</p>
<p>It turns out pretty much any aspect of real aseptic technique is hard, and people aren't up to the challenge.</p>
