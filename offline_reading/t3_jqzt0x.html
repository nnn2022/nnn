    <strong>I'm probably gonna kill myself because of the "new normal".</strong>
    <p><p>I'm fucking done. I can't do this anymore. The moment Biden gets inaugurated I'm gonna fucking do it. I can't live in a world where masks are made mandatory and this pandemic shit is gonna last forever. I've tried talking to people about the way I feel, but all they do is tell me I should feel bad about caring about myself more than others and that I'm a crazy conspiracy theorist republican nazi. I'm not even a republican, I'm just a person who is sick of this shit to the point where I dread waking up in the morning. I can't think about anything other than the pandemic and how everyone is buying into this "New Normal" bullshit. I'm tired of everyone calling me selfish for not wanting to change every aspect of my life and destroy everything that once made me happy in the name of the pandemic. I have officially lost all hope.</p></p>

        <p>I'd say hold on for a while longer. There's the possibility that they will stop the bullshit now so that the media can say that "Biden defeated covid". And then everything will be back to normal, since the virus would no longer be useful.</p>

        <p>And you would be okay with everyone continuing to be programmed by this false narrative so that the next time another 0.15% IFR virus comes along, they can do this disgusting nightmare all over again? God forbid the next virus is 0.5%, they'll be making concentration camps for that. The most important thing now is not that this ends so Dems can make themselves look good, and make Trump look bad. The most important thing now is the idiotic public be reprogrammed so they go back to 2019 mode, where this psychotic response is not seen as a completely normal and scientific and logical reaction to a flu-like virus.</p>

        <p>And I would be ok with it, yes. Because they won. They proved they can get away with this. They proved they can do this whenever they want. They proved their point and all we can do is beg them to stop. </p>
<p>Reprogram everyone? How? When? With what time? It's all fucked anyway. I'd rather have this end, normies think Trump bad (which they were going to do regardless) and we finally go back to our lives.</p>

        <p>You should absolutely not be okay with it... because they will just commit more tyranny. Is this the future we want for our children? Never give in to these abusive psychopaths.

        <p>2 possibilities.</p>
<p>Virus goes away because they just wanted trump out and used the virus to do it</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>Trump and biden are actually on the same team. Trump will win his contestation in court and the left will go crazy and a civil war will happen in usa leading to the great reset being able to happen.They had to do all this as a way to get the guns away from citizens to implement the great reset in the last  country with some possible resistance</p>
<p>I really hope its number one but my gut feeling thinks this whole thing is way more than just getting trump out</p>

<p>Politically, Biden will do very little.  Only 8 votes separate the GOP from a majority in the House.  Moderate Democrats know which way the wind blew in this election:  Trump is unpopular, but so is the far left.  Plus, the GOP will have 50 votes minimum in the Senate.  Likely 52.</p>
<p>Biden, assuming he wins, will be a placeholder president for 4 years.  He's the rest after a very manic 4 years of Trump.  The 2022 mid terms will deliver a GOP House leading into the 2024 general election.  Biden is not going to seek reelection at 82.</p>
<p>If Biden ends up winning, we get the vaccine out, normalcy returns, and we get a 4 year breather.  Count on it.</p>

        <p>I agree w you.  I think this may be good thing.  The Biden win is a stop gap and it gives the GOP time to reorganize and cement  a really good candidate that could represent the working people, Hispanics, blacks and small businesses while the Dems move further left and entrench themselves in tech companies and academia</p>

<p>These leaders are gonna make it mandatory there is no doubt in my mind about that, and those leaders are the reason suicide has increased, buisness and lives have been ruined, having hurt the education of everyone that cannot afford private school, have seriously hurt the economy, have led to child marriages increasing again worldwide.

        <p>This virus is looking more and more to be nothing more than a ploy to steal the election. At first I thought it was just to make Trump look bad and crash the economy. I think that was just the bonus. The real motive was to push mail-in ballots so they could keep pulling them out of thin air until they had enough to defeat Trump. Thankfully it looks like their scheme isn’t going to work in the end.</p>

        <p>I think this is likely but I’m starting to be fearful that this is bigger than even the president, I think they’ve seen how easily people will not only comply but completely shun anyone who doesn’t. It’s possible the elites that are orchestrating this will just continue to push this and make it permanent.</p>

        <p>Why is Biden surrounding himself with the most psychotic quack shills then? I don't think Dems even understand how much damage this obsession with covid is doing. They seem like they think they can do eternal lockdowns and so gleefully destroy their economies. It's like they and most of the West has a kill switch...they just activated self-destruct as soon as China said the word.</p>

        <p>Let them self destruct! There is no common enemy anymore since trump is out so let them fight with themselves which is exactly what is happening.  AOC’s brand of democracy is extremely unpopular in “the rest of America” and the moderates are losing votes to republican candidates who are seeing that they can make the GOP into an actual party that supports economic growth AND workers’ rights through tax cuts, incentives for small businesses, better trade deals and possibly an actual functioning healthcare market.</p>

        <p>It isn't just the USA and Biden, brother. This problem is everywhere.</p>
<p>You need to find people in your life that aren't pro-covid. I know it is hard and there extremely small amounts of us, but if you can find somebody who is it is extremely rewarding.</p>
<p>My mom is anti-covid and one my my co-workers is anti-covid. I also know someone who doesn't even think it's real. (he has said that from the very start) That's it.</p>
<p>Out of 70 employees at my work there is one who isn't a doomer other than myself. Fortunately, we have formed a lunch table and other people are starting to enter the conversation and we are openly shit talking masks (we work at a school!!) so things are moving forward a little bit. We are working on converting people, but it is difficult.</p>
<p>If you know of ANYONE on the fence, find a really good video on Youtube from Ivor Cummins and show them. He is who changed my mind. (mind you I was skeptical when I realized that 'flatten the curve so the hospitals don't get overwhelmed' and the hospitals were all empty).</p>
<p>Even if are are stuck on your own you have us.</p>
<p>We have mostly lost hope too. We are just choosing the moral high ground.</p>

        <p>I realized today I'm not hearing much about moving in the opposite direction - very few people who are pro mask and pro lockdown seem willing to move to places that are stricter, despite constantly complaining about local compliance. New Yorkers and Californians are leaving in droves but Austinites and Floridians are staying put. ¿Por que?</p>

        <p>Because that's their mindset. Not: I will move if I don't like the laws, but: Force everyone where I am to do what makes me feel safe. Typical leftist mentality and can be applied to anything. They want to control ppl, not take responsibility for their own lives.</p>

        <p>You’ll still be called a Nazi even if you’re black, what matters isn’t merely appearance but whether or not you bow before them.

        <p>We should deliberately crater the Biden economy. No Amazon, no Facebook, no Google, no vacation flights (good luck EVER getting rid of face diapers on airlines), no NOTHING for the mega-corporations. Shop independent business only, for the next four years, no matter what it takes to make that happen. These bastards need to regret what they did, in the wallet. </p>
<p>Unfortunately we're likely stuck with cable companies for internet access, but they've made new TV such woke garbage that I'm considering going entirely internet-only anyway. The only things I can even stand to watch anymore are Dateline murder porn, game shows, and the BBC's Star Trek TNG &amp; DS9 reruns (from when the left actually had brains).</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. Everyone in LA was like it is what it is you have to be okay with it. They wouldn’t get upset about masks or locks downs. But I wasn’t getting upset enough about politics. One friend screamed in May “get angry” I was tired and depressed and felt unheard so I couldn’t be what my friends wanted me to be. I was scared everytime I left the apartment I was killing people having covid and not knowing it. I would cry all the time. People say take it serious but for me that felt like I was a murder. I touched my face outside once and knew an electrician was coming in a week. After touching my face I came home and sobbed for hours. I have gone mad. I tell people in LA this is my reality and to stop denying it. A month a half ago I finally started talking about my suicide plan. I had been reading more and more things saying this could go on for two to three more years. I told my loved to prepare and asked them how to make it easier for them. A lot of them got angry but I felt it was practical but they didn’t. Anywho my best friend and my mom told me to come back home for two weeks. They live in Dallas. Now in being at home I go out way more even with living with my mom. Staying at home was pointless. I barely left my apartment for 8 months. I didn’t know how to feel. They only thing I knew was that I was worried for others but not myself. The media could never get me to be scared of the virus for myself. Here are some things that have improved. I feel safer having my mom go out in a city that has been open so long. Even for older people this has been too long to stay at home. I am grateful people have been out and about the last few months so now when my mom can’t stand staying in for one more second I feel safer. LA feels more dangerous. This amount of time isn’t sustainable for any age. I am grateful for Texas having had been open so long. I have stayed for over a month. I have to back to my home and kitty and my partner who does jack shit and calls me alt right for being on this site. But this trip has saved my life, at least for a little awhile. I go out and masks suck but when you go out and about you start realizing how silly some of these rules are. Before I was a little more pro mask. I didn’t judge anyone not wearing them (I had a friend that filmed people not wearing a mask and screamed at them, when I saw it on insta gram I felt ill and almost puked. She now thinks she is being safe and socially distancing while doing essential photo shoots that she isn’t even being paid for ugh) and was I skeptical of masks before but I didn’t fully see them as bad. Coming to Dallas made it obvious. I still wear mine when around others that are strangers. But I go on walks without one on mostly, hour long walks outdoors, breathing fresh air! My friend gets away with a mesh mask when we shop. All over the stores there are noses out and some people just take them off after they enter. People are tired. In LA for some time there has been illegal house clubs, I didn’t go I was a “good citizen saving lives and while wanting to kill myself” I take 20-30 hours of zoom acting and movement classes every weeks I haven’t had a break:/ and it has been politically charged everyday. I have been miserable but even though I am still in these classes in Dallas I feel so much better! Even in Cali people can’t cope. In Los Angeles people were so scared of the virus and they still kept saying everyone has to stay at home but protests are needed and more important than the pandemic.I still get lost somewhat in that logic. But the logic of trump killing everyone and being so scared to have things open up but still celebrating in streets is beyond me. There is no need for that except that humanity needs to feel connected. But my need for connection could be met with a dinner with my best friend that has helped me when suicidal and yours could be a club or celebrating in the streets with your political party. I won’t feel bad for mine if they don’t for theirs. Everything is slightly shifting my friend. Slowly but just like in the beginning when thing start moving they really get going. For instance I laughed at the fear people had of the virus because I don’t fear stuff like that but when they started mentioned harming others I went into full lockdown mode. I shifted so fast and my friends did too, albeit they had more fear for getting the virus themselves. I hope you find some hope that allows you to last till this is over. I hope I am right that it can’t continue past 3 months. In some places it has faded almost fully. My mom’s building is filled with older people, who were paranoid about this in the beginning. Now all of these 60-90 year olds are getting out and getting food and their nails done. Hell the lady on my mom’s floor that is 103 and is hanging out with the other lady on our floor weekly and having dinners together. Sending you hope and understanding your pain as much as I can. I am sorry I sorry for any part I may have played in this reality existing.</p>

        <p>I live right in the middle of LA and it's completely surreal to me that 8 months later, so much is still shut down here. I'm fairly certain it's the only place in the U.S. with so much still shut down, right? And no one seems to be bothered by it or saying anything. Everyone still walks around outside by themselves wearing a mask. This fucking city is like trapped in March/April. It's stunning. Newsom and Garcetti can GET FUCKED.</p>

        <p>Don't lose hope brother. I am on your side, I am done too however something bigger is at play here than just mask and vaccine mandates, the future of our free world. Some of us are fighting for a better future and we need everyone! </p>
<p>Don't kill yourself, not only is it cowardice its only helping the globalists agenda. </p>
<p>I've been there I've tried killing myself 3 times, you get to a point where you either commit (everyone who has tried killing themselves have regretted it the second they let go, thankfully they survived) or you move past it. </p>
<p>This fight is temporary friend but forever is a long time. </p>
<p>I don think you're crazy at all I see through the lies too but please man, the reason i'm fighting this totalitarian globalist agenda is because I genuinely love and care about you and every other innocent person. I couldn't handle your death. You mean so much to me and others in your life. You matter and you're bigger than this temporary problem.</p>

        <p>I felt the same way you did. Luckily I did not do it and am very glad I did not commit suicide. Even Fauci says that it would take a lot to convince him that we need another national lockdown. And we all know that Fauci will be one of the main people Biden will be listening to on his panel. Fauci says this...</p>
<p>"Dr. Jon LaPook: How bad would things have to get for you to advocate a national lockdown?</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci: They'd have to get really, really bad. First of all, the country is fatigued with restrictions. So we wanna use public health measures not to get in the way of opening the economy, but to being a safe gateway to opening the economy. So instead of having an opposition, open up the economy, get jobs back, or shut down. No. Put "shut down" away and say, "We're gonna use public health measures to help us safely get to where we wanna go.""</p>
<p>So yeah, it's highly doubtful we will have another lockdown. Also, a lot of this COVID nonsense was beefed up to make Trump look like shit. Now that he lost the election, I'm willing to bet that the focus on COVID deaths will be lost dramatically. </p>
<p>Stay strong! Don't give up hope!</p>

        <p>Please once the vaccine is distributed they will ease the restrictions. Also hopefully Trump manage to stay in office, you never know. They will win if you give up. All they want is to create as much misery as possible to gain control. They are sick af but I have hope! This situation is UNACCAPTABLE what they actually are doing is illegal and a crime against humanity but people start to wake up now. Hold on!</p>

        <p>Hey there, I've been in your shoes before and wrestled with depression and suicide at the same age too. It's not worth thinking all is lost. This too shall pass. You are not alone in your line of thinking. I am neither Republican nor Democrat, and I get treated the same way as you.</p>
<p>The key to positive mental health is to accept your line of thinking will not line up with your friends, and that's ok! Now I would question if these people are your real friends, because real friends don't attack and shame your line of thinking. Real friends can disagree with you, but they will respect your stance and not treat you like a monster or call you names.</p>
<p>Now, Biden cannot do squat. He can use an executive order to mandate masks nationally, but these can be overruled at the State levels. It largely depends on your representatives' political alignment. I hate the masks and lockdowns as much as everyone else on this sub, but don't kill yourself over it. Don't hide your depression from your parents, this is serious and the first step to healing is recognizing you're depressed and step 2 is asking for help.</p>
<p>Find some positive hobbies like playing an instrument or playing video games. Find your "happy place". For me, it's working out at the gym and playing video games.</p>
<p>You can resist the order and still be happy. The key to winning mental warfare is not letting the other side's beratement get to you. Take a stance and stick to it; make the other side begin to question themselves and their beliefs. When they try to explain it to you they will begin to find out their errors in thinking.</p>
<p>The ignorant are going to be ignorant. Think about it. These people have created a mental safety net and are as equally depressed. It's a coping mechanism of rationalizing the actions of their leaders they trusted so dearly. They're going to protect it at all costs regardless of the destruction they cause. They have to figure it out on their own. Eventually everyone will see through the bullshit and push back.</p>
<p>TL; DR: stay strong; talk to your parents and don't suppress your emotions. You need to accept them and process them and find a happy way out</p>

        <p>Upvoted for visibility. I'm sorry, it is very understandable why you feel like there's no escape, especially being a minor. Otherwise I would say try to move to a different place... that's my personal plan at least. I don't know what to tell you, other than to do your best to find people who are of a like mind. It's distressing, I know, when almost everyone around you has gone crazy, but even if you can only make one friend who sees things the way you do, I think that will do you a lot of good. Good luck.</p>

        <p>I'm someone who studies the occult a lot and all the mysticism stuff.  As far as I've learned, offing yourself in any way is not a good idea.  It sucks big-time.  Along with having to watch all the scenes play over again, you have to experience every moment when you should have been there, but are not.  Every time Someone needed you and you would have been there, but are not.</p>
<p>Sucks big-time.  Then you have to come back as a baby again and try to push through similar circustances again.  Hopefully you could be there for those people that will need you at critical times in your life.  The kind that you dream about before you see them.  Those moments where you feel like you earn your life.  They certainly come.  Often when you don't feel 100% ready.</p>
<p>Taking a break from the news helps.  Seeing pure greenery like a forest or garden with a couple friends, a dog, or yourself.  It is really calming.  Things just wash right off.  One last thing is a magic trick I learned  from some very long and dense books.  Laughing in the sun.  It can remove the worst of worries if you're willing to do it.  Literally Magick.</p>

        <p>There might be a vaccine and return to normal soon judging from some of the pro-lockdown subs I also read.</p>
<p>So while it's shitty, hold on longer man. It'll likely be normal again soon. Fight for yourself and don't let them take it all from you.</p>

<p>Also, before you give up, try something very constructive, like splurge on a vacation. Or protest like mad. If you're going to do the deed, then try to convince a few souls well before of the harm of these things. What have you got to lose? Don't answer that.</p>

        <p>Please don't do that. Especially not over mask mandates. Maybe mass testing, contact tracing, supervised quarantines, mandatory vaccination....but not masks. Don't get me wrong, I'm anti-mask. Or at least pro-choice. But things could be worse, and I don't think we should give our naysayers the satisfaction of our death. Just wait and see for now. Remember, you can always choose death at a later date. You can't choose to come back to life.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I don't see a point in living either. I voted for Biden because I could never vote for Trump but I knew it would come with more stupid lockdowns and media paranoia over a head cold. Corona isn't going away, our lives however, are. Ticking down day by miserable, quarantined, sanitized, joyless day. Everything that made life even somewhat bearable for my bipolar ass is gone, and I don't know when or if I'll ever have it back.</p>

        <p>Hold off.  The first few months of Biden's administration are probably when the insanity's going to peak.  Then it'll die down.  The main thing keeping the world from going back to normal isn't going to be government pressure, but social pressure- so pull back.  As strange as this sounds, isolation doesn't suck so much when you're alone.  Take what you do have and back away from the rest.  Find your local forest preserve and go for long walks there.  Head over to Librivox and listen to readings of the great works of literature (free and legal).  If you don't have it in you to help right the ship, you can at least step away and give the world the chance to do it itself.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We've already lost a lot of good people, and we're going to lose more before all this is over.  Do you really want to be one of them?  Not to sound cold, but if you choose to live through today, you can always choose to die tomorrow- but not the other way around.</p>

        <p>What has happened to you is that you've woken up and smelt the *actual* coffee. There is a game called "We Happy Few" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Happy_Few">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Happy_Few</a> In it the guy refuses to take the "medication" any more and discovers just how sh*t everything really is. Seems to me some people are now finally refusing to buy the fairy tale lies. Sad to say that once you've woken up, you can't go back. And only a few do wake up, so it will be "uncrowded". I would say that you might like to do some research on NDEs (near death experiences) and make up your own mind about your course of action. There are books from doctors &amp; other qualified people about this. I think the "keep your chin up and smile" advice is just SO Pollyanna. Yes, things are going to hell and we NEED to talk about the truth, not some fairy story about "living happily ever after" (especially about when they "cure" their new god "scary virus"). There will always be a new god they will find to worship to keep the idiocy going. My (non-judgemental) respects and understanding to you. My personal position is that I will keep ALL options on the table and act (in a non rash manner) when I need to from a position of informed knowledge.</p>

        <p>My life is identical pre-covid as it is now, so isolation is the norm for me. The great reset is underway regardless of anything, so meanwhile I won't be wearing any mask at least. Literally 100% of people are wearing it in stores except me, yet no one says a thing. I dont expect to live past another 10 years tbh, literally pointless.</p>

        <p>True rebellion lies in not giving them precisely what they want. You must find your silver linings.</p>
<p>About a decade or so I intimately entertained offing myself one night. I did not because even then I would not let them win. Though the stakes are higher you must defer to your defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>Now it's 2020 and everything sucks but it's different. I have my children at home with me all day. And while that is hectic quite often I know that I will look back and remember that I would take my wireless mouse over to the couch to keep my remote connection from dropping and take daily naps with my son while also being able to oversee my daughter's virtual learning and fill in the parts (or correct them) that do not jive. (For example: Her social studies exercise pre-election was to choose Trump or Biden. I told her she would not be answering that question, take a zero, because she could vote for whoever she wanted.)</p>
<p>Stick around for the good. It's sometimes hard to see. You will.</p>

        <p>Hang in there dude! I am heading down the same road that you are, but it is not one to continue on. Waiting it out and watching the covid restriction cheerleaders fail will be incredibly cathartic. Also, I may not know you, but as a Catholic I can say with certainty that your life is incredibly valuable not only to our society but in the eyes of God as well.</p>

        <p>Step away from the computer, the smartphone, the news, and mind-altering substances. This has been a very stressful time for people, and that alone is enough to put some people to the edge. Throw in the extra isolation and pain you feel for understanding why it is happening, yet being unable to do anything about it, and it's understandable how you got to the point you are at now.</p>
<p>Think about the positive effect you could have on the world by staying. It is better than the lack of effect you would have by not being here. I don't want to guilt you into staying alive, because there has to be some personal motivation for you to want to continue (live for your own personal happiness, then find ways to contribute to society).</p>

        <p>Please don't. At least hold out and watch the show. I believe this may be extra hard for people with adhd, etc (not saying you are or aren't) because of time blindness, inability or difficulty planning for the future, object permanance  differences, rejection sensitivity dysphoria, etc. I already have a hard time leaving the house and now I feel like when I have to go somewhere to buy something in person (of course masked) I have the feeling like I'm in the way and no one wants me there. It is really hard to make any human connections when you can't understand them with facial expressions or words. Going shopping (even just picking up a prescription or something) used to lift my mood and make me feel part of the community but now it reminds me of how that community spirit is missing in so many shared places. I've lost touch with a lot of acquaintances like other parents from school but I have stronger relationships with my neighbors. There are people that will not stand for staying masked because it's inhumane and is against human instinct. When people start winning virtue signaling points for something else the masks will be abandoned and thrown in the landfills, parks, beaches, etc and forgotten about. Genuine life and spirit always makes a way. Keep your head up and don't listen to the liars on tv or the clueless idiots on social media :)</p>

        <p>Before you kill yourself, take one of the most notorious protagonists of this shitshow with you, please. Plan it thoroughly, so you succeed.</p>
<p>Maybe the preparations for this might be so interesting that they actually distract you from wanting to kill yourself.</p>
<p>Active resistance and counterterrorism for what the government did to us can be a fountain of youth and life. Sabotage is satisfying. Direct your destructive energy to those causing your distress, not at yourself.</p>
<p>And maybe in the end we succeed, and you have not killed anyone, not even yourself, because it wasn't necessary. </p>
<p>I don't advocate terrorism, but I do recommend taking the power back. What makes people want to kill themselves is helplessness and hopelessness. It's the perceived lack of self-efficacy. You matter. Don't give up. There's a war, and we will win.</p>
