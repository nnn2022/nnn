    <strong>Why is this sub eating itself?</strong>
    <p><p>The last few days I’ve been getting a lot of guff...for agreeing with posts?  But apparently not enough?  </p>
<p>Is it trolls?  I do what I can when I can.  I’ve got <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QWYTefs">my car</a> chalked up.  I don’t require my kids to wear masks.  I don’t ever wear them outside.  But yea I need groceries so I put one on when I’m dragging my kids in to get baby formula.</p>
<p>BuT YOu’rE COmpLyInG!!!!  </p>
<p>I don’t care what businesses require.  If Giant says I have to wear a fake mustache to shop there sure I want some cheese give me the pencil ‘stache please.  </p>
<p>Seriously stop shitting on people who agree with you.  If this is how you’d treat a comrade you’ll never win anyone else over.</p></p>

<p>It’s weird tho because they post seemingly...sub worthy things...then are unreasonably argumentative.  I’ve never seen trolls bait that hard I guess.</p>

        <p>You are arguing with a literal troll who comes here to tell us we are dumb. That's OK, allow it, these people are everywhere in the real world too. Try to not let these people get to you because it's even harder not to bite when it happens in real life. </p>
<p>As for the people who you think are trolling you for not doing enough; people are passionate, that's a good thing, we need to get more passionate if I'm honest with you. I hope they aren't being rude and just do what you can manage. </p>
<p>We're all getting ostracised, it's par for the course of having common sense and human decency. If we push hard enough you never know, the rest of them might catch up.</p>

        <p>I'm just fed up of people saying "how long can this go on for?" whilst also complying with the rules. </p>
<p>I'm not a troll or trying to spread disunity. There is no unity. Just a bunch of people complaining and doing nothing. </p>
<p>I would also probably act very differently if I had dependants so just do what you can manage but some of us take this extremely seriously and it's hard not to get annoyed. </p>
<p>This sub isn't full of unique minds. A lot of people agree with me to my face when I say we should ignore the rules as they are not in our interest. Yet I'm the only one out there actually doing it the majority of the time. Occasionally I'll see one other.  </p>
<p>Good for you doing what you can but we need to get serious if there is ever to be a way out of this.</p>

        <p>Personally, I think if everyone comes out swinging like <em>punch a nazi in the face</em> style no one will take us seriously.  Currently they think we’re all over here wearing tinfoil hats and that attitude really cements it.  People aren’t won over by in-their-face arguments.  We need to start conversation.  I put this on my van so everyone knows where I stand.  I’m happy to talk about it.  Had a friend lamenting that her only son couldn’t come home for Thanksgiving and I reminded her that the lockdowns are unconstitutional.  </p>
<p>But hey if you like the brash in your face style go on wit’ your bad self.  I haven’t told anyone in this sub they aren’t doing enough. Simply being on this sub is a good start.  But don’t tell me I’m not doing anything.  I’m risking getting ostracized by the community I live in, my kids go to school in and my husband works in.</p>

        <p>Eh I think people can change their mind.  Husband is in military and I’m a microbiologist and we watched this develop like a slow motion train wreck.  As soon as China shut down we both said “fuck this is gonna be realllll bad” and stocked up and urged families to do the same (early to mid Feb).  </p>
<p>Covid isn’t the devil we thought it was.  Initially it looked like a second more contagious SARS 1 and that was fucking terrifying. We now know way different and for my family we’ve done a 180 in our tune and attitude towards it.</p>
<p>NOW that all being said...I firmly believe you are right that this is the beginning of the end.  My personal tinfoil thoughts is that all of this was engineered (somewhat the disease but more so the reaction to it) by China to incite fear and division.  It has either been jointly with CCP or just taken advantage of by a certain political party that wants to push a new socialist type economy on the US (China has a hand because they want the Yen to be the world’s currency not the dollar and of course the blue want political power)...  perhaps they even want people like us to rebel, and with guns, so they have an excuse to squash the insurrection and take away even more rights (and label the Republican Party as a traitorous hate group).  </p>
<p>Whew that’s a lot of tinfoil thoughts.  They scare me tho.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure where you got the impression I was in everyone's face punch a nazi style? I fully agree with you on that. I just refuse to comply to any rules whatsoever. </p>
<p>Like I also said, good for you for doing what you can. It's interesting, I had a similar heated conversation with my brother who pretty much agrees with me on everything to do with this but he got pretty defensive when I started talking about silly people complying even though they know the truth (he has kids and wife).</p>
<p>I don't want to write a load more, which I have a tendancy of doing. Basically, I didn't want him to feel like I'm shaming him but I also have to say what is true: This won't change while we are all still complying.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know what I'd do if I was in his situation. On one hand I want my kids to live in reality and be aware of what is going on. On the other hand, childhood is an incredibly difficult time and you are trying to find your place and figuring out how to fit in. How can one balance the two? It's difficult. </p>
<p>My sister has managed after a lot of hard work to get an exception for her daughter to not wear a mask in school. I just worry how that affects her social life. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what sort of trolling you've been dealing with but I'd save your energy for the actual tyranny enforcers out there. A little disagreement in a healthy community is OK. </p>
<p>You are welcome to come here and complain about how having to wear a mask is frustrating and I'm allowed to remind you that this will continue until we all stop complying. Sooner or later we will all have to draw a line or give up the fight. I hope we choose the former.</p>

        <p>Listen dawg, it’s a tactic called entryism. People come into a group, then sow disunity. </p>
<p>Some of them are the conspiracy theory nuts posting ridiculous shot to make the sub look dumb.  Others are just varying degrees of disagreement. Even more insidious are the purity testers making no true Scotsman claims.  It happens on Reddit all the time because of the number of pussies who can’t handle disagreement.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  I know there are places you can do that (I visited family in NC and yea you could totally get away with it).  But where I am is CRAZY blue and no way I could-plus I’ve got three tiny children with me I don’t need them to see their mom thrown in jail over a mask.  If their schools or playgrounds shut down then yea we’ll still go outside and consequences can be accordingly.  Bringing them out mask free is enough (plus you don’t really see many kids out around here).  I wear a gaiter that has holes in it anyways it doesn’t do shit except let me into stores :/</p>

        <p>You DON'T need to wear a mask to go shopping, though. Certainly not in any of the stores I go to, and I live in Maskachusetts which has a Mask Mandate. That the signs on stores say "masks are required," means nothing -- it's just a Jedi mind trick to make you obey without even trying to resist. If you actually just go inside without a mask, however, most employees won't even question you about it. If they do, and you simply smile and explain that you're exempt, then they almost ALWAYS walk away at that point. I have yet to be kicked out of a store.</p>
<p>The problem with making exceptions for complying with private businesses is that private businesses aren't really private businesses. We don't HAVE a free market in any meaningful sense; we live in a fascist system where corporations carry out the will of the state, and there's a revolving door between them. Who do you think is going to enforce mandatory vaccines, for example, if it comes to that? Probably not governments. It will be businesses simply denying people access to goods, services, and employment unless they "consent" (against their will) to jumping through the arbitrary hoops. Just like now, for example, if you wanna get a job at many places, you have to take a piss test to prove you're not a weed user, even if weed is "legal" in your area! Just because it's the "marketplace" making such rules doesn't make them any less ridiculous and invasive. And if we continue to comply with these New Abnormal rules, then they will simply be added to the laundry list of arbitrary rules we have to follow for the "privilege" of living in a soul-sucking, dystopian society.</p>
<p>I understand we have to pick our battles, and it's easier for some to resist than others, but at a certain point we have to draw a line in the sand and exercise zero tolerance, because it would literally be better to die with honour than live as a slave. "Live free or die" isn't just some macho slogan, it's some real fucking shit. If we don't even have the most basic freedom to risk getting a cold by showing our naked smiles in public, then what is the fucking point of living? The meaning of life cannot be determined by Science, Politics, or Free enterprise; we can only determine that ourselves, and if we give up that then we've lost.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the problem is if the government says you have to fist yourself because you can boycott a business. But the government will enforce it everywhere in every business. Our sub is under attack, no kidding. So many similarly minded subs such as r/nomask and others have been purged. It all correlated with an influx of trolls sowing division. They pretend they’re with us but you can usually tell through their karma and their account creation date. I hope our sub doesn’t get purged but it almost seems inevitable.

<p>I follow the rules as much as needed to avoid any hassle or conflict... but I do so reluctantly.</p>
<p>There's no point in risking fines or conflict every time you go outside. Yes, we must resist the encroaching tyranny. But we must to it smartly. Just acting like a wiseass and getting in conflict every time you go outside because you don't comply with the measures imposed just isn't very productive...</p>

        <p>This is kinda the vibe I get where I am. During our months of lockdown we faced $5000 fines. With our economy trashed I'd say most people can't afford that or even some of the smaller fines.</p>
<p>I don't wear a mask ever and I've had no one ever look at me or treat me differently. I think most people here don't give a fuck about covid or masks or whatever but are afraid of the government locking us all down again.</p>

        <p>Had to make a post because you caught flak for wearing a mask lol. I go to Walmart where it’s “mandatory to wear a mask” just say “no thank you” and walk in. They’re not going to wrestle you to the ground and they’ll take your money like they take mine.</p>

        <p>Went to lunch with hubs at a BBQ joint.  Half the tables have chairs. The rest do not.  I realize there's more people than chairs.  I offer to move two of the four chairs from our table to a table with none.</p>
<p>OF ALL PEOPLE... my husband says: You can't do that.</p>
<p>Me:  Why not?</p>
<p>Because you're not supposed to.</p>
<p>Me: Do... ya think the cops are gonna swarm in here if I do? **moves chairs to another table anyway so the two people in line behind us had a place to sit**</p>
<p>PS. There's no shelter in place, social distancing, mask mandate... nada here.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure who and how your being trolled or getting shit on, however the more people comply with these rules, the farther they will stretch them. It starts with the grocery stores and then lands on your doorstep. The more they can "show" how the vast majority are in favor of this using videos an pictures of grocery stores with people masked up as their evidence the closer it moves towards your home. Before you know it, you and your kids will be forced to mask up just to stand on the front porch.</p>
<p>If people don't form a comradery and stand together in open defiance, there will be no stopping them from imposing more and more controls.</p>
<p>Just something to consider.</p>
<p>Cheers and take care!</p>

        <p>Have you tried shopping in a grocery store without a mask though? It can be fine.</p>
<p>I'm currently posting this using inflight wifi on an international flight that requires passengers to wear masks. I wore one to board, but for the last few hours I haven't been wearing one and no flight attendant has come up to me so far. If they do I'll wear it, you can do the same at your store.</p>
