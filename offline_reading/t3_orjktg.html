    <strong>Sick or dead from covid vs injured or dead from jab</strong>
    <p><p>I think someone going around asking if people know someone who was actually sick or died from covid vs injured or died from the jab. Fortunately I haven't seen any injury or death from the jab in my extended circle but we all know its happening, and  this ratio could be very telling.</p></p>

        <p>My healthy buddy died from "heart complications" 2 weeks after the jab. </p>
<p>No one's stating the obvious and my heart breaks everytime I see his boy.</p>

        <p>What is asymptomatic COVID?</p>
<p>We're changing the definitions of so many words now.</p>
<p>That sounds like a false positive test.</p>
<p>I have asymptomatic obesity, I think.</p>
<p>And you haven't known anybody harmed by the jab . . . YET.</p>
<p>I don't think we recognize the gravity of situation.</p>
<p>This is societal decay at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>The financial repercussions alone will cripple the average citizen and small business owner.</p>
<p>I don't know anyone who died of Covid personally, nor do I personally know anyone "injured" by the shot, outside on a few family members who claim to be umm , magnetic?  What's up with that?</p>
<p>I do know that many Medical staff we laid off and sitting at home while the others were making some lovely tiktok dance videos.  Hospitals here we're not over-run but there is a benefit to find a covid case so they test often and cycle high. </p>
<p>Tada  - another asymptomatic case.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, this is not directed at you - </p>
<p>I'm just exhausted of the BS.</p>

        <p>I am following the Thomas Renz case. I beleieve this is a rare honest attempt for truth to prevail. Of course I know it will outcome as yet another miscarriage of justice. Still I appreciate the efforts and support the family of God.</p>

        <p>The death rate among vaccinated people is close to but slightly lower than the overall death rate.  We will have better mortality statistics compiled in two or three years.  </p>
<p>In 2018 the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/mortality-trends/index.htm">death rate in USA was 723.6 people per 100,000</a>.  Covid19 killed <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us">189.1 people per 100,000 USA citizens</a> according to death certificates.  The overall death rate should be much lower than 912.7 because the pandemic spans 2 years and because some people who died from covid were going to die that year anyway.  Deaths from vaccines are statistically insignificant (would be significant to the one dead person though).  If we vaccinated everyone in USA the death rate in 2022 would rebound (fall) slightly because many elderly people died early in 2020 and 2021 so they will not be available to die in 2022.  </p>
<p>Injury is at near 200%.  No one has ever had a covid19 vaccination without getting stuck by at least one needle.  Injury rates for fully vaccinated Pfizer and Moderna is over 200% because at least a few people had car accidents on the way to the clinic and/or tripped while in line.  </p>
<p>Injury/death by television, vending machines, and shark attack are high enough to be measurable.  Television sets injured 8,500 people per year from 2015 to 2017.  More than 200 children under age 6 between died between 2000 and 2017.  Shark attack is likely to increase because vaccinated people are more likely to go to the beach.  Death by falling furniture/television may decrease when people are out but that might not be the case.  Pfizer and CDC will try to deny that the increased shark attacks are a side effect of the vaccination program.</p>

        <p>They are not available yet.  I expect them to be free where I work.  We usually have flu vaccines on site.  One year I missed the flu vaccine.  I did not get it at the pharmacy because I was going to get it free at work.  I was at a different building and missed the event.  Then I got influenza that year and it sucked.  Now I get my flu vaccine in August at  the pharmacy.  Usually within a week or two of the updated strains.  </p>
<p>Doctors were going to give me a tetanus booster when I had a work injury.  They could not because I had just had my covid19 shot.  That needs to be added to damage done by Pfizer shots.  There must be people who are now sick because they did not get any other vaccines during the 6 weeks after 1st Pfizer shot.  I am not sure where to find estimates for that number but it is definitely more than zero.  Tetanus sounds pretty horrible.</p>
