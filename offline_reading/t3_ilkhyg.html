    <strong>Fear ruining visits with my friends</strong>
    <p><p>Since about June some of my friends have been planning a weekend gathering in mid-September. Today, everyone who originally RSVPed in June was sent an email to confirm they were still coming. This new email was similar to the original but with an added “safety” section. </p>
<p>The safety section states that hand sanitizer and masks are to be used inside their house and alluded to the same outside. I understand that there are many people who will be there from out of state and are 65+ but most of us were together without masks and close together 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>I don’t know what has changed in the past 2 weeks but it really bugs me. They are extremely conservative and were bashing all the lockdown garbage in July. They always seemed to like masks though (wearing them outside ect.) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cancelled my RSVP because I’m not playing into utter ridiculousness. </p>
<p>I really wish fear and government overreach weren’t ruining the less than 5 times a year I get to see most of this friend group. One can only hope that next year we will be able to gather normally!</p></p>

        <p>I feel you. I wouldn’t want to go either if that’s how it was going to be. Maybe they’re watching too much media and are getting more afraid. It seems like things are getting better, but the media keeps it fueled with the whole second wave stuff.</p>

        <p>Out of curiosity is it more people at one time? Are the old people gonna be there? That might have made them change their mind for this event-not a shift in attitude.</p>

        <p>Probably 10-15 people would be there. Maybe 5 in the house at one time. In the email they hinted they were paranoid themselves about catching it. I don’t think the old people made them change their mind since we were all together maskless 2 weeks ago.</p>
