    <strong>Denied entrance to doctors office.</strong>
    <p><p>Short backstory:
My wife was in a very serious rollover accident toward the end of last year and we have been seeing lots of doctors for her bodily injuries and her brain injuries. She is finally showing signs of recovery, but she still has a hard time remembering things and can’t look at screens or take notes because of her concussion symptoms. Therefore I drive her everywhere and come with her to everything to help her cope mentally and physically with daily tasks and appointments as she is technically considered temporarily disabled.</p>
<p>Now:
We went to one of her doctors today and the front desk lady made a big deal of telling me that I can’t come back with her because they are trying to be safe. That’s fine but I’m not sick and I’m wearing my stupid mask anyway what difference does it make. I go on to tell her of her temporary disability and how I am pretty much her eyes and ears and brain until her post concussive symptoms go away as per another doctors orders and she told me that it didn’t matter and it was to protect everyone else’s health. </p>
<p>For the people in the back; ITS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP EVERYONE ELSE HEALTHY. IM NOT THEIR MOTHER OR THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM. </p>
<p>TLDR: Front desk lady denied appropriate assistance for my wife’s temporary disability because “everyone else is your responsibility”...</p></p>

        <p>This world is going to shit. Im getting really fed up of hearing that we are responsible for everyone now, when that has never EVER been the case. Yet people are stating it as if its something that has been known forever. </p>
<p>I hope you take this higher in the doctors surgery and get the appropriate treatment needed for your wife, with your support! Its absolutely shocking how they are treating non covid related issues!</p>

        <p>As a physician who works Covid, I’m sorry this happened to you.  It should not have.  One person is allowed to accompany anyone 1) under 18 or 2) requires assistance for cognitive defects, at least in the ER.  Now we are not required to provide you with appropriate PPE ( N95 or KN95), but often we will.  We have adult children sleeping in the hospital rooms next to their elderly parents. Now we don’t allow them to do that in the ICU, mainly because of space and HIPPA issues. They should have allowed you to come back with her if you had a mask on.</p>

        <p>My guess is the decision was made by the front desk person AKA a gatekeeper. I highly doubt that the actual physician knew that this was an issue for you up front.  If it’s a physician you want to keep, I would suggest you speaking with them and having a note put in the file so that front desk staff know that the patient needs a support person with them because they have cognitive deficits. If you Choose to go with a new physician, I would still suggest calling ahead so that if they have any special rules it can be addressed then (I.e. you need an N95). </p>
<p>I have also had to jump through hoops so I get it. Specifically my children’s schools initially had issues because “someone in their household was exposed to a Covid positive person in the last 14 days). I had this same issue with my optometrist front desk staff.  I finally had to speak to an administrator and the Optometrist to convince them that I will never not be in contact with a Covid patient.  It can be frustrating.</p>

        <p>There are two opposing classes in the production process - capitalists and working class. And then there are layers between them. Doctors, teachers, policemen, artistic intelligentia etc is the layer that serves the interests of the ruling class which owns the means of production, i.e. largest capital. They are <strong>servants</strong>. So don't expect a servant to oppose the commands of the master. A servant has been trained to serve without questioning, that's how they get food on their table.</p>

        <p>How can walking down a hall into a private room put others at risk anyway? She would not have been able to answer that question. It’s all so asinine and absolutely none of the rules make any sense whatsoever. The world we knew is gone forever. We may win some battles along they way but things will never be what they were ever again.</p>
