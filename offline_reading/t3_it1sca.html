        <p>The only problem i have with this whole video is the fact that he agrees to mask or close non essential businesses till the numbers go down, the problem with this is the numbers are down and these restrictions are not being reduced. We cannot trust that these measures will be walked back. He mentions people think this will keep going and going each year and that's because we see even after numbers drop significantly restrictions are not removed. These actions speak louder then the words of those same governors implementing the lockdowns/mask/social distancing. I would have liked to hear his opinion on what he feels is a safe number to start removing the restrictions. Personally i don't agree with any of them being forced. Voluntary is the only way to go, such as with Sweden</p>

        <p>I can't say I disagree with you on that. Voluntary is the only way. If a business wants to deny me entry because I'm not wearing a mask, that's their right, it's their property. And those business owners that want to give people a mask-free option have their right as well. Would rather we "regulated" each other organically as well -- the top down solutions not only don't work, they cause infinitely more suffering. So I'm right there with you</p>

        <p>one of those things people are gonna debate about for years, do a lockdown and wreck the economy, people s livelihood etc etc dont do a lockdown then see the cases rise exponentially, countries like south korea that did not do a lockdown had people following rules rigorously like wearing masks, social distancing etc, what about you?</p>

        <p>As the good Doctor points out in this video above, it makes 0 sense for a place like the United States, especially once case numbers got past just a few. We had the virus coming from both directions (West &amp; East Coast), are not a communist dictatorship, are supposed to support freedom of choice, etc.</p>
<p>I don't think the social distancing measures were necessarily bad, but using the law to the enforce them IS. If you have so much evidence (not YOU specifically, I'm speaking generally here), such good arguments about wearing masks, etc, you should have to CONVINCE people to fall in line, you shouldn't be able to COERCE them using force and threats.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the countries that "successfully" locked down &amp; suppressed the virus, such as New Zealand, have two choices: Stay completely cut off from the world, or accept that they too will eventually have to deal with the virus themselves. There is no other option. Japan will also eventually have to make that choice, and with tourism being such a large part of their economy, I doubt they will opt to force people to take inconvenient tests and quarantine for 14 days after arrival for the rest of time (or until a vaccine is discovered, which is unlikely).</p>
<p>The Measles Vaccine, the fastest vaccine ever developed in human history, took 4 years to develop / bring to market (1960 - 1964). We have still never beaten this record, and measles is easier to make a vaccine for than a Coronavirus. In short, they are just as fucked as anyone else, and they've just delayed their pain, at a great cost to their financial stability (and thus, human health stability).</p>
