    <strong>Doomers Have Ruined Everything. But Somehow, We Are The Problem.</strong>
    <p><p>You Doomers, rather than worrying about the top 3 main causes of death in the world, which is heart attack, stroke and respiratory infections, instead you have sold yourselves for fucking Krispy Kreme donuts and have easily been influenced by all the propaganda and brainwashing in a flash for a "disease" which has 99.7% survival rate. Yes. 99.7 fucking percent. How more fucking dumb can you get? This covid is not even the #1 killer in the world, and there is no reason for these tyrants to destroy the economy/mental sanity/lockdowns and that's what we have been saying since the beginning! But somehow, we are the villains?</p>
<p>You fuckers are being lab rats for something that has been made in a rush (average vaccine development takes 7-10 years) and this "vaccine" was created in 1 year and the long term effects of this gene changing mrna bs isn't even known. And your "prize" for being a good little obedient lab rat is those fucking Krispy kreme donuts, which ironically will kill you by a heart attack. Even you jokers aren't that vulnerable to covid, but yet have sold yourselves eternally to the government.</p>
<p>You call Us conspiracy theorists? You dumb fucks. Everything we have been saying since last year is all coming true right in front of our eyes. You thought vaccine passports was a "conspiracy theory?" Look at it now.  You verbally and physically harass us everyday for failing to comply to your new normal. Fuck masks. Fuck lockdowns. But you doomers love them! Why? Because when you get more fucking fat eating those donuts, your excuses will be "gyms are closed." But the real reason is, you fat lazy fucks cannot get off your asses and never had any lives prior to lockdown. So, this is the right time to shine for you doomers and virtue signal us, for the normal things we did prior to covid and the normal things we want to do now. </p>
<p>You clowns fear everyone. Why the fuck does anyone double mask on top of wearing a mask? Wtf do you have to hide? Well, of course you have to hide your faces in shame and those cum stains on your faces left by your master fauci. Your so ashamed but at the same time happy at that fact (because master fauci put you in your place good) that you hide your faces in shame. No wonder.</p>
<p>You conveniently overlook suicides, people being denied medical treatment in favor/fear of Covid, victims being locked up with their abusers, small businesses getting wrecked, government's growing tyranny with power and blatantly flaunting their own rules, your friends and families collective-mental health plummeting, children's education and development suffering, and the figures and statistics from States like Florida and Texas which have gone down, in your retar-ded, psychopathic endorsement of lockdowns and face masks. </p>
<p>You fauci slaves are the real problem. But yet, you call us names? You are spineless, cowards who are afraid to face the truth that this has all been an overblown meme virus for which you have sacrificed more than a year of your life and countless friendships and relationships to defeating. You have dug a hole so fucking deep that we can never go back to the old normal. The more masks you wear, the more lockdown you get and the more fucks you get in the ass by gov and fauci only makes you more obedient to them. The real problem is not Us. It's you. You had no lives prior to this covid and in this "plandemic" you doomers found a job, which is to virtue signal us and dictate us to be obedient to the government like yourselves. Go F yourselves and go back to sucking off Fauci. Don't harass or troll Us on this sub.</p></p>

        <p>Oh, the survival rate is higher even than 99.7%—it’s about 99.9%, given that the <a href="https://covidusa.net">official IFR is 1.8%</a>, but according to the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">only 6% of that is COVID alone</a>.</p>

        <p>People die from alcohol, smoking, obesity, depression, and other mental illness but nobody cares, a lot of homeless people around the world but nobody cares. Then flu comes in that is full of lies and elites start to care about the population that much they close everything, silence everyone, acts like fascists but FOR YOUR GOOD... Cmon people how dumb you must be to believe they care about you, they want to give this gene therapy to kids!! And sheep's run into the slaughterhouse with smiles on their faces.</p>
