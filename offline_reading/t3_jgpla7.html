    <strong>Many People Accept Constant Changes in the Narrative Because They Aren't Actually Interested in Finding the Truth, They're Mostly Looking for Social Acceptance from a Culture That Demands Increasing Amounts of Conformity</strong>
    <p><p>Back in late January and February, I was concerned about the new Coronavirus before most people paid much notice to it at all, back when the name COVID didn't exist yet. I'm not sure how many here were following the situation closely at that time, but back then the few who were taking it seriously tended to be on the political right, although the majority of both those on the left and the right weren't paying too much attention yet. I remember when Trump closed the border with China and people were saying it was racist. I remember when the opinion of those who considered themselves the smart, educated ones tended toward saying that anyone scared of the Coronavirus was an idiot, they should worry more about the flu. I remember when r/Wuhan_Flu was quarantined for being too doomerish. Actually, that sub was open to all opinions and didn't censor like the doomer subs do now. There were a certain number of outlandish doomers there, but I had seen enough data, mostly through that sub, to convince me that the mortality was fairly low and it wasn't close to the apocalypse by the end of February, before the mass freakout began. I still thought at that time the mortality might be 1 or even 2 percent, but considering it hit primarily people who didn't have long to live anyway, even that would be far from apocalyptic. Close to 1 percent of Americans die in an average year in general.</p>
<p>Seeing the narrative change so many times since then, on the seriousness of the virus, on masks, from flattening the curve to trying to eliminate the virus, and watching people change their opinions in lockstep with the narrative, has really increased my cynicism regarding the ability of people to think critically. At his point, I don't see more than a small percent of the population as even attempting to actually do research toward figuring out the facts of what's actually happening. I understand that we only have so many hours in a day, there's plenty of subjects that I haven't personally had the time to come to much understanding of. I can respect people who just want to do other things with their lives and not pay too much attention to COVID. It's the ones who have such strong opinions and self-righteousness while not bothering to do their own research that I can't stand.</p>
<p>All subcultures can develop groupthink, and we should be careful not to fall too much into our own groupthink here. However, the doomer groupthink is what has so much power and influence in so much of the world right now. The people that I see as most prone to this sort of groupthink right now are the ones that see themselves as the smart, educated, knowledgeable people, the good people who (according to them) the rest of the world should follow. Most among this group that I know don't really seem all that interested in finding the truth, it's more about being up to date on what the narrative they're expected to believe is and parroting it when needed, thus proving to others in their group that they're one of the good people too. It's amazing how many people confuse this conformity to the narrative with actual intelligence, and assume that anyone who thinks differently must be too stupid to know better (or have evil intentions). Thus, when the narrative changes to completely contradict what was said before, they don't bat an eye, or explain it away by saying that it was wrong before, but now we know better. To that, I say, if you admit in the past that the official narrative has been very wrong on many things, wouldn't you expect that to still be the case now? Who knows what sort or things accepted now will sometime in the future be seen as anything from simply strange to repugnant?</p>
<p>The question in my mind is, how many people who are parroting the narrative have a certain amount of doubt in their own mind but are afraid to speak out, lest they be cast out of their social circles, or even lose their job. I'm lucky that I mostly don't have to hide my skepticism in my personal situation, mostly the people who'd hate me for it are people who I don't need in my life anyway. I am more careful about what I say to certain family members who I don't want a rocky relationship with, but they're all a distance away and I only occasionally have to communicate with them.</p>
<p>I wonder if there will end up being an "Emperor Has No Clothes" moment when the doomer narrative collapses and people who have private doubts feel empowered enough to speak them out if they realize that enough other people do too. I can't imagine the doomers will disappear, but if they lose the illusion of being a majority they may have to retreat into their own angry bubbles. If Trump wins the election by a more significant margin than in 2016, the narrative may collapse shortly thereafter. I have a lot of issues with Trump, BTW, but at this point Biden and the doomer Democrats in general look far worse to me.</p></p>

        <p>Two years ago when I worked in a store, the assistant manager once said to me, in reference to when he worked at my level, "My boss told me you get paid to do, not to think". This was a 40+ year old man telling a young woman she shouldn't think for herself. I was immediately very uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns have made me feel a lot more empathy with flat-earthers and all the other "crazy conspiracy people", and also made me think that our current approach to these people is completely wrong. I don't think the earth is flat, but so what if it is? How does it impact my life if some internet rando thinks that is true? It doesn't, so I shouldn't concern myself with it. In particular, all the internet screeching about these people - making fun of them, saying how dumb they are, making memes about them, etc - is pointless. It's not going to change their mind, just like somebody calling me a dumb anti-masker isn't going to change my mind. This culture of making jokes at the expense of people who don't believe "obvious truths" will have no impact on these people's opinions and just means that other people will be more reluctant to question things or share unpopular opinions, as they fear the wrath of the hivemind turning on them.</p>

        <p>To be truly open-minded is to be willing to consider even ideas that might be socially unpopular. Iâ€™ve never understood the contempt people seem to have for these individuals. At the very least, their ideas make things interesting.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I LOVE firing back at the "Be open minded but not so much that your brains fall out!" implies there is a measurable, objective line, and I ask them to show me where that is. Conversation usually ends when you get hyper rational LOL. My line is conceptual consistency. You can't take a left at the corner in an upward right direction. There are adults that think that's possible and language is just a conspiracy against the poor, like everything else lol.</p>

<p>Same with me regarding anti-vaccine people. I never cared about the flat-earth theory, so can't comment on that, but the way the COVID-19 vaccine is being pushed is scary. I'm very much for vaccines in general, but I do now think the antis have a point (no pun intended).</p>

        <p>The anti-vaxx stuff seemed nuts because there was no context yet. Now you see it lol. It's a very good possibility they'll push a mandatory vax to return to work, school, etc. Chip you and your bank account so when you say logically correct economic facts on the internet they can fine you for wrong speak.</p>

        <p>For sure, same here - I don't want to be forced into taking the vaccine! And the more that I think about it, the more that I can empathise with the anti-vaxxers. They don't want to take a vaccine, that's their personal choice. Doesn't matter if it's stupid, they have the right to make that decision. I know some people argue that it's dangerous they won't get their kids vaccinated, but for the first time I've managed to see it from their perspective. You're being forced into doing something that you think is bad and harmful, while everyone is telling you that it's necessary and good. It's the exact same way I feel about masks and lockdowns. Throughout this experience I've gained a huge amount of  understanding of people I would previously have dismissed as stupid or crazy.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'd say that conformity is a large part of it. Growing up, I found out that most people are NPCs, somewhat mindless automatons who can't think for themselves. The media and the elites know this, and drop heavy misinformation in order to control them. </p>
<p>If the media just said that Corona doesn't even exist and stopped talking about it, the NPCs would forget about it too, well, maybe not, due to the economic damage from these lockdowns used to stave off the virus. It's gotten to the point where the media and elites HAVE to lie now because they've backed themselves into corner where they made Corona into a thing where only seasonal vaccines can get rid of it, and lockdowns will continue until they appear.</p>

        <p>What really gets me is stupid people don't know they're stupid, but everyone else has to pay for that, plus the emotional toll of knowing better while large groups of people do the opposite, and exemplify a completely undue sense of pride, accomplishment, and smugness in the process.</p>

        <p>I was wondering this. For instsnce, everyone wears their stupid masks everywhere. At my studio, they are not required bec I dont believe in them, its a 4000 sq ft building and only a few students at a time so I am not even concerned. But what I have noticed, is that I have only one student, across the entire student base, who wears a mask. </p>
<p>They see that we arenâ€™t and they feel comfortable to take theirs off, too. </p>
<p>We have only truly closed for 2 weeks. We operated as a speakeasy the rest of the time. Knock on wood, no one has been sick.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve seen the same thing in the gym, people come in with a mask on, see that nobody else is wearing one and take it off. I wish people could just have a backbone and do what they think is right, not just blindly try to fit in.</p>

        <p>&rt;The question in my mind is, how many people who are parroting the narrative have a certain amount of doubt in their own mind but are afraid to speak out, lest they be cast out of their social circles</p>
<p>This seems to be the case in my observation. But that doubt is not necessarily as troubling to them as (judging by your post) it might be to you. I am hearing a lot of Pontius Pilate-esqe "what is truth?" type reactions when people can no longer avoid the countervailing information. They kind of know they're being lied to, but the potential social consequences of finding out more are not really worth it. So they'll just step back and let other people take responsibility for figuring it out.</p>
<p>(Needless to say this is usually people whose lockdown lifestyles are fairly comfortable.)</p>

        <p>One of the most daunting revelations I had recently was the opinion of a very brilliant young doctor whom I admire, who consistently for many years held non conformist ideas against the medical groupthink in numerous areas. He believes the IFR is below 0.2% (personally I'm a bit less optimistic) and that herd immunity threshold is low and yet advocated for lockdowns with the argument that it could "save 0.05% of the population" in a country where the overall yearly mortality is 10x of that.</p>
<p>I know him for years, never before was he a "save all lives" fundamentalist, never have I heard him in the winter advocating for flu vaccines or taking fecal occult blood tests or doing yearly skin tests for Melanoma, all can save a lot of lives. But suddenly he supports imprisoning the entire population for months for a mediocre overall mortality benefit, mostly among people with relatively short lifespan and low quality of life.</p>
<p>And he won't even engage me in a debate. It's just flabbergasting.</p>
<p>I guess he just caved in to the social pressure in the hospital he works in.</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s called virtue signalling. Everyone just follows the same narrative as it will present them with a sense of appreciation when they receive likes and followers on social media even though behind closed doors their opinions are the complete opposite of those they spout online. </p>
<p>Problem is, anyone who disagrees with the most popular directive of a particular narrative are completely shot down. Itâ€™s psychological war fare and it leads people into weird echo chambers.</p>

        <p>Very true very well said.. The people (doomers) at my work (grocery store) are in the leftist subculture that finally has a chance to feel empowered by calling out people without masks or turn in employees who speak out against the narrative. When I have seen them not social distancing or maskless around eachother so they don't care to look into anything to do with the virus as long as the MSM and Libiral bureaucrats keep putting them on a pedestal</p>

        <p>This right here is why it was a mistake to get rid of bullying in schools. Back in the day if you were a deviant you'd get the shit kicked out of you until you learned to be normal. Nowadays the deviant has no consequences, so he keeps pushing and pushing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour further, until we're at the level we have now where children are being injected with estrogen and surgically castrated at schools by public school teachers without their parents even knowing about it.</p>

        <p>It's not about deviance, the very existence of government schools provides a perfect opportunity for children to be indoctrinated by the government. Not being allowed to kick your bully in the nuts is just part of that</p>
<p>What I'm talking about though is how the true goal of these supposed oppressed people isn't equality, it's revenge. What they really want is to switch roles so they are the ones in power doling out the abuse</p>

        <p>This post is spot on. People confuse conformity with actual objective intelligence. This was obvious when many hypocritically supported BLM protests despite the lack of social distancing, just because it was trendy to support. The same people supporting the lockdowns and masks now will SWEAR they NEVER supported it if the narrative changes next year. Critical thinking is not common, its all about fitting in and conforming to what your social group thinks is intelligent. People don't care about the negative consequences of the lockdowns as long as they are fitting in with their group. People care too much about what other people think about them.</p>
