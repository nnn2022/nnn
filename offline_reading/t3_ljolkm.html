    <strong>Questions about a fact-checking website "disproving" a video that said 'masks don't work'</strong>
    <p><p>So this fact-checking website (very pretentious in my humble opinion) made this article 'disproving' said video. in the article, they say that the video is false, but their claim is that the data on the study is insufficient to prove it, but it doesn't necessarily disprove it either.</p>
<p>But that's not the end of it. One spokesman on CDC wanted to distance themselves from the study, and for that cited a separate CDC study. This one involved 139 clients who were served by two hair stylists with Covid, and all of them wore masks.  </p>
<p>My problem with the study above is that, first, it was made with the assumption that masks work. <br>
Ok, but also it did not include a group of non-maskers, to compare the results with the group that wore a mask.  </p>
<p>My question is, without a control group, can the study be consider valid? Can it actually be used to conclude anything? This is a legit question, That's the impression I got but I'm not 100% sure about it.</p>

<p>The masks do something’s but these mask police have no fucking desire to hear the truth. Mayo said. John’s Hopkins said. Cleveland clinic said. You can get Covid thru eyes. The maskers believed when they said no mask. Then the believed in one mask. Now it’s two mask. Then it’s vaccine but still mask. I’ve posted this on here before but anything less than Singapore type protocols.. we might as well herd immunity. Most people don’t wear the mask. Cities with mass transit don’t social distance. Nurses despite Tiktok.. absolutely aren’t always wearing masks. I am close friends with at least a dozen nurses from my past employment. None of it is happening here. We didn’t obey it in 1918 and we didn’t stop smoking. We still may not wear seatbelts or motorcycle helmets. It’s a fucking circle jerk. No one gives a shit what some fucker on cnn is telling us. I’d literally ask a inmate on death row for advice over our government. Fraudci is a fucking liar. If they care about my health then they should see my arteries from my diet. Not a mask.</p>

        <p>Not to mention people don’t change their masks every few hours as they should and they constantly touch them with dirty hands. So if they’re not gonna wear it properly why wear it at all.</p>

        <p>That too. Also I bet a large portions of mask I see aren’t over both nose and mouth. Also .. people also refuse to understand that if it’s not sealed it doesn’t really block as much droplets as people think. Beards or goatees .. my beard looks like a lagomorph is sitting on my face. The mask doesn’t touch my skin. Lol.</p>

        <p>You are exactly right that the hair stylist "study" proves nothing because they don't have a control group.  In fact Florida has many salons open where people aren't wearing masks and yet there is no evidence covid is spreading in these places.</p>
<p>The CDC is now simply a propaganda arm of the federal government and they have no interests in conducting a proper study on this issue.</p>
