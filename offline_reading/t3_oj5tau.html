    <strong>List of things we have to stop doing and saying.</strong>
    <p><p>This list would’ve probably been way better served earlier on, but I still figured it would be better to post it than to not post it. These are just some things that we as freedom-loving people need to stop doing and saying.</p>
<p>For the record, this is as much for myself as it is for anyone else. I am guilty of all of these at some point or another.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“I won’t follow government mask mandates, but if a private business tells me to wear a mask I’ll do it“ I’ll put an exception on this, if it’s a small family owned business, then I would say you should respect their rules. But if this is like Walmart or Kroger, you are a stooge if you wear a mask in there. Private companies can be just as bad, sometimes worse than government tyranny. They are not your friends, and they are not affected by any of these shut downs at all. The Walton family does not give a shit about you. Neither does Tim Cook. Neither does John Mackey, Roger Goodell, or Bernard Kroger. They’ve all profited huge from this pandemic. They like the pandemic, they are not on your team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please stop talking about the politicians who support lockdowns as stupid. The laws themselves might be stupid, but the people enacting them are NOT stupid. Stupid would imply they are doing harm, but not doing so intentionally. But they’re doing harm and they know exactly what they’re doing. They are not stupid, they are evil. So whenever you hear new potential policies from these people that sound idiotic, do not laugh it off, because they are in power and you’re not. You should be scared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please God, stop saying “I won’t wear a mask because it’s hard to breathe :(“. It might be hard for you to breathe, I understand that. But good God you sound like such a bitch when you talk like that. It is impossible for anyone to take you seriously. It is a legitimate problem and I wish things were different, but the second you say that, people start making fun of how weak the anti-masker is. How about instead of not wearing the mask because you can’t breathe, how about you say “I won’t wear a mask because it is my right.“ or you could also say “I won’t wear a mask because the mandate is dumb and the person enacting it is evil.” Or better yet, say nothing. You do not owe anyone an explanation as to why you will not wear a mask. The people that will ask you why you’re not wearing a mask will certainly try to make you feel like you owe them something, but you need to stay focused and remember that you don’t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know this sub isn’t exclusively right wing, but I know there is a lot of overlap between blue lives matter type people and this sub, so this is a reminder to stay skeptical of the police. I genuinely believe that 99.999% police are good people and will not enforce these draconian laws, and there are even several examples of refusing to enforce these laws. But if we’re in lockdown #23 ten years from now and you’re having over more than one person at your house who doesn’t live there for a get-together, and your nosy neighbors find out, who are they going to call? They’re going to call the police. When the government wants to infringe on your rights, they are going to call on the police to do so. As I said before, I do believe almost every single cop in the country would refuse to enforce something like door to door vaccinations, but that doesn’t change the fact that they still could totally do it if they wanted to. In other words, support them when they are serving your community, and call them out when they are harming your community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop buying from the big retailers and websites as much as possible. You hear the term “multinational corporation“ thrown around a lot. It’s sort of outdated at this point. Amazon is not multinational, they are post national. They are beyond the concept of nations. At any given time, Bezos can pick up and move wherever he wants. He doesn’t mind if America gets ran into the ground because he can always go to Canada. And if Canada gets ran into the ground, he can always go to Switzerland, and so on. The problem with that is that Bezos, and others in similar positions now have zero incentive to actually care about this country. The United States is a stock to them. They’ll hold onto it as long as it’s profitable korma but once it isn’t anymore, they run and sell it. They’ll milk it for all it’s worth, and then they’ll go milk the next cow. Furthermore, all of these giants tripled their net worth over the pandemic. They are going to do just fine without your business. Support small American owned businesses, particularly ones that will not uphold these bullshit mandates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, enough with relying on the cold and logical arguments. They’re great, and the best part about logical arguments based in fact is that you cannot refute them. Emotional arguments will always work at least 1000x better. That doesn’t mean you can’t use logical arguments, it just means that completely ignoring the emotional side of this problem is doing you no favors. Do you know who’s great at leveraging emotional arguments? The Covid doomers. They are amazing at it. That’s why they’re winning big time right now. So instead of giving statistics about the economy or inflation or herd immunity, how about you instead just remind people that there are people who lost everything because of the lockdowns. Family businesses that had been built over generations of hard work have been completely destroyed in the last year. How about you remind them of all the children who’ve gone missing since the switch to virtual? How about you mention all of the suicides, drug use, domestic abuse? How about you mention the mothers that had to give birth alone, the elderly people that had to die alone because hospitals wouldn’t let other people in the room? So many actual great and factually correct emotional arguments to use, and yet y’all never cease to whip out the damn percentages lmao.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If there’s anything you feel like we should stop doing or saying, feel free to leave it below.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with a lot of this, but you do you. Half what got us all in this mess is trying to tell one another what to do. The sentiment is appreciated though.</p>

        <p>We’re right, they’re wrong, that’s why I can justify telling people what to do. Correct power plus correct person equals correct result.</p>
<p>I’m not dehumanizing or attempting to strip them of their rights. Just telling people to stand up for their freedoms.</p>

        <p>A bit of disagreement-
1 Reverse that. If a small business you can talk to the one in charge. They have the power to change their policy. "You want a mask? I will not shop here." Screaming at the cashier at Walmart does nothing, they can't change Corporate policy even if they want to, not can the Manager. But again, you can refuse to shop there!</p>
<p>2 &amp;3 I agree.</p>
<p>4- Oh, but they WILL!!!!! </p>
<p>5 is just taking an extra step to support the mega-corporations. Unless they make what they sell, they buy it from the same supplier. </p>
<p>6 Meh, I prefer facts over bullshit. Use both if you really want to try heartstrings.</p>

        <p>People losing everything from government shutdowns is not “bullshit” but go ahead and keep throwing stats and percentages at people who don’t understand basic math and see where that gets you.</p>

        <p>Yet without the stats showing people that lost everything, it IS just bullshit. Let's use a newly admitted stat- 30% more drug overdoses last year. Not bullshit, but if you don't care because it is a statistic, then why would you care no matter how you dress it up? </p>
