    <strong>To all of you</strong>
    <p><p>Edit: I'll be taking care of some things for now. I will probably rejoin the discussion later. I just want to stress that i only seek to have a civil discussion with you all. You dont have to change your opinion and you can try to change mine but please stay civilised.</p>
<p>I just stumbled across this sub and looked through some of thr posts here.</p>
<p>Tl;dr:
Yes this is not normal and some measures are bad. Still the virus is dangerous and not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>I understand that this situation is very much not normal but id like to point something out.
The problem is mostly in the way certain countries (looking at you usa) dealt or deal with this situation. I saw quite a few post that seem to claim the virus itself is not real or not dangerous. It is and that is very clear.
My point is:
Please keep in mind that the way countries deal with the problem can sometimes be itself problematic. And its not that the virus is unproblematic.
Also while some of these actions are stupid and harmful not all are. A lockdown is a good thing as long as it is properly done and in a way that does more good than harm, the same with other measures.</p>
<p>Im open for discussion though and i do not mean to bad mouth you sub.</p></p>
