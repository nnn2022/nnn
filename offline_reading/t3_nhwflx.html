    <strong>My uncle wants me to get the vaccine for my grandma</strong>
    <p><p>Before I start, I just want to say that while my account is new, I’ve been lurking this subreddit for awhile and I love you guys. You all have made me feel less alone while everyone around me blindly has gotten the vaccine. I truly appreciate you all.</p>
<p>Anyway, my uncle texted me about a week ago saying that he wants to visit my sister and I with my grandma in the next couple of months. My sister who is vaccinated threw me under the bus and told him I wasn’t vaccinated. He isn’t going to be cool with my reasons for not getting the vaccine, and I don’t want to lie to my grandma especially when that means I will have to enlist my entire family to lie as well. I’m not going to be stupid enough to see her if I’m sick, so why should it matter if I’m vaccinated as well. What do you all think I should do and how should I go about my potential lie?</p>
<p>And to anyone who reads this and is planning to screech at me and tell me I’m a selfish bitch who’s going to kill my grandma: I don’t give a fuck what you think. I’m not getting the vaccine and insulting me is not going to get me to want to take it. Stop being so predictable and don’t bother.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, cutting people out of my life completely has been <em>way</em> easier than I thought it would be. I actually feel noticeably less anxiety as well.</p>
<p>Having said that, it's not easy to just cut out family - especially if you live with them - and there isn't always somewhere else to go. </p>
<p>It's a tough situation, and in yours, I would personally choose to just not be present. You never know, it might be your uncle driving this whole thing and your grandma doesn't even care. She might tell you to be there anyway.</p>

        <p>Why do these people think you’re supposed to take a vaccine for others?   I thought the whole point of a vaccine was to protect yourself - and you probably would take it if healthy people were dropping in the streets.  If that’s not the case, why do they give 6 month olds shots for stuff that “others” would not catch from them?  Covid has been great for instantly identifying people who can’t think for themselves.</p>

        <p>You could be truthful and just tell them if they don't want to have you because you're unvaccinated then so be it. I don't think lying through this is a good idea personally but if you are trying to go and know they won't let you go if you're unvaxxed, then I don't have advice for that situation.</p>
<p>If they really wanted to be with you, they'd be with you whether you're vaccinated or not.</p>

<p>I think my grandma would understand but my uncle won’t. I don’t care much for seeing him but it’s my grandma I want to see. I’m just trying not to rock the boat.</p>

        <p>Do you have a car and license? If you do and your grandma wants to see you whether you're vaccinated or not then it probably wouldn't be a bad idea just driving or getting yourself over there and skipping the process of having your uncle pick you up.</p>

        <p>Do that, screw him. If he tries to talk shit just point out that hes policing your grandma on behalf of the tv and that shits weird af. If he spouts anything about "protecting" grandma point out that hes really just protecting his ideology. I assume your grandma wants to see you, go see her and hug her</p>

        <p>Dpn't lie, it never turns out well.  is there a reason your grandma isn't vaccinated?  Can you visit with her outdoors?  Can you isolate yourself to vaccinated people only for the two weeks before the visit?  You have a lot of options here.</p>

        <p>If grandma, your uncle, and everyone else is vaccinated there is nothing for them to be afraid of, if they are afraid, i just wouldn't go. </p>
<p>I would offer to take  a PCR test, but that's the limits you want to go to with <em>your</em> medical choices. What they think is irrelevant, they are not at risk.</p>
