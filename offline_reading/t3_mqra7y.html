    <strong>Has anyone here been to a movie theater since the panoramic all began? What was your experience like?</strong>
    <p><p>Thinking about going to the movie theater with my friend this weekend. Haven't been there in a year, and really just want to get out.</p>
<p>However, the ridiculous amount of security theater and insane restrictions whenever I go out to public places, makes me wonder if it's even worth it. </p>
<p>Like seriously, I almost feel like I'm better off watching movies from my own home than sitting in a dark room with faceless, masked zombies who are now trying not to laugh too loud or make any noise. It's like being in an episode of the Twilight Zone.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been to the movie theater since the panoramic began, what was your experience like, and we're there a lot of people?</p></p>

        <p>A theater is the only place where I would support the new normal bs of distancing. That buffer would be nice since most movie goers eat their popcorn like they haven't had a decent meal in days or act as if they're in their own living room.</p>
<p>That said, "Nobody" looks pretty good.</p>

        <p>I went to see Tenet last summer and then saw Nobody a few weeks ago. Honestly I think it’s going to depend on where you live. I live in an area where people are serious about masking but that’s about it. Without the masking you probably wouldn’t know anything is wrong. Both times the experience was fine. Both theaters were about 30% full (which seems like what they would have been normally for the times/theaters i went to). When I saw the movie a few weeks ago they made one person in two person “party” leave a name and phone number. I’ve never left a real name or phone number so that doesn’t bother me. Everyone seemed to take their masks off as soon as they sat down and people engaged with the movie like they normally would. I’ve actually noticed the hygiene theater really ramping down lately. Social distancing stickers are all but jokes and the hand sanitizer jugs at the front of every shop are getting dusty.</p>

        <p>I went to see Tenet twice in September. It was a ghost town - probably like 15 other people in the theater. Good to have like a whole row to yourself &amp; not worry about how loud you’re eating popcorn. I’d imagine they’re a bit more full now though</p>

        <p>I'm in Utah, and the theater by my house has been open since last summer. I went to as many movies in the theater last year as I normally do. It was like going to a restaurant. You wear a mask when you walk in, then take it off, and then some people will put them on when they go to the bathroom. For me, it was not bad at all. At some movies there were lots of people, at others we were the only ones there. I just love going to the theater and getting some popcorn. The 2 biggests issues are: </p>
<p>Because of social distancing rules programmed into the seat selection part of the app, trying to buy tickets online for a family of 6 it can be unnecessarily restrictive and you might have to split your group if there are a lot of people going to that showing.</p>
<p>There aren't many good movies out. I've seen Tenet, Wonder Woman, Godzilla VS Kong, The Croods, Raya and the Last Dragon, and a bunch of classic movies like Back to the Future and Jurassic Park.</p>

        <p>I’m in Tacoma, WA, and surrounded by the Covid Cult. That said, the theater was fine with limited seating. The insanity came when you try to pump butter to only find out that they don’t have that for Covid security theater. So you have touched it, but no butter. No refills, because...Covid. Social distancing stickers on the floor that are readily ignored. Lots of reminders of a world gone mad, but still enjoyable.</p>

        <p>"Covid cult" is definitely accurate. Last night, I was at the gas station quite late. As I was driving away, I saw an older guy near a crosswalk by himself wearing a face mask despite it being late at night and not a single person or car around. WTF?</p>
