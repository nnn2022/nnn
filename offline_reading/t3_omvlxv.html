    <strong>My family is deranged.</strong>
    <p><p>I posted a lengthy comment about this in the weekly chat, but I want to talk about it more. I‚Äôm feeling very conflicted and lost.</p>
<p>I was eighteen in March of 2020 when we went into lockdown. I have very liberal parents and I‚Äôve been sick of their shit for the past few years. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go anywhere. I couldn‚Äôt have friends over. I had a pretty good job at a jewelry store but I had to quit. Personally, I didn‚Äôt know much about COVID and was a bit scared, but it angered me that my parents were trying to control me like that. I wasn‚Äôt ready to move out and live on my own so I couldn‚Äôt really say anything.</p>
<p>My friends had the times of their lives in late spring of last year. They went on a road trip and hung out at the beach all the time. I was just watching from afar, listening to the stories they had to tell afterwards. I got sick of being at home all the time so I decided to head out with my friends. My parents were not happy when I got home. They gave me a long lecture about how I need to be more responsible. I was obviously not interested and my dad told me he‚Äôd break my legs so I can‚Äôt leave the house. He‚Äôd never said anything like that to me before and I knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>I became incredibly lonely. I met a man on a Toyota truck forum and we began to chat. Soon enough we were talking every night. Even though I‚Äôd never met him, I fell in love. He helped me stay positive and was planning a trip to come see me in the summer. </p>
<p>In June, my parents were told they came into contact with someone who had COVID. They got tested and wanted me to too. I said no. They screamed at me and tried to drag me out to the car. My dad knows I have a bad shoulder and grabbed my arm in a way that would hurt it. I hit him as hard as I could and he let me go. I was so scared. My parents had never been this violent or angry.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, my parents told me I was going to get the vaccine once it came out, and of course I said no. We argued for days on end. They kept saying I may be an adult but I‚Äôm still their kid and they can punish me. After the fight I had with them a few weeks before, I was terrified. I told the man I met about it and he was going to come pick me up. I said I‚Äôd be there in a couple days. I packed up my truck and left in the middle of the night. I drove about two days and a couple states over to him. I‚Äôve been living with him for about a year now. We‚Äôre in love and plan on getting married and possibly having a baby in the next couple years.</p>
<p>I stayed low-contact with my parents and they came to visit once. They want me to come home but show no signs of feeling remotely sorry about what they did to me. I told them I wasn‚Äôt coming home and they got nasty with me. For context, I‚Äôm now 20 and my boyfriend is 31. My parents say it‚Äôs disgusting and they‚Äôre going to ‚Äúhire an attorney‚Äù to deal with it. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to cut my family off, but I feel like it‚Äôs getting to that point. My parents just can‚Äôt fucking calm down and my siblings are starting to side with them. I‚Äôm making new friends where I live now and things are getting better. I‚Äôm thinking of seeking legal action against my parents, but it might be too late. Oh well.</p></p>

        <p>The irony of "very liberal" parents not letting you do anything....</p>
<p>And if you're 20, they can waste their money on court fees if they want, but I highly doubt a court will even hear their case. You're an adult. </p>
<p>Sorry they are so unreasonable. Just love them anyway and live your life. Good luck to you.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry. This really sucks.</p>
<p>For your own physical and mental wellbeing cut them off. Completely.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that lightly, but from the information you provided they consider you property not a person.</p>
<p>Nothing good will come from maintaining any contact, and I fear that when they realize you'll no longer respond to them they will try other means to regain some sort of control over you.</p>
<p>There isn't anything an attorney could do to you or your boyfriend considering your age.</p>
<p>On a personal note and opinion. Do not have a child anytime soon. You've got enough to deal with in the current climate, and it wouldn't be fair nor good to raise a child in the world we live in. As I wrote, that is my personal opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>Best of luck. Take care of yourself first and foremost.</p>

        <p>Paralegal and computer nerd here! Your parents can hire any attorney they want, unfortunately, you have reached the age of the majority. You are a legal adult, they have as much standing over your health as I do over my friend's dog: NONE.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it does not mean that they can not try, but normally the courts do tell people to take a hike because unless they can prove you are a public threat, the courts can not force any ruling on you without due cause or due process. Does this make sense? Next time you talk to mommy and daddy, just mentioned on the side, "yeah, I hired an attorney to sever your parental rights" and watch the fireworks commence. </p>
<p>Me, personally? I'd consult a probate court attorney and see what they say, but your parents have legal standing over you UNLESS there is a medical emergency. However, should you get married, it is your spouse that has medical legal standing and not your parents or family.</p>
<p>I highly encourage you to create what is called a "living will," have it notorized, and have it sent to your parents. This document, in case you are incapacitated for whatever reason, will dictate what you want done on your behalf should not be able to make any medical or quality of life decisions. So one of the terms of your living will could be is that you do not want to be vaccinated or but rather be treated with Ivermectin, etc. This will prevent any one from interfering with your interests as an individual who is incapacitated. </p>
<p>I highly suggest to contact an attorney if you are afraid if your parents are trying something on your behalf without your consent in the unlikely event you are incapacitated. The attorney will explain more in-depth what your rights are with a living will, and will in general or look it up on YouTube.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, one more thing! Never, ever let any one put their greasy paws on you. I don't care who they are, and how noble they think their cause is. They put their greasy paws on you, you let them know right away with a kick to the groin (men and women), punch to the throat or punch to the chest (for women). I prefer a punch to the throat, but no one has any exclusive rights or privileges over your own physical body but YOU.</p>

        <p>Your parents are shit but please don't have a baby with toyato man. Focus on becoming self reliant so you don't need your parents or him to support you in case anything goes wrong. Now is a terrible time to have a child anyway. I worry more about how this all will affect them than I do for myself. If things get really bad I am terrified for them and what I'll have to do to keep them safe. I'd rather live thru something like this without kids.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you have to do what you have to do. Don‚Äôt worry about the age gap. My boyfriend is 12 years older than me. It‚Äôs really not a big deal. 
Also, speaking from personal experience, sometimes taking space from your parents gives them the space to heal. Abusive people tend to be abusive because they themselves were abused, and their behavior is a trauma response.  Your parents may need to heal to learn to become better parents to you. 
Your life is your life. You‚Äôre in the drivers seat. The only person who has the right to judge you is you.</p>

<p>Don't get lawyers involved. Just assert your rights. If your parents start seriously harassing you you should be able to get a restraining order for free from the cops.</p>
