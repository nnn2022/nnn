        <p>It has been this way since the lockdown was implemented. It is not only Alameda County but all Bay Area counties. I object but it has like 80% support here because it has been politicized, and this area is heavily, heavily Democratic, and Democrats have decided masks are important because the current President (who I don't support at all) does not support them. And that's Science!  </p>
<p>Unsure about the legal nature of these, however.</p>

        <p>I would guess most people are doing what they think is right and good for their communities. I suspect the problem lies with who is providing them with their information and the agendas of those people. Exploiting people's good nature like that is absolutely immoral.</p>

        <p>It's not this strict in all counties. In Contra Costa I don't believe there are any travel restrictions. If so, lots of people are ignoring them. And we sure as hell don't have to wear masks outside.</p>

        <p>We are easing up finally too. Restaurants opened up today along with some retail. I went into town nearby where I live, which is a slog out into the boonies, and I found 1/3rd of the restaurants had closed down permanently, including my favorite for a decade. However, those which were open, which were maybe 1/2 of the remaining, had indoor dining and no one at all was wearing a mask, much to my surprise. Our servers were. And being in town was extremely depressing because it was otherwise weird, with movie theatre closed and a lot of retail shut or still only doing curbside delivery, and a weird clash of people who looked completely terrified and all in masks (some with whole families) walking around next to people who were completely overjoyed to be out. Also, a small homeless encampment is now in the middle of the tiny city park, which made it all stranger, especially since it was some old guys playing guitar definitely mask-free. </p>
<p>So we're hardly in a space of normalcy yet, but at least I had a drink at a nice restaurant where I could pretend things were not just a little strange (even though they had a sign saying we had to wear masks, no one at all was). It was all completely incoherent and inconsistent, which reflects peoples' very bad information here, their fears, and their beliefs in general. Of course I came home to FB posts about how we were all going to die because the restaurants opened, and my neighbor on one side told me I shouldn't have gone it as it was "unsafe" and she is waiting until next Spring and wishes everyone else would too.</p>
<p>Rural, wealthy county.</p>

        <p>These orders are being ignored by large numbers of people.   I kind of wonder what this kind if widespread law breaking by people who aren’t normally scofflaws will be.   Maybe some people will have the attitude that if I’m committing one misdemeanor, might as well ignore other laws I don’t like too.</p>
