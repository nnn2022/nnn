    <strong>If They Can Fake a Pandemic, Why Can't We?</strong>
    <p><p>It's getting to the point where I truly feel like I'm about to lose my mind. I never realized how many people were closeted insane/incapable of individualistic thought until this nightmare rolled around last March. I'll admit I was slightly concerned then since not much was known about it and all the Chinese Propaganda that was oozong out of Xi's Pooh hole seemed to paint a very grim picture; however, the rationalist who has kept their eyes above their mask must now see the truth of the scam that Covid19 is. </p>
<p>As a leukemia survivor, words cannot accurately describe the amount of frustration I bottle up on a daily basis when people who have never dealt with serious illness try and tell me about how dangerous this meme flu is. I need it to end but I've continually had to ask myself, "how does something like this actually end?" It seems plain to see for most of us here that it simply cannot.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, who's to say this insanity must continue on by their rules? Understanding that covid is continually fueled through social pressure and the rapid exchange of information and by true case numbers at this point, what is stopping us from creating our own brand new outbreak that operates based on our rules? Obviously, I don't mean a real disease, but attributing this brand new, worse than covid, novel disease to the common cold and going on the offensive - maybe it's just so dangerous that there is actually no way to even test for it, and maybe it spreads via masks, the only way to get better is to be around other people, etc. No matter what it is, the point is to use this new disease to trivialize everything about covid and showcase how insane the covid regulations have gotten by going even further into the ridiculousness - and if anyone calls you out on it you should be more than enabled at this point to call them The Science(tm) deniers and insensitive bigots per the Branch Covidian response I've received the past 12 months. I'm sick of trying to reason with the insane.</p></p>

<p>If, by incapable of individualist thought, you mean paying taxes so that experts who have dedicated their lives to epidemiology can do the thinking for me, then sure - I guess I am incapable.</p>
<p>Who made the decision for you? Facebook? Reddit?</p>

        <p>Ah, an authoritarian lunatic. Appealing to authority being your only go-to, it's no wonder you didn't understand the part of the dude's comment you graciously pasted into your own non sensical comment. Do better kiddo, just do better</p>
