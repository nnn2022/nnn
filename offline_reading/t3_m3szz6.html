    <strong>Soooooooooo</strong>
    <p><p>I understand that most of this subreddit is anti-mask, anti-lockdown etc. This has been made perfectly clear to me. I’m not trying to start a war, here. Just wondering about what got you into believing that vaccines and masks don’t work? Again, don’t want to start anything, just want to try and see things from someone else’s perspective!</p></p>

        <p>What makes you think the masks do work? Absolutely 0 data on this and studies from past years showing else wise when it comes to influenza. Locations with high compliance and mandates had no consistent better outcomes then those without, and some even had much worse. Absolutely nothing consistent to show for it. And the recent cdc “study” on the mask outcomes? The percentages of deaths and infections decreased by mask usage was so small that it was well within the margin of error for the study and no conclusion can be drawn.</p>

        <p>Well, I don't think that masks don't work. I KNOW they don't work, because I live in Italy with mask mandate for over a year now and there's still scary virus floating around apparently. As far as vaccines go, I don't know whether they work or not. I do however know that they're all experimental at this point, they don't have regular approval anywhere in the world, and so I do not believe taking them is worth the risk, and especially since they're supposed to protect me from a virus I already had without experiancing any symptoms and that even according to the WHO has merely 0.1-0.2% mortality rate.</p>

        <p>The part about vaccine manufacturers having no liability is a big red flag for me. Them trying to vaccinate the majority of the population on an emergency use authorization is also weird. The way legislators are trying to force people with the law while not complying themselves. Bill gates being involved. The fact that people trying to share opinions or facts outside the main narrative are being censored.</p>

        <p>This and the fact that if you already had covid they don’t see that as sufficiently protected. Must still get the vaccine for the thing you already had. makes me feel like theres ulterior motives.  I don’t want to be a sheep and give up my right to control what I put into my body just to placate the government since I don’t believe it’s fit my safety or others since I’ve already gotten natural immunities.</p>

        <p>There have been numerous studies that show most people who had covid have Tcells and studies that show 17 years after sars 1 98% of people still had Tcells who contracted that.  So, why should I believe an unproven vaccine over my own natural immunity?</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask to stop a virus is like wearing underwear to stop a fart. And if the vaccine works, then it shouldn't matter whether someone else has the vaccine or not. If the vaccine works, then it shouldn't matter if you wear a mask after you get it.</p>

        <p>How do I spread something I don't have? Asymptomatic spread was used to prop up the mask wearing. I hardly wore a mask I've been around tons of people and my own spouse. By this logic my spouse should have died of corona. Everyone I know that I've been around is alive. There are no bodies in the streets and I haven't been to a funeral this year. I try to live life through the lens of my own eyes not the propaganda of the media. I don't trust the government. See: tuskegee airmen experiment, holocaust, banker wars ....I can go on.</p>
<p>Or how about I took a negative covid test and still had to wear a mask on a plane everyone on the plane tested negative because they wouldn't have been able to fly otherwise. This is how I know it's a fucking joke.</p>

        <p>The one basic question people haven't been asking is "if every store and business around makes me wear masks, why do cases keep going up?" That was the first.</p>
<p>Next it was people like Fauci and the surgeon general telling us pieces of shirt and washcloths with rubber bands are good enough to protect us.</p>
<p>Then the studies came in, showing masks do hardly anything. Even the regular cloth ones. The only ones that would help are N95s, but nobody has ever enforced those.</p>
<p>And finally, the CDC has confirmed and admitted that within a 100-day period, masks only decrease chances of catching it by 1.6%.</p>
<p>No reason to wear them. At all. Whatsoever. And it is insanity to me that people are so hysterical over them.</p>

        <p>Real-world use of masks has not yielded any real-world benefit. Whether or not they theoretically have value in specially designed and controlled lab experiments doesn't matter when months of use shows that the masks that are actually being worn, the way they're being worn, do not slow or stop the spread. There's very little asymptomatic spread at all anyway. Putting low-quality masks with poor filtration on people with no symptoms to combat a virus that rarely spreads asymptomatically is just silly. Better to make genuine PPE available to vulnerable people who want it.</p>
<p>For all the time, money, and energy spent on pushing useless cloth masks, we could have paid for a lot of n95s, given more financial assistance to the most vulnerable so they can stay home, and still had some left over.</p>
<p>This vaccine in particular may or may not work. Depends on what you mean by "work." It does have side effects, which can be severe and occasionally lethal, and for some people the risk of serious side effects from the vaccines are much greater than the risk of complications of COVID. We also don't know about long term effects because the vaccine hasn't been around long enough to observe that. We don't have animal studies to help make better guesses either. But I'm not 100% against the vaccine. I'm against forcing or pressuring people to take it, and penalizing people in any way for declining it. If someone freely chooses to get it that's okay, they get to decide.</p>

        <p>Got me into, are we serious? No I never got into anything, I just think injecting poison into your body and muzzling yourself is not a good idea. Viruses are responses to pathogens in the body and there is no actual evidence of spread. Never mind the health consequences of one with all the bacteria, fibers, and mold you could inhale using one for too long the social/mental consequences are even worse. It's only breeding a culture of fear, alienation, and distrust.</p>

        <p>Most of us are not anti mask or anti vax.  We are against FORCED masks and FORCED vaxs.  People’s fragile feelings is not an excuse to force these things on everyone. If you are sick or high risk stay home.  ZERO reason for you to be out and about especially during a pandemic. </p>
<p>I wear a mask when I have to.  But I don’t wear one all day.  I don’t wear one while alone in the car. Once I leave a business the mask comes off.  I may or may not get the vaccine.  I’m just not in a rush to get it at the moment. </p>
<p>Thing is if masks truely worked why didn’t they push them years ago? Also if the pandemic was truely dangerous, NOTHING would be open.  All travel would be banned, including air and freeways.  Grocery stores won’t allow you to pick your own groceries including fruits and veggies. There would be timed limits and passes just to get food</p>

        <p>I was personally a hard pusher of masks and lockdowns for the first 6 weeks, until the data was in and it was clear that mitigation measures could be as effective as ‘lockdowns,’ while lockdowns themselves were going to kill people. If masks were shown to significantly reduce spread, I would have remained a fan. But they don’t. They reduce positive social interactions, contribute to environmental destruction (micro-plastics), cause acne and rosacea, and so on, but they don’t significantly reduce spread. You still have people attacking the supposed anti-maskers-from behind their cotton masks (known inferior to 3-ply or n95s) while out in public when they could have stayed home. I just don’t find their narrative to be credible. Those that reject NNN often push the narrative that NNN is anti-science, but please understand that I think that those pushing masks and lockdowns are anti-science and base my informed opinion off of peer-reviewed journals and whatnot, instead of fear-mongering memes and echo chambers. And BTW- I am a far left liberal. Thanks for inviting courteous dialogue. Fear has turned people into vicious creatures that too often reject courteous dialogue.</p>
