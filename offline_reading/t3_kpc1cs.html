    <strong>What to expect from the future</strong>
    <p><p>I am so scared for the future I’m having a mental breakdown right now. Like discussing future jobs, relationships &amp; things like that, but I know we won’t own anything or have any privacy, I know everyone is going to start turning against eachother and so much more. It really does feel like the end of the world. I contemplate suicide all of the time because what is the point and what will there be to live for? A life of technology, staying home, we have no idea what the vaccine is going to bring either. Not enough people are fighting to be able to make a real change. I can’t have these discussions with anyone in my life they just change the conversation topic but I am so fed up now. It is clearly only going to get worse from here.</p></p>

        <p>It is such a surreal world to live in right now. You aren’t the only one struggling - I’ve had my fair share of tears the past couple of days. I worry for the future but mostly worry about my children’s future. What world did I bring them into? It just ruins me ontop of my anxiety/depression. What helps me a little is to try to find ways to stay grounded. Have a cup of tea. Go for a walk. Hyper focus on a physical chore or hobby. Step back from social media. Just be. I’m not saying it’s easy but it lets me catch my breath a bit and to remember to stay in the present moment vs future or past. I also surround myself with people who are “woke” which aren’t many and I don’t even know them tbh we chat in fb messenger but it’s nice to know there’s sane people out there who are questioning it all as well. You seem to be in a really dark place right now and I get it. But please - it’s not worth giving up life over. Everything happens for a reason. We are going through this transition in the world in our lifetime for a reason. You need to be here. Please reach out to your family doctor (which I know is hard because big pharma..) but you don’t need to suffer through this alone.</p>

        <p>I’m right there with you but just know there are more people “waking up” and fighting against what’s happening every day - it’s just being censored by MSM. Have hope. If you give up on it all then “they” win. Here to talk to anytime :)</p>

        <p>Hey bro, first take a deep breath, there is never EVER a reason to contemplate suicide. There is always light somewhere if you look for it. </p>
<p>Where are you currently living? Take into account that even though this madness is pretty widespread, there are some regions/countries which are taking it way more relaxed than others. </p>
<p>Try looking for a remote job if that’s a possibility for you, in that way you won’t be stuck to a single location, and you won’t risk losing your job because of lockdowns. In case things are shit on your area and it feels like it’s going to take a while, move somewhere new. Be open to meeting new people, friends, there is always people friendly and open to help each other, just ask.</p>

        <p>I’ve been having gatherings with friends on their places during the whole 2020 and that kinda saved my year. Like a complete party night with booze music lights and all just between 10-15 people, it was a blast. </p>
<p>I like doing some drugs too such as LSD or MDMA and we rolled on some of these parties, just like we used to do on festivals. Some times my friends invited new friends so we kept meeting new people and I still had the occasional hook up. </p>
<p>This worked for me since partying is a hobby I enjoy and the one I would have missed the most. But I’m sure you can find ways of keeping any hobby of yours alive, even travelling. </p>
<p>Tell us more about you, do you work/study? Which area? Hobbies ? Friends?</p>

        <p>It's completely normal to be unsure and anxious in these times. But we have to realize constant fear and anxiety won't aid in anything but drive more suffering. Express yourself and your thought but don't let them consume you. </p>
<p>If you have no one to express your thoughts to in real life you're always welcome here.</p>
<p>As individuals we can cause more change than we believe. It sounds corny, but change begins internally. </p>
<p>The easiest thing that made me let go, is the fact that you can't control other people's thoughts or emotions. It's not up to me to stop someone's panic or anger, that's up to them. But I can offer my advice and opinion and they can take it or leave it.</p>

        <p>Yes I completely understand that and I thank you for your reply. The thing that caused me to think about all this was im trying to study and learn about a new job I would love to do in the future, but we don’t even know what the future will consist of anymore like what’s the point in anything if it’s only going to get worse :/ I will try to stay positive though and I hope you are too</p>

        <p>It may be in your best interest to throw everything you have into that job prospect. We don't know what's going to happen. We only know some of what they're trying to do. Worse days may not come. They may (be forced to) give up and try again far into the future. And they may fail then as well. We just don't 100% know where this is headed. May as well try and better ourselves as best we can❤️</p>
<p>I let my home go completely starting in March. I worried and drank/ate myself into weight gain. I was so fit😔 I got ahold to myself, but then I had paid time off, then my birthday, and then Christmas. So I just let 2020 go completely. But somehow I decided to be different this year. I spent the last two days happily getting my home in order. I took care of things I was going to ignore because I plan on moving in a couple years. I decided to take care of them anyway and looking around at all I've accomplished just  makes me proud. I've also traded my daily coffee (with alcohol) habit that I picked up this year. Juice and fruit will be replacing it. I have lots of little things I plan to do to make myself healthier and happier this year, even if the outside world continues to be insane. I chose to worry about what I can control. </p>
<p>Best of luck to you! I had those feelings as well. I decided to live in the now and not worry about the past or future. I know it isn't easy.</p>

        <p>One very important thing about policymakers: they don't have a clue what they're doing.</p>
<p>Seriously, they're so far removed from how ordinary people think and act that they're using big data to try and catch up, but big data can't capture the zeitgeist so it doesn't tell them what will happen, only what <em>should</em> happen (which is guaranteed to be wrong at some point, more and more the more they push into unprecedented scenarios). They're likely just as stunned as we are that things got this far.</p>

        <p>You are so not alone. This year was hard enough and I lost so many people just due to personal issues, political views, and for refusing to live in fear. My circle constantly is down sizing. I need therapy for the personal stuff, but I know so much of my anxiety and stress is due to my non-essential current career and for fear of the future, and I’m afraid of telling some poor therapist about all these “crazy conspiracies” about fake news and Covid camps. </p>
<p>I’m glad there are people like you here to keep me in reality that I haven’t completely lost it. This is an insane time to try to figure out the truth and find purpose and meaning. We just gotta keep going every day and fight the good fight. ❤️</p>
