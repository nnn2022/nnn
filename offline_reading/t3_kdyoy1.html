    <strong>Something You Can Do Right Now: Help me to Select and Popularize a Symbol</strong>
    <p><p>We all know it, the main drivers of the collective insanity that we are now undergoing are the very dishonorable deficiencies of: unquestioning deference to authority, virtue signalling and fear fueled herd mentality. Those of us who spend so much of our time here on /r/nonewnormal would all like to do something about this.</p>
<p>But what can be done? Some of us here organize and attend protests or engage in civil disobedience. This is a good thing and it is important that you continue to do this, but it seems that we just don't (yet) have the large numbers and support needed to make this work. Maybe our numbers will grow on their own as things get worse, maybe not. But I for one do not want to wait for another two weeks to flatten the curve, a jab in the arm at gunpoint, or a complete economic collapse. </p>
<p>So, I had a think, what is the easiest thing that we can do to start to turn the tide? The problems that I mentioned at the top of this post all have one thing in common: people believe that society is more or less unified on the question of covid. In order to challenge that we can employ a technique that is used by all social animals to one degree or another and that technique is <em>signaling</em>. This is the very same sort of signal which is meant in the term "virtue signalling" and its purpose is to advertise a quality in the signaler which would elicit some response in the signalee. For instance, you might signal that you are in need of help by screaming, or signal your intelligence by using big words. Now, if we want to challenge the notion that we all believe the main-stream narrative on covid then what we need to do is send a signal, that this just isn't so.</p>
<p>A symbol is a useful form of signal which people can easily adopt and display themselves and so that's what we need to make. If our opponents see a large amount of people (a sizeable minority is enough) all adopting and wearing a symbol which signals our support for an immediate return to normalcy, their mindsets will completely say. Additionally this will bolster the confidence of our own side, emboldening us to conduct the sort of demonstrations and civil disobedience which will be necessary to force all the would-be tyrants to back down.</p>
<p>So here is where you come in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Come up with a symbol that can be worn on your person (it is important that it is wearable so as to illicit the sort of primitive response that humans have when they notice <em>signals</em> in the people around them).</li>
<li>Consider the pros and cons of your symbol including things such as the logistics of how people could adopt your symbol on a large scale, the symbol's visibility, social acceptability and intrinsic meaning.</li>
<li>Make a post with a title in this format <strong>Symbol Suggestion: &lt;brief description of your symbol here&rt;</strong>.</li>
<li>If you decide to make a text post, explain your symbol and give an explanation of its advantages and (optionally) disadvantages relative to other possible symbols. If you decide to post an image to showcase your symbol, then make the same explanation in a comment on your post.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that this does not have to be something complicated (and in fact complexity is a barrier to adoption) so serious art or craft skills are not (necessarily) required. </p>
<p>After a few symbol suggestions begin to make it to the top of nonewnormal I will make a post listing the popular ones so that we can debate which symbols we like and then put it to a democratic vote which symbol we want to popularize (also feel free to PM directly to bring my attention to a symbol). From there, we will contact some of the big social media influencers who are on our side to ask them to help us to start a campaign to get the word out about our chosen symbol. </p>
<p>If this manages to take off and there are enough popular suggestions in time I will make a post to summarize the symbol suggestions this Saturday at 01:00:00 UTC. If this doesn't take off I may need to wait, or drop the idea altogether.</p>
<p>Let's see if we can do this. Let's see if we can really do something so simple which could change the world.</p></p>

        <p>I think a face mask under the nose would be a great symbol for us to have, especially if it's drawn not completely over the mouth, either. I saw someone wearing one over just their bottom lip the other day, LOL. That would drive Doomers crazy.</p>

        <p>Not wearing a facemask is something that alot of us already do and already push other people to do, self included, but outside of a few rural places where it found a critical mass, this hasn't really taken off. So I doubt that there's any simple way to convince people to do this now if they aren't already.</p>
<p>Purposely wearing a mask in a particular way could be a thing though. Like wearing the mask the wrong way out maybe. I'll admit that I don't think that I'd vote for this because because I think that there are too many people who would be too scared to do something this brazen.  But it has its merits.</p>

        <p>No mask and a warm smile. My “civil disobedience” is smiling kindly to strangers and being nothing but sweet when asked to put a mask on. A few weeks ago I had to travel for work (masks are mandatory on planes but other than that cases are low and life is normal) and when asked about my mask on the plane I respectfully declined and then I wasn’t asked again. The woman next to me took her mask off to eat and started talking to me about how annoying they were and then kept it off</p>

        <p>Being sweet and kind is a very good idea. Fear catches but so does its opposite. Laughter evolved as a way for tribal humans to quickly communicate the discovery of an absence of danger after being subtly startled by a sudden noise or other nasty surprise. You go out and be sweet and kind and you are communicating that you are not afraid and that they shouldn't be either. </p>
<p>It's very good but not the kind of signal I'm looking for. I'd like something that anybody can adopt easily even if they are not the sort of person who feels brave enough to go out without a mask or are congenial enough to be so warm with people. Of course ideally it would be better if they could.</p>

        <p>People that are going to take the mask off have done so already. I don't accept that there isn't something else that could work.  To serve as a good signal, just need something with these qualities: highly visible, recognizable, available. Bare face does all that but many people are too afraid.</p>
