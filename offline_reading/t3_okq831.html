    <strong>Why attack the most complaint and leave us behind?</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry if this has been asked, I've never seen a reasonable response and looking to better understand. </p>
<p>If the vax will kill or harm the consumers and the only healthy ones left are basically dissidents- why does that benefit the world leaders? Why would they want to kill or harm the most compliant people?</p></p>

        <p>I don't necessarily buy into the theory that the intent is injure or kill.  They'd have to care in a fashion for that to be.  They clearly don't.</p>
<p>One possible goal is instituting and normalizing a sort of medical tyranny by forcing compliance.  For all we know many of the injections could be a placebo- though adverse reactions does contradict that.</p>

        <p>Nor do I but nevertheless, side effects do seem to be showing in even the most devout followers so placebo side effects seem to be unlikely. </p>
<p>It could just be generalised anxiety for the most part as well, I went through most of the symptoms of post vax a couple of years ago after a long fight with sudden anxiety. Chest pains, random headaches and much more.</p>

        <p>True.</p>
<p>The central fact seems to be that we're not being dealt with honestly so we're left to construct our own theories... many of which are "deliciously out there" to the mainstream propagandists at the ready to discredit skepticism.</p>

        <p>The obvious lack of truth of transparency is a concern for me. The huge rush to hit the goal before X time as well seems a little off. I've been holding off getting the Jab, I'd be getting the Pfizer as I'm 30+ and UK based, no interest in it until it at least benefits me in some way, those benefits will sadly be my freedom to live..</p>

        <p>I actually took the injections as I'm nearing 60 and would prefer to have fewer things to attend should I find myself in urgent need of medical services because of my age.  My stance isn't knee-jerk against the shots but if I were a decade younger I'd have held off.</p>
<p>I participate in the sub for numerous reasons- not the least being that I support people's right to choose for themselves.  The trickery, bribes, and transparent BS being employed reeks of attempting to trick people which doesn't smell right to me and at times has me questioning my own decision.</p>

        <p>I am a believer of giving the right medication to those who need it. If the vaccine is legit then great, give it to the people who need it most. This is best case scenario. </p>
<p>I will take the jab eventually unless we see a global change of attitudes I'm too young to not be able to continue participating in life, being right doesn't pay the mortgage and just like all the other scares I believe this isn't the last problem we'll face as collective of skeptics.</p>

        <p>In general yes, for me, no. I'll be mortgage free around 7 years from the start date as long as I can continue to work. </p>
<p>Paying someone else's mortgage through renting makes a lot less sense and living in a box on the street is out of the question for me!</p>

        <p>I guess so, as long as they provide a cushion, otherwise what's the point? </p>
<p>Trad life is not a great life, it's actually a whole lot of hard work just to survive with a high failure rate and honestly most people who say they can just go out and farm and live in a wooden hut without preexisting experience of living that way are delusional.</p>

        <p>Yes it is in theory, but in practice this way of like is still an incredibly hard task to achieve and not one to take so flippantly. </p>
<p>Given the choice of literal servitude or try and stick it out in the woods I'd go for the latter but if it was a similar amount of servitude as we experience today I'd probably just carry on as normal. </p>
<p>If you want a hard life, no one is stopping you right now but since you are here on Reddit and not working the land or building a wood cabin I'll take it that you understand what I'm getting at.</p>

        <p>I think with all human endeavours… the vaccine had good intentions… this technology has been in the works for 10 to 20 years however it lacks any long term data on human beings. Could it be that we as humans are over confident? That the most enlightened geneticists and scientists overlooked some variables… or do we have so much faith in our abilities to never question ourselves? </p>
<p>On the other hand the more extreme conspiracy would be a population and eugenics program to cull populations with varied death statistics over the next 10 years to coincide with climate change catastrophe… since we’re in the most critical 10 to 15 years to reverse climate change impacts EI mass migrations from inhabitable zones and conflict over dwindling resources… much more far fetched but something to ponder non the less in a corportrocracy led western existence…</p>

        <p>This is something I realized some time ago. I perceive an over confidence in science. It doesn't mean I say it's wrong to appreciate it, I say that over confidence means arrogance, and arrogance can lead to disasters. Those who blindly claims that mrna vaccines are safe on the long term without any experimental evidence are not scientists, they are scientologists. Probably nothing will happen, but in the remote possibly it will, it will be a hecatomb.</p>

        <p>It's about bringing all the compliant ones under the digital ID/Social Credit system under the pretense of public health. The vax isn't going to drastically reduce population, just add to the ever increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that pharma makes so much money off of. With the added bonus of keeping the populace weak both mentally and physically.</p>

        <p>This is by far the most believable outcome. </p>
<p>Following on from the recent online racism after England lost the football match, it didn't take long for huge petitions demanding social media links your real ID to your online persona. This is probably the first step of that plan. </p>
<p>I always thought the UK lagged behind on that agenda, still don't even need to provide ID to obtain a sim card which is unusual compared to a lot of the world today!</p>

        <p>If you lead all command and control and authority that makes the entire system work, including finance, why do you think they care if those left behind are resistant? If the theory that these are to kill is true, then this is just vector one of a multifaceted attack over a long time. The unified positions from completely seperate governments shows whatever it turns out to be, it's been planned down to the letter for years imo.</p>

        <p>I'm no expert, but your question is what led me to believe that this is largely about money, politics, or control, rather than wiping out large numbers of people. That said, I'm not foolish enough to completely disregard the comments on some world leaders and billionaires on population control.</p>
<p>I started to look around locally and ask people in my church, at work, and get a sense with local online marketplaces on whose vaccinated and whose not. I didn't do that because I wanted to berate people and I dropped it if anyone was offended or not interested. Nevertheless, locally, the vast majority of people unvaccinated are not only the most heavily armed, but very few gun owners in our area seem to be vaccinated. I've been chatting with a few guys online throughout North America who have found the same true.</p>
<p>So, why would the vax be used for population control if the majority of people who are left are armed? The Sheep (as they are often called) who willingly took vaccines no-questions-asked are largely urban consumers who will do what they are told and spend their valuable time, labor, and money at their own expense. I would think, the powerful elites would only want these people around or at least to continue to suck them dry.</p>
<p>All of that said, it still doesn't change the fact that the vaccines have not been tested long-term and that people will have negative reactions both short and long-term. Couldn't it be that pharmaceutical companies and those that have vested interests in them orchestrated the global reaction to this pandemic (or created it) purely for financial profit? That is after all their goal to make money. Many helpful and lifesaving pharmaceuticals have been developed, but they don't do it for free.</p>

        <p>You know, I was just asking the same thing.  What is the long game?  I believe it has something to do with maybe some or all of these</p>
<p>1)testing the compliance of people- how much control do we have over people
2) testing of facial recognition cameras, even with masks on ( I saw an early report from Russia on this...somewhere)
3) Possible set up to a debt reset
4) something like swine flu ( at one point, even wiki made mention that a leading WHO person stated it was the biggest hoax ever)
5) Population control of older people - do the math on social security benefits
6) Playing americans off against each other - This is the big one to me, they want is fighting with each other so much - we don't see what's going on or coming.</p>

In fact, they’ll see it as sport. They’ll probably have Elite hunting parties, and they come in to our ghettos with their hounds, whilst on horseback themselves, and hunt us down like foxes on a jolly hunt.

        <p>But in line with the 'indiscriminate/ random kill shot" theory, their numbers will dwindle also, right? Yes there will be less people to control but the percentage doesn't shift with it, should surely go the other way once everyone has lost someone due to government sponsored killing?</p>

        <p>Agreed. This is how they manufacture change and make it stick. It's the 'boiling of the frog' metaphor.

        <p>Very good u not in city., this is the best place to be currently and the next few years.</p>
<p>Written about the city to inspire folks who are in the city to leave it if they can.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm aware there will be a time when they will try to come also after the land guys. Maybe not how we expect it.  Why do I say this?</p>
<p>There are many things in this equation. I don't know if you are aware of the "ufo" subject, but that's something  very related to this "great reset"/covid scenario.</p>
<p>Why do I say this? Well, it's about technology. Those things run on a different type of tech that will make petrol and nuclear unnecessary... Maybe this will answer part of the question you were asking in the title.</p>
<p>So if we introduce this in the equation, this explain why it's possible that we still "have a few years ahead" until it will happen what u were talking about, and even then we are not sure what could change.</p>
<p>For example, I didn't expected Greece to rise so promptly, and this will change the whole vax passport scenario. Or at least will delay it.</p>

        <p>I think it’s about making mandatory incarcerations “normal” if you don’t know the govts. Are building mass quarantine centers and have hinted that they will do door to door health checks… this could be paired with surveillance to have an excuse to disappear any political opposition… in short vaccination deaths are not the primary objective they are just  cannon fodder.</p>

        <p>All those theories about the injections are here to wipe out huge numbers of humanity are having a huge flaw. Why should anybody want to reduce the weatern civilization? The western world has been the most proficient innovative and productive for over a century by now. China is on the rise thats true but their products have not the same quality just before somebody puts in that my statement is false. Hence it does not make sense to begin in our areas to reduce population. Especially not when lots of the needed ressources come out of africa and arabia. </p>
<p>But what makes sense is to produce vaccines under a so called pandemic situation where the broad public buys in to the 'threat' which results in having some side effects to healthy people. Those side effects like the blood clotting are good for the pharma industry as when you are in danger to get blood clots and possibly can die from that most people will of course buy blood conditioning meds to prevent from getting it. Another fact that speaks for this is that the pharma industry will not be held responsible for those side effects as there is an emergency license for those vaccines. So this all might be a plot to produce future customers that depend on your products to stay alive or at least have a normal life quality. </p>
<p>Another thing that makes this scenario plausible is that at least over here in europe there was a trend in the last 20 years towards alternative medicine that was more on the preventional approach of avoiding getting sick instead of taking meds to reduce symptomatics. In the long run that means the people will be less sick or affected by deseases and the income of pharmaceutical products will drop in a significant manner. So the best strategy to have a stable income is to create a situation where people depend on your products. The rest on the political side what happened are just side effects.

        <p>It doesn't matter if you are compliant or not - the financial reset will get everyone, and I think that those who subject themselves to these medical experiments are simply in line to either be harmed by them or be controlled when they are inevitably brought over to a UBI provided by the gov via a CBDC.</p>
<p>There is a silent financial revolution well under way. I don't think most people are paying attention to it. GET SOME BTC.</p>

        <p>&rt;If the vax will kill or harm the consumers</p>
<p>Statistically speaking it doesn't. This is a strawman argument.</p>
<p>&rt;Why would they want to kill or harm the most compliant people?</p>
<p>There is a big difference between kill and harm.</p>
<p>Harming the most compliant is what helps keep them so compliant. The more they are harmed, and the more they blame the dissidents for the harm when it is actually the government harming them, the more compliant they become.</p>
<p>This is basic military boot camp stuff. Make the entire platoon do pushups because one guy fucked up, so they give that one guy shit privately and "whip him into shape".</p>
<p>The "They are trying to kill us all" nonsense is kind of like the government trying to blame the dissidents. It's an intentional misdirection.</p>

        <p>This is a really good question.</p>
<p>The government expect that after the “Great Reset”, the economy will be so much more efficient/prosperous that hardly anyone will complain.</p>
<p>They anticipate that their post lockdown world will be cushy enough to quell dissent.</p>

        <p>If we had recently just passed the horizon of full scale autonomous means of production I'd be onboard with that line of thought, but right now we haven't achieved that fully and so in reality with less people we may lose those who are necessary to provide the cushy ride post Great Reset™.</p>

        <p>A theory that is floated often in my circles is that the vaccine is actually for some kind of biological weapon that is already released or will be released in the future. This is not outside the realms of possibility and in that situation we were technically right about Covid but also not protected against what they were too afraid to tell us earlier.</p>

        <p>I do believe there are psyops at play , but  opportunistic in nature. </p>
<p>False reporting of successful lockdowns in Wuhan/China, producing faulty models of pandemic spread, rushing vaccines to capitalize, remarkable absence of cases in some countries, lab leak theory, faulty PCR test, media exaggerating with pictures of pyres, Ellis Island etc... All of these things can be explained by human factors, related to pride, dishonesty and greed, without need of a grand conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>This pandemic exists in the mind of middle class midwits, it is they that work in the sciences, it is they that work in social media, it is they that consume this content. </p>
<p>I don't believe there's some grand plan, but a series of shit decision and rampant corruption in science, big business and politics slowing the emergence of the truth.</p>

        <p>Its really simple. Optics. Create a class that can be demonized (dissidence) they sus themselves out by refusing the vax. Blame them for the next wave. Label them a health risk to the population strongly supported by those who have taken the vax. Queue the quarantine camps to round up the dissidence. You have now isolated the dissidence from general population. Now you can kill them with "outbreaks" at the quarantine camps and no one will be left to question the narrative. </p>
<p>If you are having trouble understanding this take a look at any genocide in history. Nazi germany 1919 - 33 nazi parties rise to power is exactly what is happening right now. We are at the demonize stage and its moving at an accelerated rate as this pandemic and the adverse reactions are going to be blamed on the unvaxed. As the deaths start to pile up you're going to see more and more rhetoric about how un vaxed should be punished and something needs to be done about it... Welcome to the new world order.</p>
