    <strong>Does USA health insurance cover covid vaccine injury?</strong>
    <p><p>I  have been trying to figure out if normal USA health insurance covers covid  vaccine injury.  Because a lot of insurance does NOT cover experimental  not FDA approved treatments so there is room for question there.  The  closest I have found is someone asked the same question and an insurance  'clarified' that they cover side effects from all 'approved' vaccines,  which is clear as mud since covid vaccines are not approved yet.</p>
<p>Google  efforts also yielded the following info, usually covid sickness itself  and the cost of the vaccine is covered.  If your employer mandates you  get the vax, then any injury will LIKELY be covered either by worker's  compensation insurance or you could sue your workplace.  Getting the  vaccine does not affect your life insurance plan payouts or any such.   It sounds like health insurance would still cover you if you were in any  approved vaccine trial (not 100% on that though but that's what they  are implying).  You could argue this whole thing IS a vaccine trial but I am not sure if insurance is counting it that way or not, usually trials are small and would not effect expenses to insurance greatly, vs something so global that everyone is getting it that also has a higher than normal level of side effects.  As we know, you can't sue vaccine makers though, they  have immunity.  And yes there is a small vaccine injury type govt system  you can apply to but damages are capped and they only approve a small  portion of applicants.</p>
<p>What I  can't find is info about if you take the vax and are not considered to be in an approved trial and  said vax is experimental (as all the covid pokes currently are), and you  get a nasty reaction, will your insurance cover that in the same was as  if you got the virus itself, or would you be denied due it being  experimental?  One reason I ask is there is a rumor mill story going  around that one person was denied by his insurance for covering his vaccine side effects treatment.  And of course this could vary by type of insurance, apparently very much older 'legacy' insurance plans are exempt from some newer rules as well.  But I am wondering if people planning to get the vax should be checking with their insurance on this or if anyone has heard anything.</p></p>

        <p>You need to read your insurance policy. Remember, the goal of any health insurance company is to do as little as possible for YOU. </p>
<p>If you are injured because of the experimental medical treatment, and you make your claim. Now keep in mind, they will make every attempt to NOT help you, and even you bring it up the U.S. general government, they also will make every attempt to NOT help you. Mysteriously, they will blame other factors and not the elephant in the room. In other words, you're screwed because the system is set up to not help you.</p>

        <p>Most insurance policies were written pre covid so it's probably not going to be clear.  I am seeing conflicting things, some say you are covered if you are in approved medical trials but also saying they do not cover 'experimental drugs' as a general rule, assumedly that is for non trials though.  People being in approved trials is usually rare and life threatening outcomes are probably even more rare since drugs USUALLY have to go through long safety trials before they even get to humans, so any side effects are likely to be rare and overall not make a dent in the bottom line of an insurance company.   But this current situation with a mass roll out of an experimental drug that has a lot of side effects is quite different and potentially could boost costs to insurance companies a lot.</p>

        <p>If your health insurance denies treatment for anything caused by the vaccine, then you should file a claim with the U.S. government. If it was caused by the vaccine, then the government has to pay. Of course, the government will simply say it wasn't caused by the vaccine, and you'll be up a creek.</p>

<p>Yep, that's exactly what happens much of the time.  It's pretty hard to 100 percent prove many of these reactions were caused by the vaccine, even if they happened 2 seconds after you get it, it COULD still be a coincidence, granted a super super super unlikely coincidence of course, but the govt decides using algorithms that are convenient for them, not for you.</p>

        <p>From what I have read, life insurance has said that the shots do not affect life insurance because you can be in an experimental trials for meds in general without that affecting your life insurance.  At this point, there's probably not enough data to know who all this will or will not affect life expectancy anyway.  If they figure some of that out down the road and it becomes significant enough to make a big difference in their bottom line, they might consider it though in the future.</p>
