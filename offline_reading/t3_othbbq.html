    <strong>Does police and stores etc. really annoy you with masks and vaxx that much in your country?</strong>
    <p><p>I am just curious. In US, UK does police and other people really annoy you to wear maska and get the vaxx? </p>
<p>We got the Biontech-Pfizer one in Turkey. But most people had Sinovac, the chinese vax. Because we didnt have biontech before. For example, media tells mask up bla bla and vaxx, but none really cares. I had a week of vacation without a mask. And mind you it was terribly crowded everywhere, all along Mediterranean sea, all hotels were damn full. Most of the people doesn't wear mask.</p>
<p>So in vacation, none said anything. I even went there without a mask. They know it's nuts. Police don't care. Stores, bars cafes don't care. Some stupid little stores do care. Fuk em.</p>
<p>What would happen if they tried forced vaxx? We simply wouldn't oblige I think. Many people are unvaxxed. Our economy kinda sucks nowadays so I don't think they'll force it. He would terribly lose in the election. Greece has worse economy but they enforced vaxx and masks as I see it.</p></p>

        <p>I live 5 blocks from the White House and it’s been normal for about 2 months. Before that, everyone was a complete nazi about it, and I’d put $10k on it that starting next Monday they’re gonna be nazis about it again.</p>

        <p>I guess it depends on where in the US. I live in Georgia, and a pretty rural, suburban at absolute most, area where people either wear one or dont without much bickering. If I were to go to Atlanta for whatever reason, probably be a different story just because it’s a more dense area. I doubt police would pose a problem even there, aside from asking me once to put one on or leave the premises because they got a call about me and don’t want anything to escalate. Day-to-day, though, no one really cares</p>
