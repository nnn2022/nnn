    <strong>Gotta love that Texas is not having a surge in new covid cases after abolishing their mask mandate, despite doomers being positive a "new surge" was impending...</strong>
    <p><p>It has already been roughly two weeks or so since the mandate has lifted, yet, absolutely no spike has taken place, and currently in Texas new cases are trending downward.</p>
<p>Its almost as if 20% of the population consisting of the most at risk groups taking a dose of the vaccine makes a difference, and we should start easing up restrictions, since the situation has changed...</p>
<p>Guess the doomers just want everything to just stay locked down forever regardless of the facts.</p></p>
