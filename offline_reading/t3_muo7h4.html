    <strong>If they can just write you off with Covid death for having it in your body whos to say thwy arent doing the aame thing with the vaccine causing it?</strong>
    <p><p>Here's what is still up in the air but we know it's happening.</p>
<p>We know people were dying both from Covid and by other means. Two we know the flu didn't just go away from the guidelines. Makes you wonder if Covid is covering up the fact that maybe it's the Flu that's been mutated so much that it's made current Flu shots pretty much non effective. Of course they don't want the public to know that right? So what better way to hide that from us by coming out with a new virus for everyone to focus on. </p>
<p>Think I'm being far-fetched? Explain why then that everyday for the past year now they have felt the need to continue telling us Covid isn't safe? The Flu didn't just go away if Covid can continue to increase in cases like it's the only virus that's the exception to the guidelines.</p>
<p>Tltr: They are hiding the fact the Flu has gotten more deadly and using Covid to cover it up so people will continue to get the Flu shot and trust vaccines.</p></p>

        <p>I’m not sure I’m with you on all of this but I guarantee that they will blame a lot of vaccine deaths on covid.  The variants decrease the “efficacy”, breakthrough cases, whatever.</p>

        <p>Flu has always gone through cycles, the 1967-68 season was a particularly bad one.</p>
