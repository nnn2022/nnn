    <strong>Home for the holidaze</strong>
    <p><p>Real talk: is anyone else dreading seeing their Biden-loving family this holiday season?</p>
<p>I’m in a blue state hellhole and seeing my red state Biden-supporting friends and family is presenting a major challenge to me. </p>
<p>They seriously don’t get it and they don’t care to look harder. They are happy with their TDS and their msnbc fear porn. </p>
<p>These are people who love me and don’t necessarily want to lecture me about anything, but privately and quietly think Covid is a big fucking deal and think that their red state should usurp more or their freedoms and that Biden and Fauci are going to lead us out of the darkness.</p>
<p>I can’t bear the thoughts of even seeing their faces right now. Much less holding up civil conversation. I feel so forlorn and isolated. I’m trying to get over it. It’s just hard.</p>
<p>Tips? Meditation? Hypnosis? Xanax? Help!</p></p>

        <p>Avoid discussions on politics ... that's been an unspoken rule for family gatherings for a millennia. Don't forget that they're family and you were a family before Trump/Biden and will still be a family after Trump/Biden. Keep your chin up, we will get through this. </p>
<p>Also seeing as your someone who is seeing the bigger picture the most you can do is prepare for it, keep your family in mind for your preps, saying "I told you so" would be satisfying yes .. but not productive or helpful. </p>
<p>Enjoy your time with family before that right ... cough* cough* I mean luxury is taken from all of us.</p>

        <p>Well, I am in India and my parents are in California so I will not be seeing them for the holidays. However, we FaceTime every week and yesterday got in a screaming match with them. It was ugly. All I did was say that the election did seem irregular and I was met with a tirade of emotion and screaming "fake news." I lost my cool after that and we were off to the races. It peaked with me yelling that I was sick of being called a racist nazi for daring to question all sides of the political spectrum. They know I've identified as more or less as anarchist or libertarian for years, yet they are shouting at me to bend the knee for Biden. I couldn't take it anymore. </p>
<p>Anyway, after my outburst my dad and I continued the convo and actually had decent chat about why I don't believe in lockdowns and will not be taking the vaccine. My mom had run off hysterically by that point and we still haven't talked.</p>
<p>So yeah, I tried to be calm and conscious going into it but the kettle boiled over. The good news was it ended well between my dad and me and we acknowledged that family is more important than politics.</p>

        <p>That’s inspiring. There’s hope! </p>
<p>My dad basically called me a racist or racist-supporter for voting trump (I’ve always been a liberal). But I said we can agree to disagree.</p>
<p>It’s me who is still here holding the grudge. I find myself wanting to text links to articles to my family about suicides and poverty caused by lockdowns, and say ANSWER FOR THIS. ANSWER FOR VOTING FOR A CANDIDATE WHO SUPPORTS THIS.</p>
<p>That’s not on them, that’s on me. I’m not the victim, I’m the perp (in my own mind - I don’t lash out in real life - yet). And I don’t know what to do about it.</p>
<p>I’m seriously considering hypnosis so that when I see my family, I don’t jump immediately to anger, but can take a breath and remember my feelings foe them before covid.</p>
<p>right now I don’t have access to that of calm and deliberative thinking, and I hate myself for it</p>

        <p>Are they even going to be gathering in person for the holidays?  I don't think mine are.  If they do, and you can, avoid political topics- change the topic by verbal force if you have to.  Remember that these people are your family, and will continue to be once this insanity ends.  </p>

        <p>I’m just trying to believe that this WILL ever end. It feels like it won’t.</p>
<p>I’m trying not to personally blame them for being blind media-eating sheep. But my anger wells up so easily. I would just love to chat with a therapist about this, because I don’t want to have no family - I think that’s a terrible idea - but I am struggling to contain my emotions, in a big way.</p>

        <p>That means a lot to me that you mention that. I was too young to be a part of that aftermath but in hindsight I bet it was hellacious to endure if you weren’t pounding the drum of war and censorship, because most were. </p>

        <p>Yes! Because they have no idea what it’s really like out here in lockdown hysteria hell. And they hear what they want to hear.</p>
<p>They are freaking red state wannabe liberals. Living free fucking lives thanks to their sane governor, thinking people bleating against Biden and Fauci (me) are just off-the-rails crybabies... but they think family and friends can’t spread covid, only strangers at the grocery store can and that’s why we need a mask mandate.</p>
<p>I’m so lonely at this point I just wish I’d never been born. I’m so so so lonely. My very best friend, more accurately my sister (from another mister) falls into this category and my heart is broken into about one million pieces over it.</p>

        <p>This whole “strangers spread covid but not people you know” is extremely isolating and makes it an us vs. then mentality. It also assumes you have friends and family to see. What if you just moved somewhere new and you know not a soul? How are you supposed to meet new people if you are automatically excluded from groups of friends? It’s like when you’re in high school and everyone is part of a clique and you have to eat your lunch in the library alone. It’s cruel.</p>
<p>But my advice would be to make emotional arguments when they say something. Facts and figures don’t matter when people say, “but people are dying!!” Talk about how poor people will starve. How children are being abused and denied an education, leading to them not being able to function in society later on. How people are committing suicide and suffering from overdoses because they have nothing to live for and support systems like AA meetings are on zoom and ineffective.</p>
<p>It’s arguments like that that help flip the switch. Because you are forcing them to see their privilege and selfishness for what it is — that they fear their own mortality and that’s the only reason why they care. THEY are afraid of dying — they don’t care about other people.</p>

        <p>I agree, and also it’s not true. Covid IS spread in families. I imagine it’s spread MOSTLY in families. They knew they could get people to turn against strangers and get hysterical about strangers but not their own families. So they spun their hysteric lies in that direction to divide us. But it’s been spreading in families this whole freaking time (to which I reply: omg who cares, we NEED our families). </p>
<p>And you’re right, it’s disregarding the lives of single people. And new to town people. I shudder to think of previously mentally healthy young people driven to despair and self harm from the isolation. I’ve always had depression, it was always in the cards for me and I’m okay with that, but for people who had no history of it, to be plunged into its wretched depths... god dammit. Depression is a beast and launching a population into it without benefit is unconscionable.</p>

        <p>It is all about fear. People who act out of fear cannot act morally. Many who have beliefs such as those you have described don’t think there is anything beyond the life they are currently living. If there is nothing beyond this life, the only things they can do to be good people are to preserve their own lives for as long as possible and give in to the secular religion of politics. Otherwise, what is the point of it all—so far as they are concerned?</p>

        <p>Very very true. My family and friends are atheists and I think that has quite a lot to do with it. I’m an atheist as well but just have a very different take on things, obviously. I’m more in the “life is fleeting and we should live joyously while we can” camp. We are seriously all going to die way sooner then we think. That’s why I find all this so tragic.</p>

        <p>I hear you. My conclusions are from my family, who act largely the same way. It’s a very specific set of neuroses around sickness and death.</p>
