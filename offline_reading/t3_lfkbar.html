        <p>You do know that she was hired to run their medical website, right? That she has some medical training, right?</p>
<p>I think that Florida has the right tack on CoVid-19 but this lady did expose that Florida was trying to hide some facts and that I applaud her for.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t trust a geologist major to know health statistics. </p>
<p>Also have you taken a look at her statistics ? I haven’t but I’m sure you have, if you care to show them maybe we could see how legit they are</p>

        <p>The group of people who foam at the mouth in celebration of Assange's persecution want to define who and what a "whistleblower" is... lol.</p>
<p>I think in all the partisan sport, the truth is somewhere in the middle... bureaucrats obviously manipulate data for short term political interests. And grifters gonna grift. It's Spiderman vs Spiderman.</p>
<p>Except this girl has serious issues and if there are issues with DeSantis' leadership, then she only discredits real claims. These are the consequences of a failed media state- when you elevate and reward people like this, people can get seriously hurt. She should have turned her data (if it existed) over to an entity like Wikileaks or a transparency media organization, if they still exist... Obama is more to blame for establishment institutional illegitimacy than Trump.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Fortune named her to its 40 Under 40. Forbes awarded her “Technology Person of the Year” for “step[ping] up to fill the vacuum left by governments during COVID-19.”</strong> She’s started another lucrative GoFundMe [$302,223] to “defend science.”</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>NPR describes Jones as a “top scientist” leading Florida’s pandemic response.</strong> In fact, Jones has held three jobs in her field; all three have ended in her being terminated and criminally charged.</p>
<p>&rt;Since her termination from the DoH, Jones has doubled down on her criticism of prominent epidemiologists—and in doing so, she has revealed serious gaps in her own knowledge of COVID-19. In July, Jones asserted that false negative antibody tests are “worrisome” because “you’re not aware that you have and can spread the virus.” Dr. Natalie Dean, an infectious disease expert, explained that false negative antibody tests carry no public health risk, but false negative antigen tests do. (Antibody tests show past infection, while antigen tests detect active infections that can be spread). <strong>Instead of admitting her mistake, Jones blocked Dr. Dean and contacted the epidemiologist’s employer to complain. Yet even after this incident, the Washington Post referred to Jones as a “COVID-19 data scientist.”</strong></p>
<p>Contempt for fact-checkers and honesty. Hail yourself as a scientific truthteller in the fight for health human rights and report misinformation that could get people hurt? What do you do, issue a retraction/correction and apologize? Nah, just block, report, try to get them fired, laugh, move on. She fits <em>right in</em> with the establishment. </p>
<p>&rt;Today, Jones awaits trial at her new home in an upmarket DC suburb. She invested part of her crowdfunding proceeds in a for-profit corporation, Florida COVID Action LLC. Its website states: “Reporting data fairly, completely and transparently is of the upmost [sic] importance.” Jones vows to campaign for DeSantis’ 2022 Democratic challenger. “If I could have run for office in Florida and not have to worry about my family’s safety, I absolutely would have,” she Tweeted. “But the governor would never let that happen.” She says she’s using donors’ funds “to fight DeSantis, and anything else he throws at me.”</p>
<p>Trump is not an aberration.</p>
