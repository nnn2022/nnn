    <strong>Employers are helping to manufacture faked consent and uniformity of thought</strong>
    <p><p>So this is what’s currently going on in Indiana….   <br>
At the moment, they aren’t yet forcing vaccines, or demanding vaccination cards (probably because they’re easily faked) and they aren’t demanding medical information from you (because that’s a hipaa violation). Instead they are asking people to willingly “volunteer” their vaccine status and if they SAY they’ve got the shot, they can be maskless. If they SAY they don’t have the shot, they have to be masked at work. AKA they don’t care if you actually have the shot, they just want you to <strong>preach</strong> that you do have it. It’s a way to make sure everyone appears to agree with the narrative by dangling the carrot on the stick. </p>
<p>They’ve also promised that if a single case is found, everyone in the company has to go back to wearing masks for 2 weeks. So lots of people won’t get tested because of that. The company leaders are clearly over and done with it, but they want to make sure the “company image” is safe by making sure all of the dissenters are heavily pressured to play along by getting the shot or lying and saying they got the shot. Manufactured narrative that everyone agrees with this stuff.</p></p>

        <p>Who said the two weeks for a single case ? Like work places ? I'm in the same state, closer the OH/KY boarders. I don't even pay attention to what they're saying anymore for the most part.. I've taken a COVID media break the last couple weeks.</p>
<p>I do know our signs have went from mask requirements to either masks recommended or the all exciting reward of "masks not required for fully vaccinated patrons"</p>
<p>Fuck off, ya psychos.</p>

        <p>Yes, if you’re a customer, they’ve thankfully stopped enforcing masks. What I’m talking about is employers. This is what some of the largest companies are forcing on their employees.</p>
<p>Maybe they’ll eventually give up and stop completely, but this is what they’re doing currently.</p>

        <p>Pretty much. God only knows what's going to happen in the future. I don't yet see any promising moves to really prevent future voter fraud. In fact, it looks like they're going to make ballot harvesting and mail-in voting even more permanent, wide-spread, and loose in rules than it was. Along with the fact I see no moves to limit "emergency" executive powers to 30 days max. So we can have a "crisis" like this every year and just fire the legislative branch. Who needs 'im, am I right? Governance is so much better when it's just one person calling the shots.</p>

        <p>Don't worry. The Canadian government will produce lots of material showing how happy the people are in their utopian republic. Just like the North Koreans are super happy and you always know it because of the pretty pictures!</p>

        <p>Great way to get fired. It's different when you're the customer. The worst that happens is they ask you to leave the store. Do that at work and you'll be fired.</p>

        <p>Good luck doing that. They aren’t asking for your medical information. They’re asking you to volunteer it, but you don’t have to. If you don’t volunteer it, then you have to be masked. If you do volunteer it and your answer is you’re unvaccinated, then you have to be masked.
I haven’t seen any companies successfully sued for requiring their employees to wear masks, even in states where there is no government mandate in place.</p>
