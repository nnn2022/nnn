    <strong>Covid hysterics have compared coronavirus to the 1918 pandemic repeatedly. One question: Where were the deadly variants in 1918?</strong>
    <p><p>It spread pretty much unchecked for two years.</p>
<p>Killed way more people than Covid.</p>
<p>But there was no Super Deadly Scary Variant that we're constantly told is just around the corner for Covid, despite flu mutating way faster.</p>
<p>Hmm...</p></p>

        <p>From John Barry's book the great influenza:</p>
<p>&rt; But the 1918 virus, like all influenza viruses, like all viruses that form mutant swarms, mutated rapidly. There is a mathematical concept called “reversion to the mean”; this states simply that an extreme event is likely to be followed by a less extreme event. This is not a law, only a probability.</p>
<p>&rt; The 1918 virus stood at an extreme; any mutations were more likely to make it less lethal than more lethal. In general, that is what happened. So just as it seemed that the virus would bring civilization to its knees, would do what the plagues of the Middle Ages had done, would remake the world, the virus mutated toward its mean, toward the behavior of most influenza viruses. As time went on, it became less lethal.</p>

        <p>Are you sure it wasn't the (non-exsitent) vaccine? Because I'm pretty sure the same thing is going to happen but it'll be because of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>FYI, most of what is presented about this era is used as propaganda today. Look for yourself at influenzaarchive.org/index.html. </p>
<p>The images tell more truth than the lies written about it in 2020. The average citizen was NOT diligent about useless NPIs, and rightfully so. Most of the mask images presented from the Influenza pandemic are photoshopped, or share the common theme of gov representatives as the subject, or are clearly staged photo ops. Candid pictures in that era almost never have average citizens in their useless gauze masks.</p>

        <p>“WAS AN ON-THE-SPOT OBSERVER OF THE 1918 INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC</p>
<p>All the doctors and people who were living at the time of the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic say it was the most terrible disease the world has ever had. Strong men, hale and hearty, one day would be dead the next. The disease had the characteristics of the black death added to typhoid, diphtheria, pneumonia, smallpox, paralysis and all the diseases the people had been vaccinated with immediately following World War 1. <strong>Practically the entire population had been injected "seeded" with a dozen or more diseases — or toxic serums. When all those doctor-made diseases started breaking out all at once it was tragic.</strong></p>
<p>That pandemic dragged on for two years, kept alive with the addition of more poison drugs administered by the doctors who tried to suppress the symptoms. <strong>As far as I could find out, the flu hit only the vaccinated. Those who had refused the shots escaped the flu. My family had refused all the vaccinations so we remained well all the time.</strong> We knew from the health teachings of Graham, Trail, Tilden and others, that people cannot contaminate the body with poisons without causing disease.</p>
<p>When the flu was at its peak, all the stores were closed as well as the schools, businesses — even the hospital, as <strong>the doctors and nurses had been vaccinated too and were down with the flu.</strong> No one was on the streets. It was like a ghost town. We seemed to be the only family which didn’t get the flu; so my parents went from house to house doing what they could to look after the sick, as it was impossible to get a doctor then. <strong>If it were possible for germs, bacteria, virus, or bacilli to cause disease, they had plenty of opportunity to attack my parents when they were spending many hours a day in the sick rooms. But they didn’t get the flu</strong> and they didn’t bring any germs home to attack us children and cause anything. None of our family had the flu — not even a sniffle— and it was in the winter with deep snow on the ground.</p>
<p>When I see people cringe when someone near them sneezes or coughs, I wonder how long it will take them to find out that they can’t catch it — whatever it is. The only way they can get a disease is to develop it themselves by wrong eating, drinking, smoking or doing some other things which cause internal poisoning and lowered vitality. All diseases are preventable and most of them are cureable with the right methods, not known to medical doctors, and not all drugless doctors know them either.</p>
<p>It has been said that the 1918 flu epidemic killed 20,000,000 people throughout the world. But, actually, the doctors killed them with their crude and deadly treatments and drugs. This is a harsh accusation but it is nevertheless true, judging by the success of the drugless doctors in comparison with that of the medical doctors.</p>
<p>While the medical men and medical hospitals were losing 33% of their flu cases, the non-medical hospitals such as BATTLE CREEK, KELLOGG and MACFADDEN’S HEALTH-RESTORIUM were getting almost 100% healings with their water cure, baths, enemas, etc., fasting and certain other simple healing methods, followed by carefully worked out diets of natural foods. One health doctor didn’t lose a patient in eight years. The very successful health treatment of one of those drugless doctors who didn’t lose any patients will be given in the other part of this book, titled VACCINATION CONDEMNED, to be published a little later.</p>
<p>If the medical doctors had been as advanced as the drugless doctors, there would not have been those 20 million deaths from the medical flu treatment.</p>
<p><strong>There was seven times more disease among the vaccinated soldiers than among the unvaccinated civilians, and the diseases were those they had been vaccinated against.</strong> One soldier who had returned from overseas in 1912 told me that the army hospitals were filled with cases of <strong>infantile paralysis</strong> and he wondered why grown men should have an infant disease. <strong>Now, we know that paralysis is a common after-effect of vaccine poisoning. Those at home didn’t get the paralysis until after the world-wide vaccination campaign in 1918.”</strong></p>

<p>1918: Rockefeller Institute administered an experimental meningitis vaccine in Fort Riley, Kansas, cultured in horses, that afflicted many with flu-like symptoms.  Just an odd coincidence that many historians also believe the <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-cases-reported-in-deadly-influenza-epidemic">“Spanish Flu” started in Fort Riley.</a></p>

 (1853-1923) was the principal business and philanthropic advisor to the major oil industrialist John D. Rockefeller, Sr., from 1891 to 1923.</p>
<p>In 1901, Frederick T. Gates designed the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University), of which he was board president. He then designed the Rockefeller Foundation, becoming a trustee upon its creation in 1913.</p>
<p>According to a 2008 National Institute of Health paper, <strong>bacterial pneumonia</strong> was the killer in a minimum of 92.7% of the autopsies of those who died of so-called “Spanish flu” between 1918 and 1919.”

<p><strong>Cover story involving horses?</strong></p>

<p><strong>”Professor John Oxford:</strong> The 1918 pandemic was huge.  I’ve spent a lot of my life working on it, I’ve even exhumed people who died in 1918 to get virus RNA from them.  When trying to understand where the virus came from, how it did what it did, and where it went to, we end-up grappling with death-toll.  Estimates of the number of deaths range from 40-100 million.  In some ways, <a href="https://thoughteconomics.com/virus-pandemics/">this virus was so big that we’ve all decided that something else must have happened- a unique set of circumstances in 1918.”</a></p>
<p><strong>A “unique set of circumstances” like a botched Rockefeller Institute vaccine?</strong></p>
