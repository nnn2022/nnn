        <p>I linked to that useful paper in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hosvhw/an_updated_critique_of_the_twopronged_idea_that_a/">my long, regularly updated, post about masks/muzzles</a>. However, I disagree with the title of your post: the reality is that the peer-reviewed literature on masks is all over the place, far from settled, with as many studies showing inefficacy and/or side effects, as studies showing efficacy. And precisely because the scientific verdict on masks is very far from being settled, it is irresponsible, irrational, and immoral to mandate or recommend masks to the public at large. That in effect transforms us in guinea pigs in an extra large social and biomedical experiment.</p>

        <p>It has a 99.95 % survival rate under 70... If politicians told you two years ago that masks were becoming mandatory due to the Influenza flu, you would of thought they caught dementia and needed to be replaced with somebody sane.</p>
<p>The influenza has an IFR of 0.1 % on yearly average, two times stronger then covid for under 70. Covid only has an IFR of 0.26 % cause the numbers are tainted... 84 years old with terminal cancer and 2 months to live, pass away and if they test " positive " for covid, which seems easy to do, they will write covid as cod in the majority of countries.</p>

<p>Fuck the masks, even if somehow, someway it actually prevented spreading, for something as useless and non lethal as covid and the flu, it doesn't make any sense... Masks are only there for behavioural modification and to remind people of the constant   " threat "</p>

        <p>Well anecdotal, I just crunched numbers in my cities cases. It’s too soon to tell but we had mandatory masking as of the 7th and data only goes up to the 14th. In terms of rolling averages, since the mandate we are no better or worse off in cases in their rate of decline and if anything the rate of decline has plateaued. So, anecdotal sure, at best we can say they really don’t do much—but this is Toronto Canada where the virus is under control. It’ll be interesting to track this for a few more weeks.</p>

        <p>I think people are really confused about what masks are for. Cloth masks are like surgical masks. The goal is not to protect the wearer, it's to protect those around them.</p>
<p>All contagious viral infections have a period of time when the person infected has no symptoms, but they are infectious. For Coronavirus, that period is about 3 to 5 days. Habitual wearing of masks means that when you get infected, the mask is stopping a significant fraction of respiratory droplets leaving your mouth and nose as you breathe, talk, cough, and sneeze. This translates to a reduction in the respiratory droplets in the air, and a reduction in how far those droplets travel before they evaporate. This translates to a reduction in the infection rate of those around you. This reduces the r value of the virus, which is how we both flatten the curve and move over the peak to a place where the virus can subside.</p>
<p>This article collects a number of studies showing that surgical and cloth masks do very little to protect the wearer from being infected. This is expected. This is not what the masks are for.</p>

<p>May I present a counter argument, the cloth mask can be effective at providing the spread of Covid-19? 
https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent</p>
<p>A study published in Health Affairs on June 6th https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818 for example, compared the COVID-19 growth rate before and after mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia. It found that mask mandates led to a slowdown in daily COVID-19 growth rate, which became more apparent over time. The first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points.</p>
