    <strong>It is time to start pushing back</strong>
    <p><p>We have all had to put up with this mask nonsense for a long time now. Even though all of the states have dropped their mask mandates, some businesses still refuse to see the light. 
You can do your part. If you visit or know of a business that refuses to serve you or let you enter without a mask, let the world know by posting a negative review on Google maps and Yelp. It only takes a few moments to let the world know that so-far-silent-majority have had it with these mask mandates and that if a private business wants to have their own mandate, they can pay the price.</p></p>

        <p>Pushing back is easy. 
I refuse to get vaxxed.
I refuse to wear a mask. 
I refuse to scan/check in.
I refuse to social distance. 
I refuse to comply with lockdowns.
I refuse to follow the arrows on the floor. 
I refuse to enter/exit the way they want.

        <p>My pet peeve right now is businesses that don’t take down old signage. New guidance comes out and they post a new sign but leave the old one leaving conflicting policy. Went to a restaurant today that had two signs saying Mask required to enter if you are unable to wear a mask speak to a manager. Then they had one with the updated Oregon guidance. 30-50% of the customers were going in without one. No one said anything. The hardware store had a 4ft tall sign saying Governor Brown requires us to inquire about your vaccination status, yet no one asked.</p>

        <p>I'm in Oregon too, I'm ashamed at how many have rolled over. I can't find anyone who feels as angry about all this as I am.</p>
<p>I used to tear down the stupid caution tape they put on the playgrounds and let my kids play freely, maskless. It would take them a couple days to put it back, but every time down it would go.</p>

        <p>I know two others who are as mad as me. We are in a rural area but close enough to Eugene. The school district was quick to allow kids and staff to unmask outside once the state allowed it while springfield and eugene declined to, so I am hopeful that when June 30 ( can’t believe we were the last state to set a timeline btw) rolls around and schools no longer have to comply with the state ready to learn shit our school makes masks optional for summer and beyond. Though the two vocal Unmask our kids candidates for school board both lost unfortunately. Haha I tore down the caution tape too at a county park they never put it back up but just put out a single construction cone with a sign.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I am in Hillsboro, on the very border but still. I can't believe they will allow that June 30 date to actually happen, so I will wait and see. Not that I care, I've been maskless almost the entire time. </p>
<p>I am so pissed that the school board campaign flopped so brazenly to the point where I think it must have been rigged. There were so many angry parents wanting to vote out the schoolboard but only 1 lady who happens to be black who also happens to have been the only one of the 4 diverse candidates to win by 51%???? The others all lost with only 49% of the vote. </p>
<p>I don't believe that vote count for one second, and I have to laugh at how racist Oregon blue voters are. Can't vote against a 'PoC' if their life depended on it. White liberals are the dumbest people I have ever met, and I hate that I have to qualify this statement by saying I am a 'PoC'. I've lived in many places, mostly in the deep south, and I have never faced such prejudice as when I moved here.</p>
<p>I'm so done with this state. I love the natural wildlife, the PNW is gorgeous, just not these crazy fools.</p>

        <p>I flew through two major airports today. One bearing seattle. I think one of the simplest things to do is to just not wear a mask. The first airport I made it all the way though security and to my gate before I was asked to mask up. I have to comply with airlines to do my job so I wear on on the plane but take it off as much on the plane as possible.Made it all the way to security without a mask at SeaTac. Here are some reasons I think this logically will work:
-people notice. Like almost everyone I walked past stared. The good thing, zero were malicious. It’s almost a bewildered look that is then snapping awake out of their subservient stupor. 
-It lets people know they aren’t alone, that they can stand/defy, and be bold
-The staff will get overwhelmed and tired of asking people to put on a mask. I do feel
Bad for them but sorry, necessary evil.</p>
<p>Tbh I’ve been defiant the whole time when possible so it doesn’t feel hard for me. And quite frankly, it’s pathetic that this is even a conversation when our forefathers spilled guts for our freedoms. Think of this as a small test/training ground. Build your grit and fortitude. There will be much harder tests on the horizon.</p>

        <p>“Each of you, for himself or herself, by himself or herself, and on his or her own responsibility, must speak. It is a solemn and weighty responsibility and not lightly to be flung aside at the bullying of pulpit, press, government or politician. Each must decide for himself or herself alone what is right and what is wrong, which course is patriotic and which isn’t. You cannot shirk this and be a man, to decide it against your convictions is to be an unqualified and inexcusable traitor. It is traitorous both against yourself and your country.</p>
<p>Let men label you as they may, if you alone of all the nation decide one way, and that way be the right way by your convictions of the right, you have done your duty by yourself and by your country, hold up your head for you have nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what the press says. It doesn’t matter what the politicians or the mobs say. It doesn’t matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right. Republics are founded on one principle above all else: The requirement that we stand up for what we believe in. no matter the odds or consequences.</p>
<p>When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move. Your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth and tell the whole world:</p>
<p>“No, you move.”” </p>
