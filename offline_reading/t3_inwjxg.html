<title>Nursing home residents and staff members account for around 40% of coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. And yet, the US seems to have focused all its energy trying to eliminate spread in the young and healthy in schools/universities which will very likely only prolong it all</title>

        <p>Obviously, the agenda dictates such policies. <a href="https://meteopolitique.com/Fiches/Vision/Analyse/Malheur/14.pdf">https://meteopolitique.com/Fiches/Vision/Analyse/Malheur/14.pdf</a></p>
<p>Page 18 to 25, Operation Lock Step scenario from 2010...</p>
<p>During the pandemic, national leaders around the world flexed their authority and imposed airtight rules and restrictions, from the mandatory wearing of face masks to body-temperature checks at the entries to communal spaces like train stations and supermarkets. Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified. In order to protect themselves from the spread of increasingly global problems — from pandemics and transnational terrorism to environmental crises and rising poverty — leaders around the world took a firmer grip on power.</p>
<p>At first, the notion of a more controlled world gained wide acceptance and approval. Citizens willingly gave up some of their sovereignty — and their privacy — to more paternalistic states in exchange for greater safety and stability. Citizens were more tolerant, and even eager, for top-down direction and oversight, and national leaders had more latitude to impose order in the ways they saw fit. In developed countries, this heightened oversight took many forms: biometric IDs for all citizens, for example, and tighter regulation of key industries whose stability was deemed vital to national interests.</p>
