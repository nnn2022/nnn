    <strong>Quotes from On Liberty</strong>
    <p><p>In these times of censorship and suppression of discussion, I thoughts I would share some favorite quotes from <em>On Liberty</em> by John Stuart Mill. Let me know your favorite.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"The will of the people [...] means, the will of the most numerous of the most active part of the people; the majority, or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority: the people, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other abuse of power."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"[A]ges are no more infallible than individuals; every age having held many opinions which subsequent ages have deemed not only false but absurd[.]"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"History teems with instances of truth put down by persecution."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"[T]hat which would strengthen and enlarge men's mind, free and daring speculation on the highest of subjects, is abandoned."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"No one can be a great thinker who does not recognise, that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his intellect to whatever conclusions it may lead."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Both teachers and learners go to sleep at their post, as soon as there is no enemy in the field."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"[E]very opinion which embodies somewhat of the portion of truth which the common opinion omits, ought to be considered precious, with whatever amount of error and confusion that truth may be blended."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"However unwillingly a person who has a strong opinion may admit the possibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to be moved by the consideration that however true it may be, if it is not fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma, not a living truth."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"A person whose desires and impulses are his own--are the expression of his own nature, as it has been developed and modified by his own culture--is said to have a character."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"[W]e may express our distaste, and we may stand aloof from a person as well as from a thing that displeases us; but we shall not therefore feel called on to make his life uncomfortable."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"[A] State which dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes, will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished."</p></p>
