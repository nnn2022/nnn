    <strong>We will never go back to the old days before covid</strong>
    <p><p>I have a few questions:</p>
<p>Now that the conspiracy theories you've been making fun of for the past ten months are slowly coming true one by one ... are you still laughing?
Now that the first quarantine breaker jail is being built, now that fatal vaccine damage is no longer a rumor, now that armbands are very popular for attendees, now that children without masks are beaten down on the street, now that compulsory tests and -  Vaccinations, while illegal, are still the order of the day, now that tech giants are restricting freedom of expression around the world, now that critical doctors are losing their license, now that it has become evident that the super-rich will emerge as the big winners of the crisis while  poverty rises to dizzying heights ... are you still sitting there so self-righteously, waving your forefinger, shouting “conspiracy!” and laughing yourselves out?</p>
<p>Has it already got through to you that this world has lost all dignity and humanity or does it still need a bit?  A little more pain, a little more hunger, a little more arbitrariness, a little more hatred, a little more police violence?  Maybe a little civil war?</p>
<p>And just as hypothetical ... if it ever comes to the point that your penny drops before this world finally goes down the drain: do you think you will then have the size to apologize?  With the friends you betrayed and with the neighbors you denounced?  With the employees you fired and the customers you humiliated?  With the children whom you tormented with the masks and with all fellow men whose life you made hell?
Now that you can experience first-hand how fascism works and slowly realize that it sometimes just changes the cloak ... can we finally break off the experiment or do we really have to play it to the end so that you can say afterwards that you got off  didn't know anything?</p>
<p>I thought I'd ask, just to find out how things are with the current level.</p></p>

        <p>They can show us whatever they please on the news and most of us will believe it's real. And so they can create a virus as powerful as they like because if they say so it must be so. If you don't think that's possible just look at what happened in 2020-2021.</p>

        <p>I don't watch TV at all, stopped before 6 or 7 years becuse main tool for every propaganda is TV. Use Internet, it's much better source of information and you can compare everything, find both sides of coin.
For sure there is a lot of lies as well, even more than truths but if you know how to look and search you can figure out what is real and what is propaganda</p>

        <p>A worse virus has shown up. The vaccine. When they ‘flip the switch’ and people start dropping by the tens of thousands because of their vaccine, they are going to claim it’s because of the ultimate mutation of covid,  and then they’ll clamp down completely.</p>

<p>I wrote that today. It will stop the moment we bludgeon the highest echelon of governments and the back row elites who did this. Not before. They have everything in their grip and they wont loosen it. This coming summer will be the last summer where you can actually <em>do</em> something. I for one will enjoy every moment and hope to find enough diverse groups just in case they go down again with closing everything.</p>

        <p>If that next time is again in ten years, sadly, I don't care anymore. I "lived through" SARS1 and the swine flu and nobody in my cohort seems to care. Well, if they don't, I do neither. Fuck their kids, it's their families they are destroying, if they want that, they can have it. After 50 I don't think I have the same needs and at this point, if one does not have either a crypto-underground network or is a total normie under normies, you have other problems.</p>

        <p>After the fifth iteration of bullshit you give up. My peers are fucking stupid. First was 9/11, then Anthrax, then SARS, then the banking "crisis", then swine flu and now this. Since I can't have descendants my motivation is pretty low. Everybody I know in my inner circle is earning double the median and doing very well, for at least another 20 years or is receiving a decent pension.<br>
These five mentioned happenings are what humans do to other humans, no nature or pollution involved where innocent bystanders get mangled. We could decide no, this is never happening anymore without any other change. Just don't do it (TM).<br>
They don't want to engage, learn about or prohibit clusterfacks like the five above and I am not affected in any way by them (except maybe because of the vaccine), so why should I do something tangible which harms me and my immediate and near relatives and friends?</p>
<p>I am posting and reading here because I still care in general because of the morality behind it and I wonder if there is any resistance in any form left over.</p>

        <p>It’d take a huge effort in deprogramming the likes of which we haven’t seen for 75 years. Question is, will they think it’s worth the effort?</p>

        <p>Well written.</p>
<p>I wish i could be optimistic but i think you are right. Last year i was laughing at all of you "conspiracy theorists"(please forgive me lol) but when i woke up i was like shit they really got me and it is those "crazies" who were right since the beginning. Since then,all the predictions are happening one by one and that's what's scary.</p>
<p>I am seriously considering leaving my job because the machine is too big and i don't want to be a part of that plan who purposely let people die. I don't want to tell a patient sorry but you're no longer on our list of priority,looks like you'll die sorry..No...</p>
<p>The mass of doomers is so brainwashed,i really feel like most of them are lost causes unfortunately. 
I'll keep fighting tho ! But something drastic has to change for us to win this war.</p>

        <p>&rt; Now that the conspiracy theories you've been making fun of for the past ten months are slowly coming true one by one ... are you still laughing?</p>
<p>I am the "conspiracy theorist". So no. Getting real tired of being right though.</p>
