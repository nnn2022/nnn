    <strong>I'm finding it really exhausting / annoying / boring of people including family / in laws / cow workers asking if and when I'm getting th3 vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm in the UK and myself and my husband have no plans to get the vaccine. Mostly everyone I know has had it and it's all they talk about. </p>
<p>At any family gathering (mainly his family, they're all lovely, really nice people btw) they ask when we're getting it. </p>
<p>My husband is the most laid back person I've ever met, loves a joke and doesn't care what folks think of him.
 He will respond all jokey saying 'we don't want any microchips in us so we're not getting it'. </p>
<p>They all react and start saying things like 'oh you not wanting to go on holiday though' or 'oh no you have to get it to stop the spread' he just continues to say 'nah I'm good thanks'. </p>
<p>Now they've started telling people- other extended family that we aren't getting it. They need give their two cents and tell us how we have to get it. </p>
<p>My husband is going to speak to his mother about keeping g her nose out of our vaccine business. </p>
<p>Anyone else have these issues? </p>
<p>P.s I love his family, they're the nicest people I've ever met and they are all for the vaccine, don't really know the bigger agenda etc so I'm pretty sure we just come across as the jokers who don't take anything seriously. I'd just love some good simple things to say to sort of end the vaccine convo but in a polite way.</p>
<p>EDIT. I messed up the spelling in the title. Damn it.</p></p>

        <p>Firstly, well done.</p>
<p>Secondly, stand your ground, hold fast and stop making jokes because people will then choose to belittle you. You have a very good reason clearly so tell them what it is. Let them bring their garbage response to it but it will end the conversation. Jokes will just continue it. </p>
<p>Mine for example would be that I have never taken an experimental vaccine before and Iâ€™m not going to start now, once it becomes approved and I have seen the outcome of the next few years I will consider it. Right now every single thing happening tells me something is seriously wrong and I trust my gut feeling more than some nob heads who come over to my house for a Bbq thinking I owe them more than a burger and a beer. </p>
<p>Finally, If they donâ€™t like it theyâ€™re not really your friends, no matter how nice they are friends do not belittle you, so theyâ€™re dicks, and you donâ€™t need them coming around your house right now. </p>
<p>They can come over and apologise in a few months time.</p>

        <p>I tell people that I'm waiting to see the results of the trial phase that they're part of and then I'll decide.</p>
<p>If they make it uncomfortable by pushing the question, I ask them if and what STD's they've had since we're apparently exploring each others health in detail.</p>

        <p>Yes.  For some, I think they really are concerned and have 'drunk the coolaid' and think you are going to die (because someone on their favorite news station said so).  They just want to help you to understand how important it is and how it will help everyone.  They think you are just <em>uneducated</em> about it...little do they realize that we (most of us anyway) have spent literally hours researching/reading/studying every trial, test, study, article concerning the real science of it...<strong>not</strong> watching the MSM but doing our own research, which the MSM does not talk about.</p>
<p><strong><em>But</em></strong>, there are others that truly just want us to be herded up and killed.</p>

        <p>Say you got it even though you didnâ€™t. Thatâ€™s what I did to get some family members off my back. If they live at a distance, no real way for them to confirm.</p>

        <p>The reported rise in cases in the UK is quite frankly simply made up. I <br>
have it on good authority that one particular hospital in a densely <br>
populated area of London has closed the on-site covid ward and the last <br>
time they reported a positive covid test in the maternity ward was back <br>
in January.  No one knows who or where anyone is testing positive but <br>
apparently there is still a massive threat!</p>

        <p>Your cow  workers?  You wonâ€™t look at them the same way again.  ðŸ˜‚</p>

        <p>I know this is a joke but we really have to stop with this microchip business. The vaccine isn't properly tested, it isn't needed and it isn't moral to pressure people into it. That is our line. </p>
<p>Not some bullshit on microchips or 5G David Icke nonsense, that just puts us in the same group as the HAARP weather control, Hollywood moon landing sorts.</p>
<p>I knkw you're having a joke around but we need to stop with that, this is serious and the chip stuff is an easy weapon that will be used to crush anyone remotely skeptical of the vaccine. Do not give them ammunition.</p>

        <p>How am I a troll? I'm serious. Magnets on arms and microchips will have you laughed out of the room.
Do you care about stopping lockdowns and vaccines? Or do you just want to have fun posting on reddit? Because if you care about the former drop the microchip nonsense</p>
