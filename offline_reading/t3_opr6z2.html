        <p>Before all this started, at least on reddit, there was already hatred towards anti-vaxxers.</p>
<p>Even the most seemingly random subreddit would drop a pro-vaxx meme mocking the anti-vax.</p>
<p>I didn't even know pro-vax / anti-vax was a thing at the time (not even what "vax" meant). I learned about it because these people kept injecting the issue into the most seemingly un-related subreddits, so I did some research into it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the pro-vaxxer tactic was to make the other side appear to be stupid and pressure other people on the sidelines to conform to the pro-vax side via fear of being mocked and ridiculed. They weren't even presenting arguments or evidence, they were just attacking anti-vaxxers and showing off how they'll make your life miserable if you don't conform to their beliefs.</p>
<p>Anyway, the whole point of my post is that there was an effort to condition people, via peer pressure and mocking anyone who disagrees with them, into blindly accepting vaccines. And this is where we're at today - people so brainwashed or afraid to speak out are just going along with it. They don't even believe they have to present an argument or counter-argument since "the science is settled" in their minds.</p>
<p>And, IMO, that's why we see a lot of this craziness today.</p>

        <p>I rarely visit any other subreddit these days, apart from this.</p>
<p>Because it doesn't take long to find someone saying people who won't take the vax should he imprisoned or killed. Upvoted as well. </p>
<p>I know for 100% we're on the right side of history. But I wish shit would hit the fan sharpish. Maybe then I can enjoy reddit again.</p>
<p>Although maybe I'll never enjoy it again? I always thought the average redditor was a sheep looking for others to form their opinions for them, so they don't have to think. That was bad enough. But now it seems the average redditor is a nasty, ignorant, fascist cunt. That's gonna be really hard to forget...</p>

        <p>I love how that claim is attacked.</p>
<p>The pro-vaxxers dig up some guy who tried to discredit the measles vaccine and tie it with autism in order to promote his own treatment. He did some very biased and dishonest research to back it up.</p>
<p>Then they use his example to disprove the claim:
-made about another vaccine (also for measles but conjoined with others, called MMR) - so whatever was false for the other product might be right for that one
-made by people who never heard about the guy, never cited his research, had no connection whatsoever with him or his argument
-based solely on worrying data from the vaccination of the local populace.</p>
<p>It is as idiotic as taking some guy who advocated for heliocentrism by stating that he God of Sun is having a higher position in pantheon than the Goddess of Earth, show his ties to the temple of said God and using this forever onward to discredit anyone claiming that the sun is in the center of the solar system.</p>

        <p>It was on general social media back in 2015-16 pretty heavily. When I used to scroll aimlessly through FB, a lot of memes suddenly started getting shared about "anti-vaxxers", mostly that super edgy "lmao your kid died of polio because you didn't VAXX" type stuff. It was confusing because for the life of me I couldn't think of any vaccine at the moment causing controversy or any medical threat in NA and Europe which a vaccine could solve. Makes sense now, unfortunately.</p>
<p>It's also annoying how the Overton Window has shifted so far that the default position in polite society is "fervently pro-Pharma" nowadays. We're supposed to believe that now, because of a mild flu bug, Big Pharma suddenly <em>really</em> cares about us and isn't doing their usual harmful nonsense which has cost them billions in fines and settlements? That the opioid epidemic these companies knowingly perpetuated for profit is just a separate issue and they just <em>really</em> don't want us to get a nasty cough which could maybe inconvenience us for a day or two? That all it took was the sniffles for them to change their ways? Hallmark movies have more believable plots than this.</p>

        <p>Yes, even before this CoVid craziness I saw the attitude displayed towards anyone thinking critically about any vaccine (not even being that much against them) as dangerous. I come from a country with mandatory vaccination for many diseases and even questioning these laws was enough to be branded an anti-vaxxer. The 'holy cow' approach anything labeled as a vaccine was troubling for me. People just did not treat a medical treatment like they would treat any other such treatment as long as it was called a vaccine.</p>
<p>Fast forward to our current situation. We have treatments developed based on two novel technologies, which in itself should discredit any comparison. They seem to fail in achieving what traditional vaccines claim to do, which is yet another major difference. Yet they are called the same name and voila - claiming anything less than positive about it is forbidden as misinformation.</p>

        <p>If you think this is a major depopulation event, you’re going to make yourself and this sub look like idiots. Will people die? Sure. ADE is going to knock out a ton of people this winter. </p>
<p>But too many dying at once would trigger mass revolt and leave a large group of people with nothing to lose. And it stops the gravy train for pharma companies and their beneficiaries. </p>
<p>More than likely it’s way for endless booster shots that hope to stop ADE. This hands your bodily autonomy over to pharma companies and the govt and gives them massive control.</p>

        <p>We’re on the same side here. They want people dead, but their plans aren’t what we think they are. They might work to some degree, but complete dystopia is off the table. </p>
<p>The idea that the elites are far smarter than us, at least in modern days, is a psyop. If they’re so much smarter than us, why is literally everything they do so sloppy?</p>
<p>Most modern elites were handed down power. They’re not their grandparents, nor their great-grandparents. They have their goals and ideas, but most of them have crappy implementations of them because they, like most younger generations, are lazier than their predecessors. </p>
<p>And the elites aren’t united. This is another psyop. Most have conflicting goals that cause even more sloppy work; you can see it in this scamdemic too many times to list. All these Davos and other “secret” meetings are just to show face. These have been going on for how many years and somehow we don’t live in their ideal world? How can that be?</p>

        <p>Yes we are on the same team but if you notice they use symbolism of their religion to normalize and make real not only to them but to us subconsciously and your correct about how they handed down but what did they hand down? Not only money and power but they handed down their religious construct and devilish beliefs. Who would we be to their children besides how they look at us?</p>
<p>The elites are very much united into the same religious construct and don't think for themselves because they follow the devilish brilliance of the words and knowledge of the books and understanding they all have for each other.</p>
<p>Nothing they do is sloppy at all, it's just that god is more powerful in the minds of men than devilish trickery and is able to point out shortcomings better than people who accept the devil, that's how the world's balances, negative and positive runs the battery that is this world and all god (positive electrode) is doing is trying to balance so the battery (the world) can continue and the devil (negative electrode) can take over the battery. Or we must just be running out of battery.</p>

        <p>Nope, it's an accurate analogy. Our species (like others) values social conformity. The ostracized human doesn't survive. In today's society we can fare (somewhat) better in isolation, but we have a natural inclination to go with the flow... watch some candid camera conformity experiments and you will see.</p>

<p>Hey doomers that read this.  Tell you something so we can be on the same page and save some time.  If I get sick I stay at home until I'm well and haven't had a fever for 24 hours.  I've done this for over 30 years.  If I DO get COVID and it DOES kill me the world will little note nor long remember my passing.  You see unlike most people I do not fear death.  When it comes for me I'll just smile at it and say 'well okay let's go'.  I won't like it but nobody ever gets out of life alive.</p>

        <p>Patience is the key.</p>
<p>Better to be stuck at home for a bit until the world wakes up. And I'm convinced it will happen. The propaganda is soooo desperate now, and there must be a reason... </p>
<p>Nothing at this stage could persuade me to have the vax.</p>
<p>Don't forget that if you have the vax, you sign up to to all the boosters too.</p>
<p>If you really are struggling and can't wait it out for long at least wait until a vaccine comes out the works like other vaccines did before the covid ones.</p>

        <p>The whole science is settled crap gets to me. Science is never settled.. science is constantly evolving.. and furthermore, science can't be settled in an on-going study, which is what this is. </p>
<p>People use this phrase because of the rigorous studies that have gone into previous vaccines.. well they must all be the same! Suuuure.. a never before used technology that has not even had animal studies because they fast tracked it, is flawless....  MKAY.</p>

        <p>Welcome to hell, welcome to the end times.</p>
<p>You better let the government control your health with yearly injections that have a higher chance of killing you than if you didn’t take them.</p>
<p>If you don’t take them you’re literally a nazi though.</p>
<p>Also give us your guns</p>
<p>And vax your kids, I know it’s a way higher chance they die or have horrendous side effects from the vaccine compared to Covid but if you don’t eventually we’ll take them from you.</p>
<p>Also, I see you’ve all been forging the vaccine card, since we just got rid of paper money stick this chip we patented back in 2020 in your right hand so we can scan you to insure you’re not a public health risk. Bright side of things is you don’t need a wallet anymore! It’s a digital ID! You can only buy and sell in this world with one though!</p>
<p>Mark of the beast?!?!? Never heard of it!</p>
