        <p>Disclaimer: I know there are plenty of vaccine-skeptical people here, and I'll respect their right to do what they want with their body as long as they respect mine.</p>
<p>But what really grinds my cheese was getting a message from my health insurance company with a vaccine FAQ. One of them was, "Can I choose which vaccine I get?" and the answer was "No, it is important you take what's available ASAP."</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, WTF is that?? What if one of them is more likely to cause an allergic reaction in me due to the ingredients? I have had <em>plenty</em> of times I have discussed different treatment options with health care providers. But for this thing it's just "shut up and do as told."</p>
<p>I was willing to take J&amp;J, but I'm sure as hell not going to sign up for anything that comes down to, "We're injecting you with this experimental cocktail, and we're not even going to tell you what you're getting!"</p>

        <p>Does anyone feel like, in general, people are doubling down on masks and restrictions? I am happy to see several states reopen fully and drop the mask mandate but...it still feels like the general response to that has been to double down on restrictions. Just this morning, my husband and I went to sign paperwork for our house and the law office had a sign on the door that said "due to increased COVID cases, we are only allowing people in the office who have an appointment..." Increased COVID cases?? Where? Cases have been going down in my state. I suppose it could have been an old sign but still. </p>
<p>It just seems like people are so used to these restrictions that they don't want to go back to normal. And then I hear that Disney World (I don't know why I bother reading about Disney World anymore; all it does is piss me off) are making their mask restrictions even more strict and they are now requiring that groups over 4 people split up to allow for more "social distancing." Like...?? Florida has been fully open for months and they technically don't even have to have these rules. They have had these rules since they reopened in July and keep making them stricter. When is the time to ease up? </p>
<p>It seems like there is never a good time to ease up on restrictions. Even my own company, who isn't even requiring that people go back to the office, sent out an email to remind people that just because other states are dropping the mask mandate that masks are still required in the office....when no one even goes into the office anyway. Um, okay? Literally 5 people are going into the office but thanks for the mask reminder. </p>
<p>Sorry for the long rant. Didn't mean to turn this into a diary entry!</p>

        <p>My vet won't even let me go into the office with my cat. I agree that people are just used to this "new normal" and are too lazy or freaked out to change back. </p>
<p>All of these lockdowns and policies were created out of an "emergency," and now that it's not an emergency anymore, they don't wanna change back. Cat is out of the bag, and until 0 people have Covid, it ain't ever going back.</p>

        <p>It feels like that here besides 2 places I'm allowed to shop where no one one bothers me but most people in them still wear masks anyways. I have seen way too many double maskers here working in retail then I care to know, it's no lie that there are a large number of people here actually eating it up. A lot of people just do not want to go back to normal at this point and the best we can do as sad as it is be still remaining beacons of humanity in this mess. Harder in some areas than others.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I just don't understand the mask obsession. I have also seen double maskers. I would think that masks would be the first thing that people would want to get rid of. Guess not!</p>

        <p>Nope. Some people around here mind as well just glue it to their face cause to them it's like a part of them now. I have only seen one super doomer though lately. Someone that had facemasks, face shield, and gloves on making sure to stand very far away making any interaction mission impossible.Some people I can tell they're gonna be doing it for the rest of their lives.</p>

        <p>I live in Toronto, Ontario.</p>
<p>Ontario, Canada has a population of 15 million people.</p>
<p>We have had around 7300 deaths from covid.</p>
<p>If you look at the numbers, only 31 out of 15 million people who died were between the ages of 1-39.</p>
<p>Only 300 were between 0-59.</p>
<p>2000 deaths were between 60 and 79 and 5000 deaths were ages 80 and up.</p>
<p>Yes, an eledery persons life obviously has value but the average life expectancy in Canada is 81. I imagine a lot of the people who died would have also likely died with a strong cold.</p>
<p>We locked down all off society twice now, ruined careers, bankrupted people, caused psychological damage that I think will take years to show for a virus that killed 300 people under the age of 60.</p>
<p>I dont understand why we didn't realize this earlier and keep everything open but protect the eledery better.</p>

        <p>I work with about 25 people. I (along with one other person) am the ONLY one that chose not to get vaccinated. People keep asking me if I got mine, and I have to pull some excuse out of my ass as to why I didn't. </p>
<p>I started with "I'll let others who need it more than I do have it first." </p>
<p>But that makes it sound like I want it eventually. </p>
<p>If I say "I'm young and healthy, I don't need it" I get lectured about how I can transmit it to someone and kill them. </p>
<p>Cases are down and most vulnerable/older people have been vaccinated already. Thus, FUCK OFF about me not being vaccinated. "Herd immunity" can suck my dick.</p>

        <p>We live in a bit of a rural area and it's a normal occurence to see people without a mask coming through the general store. As I was checking out, my grandma popped in without her mask (she didn't realize this) and said she'd meet me back at the truck.</p>
<p>I kept the observation to myself and said "see you out there". </p>
<p>As she was walking out the store I shouted to her "how was your mask free shopping, you little rebel!" She laughed and said she hadn't noticed till she was talking to the cashier, who had ripped off her mask in solidarity. Haha. Just thought that was funny.</p>

        <p>The mink culling in Denmark has me scared shitless, I cannot stop thinking about how far that mentality might go.  If you’d told me what things are like now in 2019, I wouldn’t have believed it, so who knows what the next unbelievable steps could be.  Minks today, cats on the streets tomorrow.  I am so worried about my pets, I don’t know what I’d do without them, I never want to live in a world that doesn’t allow us to interact with animals.  I know it sounds stupid, but I can’t stop worrying about it.</p>

        <p>That doesn't sound stupid... The uk is euthanizing people's pet chickens (small backyard hobby flocks) and the owner's couldn't even save them with negative tests from veterinarians. It's a war on decentralized food production first and foremost, but the great reset probably doesn't allow for the slaves to keep companion animals of any type.</p>

        <p>I hadn't even heard of the mink culling. That is scary! </p>
<p>Maybe try to get them registered as emotional support animals...? You're probably good either way, but it wouldn't hurt to have an additional argument. </p>

        <p>I know i should buy groceries during the day because of the lockdown restrictions and curfew is at 8 in Quebec.. i shouldn't place all the blame in the lockdown but hell, there are weeks since this curfew had started where i order a lot of uber eats or have little food in my fridge and get hungry at night because i don't feel like going to buy food during the day. I work evening shifts and this is frustrating, I usually hit the grocery store next to my job after work but since the curfew is implemented I can't do that anymore. There are days where I work 10 hours and I have no time to buy food. Of course I can wake up earlier and it's just my learned helplessness to an extent. I could wake up earlier, I could just go in the morning and come back home..But this routine isn't for me. My job is physical and food is provided at work but I really hate the curfew.</p>

        <p>Same, the curfew does fucking nothing. They don’t do any “extra cleaning” and literally don’t have to. It’s all just bullshit to pay minimum wage workers less. I’m also eating a lot less because of that.</p>
