    <strong>I work at a horribly overcrowded jail.</strong>
    <p><p>You would think COVID spreads like wildfire in that type of environment. Some of the pods are just huge auditoriums with bunks while others are open bay. 80-100 people in some of the pods, concrete walls, fluorescent lights, minimal movement among the rest of the facility, 1-2 hours of outside time each day. You would think if one person gets COVID and the pod gets quarantined, then 80-100 people get COVID. It never works that way. The vaccination rate sits at around 25%, so it‚Äôs not that.</p>
<p>Just recently the inmate worker pod, which moves around the entire facility making food, doing laundry, cleaning the floors had one inmate test positive. They locked down the pod so nobody was going in or out - the inmate worker pods are the most overpopulated in the facility because inmates are out working in the facility all hours of the day and night. So at any given time, a portion of the inmates are not present. One open population pod (the ‚Äúauditorium‚Äù) was placed on quarantine, which had over 90 inmates stuck in there with each other for 10 days. You would think almost all 90 inmates would test positive in the end.</p>
<p>Initial round of testing all inmates showed 6 positive cases. Nobody else was positive the rest of that ten day period. Even in that environment, they couldn‚Äôt get them to comply with wearing masks, they don‚Äôt have hand sanitizer, and all they can do is hang out and wash their hands.</p>
<p>This happens every time we have an ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù. Maybe up to 10 positive cases, pod gets quarantined, and then it just goes away. If it doesn‚Äôt spread in that close contact unsanitary environment, it definitely doesn‚Äôt spread that fast in the free world.</p></p>

        <p>I understand sir.. </p>
<p>Think of it this way.. would you purposefully suck on the end of the tailpipe of your car and inhale the exhaust? Of course not.. it would be dangerous and self-destructive to do that.</p>
<p>Same goes for smoking. There is no doubt about the effects of smoking.</p>
<p>The best part of quitting smoking (you break the habit through vape) is that your lungs will repair themselves and clear up on their own if done early.</p>
<p>Just don't get into vape culture - Vaping was treatment for people to quit smoking, by breaking the habit and slowly weening themselves off of nicotine.</p>
<p>But manufacturers made it cool to vape (with clouds of smoke puffs, etc) and a whole industry of tasty oils.. and now more kids are addicted to nicotine (in even higher amounts).</p>
<p>It also helps to quit such things (and consumption of other things) once you get an attitude of self-preservation, and look at such things as poison.</p>
<p>Hey I'm not perfect, but when I go through an average store now buying food, so easy to resist all the crap, because it signifies poison, bad health and literally "This company is willing to sell me crap to eat just to make a $$ f-them"</p>

        <p>Yes, I have read some papers on that.. Shhh dont tell smokers.</p>
<p>Yet on the other end.. after lifelong smoking, they are the biggest users of the ICU, oxygen tanks and ventilators that Canada and the USA claimed to have a shortage of..</p>
<p>More smokers died in the same period than did covid19 deaths.. And they are listed as covid19 deaths, because the smokers' inherent respiratory illness, hypertension and other related diseases were relegated to 'pre-existing conditions' and covid19 getting the credit on the death certificate.</p>

        <p>Oh, I wasn't trying to say that the trade off was worth it, just that it possibly helps to curtail the spread of Covid in crowded places like prisons where most of the inmates smoke. It has enough negative issues associated with it that I certainly wouldn't suggest it as a method to avoid Covid. And they way they count Covid deaths skews the statistics. in a way that renders them useless for drawing conclusions.</p>

        <p>You might be interested to know some strange statistics regarding covid19 outbreaks:</p>
<p>Most have occurred in:</p>
<p>1) Long term residences<br>
2) Hospice / Elderly care<br>
3) Other related health facilities </p>
<p>4) Prisons</p>
<p>5) Meat/food processing plants</p>
<p>Strange huh?</p>
<p>You'd think all these facilities would be more protected and resilient against covid19 or any entry of infection, because they:</p>
<p>1) Will have locked front doors, or buzz entry/ supervised entry/exit</p>
<p>2) Have sign in desks, checkpoints, entry gates</p>
<p>3) Have heightened healthy measures and practices in place, food handlers wear protective clothing, suits, gloves to prevent food contamination</p>
<p>4) Trained staff who follow strict health guidelines or facility has strict guidelines.</p>
<p>In fact, in 2020, this was happening to us so much in Canada - reports of outbreaks in meat processing facilities - that I sent an email to CSIS to 'investigate potential reasons why meat processing facilities across Canada were reporting infections' and to 'consider that perhaps a common individual may be visiting all these facilities either spreading infection or purposefuly sabotaging our food supply'.</p>

        <p>Hmm. That's an interesting idea. Our meatpacking plant is owned by the Chinese and is focused on profit over everything else, to the point where they lied to the mayor, governor and OSHA, swearing up and down that they had closed down to clean and were taking all precautions when they were still running full shifts. So while they were a major factor in our local Covid numbers, I figured it was just callous management, not sabotage.</p>
