<p>But it sfar from back to normal there's still bulk propaganda they still want you tracked and monitored every where you go. And I guarantee when they want to start rolling out the vaccine here in a few months time there will be an "outbreak"</p>

        <p>I consider a two week quarantine and test requirement a regional lockdown, still. And being tracked wherever you go. I saw your PM say people can opt to not have the test and just stay in quarantine indefinitely, with the most sadistic smile on her face. And I agree. Lockdowns don't make the virus disappear.</p>
<p>I'm in Hawaii, and tourism is our lifeline. Big Ag, not small farms, is pretty far behind it and doesn't contribute anything meaningful to the economy. So we were looking at NZ a LONG time ago. We could not legally close our borders, but every county in the state did the two week quarantine thing for a while and it was a disaster. There's no one place, even per county (with its own rules, often), to get updated info. People were confused and mad. I think we hit 30% unemployed due to lockdowns, and there are people who still have not been paid a penny of unemployment. It took me months. Then most counties began opting for second negative tests upon arrival, while Kauai county remains with the 2 week quarantine and probably insanity like curfews and road blocks. I don't know how people are surviving over there. My county requires a second test when you land now, too. And they have to be PCR tests from certain companies, even though none of them can detect the live virus.</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree that there's a real (but I think only like 10%) risk of them trying to be stupidly overcautious once everyone in NZ has had the opportunity to get vaccinated, but I'll worry about that closer to the time, meanwhile COVID is the thing that this government has fucked up the least, so I'm not complaining about it too much.</p>

        <p>So you are saying every single day people get in NZ and have the disease. </p>
<p>Really strange since they are all tested against covid before departing their countries. So which one is it, is it the test that's unreliable, the gov just keeps up making cases or they are popping up new cases out of the blue (in an island).</p>

        <p>It takes up to 5ish days to get a positive test IIRC, and PCR can still have false negatives (although basically no false positives), that's why we have a 2 week quarantine rather than relying on testing.</p>
<p>We get a handful of cases a day <strong>AT THE BORDER</strong> that are detected by testing everyone in quarantine on day and 12, and we've had about 4 or 5 community outbreaks since the original lockdown: most of these were very quickly traced to a border worker and quashed without the rest of society needing to do anything, one is still of unknown origin (possibly came in on frozen food, possibly patient zero is lying) and needed a couple of weeks of lockdown-lite.</p>
<p>There are not random cases popping up in the community. Every one that does is front page national news for days, and it's been a couple of months since the last one.</p>

        <p>I believe you may be misunderstanding our news. For the last couple of months, every single new case has been someone who just flew in from overseas, with their case detected while they were in managed isolation/ quarantine. e.g. today's report: https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/434049/covid-19-six-new-cases-in-managed-isolation-and-quarantine</p>

        <p>Here's our MOH website, where worldometer gets its data from (you can also see suspected cases, e.g. kids who we don't want to put a stick up their nose to test, as opposed to the confirmed positive test results we report to WHO)</p>
<p>https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-source-cases</p>
<p>There was a big jump recently (your 19 cases probably) from the reporting delay over Chrismtas, but on that graph you can seethese are all imported,  the last big local outbreak was in September, and you can kind of eyeball the tiny local outbreak in October, that we managed to catch with only contact tracing and no lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I see that, so the NZ gov claims that every single case of covid detection is because of travelers entering the country. So if nobody enters the country there will be zero cases. Is that what you're saying?</p>
<p>Well I don't believe that. The reason is if one of the travelers in a flight has it, everyone else in that flight has the potential to have it. So what you do?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; possibly came in on frozen food, possibly patient zero is lying </p>
<p>It means you don't know. In the same way absolutely anything, any item, any particle, that enters the country could have sars. Including the travelers baggage.</p>
<p>It is summer in NZ right now. Similar figures they publish happened in some european countries last July, August. So I don't see anything extraordinary. The human metabolism is up during summer weather and able to better withstand more stress than in winter. You will see cases going up again in winter.</p>

<p>In a similar way to how NZ has no Malaria, or Rabies, or Ebola, or Smallpox, or Polio, yes. Like, this isn't a mysterious conspiracy. I know people that work at the quarantine facilities, and people that work in public health. There is zero chance that COVID has been circulating undetected in the community since March. All of the cases we've found in the last 2 months have been in people while they're still in quarantine, and we're still doing a hell of a lot of testing of random people in the community.</p>
<p>&rt;The reason is if one of the travelers in a flight has it, everyone else in that flight has the potential to have it. So what you do?</p>
<p>We isolate everyone on <strong>every</strong> flight in small bubbles in a quarantine hotel for 14 days, and give them a couple of COVID tests over that period.</p>
<p>&rt;It means you don't know.</p>
<p>I know, that's why I said:</p>
<p>&rt;one is still of unknown origin</p>
<p>You can see my link from before how we had basically no cases during winter (presumably fewer imports during northern summer). I'm predicting a high chance of an escape of B117 during our next winter, which is likely to be shit, but I'm certainly not looking at the US or UK with envy.</p>
<p>I'm confused about what you think is going on in NZ. We've eliminated the virus here, and are more-or-less successfully holding it off at the border. This is a centuries-old idea, it's not that complicated.</p>

<p>If that was the case there would been zero (0) nada cases all these months. There are still cases so either the test doesn't work or something circulates.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Then <strong>what's the point of requiring a PCR test</strong> before departure for travelers? You have a quarantine anyways. And what guarantees that the virus doesn't stay dormant for ages in cells. RNA viruses do that. It's a myth because you did a blood test or PCR that you will get the cell with the virus in, in every case. You won't. You may see something if it is active. And it's not always active.</p>
<p>So you cannot isolate as you think. A pathogen circulates in many ways via other organisms via materials etc. Low temperature do play a role for most because they are not trained and they do get extra stress. Like Europe or US it is. And it will carry on for few months.</p>

<p>We don't, currently. This has been debated in NZ for a while as an extra layer of security (think swiss cheese model), but until recently the winning argument has been that our quarantine is good enough and it's unfair on returnees who have difficulty getting a test. However, it is probably <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/434091/covid-19-nz-resident-overseas-worries-about-delays-due-to-pre-departure-test">about to be brought in for the US and UK only</a>, since the rates there are so high and it's not too hard to get a test.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you don't understand the situation in NZ, which I've tried to explain, or if you think that all the reports are lies and something else is happening. Could you try and clarify this, it feels like we're going in circles.</p>

        <p>Oh there are lots of lies and lots of ignorance for sure. The gov "experts" don't understand how a virus can circulate. A test is useful when symptoms arise perhaps to confirm a condition. It is useless if the virus is inactive, you can't necessarily see it.</p>
