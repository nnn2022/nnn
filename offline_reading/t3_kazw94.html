        <p>Because, believe it or not, all of them don't have a 100% chance of working, they just boost your chances of not catching it. That's like wondering why a seatbelt, airbag and brakes are there yet car accidents still happen. It's never gonna make it fully go away. In fact, im pretty sure this has been explained millions of times</p>

        <p>I'm saying that we should question everything. Seatbelts, airbags, breaks and turn lights aren't some holy grail, it's just that we know they work. </p>
<p>All of these measures are untested and at the same time, their effects can't be seen. And after six months, most of us think that it is worse for humans than just catching a virus so deadly you have to test that you have it.</p>

        <p>For the "The measures' affects can't be seen" thing, here is a comment I posted earlier, for masks and 6 feet:</p>
<p>"So do masks and 6 feet, there have been multiple studies that they help. In fact, you can test it out right now if you live in a place that is getting colder. Go outside without a mask on, and see how much breath you can see. Then put on a mask and see how much breath you can see. Surprise, it's a lot less, and goes to the sides, and not infront, protecting people when you're talking to them for example.</p>
<p>6 feet has effects too. Get another person for the experiment, go about 6 feet from each other, and see if you can get your breath to them whilebreathing nornally. And yet another surprise, you cant. And if you say that it doesn't matter because there's wind and such, see if you can blow out a candle by even blowing on it at 6 feet. Chances are, you can't."</p>
<p>For the other measures, e.g. lockdowns and quarantine, it keeps people in their homes, so that it reduces spread.</p>
<p>Edit: reddit is being mean and putting my replys on cooldown. I'll be back in like an hour to comment more.</p>

<p>This is the disconnect.  Normal people can’t tour those locations, and no one except trained personnel are allowed in the rooms.</p>

        <p>Except that people already have go into these places, doctors and nurses are getting furloughed. The hospitals are empty and shutting down all other things like heart disease or elective surgeries or sometimes even testing. What about all of the cancers and chronic illness that go untested and maybe gets worse?</p>

        <p>Speaking like someone that doesn’t work in the field.... we’re not furloughed where I practice.  Opposite that.  We can’t get enough people.  We now have 2 covid wards full of patients (the ICUs).</p>
<p>Of course other chronic illnesses are going undertreated.... what the hell do you want?  We’ve been extremely busy, and I’m tired of hearing plebs talk like they know, when they clearly don’t, about the reality of what’s going on.</p>
<p>Electives are shutting down because we can’t keep up with all these covid patients, and we’re being told how light the hospitals are and how were being laid off.  IE I’m being told what my reality is...  See how infuriating that is?</p>
<p>Edit:  and trust me, I wear masks for a living.  It’s not my preference.  I dont like lockdowns.  It’s boring.  But I’m also a realist, and I’ve seen too many 30, 40 yo either die or BARELY make it from this thing.</p>

<p>So it’s not ok.  But we can only care for so many goddamn people at once, and the most critical get priority, which means chronic conditions go undertreated.  You’re more than welcome to come help us.  I’ve been doing 60-70 a week for awhile now.</p>

        <p>And this is the reason normal people shouldn’t be involved in making policy.</p>
<p>ICUs need to be able to surge to 125% by law, most can do 150-200%. Then we can set up field hospitals (and actually use them). People underestimate what we’re able to actually flex to.</p>
<p>Lockdowns killed hospital businesses - leading to furloughed workers.</p>
<p>Now, hospitalization levels are largely the same across the board. There is no evidence social distancing or masks are doing any real impact. Danish mask study said 1.8% of mask wears got covid, 2.5% of non mask wearers got it. Only 0.7% difference.</p>
<p>But then how many covid cases actually require (and not simply scared into) hospitalization? 1%? 2%? Let’s take 1.5% times a 0.7% difference - our total surge could be no more than +0.00105%.</p>

        <p>The three are precautions. Masks help the most out of them. The vaccine is for people that don't want to take precautions. No vaccine is safe until work is done, vaccines are weakened or dead germs, scientists need to weaken then enough for the vaccine to work. The vaccine is currently experimental, so safety is not guaranteed. The virus is not 'world ending' lethal, but there have been deaths, and noone would like to die, so it's best that untill a vaccine is ready, the infected should be low in number because it is very difficult to cure this virus. Thats why we are urged to follow these precautions, so infection rates are low and healthy people are more. Its not because we are 'sheep'. Its because we care about humanity.</p>

        <p>Apparently, so far yes. But even after you've gotten the shot, and everything, it still won't prevent infection. It'll just lower the symptoms as a big maybe. </p>

        <p>But you would want your risk of infection as low as possible, so you don't potentionally die. That's why we have masks, 6 feet, lockdowns, and the vaccine.</p>
<p>And if you say that the chances of dieing to it are 98%, if you do get it, whether you just haven't gotten symptoms yet or are just asymptomatic, you can still pass it on to the high risk, such as the young, elderly, or people with weak immune systems.</p>

        <p>You're actually stupid if you think that. We have these measures because we've seen what happened when we didn't have them before we implemented them. Workplaces are a prime example.</p>
<p>Before the measures, if one person had it and didn't know, they could've passed it to another, and another, and another. Then those people infected infect more, and so on and so on. So let's say you, not even associated with that workplace, goes to the store to get that you need. Just one person who got infected from that workplace can infect you. You don't know immediately, so you just go on with your day.</p>
<p>Now let's say you live with someone in the high risk range. You can easily infect them, and they get it severe. Only then, when people realise what was going on, only then they implemented the measures. The damage has been done to your family member though, because now they are dead due to corona.</p>
<p>Edit: reddit is being mean and putting my replys on cooldown. I'll be back in like an hour to comment more.</p>

        <p>For a virus that for most is no worse than the common cold. And most of these measures are driving people to suicide depression. Even the high risk group, some of them are saying they can't live like this even if they benefit the most from the measures.</p>

        <p>People are literally dying, what do mean 'no worse than the common cold' ? I don't think these measures can lead to suicide. Think about it, would you kill yourself if you couldn't leave the house? If you say that's house arrest, think more. You can talk to whoever you want through your phone, you can order groceries and whatever you need from amazon and stuff, earn and do your job, basically do whatever you want but from the comfort of your home. Who would want to kill themselves in this situation? No one is forcing you to walk around without a mask and spread a disease, just stay the fuck at home. These masks don't protect your life, but they protect someone else's life. If soldiers can survive tight, restricting clothing on thier body for weeks, in pretty sure you can survive a 15 minute walk in Walmart with a piece of cloth on your face.</p>
