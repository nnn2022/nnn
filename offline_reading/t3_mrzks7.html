    <strong>People are stupid.</strong>
    <p><p>I just can't withstand the brain capacity of some people. People just use your brain. Look at other perspectives. Don't follow sheep. I feel like we are doomed and the great reset is going to happen. I try to warn everyone but everyone thinks I'm crazy. I'm hopeless.</p></p>

        <p>You actually need to apply for a pass to leave with a "legitimate purpose", and they can deny you.</p>
<p>If you are an Australian citizen or a permanent resident you cannot leave Australia due to COVID-19 restrictions unless you have an exemption. You can¬†apply online¬†but you must meet at least one of the following:</p>
<p>your travel is as part of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak, including the provision of aid¬†</p>

        <p>Hang on in there. We have a lot of work to do, but more people are waking up. Part of the propaganda is to make you feel that their 'great reset' or 'new normal' is inevitable. Don't buy into it. Once somebody's eyes are open, there's no turning back. There are millions of us and our number is only getting bigger.</p>

        <p>Yeah. My soul is shattered tbh. Folks are willing to suffer the pain of oppression, but not the pain of freedom. Most don't care about totalitarianism, some love it. Those of us against it seem disparate. It's tough to recgonise how people are willing to utterly control others and call themselves good. It's tough that their political and emotional literacy is stuck at the same level I experienced as a teenager. I keep trying to remind myself that trying to get people to think is "like showing a dog a card trick."</p>
<p>Trying to figure out how to find happiness within myself. I know what my boundaries are, I know what my principles and values are. I work hard on self awareness. That's a lot to make life worth living and dying for. The gift and curse of awareness. Help recognition that there  is so much to love. Nature is still the same, and there's more of that than there is of humans.</p>
<p>How's your self-care? You looking after yourself? I know it's besides the point of what's happening, but it still pays to take super good care of yourself.</p>

        <p>I'm with you. I am so frusterated. And the thing is, it's the smartest people who are the most far gone. Harvard, Yale, law students, all of them just buy into the narrative and lack any and all critical thinking. Ben Shapiro is probably the last critical thinker to ever graduate an Ivy.</p>

        <p>I can relate to how you feel. I find it very disheartening as well. It seems like people are under a spell - a mass delusion. I take solace in spaces like these, in the few people I know who are questioning the narrative, and in my spiritual practices.</p>

        <p>First of all they don‚Äôt want to stop wars. People profit off those. All governments don‚Äôt have to agree with each other, just a few major players who have the most influence. If a few smaller countries don‚Äôt play along, or lower level bureaucrats are unaware, it doesn‚Äôt matter.</p>
<p>That, and corporations + tech billionaires like Bill Gates have enough money to pay off whoever they want. He‚Äôs said multiple times he would never run for office because he is more influential right now. Money talks.</p>

        <p>Well, for example, a year ago we were told the case fatality rate (CFR) of covid was 1%. 'Ten times more deadly than flu' was the mantra put about by governments, public health officials and media. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768536/">The lastest studies</a> show a CFR of 0.15%, which is one and a half times more deadly than regular flu or the same as a bad flu season. Yet the same governments, public health officials and media still act like it's the bubonic plague.</p>
<p>PCR tests, the reason for the huge numbers of 'cases' have been shown to <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">not be fit for purpose.</a> They were never intended to be used for diagnosis and they give huge numbers of flase positive results. <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2021/03/no_author/the-who-confirms-that-the-covid-19-pcr-test-is-flawed-estimates-of-positive-cases-are-meaningless/">Even the WHO has said this</a> yet they're still used.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695">'Asymptomatic' transmission</a> has been shown <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4851">not to be a significant driver of infection</a>. Yet the healthy must remain in lockdown with the sick.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf">the WHO changed their guidance for the recording of deaths</a> worldwide in April last year. <a href="https://dr-no.co.uk/2021/01/30/ode-to-the-death-certificate/">Deaths which would previously have been classified as cancer, renal failure, etc</a> are now listed as covid.</p>
<p>The fact that governments and media have carried on regardless, ramping up the fear at every opportunity and keeping us masked up and locked down is ample evidence for brainwashing, I think.</p>
