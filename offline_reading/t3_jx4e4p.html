        <p>If it was so serious why would she quit her job just because some people didn’t believe it was as serious? Or was it “too stressful” which also would mean that she is too selfish to actually care about others but wanted to look like a hero. Makes no sense.</p>

        <p>Yup! This story just sounds so exaggerated. My sister is a nurse and I can read through her bs. She’s the biggest hypocrite when it comes to this entire situation but now she’s easing up and admitting the craziness of it all.</p>

        <p>Exactly! First, it’s hospitals denying people care who test positive or have COVID, and now it’s nurses that refuse to take COVID patients. What is the point of your job then?!</p>

        <p>When you’re a healthcare provider, part of your job is dealing with patients with highly contagious, and sometimes very deadly (lol not covid), diseases. When I was thinking of nursing school that’s the first thing that was pointed out to me, decided that wasn’t the way to go. Every nurse took the job knowing they’d be around those with communicable diseases and I’m so sick of them whining about this. I never had a nurse quit or complain when I was in the ER with the flu. They just love to eat up the attention and me me me lately and I’m over it. Shut up and do your job or quit and let someone else do it. This “putting healthcare workers on a pedestal” thing needs to stop. They are there for when people get sick and now they’re mad people are getting sick?</p>

        <p>I couldn’t have said it better. This is part of their job. Did they forget that? And flu season/working in an ICU, hospice, ER will always be traumatic, but that is exactly what they signed up for.</p>

        <p>One thing going for her in terms of her career is that 98% of flu cases are down ;) If what she wrote about her experiences and from her caring about her patients maybe she should not have quit and should have continued to show compassion and help her fellow human being</p>
