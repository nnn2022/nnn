        <p>I still wouldn’t call myself “anti-vax” but I am opposed to this current vaccine. That being said, I now lean more towards the refusal of all vaccines because of one factor: how deep does this corruption go? Do we really need all the vaccines children are required to take? What vaccines are being administered for profit vs. pure safety? I have lost all faith in the health industry because of this pandemic and because of an unrelated experience I recently had.</p>

        <p>I've come to the same conclusion. I've developed a bunch of autoimmune conditions in the last 10 years and in the last 10 years I've begun taking yearly flu vaccines and never connected the two. I'm going to stop taking flu vaccines and see how my body does.</p>

        <p>literally everyone I've met who is anti vax is because they are uncomfortable with stuff like aluminum and mercury being in them, or the think that the schedule for children is too much too soon for them to handle... or are just opposed to them being mandated. I hate the astroturf campaign that began online a couple YEARS before the new flu hit because it's such a straw man. No concerns are addressed, they're just called AnTi-ScIeNce... which seems like a very non-scientific rebuttal</p>

<p><strong>What's wrong with Universal Basic Income?</strong>: If everybody has X amount of dollars a month, nobody does. That's because prices adjust to this new reality. However, if the government takes your allowance from you, you're left artificially poorer. Rather than setting you free, this makes you dependent.</p>

<p><strong>So, what's so bad about it?</strong> A cashless society implies digital money. Cash has the benefit of being untraceable. Digital currency means your account can be hacked, your transactions are traced, taxes are unavoidable and your account can be shut down in full Chinese-social-credit-style. They know who has guns (and automatically ban people from buying guns if they're deemed "white supremacists"), what means of transport they use (therefore; where they are at the moment), it is a tracking system and all of your money will be in the hands of whoever controls the system (in this case, the government. Politicians). Closing the "financial inclusion gap" means everybody will have a bank account. One world currency implies one world central bank. Whoever controls that bank controls the economy of the entire world. Printing money would have very little impact on the world economy, which would allow for politicians to have infinite money. There would be no competing currency, so no one would shift to another one; allowing the politician to print as much as needed. These articles barely mention the problem of the government tracking every single transaction.</p>

<p>&rt; 2. Say hello to your pet “Crispy”: CRISPR (Continuous Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats) is a biochemist’s way of saying that we can cheaply and reliably edit genes. Today, cat lovers crave exotic breeds, such as the toyger. Tomorrow, your family pet may be a genetically engineered tiger, yet the size of a common housecat. Should regulatory bodies ban CRISPR technologies in humans, underground labs will flourish worldwide, as parents aim to eliminate congenital genetic disorders or give their kids a heritable advantage in school and life. This will create new disparities and stigmas. Criminality and human trafficking will take on a new dimension of insidiousness when genetic identity no longer can be confirmed. 4. Ads – a necessary evil: Someone has to pay for all of this change, and it is still going to be us in the form of targeted advertising. Your communications device, or whatever replaces functions currently served by today’s cellphone, may be free or heavily subsidized. But you won’t be able to skip the latest immersive advertising, at least without paying a fee. You will be more connected than ever before, though advertisers will find clever ways to influence your behaviour, based on the same biometric technology that monitors your health. 5. The age of implantables: As our world changes, scientists believe that humans’ brains will continue to get bigger, our lifespans will increase, and our cultures will continue to evolve and merge as we adapt to new environments. Today, you can have 20/10 vision with LASIK. Tomorrow, you may add infrared zoom lenses to your vision making 20/1 vision possible (hawks are estimated to have 20/5 or 20/4 vision). Today, we have wearable devices that can detect magnetic north and give a SONAR-like capability (useful for the visually impaired). Tomorrow, you will meet your “always-on” virtual assistant. Eventually, our descendants will be unrecognizable. </p>

<p>&rt; We’re entering the era of the “Internet of Bodies”: collecting our physical data via a range of devices that can be implanted, swallowed or worn. The result is a huge amount of health-related data that could improve human wellbeing around the world, and prove crucial in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. But a number of risks and challenges must be addressed to realize the potential of this technology, from privacy issues to practical hurdles. After the Internet of Things, which transformed the way we live, travel and work by connecting everyday objects to the Internet, it’s now time for the Internet of Bodies. This means collecting our physical data via devices that can be implanted, swallowed or simply worn, generating huge amounts of health-related information. In 2017, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration approved the first use of digital pills in the United States. Digital pills contain tiny, ingestible sensors, as well as medicine. Once swallowed, the sensor is activated in the patient’s stomach and transmits data to their smartphone or other devices. They argue for a so-called “right to reasonable inferences”, meaning the right to have your data used only for reasonable, socially acceptable inferences. This would involve setting standards on whether and when inferring certain information from a person’s data, including the state of their present or future health, is socially acceptable or overly invasive.</p>

        <p>Pt 2:- again I'm quoting an older post....</p>
<p>&rt; In June 2020, Klaus Schwab, who founded the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 1971 and is currently its CEO, described the three core components of the Great Reset.[2] The first includes creating conditions for a "stakeholder economy"; improving policies and agreements on taxes, regulations, fiscal policies and trade to result in "fairer outcomes".[2] The second component addresses how the large-scale pandemic spending programs with private investments and pension funds could improve on the old system by building one that is more "resilient, equitable and sustainable" over the long term by "building green urban infrastructure and creating incentives for industries to improve their track record on environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics". The third component of a Great Reset agenda is to "harness the innovations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution" for the public good.[2] A July 2020 non-fiction by Schwab and economist Thierry Malleret, develops the plan in more detail. In one of the Great Reset Dialogues, John Kerry and other members of a WEF dialogue discussed how to rebuild the "social contract" in a post-COVID world.[15] According to Prince Charles, the economic recovery must put the world on a path to sustainability, which would include carbon pricing. Prince Charles emphasized that the private sector would be the main drivers of the plan.[1] The market should adapt to the current reality by aiming for fairer results, ensuring that investments are aimed at mutual progress including accelerating ecologically friendly investments, and to start a fourth industrial revolution, creating digital economic and public infrastructure.[1] According to Klaus Schwab, they would not change the economic system, but rather improve it to what he considers to be "responsible capitalism".</p>

<p>&rt; They released the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics: nonfinancial metrics and disclosures that will be added (on a voluntary basis) to companies’ annual reporting in the next two to three years, making it possible to measure their progress over time.</p>
<p>&rt; Doing so requires answering questions such as: What is the gender pay gap in company X? How many people of diverse backgrounds were hired and promoted? What progress has the company made toward reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions? How much did the company pay in taxes globally and per jurisdiction? And what did the company do to hire and train employees?
For the past 30 to 50 years, the neoliberalist ideology has increasingly prevailed in large parts of the world. This approach centers on the notion that the market knows best, that the “business of business is business,” and that government should refrain from setting clear rules for the functioning of markets. Those dogmatic beliefs have proved wrong. But fortunately, we are not destined to follow them.</p>

<p>&rt; The Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere. The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which set out a 15-year plan to achieve the Goals. With just under ten years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, world leaders at the SDG Summit in September 2019 called for a Decade of Action and delivery for sustainable development, and pledged to mobilize financing, enhance national implementation and strengthen institutions to achieve the Goals by the target date of 2030, leaving no one behind. The UN Secretary-General called on all sectors of society to mobilize for a decade of action on three levels: global action to secure greater leadership, more resources and smarter solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals; local action embedding the needed transitions in the policies, budgets, institutions and regulatory frameworks of governments, cities and local authorities; and people action, including by youth, civil society, the media, the private sector, unions, academia and other stakeholders, to generate an unstoppable movement pushing for the required transformations.</p>

Shopping is a distant memory in the city of 2030, whose inhabitants have cracked clean energy and borrow what they need on demand. It sounds utopian, until she mentions that her every move is tracked and outside the city live swathes of discontents, the ultimate depiction of a society split in two.</p>
<p>&rt; Once in awhile I get annoyed about the fact that I have no real privacy. No where I can go and not be registered. I know that, somewhere, everything I do, think and dream of is recorded. I just hope that nobody will use it against me.</p>

<p>&rt; Chaos, War or a New World Order? is the name of a pamphlet advocating for world government by feminist Rosika Schwimmer and Lola Maverick Lloyd. Rosika Schwimmer had a very active political career; she was accused of being a socialist and also a spy for the Germans during WW1. She worked as a minister for the Swiss government and was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her manifesto in favor of world government. Lola Maverick Lloyd was openly socialist.</p>

<p>"The New World Order" by H.G. Wells is a work in which he states his view for the future. He envisions a "scientific", worldwide socialist state, in which everybody "trusts the experts"; a technocracy in which scientists, engineers and other specialists decide the course of humanity. Of course, this utopia would totally respect the rights of man...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt; Collectivisation means the handling of the common affairs of mankind by a common control responsible to the whole community. It means the suppression of go-as-you-please in social and economic affairs just as much as in international affairs. It means the frank abolition of profit-seeking and of every device by which human beings contrive to be parasitic on their fellow man. It is the practical realisation of the brotherhood of man through a common control.</p>
<p>&rt;The new and complete Revolution can be defined in a very few words. It is (a) outright world-socialism, scientifically planned and directed, plus (b) a sustained insistence upon law, law based on a fuller, more jealously conceived resentment of the personal Rights of Man, plus (c) the completest freedom of speech, criticism and publication, and sedulous expansion of the educational organisation to the ever-growing demands of the new order</p>
<p>&rt;There will be no day of days then when a new world order comes into being. Step by step and here and there it will arrive, and even as it comes into being it will develop fresh perspectives, discover unsuspected problems and go on to new adventures. No man, no group of men, will ever be singled out as its father or founder. For its maker will be not this man nor that man nor any man but Man, that being who is in some measure in every one of us. World order will be, like science, like most inventions, a social product, an innumerable number of personalities will have lived fine lives, pouring their best into the collective achievement.</p>
<p>This book would later inspire the UN declaration of "human rights". However, this was not his only work regarding this beautiful "utopia". He had others like The Open Conspiracy, The Shape of things to come. H.G. Wells was close with Winston Churchill, who apparently coincided with him on many points (including welfare state and eugenics) and was a personal fan of his work.</p>
<p>&rt; Undeterred by this examination, the French Revolution gave rise to ideas which led beyond the ideas of the entire old world order. The revolutionary movement which began in 1789 in the Cercle Social, [31] which in the middle of its course had as its chief representatives Leclerc and Roux, and which finally with Babeuf’s conspiracy was temporarily defeated, gave rise to the communist idea which Babeuf’s friend Buonarroti re-introduced in France after the Revolution of 1830. This idea, consistently developed, is the idea of the new world order.</p>

        <p>I don’t say this a whole lot, but IRL, I am quite openly anti-vax except in a handful of cases (polio and, in some situations, DTaP being the commonly encountered ones). Frankly, I never quite saw, until I understood the overarching plan of the elites, why it is so taboo to be anti-vax, or why it automatically makes you a nutjob in most people’s eyes. That said, thank you for posting all this information! Perhaps if people are better informed, they’ll be less likely to think of people like you and me as crazy.</p>

        <p>The only doctor (actually former doctor) on that list I recognize is Andrew Wakefield. Hopefully some of these are more credible than him. You should probably take the "Dr." from in front of his name. I'd actually just take him off the list entirely--he makes you look looney. I'm not saying he's wrong, by the way. I'm not in a position to judge that.</p>
