        <p>&rt;Professors Martin Bazant and John Bush said that the risk of Wuhan coronavirus exposure indoors is the same regardless of distance – even if people wear masks. This is because respiratory droplets in the air tend to rise, travel and descend somewhere in an enclosed space. The two researchers explained that whether people situate themselves six feet or 60 feet apart, they still face the same risk of contracting the pathogen.</p>

        <p>You are right. But I cannot hide from it. Keeping myself locked away does more damage to my body. I know a few people who have caught it and they are now fine.</p>

        <p>Totes agree. I know people who have fully recovered and people who have not. My grandpa does not seem to have, he has always had a sharp mind and now he is very dulled and has a short memory. Just a few years ago he fully recovered after falling down and being stuck for 24 hours. He is a strong guy, but this leveled him and is not likely to return. </p>
<p>I know a couple young people that still have bad lingering symptoms, but most have recovered.</p>
<p>Personally, as someone with a super fucking rare vascular disease, I am worried about clots. Bad for regular people, worse for me. </p>
<p>I didn't stay locked up, but I used my time differently and safely. Masks, no big gatherings, etc etc. I run a business through markets and have to meet a lot of people now if I want to make money, so I really dislike it when people come into the market spiting the covid rules. Ironically I am the only brother of 3 who didn't get it. Nor did my wife or kid, but my brother's partners did. </p>
<p>Idk, shit is wack. Things could have been done differently and people could have been less pissy. I am not gonna fault either too much, it was a pandemic and things were unknown. 
I am just glad we did something. And I hope we better prepare for the future. And please  if you do not have any major issues with the vaccine, get a shot. It could help someone like me, your favorite tie dyed cookie guy at the farmers market yo.</p>

        <p>The spacing crap never made sense, especially in lines. If the person in front of you moves, and they were breathing COVID particles in the spot they were standing, and then you walk forward to the spot they were standing, you're now inhaling their old air.</p>

        <p>I guess many already knew this, but wouldn't then the correct mitigation process be to ban indoor gatherings? I don't think many here would agree with that. Instead likely to just allow everything, no? All indoor gathering  etc. But that doesn't seem smart either. </p>
<p>There were a lot of issues with the pandemic, but with this info, to me, the solution would be to ban all indoor gatherings and disallowing indoor shopping for temporary periods of time. </p>
<p>And maybe someone here can help  but how about countries that got the virus under control? What did NZ do correct? Did they just simply shut down the borders and that was really all that was good (along with great tracking and identification)?</p>
