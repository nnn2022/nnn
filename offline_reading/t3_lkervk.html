    <p><p>The second I posted this, I got a permanent ban email.  It was in reply to someone saying that possibly permanently altered DNA was not a risk with mRNA vaccines.</p>

<p>&rt;Tell that to the University of Michigan - risk is currently thought to be small, but it's there:</p>

<p>&rt;Theoretically, there is a way for your body to convert mRNA into DNA, but only if your cells manage to hijack proteins encoded by a naturally occurring “jumping gene” called a LINE-1 retrotransposon. This gene tells the cell how to make a protein called reverse transcriptase, which can “read” mRNA and churn out a stretch of DNA. But the chances of this happening are extremely small. And even if it does, and the new DNA gets integrated into your existing DNA, the chances that this would cause negative consequences are even smaller.</p></p>
