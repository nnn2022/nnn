    <strong>During all this "pandemic" not once I've worn a mask</strong>
    <p><p>And I'll try my damnedest to keep it that way. I'm not participating in their insane rituals. I refuse. I <em>do</em> refuse.</p>
<p>I hope my humanity, my health and my heart survives this.</p>
<p>It's so much easier to <em>bend the knee</em>. I can't say I won't do it ever, but I'll try. I <em>will</em> try. That's all we can do. To try. Try hard, harder and then some.</p></p>

        <p>Because of the masks you get less oxygen. That downregulates your immune system and makes you susceptible to otherwise harmless infections.</p>

        <p>No can you actually cite it? You’re sounding like every other leftist that says “oh do your own research for my claim”. Believe me I think all this shit is ridiculous and I think it’s a psyop from China to destabilize the world for their benefit (see here: https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/china-covid-lockdown-propaganda), but both my folks are in the medical field, late 40’s, and they wore masks with an O2 SAT monitor to see if there was any changes (not some gimmick Apple Watch or Fitbit monitor, medical grade equipment) and there was no change over the course of nearly 2 hours. Now I get they aren’t representative of everyone but I’m curious where this comes from, some of my older aunts and uncles say they can’t breathe well with masks but all of them have heavy smoking history, and I just think we need better more solid arguments for ditching the masks, cus the whole breathing trouble thing jus seems like a reach to me</p>

        <p>My main arguments against mask wearing:</p>
<p>1) Research hasn’t established that community wide use of masks lowers infection rates, hence why the WHO, CDC, Surgeon General, etc. all explicitly advised against it until just a few months ago.</p>
<p>2) The current policies have devastating short-term and long-term impacts on public health that need to be considered. </p>

        <p>Translation: I don’t have anything to cite, I jus made the claim in thin air and would hope you didn’t question it. And what do you mean there’s no benefit? Nothing of what I said would change the govt opinion but I’m not asking what they think, I asked for a simple study or source that says mask wearing depletes blood oxygen level. The benefit would be if there’s cited and studied sources, then we have something tangible to try and convince the normies, that’s always been the goal is convincing others not the govt</p>

        <p>See, that's the issue, because I haven't been able to find any information to verify your statement, leading me to the belief that it's probably untrue. I did, however, want to see if there was some kind of new revelation or previous information that I missed, so I asked you for a source. Evidently, there wasn't.</p>

        <p>So you do not matter as a source of wisdom for yourself. If you figure out something but no paper confirms it, it must be wrong. If someone else figures out something, he must be wrong if he doesn't cite papers. Go get therapy.</p>

        <p>&rt;you do not matter as a source of wisdom for yourself</p>
<p>What does this even mean?</p>
<p>Ambiguous statements aside, how exactly did you "figure out" the supposed fact that masks cause you to receive less oxygen and weaken your immune system? That's not exactly an obvious observation, something like that would take controlled study and proper equipment in order to test and confirm. You'd also need to repeat that study on a vast number of people and ensure that your results were statistically significant, and that there wasn't just an anomaly with the first person tested in terms of oxygen output or something.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, yeah, if you don't cite a paper that followed some kind of reputable methodology, describe the methodology that you used to determine your beliefs, or provide some sort of reasoning why something like that wouldn't be necessary, why exactly should your belief stand up against actual documented research? You're not automatically wrong because it's not from a research paper, but simply because your claim is outlandish compared to a common perception, you need highly compelling evidence in order to convince anybody that your perspective is true. You didn't provide that, so I asserted that your belief was probably untrue.</p>

        <p>I'm not really understanding, why do you even use reddit, if not to convince somebody of your perspective? Why did you even respond to my comments? You're correct, I mean, you're wasting your time on reddit, and you don't gain anything from convincing me of anything. Nobody does, it's a way to pass time. You're kind of stating the obvious.</p>
<p>Obviously you aren't forced to argue the point, but why even make one on a discussion thread if you aren't willing to argue it?</p>
<p>That being said, I wasn't begging you to try to convince me of your perspective - at this point, I'm quite sure that you don't have a source to back up your claim. All I was doing in my previous comment was responding to your reasoning regarding the need of research papers in order to verify a particular claim. </p>
<p>It seems you aren't really willing to debate any of the points I've made or issue a proper response, so I think I'll leave the discussion here. I hope you have a nice day.</p>

<p>here is a relevant and timely <a href="https://www.ericpetersautos.com/2020/10/13/it-began-with-saaaaaaaaaaaafety-seats/">article</a> on how these things start</p>

        <p>I'll give that article a read tomorrow, but I think I agree with you in overall: the mask hill is as good as any to die on. At this point we've already given up to them too much hills, it's almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right: give them an inch and they'll take miles. This will <em>never</em> stop if we acquiesce to it.</p>

        <p>Thank you for doing the same. I only really found out about this place when someone used my email to set up an account and troll. I haven't even verified this account yet, and I have no idea why I'm able to comment.</p>
<p>Anyway, with all that said, I honestly can't agree. I know there's a lot of people taking things out of context, people saying masks and vaccines will solve everything, etc etc. It's all bull. And that all comes from the lack of knowing what we're dealing with, and containing it as best as we could. We flattened the curve, but on false hopes and science, and now we're increasing in cases. </p>
<p>I won't say everyone must wear masks, I won't say they're the cure, but them along with regular preventive measures (things we should already be doing like washing hands, regular cleaning/bathing, etc) all help. If our government would stop screwing around, we'd know what needs to be done to stop this, but it's all turned political.</p>
<p>Believe what you want, I won't force a change, but don't think we're all "out to get you," I wear a mask out of respect for others, otherwise, I want this thing off my face.</p>

        <p>I mean, if you want to think that, go for it, I won't stop you. I feel I'm doing the right thing, but if you're not sick and actively coughing on someone, then it's not really right to say anything. I don't agree with most people in this sub, but then again, I hate how some people think the ONLY right thing is 100% compliance. There's a difference between doing what you think is right, and bowing down in front of the CDC/WHO, etc.</p>

        <p>I have because I can't buy food or enter the hospital for treatment (for something which is actually serious) without one but I won't wear one unless I am compelled by necessity to do so.</p>
<p>I took a walk through Manila the other day - I am the only person who feels like this, apparently. Every single person I saw was by themselves, with no-one near them, and yet, there was that useless fucking mask.</p>

        <p>I'm not from US. I'm from Europe and until now I've managed to brush all this nonsense aside somehow. Right now, however, it seems that shit's going south very fast. TPTB are ramping up (so-called) second wave aggressively.</p>
<p>I have <em>very</em> huge advantage of being disabled (not on wheelchair, but still visible). Good luck for those cucks who'll doubtlessly try to write a ticket for me at some point (and good sleep at night to them as well).</p>
<p>I've <em>never in my life</em> imagined that my disability will become an advantage, but here we are. And that only shows how fucked up our world is.</p>
<p>What the <em>fuck</em> has happened to the world we live in? I have no idea. But I <em>will</em> resist it for the time being. I hope that our collective resitance will be enough. If not, then that's that. It <em>is</em> very probable that this is the hill I die on.</p>

        <p>Where I live we are about four months in on the mask mandate. The first month it was pretty much only my wife and I without masks in any given store. We would get stares and reminders but never any hostility. Now a few months later when we go to the same places half of the people we see have no mask and no one cares at all.</p>

        <p>When I goes to the club with my college friends I refuse wearing a mask and they're not mask wearers either. We've a good excuse to do so because of many people there relies on lip reading. It would've been ableist of society to demand people to wear these masks. The owner of the room we're using are fine with it too. We're also refusing wearing mask in school, but my teachers are masking up and many of us can't read their lips then. They won't use clear mask 50% of the time because of they claim it makes them uncomfortable and silly.</p>
