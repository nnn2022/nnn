    <strong>Can't find a single midwife, birth center, or hospital that will allow me to bring my husband and child to appointments/birth</strong>
    <p><p>My last child was born at a nice, family-oriented birth center that focuses on natural birth with minimal separation from baby. I wanted to have that same experience for my next pregnancy. I've set up my next first appointment for this same birth center. Today is my appointment and they JUST threw these lockdown rules at me (no mention of these rules on their website or in prior communications).</p>
<ul>
<li>Can't use the waiting room. We must sit in our car in the parking lot until they call us in.</li>
<li>Not allowed to bring visitors to almost every appointment</li>
<li>Not allowed to bring CHILDREN to ANY appointment</li>
<li>No visitors allowed during ultrasounds</li>
</ul>
<p>And we still have to pay full price for this significantly reduced service.</p>
<p>I'm sure they have more hidden anti-family rules like this. I'm so furious and feel hopeless about this all. I'm hormonal and not taking this well. I feel like it's futile. Our men don't seem to be publicly and tangibly standing up against these restrictions. I can count on one hand the amount of maskless people I have seen out and about since June, and I refuse to wear one for any reason. I feel so alone in this.</p>
<p>My research into midwives around me has returned nothing positive either. Most have anti-family lockdown rules on their website, even for home births. Many are too far away to serve our family. </p>
<p>I know there HAS to be someone around here who won't comply with this lockdown bullshit and allow our family to stay together during these important appointments and birth. I just don't know where to look and feel lost.</p>
<p>Can anyone relate? Does anyone have any suggestions? Anything helps.</p></p>

        <p>Yes!! I can relate! I'm 28 weeks pregnant with #2 and so depressed my son can't be involved. When I got pregnant I was sure this would be done with by the time I was ready to give birth. Unfortunately it seems as if I was quite wrong about that. </p>
<p>I wanted so bad for my son to be with me at some of the big appointments (ultrasounds, maybe to hear the heartbeat a few times) and he's not allowed at any fucking one. I wanted him to be with me while I labored/shortly after I gave birth and he will not be allowed to visit at all. I cried for days. I researched home births but like you, I don't have many options available and I don't even know where I'd begin.</p>
<p>And then don't even get me started on the masks. When my doctor broke the news my son wouldnt be allowed to see me at all, she also told me they would really prefer me to wear a mask while laboring. She said if I can't I can't but most women don't have an issue. Mask while I'm laboring? Are you nuts? </p>
<p>I've come to terms with just giving birth at the hospital and coming home immediately after. I'm not dealing with all this crap after giving birth. I'll come home where my family can visit like normal. This is #2 so I'm prepared this time. I'm not a scared first time mom like before. I will sign out ama if necessary.</p>

        <p>They can’t force you to wear it either. That’s 100% illegal. They will lie and say you have to, but they CANNOT force you to wear it. If they try, start screaming and call 911</p>

<p>I donate plasma twice a week. Sometimes I have to take my mask off so I can breathe. I start getting lightheaded. I don't know the fuck they expect women to give birth while wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I'm facing similar challenges. At the moment I'm most worried about being forced to wear a mask during labor. I already have trouble breathing in the mask, especially when I'm pregnant, and I just don't see how I will be able to get through labor with my breathing obstructed.</p>
<p>Last I heard my husband is allowed there for the birth, though not the appointments. It's impossible to plan ahead though because our overlords seem to randomly change the rules every few weeks.</p>

        <p>Congratulations! That's so Awesome! Good for you for not wearing a mask. I don't really have anything helpful for you on finding a midwife who will do a home birth, but that would be ideal. Even if on their website they blather social distancing BS, when you get them in your home I'm guessing you would be more empowered since they would be on your turf. perhaps try some local religious fundamentalists and mention that you are looking for a midwife who will protect your birthright. Have you read Ina May's Spiritual Midwifery? The medical establishment really cannot be trusted at all right now, you may want to forgo any involvement of a formal birth center. </p>
<p>Thank you for having a baby, when you snuggle it's tiny little head you'll be the luckiest lady in the world. </p>
<p>Also, you've done it before, you can do it again, with or without the help of the medical establishment. People accidentally have unattended births all the time.  It's a beautiful thing. Good Luck.</p>

<p>And going the religious route could be helpful. My neighbors are very religious and we are good friends. I will see if they have any suggestions for me.</p>

        <p>I’ve gone to meet with several birthing centers and they tell me all their COVID rules then I say “Now what’s the real rules, what are you’re actually going to follow?” After I ask they usually tell me what they can do for me, usually no masks and husband can come in. I don’t know what state you’re in but my state is a bit more relaxed so maybe that’s it.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure where you are in the country, but I found one in Denver! We sat down prepared to wear our masks at every appointment, and she said you can take those off if you’re like. I told her my mother was terrified of me pursuing a home birth because of her prior birth trauma and she told me that my family, not just my husband, could come to any visit with me. All the others wanted to do virtual appointments, I don’t know how you properly monitor mother and baby virtually. I’m sorry you’re having such a hard time finding a good provider. Wishing you luck in your search!</p>

        <p>That's wonderful for you! It always feels good to find a flicker of sanity in the sea of craziness.</p>
<p>And yes, the virtual appointments are a sorry excuse for a real appointment.</p>

        <p>make every person trying to enforce that bullshit tell it to you, your husband and your child personally and explicitly.  these people are accustomed to negotiating with newborn infants.  the policies written on their website and repeated over the phone don't matter-- they can't and won't even try it to your face.  just check in as usual, shake hands and hold eye contact firmly as usual, leave (+1 healthy baby good luck congratulations!) as usual.</p>
