    <strong>We’re done for</strong>
    <p><p>Just spent an hour reading the comment section of the thread of the old lady getting an egg smashed on her head by the kid....and my god am I fucking horrified...the fact that grown adult men can exist and not work, be infantilized by Star Wars, Disney, and anime, and sit behind a screen all day making death threats and threats of violence against people who disagree with them is fucking sickening.</p>
<p>The internet has destroyed the entire world. Nothing is wild on this earth anymore. We’ve moved so far from what we are. World governments are pushing for a worldwide technological enslavement grid system and this is what we’ve become. Psychological terrorism is at an all time high. There is no resistance. </p>
<p>We’ve come so far. Millenia spent fighting oppressive world governments. And now People are begging for enslavement and oppression, and threatening those who speak out. If you stand up against it they paint you as the oppressor. </p>
<p>I’ve been on reddit for 8 years, I’ll be deleting this app by the end of the day. I don’t really want to come back. I’m truly disgusted by humanity.</p>

        <p>This is actually relevant. OP, there are Indian and Israeli troll farms paid for by political donors. I'm singling them out because I can provide the receipts:</p>
<p>https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-kamala-harris-got-big-social-media-boost-indian-troll-farms-1544047</p>
<p>https://forward.com/news/388259/shadowy-israeli-app-turns-american-jews-into-foot-soldiers-in-online-war/</p>
<p>China is clearly heavily invested in this too by way of corporate investments such as Reddit itself </p>
<p>https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18216134/reddit-tencent-investment-deal-memes-amount-winnie-the-pooh-tank-man-china</p>
<p>Sure there are millenials and Zoomers that have drank the Kool Aid from all the propaganda out there, but you're definitely focusing on a hyper magnified online minority and people who mostly wouldn't speak this way in person.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of other things coming out from Maricopa County and Fulton County. 200k votes eliminated in 1 and 25% false in the other. My intent is not to make this political, but covid is being used both politically and tyrannical where it can and the big orgs and powers of the world are doing their damndest to make us fight each other and poor, instead of them. In some ways it's working, but in the long haul this is absolutely winnable. </p>
<p>Take a break if you need to, any time you want to, but never think online is indicative of real life.</p>
<p>When everything is censored and normal concepts are deleted insulted shadow banned and removed, it sure feels that way when you're being viciously verbally attacked.</p>
<p>The media, big brother, big tech, big pharma, troll farms, foreign countries, some useful idiots and criminals, and the corporate cabal which includes mods of compromised subreddits are all making sure you feel alone.</p>
<p>But go outside and actually talk to people and its quite different.</p>
<p>It feels like nobody is on your side because the social media companies ARE MAKING SURE OF THAT. They WANT you to feel isolated. </p>
<p>It's nowhere near 50/50, I guarantee you the number is far more on the side of sanity a everyday that number gets bigger as people realize they were lied to.</p>

<p>There's a way to mention a reddit user so he sees it in his inbox, but I'm not sure how that works bc I use a separate app. Hope he sees this. I hate when anyone demoralizes people off the internet.</p>

        <p>Be fair this is an old tactic. It’s not a partisan argument. The reality of our modern situation can be found with companies like Cambridge Analytica. These people on both sides are targets of sophisticated 5th generation psychological warfare. They are legit creations and they don’t even know it. These companies have so much data on each person it’s incredibly easy to create narratives to control both sides of the base. The only real “critical thinkers” are the ones who understand all this division is a distraction. Real issues are Blackrock buying all America’s real estate, South American natives having their land stolen so rare earth minerals can be mined. African and Indian farm land are taken over by corporations. But yea masks vs no masks are what Americans care about</p>

        <p>We need to repeal the "Good Samaritan" Clause of Section 230. If you read it carefully, you'll understand that the clause was put in there with great foresight to where we're heading. It doesn't protect free speech. Quite the contrary, it protects tech companies from being sued for infringing on free speech and gives them indiscriminate control over what they choose to censor.</p>

        <p>Great point. Before I really understood Section 230 a friend suggested a "tech bill of rights". I mentioned this idea while talking on FB w/ a left-leaning friend. He then proceeded to say "that's what Net Neutrality legistlation was going to do" (presumably among many other things).</p>
<p>Really though, it's just a matter of revising Section 230 as you describe, by removing that "Good Samaritan" clause. No need to make it more complex and give lobbyists opportunities to slip more shit in.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The thing that amazes me is if you take a couple minutes and read that clause carefully, it's glaringly obvious what it was meant to do and not a single article or anything has ever commented on it. I picked up on it myself.</p>

        <p>I agree, it's totally destructive on so many levels.  I think one of the most insidious consequences is the way porn and pornified culture has caused a decoupling and compartmentalization of the sexual act from emotional connection.  This has devastating effects on relationships, even if you're still able to get it up.</p>

        <p>This is a the more relevant issue in my opinion (but to each their own). It's not unlike heroin addiction except that you don't get physical withdrawal symptoms (chills, sweats, diarrhea, acute sense of depression, etc) when you stop using porn.</p>

        <p>I think many of those can be addressed by riding a bicycle (well, it does wonders for me). It isn't always easy, and there are other factors that may or may not be easily dismissed. On my days off I should probably exercise instead of laying down during my "afternoon slump".</p>
<p>On days when I stayed outside messing with my solar telescope, I was able to sort of power-through the slump or hardly encountered it. Also for people on MAT (medication assisted therapy) as part of an opioid addiction recovery plan, well those medications can make people sleepy. Like Methadone and suboxone being key examples. For some, they just need to adjust their dosage and exercise more but this doesn't apply to everyone and I'll spare you from my detailed conjecture and observations on this matter.</p>
<p>Regarding those symptoms:
&rt;Lack of concentration, zero energy to put into productive tasks</p>
<p>In your opinion, how long do you think those symptoms would last? How long for them to start occurring (onset) after a person first abstains from jerking-off?</p>

        <p>The internet empowers people to say things that they'd never be willing to defend in person. It also stretches empathy well beyond its natural limits. How can anybody feel able to do anything meaningful to turn the tide when, due to global communication, they're painfully aware every moment of every day of the woes and complex problems of the entire world? That they're mere drops in an incomprehensibly deep ocean? People need to start the change in themselves and in their own households and not worry what's going on in China. </p>

<p>i was thinking exactly this a couple weeks ago. in order to be a "good person" (by whose metrics?) you have to seek to be informed on every injustice going on in the world at once. i told my parents a few months ago that i've decided to accept that i can't care about everything. i have limited bandwidth and trying to hold a nuanced opinion on every far flung political issue in the world cannot be done and is no way to live.</p>

        <p>I’ve always been curious about this too, and must ask, are you all men? I’m a woman, and am torn on it. I feel like sometimes it can help kickstart my sex drive when I’ve gone a long time without having sex. My bf feels the same way all of you do though. I have a feeling it’s completely different for woman, I’ve never personally felt addicted at all (might watch it once a month, if that, and my preferences have stayed pretty consistent). Anyone know anything about this? I feel like it must be a different story for woman based on my experience.</p>

        <p>I agree. Personally, my family is pretty open minded, but a lot of people in my community are not. If you’re more the silent activism type (I am, as well) you can put stickers from various activism groups around town (or if you’re not comfortable doing that, simply be a part of it all online, on places like Reddit and Telegram). Whatever you decide to do, your mind is in the right place and that is what matters.</p>

<p>Yes there is..  it's just that in our mad chase of technological progress,  we imagine that we can ignore and castigate the "wild" to the "outside."</p>
<p>The wild proves to us,  again and again,  it is much larger and more potent than we could ever be.  We ignore this at our own peril.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking the same thing lately, that the internet has ruined the world. Not really the internet, but social media. The ability for nobodies like me to comment on shit like videos and, well, other people's comments, seems harmless, but when multiplied by 7,000,000,000, those little nobody comments build up into an immensely powerful force of human nature that has basically developed into a worldwide natural disaster at this point.</p>

        <p>I suggest you learn a little bit about what the world was actually like 90 years ago and understand that being a "keyboard warrior" or whatever is the dumbest thing imaginable when your grandfather was probably fighting socialists with his fists in a beerhall at your age.</p>

        <p>You also have to realize that a large percentage of users on any social media could be faked. A while back I remember reading a post regarding a man being angry that his dead mom or grandmothers twitter account was being used to promote some political thing (I can’t remember exactly). When you look at a comment and think “<em>how the fuck can anyone think like this</em>” there’s really a chance it’s not a person at all. Plus many believe China/other countries employ people/bots that comment 24/7 to sway public opinion.</p>

        <p>There's also just normal people with a lot of free time who use multiple accounts to create the appearance of a social movement in their favor. Even if all you do is post your opinion 3 times under different accounts, it creates a strong impression that there's a bunch of people out there with that opinion, not just you.</p>

        <p>Definitely. IMO the peak was somewhere right around 1990. As the 90's went on, things were gravitating towards fear and restriction, and then Columbine happened and significantly accelerated the fear movement, and then 9/11 happened and sent us warp-speed into a world of panic and paranoia.</p>

        <p>I find it hilarious that your first assumption was that I expect you to die from covid. You need to relax. Seek help.</p>
<p>I was only implying that nobody cares if you delete reddit off your phone. In fact, reddit will be better off without you.</p>

        <p>What am I afraid of again? The virus I'm vaccinated for? You're the one who's afraid. Afraid of change, afraid of masks, afraid of being labelled sheep. I'm happy this pandemic is almost over so you paranoid dumbasses will finally shut up.</p>
