    <strong>What legal grounds do companies to require employees to get vaxxed</strong>
    <p><p>So on the 1st of July my state of MD is lift the state of emergency IE Mask requirements for all places, so schools, public places and transportation wont require masks to be worn. However Hogan said that Business are welcome to apply their own measures, which is a dumb idea because some businesses could  require their employees to get vaxxed or else they dont work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maryland/articles/2021-06-15/maryland-governor-ending-covid-19-state-of-emergency-july-1">https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maryland/articles/2021-06-15/maryland-governor-ending-covid-19-state-of-emergency-july-1</a> - heres a link</p>
<p>My work recently came out and said that if you got the vaccine you no longer have to wear the mask, but if you arent you should still wear one. I asked my boss what that exactly means and if they are suggesting we have to show proof if we came to be vaxxed if youre not actually vaxxed. He didnt have a good answer and he said, well we dont know at this point but it could come to that. I bought up the fact that it cant be legal for a employer IE the company im working for to require their workers to get a shot of a vaccine that of the employers choosing. Ive been looking online for the past few hours into if its legal or not and im not finding much on how a business can make their workers do something against either will and how its not illegal. Basically ive seen 3 sources saying that because its a "private" business, they are allowed to because its their rules, IE saying "well we said so!" which i cant imagine is a sound argument. Basically people are arging that companies can do it because they arent not allow to do it.  This cant be legal right guys?</p></p>

        <p>Some companies will mark you after you present proof of vaccination and let you shed the mask. The plan is to make life miserable for the unvaccinated until they relent or quit.</p>

        <p>I was just told at our employee meeting yesterday, the un-vaxxed will have to wear a mask until the end of December, and we will have to sign a disclosure that we are not vaccinated. If you are vaccinated, you have to show your vaccine card to HR, they will scan it for their file, and you will have to sign a disclosure stating you have been vaccinated. LOL, and they say my rights are not being violated.... It’s bullshit, but the same people that are promoting the loss of rights, are the same kind of sheep sitting in our courts, in or governments, in our schools, and well... they are my bosses as well.</p>

        <p>My bad, it’s not OSHA, it’s just the way HIPPA is, it is set up to walk over rights when they want too...</p>
<p>“It is not a violation of federal law for an employer to ask an employee about their vaccination status," Larry Stuart, an employment lawyer in the Houston-based law firm Stuart PC and an adjunct professor at the Jones Graduate School of Business at Rice University, tells Health. The same goes for businesses and their patrons. "[HIPAA] in no way prohibits business owners and other individuals from asking people if they have been vaccinated," Alan Meisel, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Pittsburgh, told USA Today via email. "In fact, it doesn't even prohibit health care entities mentioned above from asking people if they have been vaccinated."</p>
<p>https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/is-it-a-hipaa-violation-to-ask-about-covid-vaccine</p>
<p>The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), too, which administers and enforces laws against workplace discrimination, "has taken the position that an employer can ask that question lawfully, and require an answer to it,"</p>

        <p>I say give it a few months and all this vaccinated shit will go away anyways.  Things are pretty much back to normal around me.  People are tired of wearing the masks and now that Fauci has been called out for his involvement no one is listening to him now, not that I ever did in the first place.</p>

        <p>The covid shot is not compensated under either workmen's comp or the vaccine compensation fund.  Instead it is covered under another fund that pays substantially less and applies to emergency pandemic treatments only.  If your workplace mandates the shot, seems only fair that they would purchase insurance to provide you 100% compensation from any ill effects of mandating an emergency experimental treatment.</p>

        <p>Depends on your state. Some states give employers the right to fire a work for no reason at all, just because they want to. And these have been on the book pre-covid so they for sure will include that. The only way it could have been stopped was for the majority of your entire business to say no. But, people were not raised with spines. So that's not really an option.</p>
<p>Basically, all of this is ONLY happening as a direct result of the masses ALLOWING it.</p>

        <p>It's called " At-Will Employment ". It's in every state. A few states have certain protections limiting it. The state I live in has no protections limiting it though. I promise, they can fire anyone at anytime for any reason. If they fire someone because they are black, they will just claim it's for a different reason, you can't really prove otherwise unless you got recording of them stating such or something.</p>

        <p>true, but the leave part is more obvious. If you request off work for medical reasons for personal reasons and your work okays it, but then they fire you during that time, thats illegal termination</p>

        <p>It’s already been determined that employers can legally do this. The law doesn’t matter. EEOC already ruled on it. In Texas the nurses that sued over this just lost, the judge said it isn’t illegal! And as far as HIPAA goes, unless your employer is also your health care provider or insurance company, they aren’t a HIPAA covered entity so HIPAA doesn’t apply to them. (“Covered entities under HIPAA include health plans, healthcare providers, and healthcare clearinghouses.”)</p>

        <p>Our rights went out the window last year. Like I seriously cannot believe that even though it’s the actual law that experimental vaccines cannot be mandated, we’ve got judges and the EEOC basically saying fuck you and your rights! Also when I said “the law doesn’t matter” I meant, apparently it doesn’t matter to the judges and the EEOC who have ruled against employees and sided with employers. They ruled against the law.</p>

        <p>This is a tricky situation in the USA.</p>
<p>There is precedent that even the government can force people to get vaccinated unless they have some sort of medical issue that would make it dangerous or a religious belief:</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts</p>
<p>Recently, a Methodist hospital in Houston required employees to get vaccinated or else and a judge threw out a case against the hospital.  </p>
<p>To me, it seems like there are a couple of considerations needed for "forced" vaccinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is the employee dealing with the general public?  Is the employee dealing with an at risk population or health setting?  Is there some "business need" other than just because/virtue signaling?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organization needs to take on costs of the immunization itself, including any liability if something bad happens from the vaccine.  This includes any issues <em>after</em> employee/organization have parted ways.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the vaccine fully approved by the FDA or just for "Emergency Use?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the policy going to be for people that have reactions to vaccines or religious convictions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the risk profile of the disease itself?</p>
</li>
</ul>
