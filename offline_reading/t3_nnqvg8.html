    <strong>Grannies and children can be hurt or killed... think of the children and the grannies!!</strong>
    <p><p>Beds are UNSAFE!  About 450 people <strong>die</strong> annually by <strong>falling out of bed</strong>, usually from head and neck injuries. </p>
<p>Falling out of bed is a concern for many older adults and their loved ones. In a place where they should feel safe, and are not participating in risky activities, many seniors have experienced one or repeated episodes of falling out of bed. Depending on the bed’s height, falls may cause serious injury. And when a fall out of bed happens, they’ve just woken from sleep, so there’s a greater chance that fatigue and disorientation will keep a senior from getting the help they need.   Protect Granny! Beds HAVE to be made SAFE for everyone!</p>
<p>Even young, healthy people are at risk!!  We've got to do something to protect them! </p>

&rt;ATLANTA — Friends and family are coming together to support a Georgia Tech student injured during a freak accident at his fraternity.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;Family says Clark Jacobs, 20, fell out of his bed at his fraternity while he slept and suffered a severe head injury.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;"We thought he had the flu or meningitis because he did not look like someone who had a brain injury at first. He was completely cognizant, conversational," said his father, Ron Jacobs.   </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;His father said that at first Clark Jacobs didn't realize he'd fallen out of the bed.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;"He just climbed back into bed while sleeping," Ron Jacobs said.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;His condition quickly worsened after the Jan. 10 fall.   </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;"We treated him (at home) for less than a day and decided to take him to the hospital because with stiff neck, we were afraid it might be meningitis. They did a CT scan and we realized he had fractured skull," said Mariellen Jacobs, his mother. "He ended up having a fractured skull and a blood clot. Unfortunately it led to a bleed in his brain and (doctors) had to do emergency surgery to save his life."   </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;Right now, Clark Jacobs is still unable to talk or walk and is recovering at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta. His family is hoping for a speedy recovery.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;Before his injury, Clark Jacobs was a 3.9 GPA student at Georgia Tech with dreams of becoming a mechanical engineer.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;"It is so hard to see someone who doesn't deserve it at all," said Kelsey Jacobs, who is very close to her brother.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;His family has insurance to cover some of the extensive medical treatment, but there are services that insurance won't cover, they say. The family set up a <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/teamclark">GoFundMe page</a> to help Clark Jacobs with his expensive medical bills.   </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;"He was living the dream so we are hoping this is just a short stop and get back  to where we need him to be," his father said.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;His mother says Clark Jacobs fell on to linoleum floor. His fraternity had just installed very tall loft beds in all of the bedrooms.  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;Since Clark Jacobs' accident, they have installed guardrails on the beds.</p>
<p>But even BED RAILS aren't safe!  In 1995, the United States Food and Drug Administration reported 68 deaths, 22 injuries and 12 entrapments related to the use of side rails.  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15776716/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15776716/</a></p>
<p>Therefore, the only thing we can do is force everyone to sleep on the floor to prevent even ONE bed-related death. Flatten the curve... save Granny and the babies! Ban beds NOW!</p></p>

        <p>From what you described, that's UNSAFE! You might suffocate, or a baby might roll over face down and smother when they can't roll back over! We can't have that. Think of the baby! Even if you don't have a baby.</p>
