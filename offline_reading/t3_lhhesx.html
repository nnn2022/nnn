<title>Having had multiple conversations with school colleagues and members of the public, it seems that NONE are aware that this 'vaccine' is any different from those that came before. This is scary. How can any of them be giving informed consent without knowing its experimental novel nature?</title>

    <p><p>Not watching the radiation of MSM, I assumed at least that the mRNA/ synthetic DNA aspects of this new experimental gene-editing therapeutic was known to the public. People are assuming it's injecting live or attenuated virus into them in order to make them immune, not simply to possibly reduce symptoms. The level of ignorance is astonishing. I honestly had no idea people had no idea!</p>
<p>My question now is - if this is not a vaccine by the existing legal definition, is Pharma still relieved of liability for all of the already-concerning adverse effects? I am aware they have changed the definition of vaccine last month, but has this artificial change also been signed into law?</p></p>

        <p>If they aren't aware of the fact that the 2 most popular "vaccines" are actually experimental gene therapy, then they certainly aren't aware of all the shady shit going on behind the scenes of this pandemic.</p>
<p>These are the people that call us covid deniers and anti vaxxers.</p>

        <p>Yes. I am a teacher and had a 14 year old student call me a murderer two days ago for telling him I wasn't going to get the 'vaccine'. All the adults in the room seemed to be fine with this and got quite angry when I tried to explain how this one was not like the ones before. They won't listen. Perhaps we're destined to be dismissed at least and demonised at worst.</p>
