    <strong>I feel trapped</strong>
    <p><p>What I'm reading lately makes me think the mask situation is not going to be ending, and that the vaccine passports are going to be a thing very soon.</p>
<p>I don't want this for my family, and I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>I think moving to Florida might be a way to live freely at least for a while, but as soon as they have a new governor - who's to say that Florida won't begin forcing these things as well...</p>
<p>All I want is for my child to grow up in a normal world, and this mask thing, and lockdowns are absolutely not a part of that.</p>
<p>I feel simultaneously trapped, and that I need to leave NOW. I don't want to be forced to move somewhere to be able for them to have a normal life, but what else can I do? They are growing up with less social interaction than what they should have because of these choices that other people have made for us.</p></p>

        <p>I understand your feelings, I feel trapped too.</p>
<p>But no evil lasts forever. I just hope that all the people behind this evil shit are held accountable. Even those who were bought.</p>

        <p>I do not and cannot have children, so I cannot relate on that level.  But I presume one has a duty to ensure the maximum level of opportunity for their offspring and themselves.  This is the postulate I will be operating under for this comment.</p>
<p>I'm rather into stoicism which fights helplessness by defining what we can and cannot control.  We cannot control whether a certain place does mask nonsense or not.  We can control how we respond.  Not having children I have chosen to respond with conflict and dissent.  I've been banned from most places near me  and lost my partner because of it.  But I accepted that consequence. </p>
<p>I think the best question to ask yourself is how will you respond to your environment and take action that</p>
<p>A) allows you to succeed</p>
<p>B) allows your children to succeed</p>
<p>C) is congruent with your ethical compass</p>
<p>D) instills the values you think important to your children</p>
<p>E) leads by example</p>
<p>Maybe that's go to florida or south dakota, maybe that's buy a farm somewhere, maybe that's homeschool your kids.  Nobody knows but you.</p>
<p>There's no right or wrong answer here.  Just choices and they all have consequences.</p>

        <p>You aren’t alone in those feelings. I think a large part of the country feels the same, but we are all so separated by distance or whatever that it’s hard to see that we aren’t alone.</p>

        <p>You and me both. Same fear about a new governor in the future too. Or maybe the government finds a way to get rid of him sooner or change laws. I don't know. But I know at least in FL I will be warm and there will be plenty of beautiful places to drive to within the state. I lived there for about a decade before I moved to this nanny state years ago. </p>
<p>I'm still trapped though. I coparent here and my kid loves his friends. I'm also 3 years into a five year debt free plan and I'd really hate to ruin that. I'm so comfortable financially for the first time since the divorce, even though I'm trapped. </p>
<p>Good luck in your decision. I know how hard it is.</p>

        <p>This shit is nuts, I feel like a typical American immigrant (1800s)  - I have to leave the place that I am in search of a better life for my family. That is what has become of the place I grew up.</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. 
I don't have kids yet, we were supposed to start a family soon and then everything started so I don't know when it'll happen, which also scares me. I wish we could have our old life back.
I'm scared for myself, my partner and my parents.</p>
