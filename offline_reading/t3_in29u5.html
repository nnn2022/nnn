        <p>Dr. Didier Raoult of France was using something as simple and cheap as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with zinc and an antibiotic to successfully treat coronavirus patients. The news of Raoult’s success spread like wildfire, and U.S. President Donald Trump ultimately promoted the treatment, which acts as both a prophylactic and a therapeutic.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t matter how many doctors successfully treat coronavirus patients using HCQ and zinc. It doesn’t matter what people do in the home to help their immune system through the infection. What matters is drug company profits.
What is Gilead's role in the war on hydroxychloroquine   ----
https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2020/08/what_is_gileads_role_in_the_war_on_hydroxychloroquine.html</p>
<p>The war on Hydroxychloroquine can be traced back to Gilead, the drug maker looking to profit big from Remdesivir</p>
<p>Remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial </p>
<p>adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. </p>

        <p>HCQ, zithromax and zinc total up to less than a Chipotle bowl. But ventilators and remdesivir make money machine go brrrr. There's your answer. Stay tuned for the deal between whichever pharmaceutical company wins the vaccine race and world governments. And let's keep not pushing the importance of a healthy diet and regular exercise to improve overall health.</p>

        <p>Yup. Feeling generally "off?" You can't focus, here's some Adderall. And to counteract the shitty effects of that, here's some Xanax. And counteract the shitty effects of that combination, here's an antidepressant. There, all fixed.</p>

        <p>To my knowledge, Hydroxychloroquine had anecdotal of evidence of working that was never replicated since.</p>
<p>FDA tried it out and now says it isn’t worth the terrible side effects at the dose needed.</p>
<p>If Hydroxychloroquine really worked, we would have known by now.</p>

        <p>It does work and we know how for coronaviruses. It’s by messing with the replication mechanisms of the virus in cells. </p>
<p>The drug had also been widely used for decades for a whole ranges of conditions including as a prophylactic for malaria. </p>
<p>Try to educated yourself :)</p>

<p>And if you think it is not about the profit of Big Pharma read the following story!!!</p>
<p>Professor Raoult testified that, shortly after he started to talk about HCQ as a treatment, in March, he received anonymous death threats. He filed a complaint with the police, and an enquiry was opened by the French judiciary. The medical doctor behind the threats was found and happens to be from a Nantes university hospital. It happened to be the person who received the most money from Gilead over the past 6 years. Professor Raoult presents this as a “personal experience.” In his testimony, he remained diplomatic and suggested “to be attentive to this level of problem.”
International politics and greed are preventing millions of people from receiving the life-saving treatment of HCQ to battle the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Hopefully, some day the criminal minds behind the assault on HCQ will be brought to justice.</p>
