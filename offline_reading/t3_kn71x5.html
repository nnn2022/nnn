    <strong>I'm confusing myself. Am I becoming one of them?</strong>
    <p><p>When I see an 80 year old person out shopping or walking around without a mask I have an inescapable feeling of rage come over me. Like goddammit granny isn't the reason that I can't go to a restaurant so that you can stay alive for another 6 months? Can't we just take all the old people and the fats and put them on an island somewhere so the rest of us can just live?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah most of them didn’t ask for this any more then we did. In fact, many old people I know are just as sad, angry, and frustrated as we are - they know they are getting old and being forced to spend their golden years isolated away from their families. A lot of our older family members have been going to casinos and whatnot, since their kids and grandparents are staying away from them for their “protection”. </p>
<p>I think its all so sad. People need to make their own choices.</p>

        <p>I know it's irrational. I think it just shows how good they are at programming us. I know my feelings are bullshit but I still can't help it. My Mom is in her 70's and she refuses to not see her grandchildren even though others in my family tell her not too because it's dangerous.</p>

        <p>My 76 year old mother is even more anti-mask than I am (and equally against this new normal BS)—she spent two weeks with me, my husband and her three grandkids over Christmas right after we all got off an international flight. So no, seniors do not have any less right to freedom than we younger people do. If they want to “chance it” then that should be their right as well as ours. The real problem is the totalitarian mask/lockdown crap imposed on all of us by government.</p>

        <p>I struggled with this at the very beginning of all of this. My grandma was still going to concerts going out all the time. The neighborhood we live in is majority elderly and they were all out talking and not social distancing coming up to my kids and I giving us chalk giving us stuff to do because they felt bad that our kids were locked at home. And I felt afraid of them oddly enough. It was the first step and me realizing the TV is bullshit And lying to me that all of these old people are scared because not a single elderly person I knew was afraid</p>

        <p>In fact, a significant section of the scientific community has advocated for this from day one. Since the virus overwhelmingly affects the old and obese, then let’s help <em>these</em> people properly isolate (provided they want to), and let everyone else can carry on as normal.</p>
<p>Forcing <em>everyone</em> in to a shambolic semi-isolation is neither fair nor effective.</p>

        <p>I think there are two sides to that scenario when it comes to older folks, some that isolate themselves and take every precaution under the sun and some that don't because "they don't have much longer to live anyways" and just enjoy the time they have left... what you have found is the second!</p>
