    <strong>Mysophobe’s perspective on doomers and masking</strong>
    <p><p>I have mysophobia. For those who don’t know, it’s pretty much interchangeable with germophobia. I’m making this post because a lot of my tendencies fall close in line with those of many doomer’s, and I thought some people might like to hear the opinions of a mysophobic antimasker. </p>
<p>I would classify my mysophobia as mild to moderate. In public, I can function fairly normally, as most of my obsessive mysophobic tendencies happen in my own home. </p>
<p>Essentially, like many doomers, I believe the outside is “contaminated.” I hate touching things that aren’t mine, and I hate letting other people touch my things. Anything that I take outside with me, including myself, is considered to be contaminated, too, and I feel compelled to “decontaminate” everything once I’ve gotten home. I’m very conscious of this “contamination.” For example, if I touch something I feel is contaminated, then my hands become contaminated, too, along with everything I touch thereafter. It seems that many doomers are also very conscious of this perceived “contamination.” </p>
<p>After some thinking, I believe there are two primary differences between myself and doomers. </p>
<p>First, I understand that my beliefs are irrational. Understanding they’re irrational doesn’t make my obsessive tendencies go away, but it allows me to view my issues objectively so that I can work on improving them. </p>
<p>And second, even though my beliefs are irrational, I firmly believe they are at least based upon a general understanding of how contaminants spread. Short of going around in a HAZMAT suit, there is no way to escape them. As far as I know, the best way to avoid coming into contact with pathogens is to try very hard not to touch anything.</p>
<p>The second point, to me, is the most significant. Masks don’t make humans any less filthy. They don’t make contaminants disappear. My understanding is that a majority of sicknesses are contracted by touching contaminated objects. And beyond that, anyone can see for themselves in cold weather that “contaminated” human breath easily escapes from a mask. </p>
<p>All these measures to “protect against covid” have done literally nothing to assuage my fears of “contaminants.” As someone who is very conscious of this stuff, I recognize that they do just about nothing. On the contrary, people seem to be touching their faces a lot more to mess with their masks, which, even to someone who doesn’t suffer from mysophobia, obviously facilitates the spread of pathogens... </p>
<p>And that’s why, even being as paranoid as I am, I’m an antimasker. Even if I rationalized in my head that masks protect me from “contaminants,” I would still know that that rationalization comes from a part of me that is sick, and I know not to impose things like that on anyone else. </p>
<p>I don’t doubt that a lot of doomers are genuinely afraid of covid, but I think their fear is not only irrational, but also based on irrationality. My irrational tendencies are based on the general understanding that all you can really do to avoid getting sick is to wash your hands and try not to touch anything, and to avoid people who are actively sick... you know, how it’s always been. But the doomer’s metric to avoid getting sick is to... what? Blindly listen to the figureheads? Wear their mask talismans? </p>
<p>I guess the reason I wrote this is because I notice a lot of people on this sub comparing doomers to mysophobes, which is somewhat true, but I think some are missing the nuance. Doomers and mysophobes both are sick, but it’s not the same sickness. Usually “doomer mysophobia” is not broadly applied and only really relates to masking and similar. They also exhibit the irrational fear of contamination but don’t really take any personal initiative to do anything about it. They just trust in the word of Fauci. Also, it’s one thing to be like me and not want to touch the keypad at the grocery store because of an irrational repulsion. It’s another thing entirely to not want to touch it because you’re convinced you might actually die if you do. </p>
<p>What exactly their issue is, I’m not sure, but it’s definitely related to some sort of compliance complex, in my opinion.</p></p>
