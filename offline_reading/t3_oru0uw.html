    <strong>What to do if you caught covid?</strong>
    <p><p>Just want to preface, I’m completely against getting the vaccine. I don’t trust it, and don’t plan on getting it. This isn’t a post to make people change their stance.</p>
<p>In my group of friends, everyone but me and another are vaccinated. Everyone always gives us shit for it and tries pushing it down our throats but we always resist. Well I found out my unvaccinated friend caught covid. So I messaged him privately, away from our group chat. I asked him how he feels. Is it like a common cold as people say, and does he wish he got the vaccine.</p>
<p>He told me he ended up going to the ER. That it is far from a cold. He says he’s okay for now, but occasionally feels like ripping out his chest, and that he has a headache and fever. He said his girlfriend has the vaccine too, and caught covid but didn’t catch any symptoms. He surprised me because he said “get the vaccine, trust me, you don’t want none of this”. He’s the conservative in our group, I’m more of a centrist, but lean conservative, while everyone else is liberal. I’m surprised that he, who was super against the vaccine alongside with me, is now saying to get it.</p>
<p>Additional info, we’re in California and are both 25. I have no pre-existing conditions, but he does, he has asthma, which I guess might be a factor. Anyways, it’s just eye opening to me to see someone so against it now telling me to get it. I feel conflicted about it now, I still don’t trust it, but him saying that makes me reconsider my stance. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Also, anybody here catch covid and what was it like?</p></p>

        <p>I'm guessing his asthma is what made it harder for him. He's not thinking straight right now. Go look at r/CovidVaccinated for like 5 minutes. It will get your head back on track. Hope your friend recovers fine like most 25 year olds do!</p>

        <p>When I had covid in January the muscle aches are what did me in the most, and sometimes I felt like I was under water from the brain fog, and I couldn’t taste/smell (great for alcoholism btw) but other than that it was your general cold symptoms, runny nose, sore throat etc. definitely didnt feel like it was bad at all. As someone else said, it was way blown out of proportions.</p>

        <p>Had it in February, took sick leave for ~5 days, because eyes were not able to look at the screen. about 5 days more felt just like common cold. Since the beginning of 2020 I'm meditating every day using Chinese qi-qong system (funny enough) and those days I was doing it 2 times more with focus on lungs. Think it helped me to practically have no issues and no post-effects. Now I've bought ivermectin and almost want to get it in order to test this cure on myself.</p>

        <p>So, it is not like the cold and I think people who say that are ridiculous. It can be serious and there are lassie effects sometimes but I'd still rather catch this man made virus than get this vaccine. Also, just because he is having a hard time doesn't mean you will. Take vitamins, hydrate yourself, get your exercise in.</p>

        <p>I mean, do you think it is? I guess people make their own decisions on whether they think it's similar to a common cold. Perhaps the delta variant is, idk, I may have a different stance. I think COVID is real, I think some people should get the vaccine but fuck lockdowns, fuck mandated masks and vaccines. At the end of the day, regardless of what your friends or the internet says you should make the best decision for you. Even if you are vaccinated, as I'm sure we all know you can still catch COVID, you can also still die from it among God knows what else.</p>

        <p>the main factor is your own immunity. not the virus, not the variant.. this is why it manifests so differently in everyone. not the virus takes you to the ICU, your own immune system carpet bombing does. get your immunity in check - take enough vit D and zinc for start. if you find you got it, urge your MD to early treatment - ivermectin or hydroxychlorquine - just a 3-5day course, even if your symptoms are mild, can wastly change the later outcome of the illness</p>

        <p>The CDC claims that there is no way to distingush the cold from covid other than using a Test.</p>
<p>Couple that with the massive attack on human psyche during the last 1.5 years and youd get tons of people freaking out about this cold being much worse than previous ones, based on their impaired perception.</p>

        <p>He's asthmatic.  If he'd have had the vaccine, it seems probable that he would have experienced similarly unpleasant symptoms.  The difference is, the effects of Covid-19 should eventually go away in time.  You can't unvaccinated yourself. </p>
<p>I've known a handful of people that caught covid - the vast majority of them described it as being similar to a mild case of the flu.  The one who described it as being worse was also asthmatic, and although she did not require hospitalization, she is still experiencing problems a few months on.  It might be worth mentioning that she was fully vaccinated when she caught it.  So anecdotally, the virus only seems to be a real problem if you have comorbid issues, and vaccination didn't stop my friend from catching it.  Keep yourself healthy - take a daily multivitamin with Vit A, C and D, and start taking zinc.  Nobody knows what the future holds, but at this stage, I'd rather trust my immune system than place my trust in an experimental vaccine program.</p>

        <p>It was actually pretty brutal for me. Missed a week of work, horrible fever, and took two weeks for me to walk more than 30ft without wheezing.</p>
<p>I'm also in terrible shape, skinny, but don't exercise, and I vape compulsively, lol.</p>
<p>I took DayQuil, Gatorade, and bed rest (I watched all of GreenArrow on Hulu, it was meh).</p>
<p>It sucked, but all my coworkers had it and 3yrs ago no one would have batted an eye at a contagious flu spreading around.</p>

        <p>Vaped the entire time. I don't think it made it better, but definitely didn't make it worse.</p>
<p>I felt like having the extra moisture in my lungs helped to clear them out with big coughs. I could be totally wrong and doing long term damage to my lungs, but that's just my personal experience.</p>

        <p>It’s funny all my friends who have had covid that smoke cigarettes and weed basically said the worst of it lasted at most 3 days and they were fine within 7
I do worry a bit about vaping (juul) but idk I feel like we haven’t heard many covid cases going horribly south that have been connected to smoking of any kind it’s more like asthma and obesity and diabetes</p>

        <p>I just slept for about 3 weeks, only dragged myself out of bed to piss and take Epsom salt baths. My wife kept me hydrated during it. It definitely sucked but I got through it.</p>
<p>At the time we didn't know what it was, since it was very early and the only listed symptoms where just cold symptoms, and I was feverish, full body aches and spewing from both ends with enough force to make me never want to eat anything but very salty soup broth. Also coughing, but I didn't think much of it because I was coughing hard enough to make myself puke.</p>

        <p>I caught it and it was barely more than nothing. Several other people in my family did too, ranging from almost asymptomatic to a week of flu-like symptoms and another week or two of taste/smell distortion. Nobody needed medical care (other than taking OTC cold medicine and a nap). No real pattern regarding age and health, either, though officially all were mild because they were all treatable at home.</p>
