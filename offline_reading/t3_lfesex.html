    <strong>Normalize calling covidiots and alarmists conspiracy theorists.</strong>
    <p><p>We are not the ‘conspiracy theorists’ in this situation. even if you buy into the inflated cdc data we are right, states with no lockdowns and no masks are doing better and have people living their normal lives, earning an income. we use the scientific method the and empirical data(even when its inflated).</p></p>

        <p>I've been calling them "suicide advocates," since their support of these measures have driven suicide rates up to staggering amounts, especially in adolescents. As a matter of fact I'm holding all of them personally responsible for every kid that kills themselves because of this. It's amazing how much they dislike it when you call them this.</p>

        <p>Neither of these states evidence of suicides increasing by "staggering amounts."</p>
<p>The Peru study in fact indicates a drop in suicides during the lockdown period.</p>
<p>The Brookings paper mentions that suicide calls are only up "slightly," and the only population it states that definitively have increases in suicides are rural residents of India. It does state subjective analyses of emotional wellbeing are down substantially, but that's not the same as suicide rates themselves spiking.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/suicides-alberta-bc-saskatchewan-canada-2020-no-increase-1.5902908">other studies have shown suicide rates are flat.</a></p>

        <p>A quick Google search shows that while Japan’s suicide rate has increased, the number by which it has is <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/01/22/national/japan-suicide-rate/">just 3.7%</a>. That’s absolutely an increase, but it’s not one I’d call “staggering.”</p>
<p>From the perspective of a public health policy administrator, common sense is not enough to trigger modifications to policy. Any serious one needs data in hand to justify any such changes.</p>

        <p>Google, brilliant little check up. Try using something that doesn't censor the shit out of everything maybe. The lives of young people and the current workforce are more valuable than the elderly, blunt but honest. Why kill a nation for something that only kills the nations weakest. It's natural selection, we should do what we can to protect them, but we need to protect the economy, small businesses, education, mental health, freedom etc as well. Come back when you're willing to acknowledge the real problems here, because the Covid deaths are anything but staggering. That's why the government refuses to tell you them</p>

        <p>Feel free to provide a data source re: suicides that you think Google is censoring.</p>
<p>You’re wanting to have a different discussion than the one we were having. I was asking specifically for data on the assertion suicide deaths have spiked a staggering amount, because I’d heard suicide data was being reported on a delay and was curious if any had been published that I’d missed. </p>
<p>Are you conceding that there doesn’t appear to be compelling evidence suicide rates have increased dramatically?</p>

        <p>For a start your simple Google search brings up exactly what I said, with suicide increases in Japan being reported as 19% from an already too high number. So either your searches are seriously censored, only showing you the things your able to handle based off search history or your lying. The suicide rates in the UK haven't been released, but everyone knows they're guaranteed to be higher the previous years however how much higher is obviously unknown until the stats are released. 
I'd say the 19% in Japan is dramatic, especially considering the fact their suicides have been declining for years. Since the UKs restrictions have been harsher than anywhere in Japan, mental health here will be considerably more seriously affected, and you're telling me that you're unable to predict that they're going to be way worse than usual? Really?
Tell me, how many people have died of Covid in the UK?</p>

        <p>The 3.7% increase comes from data released by the Japanese ministry of health. What’s the source for 19%?</p>
<p>So you do concede that there isn’t hard data to support the assertion suicide rates have increased dramatically, other than in Japan, making the statement that suicides have increased dramatically a purely speculative statement. I’ll note that early data shows <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/suicides-alberta-bc-saskatchewan-canada-2020-no-increase-1.5902908">no sign of a suicide spike in Canada</a>, so it’s not as though I’m deflecting in bad faith. Far as I can tell, there truly doesn’t seem to be data to indicate an increase in suicide deaths, or at least not a dramatic increase.</p>

        <p>No, I'm saying that there's no evidence a spike will be indicated after data is released. Japan's data shows a small increase. Canada's preliminary data shows no increase. Some smaller studies in the US also don't show an increase.</p>
<p>It's possible that the UK will eventually have one, but at this point it's pure speculation as to whether there will be such an increase or not.</p>
<p>Have that 19% source handy yet? I'd like to see the source you're putting more stock in than the Japanese ministry of health.</p>

        <p>I never said that that stat was reliable, I said it was the first that came up on Google, therefore meaning if you missed it you're either blind, stupid, or your searches are being censored. When in the UK 73% of students admit to a serious decline in mental health, do you really think that suicides won't significantly increase, can you honestly say that.

        <p>So you don't want to cite your source and have a conversation about data, you just want to assert that I'm stupid because my search engine isn't able to find the random site not affiliated with Japan's ministry of health that's stating a suicide rate increase substantially different from actual government data.</p>
<p>&rt;When in the UK 73% of students admit to a serious decline in mental health, do you really think that suicides won't significantly increase, can you honestly say that</p>
<p>As I stated above, a Brookings paper cited by someone else here indicated that despite subjective analyses of emotional wellbeing dropping substantially, calls to health providers for suicides have barely increased. It's certainly possible that over time, suicides will begin to elevate, but at this point there is no data to indicate that the suicide rate has already increased a "staggering" amount.</p>

        <p>I personally would never call a mental health service, most men wouldn't and may women wouldn't. That isn't a true representation of anything. And I think you'll find that the number of Covid deaths doesn't exist, they'll tell you how many people died within 28 days of a positive, but not how many people have actually died of Covid. When the government are hiding and manipulating the numbers like that I wouldn't trust many stats that come from them in all fairness. They're known liars who only care about power and pocket and to side with what they're doing is to side with the downfall of humanity in any nation with "leaders" who run is such a fashion. Fuck the lockdown. Fuck the pointless masks. Fuck the "science" that the government control. Fuck the vaccines I don't need because I'm healthy. 
The only thing the people need is freedom</p>

<p>lol you think public health administrators went in to government because of their lust for money and control? How much control do you think they had before 2020? Ever investigated how much money private industry will pay a respected medical researcher?</p>

<p>Chris Whitty is on around <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9061223/Top-scientific-advisers-rake-400k.html">£210,000</a>.

        <p>I'll be slightly facetious, but do sources and stats even matter anymore?</p>
<p>The narrative on the other end that's used against anti-maskers/skeptics doesn't have any sources either, it's just, "People are dying because of you, you piece of trash!" And besides, isn't "one death is too many" their favorite thing to say? Well in that case, there is the mother who is suing her state (forget which one) because her teenage son killed himself because of the lockdown. That's the single death I need to justify my sentiment by this logic. </p>
<p>I like how people ask for statistics and try to be skeptical in some situations, but then if you go to another sub and see a post about covid deaths, the highest comments will be some flavor of "Fuck you anti masking Trump supporters!"</p>
<p>To you ask about sources - I don't have any on hand. I have a few journalists on Twitter whose content I read through every once in a while, and they have posted about increased suicide rates over the last few months. I will see if I can find some of those later today and come back to you though. </p>
<p>Have a great day!</p>

        <p>Statistics must matter when speaking about public policy. 400,000 deaths is a startling number and is informing much of existing policy. To counter it, you need to have evidence that that policy is actually causing harm. Without it, you’re saying policy should be made on what <em>feels</em> accurate to you, which is frankly a terrible method of crafting policy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, evidence matters to the extent you’re building a narrative about the virus. You’re the one saying suicides have increased a “staggering” amount. That’s an evocative description that intuitively would need to have a remarkably strong level of evidence supporting it. If you’re conceding there is no such evidence, then that says quite a bit about the level of trust a neutral observer should give your assertions.</p>
<p>If you’re referring to Alex Berenson as one of your journalists... lol.</p>

        <p>Not an assumption, and not a fallacy. I know he's a prominent journalist on Twitter that's been fervently stating suicides are increasing, so it's fair to ask if he's one of the journalists you're referring to. I also know that he's had some... odd takes recently, which is why it's a lol if his opinion is one that's informing yours.</p>

        <p>Yes, unsupported as in you said it and didn't provide any sort of evidence to support the comparison. It's surprising you're not familiar with the word, since everything you corona cultists ever say meets the definition.</p>

        <p>It's funny how you're all so certain that evidence will have no impact on my beliefs, since none of you have ever showed me any to know if that would be the case. Thing is, I'm opposed to lockdowns, mask mandates etc because there is precisely zero evidence that they achieve anything, and a shit-ton of evidence for the vast amount of harm and suffering they cause. If you provided evidence that they do in fact save lives (more than they end, at least), I would change my mind. But of course you can't do that, because your position is completely unsupported by any evidence, so you just imply that you have a heap of supporting evidence, but there's no point showing it to me, and I hope I won't notice that you don't have any.</p>
