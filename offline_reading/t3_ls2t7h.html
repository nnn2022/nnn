    <strong>Swiss to vote in referendum on government's COVID-19 measures</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;Swiss campaigners have triggered a referendum on ending the government's COVID-19 restrictions.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The association Freunden der Verfassung (Friends of the Constitution) has filed a petition to the Federal Chancellery with 90,000 signatures.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Swiss law means any petition that is backed by more than 50,000 people will go to a national referendum.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong><em>The association has argued the government's legislation, passed by parliament in September 2020, is "dangerous, unethical, and unnecessary".</em></strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Last month, Swiss authorities announced plans to shut restaurants, bars, sports facilities, and cultural institutions until the end of February.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong><em>But Friends of the Constitution say the move is "disproportionate" and "demonstrably ineffective".</em></strong> The association's spokesperson, Christoph Pfluger, is a known critic of the country's COVID-19 measures.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Opponents also say the bill focuses too much on financial measures that the government can already regulate by federal decrees, without the need for emergency powers.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong><em>Others believe the law gives the government too much power to enforce a "compulsory system with poorly tested vaccines"</em></strong>, something that the Federal Council has repeatedly denied.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"People and companies who have been pushed to the brink by the irresponsible dictates of the Federal Council must be helped," the group said in a <a href="https://verfassungsfreunde.ch/de">statement</a>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Any referendum vote on the government's measures will take place after June 2021, when the law will have been in force for nine months.</p>
