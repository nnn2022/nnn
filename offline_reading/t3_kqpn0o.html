        <p>We had a freedom problem long before covid. It has been a way for them to break through to the next step. Even if covid goes away (which it won't), we have to be deligent and aware of the next thing used to take freedom.</p>

        <p>Describing how a virus spreads is not proof of contagion. Your silly webmd article makes the assumption that a virus is contagious eland then explains <em>how</em> it transmits. This is not proof a virus is contagious. Thanks anyway.</p>

        <p>I had never met anyone arguing against this. The article explains how a virus spreads from person to person, which is exactly what you asked. Transmission and contagion is equivalent.</p>
<p>Are you seriously arguing that viruses are not contagious? Do you have any proof to believe so or did you just think it would be a cool thing to argue?</p>

        <p>Again, the article you linked describes how a contagious virus is transmitted from person to person. It <em>assumes,</em> foundationally, and then proceeds to explain how it spreads. There is an initial step I am looking for here.</p>
<p>I am asking if you have proof a virus is contagious. Your side is making the claim. I have no need to disprove something which has not been proven.</p>

        <p>I mean you could just look through the Wikipedia article to see how viruses work and spread, and how they make people sick. Spreading is the basis of a virus since it cannot reproduce by itself, so it needs to find cells to infect to reproduce. </p>
<p>It's all right here:

        <p>I have looked through the Wikipedia article. I have examined mainstream academia regarding germ theory. Assuming i havent is intellectually dishonest. Do you often base your opinions on assumptions?</p>
<p>A virus can only be produced from decaying cellular material. It is dead, and is produced from death. </p>
<p>“Spreading” a virus is an assumption. Germ theory. This is not the truth. I would implore you to provide empirical evidence a virus is contagious. A Wikipedia explanation is insufficient as proof.</p>

        <p>They might not be contagious, but there's things the government could do that would reduce those deaths tremendously like ban fast food, alcohol, or sugar. However, we've learned as a society that prohibition failed and that we accept certain risks for the benefit of living a free lifestyle which includes the choice to take on risk. If we had a speed limit of 25 everywhere we would eliminate most automobile deaths too but we decided that the convenience of going 60 mph is worth the amount of deaths that causes.</p>

        <p>I really fail to understand this illogical talking point. If a person with COVID-19 dies when they wouldn’t have died if they didn’t have COVID-19, how could you possibly argue that the death isn’t attributable to COVID-19?</p>
<p>Edit: if you die of respiratory failure as a direct result of COVID-19, you won’t be in that 6% because 2 causes of death will be listed, proving how absurd this talking point is.</p>

        <p>What? That article says the exact opposite. </p>
<p>It says that covid causes the deaths of people with covid. 5-6% of people died just of covid and 95% of people died from covid caused ailments. If you get covid and are sick and in the hospital and die from a stroke. Covid pushed your body to the point you had a stroke. </p>
<p>If I break my leg and start bleeding out and then go into shock and then have a heart attack, breaking my leg caused my heart attack. </p>
<p>The OPs point is that 100,000s of people die ever year from other causes of death. But now because of covid we’ve got to wear masks and have shutdowns etc and only 300,000 people died.</p>
<p>The problem, that any educated intelligent person understands, is that VIRUSES get transmitted from person to person. If you get coughed on by a covid person, you get sick to and can die. </p>
<p>If a fat person with coronary heart issues coughs on you, you don’t catch their fatness. They just die from a heart attack later and you go about your day. </p>
<p>Viruses have to be Stopped from spreading, the less people exposed, the less sick people. Masks and social distancing so far have done a good job slowing the spread.</p>

        <p>They always have. Flu does the same thing yet we haven’t wrecked everything in past. If it weren’t Covid, something else would have pushed those people. We accepted some risk before. Same with car accidents - when driving, you are a threat to other people and plenty of innocent bystanders die. Those are risks of life. Do what we have always done. Protect the vulnerable and pour resources into that. Others should live their lives because risks to not doing so are becoming more apparent daily.</p>

        <p>I understood everything you said, except you entirely missed the important point about a disease. Diseases spread, car accidents don't spread, heart disease doesn't spread.</p>
<p>The flu does spread it is a disease, but we have a vaccine for that and we give that vaccine to high risk people and anyone else who gets it, so it doesn't spread. </p>
<p>It would take 1 NBA basketball game to infect thousands of people with a disease like covid (or the flu) and then those infected people would infect their families back at home and their coworkers at work and everyone on their commute, if they took a bus of subway for example. This doesn't happen with the flu because lots of people get flu shots and then don't get the flu, so it can't spread. </p>
<p>That isn't an "acceptable risk" because if one person gets the flu, we have flu shots and it doesn't spread, if two people get in a car accident on the highway, sure there is a traffic jam, but every next car doesn't also crash into the crash and more people keep dying, just the original people in the crash. </p>
<p>The MASSIVE part that people are NOT getting is how healthcare works, or how hospitals work. There are only so many hospitals, doctors, and nurses, and ventilators, etc. </p>
<p>When you get covid and it gets bad your lungs start failing and you literally can't breath. You can't just rest at home and take some niquil and feel better, you NEED to go to a hospital and get on a ventilator to get your body enough oxygen to survive until you fight off the virus, otherwise you die. </p>
<p>The problem, since covid spreads, that means millions of people will become sick. Like I said one basketball could get thousands sick. Hospitals would fill up. Once a hospital is full. Where do you think people go? NO WHERE, they just die. Then what happens if you get in a car crash and the ambulance takes you to the hospital, but the hospital is FULL with people sick from covid and you need surgery and a hospital bed to recuperate, sorry hospital is full, then YOU die and you didn't even have covid. </p>
<p>Risks with a disease without a vaccination are off the charts if you don't manage the spread of the disease. Complete shutdowns for months at a time aren't good, but wearing masks and social distancing is. </p>
<p>I really feel that high schools need to teach statistics classes instead of it being a college course. Because people really don't understand statistics, but sure do like using them to back up their points.</p>

        <p>I see your concerns, but they are not quite equivalent. Why are flu deaths acceptable? People die from flu and health practitioners have for long been say8ng that the flu deaths are actually underestimated. As for the hospitals being overwhelmed, please do this exercise. Go to google. Enter flu hospitals overwhelmed or some permutation. Set your search to before November 30 2019. Hospitals get overwhelmed constantly. Covid is a respiratory virus, so we can compare it to other respiratory viruses. Is it worse than flu? It seems to be for the elderly and vulnerable. Is it so much worse that we should destroy the lives of the new generation? I don’t accept that risk.</p>

        <p>&rt; I see your concerns, but they are not quite equivalent. Why are flu deaths acceptable? </p>
<p>Did you not read what I just wrote? They aren't acceptable, but we have flu vaccines, so they are actively preventable if people get their flu shot, just like wearing a seat belt in a car. Covid isn't preventable prior to getting vaccinated, so people have to physically prevent it spread. If I catch covid and go to my christmas dinner and invite all 4 of my grandparents and my older aunts and uncles and cough on all them, they will all highly potentially catch covid and then highly potentially die. If I catch the flu and go to dinner and cough on them and they all had their flu shots, then nothing happens. </p>
<p>&rt; People die from flu and health practitioners have for long been say8ng that the flu deaths are actually underestimated. </p>
<p>That's probably true, but I highly doubt they are underestimate by 100,000's. But again, we have a flu vaccine. Every year there are literally commercials that tell people to get their flu shot. If you die from the flu and you didn't get a flu shot, that is the equivalent of you dying in a car crash because you didn't wear your seat belt. </p>
<p>Covid doesn't have a vaccine available at every corner drug store yet (its happening, but not yet wide spread). So you can't get vaccinated even if you wanted to (yet) and certainly not earlier last year because there wasn't one. </p>
<p>&rt; As for the hospitals being overwhelmed, please do this exercise. Go to google. Enter flu hospitals overwhelmed or some permutation. Set your search to before November 30 2019. Hospitals get overwhelmed constantly. </p>
<p>I am 100% going to believe you and not even look that up, because its well known that "flu season" is around late fall/winter time. I have no doubt hospitals are possibly overwhelmed around that time. But I will say that I have NEVER seen in my adult life commentary from my actual friends around the country who work in actual hospitals telling me they are putting people in beds in hallways because they don't have room. There's "overwhelmed" and we need a bigger budget next year and maybe a bigger new wing because they cities population grew in the last 5 years, and "overwhelmed" as in all 5 major hospitals in a region are full and if you need to go to a hospital, you're getting rationed healthcare or can go to another hospital 3 cities over. </p>
<p>&rt; Covid is a respiratory virus, so we can compare it to other respiratory viruses. Is it worse than flu? </p>
<p>It's worse than the flu because it has a higher rate of death than the flu. But its WAY worse because we don't have a vaccine. It's very wierd to explain to people the problems of viruses when they don't seem to have any recollection of the time before vaccines. If you caught small pox, you just died. If you got polio, you either died or you got fucked up for the rest of your life. This was just accepted as part of life. Random people in your family would just die from a disease and you'd move on like if they got hit by a car, shit happens. </p>
<p>Then they invented vaccines and magically overnight, the idea of dying from a disease even as a healthy child or adult is just poof gone, unthinkable. </p>
<p>So, its not that covid is ebola or hiv, its just simply didn't have a vaccine for all of 2020. There was no way to protect yourself from it other than either be asymptomatic or never go outside. The lack of vaccination simply means it will spread fast until everyone is either sick, dies, or gets over it, but spread it the whole time they were sick with possibly minimal symptoms. REALLY overwhelming hospitals. Rural areas/towns/cities in North Dakota don't have 5 huge hospitals. They have like one small one. It doesn't take much to overwhelm a hospital like that. </p>
<p>&rt; It seems to be for <em>the elderly and vulnerable</em>. Is it so much worse that we should destroy the lives of the new generation? I don’t accept that risk.</p>
<p>We know that now, specifically, we know that NOW, we didn't know in February that it was specifically going to affect elderly and vulnerable it might have been worse, because it has killed perfectly healthy doctors, nurses, college kids and adults, just not many. </p>
<p>I will 100% agree that "shutdowns" for months on end, are bad and not "worth the risk". That is bad governance. </p>
<p>In march the entire united states should have had one single shutdown for 3 weeks and had everyone get paid to stay home, every business every person paid buy the federal government to stay home. </p>
<p>Then after that everything opens back up, except everyone where masks and socially distances and places have capacity limits, until people are vaccinated. That would have been an appropriate reaction to the "risk".</p>

        <p>I appreciate response and currently have no time to address it further. Not everybody gets the flu shot. Covid is worse than flu, but by how much? Worth the risk of keeping healthy at home? We know that for those without major comorbidities are really not at high risk of dying https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32846654/  and flu effs up your lungs and heart, too (if we are worried about long Covid). We are also learning that asymptomatic transmission is rare (link cited before). Why don’t you continue participating in this thread and keep an eye out for studies that we post. We can then argue point by point.</p>

        <p>&rt; I appreciate response and currently have no time to address it further. Not everybody gets the flu shot. </p>
<p>The point I'm making, the take away, the logic...is that its an option that a person can choose themselves to protect themselves from the flu. Like choosing to put on a seat belt or not. You may get in a car crash, but you personally can choose to get the flu shot or wear a seat belt to save your own life. </p>
<p>There is no single thing that can protect you from covid other than wearing a full hazmat suit everytime you leave your house. A thin paper mask isn't for your protection, it's for everyone else's protection and not even 100% protection, just a good attempt to slow down the spread of the virus. (Until now when we have vaccines, which people are starting to get.) </p>
<p>Covid is worse than flu, but by how much? Worth the risk of keeping healthy at home? It is worse, and it was much worse when it first started in America in early 2020, the shutdowns then were appropriate, but without an actual 100% country wide shutdown, do not go outside, do no go to work etc., for 3 solid weeks. The general idea of a shutdown is pointless if a good size percentage of people are still wandering around outside. </p>
<p>It is not that deadly that we should still be having shutdowns, just huge fines for people people not wearing masks and ignoring social distancing and keep things like sporting events, concerts, and bars, shutdown as they are huge spreader events. But pay those companies money for agreeing to shut down from the government, noone requested to shut down should be going out of business. </p>
<p>&rt; We know that for those without major comorbidities are really not at high risk of dying https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32846654/ and flu effs up your lungs and heart, too (if we are worried about long Covid). We are also learning that asymptomatic transmission is rare (link cited before). </p>
<p>I don't disagree with any of that to an extent and it doesn't affect my point that one shutdown early on was appropriate, any continuing shutdowns are not. 100% of enforcement of masks and social distancing needs to be enforced to prevent spread. </p>
<p>Somehow we have worse numbers now that we had in April. Something changed and that's people going outside and having thanksgiving and christmas and holidays and travel and ignoring masks and social distancing etc. </p>
<p>People just aren't taking it seriously and it continues to spread, forcing the government to force people to stay home and creating the need for shutdowns, because people don't listen.</p>
<p>Every time I'm out and I see a person not wearing a mask, I see it as a vote, for a total statewide shutdown, or a vote for killing old people. If everyone does there part, no shutdowns and very few dead old people. </p>
<p>&rt; Why don’t you continue participating in this thread and keep an eye out for studies that we post. We can then argue point by point.</p>
<p>We have vaccines at this point, so there isn't really anything else left to discuss. Covid is a virus, it spread by air, it kills a certain group of people and not everyone, it existed for over a year with no vaccine, we only need one nationwide shutdown (paid by the government), then everyone since then should have limited group activities, stay home when you can, wear a mask when you are out and in groups, and socially distance. Super spreader events would be shut down until vaccines are widely used ie small packed bars, concerts, sporting events, etc, unless strict social distancing is put into place at said locations. </p>
<p>Then everything works until everyone gets vaccinated.</p>
<p>Now, here's the fun part. Sure there are people out there that think covid is fake, a hoax, bullshit, etc. People who refuse to wear masks, or take any of this serious. Who think the vaccine is mind control or has microchips or something else dumb in it. </p>
<p>Once enough people are vaccinated that won't matter. What will matter is that anyone who Isn't vaccinated will still be susceptible to the virus and can catch it and can die from it. </p>
<p>But that will 100% be on them and their choice. So in 1 year from today if some random person dies from covid and their facebook feed is full of anti-covid stuff, and they refused to take the vaccine. That is all them. That was their choice and covid is now in the same category as car crashes and heart disease and the flu. </p>
<p>It'll be your choice to die or not, to wear a seatbelt or not, eat healthy and excersie or not, get a flu shot or not, or get the covid vaccine or not.</p>

        <p>I’ve kissed girlfriends who are sick and have not gotten sick. I’ve made points about it to them as well. I haven’t been sick in a decade other than one incident with some aged goat cheese. I don’t get sick. I don’t allow my mind to be sick so it manifests a healthy body. I drink water, eat healthy and exercise. I have reason to be afraid of the world, I come from it.</p>
<p>Further, a cold is simply a detoxification of the body, not some contagion I can catch from another person. A virus is the excretion of a decaying cell. It is the effect of poor health, not the cause. A virus has never been proven to be contagious.</p>

        <p>Any proof, you are immune to viruses and will make big bucks helping deal with ebola outbreaks because you can operate much easier and faster without the need for extensive hazmat suits?</p>
<p>No, I don't have any proof of that. But you've implied your susceptibility to virus is high, so that means you won't get ebola, and don't need a hazmat suit.</p>
<p>And I do know that doctors and people who deal with high infectious diseaese get paied well because of the hazard pay. </p>
<p>So, the proof is what you said about yourself, and I guess I could pull up a pay chart of people working in an ebola outbreak. </p>
<p>But why would do you need proof from me, that you are immune to ebola or other viruses, you said are, so you know whatever proof you know to be able to tell me that fact about yourself.</p>

        <p>Character slander? My man, look at my comment history. I disagree with lockdowns and masks, but to say that viruses aren’t contagious is fucking bullshit and you know it. </p>
<p>Viruses replicate inside cells. They bind to marker proteins on the surface of those cells and inject their viral genome into the cell where it can either</p>
<p>A. Hijack cellular metabolic pathways to build copies of the virus. This is seen in Covid and the common cold. </p>
<p>B. Insert the viral genome into the nucleus of the cell where it becomes part of your DNA. At which point it can be replicated whenever your cell or a bacteria tries to divide. This is seen in Chicken pox, small pox, and scarlet fever. </p>

        <p>Please don’t tell me what I know or don’t know anymore. That’s a silly waste of your time and mine. It’s not bullshit. It’s a simple fact.</p>
<p>Viruses replicate inside decaying cells. They are the excrement <em>of</em> a decaying cell. The result, not the cause. Your explanation here (lecture, really) is based on the assumption that a virus is contagious. This is called germ theory and the father of germ theory, Louis Pasteur, agrees that the germ is not the issue, it is the terrain. </p>
<p>I used slander correctly. Thanks anyway. Please go research the germ theory hoax and learn something so we can all get through these trying times! Cheers.</p>

<p>And the technique used is electron microscopy. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2772359/#__sec1title">Here’s a paper on that as well</a></p>
<p>Now what’s your alternative theory? I hope you provide as many sources as I did</p>

<p>They probably go around demanding evidence the sun is powered by nuclear fusion. </p>
<p>But they are neither a doctor or a nuclear physicist. </p>
<p>How have they survived this long?</p>

        <p>You just asked for someone to prove a virus is contagious. </p>
<p>Then questioned the proof they showed you. </p>
<p>It’s been a well proven fact in science for a while and has been proven over an over in how medical science fights viruses. </p>
<p>Just questioning that fact makes me absolutely not respect you and deems you a person who deserves abuse and ridicule until you join the rest of us in the 21st century and accepts and understands basic scientific facts. </p>
<p>You have the entire internet and any doctor or scientist at a hospital more than willing to <strong>teach</strong> you about germs and viruses and bacteria and vaccines and modern medicine.</p>
<p>Yet, here you are on the internet spreading  garbage conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>I’ve been polite so far compared to how people <em>should</em> treat people like you.</p>

        <p>They didn’t show me proof. Was I supposed to just accept whatever they provided without question..? They showed me an article which explains how a virus is transmitted <em>assuming</em> it is contagious. Nothing about the article proves contagion. Further, simply presenting an article and demonstrate ones understanding of the topic is no way to have an argument. An article should be used as a source, not as a means of laziness. </p>
<p>Telling me something is proven and has been proven without being able to tell me how it is proven is an obvious sign that it has not been proven.</p>
<p>I could not give a single fuck less about your respect as I have absolutely no respect for people who resort to character attacks during a debate. It is the clear and obvious sign of a loser.</p>
<p>Germ theory is incorrect, and Louis Pasteur agrees with me. Modern academia has done a disservice to his research. </p>
<p>You have done a disservice to yourself. Go do some research noob.</p>
