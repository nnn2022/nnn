        <p>They discussed that the spike proteins are being cleaved off the cells and then travel throughout the body, but don't explain how they know that versus the nanolipids are just very efficient at carrying the mRNA to cells throughout the body and generating spike proteins everywhere they land. It's clear we're getting more information though and it's enough that all vaccines should be immediately stopped At the end the one guy talks about horrifyingly disfigured babies from late term miscarriages that doctors have never seen before. Media is silent on all.</p>

        <p>&rt;At the end the one guy talks about horrifyingly disfigured babies from late term miscarriages that doctors have never seen before</p>
<p>Why would one anecdote of an unnamed pregnant woman matter more than multiple phase 3 RCTs, which contained many women who got pregnant during the study?</p>
<p>The anecdote doesn't even make sense. The doctor has never seen anything like this ever yet are also completely confident it has nothing to do with the vaccine? How is this story even being relayed as vaccine related to Steve Kirsch if in the doctors mind the two events are completely unrelated.</p>
<p>"I saw the weirdest miscarriage the other day, btw it was with a patient who recently got vaccinated but it definitely had nothing to do with the story. I have no idea why it happened but it definitely wasn't the vaccine"</p>

        <p>I am not familiar with and have not heard that pregnant women were included in "multiple" studies. Do you have a link? And how did the babies fare? What was the miscarriage rate?</p>
<p>The anecdotal example was that the baby had severe bleeding and a brain split in half. Does that sound common to you? The reason it doesn't go down as vax related is, as he mentioned in the video - that there is such extensive brainwashing even of medical workers who have somehow been convinced these poison injections are safe.</p>

        <p>For sure. If you watch the entire discussion, you can tell how flustered Steve is regarding the situation. He tends to interrupt a good bit, but I think it was coming from his frustration on being duped into taking the vaccines. I honestly think Dr. Malone did a risk analysis of the situation and made his choice. I guess societal pressure probably played into it with the chances of his ability to travel being stifled.</p>

        <p>Why are they not talking about the concentration of circulating spike? That is extremely important. Recent study from Brigham and Women's showed extremely small values of full spike and S1 subunit within the blood. Similar studies showing toxic effects of spike proteins had concentrations thousands of times larger (pg vs mcg). This needs to be addressed.</p>

        <p>You are correct.</p>
<p>"X is very dangerous, it's cytotoxic!" is a completely unscientific thing to say without referencing dose. Almost everything is cytotoxic at some dose, that does not mean it is "very dangerous" or even "dangerous" when used at the correct dose.</p>
<p>Sunlight and Vitamin A are both cytotoxic (sunlight is cytotoxic AND carcinogenic), but both of them are beneficial for health in the right dose, because at the right dose the toxicity is minimal compared to the health benefit it provides.</p>
<p>The amounts of free floating spike protein created by mRNA vaccination is miniscule, at femtomolar levels, 100,000x less than the dose used in the study that shows cytotoxicity. there's no reason to think its going to kill you anymore than spending 10 minutes in UV light is going to kill you, or the trace amounts of arsenic in an apple are going to kill you.</p>
<p>If anything mRNA vaccines appear to be safer because they don't cause the rare immune reaction that adeno-virus based vaccines do that can cause brain bloodclots:</p>
<p>https://zenodo.org/record/4784787</p>
<p>&rt;The vaccine uses an engineered form of the spike protein that is fused to a transmembrane anchor. The transmembrane anchor allows the spike protein to appear on the surface or membrane of the cell, but it is held in place by the anchor. This prevents the vast majority of spike protein from drifting away while at the same time creates a fixed target for the immune system to recognize and develop antibodies against the spike protein [Corbett et al.,2020].</p>
<p>&rt;We conclude the vaccines do not produce enough freely circulating spike protein to induce vascular damage via the ACE2 receptor destabilization mechanism described in Lei et al.[2021]. On the contrary, the extremely low, femtomolar levels of circulating spike protein induced by the vaccine are unlikely to have any physiological relevance to vascular endothelial cells, while still allowing the immune system to develop a robust immune response to spike proteins. The presence of anti-spike antibodies may in fact serve to protect vaccinated individuals against not only SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also against spike-protein induced damage to the vascular endothelium. We speculate that this protection against spike protein-induced damage may in part explain why COVID-19 symptoms are much less severe in vaccinated individuals Rossman et al.[2021].</p>
<p>&rt;There is now a very large amount of empirical data available that clearly shows the benefits of all approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are far greater than the risks of extremely rare side effects. The data also is not consistent with the hypothesis that VITT is due to spike proteins, since the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not resulting in any reports of VITT. The data is, however, consistent with the hypothesis that side effects are due to inflammatory reactions to vaccine components in adenovirus vector-based vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt;Overall, we conclude that all approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines provide far more benefits than risks, and that the very rare risk of VITT from the AZ and JJ vaccines is not due to the spike proteins, which are a fundamental part of how the vaccines work, but is most likely due to specific details of the formulation of the vaccines.</p>
