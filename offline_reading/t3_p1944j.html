    <strong>My JNJ vaccine experience (so far)…</strong>
    <p><p>Hey all, this is a throwaway, but for some context I am a healthy, active, 22 year old male attending a top university in the United States. I’ve been lurking on this sub for a while. To be clear, I am not anti-vax per se, but rather I am against forced experimental gene therapy, mandated vaccine passports to participate in society, state-led propaganda, public fear mongering, and the government’s abuse of their emergency powers. </p>
<p>I wasn’t going to get the vaccine. I was actually super against getting it for my own philosophical reasons. But last Friday I was a coward and thought I would suck it up for workplace and travel purposes. Turns out, this was a huge mistake.</p>
<p>I felt fine the day of. The next day I got the “normal” flu symptoms, paired with a strange numbness and tingling in my feet and lower legs. There was occasional pain like a mix between a cramp and stepping on something sharp. The next day was more of the same, but a bit more intense. Now it is the third full day after taking the vaccine and my hands and lower arms are also now numb and tingling with occasional pain. </p>
<p>I went to the doctor earlier today. The first thing after I explained the situation, they recommended I report the situation to the CDC… (wtf I am trying to get diagnosed and heal and the first thing they said to do is report it?). Anyways, the doctor then repeatedly said that the vaccine is in me, they can’t take it out, and that I will have to ride it out. They didn’t think I have Guillian-Barre syndrome, but said it’s also really early on. They can do nerve testing but only after 14 days, and it’s apparently very invasive. Basically I was told it sucks to suck. </p>
<p>I am sharing my personal experience for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I was a coward and was coerced to get the shot. Don’t be like me and don’t be a coward. Stick to your guts and hold the lines. Please share my story so that I didn’t potentially screw myself over in vain. Hopefully I can save some people who are on the fence about it purely because of the new restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there’s anyone here that is a medical professional that may have an explanation, or anyone who has shared similar side effects, please reach out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If anyone has experience requesting a medical exemption for vaccines, please also reach out. I am not sure if this qualifies or not, but there is no chance in hell after this reaction I am getting any sort of jab again. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for hearing my story. Stay safe guys.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing - I'm a healthy 23M attending university in Canada, and its administration just announced a new policy where you either declare yourself vaccinated or be subject to covid tests 2x/week. It's ridiculous!</p>

        <p>The "2 covid tests a week" is ridiculous and excessive. It is "Lawfare", where they use the process to punish you.</p>
<p>It needs to be litigated.</p>

        <p>It sounds like you are an anti vaxxer if you don’t support mandatory vaccination.
It’s ok though we are the resistance. Hope you heal up soon! That sucks. Try a heavy metal detox</p>

        <p>I've seen a few posts here and there giving advice on dealing with the side effects, but I never saved any of them. </p>
<p>I would check out <a href="https://www.medscape.com/sites/public/covid-19/vaccine-insights/how-concerned-are-you-about-vaccine-related-adverse-events#">medscape</a>, where health profs post their concerns and often post things that worked for them. Many have symptoms for five, six months but eventually them seem to subside or change. Also check the vax-skeptic doctors, they're not too hard to find. It seems that the treatment for the vax is often similar to the treatment for the virus. After all, it's probably the same spike protein that's causing problems.</p>
<p>At least you are one-and-done, no second shot to worry about.</p>

        <p>Cilantro. Juice it and ginger together and knock that back for as long as possible. Also stop eating meat and starch and just eat fruits and veggies.</p>

        <p>You definitely need to avoid any inflammatory foods/drinks. Take vitamin B-1, B-6, and B-12 all of which are good for nerve damage. Magnesium is good too, but make sure it’s chelated so it’s easily absorbed.</p>
