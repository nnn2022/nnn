    <strong>Looking to move out the USA</strong>
    <p><p>I really don’t know if I should leave this country. More and more in seeing people around me completely fine with having another witch trials but with people who are against this nonsense. I’m 21 and have been planing to move but I’m not sure where? It’s like all the states are just as bad as the ones I don’t want to live In. </p>
<p>Is there no where to run from this? Should I be staying in California to help fight or will I just be a target?</p>
<p>I’ve no idea. Also if there a discord for this kind of community pls link it !</p></p>

        <p>I left the US and made a life in latin america for the last 2 years. Let me tell you, theres no other place. And thats not just patriotic chest beating. </p>
<p>Lets run thru the options; Other english speaking countries like Canada, England, Australia have no freedom and are going down. Other western european nations are suffering the same problems, then there is the language barrier that youll need 2-3 years to be fluent enough to fully assimilate. </p>
<p>Latin America has it's own problems with crime/corruption and you'd better be prepared to live a lifestyle that is less economically advantaged than your used to. </p>
<p>You could look at Asia, however the more developed nations like Japan and China can be xenophobic, and concepts like rights and individualism are not popular ideas. Most of the other asian nations are developing economies so unless your an english teacher (which is majority online now) or a digital nomad, your gonna have a hell of a time making a living. </p>
<p>Anywhere you go your going to be a foreigner, an immigrant. Even if you love your host nation, like me, this is always on the back of your mind. Everyone you meet will be different than you with an entirely different set of life experiences. Youll never fully "assimilate." Youll always be a foreigner even if your a permanent resident or citizen just based on where you grew up. </p>
<p>It takes time and commitment to establish yourself abroad. You start at the bottom with nothing. Then there is the question of whether you want your kids to grow up into a culture and nation that has nothing to do with you or where you come from. </p>
<p>The US is going to shit and everyone knows it but it is still YOUR country. And it will always be. No matter where you go or what you do, that will always be the case. Even if you forget your past and adopt a new culture and way of life, your formative years were spent in the US and youll carry around expectations, ideas and customs that are American. And once the US goes down, the whole world is going down. Nowhere is safe. </p>
<p>That being said, if you still want to leave, expect to trade one set of problems for another. For some the trade is worth it. For others, not so much.</p>

        <p>I love your response. To be very honest I want to just live in nature, I want to struggle and make my own means through trying to farm or live in a fucking forest so really I don’t mind going to a jungle in Brazil or some thing like that. But you’re right, the US will always be my home, and honestly I just want to leave to be able to save people. Maybe what I’m actually looking for is a protecting community.</p>

        <p>Ive thought those exact same things. I've thought of buying land in Chiapas or Guatemala but you gotta realize the people that come from those places, farmers, ranchers, etc., are the ones who leave and pay coyotes to smuggle them across the border. </p>
<p>Life there has existed in the same manner as it has for hundreds of years. Thats because its incredibly hard to get out. You make enough to survive and reproduce, and thats about it. Theres no opportunity or future there apart from doing the same thing thats been happening for 100s of years. </p>
<p>People there all have stories of political guerillas or narcos coming into town and terrorizing them. So even though the government might not be messing with you, that doesnt mean some heavily armed assholes wont come into town and ruin everybodys lives. </p>
<p>That being said, I'm still looking to buy a piece of land in guatemala. But this takes money. American dollars to be specific. So if I were you I'd save money until you have enough to buy somewhere, then GTFO before the dollar collapses. Which is what I'm doing.</p>

<p>wut</p>
<p>if we can get CA to do something about crime, trash and homelessness tbh it's not bad</p>
<p>ur a lil baby my dude (i don't mean like a whiner, you're just very young) so you are stuck in a bit of a weird bubble here i'm guessing. either tied to your parents social circle or CA's nutjob liberal youths. i live in long beach - and while it sucked here, there was plenty going on all throughout the pandemic. if there wasn't, i drove to Huntington or Seal Beach, out to the desert, Barstow, all places that were pretty much ignoring Cuckin Newsom. i went to speakeasy's locally, a restaurant that defied shutdown orders on new years eve, went wheelin', picked up golf, surfed for a few months straight at the start of pandemic when i lost my job....</p>
<p>i've lived all over the world. there's nowhere like the U S of fuckin' A. </p>
<p>you will find as life goes on, that where you live has very little to do with your quality of life. your freedom doesn't come from some greaseball in Sacramento. and plenty of other people in this great state feel the same way.</p>
<p>that said i'd move to Florida in a heartbeat lol</p>

<p>I think it’s just too liberal for me. I know some parts of California are fine, I don’t feel like I’m being threatened here at all. It’s just fucking EXPENSIVE. Also feels like the center of brainwashing?</p>

        <p>Honestly America is not that great. I like New York, maybe Chicago but that’s it really.
I live in the U.K. and the country has fallen to pieces with all this immigration and government bullshit. Spitting images is a perfect reflection of the U.K. now.
Asia is crap, boring and controlling. Africa poor, still hate us whites and they voodo on us. South Africa is not to bad but I still would not want to live there at all. You’ll have to chain me.
South America has high crime rate and a lot hate Americans but it’s probably the better place to live because in Lima for example there’s a lot of American companies coming in and bringing a lot of culture. I notice this because of how fat everyone got in a decade. Honestly people are warm there and food is great. Just be careful of thieves and certain areas.
Middle East is a shithole, unless your talking about Dubai or Qatar but then again who enjoys there laws and extreme heat with no nature.
Rest of the Middle East is just a war zone and will continue to be for thousands of years.
Europe by far the best even with the destruction of immigrantion and the economically by the eu it’s still an amazing place to live. Germany has Great healthcare, Sweden too plus the chicks are amazing 🤩.
A lot of remote places in the Scandinavia and nobody would bother going up to the north so if that’s what your looking.
Italy is great and Spain too but a big job scarcity. That’s why everyone is coming to the U.K. because it’s higher standard of living but that’s slowly turning into the biggest hood in the world. Every city is dirty and full graffiti with race wars. Harsh truth nobody wants to talk about. I live in Devon so I’m lucky but other parts of the U.K. not so much.</p>

        <p>Got out of CA 6 months ago, something we’ve wanted to do for a long time. We have 4 young children and moved all the way across the country to the reddest of red states, knew no one here, restarted our business, new schools for the kids, all new friends, networks, etc. Basically restarted our life. It was very difficult. We also haven’t regretted it once. I thank God every day that we had the means and the courage to take such a risk. The US is a huge country and is wildly culturally diverse. I encourage you to go visit some red states and see what you think!</p>

Any liberal place will be full of people who will hand your ass off to the gestapo at first chance. Not so much the same in red states/areas. I’m in NY and wish I could get outta here but I atleast have a place in the sticks with the good ole boys I can disappear to if necessary.

        <p>You don’t need to leave the country. Pick a red state with the climate and landscape you like and move. Friendly people, lots of good jobs to be had, and most importantly freedom.</p>
<p>That being said, please don’t fuck up our politics when you get here. Our states are free because of a healthy mix of conservative and libertarian values.</p>

<p>I don’t mean offense but it’s insane how brainwashed Californians are. I think Californians live under the delusion that California IS America, and is the best the country has to offer. Just the opposite is true. </p>
