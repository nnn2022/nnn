    <strong>I need help finding this video, a UK laywer made a video and posted it on Facebook, she was crying in the video saying that people in care homes who tested negative were denied food and water and killed with midazolam then when they died they were counted as COVID deaths</strong>
    <p><p>She was really upset, she also spoke about how what she was saying was getting censored and she knew someone who lost her job because she spoke up about it. She remembered a case where a man with a mild chest infection tested negative for COVID 4 times, then fully recovered, he was sent back to a care home, where he was intentionally denied medication, food and water and given midazolam until he died, then the care home counted him as a COVID death. Some real creepy shit.</p>
<p>My friend showed it to me on her phone 2 days ago, the video was around 15 minutes long but I do not use Facebook and don't know how to find/search for videos on there</p></p>

        <p>As I see it there are two possibilities here.</p>
<p>1)  She can back up what she is saying with facts.  In this case this is elder abuse and murder.  Why would no one file charges?</p>
<p>2) She can't back this up with any facts which makes this at best hearsay, and worst fiction.</p>

        <p>Yes it's true, my friend showed me the video on her phone 2 days ago, it was on Facebook but the woman in the video was a lawyer and she was crying, telling viewers that if they had relatives in nursing homes in the UK, to get them out. Video was about 15 minutes long.</p>
