    <strong>It's not just this shot, it's about all the ones afterward too.</strong>
    <p><p>The shot is about control. Sure having adverse side effects is an extremely valid reason to not get it, but that's not what we should be worried about. Once the governments of the world focus on the new strains you'll see new shots being pushed. What made you immune before won't make you immune now.</p>
<p>Naturally this will upset people. To avoid them feeling lied to/deceived/tricked the governments of the world need to give them a message:</p>
<p><strong>It's not your vault. It's the vault of the unvaccinated.</strong></p>
<p>That's when things get bad. I don't think we'll have forced vaccinations at the start but they WILL come. The governments of the world will tell people that unless every single person gets it, then there will be a new variant tomorrow. They will say that "We all must do our part to eradicate the virus. We're in this together."</p>
<p>It won't be camps and roundups at the start. No you'll lose access to fun things like bars, restaurants, theaters. Then you won't be able  to work without it. Then you won't be able to shop without it. You can still order groceries to be delivered to like a plague carrier, but even that too will end.</p>
<p>Before this is full realized we'll see war and conflict, which includes the upcoming American civil war. So you'll have that as a milestone at least. Society is fractured and I doubt we can come back without a great strife. And even with one, we may never come back at all. Sorry for the doomer talk, but I'm just observing the writing on the wall.</p></p>

        <p>France, Canada, Australia, the UK, and many other countries are racing ahead of us toward police state rule. Hopefully witnessing their turmoil, chaos and failure will be enough for the US to choose another route. And we still have armed citizens.</p>

        <p>They can only truly force it, once the majority of People have complied, and then can get away with it.</p>
<p>Much like the Mask, the government did little until making Mandates official because EVERYONE was doing it anyway.</p>
<p>Compliance is playing a huge part in this, as of course even the Devil must play by the rules: We must enter agreements with our own Free Will.</p>
<p>Who cares what your rights are, or what is legal, if you KNOWINGLY and OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL, comply to their wishes.</p>
<p>At that point, even under Heaven and Hell - an agreement is struck</p>

        <p>They have a problem with this scenario. They are essentially trapped right now. A UK nurse has verified that they are ensuring that all vax injured are to be tested and reported postive for Covid. This is going to send "breakthrough cases" through the roof.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the CDC changed the cycle count on the PCR test for vaccinated to a lower number than unvaccinated, thinking they had check-mated the unvaxxed, as the vaxxed people would come up Covid negative more than the unvaxxed. </p>
<p>But now they have a problem. They have boxed themselves in trying to use one lie to hide another. Suddenly, they NEED the vaxxed to come up positive to offer some sort of cover from all the injuries they have caused. This will ultimately lead to the hospitals full of vaccinated people with supposed Covid, thus destroying any notion that the vaccines work as promised.</p>
<p>This is why they are ramping up the pace of everything. They have so little time left to kill everyone or to die trying. The lies are about to burst like a Chinese dam.</p>
