    <strong>I want you all to know...Almost every religious Jew is on your side</strong>
    <p><p>I just wanted to put it out there. As an Orthodox Jew, I’m around a lot of others and I know the opinions of a majority of us. 
And if it helps you knowing that a few million more people agree with you, and are against this BS then your welcome.
We’re all fighting this.
I attend a shul (synagogue) and we originally had a mask Requirement, simply because they were a few outliers that agreed with this nonsense. However, after a few weeks of filing from everyone cumulatively we have successfully eradicated the rule of our synagogue. Mazel Tov 😂. Keep fighting brothers!</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I know, it’s crazy. Hundreds of thousands of people are moving out. I myself though not Hasidic or in NY am thinking about moving out of America. Not just being a jew, but what’s happening to America in general is getting scary. Idk man</p>

        <p>Hate that it’s come to this but that’s probably a good plan. Not Jewish myself but there seems to be an insane amount of antisemitism in the US now and I’ve seen it from the far left and far right. </p>
<p>The rhetoric is getting so bad in general too. People don’t even see the other political side as human. Scary times as this sort of stuff never ends well.</p>

        <p>This is a pretty much playing exactly as I thought it eventually would.  I don't see an actual hot war anywhere on the horizon but I'm almost certain that what happened in DC was just the beginning of an insurgency situation that will be causing problems for the rest of our lives at least.  With the changing economy, more and more people are going to be left out of any of the benefits it offers which leads to detachment, anger, desperation and ultimately violence.</p>

        <p>From conservatives or conspiracy types, it tends to come in the form of the old fashioned tropes of a cabal that controls everything behind the scenes.  On the left, it's framed around issues with Zionism but the stuff from the previous category seems to somehow bubble to the surface at times.</p>

        <p>I never encountered antisemitism on the east coast, but I did in the south once, my best friend's dad is black and some black / jew relations are not so great.  He was convinced that either I was hiding "jew gold" and pretending to be poor to take advantage of black people, or I was a failure a jew for being poor.</p>
<p>I encounter it more on the west coast, especially in portland.  In the city of tolerance I've gotten used to slurs like "kike," and "long nose," and have overheard conversations of colleagues talking about how Jews somehow ruined several aspects of their businesses.</p>

        <p>I’m,until very recently, worked in Hollywood. What’s disturbed me is that if I tell people that I work in the industry they will often start asking questions or just commenting in general about “the Jews”. I’d just as soon not repeat some of worst of it but it’s usually a mixture of:</p>
<p>“jews run a secret entertainment cabal to encourage race mixing and destruction of the white man” 
(usually right wingers but can be leftist white people as well) </p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>“Jews are responsible for all of the state of Israel’s actions and Israel has not right to exist, is the most terrible country ever” (left wingers, Muslims, and other minorities)</p>
<p>To me it’s bad enough they think that but what’s worrying is how free they feel saying it to me even if we’re not close. This is anecdotal of course but it worries me.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for the encouraging post! I’m happy to hear that your community is standing up to the bs. I remember reading about the atrocities what happened to Jewish people in WWII in history class and now these things like quarantine camps and neighbors spying on neighbors and saying masks is “just a piece of cloth,” it sounds so similar.</p>

        <p>Well I’ll have to disagree on that point. I don’t believe it is a contradiction with being religious in protecting themselves. For the same reason I a religious person, won’t jump in front of a moving car. We call it in Judaism השתדלות which basically means do your part and the rest is up to God. 
I don’t believe masks do anything that’s why I’m against all of this. And thank u for fighting back as well!🙏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏽🙏🙏🏾🙏🏿</p>

        <p>Would you jump in front of that car to save your child?   I'm not suggesting you are careless with your life.  I believe God wouldn't want us to allow oppression.  Bad things happen when good people do nothing.  I was simply suggesting to gather at your church in full force without the mask.</p>

        <p>It kind of sounds like you got a hang up.  Fundamentalists of all religions have that same mindset of being in opposition to the rest of society.  The complexities of the state of Israel are out of scope of what can be covered in a casual reddit comment though.</p>

        <p>Excuse me, are you implying that all Jews are taught to see “non-believers” as not human? </p>
<p>I’m Jewish, and I was not taught that nor have I ever, ever personally heard any other Jew, from reformed to orthodox, express such sentiment. Some extreme orthodox groups, like the Hasidic communities, are rather elitist - but they are equal-opportunity elitists, and view <em>everyone</em> outside of their communities, including other Jews, as inferior. Those groups also stick entirely to themselves, tend to be poor (they certainly do not control anything, least of all the media), and want only to be left alone to live as they see fit. </p>
<p>But perhaps I’m not as educated about Jews as you are. After all, I haven’t even grown horns ... maybe I’m a bad Jew?</p>

        <p>All the reform synagogues seem to be following all orders including masking and or not meeting indoors. It’s very depressing. It seems to align with political views, as these are the same people who are mostly democrats. I am hoping they end this BS soon.</p>

        <p>I'm not Jewish but my girlfriend is. We sometimes will go to synagogue together and she is Reform. It is closed to in person services. When it did open for some time, it was very restricted - seating was spaced out, temperatures taken, contact list filled out, hand sanitizer used before and after, no oneg, no challah or wine given to attendees.</p>
<p>We finally just said to hell with it. We observe Shabbat by ourselves now anyway.</p>

<p>Do you have any insights into what's going on in Israel?  I know Netanyahu jumped the queue by paying the pharmaceutical companies:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9128233/Israel-paid-jump-vaccine-queue.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9128233/Israel-paid-jump-vaccine-queue.html</a></p>
<p>But what's going on?  They've vaccinated 1/5 of their population which I'm assuming are the vulnerable.  What are your insights?</p>
<p>*Edit: I know not all Jewish people hail from Israel or know what's going on in Israel.  Just asking for the sake of asking if you happen to have any information.</p>

<p>Someone just responded to one of my comments here with a statement that Jews are a monolithic race pushing communism for others. </p>
<p>The comment was deleted just before I responded, but when someone is so blatantly antisemitic (or racist, etc) as this, perhaps banning is more appropriate than individually removing their hatemongering comments.</p>
<p>This sub is rapidly becoming a haven for antisemites and bigots. I’ll try to get this sub banned myself if it continues in this direction. This is unacceptable, even if only because this sort of ignorant trash <em>hurts</em> opposition to the new normal by making potential advocates dismiss us as crazy racists and return to supporting lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Glad to hear it. There are certain Jewish government officials who are hard pushing this such as Netanyahu but that’s the duality of man, there are good and bad people among all religions and races. I’ve heard of Orthodox Jews who protest Israeli occupation too, hope you’re in that camp too.</p>

        <p>If that’s the case after all this time I understand that I’ll be unable to change your mind. Nevertheless I feel it wouldn’t be a waste to say why I believe Israel is unjustified in all of its action since 1948.</p>
<p>1.Palestinians never drove Israelis from their land. Only Israelis have done that. The grudge of the Jewish there cannot be with Palestinians as they’ve never driven away Jews throughout history.</p>
<p>2.Israel isn’t the victim, the balance of power swings way in Israel’s favor. Israel could destroy what’s left of Palestine in a day whereas the Palestinians couldn’t take out a single town with everything they’ve got. </p>
<ol>
<li>What justifies the starvation and military occupation of a people who never harmed your people? Hamas didn’t exist before Israelis invaded, its reactionary. Terrorism is evil, but the first bullet of terrorism was fired by Jewish settlers. Since you’ve done a lot of research you’ve surely heard of the massacres which occurred to create the Israeli state. Killing of civilians in mass numbers not combatants. </li>
</ol>
<p>As I said in the beginning nothing I say will convince you at this point. It’s like talking to a Biden or Trump supporter, they cannot see any flaws. There are many here who are against the New Normal but support the military suppression of their government when its directed at other people. It seems that’s what you believe, I guess we’ll agree to disagree. If you get into an argument with a Doomer just remember if they know your viewpoint they can exploit it as a contradiction, where totalitarianism is alright against others but not alright at home.</p>

        <p>Jews, much like blacks, and whites, and Hindus, and Christians, are in fact a rather diverse group. There is no universal “Jewish” stance on this or anything else. </p>
<p>It is encouraging that OP’s synagogue has rejected the new normal, and I appreciate OP’s sharing positive information like this ... but no Jew can speak for all Jews, just as no woman can speak for all women and no black person can speak for all black people.</p>
