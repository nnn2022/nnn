    <strong>I'm genuinely scared to get the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I'm just very hesitant to get a vaccine that was rushed out and made in under 1 year. Ontop of that, there is alot of lies and mistrust that goes on in the government. Why should I all of the sudden just blindly trust a vaccine that came out of nowhere that protects us from a virus that came out of nowhere? Ontop of that there is so many nefarious global actors that run the world that don't give a fuck about us civilians and will do anything to gain more power over us.</p>
<p>Official CDC website shows timeline that shows it took 10 years go create and perfect the flu vaccine. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pandemic-timeline-1930-and-beyond.htm ..... so why should I trust a vaccine that was created in under a year?</p>
<p>The disgusting pedophile (who went to Epstines Island multiple times and lied about it) who goes by the name Bill Gates aided in the help of creating the vaccine. He was once quoted saying "we have too many people on this earth" when talking about population control. Why would I trust a pedophile?</p></p>

        <p>Follow your gut. I have worked in healthcare for decades and I have never felt as strongly about anything as I do this vaccine. I’ve taken lots of vaccines and quite frankly I’m sick of having to say this every time someone calls me an anti-Vaxer. People who call anyone who is using their brain to make decisions selfish, weigh pros and cons, consider your own personal health and situation… Well I don’t care what they think of me anymore. If they want this for themselves that’s fine but there are plenty of reasons why I will not be taking this. The absolute arrogance and nerve of somebody just barking at you, take the vaccine! It is appalling. How dare you order me around and tell me what to do when it comes to my own personal health. Who do these people think they are? First of all they lack any intellectual curiosity whatsoever. They take everything that’s fed to them and don’t ask any questions. They are fear based and afraid of being outcasts like us. Anyone who does ask questions is called an idiot. I heard one media personality say just take the vaccine the CDC and government have done all the work for you you don’t even have to think! Why the hell would people not want to think? Does it hurt their brains that much to think? Since when is this a bad quality or something difficult?We are in an upside down world right now. If you don’t want this for yourself don’t take it. There are millions of people who do not want it but they want you to feel alone and they want you to feel intense pressure. If everyone was taking this as they are trying to make us believe, they would not be offering people french fries and weed and lap dances and lottery tickets. They are desperate and it’s obvious. If this really was such a dire situation and the vaccine was that great you wouldn’t have to do all this to get people to take it. They would be getting in line for their shot. This is bullshit and anyone with a brain in their heads knows it.</p>

        <p>They might have been talking about chasing the universal flu vaccine.  The ones we get aren't 40-60% effective against the strains they pick.... the problem is it's all a kind of forecasting.  They predict which of the thousands of types of flu will be around, and give you the shot by their best guess.  It will protect you from that variant, but if 60% of the cases are another species, then it's 0% effective.</p>
<p>They basically have like a 40-60% chance that they guessed right.  If they are wrong they can linger a bit and help you in later years, but they are essentially a stupid lottery.</p>

<p>Not quite true.  As I understand it, even if they get the dominant strain guess wrong (iirc they pick 2-3 each year) there is still some resistance conveyed because of cross-strain immunity.  Our immune systems are surprisingly good at reducing the severity of diseases whose relatives we have encountered.  Traditional vaccines exploit this to provide some pretty good coverage even in poor years by intentionally picking more disparate strains.  (MRNA spike protein shots to VERY poorly at this by not using the entire virus strand.)</p>

        <p>That makes a lot of sense. The one time I did get the flu was during the two year period I didn’t get the shot, and it was bad. I thought I was gonna die at one point, but to be fair I can be a little dramatic. However when I got COVID it was more annoying than anything else. I had to basically sleep sitting up so I could breathe at night.</p>

<p>Yes but he also aided in the creation of the new Xbox. If they start handing out an Xbox series X for getting double stabbed, I may give in after all.</p>

        <p>There are lot of vaccines developed abroad they not allowed to use. You may pretend you want that vaccine and demand it instead of approved. You may pretend you already vaccinated abroad (with document) and vaccine is incompatible with what government pushes to your arm. Imagine, real free country exists on Earth and they developed vaccine people really like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saline injection. Of course, it won't be called straight, let's it be Ronabust.</li>
<li>Ronabust is 99.7% effective, but minor disadvantage - it's incompatible with all major vaccines (you will get seizures, could gonna berserk or something like this). This is official disclaimer - no re-vaccination with ... long list of shit to avoid.</li>
<li>All above is hard science, as scientific as millions of faucis, tons of peer reviews, shitload of papers (in that country)</li>
<li>Vaccine passport that fit even in dumbphone, no smartphone required! It works like this - you call dedicated toll-free number registered in that country and robotic voice tell you John Doe is indeed vaccinated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our problem is - no such country exists.</p>

        <p>You shouldn't have to be. If society were normal, you would be able to wait a couple years and see how the rollout goes. But the fact that there is so much pressure is alarming in itself.</p>
<p>If you're nervous, trust your gut. Revisit the topic every couple weeks and check in on your feelings. No big decision should ever be made under stress, if it can be avoided.</p>

        <p>There is no reason to be afraid of the vaccine. Side effect chances are extremely low.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean I think you should take it.</p>
<p>It just means I don't think people need to be afraid of it.</p>
<p>If you are high risk, by all means take it.</p>
<p>If you are low risk, pretty much depends on if you think you actually need it.</p>
