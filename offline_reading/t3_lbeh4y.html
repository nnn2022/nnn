        <p>Yeah that's what upsets me the most.</p>
<p>Having a mask on for a little bit isn't a big deal but employees wearing them for hours is STUPID AF. First off, it's degrading and unwarranted, secondly, if one of those employees is sick, send them fucking home. If they are sick the mask isn't going to stop them from spreading a contagious disease when the wearer is in the same room for 8+ HOURS</p>
<p>Sorry it's just too ridiculous to take seriously.</p>
<p>What should happen logically is employees only wear masks for brief periods when directly interacting with customers, otherwise optional.</p>

        <p>The better thing to do would be to roll back all this F.U.D. that has been pushed about CoVid-19, start smacking doctors on the butt about lying to the populace about the risks of this weak-sauce disease, and move on.</p>
<p>The only thing we needed to do with CoVid-19 was encourage or require people to take Vit. C, Vit.D and Zinc supplements. That's it! That is all people need to survive this not-deadly-at-all-to-the-majority disease.</p>

        <p>I rarely wear one.  Sure if a customer is on the aisle with me I'll pull mine up but other than that no fucking way.  The funniest things to me is do people really think we wear them in the back room?  The break room?  LOL... we do not.  Do they think we wash our hands religiously?  No we do not.  Do you think the night crew even bothers with masks?  No they do not.  Take a bunch of minimum wage workers who might get a .50 cent raise a year if they're lucky and try to make them sterilize themselves like a surgeon?  It aint happening folks.  Oh hey all you people scared to death of COVID?  you might want to skip buying any produce.  We bare hand that shit all the time.  Thank you for shopping at my store LOL Funniest thing is I got told I should be careful about my postings on reddit because I could get fired for telling the truth.  So what? I don't need the fucking job anyway.  I just do it to stay fit and socialized in my retirement years.  I can find something else to do.  But hey... off to work to handle your food with dirty hands and no mask.  Sleep well you covid karens.</p>

        <p>My supervisor did that a lot in the beginning. I had to wear a mask AND a face shield. "Pull your mask up" Why? I'm sitting here alone! And when I'm not alone, it's only 1-2 other people over ten feet away from me. That went away as soon as the other directors realized they had to do it too. Now it's "wear a mask if you leave your desk and can't be socially distant".</p>

<p>All that language tells me the lockdowns were designed for the people who work in industries where you don't need to be out and about. If you own or work at a small business, if you're an independent contractor (like a painter or a carpenter)? Tough luck. You don't really exist. You don't really matter. Oh, what do you mean wearing a mask for 10 hours is different than for 10 minutes? What do you mean you've interacted with the public every day for hours and not gotten sick?</p>

        <p>I hate the whole, ‚Äúif I can do it, you can too‚Äù thing. I‚Äôm a high schooler on my school‚Äôs wrestling team. We have to wear masks during wrestling practice and also during matches. That‚Äôs a really intense workout in the first place, and wearing the mask makes it significantly harder. And yet I would never use that to tell someone that ‚ÄúI wear a mask while doing XYZ, so you shouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it!‚Äù It‚Äôs just basic empathy and human decency to understand that what‚Äôs easy and doable for some might be very difficult for others, and it scares me that we are losing that empathy.</p>

        <p>Do these "experts" actually know how the respiratory system works? Let's just skip to the step involving the aveoli.  This is where the exchange of gasses occur so that we can EXHALE the CO2. So, if I am wearing a mask (especially all day) I'm breathing back in the CO2 that I'm supposed to be exhaling/getting rid of. When I sneeze or cough (because we do that even if we are not sick) most of it passes right through the mask (I know because I tested it) but the mask is still wet and I'm breathing it back in plus it rubs against my skin.  Masks are an inconvenience and a health risk. But who am I to challenge the "experts"?</p>
