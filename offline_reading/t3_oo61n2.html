        <p>He's right about speed limits. Accidents happen, but the risk of death rises exponentially as the speed at which an accident happens increases.</p>
<p>I'm not saying we should lower speed limits... I'm saying life is a risk, and it's part of being human.  People are using this fake virtue of "saving lives" in order to selfishly impose total authoritarianism over <em>everyone</em>.</p>
<p>Worst of all is the people turning our countries upside down have the nerve to call <strong>us</strong> <em>selfish</em>.</p>
<p>I'm glad Greenwald is finally speaking out a bit on the matter. A lot of lockdown enthusiasts and passport proponents are big fans of that guy. Maybe a few will wake up from this weird trance they're in.</p>

        <p>Can't remember if it was five or ten thousand more deaths per year with the 65 mph speed limit over the 55 that they tried to make the national standard back in the late 80s. But they decided getting to the mall before closing was more important and they scrapped the whole thing.</p>

        <p>This is based on outdated studies. Faster speed limits can save lives. It’s speed differentials that lead to more deaths.</p>
<p>Turns out it’s the slower drives that cause accidents more. But people blame it on faster speeds when if the idiot going slower didn’t fuck shit up, there wouldn’t be a problem</p>

        <p>Haha, spoken like someone who drives recklessly.</p>
<p>No, it is an objective fact that if you have two accidents and one happens at a lower rate of speed and the other happens at a higher rate of speed --- on average, the fatality rate increases as the speed increases.</p>
<p>The rest of your speed-demon nonsense :-) sounds great on paper except it doesn't account for the real life fact that:</p>
<ul>
<li>mechanical failure is inevitable</li>
<li>human failure is inevitable</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of just driving at a reasonable speed, you floor it, tell yourself you're saving lives by driving faster, and then get mad at everyone else when you crash into a van and kill a bunch of children.</p>
<p>But your unnecessary use of profanity and name calling makes you come across as an abrasive person and I don't actually care enough about the issue to discuss it further so...</p>
<p>Speed on, speedster.</p>

<p>Drive right, pass left, yield to faster traffic. It works for the Autobahn. How is that reckless?</p>
<p>What's reckless is parking in the left lane at the speed limit while people pass on the right because you're an impediment to the flow of traffic.</p>
<p>When you move to the left lane and force a faster vehicle to jam on their brakes, you're reckless.</p>
<p>When you hit the brakes to merge instead of the gas pedal, you're not reckless but you're a bad driver who slows down everyone else and impedes the flow of traffic.</p>

        <p>Yeah I don't even disagree with this. </p>
<p>I think my main point is -- yes, these people exist on the road so it's important not to go too fast because you can't assume they won't be there.</p>
<p>There's a big problem in my area with high speed collisions. Caused by, slow people on the road.</p>

        <p>Faster speeds make accidents more dangerous but not more likely. Most accidents happen at low speeds. Speed limits were introduced to reduce gas usage during the oil crisis and safety was an ex post facto explanation.</p>

        <p>The only problem with what you are saying is that he is right and you are wrong as fuck lmfao</p>
<p>Slow drivers are dangerous and cause more accidents, you can find numerous studies that prove this with a quick google search. In addition to being a road hazard, they tend to be really fucking annoying about it, insisting they’re being “safe” by congesting traffic and endangering others who are forced to overtake them.</p>

The easier you make driving, the worse the drivers, as anyone who has ever travelled or lived in the USA, the land of the automatic transmission land barges and of some of the worst drivers in the world can attest.</p>

        <p>You know I used to think that US had terrible drivers too, and while that still is true of many in the tri-state area, after doing some traveling across the globe I've come to appreciate that we are not nearly as bad as some other places out there. The biggest problem here is distracted driving, but compared to other countries most people at least know 'how' they should drive, and that the laws of the road are often enforced.</p>

        <p>Yes, but currently in newer cars this is around 80mph.  Thus speed limits max put at 70-75.</p>

        <p>I guess things vary depending on where you live. Contrary to what might have been assumed by my other responses, no I'm not a "slow driver." I'm just acknowledging that they exist.</p>
<p>I have a wife and 4 kids. I have a lot more to lose than the kids I see on the highway weaving through traffic at high speeds, often beyond 100mph. </p>
<p>I live in San Diego and it is madness. I see an overturned/rolled car at least once a week and I don't even leave the house that often. People drive aggressively, make swift lane changes without checking to see if anyone's in their blind spots. They're all masked up in their cars because they care so much about everyone while simultaneously exceeding the already high speed limits by 10, 15, 20+ miles an hour putting everyone's families at risk.</p>
<p>And no, car accidents at 80mph are not safe. I have to get out of this conversation because it's absurd. Goodbye.</p>

        <p>Well there's one issue. In america only like 40k die a year from car crashes. And like how many of those are from speeding? It's just too different a cost benefit analysis (if you believe the death numbers).</p>

        <p>Yeah, honestly I didn't mean the speed limit issue to take off. It needs a forum of its own, lol. The thread where arguments happened just shows how irritable we're all getting with external issues.</p>
<p>But it goes back to the "even one death is too many!" thing, like in Australia, where they lockdown entire cities every time someone sneezes.</p>
<p>With that logic we wouldn't have cars. We wouldn't have anything. Life is a risk.</p>

        <p>Yeah but we do draw a line somewhere with risks. Like we wear seatbelts and have to have insurance, etc. </p>
<p>Just to be clear I am probably against mandatory vaccines, lock downs and the rest. </p>
<p>I just think that comparing a hypothetical death toll of 300k or whatever they say it is to like less than 30k doesnt have the argumentative force needed to properly combat the new normal. </p>
<p>That being said, there being less force doesnt mean no force. Like you point out, the whole even one life thing is an argument that is used for lockdown and stuff and that argument does pretty much suck. </p>

        <p>Seat belt laws are a perfect example of incrementalism.</p>
<p>People back then said, "No! We can't legislate that! Next thing we know they'll be legislating ______."</p>
<p>And then insurance? Oh boy. The auto insurance industry caused extreme inflation in repair prices... Just like the private medical insurance industry caused extreme inflation in medical prices.  I mean -- that's basic economics, but the way you just casually mention those things like:</p>
<p>"We do those, so we can do this."</p>
<p>THAT is exactly what people are warning about with incrementalism.</p>
<p>And this idea of Covid deaths being a problem... God i just don't have time to dispel that right now. </p>
<p>Short version? Old people die. Always have. Sick people who don't take care of themselves die. Always have.</p>
<p>But there was also a worldwide population boom \~80 years ago... It was significant enough that population growth jumped from 750,000 a year to over 3,000,000 a year in the US.  You realize life expectancy is \~79, right?</p>
<p>Another way to put it is... If you have baby boomers, you have to expect them to become death boomers 79 years later. Think about it.</p>
<p>The people in power are taking advantage of this increase in deaths to make people think the world is ending.  It isn't... Unless <em>they</em> end it...</p>

        <p>Incrementalism or by another phrase, slippery slope, is both a valid argument but also a logical fallacy. Its veracity depends on the strength of the links in the chain. Each one analyzed separately to see if there is in fact a stopping point. </p>
<p>The argument against gays for a long time was well if gays then inevitably pedophilia, bestiality, polyamory! Maybe we think such an argument unfair to gay people.</p>
<p>So while there might be good arguments against seatbelts, insurance, w/e. Society is likely better for having these things. The number of people protected by these slight inconveniences is likely greater than the burden. As a society we did a cost/benefit analysis and chose implementation. </p>
<p>Is that not fair?</p>

        <p>It's true.</p>
<p>And the bigger point is we don't do that because collectively we decided the risk/reward of that decision isn't worth it.</p>
<p>Without debating THAT issue -- the bigger point is ...</p>
<p>These "one Covid-19 death is too many" policies are absurd.  It's an inconsistent obsession with one issue, driven by media, corporations, and government.</p>
<p>Because the same people who advocate for perpetual lockdowns, mandatory masks, and mandatory vaccines would never agree to a 40 mph speed limit... Simply because it hasn't been propagandized to them.</p>
<p>If media and government ran 24/7 coverage on traffic accidents? Their opinions would change.</p>
<p>The point is -- they don't have their own opinions, their opinions are programmed through screens.</p>

        <p>&rt;Except when they made more beds (a field hospital) in the UK from 0, they were a waste of time and weren’t used.</p>
<p>Because there wasn't enough staff (it takes an enormous level of staff to man ICU beds) and it was logistically impossible to transport patients to those field hospitals. In the UK, field hospitals weren't ICUs which meant they didn't stop ICU beds from being full up. We're talking about ICU hospital beds being full up. </p>
<p>Hospital beds were full up and this is backed by UK data. The local hospital had their ICU beds full up - my dad works in the hospital as a Doctor and he confirmed this to me.</p>
<p>&rt;And when it all started the mantra was saving lives because covid is super dangerous totally not a flu.</p>
<p>No, it wasn't. </p>
<p>In the UK, the government published a list of groups that were vulnerable. </p>
<p>And covid isn't the flu. The r0 rate is much higher than the flu if I remember correctly. </p>
<p>Plus, we vaccinate against the flu. This supports the point because people weren't vaccinated from Coronavirus in the same way they are from the flu.</p>
<p>&rt;There’s literally no winning here</p>
<p>Your arguments weren't strong in the slightest. It feels like you're not a healthcare professional nor are you in the health field. I'll apologise if I'm wrong but that's my suspicion at the moment because it seems like you don't understand the difference between ICU beds and hospital beds.</p>

        <p>He is skipping one thing in the equation which is the risk factor. I don't like going from speed value to deaths directly. In real life it's all decoupled, randomly distributed with probability.</p>
<p>example =&rt; if there's a 40km/h limit, I could succesfully go 160km/h without killing anyone. I can repeat it unknown amount of times from crashing into someone at the first take, to never crashing.</p>
<p>The most scary thing is how investment in crash barriers is calculated (there are many types with different ability to consume energy safely) ... Not enough deaths per year and you can forget about an expensive barier installed on your way to work.</p>
<p>I think we are not gods of life and death so as far as the limit goes, this needs to be set to a reasonable speed. We all have a rough idea of what it is. I think that the current system works (would be hard to improve it), I just wish the polititians were unable to slip from the net.</p>

        <p>Wrong. It’s speed differentials that lead to more deaths. Risk of death per accident is a stupid metric if you don’t also include chance of accident even occurring </p>
<p>The autobahn is a perfect example. </p>
<p>Also, by your logic, planes shouldn’t be allowed to exist. </p>
<p>Yeah, the risk of death is greater at higher speeds, but number of accidents can be reduced at higher speeds as well. </p>
<p>Higher speeds leads to more spread out traffic and less accidents. Unless some idiot is going super slow and fucks it up. </p>
<p>It isn’t as simple as a speed limit, and if you think it is, you’re an old idiot</p>

        <p>That's not the point. The point is that risk-benefit analysis seems to inform basically any other policy besides coronavirus policy, which is informed solely by fear and rhetoric.</p>
<p>If you were to propose a radical set of regulations to fix some other health and wellness issue, this example being car accident deaths, there would be a big pushback based off of the costs and drawbacks, in this case reduced productivity and logistics capacity. That pushback, in any other case besides coronavirus, would have an impact on the resulting policy decisions. The push against coronavirus regulations, despite theapparent economic, social, and medical harm of these regulations, is not having an impact on coronavirus policy because coronavirus policy is informed by fear, not a weighing of the consequences.</p>

        <p>That's of course the weakest point of the Covid response - it's reactive, not based on solid knowledge, there's absolute lack of perspective and risk-benefit thinking.</p>
<p>I think entire roads analogy is very deceptive; more different than not. But if you extend my take about the roads, the takeaway for Covid could be: everyone to live a reasonable lifestyle, not overly cautious, no new normal, just watch out for the grandpas just in case, cause there's a v2.0 flu flying around, a few people may die but if you don't live your life, you are dead already... Just for instance.</p>

        <p>Yeah, because so many people would obey a lower speed limit.</p>
<p>Other things that could help save lives are systems that prevent movement if the driver's seat belt is not in use, putting several yards between roads intends for opposing directions, fixing roads in a timely manner without endless surveys &amp; studies, not making vehicles without roll cages, and outlawing motorcycles. I once read something about how lawns along paved roads should be mowed in a such a way that the clippings aren't blown into the road because they're potentially slippery to motorcycle tires. This from motorcyclists who choose to ride without helmets.</p>

        <p>It still stun me to see seemingly intelligent people like Greenwald not being able to see the truth...the covid tyranny has nothing to do with managing risk or protecting anybody...it's actually quite the opposite...its so crystal clear that it is about total domination and control of the human species with the ultimate goal of destroying it.</p>

        <p>I think covid may be another thing that pushes some left wing people closer to the center. Free speech was/is a big one starting a while back. Greenwald and Jimmy Dore seem to get along with libertarian types alot more than most leftists in the left online world, and this sort of thing definitely contributes to it. Jimmy Dore actually stood up for Alex Jones more than any right winger even.</p>

        <p>And it's not even like all the deaths are on one side of the equation. Yes, some people have died of covid (not as many as the official numbers, but not zero). But others have died from the lockdown and vaccines. So we're not weighing some deaths versus certain costs without deaths. We're weighing some deaths versus certain costs WITH other deaths.</p>

        <p>Since everyone heard what he said, I'd say the censors, if any.  aren't very effective. Why does anyone  exercise the right to speak out against authority, then be all indignant  when authority talks back at you?  AFAIK  Joe Rogan is not under arrest for what he said. That's what happens with real censorship. </p>
<p>Risk benefit is what the government response is all about. And they unfortunately have to include the risk that some people, when pushed "too far" get indignant and then refuse to comply with anything,  (That's why we scrapped most mask mandates despite having no vaccine approved for children.,IMHO. )</p>

        <p>YouTube said last year they would remove anything that disagrees with the CDC. Just because not every single thing is censored immediately doesn’t mean censorship doesn’t exist. And there was absolutely no risk benefit analysis done or else we wouldn’t have had lockdowns in the first place</p>

        <p>If we were a socialist country with socialist social media, you would have a point. But this is America, private enterprise rules, and YouTube has a right (obligation, if Trump had his way) to censor whatever they want. There are plenty of other places to post your ideas.</p>
