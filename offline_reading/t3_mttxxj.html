    <strong>Lockdowns left me destitute and miserable, and I don't know how to pick up the pieces. Any advice would be appreciated.</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry if this isn't the appropriate subreddit to post in but you're one of the few online forum boards that aren't fucking brainwashed and so I need some input from sane people.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic hit, I had just graduated college and was in an awesome internship and had made friends and was in a relationship in California living my best life. I literally was on the road to happiness. And then the pandemic began and lockdowns started and I lost my job, I couldn't pay for housing, so I had to move back in with my parents. My life quickly spiraled down from there. My Parents (somehow) got jobs overseas, and couldn't take me with them, so I had to move out of my parents house with little savings and no job openings in the middle of the worst national crisis since 9/11.</p>
<p>I eventually found a room in a basement to rent and a shitty cashier job to get me by....but I've been struggling ever since last March. Despite everyone I know being vaccinated all of my friends are brainwashed and don't wanna hang out in person...not even outside ffs. If we hang out online and the topic of the pandemic comes up they just want "harder lockdowns daddy pls!! &lt;:O". My family that is still stateside is the same way. So I've spent the past year alone and poor and miserable and losing it slowly everyday.. I just go to work; get bitched at by customers; come home and watch T.V. and fall asleep staring at a dark ceiling while I reminisce about my old life before in 2019.</p>
<p>I...I don't know what to do. I really don't. I'm at a straight loss. The only saving grace I have is that my lease ends soon and I have about 10k saved; so im considering potentially moving to a state that might be open. But other than that, I don't know how to even begin fixing my life.</p>
<p>Sorry for all who thinks I'm just whining I needed to get this off my chest and hopefully get some advice from people who aren't covidmongers.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly sounds like you’re in a prime position to start over somewhere else. You have some savings, move out of CA. I’m telling you it’ll be the best thing. I’m not saying it’s easy but you’re young, and you can move to an open state that has an actual reasonable cost of living. Good luck out there, you’ll be alright you sound very resourceful.</p>

        <p>We're in different countries and different situations but yours seems very similar to mine. I know I could move or emigrate and I could get a job and maybe a mortgage or buy some land but the more I look into everything that's really going on with the great reset, I wonder if there's any point.</p>

        <p>Sorry you’re going through it, but I understand. Imo I would talk to someone in your family or close friend who is awake about you moving out of state and their opinions. If you’re the only one awake to the lies, then I would plan your new beginning in a lifted state that ignores all propaganda to the best of their ability like South Dakota, Florida, etc. also consider a possible career you’re interested in and see if the location you choose has a high enough job rate that you have a good chance once future schooling or trade school is finished. If neither of those are your route then I would look up potential jobs in the area, apply for a ton, score a remote interview, explain the moving situation to the new potential job and if something works out, pull the trigger and dip out. You only have one life and CA will always be asleep and pro tyranny so imo I would want to start a new family line without brainwashing. I’m sure you will figure it all out, but stay strong man. Many of us feel alone in this fight. Seek the Lord’s face while he may be found is my best advice. I probably wouldn’t even be alive if it wasn’t for my faith in Jesus. Not pushing anything, just a suggestion. Take care, you got this :)</p>

        <p>Move to the panhandle or west coast of Florida if you like the beach life and being around lots of people. I hear that a lot of central and east coast FL isn't as free. I lived in the panhandle for years and absolutely loved it. I had a 1 bd/1bath single home for only $500/mo that was a short walk to a park right on the bay. The beach was a ten minute drive. I just up and moved there away from family and friends and I did great. Stayed until I met someone and married. </p>
<p>I'm probably moving back there in just a few more years. The panhandle gets a lot of hurricanes, so I'm thinking west coast FL this time. I'm also considering GA and SD. Haven't made up my mind yet. </p>
<p>Good luck to you. None of that was whining. 2020 made life unbearable for many people.</p>
