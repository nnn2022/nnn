    <strong>Hello there</strong>
    <p><p>Hello. I found this subreddit a good while ago and I would like to see the full extent of what this subreddit is about. This is not an argument, more like an interview. If anyone  more knowledgeable and well versed in these areas could share their opinions/thoughts on covid-19, reactions by the general public and politicians, thoughts on the reasons behind lockdown, vaccines, etc.</p>
<p>While I do not hold these beliefs personally, I feel like simply ignoring people you don't agree with is a massive detriment and shortens one's worldview.</p>
<p>I would like to hear from anyone knowledgeable in this community.</p></p>

<p>Definately. Never let a good crisis go to waste.</p>
<p>&rt;or do you think there is a certain goal in mind for them?</p>
<p>Who knows. All any of us can really do is speculate. </p>
<p>I'd say at the very least, bare minimum, they're covering for China's colossal fuck up.</p>

        <p>Your post contains no questions.</p>
<p>So... what exactly do you want to know? "Opinions on covid 19" is a pretty wide topic. It would require an essay.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will bite:</p>
<p>Cough19 is diseased cause by the Sars-CoV-2 virus that escaped (most likely accidentally though criminal intent cannot be excluded) from a virology lab (could be in Wuhan, could be somewhere else).</p>
<p>The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) used it to suppress the ever-expanding anti-CCP protests in Wuhan (July 2019) and Hong Kong. After noticing that the panic spreads., the CCP smelled an opportunity and engaged in a <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/china-covid-lockdown-propaganda">global lockdown propaganda</a> campaign.</p>
<p>Since the West is ruled mostly by stupid, our rulers didn't have the fine smell to distrust the CCP. It also didn't help that WHO's chief, Tedros Adhanom, is himself <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/who-and-china-dereliction-duty">a Marxist and a puppet of the CCP</a>.</p>
<p>From then on, it was a conjuration of interests. Big Pharma smelled an opportunity to make money, Bill Gates to expand his global health disruption operation (which had been on going for many years, as <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2018/11/28/global-health-disruptors-the-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation/">the British Medical Journal had explained in 2018</a>), politicians smelled an opportunity to expand their power (or advance other political goals), and son.</p>
<p>Soon enough significant portions of the planet found itself under "measures" that have very little to do with epidemiology and quite a lot to do with politics. It wasn't (and isn't) always a totalitarian interest per se. With some politicians it's just the interest of not looking "weak" and appear/pretend to "do something".</p>
<p>Most "conspiracy theories" circulated on the internet (many of them unfortunately on this sub as well) are the product of naivete, stupidity or of a much older condition known also as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAk3hsvv7bQ">the conspiracist mind</a>. However, <em>some</em> "theories" are planted intentionally by both State and private actors with various purposes: either to create chaos, or for crowd control (it's quite easy to identify which is which). You will also notice (if you look hard enough) a lot of conspicuous shilling (or doomerism if you want) and concern trolling against (or at) anyone suggesting legal action. That's part of crowd control. It's rarer on this sub (which is why I still stick around) but it happens.</p>
<p>Older people (who have seen panicard messaging in the past for swine flu, HIV, "war on terror", etc.) are and have been harder to convince.</p>
<p>Young people, on the other hand, have been easier to convince to adopt panicard nonsense (again - routinely not connected to the actual science and epidemiology of Sars-CoV-2).</p>
<p>The vaccine may or may not work (nobody really knows) - but the politicians really want it to work because the economic wreckage from the panicard policies is so terrible that it may sweep not just their careers, but themselves physically. As a result, politicians are now shilling as hard as they can for the vaccination programme. They also lie routinely and threaten with 'new normal' bs in the hope to convince as many hesitants as possible. Will that work? I don't know. I'm just enjoying the show.</p>
<p>The vaccine itself has side effects. The politicians' reluctance to openly discuss them has created <strong><em>more</em></strong> hesitants than they would've been if everyone had been honest from the getgo.</p>
<p>I probably would've taken the vaccine myself if not for this shitshow. But... since I had covid19 myself and turned out to be just a cough for me, and 11 months later my wife caught it and I didn't get reinfected - I will conclude for me personally that natural immunity is good enough for the time being.</p>
<p>I don't know... what else do you want to know?</p>

        <p>No new normal means exactly what it says to me. Iâ€™m ready to go back to regular life. This will get me downvoted here but Iâ€™ve already been vaccinated, yet Iâ€™m still wearing a mask because itâ€™s required. The vaccine is widely available and whoeverâ€™s gonna take it has taken it. I believe the pandemic has largely run its course and its time to let people return to normal. </p>
<p>I donâ€™t think of myself as some conspiracy theorist I just wonâ€™t accept that this is how we should live now.</p>
