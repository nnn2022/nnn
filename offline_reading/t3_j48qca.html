<title>“Govt Restrictions Are Unacceptable. We tried to communicate with govt but they didn’t listen. They’re imposing restrictions that’ll kill viable jobs &amp; damage mental health. I do not accept the government’s intended restrictions - they’re based on ignorance....” Andy Preston, Mayor of Middlesborough</title>

<p>In a video statement, Mr Preston said: “I have to tell you I think this measure has been introduced based on factual inaccuracies and a monstrous and frightening lack of communication, and ignorance.</p>
<p>“I do not accept the statement at all.</p>
<p>“I do not accept these measures.</p>
<p>“We need to talk to government, they need to understand our local knowledge, expertise and ability to get things done, and preserve jobs and well-being.</p>
<p>“We are really disappointed.</p>
<p>“As things stand we defy the Government and we do not accept these measures.</p>
<p>“We need to get Covid under control and we need to work with people to find a way of preserving jobs and mental health.”</p></p>

        <p>But guess what the BBC reported on ALL DAY?</p>
<p>"Trump HaS RonA aNd SeRves HiM RiGhT CauSe He SaID SiLLy ThiNgs."</p>
<p>Not even joking. ALL day they had talking heads thinking of different ways to tell us how Trump having rona means that you shouldn't vote for him. Oh wait I'm in Englad, I can't vote for him anyway, some days you almost forget. </p>
<p>Parliament just extended a bill giving the government powers to pass any law without a vote. Police can arrest aand detain anyone they want. MPs are finally fighting back after putting up with this stupidity for way too long and all our primary news channel that people actually pay for wants to tell you about is that Trump has a virus that is impossible to avoid and he doesn't even feel ill.</p>
<p>And people still look at me funny whe I try to tell them that the news is trying to distract you.</p>
<p>I give up. (I don't, I never will but oh boy this is tiring).</p>

<p>In a parallel yet inverse manner to the States, perhaps the resistance to tyranny will now start emerging from the U.K.‘s local authorities and mayors, rather than national political figures. After all, it is them that will have to answer to - and subsidise - their citizens for the rights violations, mass unemployment and mental health disasters.</p>

        <p>Andy backed down. Probably because he would be forced to resign if he did resist (or he has been bribed to not rebel).</p>
