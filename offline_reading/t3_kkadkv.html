    <strong>At what point did you stop following the rules, if you ever followed them at all? (RANT)</strong>
    <p><p>Being honest, when the country (UK) first went into lockdown in late March, I followed the rules for a while as we didn’t know what we were dealing with. Initially we were told we’d just be having a 2 week lockdown to ‘flatten the curve’ and now we’ve been in and out of lockdown ever since. By the end of April I was very skeptical but carried on following the rules (mainly because even if you break the rules there’s nothing to do, and friends etc wanted to follow them.) However, since the start of May when our first full scale lockdown was brought to an end, me and my friends haven’t really given a shit about the rules ever since. We have some nonsense ‘tier’ system that differs per region now, with tier 1 being the least restrictive and tier 4 being the most, but I’m not ashamed to admit I’ve been seeing friends, shaking hands, hugging etc as well as seeing my family today on Christmas Day with all of us not caring at all about any rules. What scares me though is the amount of people that follow them to the nth degree and still seem terrified of Covid, weirdly enough young people and people with no health conditions seem to think it’s some sort of deadly killer, and although how reputable it is is disputed, YouGov polling shows most people think the restrictions don’t go far enough. At the point where I don’t see an end to all this madness and can’t wait to just leave the country to go somewhere more normal. I went to Poland with a friend back in October and it was amazing to me how they were living their lives so normally (although it’s changed since then.) Nightclubs were open with no social distancing and no one cared about the rules. There was meant to be limited capacity but they were full, and they were meant to shut at midnight on our final night there but just stayed open with everyone partying hard, hugging, kissing etc. I just crave that normality back in my life. Sorry for the rant haha, but I truly am at a loss.</p></p>

        <p>June. The only thing I have changed about my behavior since then is wearing a mask indoors in public, and only if everyone else is. The few times I went to bars defying the rules or states without a mandate I never did. Admittedly I’m going out less but that’s because I’m between jobs, living on savings and have been kind of depressed. I had a wonderful Christmas with a small gathering (about 10 people so nothing huge but still really fun.) covid barely even got brought up once except in a roundabout way when my dad said he can’t wait for this year to be over.</p>

        <p>Never once followed the rules, apart from having to  pull a scarf over my face to get into my work building. This thing was clearly a NWO psyop from day 1. Got stopped entering the supermarket the other day for not wearing a mask. Told the guy I don't have one and carried on shopping and that was that.</p>

        <p>Probably around August. Once I saw the measures and realized that this is stupid. Even if I'm being forced to install one on my phone, but it's more a measure of screw it, I'll leave it for later.</p>

        <p>Never followed any rules, continued mixing with friends and family, traveled never wore masks unless inside a store that forces it</p>
<p>Sharing drinks, food, smoking hookah with friends since March </p>
<p>Haven’t gotten sick besides normal seasonal cough ect and everyone I know hasn’t either..... therefor the real risks of the virus are incredibly small and even if they were high I would rather take my chances then let someone else decide for me</p>
