    <strong>High school students performing some serious civil disobedience today.</strong>
    <p><p>I know most of you have a serious hate for teachers, but we are not all doomers, we just get overshadowed by the vocal Karens… anyway, today I witnessed my juniors and seniors perform some serious civil disobedience in a lockdown and restriction crazy area. They were outside dancing in the courtyard, running and chanting, dancing, having a great time. The school was running a type of class celebration that was supposed to be socially distanced outside throughout the school day. They were yelled at and scolded each time. A few came to me at the end of the day upset that they were being yelled at, saying it’s been a over a year of this and how tired of it they are, as well as the teenage ‘we deserve something’. Most of them are even vaccinated (I know) because their colleges are requiring it. I told them civil disobedience isn’t easy, but if it’s a cause worth fighting for you have to be willing to risk something. I was so worried about them falling into a normalization of masks and looking at people in fear, but I am not as worried anymore. These kids were from all different backgrounds, politics, beliefs, etc. I know this because I know many of them. Just made me happy.</p></p>

        <p>The radical left should be careful it doesn't push too far or a generation of willful and intelligent young adults with a nose for bullshit and a willingness to battle bullshitters will shut them down.</p>

        <p>I am in the US, but in one of the high restriction states. I worried about the mask thing too, because some are getting them to match outfits, with sayings, political statements etc. The peer pressure and adult pressure was extreme at the start of the school year, but seems to be waning. But it seems to me, they really felt like it was going to end by now and it’s not, and they are becoming frustrated with the not being able to work together… or just be together. Now they are acting like defiant and questioning teenagers, which is one of the reasons I have loved working with this age group for years.</p>

        <p>There's definitely something being incited.  The entire population has been deliberately placed under 14 months of unreasonable stress- lives and livelihoods disrupted.  The "expert leadership" handpicked to guide is through this crisis are purposefully trying to get people as terrified and panicked as possible.  Think about that.</p>
<p>Competent leaders know that keeping people calm is of prime importance in dealing with a crisis.  These fucks are doing the exact opposite.</p>

        <p>I am worried for the kids/teens because these 'measures' have wrecked havoc on their mental health.</p>
<p>However, I am not (and you should not be) concerned about them internalizing Cough19 propaganda. They sure won't! Not as a statistical norm, I mean.</p>
<p>This generation grew up on the Internet and on 4chan. There's no way you can fool them.</p>
<p>Besides, the lessons of history are consistent: it's always the young who eventually overturn the Regime.</p>
<p>From the kid who noticed that the emperor has no clothes and all the way to the late teens and tweens in Eastern Europe who took down Soviet-communism... it's always the same. Eventually the kids will say NO. </p>
<p>Our role as adults is to stand by them if they're right. And they're obviously right in this case.</p>

        <p>I'm confident that the children being raised in this madness will adamantly reject it when they grow up. Once they really figure to what extent they've been fucked, there's no way they'll take it.      </p>

        <p>Yet people are claiming that children have been irreparably damaged, terrified, scarred by the pandemic. It's just scaremongering. Children were sad when they couldn't see their friends. Some, sadly, were severely affected by abuse and neglect in families that couldn't support their emotional and physical wellbeing during lockdown, but the vast majority were fine, and are just happy to be back at school. There must be support for children with mental health issues whether related to the pandemic or not, but there should not be an assumption that children are all damaged.</p>
