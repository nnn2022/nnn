<p>Medical education and research were taken over by the Rockefeller Syndicate snake oil salesmen over 100 years ago. They teamed with the crooks in the AMA to build a protection racket for their corrupt Pharma cartel. </p>
<p>Long before vaccines and antibiotics, infectious diseases had mostly faded away due to sanitation, hygiene and nutrition improvements. This would’ve been bad for business, so they mostly swapped autoimmune diseases and cancers for the old infectious diseases, creating evergreen disease “treatment” franchises. SV40 contaminated vaccines helped with this endeavor. They injected hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>&rt;“While science greatly extended the original nontechnological advances in agriculture, hygiene, and birth control, the contribution of medical science to the overall reduction in death rates and improved health was relatively quite small. ^1:220-221</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>In the great majority of cases the toll of the major killing diseases of the nineteenth century declined dramatically before the discovery of medical cures and even immunization.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;"The <strong>chief credit</strong> for the conquest of the destructive epidemics ... ought to have been given <strong>to the social reformers</strong> who had campaigned for purer water, better sewage disposal and improved living standards. <strong>It had been their efforts, rather than the achievement of the medical scientists, which had been chiefly responsible for the reduction in mortality from infectious disease"</strong>. ^2:12

<p>Dr. Richard Horton is the editor in chief of the world’s leading medical journal, The Lancet.  Writing in his own journal he states that <strong>medical science has</strong> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">“taken a turn towards darkness.”</a></p>
<h2>Pharma: A History of Corruption</h2>
<p>&rt;”The Rockefeller Foundation pays the medical college pipers from the profits made by the Rockefeller Drug Trust and of course the Drug Trust calls the tune.” ^3</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The Rockefellers own the largest drug manufacturing combine in the world,</strong> and use all of their other interests to bring pressure to increase the sale of drugs.”</p>
<p><strong>SV40 Debacle</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”...98 million Americans alone probably were exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with SV40—a monkey virus that can cause cancers in animals.”</strong> ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”By 1960, scientists and vaccine manufacturers knew</strong> that monkey kidneys were sewers of simian viruses.“</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”As of 2003, SV40 had been found in human tumours in 18 developed countries.</strong> Bookchin and Schumacher claim that <strong>the rates of SV40-positive tumours seem highest in countries that used the greatest amount of contaminated Salk polio vaccine</strong>, including the UK, USA, and Italy.”</p>

<p>&rt;<strong>“MEDICAL EDUCATION AND THE ROCKEFELLERS</strong></p>
<p>&rt;The merchants-in-medicine, organized in the A.M.A., found allies in their fellow merchants in industry at the beginning of this century. <strong>It is peculiarly fitting that the agency that enabled them to monopolize the field of medicine and its education should be the General Education Board, an outgrowth of Doc William Rockefeller’s quack cancer cure and medicine show.”</strong> (5:93)</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Up to 90% of the total decline in the death rate of children between 1860-1965</strong> because of whooping cough, scarlet fever, diptheria, and measles <strong>occurred before the introduction of immunisations and antibiotics."</strong> ^6
&rt;<em>-Dr. Archie Kalokerinos, M.D.</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Much of what you have been led to believe about immunizations simply isn't true.”</strong> ^7</p>
<p>&rt;”If immunizations were responsible for the diminishing or disappearance of these diseases in the United States, <strong>one must ask why they disappeared simultaneously in Europe, where mass immunizations did not take place.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”With the polio vaccine we are witnessing a rerun of the medical reluctance to abandon the smallpox vaccination, which remained as the only source of smallpox-related deaths for three decades after the disease had disappeared.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”For thirty years kids died from smallpox vaccinations even though no longer threatened by the disease.”</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/obituaries/rene-dubos-scientist-and-writer-dead.html">“Rene Dubos, the microbiologist</a> formerly with the Rockefeller Institute, succinctly summed up the historical record. <strong>”The tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century,"</strong> Dubos wrote in Mirage of Health. "In reality," he observed, <strong>”the monstrous specter of infection had become but an enfeebled shadow of its former self by the time serums, vaccines, and drugs became available to combat microbes.</strong>” ^1:220</p>
<p>&rt;”Professor <strong>Dubos has further stated:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Modern Science’s role in defeating infectious diseases has been greatly exaggerated.</strong> Many of the most terrifying leprosy, plague, typhus, - had all but <strong>disappeared</strong> from Europe <strong>before serums, vaccines, and drugs</strong> were developed to combat them". ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“Many so-called "medical discoveries",</strong> however, have been <strong>announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever.  <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable purposes</strong> and have been <strong>exploited commercially</strong> and intensively.” ^8</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>"Harry Nelson, Medical Editor for L.A. Times, reported</strong> on an American Cancer Society Seminar for Science Writers, and announced that <strong>microbiologists have uncovered new findings that incriminate vaccination.</strong> One of the participants was <strong>Dr. Robert M. Simpson of Rutgers University, N.J.,</strong> who stressed that <strong>‘Immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body</strong> ...Some of these could be molecules in search of a disease, which under proper conditions become activated and <strong>cause a variety of diseases</strong> including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Parkinson’s disease <strong>and perhaps cancer."</strong> This quote is from the Honorof Report for June, 1976.” ^9</p>
<p>&rt;##“DOCTOR FORESEES A NATION OF INVALIDS</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Dr. S. S. Goldwater, New York Commissioner of Hospitals</strong> pointed out in The Modern Hospital Magazine that the <strong>present measures used</strong> to check contagious diseases <strong>may permit of longer life — but not of stronger life. As a result of the drugs, vaccines and other suppressive treatments</strong> used to check diseases, <strong>he says that, "chronic diseases are growing at such a rate</strong> that America may become a nation of invalids. <strong>Over half the hospital beds are filled with chronic sufferers, both old and young."</strong> (from Health Practitioner’s Journal, June, 1944)” ^10</p>
<p>&rt;”I read what prominent men of science, medical officers for health, and doctors wrote about vaccination and its sequelae that never made it into today’s textbooks, and found out what anyone with even a passing acquaintance with disease figures of the 19th and 20th century knew. For example, by the 1950s when the whooping cough vaccine was introduced, data showed that whooping cough was killing only 1 percent of the numbers of people who used to die in England and Wales 50 years before. ^11</p>
<p>&rt;Official data showed that the same happened with measles.”</p>
