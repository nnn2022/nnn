        <p>I've found the ones who were shouting the loudest about tolerance and acceptance before this shitshow started, are the ones who are the most vicious now.<br>
This applies to people I know online and in real life.  </p>
<p>It was never about tolerance, it was always about control. The ideology they followed before all this was already one which emphasised "don't think, Obey".</p>

        <p>Look up your state laws about religious or philosophical/moral exemptions. There are also federal laws that could help as well just have to do some research. All vaccines are derived/depend on aborted fetal tissue and stem cells in their research and development. If you are morally opposed to that then you would have to fill out an affidavit that states these things and logically outlines your legitimate beliefs. Get it notarized by an official notary public and sign it. Put your thumb print on it as well. Once it’s notarized, submit it into your local district court/clerk of court under “affidavits” or “miscallaneous.” It is now public record. Keep the original copy for yourself though. If/when your employment mandates you get the V, send the person who is requiring this (your manager, boss, etc) a letter of notice saying that they have 10 days to cease and desist their criminal activities that are injuring you. They prob will ignore it. After 10 days, you submit the affidavit explaining point for point how they are injuring you, how they are breaking the law, and you are holding them liable. They have to rebut your affidavit point for point and in good faith. </p>
<p>You can also go back into your old medical records from childhood if you have them. I was able to prove that i had severe reactions to vaccines throughout my childhood (my parents didnt know it was the shots that caused them so i kept getting them). So i got a doctor that wrote a letter to my college stating that i should not get any more vaccines (this was in regards to the flu shot) </p>

        <p>Good point. But what if your immune system is not compromised. Are there any blanket arguments that everyone could use? For example I was wondering if there was some religious ground for refusing. It would look very poor on a business to let an employee down based on religious beliefs.</p>

        <p>If you want a decent argument, I’d say the association-to-abortion one works pretty well.
So far every vaccine (at least where I live; Moderna and Pfizer mainly) available were either tested on or incubated in HEK 293 cells.</p>
<p>To clarify; during the testing trials to make sure the vaccines worked, both Moderna and Pfizer tested their respective vaccines on the HEK line.</p>
<p>The HEK line is a colony of stem cells that have been grown since 1960, and were sourced from an abortion performed at that time.</p>
<p>If you practice a religion, or follow an ethical group, which condemns abortion, this argument is wholly sound.</p>
<p>A notable exception includes the Latin (Roman Catholic) Church (of which I am NOT a part; I am Orthodox Christian), which, while condemning abortion, does not condemn the use of technologies dependent on abortion if the resulting use of those technologies saves lives in some way.</p>
<p>TLDR; the Covid vaccines were tested on stem cells sourced from an abortion; if your religion condemns abortion you should use that argument to get out of vaccination.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately due to the CDC stating there are NO contraindications, a medical exemption or any form of logic is unlikely to work against those employers. Many doctors are refusing to write exemptions for the Covid vax due to this fact, as they also don't want to be reprimanded.  </p>
<p>See here, the CDC is basically saying they want you to have a reaction to the first dose before they consider you can't get further doses. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#Contraindications">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#Contraindications</a></p>
<p>The best way is to do philosophical (rarely allowed) or religious exemption request. </p>

        <p>If that's their take on it then their diversity and inclusion is bullshit, it's meant to tick boxes and look good and not actually be diverse or inclusive in ways that matter. Requiring a gene therapy shot is not respectful of religion, because it's incompatible with some religions, and religious faith is more than an identity label; it's something that you follow every day in your life. And at least in the USA, some racial groups have a more negative history with forced medical treatments and forced medical experimentation than others.</p>
