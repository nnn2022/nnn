    <strong>Do any of you have valuable information on the Novavax vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>There is not much information on it yet, but for now I am considering it. It's technology is definitely the safest and it's easier on the immune system. I won't ever go near an mRNA shot. </p>
<p>I wanted to ask you guys if there is anything concerning about it. I would rather not take any shot, but this one doesn't seem too bad for now. IF there is nothing to worry about with this one I will probably get it. It better be damn good tho. </p>
<p>It also keeps getting delayed for some reason. Very few people talk about it. I wonder if the big boys feel threatened by it? It's supposed to be released in India first as far as I know.</p></p>

        <p>I have a naturally gained immunity from catching covid but novavax sounds better than MRNA that's for sure.  Still this shit needs more testing, glad they are not releasing it yet.</p>

        <p>I would almost like to catch it tbh, but the government doesn't consider natural immunity as a valid form of immunity. They want you to get vaccinated. At least here in Canada. I don't want to get a shot, but this Novavax has my attention. If it's very safe I will go for it.</p>

<p>Question - what mechanism of funding would you feel safe with?<br>
1. Government funding - obviously not because you object to warp speed funding</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Private charity funding? - You object to Bill Gates funding...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free market? Nope... Pfizer and the FDA bury adverse events to keep the $$$ rolling in.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I can tell, there's no way to fund a drug company that is <strong><em>not</em></strong> controversial. And yet it costs huge sums of money to run large scale clinical trials that may prove a drug ineffective. The larger the trial, the better the safety data, and the more it costs... So who is going to pay for it all?</p>

        <p>How about funding that isn’t shady as hell? </p>
<p>I’d be ok with government funding, but govt funding to create a vaccine in record time is shady. All while waiving any liability. </p>
<p>Private funding is good if it wasn’t from someone saying they wants to reduce the worlds population through vaccines. </p>
<p>Free market is good if the companies have liability for their product, and if it’s not being forced on people with said liability.</p>

<p>&rt;I’d be ok with government funding, but govt funding to create a vaccine in record time is shady.</p>
<p>In the context of a virus that's killed 600k, why is this shady? If anything, it would seem reckless to not have a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>&rt;All while waiving any liability.</p>
<p>How is this any different than the government picking up the malpractice insurance tab? Isn't injury covered under the vaccine injury compensation program? It's just another form of funding where the government is acting as the insurance company... And it's not as if the companies have 0 liability. They can still lose billions in R&amp;D if their vaccine is pulled from the market for safety concerns, and they can still be sued if they falsified data, etc. Not to mention damage to their brand image.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I think it's good to ask prudent questions around funding. For example, there has been a lot of back and forth around how the FDA is funded. Should it be entirely tax payer funded? Or funded in part by sales of the drugs it oversees?</p>
<p>But in the case of vaccines, it seems that questions around funding are often used as an excuse to not get vaccinated. As if funding manufacturing and large trials <strong><em>after the vaccine was developed</em></strong> (as in the case of Novavax) somehow affects it's safety profile irrespective of the large scale clinical trial data.</p>

        <p>The vaccine injury compensation is a joke. They rarely pay out and are known to leave people with serious issues stranded with medical bills. </p>
<p>These companies don’t stand to lose millions if you had even one eye open. The leaked Pfizer contract waived any liability for Pfizer, barred countries from suing Pfizer, and gave Pfizer complete control over how many doses they delivered. No matter what Pfizer decided to do, the countries had to shut the fuck up and pay. </p>
<p>Be a good little sheep and cheer on the big pharma companies that hate you. They’re a business that stands to make money off you without curing you, only relieving symptoms. Just like these sad excuses of “vaccines” do.</p>

        <p>Suing a company for compensation due to drug induced injury is also joke - it takes millions of dollars, many years, and your payout is pennies on the dollar. To me it seems that people citing vaccine liability as a reason to not get vaccinated are hypocrites unless they also shun every other drug on the market.</p>
<p>Right now several of my friends and acquaintances are hospitalized. Four people I know who are hospitalized are in their 30s and are unvaccinated. None of them are in serious condition, but there is high likelihood that they’ll have permanent lung scarring going forward among other long term symptoms.</p>
<p>My family members work on the front lines - they describe hospitals whose halls are lined with unvaccinated people waiting for room. And they’re almost exclusively unvaccinated. This wave, only a very small percentage of covid patients have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>So yes - I happily volunteered for the Novavax trial at the beginning of this year. I did it in part because Novavax is a different technology than mRNA or viral vector and I believe that people should have a plethora of options.</p>
<p>But it’s disheartening to hear you dismiss out of hand what I and 30,000 other Americans are doing to prove this vaccine is safe simply because they received government money. Money without which they would have gone bankrupt…</p>

        <p>Suing the companies individually is a lost cause, I know that. But class actions lawsuits are a whole different game, and I guarantee some good lawyers would step up and start a class action lawsuit for the half a million adverse effects that have been reported so far. </p>
<p>Even the threat of this could force a company to take a few extra steps to verify safety. And you still haven’t answered my point about the leaked Pfizer contract, which anyone with half a brain should realize is one-sided and parasitical. </p>
<p>But I would like to thank you for participating in the trial. I know many people are going to be happy to receive the vaccine you received, especially now that I hear many countries will be sharing it with other poorer nations. But One of these people will not be me.</p>

        <p>They have a reddit sub rNVAX.  A lot of the posts are about buying stock, but there are some about the vaccine.  It is the only one that my husband and I may consider.  It does work like old school vaccines.  They are in trials right now.  I'm afraid it won't be approved soon because  the government has invested so much money in the mRNA vaccines (which I won't consider).  Although Novavax is easier to store (can be refrigerated instead of frozen) and can be combined with the flu shot.  So that might help get it approved.</p>

        <p>Novavax is the only vaccine my husband and I will consider at this point.  It's a big NO to any mRNA vaccines, for various reasons.  Two things concern me about Novavax, however:  1). like the others, this vaccine uses spike protein, albeit in a different manner, and, 2) Bill and Melinda Gates are apparently on the board of Novavax's sister (or parent company...I forget which) company Covax.</p>
