    <strong>A relative of mine called the person who caught Covid a jerk for ruining it for everyone else</strong>
    <p><p>Because it just happened to be the promise that if we don't have anything for a month, they will open Singapore to Phase Three. And you know what, that just makes me sick. </p>
<p>Blaming somebody who just caught a disease that doesn't even effect the person in question. She has a 90 percent chance minimum of surviving Covid, heck I think she may have already caught it. She already coughed for a day or two, sometimes sick and nothing happened. </p>
<p>And then blaming the single person for getting something that most of us can easily survive. That just made my blood boil, to blame some scapegoat for something that would eventually happen to everyone. </p>
<p>Not the government who held all of these at the threat of making everyone comply with their insane measures for having a tracking device on their phone or an actual physical device that tracks who you come into contact with or the mask mandate. </p>
<p>She doesn't like wearing the mask, and for the most part blames those who get the illness than the government who overreacted. Our total deaths is 28 out of around 50,000. So your chance of dying is pretty close to zero. </p>
<p>And yet she blames other people for ruining it rather than those who held us at harsh penalities, shaming us in public to surrender our rights, to put on a mask, social distance and now wants to track our every movement.</p></p>
