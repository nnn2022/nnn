    <strong>Maskism and Vaxism = modern day Sexism and Racism</strong>
    <p><p>Humans have always had the natural tendency to discriminate against others for random reasons, such as skin color, sexual preference or gender. This was often supported at the time by "scientific" evidence from the leading scholars and universities of their time, which condoned people in their behavior.</p>
<p>In modern society that is no longer accepted, especially in recent years the MeToo and BLM have made sexism and racism very risky. But I would argue that there are now two new forms of wanton discrimination, that is maskism (discrimination for not wearing a mask) and vaxism (discrimination for not being vaccinated).</p>
<p>As before these forms of discrimination are based on inconclusive pseudo science (remember when Fauci said wearing masks was pointless, or when the WHO changed the definition of herd immunity?) and mass hysteria (cancelling a flight because a 2 year old isn't wearing a mask, having to wear a mask on an empty beach but not in a packed restaurant).</p></p>
