    <strong>Funny thing today at Smart &amp; Final, Southern California.</strong>
    <p><p>San Bernardino County, no mask mandate currently.  As I was checking out I asked the cashier about an item I couldn't find, as I was asking I spotted it on a shelf behind her.  No one in line behind me at that moment.  When I came back with the item a line had formed and I said to the cashier "I'll just get in line again, no big deal".  The nice young lady said 'no, I'll work you in' or something to that effect.  Anyway, she explains it to the next guy up, and he says something to the effect of "he's not wearing a mask, I'm not waiting"..... so she tended to him instead...... and while <em>that</em> was happening he suddenly decided to make a big production of staying as far away from me as possible, to the point of even going outside for a minute or two.  The funny thing is, the cashier he made the snide remark to <em>was</em> wearing a mask, but on her chin, and she does that all the time.  This guy with the snide remark seemed to have no problem with <em>that</em>, but indeed with me, I gotta guess because I wasn't playing by the 'rules'.</p></p>

        <p>Oh good grief. I wonder why he didn’t think “Maybe this person is fully vaccinated?” Super strange behavior on his part, especially because there isn’t a mask mandate? </p>
<p>Perhaps he may want to order his items online if he’s uncomfortable being out in public around others? Hhmm…</p>

        <p>I know.  He acted <em>so</em> afraid of "it", yet didn't choose curbside pickup somewhere.  I tried to make eye contact with him, to see if he had anything to say to me directly.  Nope on that I guess.  I felt like a plague rat even though I'm not sick.</p>
<p>I'm trying to keep a good humor up with all of this, but that was a punch to the gut.</p>
