        <p>&rt;"Something needs to be done"</p>
<p>You could try to let him get very specific and state exactly what they think should be done to people for how long and how intense, so the inherent violence isn't hidden behind some fuzzy "some degree of enforcement" but specific acts of aggression and violence.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, if they truly think people being out of their home are a danger to others, let them justify why those people in the open without any "proper reason" (according to him or the fascists) shouldn't be shot on sight or put in concentration camps. </p>
<p>After all they are a total danger to others, right? And it would likely "work" too, so why is he opposing these reasonable measures?^(/s)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then see what his reasons are for disagreeing with this (well if he doesn't disagree he is a complete fascist and absolutely lost) and then you could simply state that other draw the line somewhere else entirely, and why he thinks his initiation of aggressive force and violence were right and your peacefulness were allegedly wrong.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also - how convenient for the ruling class that "the personal responsibility approach" allegedly isn't "working", so some tyrants need to step in (that aren't of the same species of irresponsible humans apparently) and oppress everyone with threats of violence. Oppression of the masses is for some reason always the "solution" to these weird crises. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Interesting also that the ruling class is also the only source for those numbers that tell a story that they spin and directly benefit from and that you can't verify in any way for yourself. So they have obviously every incentive to lie. </p>
<p>Why does he naively believe that some parasitic crooks that will send armed thugs to cage him if he has green crumbles in his cigarette are not lying to him over this massive power grab?</p>

        <p>I believe this the manifestation of a deep seated requirement for most humans to have a belief in something.<br>
Other than the truly exceptional and gifted, people cannot grasp even a fraction of the true nature of the world. <br>
In the west, as the old faiths and religious have faded, it has left overactive imaginations trying to make sense of an increasingly complex world without the apparatus to do so. So now, instead of prohpets there are politicians who interpret the word of science, and the ley person just believes that they understand it.<br>
They are just as impervious to facts as a heliocentrist from the 1200's. Complete with absurd morality they believe to be inerrant and a set of rules which if broken, condemn the guity party.  </p>
<p>To question them is blasphemy.    </p>
<p>Same shit differnt millenium, and now instead of sacrificing people to the gods, we sacrifice the right to live life in the hopes of favour.  </p>
<p>I think perhaps a different approach than well reasoned discussion of the facts is needed to reach these people.  Hopefully they can be woken up from this before they do too much damage.</p>
