    <strong>Some reading material to keep everyone's mind off of those empty bank accounts, flailing businesses and being locked in the house like a five year old, courtesy of the John Hopkins University.</strong>
    <p><p>This article was pulled down but, nothing can ever be completely removed from the interweb.</p>
<p>Information and statistics from John Hopkins University were used for this. Its actually quite stunning. </p>
<p>Some highlights from the article, </p>
<p>"Surprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same."</p>
<p>“The reason we have a higher number of reported COVID-19 deaths among older individuals than younger individuals is simply because every day in the U.S. older individuals die in higher numbers than younger individuals,” Briand said.</p>
<p>"These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people’s assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States."</p>
<p>"Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the COVID-19 death toll is misleading."</p>
<p>"Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19."</p>
<p>“All of this points to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths. Total death numbers are not above normal death numbers. We found no evidence to the contrary,” Briand concluded.</p>
<p>REMEMBER, THIS IS FROM THE JOHN HOPKINS NEWLETTER. SO, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR SHIT FROM ANY COVID VIRUS ENTHUSIASTS. THIS WAS WRITTEN BY ONE OF YOUR LEADERS OVER AT THE COVID TEMPLE OF TERRIFYING STATISTICS</p>

        <p>Ya i've run the stats and concluded the same. </p>
<p>A couple notables that I also dug up:</p>
<p>They lowered the bar for excess death threshold in 2020 compared to 2019 (creating a visual illusion) despite the fact that it was also projected, pre-2020, that the death rates will increase dramatically over the next few years..starting with 2020. Additionally the life expectancy has consistently dipping over the past several years mostly as a result of younger people dying. Finally, in the first 3 months of 2020, when most excess deaths typically occur, there was an unusual sag reporting many fewer deaths, therefore this gap could be applied  at a later date creating another illusion of a mass excess death scenario. </p>
<p>I did run the numbers and it appears that 2020 could reach a death toll of over 3 million, however, statistically this death rate would be no different than any other Bad Flu season becasue you have to factor in population growth (why death rates can be more transparent than death tolls)..A great majority of "excess" deaths in other age groups are not attributed to COVID at all, suggesting that  younger people are in fact dying at an accelerated pace as being highly noted pre 2020. </p>
<p>Every time I confront people with the real data, they become excruciatingly defensive and hostile resorting to only irrational derogatory remarks,  which clearly indicates that we do have a psychological pandemic abroad.</p>

<p>Somehow, while dealing with this insanely deadly pandemic, the average life expectancy in the US has actually risen by 0.08%, the same increase as between 2018 and 2019, and better than the 0.03% increase between the two years before those.</p>
<p>So really, how much death ARE we spreading?</p>

        <p>Lol true,</p>
<p>Just a minor correction though which does not undermine your valid point. They are not saying the average life expectancy has increased with COVID lol...albeit an ironically funny stat. They are saying that those dying from COVID are those people who have already exceeded the average life expectancy.. And of course in this age group many of these people are suffering from a multitude of terminal conditions, beyond age itself.</p>
<p>Ya The only real death that is spreading is the death that is resulting from all their measures. SO many people in the US are so self absorbed but also attempt to claim how the care, but they forsake these massive death counts that are happening not only in the present but will in the future, both in the US , but especially abroad where already poverty stricken countries are going to suffer deaths of a genocidal magnitude. </p>
<p>But i guess sacrifices have to be made so they can pretend to be safe...just sick...</p>
