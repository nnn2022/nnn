    <strong>If we could get the actual, legitimate death count for Covid, how do you think it would compare to H1N1?</strong>
    <p><p>I know my father-in-law had H1N1 in 2009 and said it was the worst illness he’s ever had (and he had Covid last month). And today, when I brought it up, my dad told me about a friend of his who had it and was put into a temporary coma to recover. Didn’t shut down the world for that, though.
What do you suppose the <em>actual</em> mortality rate and death count is for Covid compared to H1N1?</p></p>

        <p>No idea but I had both, both as a young healthy teen/adult, and H1N1 was absolutely awful, I ended up in the hospital and was messed up for a while. Covid was nothing more than a minor cold, didn’t phase me at all.</p>

        <p>Same here! Almost died from H1N1, same experience as you with covid. Not confirmed covid but couldn't taste shit for a week and had a gnarly cough for that long. Was back in February. Got over it no problem.</p>

        <p>I had H1N1 at 21 years old and it put me in bed for two weeks feeling completely miserable; I got covid 5 months ago (at 32 years old, and fatter) and apart from the shittyness of not being able to taste food for a week and a couple days of fatigue I was feeling good one week later and totally symptoms-free by 10 days after symptoms started, it was actually milder than the colds I usually get (milder than a cold I had a month ago).</p>

        <p>I had H1N1 in early 2019. The urgent care doctor didn’t even flinch. No mask, nothing. I was the sickest I’d ever been, and I was only 31. I’m a pretty healthy, average weight woman who never gets sick. I was bedridden for 2 weeks. That’s one of the reasons I think (no I know) this COVID crap is bull. I’m living life as normally as possible with zero fear. Did it suck getting H1N1? Yep. Did dying ever cross my mind? Nope. Wasn’t even on my radar. My kids all came into my room to hug me goodnight, just no kisses lol.</p>

        <p>I’m almost positive I had Covid in late 2019, and it was a similar experience for me. Yeah, it sucked, sickest I’ve ever been, but dying never crossed my mind (except in a melodramatic fashion when my husband asked how I felt), and my doctor had no problem coming right up to me while I was coughing up a lung to check me over.
I don’t think most people prior to all this bullshit would’ve ever thought of dying when they contracted this particular flu. They would’ve just ridden it out with no problems.</p>

        <p>I was hospitalized for H1N1 in 2009. Just had cOvId 3 weeks ago, the only symptoms I had were a stuffy nose and a little fatigue. No hospitalization but of course I had to stay inside and away from civilization for a month. That is worse than the hospital.</p>

        <p>I have no idea what illnesses I catch yearly because I never get tested. I stay home and sleep (and sweat) it off. Some are worse then others, like when every joint aches and my skin is sensitive. One got me so bad that I was out of breath for weeks. Never went to the doctor. I never even need antibiotics for anything. Neither does my kid. </p>
<p>I remember the news made a huge fuss about H1N1, but that's all it was. A fuss on the news. And they've been screaming about new illnesses that will decimate us every year since. No one ever locked us up or shut us down for those. I remember one time there was an Ebola outbreak in Africa and the first thing the US did was bring an infected doctor back to the states for treatment. I found that insane.</p>

        <p>I got sick during that outbreak at (unconfirmed) and I blacked out with a fever. So it was one of the scariest illnesses I’ve had short of meningitis when I was 4. If I’ve had covid at all this year or last (haven’t been sick in years thanks to a healthy diet and exercise) I haven’t noticed so much as a sniffle 🤷🏽‍♀️. </p>

        <p>Much much less.  I’m amazed at the people who show up at the hospital with mild symptoms too.  I’ve been nailed by MANY horrible flus, including the 2009 H1N1 that took me probably a month to regain my health from.  I’m sure I had covid in April this year due to all symptoms lining up....and it was absolutely minor compared to flu.  I now know MANY in their 70s and 80s who had the covid cold....that was basically a mild to more cold.  Not a horrible flu.</p>

        <p>In all fairness we will never have actual legitimate death count for Covid. The records simply aren't being kept, despite the emphasis on stats.  But that's OK, we don't have actual, legitimate death counts for H1N1.  </p>
<p>If we learn anything from all of this, it's that epidemiologists, public health officials, and medical professionals in general use a lot of data that is what we call anally extracted.  Which is to say they just pull it out of their ass.  You can dress it with confidence intervals, error bars, and P &lt;= .05 all you want,  but Dr John P. A. Ioannidis pretty much proved this in 2005 with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248">his seminal paper.</a></p>
