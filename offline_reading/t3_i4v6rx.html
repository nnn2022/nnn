        <p>To be fair, why would a corporation take the risk to fast track a vaccine only to be sued for it later? </p>
<p>They usually take 5+ years to develop and test, but here they are being asked to do that in 1 year.</p>

        <p>This is fair, but I don’t object to that as much as the likelihood of this thing being mandatory. I never thought I’d be siding with the anti-vaxxers on anything</p>

        <p>It isn't a fair position at all. We're talking about injecting substances directly into the bloodstream of 7+ billion people for profit and not holding the corporations accountable who are rushing it through while not incentivized in any form to prioritize safety. That's not reasonable.</p>
<p>Despite whatever the industry propaganda might have us believe, all vaccines entail <em>some</em> level of fallout / risk, there's no such thing as a vaccine with perfect efficacy and perfect safety.</p>
<p>Not only all of that, but this new "mRNA" technology has never successfully been implemented before for vaccination, has had alarming results with severe side effects in high proportions of healthy individuals during initial testing. Now they are talking about making them mandatory for everyone, for a virus that is not a danger to the overwhelming majority of the population, and is on its way out naturally.</p>
<p>That should be cause for concern to anyone.</p>

        <p>Eh... </p>
<p>We literally won't have the capacity for 7 billion doses this year, or next.  You have to first develop the vaccine, then source the materials for dosing, then make the doses, then deliver and administer.  I believe that even the aggressive contracts from the government are for a guaranteed 100 million doses by the end of the year, with the potential for up to an additional 500 million next year and beyond.   And this is if they start making doses now, while the vaccines are still being tested--so basically in about 5-ish months.  Even at an optimistic rate of 500 million doses a year in 2021 forward, that will take YEARS for the planet to be vaccinated--and that isn't even accounting for the potential of only partial and/or temporary immunity (like the flu vaccine).  </p>
<p>I also don't believe--irrespective of the fear mongering--that required vaccination will be a thing.  Why?  Because it isn't a thing already for far far far more deadly diseases like measles, smallpox, etc.   Even in cases where you voluntarily enter an agreement (like with a private institution) where they require vaccines, there is a  religious exemption option in all cases.</p>

        <p>i want you to be right. i hope you are.</p>
<p>just want to point out that in a way, we do already have mandatory vaccination in the form of them being required in order to attend school. given how the world has reacted to this so far, it seems likely there will be a push to make covid vaccine one of those required inoculations - unless people come to their senses and treat it more like how the flu vaccine is currently handled. that would make a lot more sense.</p>

        <p>They ask for it, but that religious exemption exists even in elementary school.  My kid's school posts stats of how many unvaccinated and 'exempt' (i.e. due to religious reasons) kids there are (as a percentage), and I live in a state that loves authoritarianism.   It's that pesky constitution (as they might say). </p>
<p>Also, I don't have a lot of faith in the potential for widespread vaccine adoption--for one, I doubt the efficacy, and for two, I think we'll have viable therapeutics (and more of them) well before the vaccine is viable.  What our government is doing is hedging bets right now.  The only way to back the winning horse when you can't lose and have deep pockets is to back every horse.</p>

        <p>This is nothing new in the US. I’m not sure about other countries. But since the 80s the vaccine companies have not be liable for injuries relating to vaccination. If you are vaccine injured in the US you have to prove to a government run vaccine court that the injury is from the vaccine and then you are paid damages from a tax payer funded fund. This has been an argument made by many “anti-vaxxers” for years now. Most anti vaxxers I know are less anti vaccine and more pro safer vaccine and it’s hard to not see their argument that without liability the vaccine companies may overlook some negative trial data to get another vaccine money maker on the market. </p>
<p>What I think is coming to light is a lot of people that never would have questioned getting a vaccine are aware to the thought that maybe a vaccine producer without liability might not be the safest best for the population as a whole.</p>
