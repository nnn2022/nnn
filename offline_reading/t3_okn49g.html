    <strong>I can’t keep doing this anymore.</strong>
    <p><p>There are 10 active cases in Victoria, Australia and there are 6.681 million people living here as of September 2020. That mean that not 0.0001% of the state has COVID, and the chances of any of those people dying from it is so low that I won’t even bother to calculate it. The government is no threatening to lock us down again, they say it’s gonna be a snap lockdown but we all know it won’t be. I’v had to cancel catching up with my friends for the seventh time because of this, I haven’t seen them in 3 months. I had a panic attack when I heard the news today, my mental health has been deteriorating because of this and nobody seems to care, all that matters is COVID and nothing else. I’m so tired, I can’t keep doing this, every week I tell myself that it will be over soon, that I’ll see my friends on the weekend, that everything will be great and then they take it away from me. Again and again, for months on end, it’s been a year and a half and there’s no end in sight. I’m sick of all these selfish people telling me to wear a mask, get jabbed (I have a severe needle phobia), to stay inside, to give up all social interactions and live indoors forever, it’s all so tiring and I can’t do it anymore. To whoever reads this, for the love of god save us. Australia is a hellhole, we lock down over cases fewer than <em>fucking</em> 15 in a county of 6.6 million people. We legally have to sign in to a government app every single time we enter a shop or building, just so they know where we are. Make it stop, I want to be happy and see my friends again.</p></p>

        <p>i saw a documentary the other day about the alt-right vs antifa in 2018. what was amazing is that both groups pretty much said the same thing, just which "side" they were on was different.</p>
<p>It's exactly this kind of division that allows govts to divide us even though, at its heart, we just want the same things. Perhaps if "we, the people" were able to focus our difference on govt and hold them to account collectively, things would be a lot better.</p>

        <p>It's good to hear people their voicing their anger and frustration.  We were constantly fed the line that Australia is normal, Australians are on board with this, be like Australia.  But it's become clear over the last several months that this is far from the truth and it's good to hear it from actual people on social media.  I'm in Canada.  I have an uncle in Mackay, Queensland.  I still see him sharing stupid shit on fb making light of the lockdowns.  I feel like messaging him and asking if he thinks it's getting a little ridiculous now.  But it would probably cause family issues and stress him.</p>

        <p>It's politics. These moron politicians simply want to look back after this is all said and done (if that can even happen now) and point at the number of cases that occurred under their watch. The COVID count is the SINGLE metric by which they will measure their own performance. </p>
<p>Closed businesses? Who cares? </p>
<p>Lost jobs? Don't give a shit! </p>
<p>Mental health issues? What's that?</p>
<p>Domestic violence? Never heard of it!</p>
<p>Old people spending their last years without sparing family contact? Doesn't matter. </p>
<p>And then for businesses that are still somehow around, getting stock through closed borders? Doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Rising costs due to inflation caused by all of the above? Not my problem.</p>
<p>Then top it off where I am reading an article today where 90% of the people / staff have been fully vaccinated and one worker tests positive and they are straight into clown show mode. This seems to be a portent into the future; vaccination numbers don't appear to matter.</p>
<p>In short, I don't see a way out of this BS at this point to be honest. We are too far gone down a rabbit hole where priorities are back asswards, down is up and logic no longer exists.</p>
<p>Sorry I couldn't be more positive mate, but sometimes just airing frustrations can help a bit.</p>

<p>Take all you have left and pile them up.</p>
<p>They will not stop until they have extinguished every bit of hope from us.</p>
<p>which is the goal of reopening and then clamping back down every nation has a variation of this tactic. The goal of reopening is to give you just enough hope to not form any opposition.  whats next is the concentration camps where people will easily sell out their neighbor for some freedom</p>

        <p>It's all a psy op. the virus was never isolated. Mind you, it <em>was,</em> allegedly, but if you read into what exactly they do which they call 'isolate', it becomes clear that the virus was created for the sheer purpose of making the vaccine and then divide us a la WW2 with this despicable kind of rhetoric.</p>
<p>The way they <em>isolated</em> the virus is by picking samples of snot and spit from symptomatic people, putting it into a centrifuge, basically a fancy blender, then pick proteins at random, break them up and run them through PCR programs on computers to generate visual representation of the 'isolated virus'.</p>
<p>This would be equivalent to looking for a wolf in the woods, and in order to find it you take a bunch of terrain, trees, deer and bugs, put it all in a blender and call it a wolf.</p>
<p>To prove it as causation of disease additionally, they test it on human skin cells in a petri dish to show how, supposedly, the virus causes the cells to deteriorate. What they don't mention is that, prior to adding the virus, the tissue is starved and poisoned. Always. Otherwise it doesn't work!</p>
<p>German researchers took human cells, starved them and poisoned them, without adding any virus, and found that their microscope photos were identical to those of cells supposedly dying <strong>because</strong> the virus was added. It's BS.</p>
<p><strong>The variants are simply different algorithms in the PCR programs. They are made out of thin air to keep us scared and to further the hate rhetoric that will eventually lead to genocide or civil war.</strong></p>
<p>Soon they will probably claim that the "anti-vaxxers" or the anti-gene therapy-people are at fault of the abiding citizens not getting their lives back. The antivaxxers will be to blame for the economy, the deaths of 80+ yr olds with comorbidities, etc. to the point where they are dehumanized.</p>

        <p>That sounds nuts, Im sorry they are so crazy there.  But it will help to remember that those crazy things, like the cell phone checking in you mentioned, are just offers from some corporation that require your consent and you do not have to accept or accept without condition (eg, "i'll accept your offer to take your drugs on the condition you sign here accepting all liability for it").  </p>
<p>As youre in Australia, you should check out solutionsempowerment.com and others like tom barnett for helpful info on how to deal with these offers.  </p>
<p>Also, remember to zoom out and see if u cant find solutions to the problems they are trying to create.  For example, what if you didnt have a phone?       They make a lot of errant presumptions, like that everyone has a phone, that you can simply and briefly set straight (eg, "oh i dont do phones...i'd never get anything done if i had one and that RF radiation is really horrible for health...thanks for the offer though!") and continue moving on.</p>

        <p>I must admit, it’s probably the only thing I like about South Africa! The government and police are so useless that you can pretty much break all the rules and the chances of getting caught are practically non existent. We bootleg alcohol even though it’s banned. Stay out past our 9pm curfew despite it being punishable by arrest. Spend time with family and friends at socials despite it being banned and “enforced”. </p>
