    <strong>Sob story time!</strong>
    <p><p>Alright, so I‚Äôm 13. A bit of info for you.</p>
<p>Quarantine is stupid. But, the normal of before was also stupid. I‚Äôm not saying I want everyone t wear 500,000 masks in 100,000 hazmat suits at once, everyone would die from that. And I don‚Äôt want everyone to die. Good people are out there, but they‚Äôre getting harder to find. But there‚Äôs gotta be someone good out there.</p>
<p>Anyways, before quarantine, I went to school physically. But school physically was not fun. Kids yelling at teachers. Near-constant bullying and physical fighting. And say anything to the principal, now you gotta screw your head backwards so no one ‚Äújumps‚Äù you (when a group of people tackle you and beat you to the ground.)
Online school is slightly more relaxing as I don‚Äôt have to hear about Fight #8282992821911 and get worried it could happen to me (has a few times), but it has dropped my mental health to a new low. I don‚Äôt have the energy to move 99.99% of the time. I only force myself to for my family. It‚Äôs just the same thing. Go on computer, scroll, get shit grades anyways. Go to play on smaller screen. (I enjoy doing that, I‚Äôve got some games I really like but still.)
I‚Äôve been getting the thoughts. Of death. I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Both normals were bad to me. I can‚Äôt just transfer schools. That‚Äôd be too costly to my parents, and my parents already have enough shit to do.
The first normal where I went everywhere physically, well not really everywhere, I only went to school and home. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go anywhere else.
The second normal (now) where people have to wear masks in schools and stores, it‚Äôs the same to me. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on physically now. But I‚Äôm pretty sure kids are still shouting at the teachers.
I hear many people here saying ‚Äúoh, live life!‚Äù But...what is life? Is life just an endless cycle? Even before, it was school to home, school was shit, home was slightly better shit. Life to people is doing things. Lots of things. But I can‚Äôt do those things.
Now, life is just home now.
Is life just.....like this? Just a set of cycles we all think as normal?
Why?
Why do I have to be immature to have a childhood? Isnt me being young childhood? What is childhood to you all?
I‚Äôm not a pro-masker. I‚Äôm not gonna wear the thing for 8 fucking hours. But even without the thing on my face, school is still shit, and nothing could change that. How to live life and the concept of it is bullshit. Life is shit either way, right? So....what would change besides no more mask-wearing in schools and stores? It would be the same thing again.
People were stressed. People are still stressed now. Government is shit. Government will always be shit. What‚Äôs the point of..trying to change it?
I don‚Äôt know anymore</p></p>

        <p>I'm also around your age, and I like your POV. I actually liked quarantine; but now I'm having to go back to school and wear a mask 8 hours a day. I am an all or nothing kind of person. Complete quarantine or completely maskless.
Just remember, scarlet fever, Spanish flu, polio, they were all widespread. But we're not wearing masks for the Spanish flu, right? 
And the other thing that makes this pandemic different is social media. That's what makes this seem bigger than it actually is. This will end, just as every other disease didn't last forever.</p>

        <p>Mhm.  Everything stops. This is no different. Eventually, people will stop wearing masks. The media will find another thing to freak out over. Life will go back to normal. Whatever normal was</p>

        <p>I was just really disheartened when I read articles about this being a "forever pandemic" and decided to do my own research. I found this subreddit and more or less had an epiphany about all of this. (And when vocalizing the information that said this was wrong, I was told to 'check my resources' because the person I was speaking to just didn't want to believe what I had read.)
This really is over inflated because of media, just as everything else was before.
Your post inspired me because I feel like we're in the same boat. I live in a really liberal city, and so I only hear about thinking we'll be wearing masks for YEARS and that stupid people don't wear masks. If people want to wear them, they can. But if you don't want to, that should be okay too! I honestly hate it the most at school. My class goes on walks outside and still have to wear a mask and distance. Even though we're outside.
I'm currently being robbed of my highschool experience and I want things to be normal. 
It feels good knowing there's light at the end of the tunnel, even though the date of that has been undetermined.
Texas's numbers are fine, covid wings are closing, and there's no news of another lockdown. 
I'm commenting with you because I want to share my optimism with someone who is around my age and feels more or less the same way. All of my friends are more of the mask-stay-home-and-don't-see-anyone sort of views so I apologize for approaching you with my point of view. üòÖ
Remember when they said, "We'll only be home for 2 weeks!"</p>

<p>You are not helpless. The government is shit. So what do you do? You get involved. You make your spot in the political landscape. You make a change. Dont wait for someone else to do it. You can make an inpact. Good thoughts sent to you!</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt care if people wear shit on their faces. Good for you. I don‚Äôt like em but each to their own.
But even with the mask, people are still asses. (Some people are good though. Hopefully.) it‚Äôs just become more muffled.
Is life just being an asshole and dealing with other assholes and sometimes liking them? I barely like any of them. I was the nerd in physical school. Show-off. Snitch. That got me into fights I‚Äôd get suspended for, then I‚Äôd get shunned and yelled at by my family, then cycle starts all over again. Yayyyy....:/</p>

        <p>&rt; Is life just being an asshole and dealing with other assholes and sometimes liking them?</p>
<p>Yes üòÇ Emphatically, yes.</p>
<p>Have you ever read Ecclesiastes? Here are some quotes from the first chapter:</p>
<p>&rt; Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes: vanity of vanities, and all is vanity. ... All things are hard: man cannot explain them by word. The eye is not filled with seeing, neither is the ear filled with hearing. ...What is it that hath been? the same thing that shall be. What is it that hath been done? the same that shall be done. ...I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold all is vanity, and vexation of spirit. ...The perverse are hard to be corrected, and the number of fools is infinite.</p>
<p>I think you would really vibe on this right now.</p>
<p>Everything in this world is transient, but the unconditional love of our Creator, or the Universe, or however you think of it. The love you have for other people, and learning the rules of how to be the most loving, humble, brave, enduring, best person you can be, through trial and error.  This sincerity of purpose in the pursuit of truth and beauty, is the only thing we take beyond the grave.  So it is a good thing to hate the world‚Äôs things and all the bad things people do out of greed for these things, including yourself.  It means you are focusing on the eternal and only Good.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

I'm glad you're kinda doing ok, just because people are adults don't think they understand what they are doing, self awareness is rare as my dad says.</p>
