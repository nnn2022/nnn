        <p>Christianity is basically a dead religion. I know I'm going to get howls of protest for saying that and am also a massive hypocrite, but, seriously, when was the last time any of us saw someone who followed <em>half</em> of what is said in the gospels? A quarter? A tenth?</p>
<p>American Christianity is so hopelessly tainted by partisan politics that literally quoting Jesus can get someone called a commie / fascist / Nazi or whatever the buzzword is this week. It doesn't matter, because aside from Catholic hospitals and the huge pile of money the Mormons are sitting on there's nothing in it worth fighting for: it bows to prevailing winds, justifies every economic ill, and fawns over power and injustice. How is the prince of darkness even supposed to know we're there? What are we doing? Where is our personal commitment to what we preach?</p>
<p>There are millions of people using the name of Christianity to enforce a 1950s cultural LARP in the vain belief it will protect them from ghost stories. There are very few Christians.</p>

        <p>I just commented about something similar somewhere else.  I'm half Jew and half catholic, but still observe many of the pagan traditions my ancestors did back when they were in Russia and in a viking settlement.  </p>
<p>I like the new testament as the teachings of the Nazarene prophet Yshua Bar Yossef.  Yshua was quite skilled at laying ethical foundations for the 613 commandments and was unafraid to call out corruption even if it killed him, a very jewish thing to do.</p>
<p>Yet for some reason, a group of non jews heard the teachings of a jewish mystic of the Essene sect, removed him contextually from his religion, and created a watered down version of Judaism, but with an afterlife.  </p>
<p>Catholicism has some wonderful symbolism and is complimentary to the Talmud in many ways, and I like it as it seems to marry the Hebrew teachings with the pagan sentiments my ancestors had, but the  separation of Yshua from the Essenes and subsequent deification I do not understand, despite the resurrection.</p>

        <p>I don't know why you're getting downvoted except that truth hurts.. Christianity is constantly bending the knee on all kinds of progressive stuff that if you read the Bible says the opposite, then go on to say "well this is the spirit of it. It's what jesus would do.." despite it directly contradicting long-held doctrine.</p>

        <p>I agree with all of what you say except you should replace "Christianity" with "Powerful Christian Leaders." Especially in the Catholic Church this is the case. It doesn't mean Catholicism is defunct though, there have always been bad leaders in it's history and world history.</p>

        <p>I mean with some of the changes I could blame that on the leadership but particularly with Catholicism, got to say y'all need to as a whole figure out your whole pedophilia thing. Way too complacent when it's been made clear that the corruption that allows it goes all the way up through the Vatican for many popes now.  At some point you have to hold the members of a organization responsible for the actions of its leadership for not rejecting the leadership or leaving.</p>

        <p>I grew up in a very Catholic community and there are people who practice what they preach and have largely devoted their lives to the greater good, whether that be helping people with disabilities, the homeless, etc, while also being Christian. Catholic Charities is also one of the biggest charities in America that helps tens of thousands of people.</p>

        <p>I reject the greater good as a tenet of Catholicism, despite the false idol that is pope francis.  God is clearly a libertarian</p>
