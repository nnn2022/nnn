    <strong>The MSM-driven Trump hysteria was psychological conditioning for Covid hysteria then vaccine hysteria.</strong>
    <p><p>Think about it.  Starting probably 2012, but more pronounced starting 2014, it was difficult to have political discussions with people on the other side of the spectrum without it getting heated.  It became just about impossible, however, to have the same conversation starting in 2016, and it has continued to deteriorate to this day.</p>
<p>People, particularly on the left but I'm not exempting the right, have been mentally conditioned to a set of MSM-driven talking points.  They MUST cling to these talking points or else they have no identity.  The constant panic and fear they pushed in the Trump Era was easy to extrapolate to covid.</p>
<p>Just a few examples of the psychological conditioning:</p>
<hr>
<p>MSM:  "the election was stolen by the Russians"
People:  "we are living in an illegitimate dictatorship and the Russians hacked the election!"</p>
<p>Vs </p>
<p>MSM:  "if you question the election then you are a terrorist"
People: "How dare you question the legitimacy of the election?! Elections are so perfectly safe with no fraud ever!!"</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>MSM:  "Kavanaugh rapist, believe all women"
People:  "holy crap Kavanaugh is a rapist and I believe all women!"</p>
<p>Vs </p>
<p>MSM:  "Only believe some women, Biden and Cuomo are good."
People:  "oh my God how dare you accuse Biden or Cuomo of anything indecent!! Some women just shouldn't be believed!"</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>MSM:  "Trump may not say racist things but he is racist, anyone who supports Trump is racist"
People:  "how can you be such a racist, awful Trump supporter,  you racist?"</p>
<p>Vs</p>
<p>MSM:  "Racist things Biden repeatedly says are not racist"
People: "LOL he's just a silly loveable guy and totally not racist"</p>
<hr>
<p>I'll stop there, but i could do this all day.  The point is that they tell you lies and push an agenda over and over again, then they have an army of NPCs enforce that message.  </p>
<p>So, Covid comes around, and the people's brains are now completely melted, so they reap the rewards, knowing that people will believe literally anything they say:</p>
<p>MSM:  "it came from a bat or pangolin or something "
People:  "it's so totally natural origin anyone who says otherwise is racist!"</p>
<p>MSM:  "lockdowns are good"
People:  "stay in your freaking house you selfish evil Trump supporter!"</p>
<p>MSM: "lockdown protests are superspreader events"
People: "why would you do this?? Are you trying to kill my grandma??  Just lock down you selfish bastard!"</p>
<p>MSM: "BLM protests are righteous, and do not spread the virus"
People:  "Holy crap don't you believe that Black Lives Matter???  Support the protests!!"</p>
<p>MSM: "the virus spreads in small businesses but not Walmart "
People: "Only shop at Walmart and Amazon!!!"</p>
<p>MSM:  "the vaccine is good, rigorous testing doesn't matter"
People: "this is the best vaccine ever!!!"</p>
<p>MSM:  "vaccine side effects aren't real"
People: "that means it's working!!!"</p>
<p>MSM:  "you are a good person if you get the vaccine"
People:  "I'm such a great person, look at me! Look at my vax card!  I care about everyone!"</p>
<p>MSM: "if you don't get the vaccine, you are a bad person"
People:  "don't you care about other people, you trump-supporting uneducated racist??"</p>
<p>MSM: "People should be forced to get the vaccine"</p>
<p>---&rt; we are here &lt;---</p>
<p>Scared yet?  I am.  I don't claim know what's next, but I do know it's going to get worse.  Buckle up.</p></p>

        <p>The 'hysteria' about Trump wasn't hysteria. The man is a known homophobe, transphobe, misogynist... I could keep on going here.</p>
<p>Trump even has some pretty credible allegations of sexual assault and at the least statutory rape against him.</p>
<p>As to Kavanaugh... I didn't like him because he cannot seem to get it through his head that the government should not be making anyone into second-class citizens nor dictating to people what they do with their own bodies (i.e. abortion, getting or not getting one).</p>
<p>I never bought the whole 30 year ATF allegations against him and I was one of the first to say "Allegations not credible!" from my mother, who was a victim of sexual assault, telling me that is way too damned long to wait to make allegations of something like that.</p>

        <p>You're missing the point, which is the juxtaposition emphasizing the lie, forming a pattern of cognitive dissonance as part of psychological conditioning.</p>
