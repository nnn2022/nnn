    <strong>Masks are actually the reason cases keep rising</strong>
    <p><p>Ok so I was thinking about how people that mask up seem to basically be in love with it. They have masks so high up on a pedestal that in their mind it's an invulnerable shield and therefore we anti maskers not having one means we want people to die.</p>
<p>So based on their thinking that masks are infallible, they disregard all other hygiene methods that I'd bet most of us did and have always done and these things are infinitely more effective that a piece of cloth. Without going into complete detail as I'm sure you all know what I mean but things like washing hands after being out in public especially before touching eyes, face, having food etc etc. Coughing or sneezing into your elbow. These things that I always assumed were basics.</p>
<p>So for the maskers it's a convenient reason to be lazy and by how they all repeat the mantra of hOw HaRd Is It To WeAr A mAsK, it only makes this clearer in my head. They don't think about all those other hygiene things, these are behaviours that would go largely unnoticed compared to masks that are a constant visual reminder. So that's how they equate us not having a mask as granny killers because they have such a tunnel vision on masks being the difference between getting covid or not. All this other stuff we do is invisible to them.</p>
<p>One other concerning thing is that from what I've read in those other subreddits, they seem to assume that people just cough and sneeze as a deliberate projection in front of them. So again no mask equals we also intend to directly infect them. I'm going to take a stab and say they are again projecting their own behaviours on us.</p>
<p>And even if you do have a mask on if you coughed or sneezed directly into it then now you have a dirty potentially infectious thing on your face all day. I have a suspicion they wouldnt think to change it out for a fresh one amongst other things.</p>
<p>I almost want to keep going and cover some other stuff but this already ended up longer than I originally thought. I've just had a lot of weird emotions tonight (4.30am in Victoria, Australia), my gym has just very recently gone back to being 24/7 and I just had one of only a few moments this year where I felt happy. A moment where I got to finally live as a real human. Lockdown here made me kinda want to die because my life has so much more meaning than watching netflix all day and this year was stolen from me. Stolen from all of us. Even as restrictions have eased, there were and still are too many reminders of this shitshow of a year. </p>
<p>I feel for all of you that are getting into more and more bullshit lockdowns, mask mandates etc etc.
People here in other states basically thought we Victorians were weak for struggling. That we all needed to toughen up because aT lEaSt YoU aReN't DeAd.
You can't know what it's like until you're in this situation. So I get it, I truly get it. </p>
<p>Lastly since I just mentioned it, if you're feeling like self harming or considering suicide then please call a hotline. </p>
<p>Much love to you all. Keep being the only decent people in this world. Fuck the new normal xx</p></p>

        <p>Along with masks. Think about where they’ve been and how dirty they are. People think they’re protected and fiddle with their masks etc. While they do that they could be transmitting dead virus (from all the sterilization) to their mask and into their nasal cavity. The PCR test can’t differentiate between dead or alive virus and the primer probes actually only cover half the viral genome so it can’t even detect intact virus vs virus fragments. Side note: the PCR can’t differentiate between any sars or coronavirus as there are no negative or positive controls either and the genes used for detection are common to most, if not all, corona viruses. That, plus other failures of the PCR test, combined with the ridiculous number of cycles can lead up to a 97% false positive rate. And now you have your casedemic. </p>

<p>There are links included to the academic articles. It is a bit dense. But the gist of it is that the majority of deaths were caused by bacterial pnumonia (which fauci wrote his paper on), which has been proven to be a consequence of long-term mask use (other papers).</p>

        <p>Except that numerous people like my mother who only wore the mask when she went to the store (not at home) died from this virus.</p>
<p>Time to admit the truth here: This is a lethal virus to a good percentage of the populace with minor pre-ex's. A lethal and unprecedented vascular (attacks blood vessels in your body including arteries and veins) virus to a good percentage of the populace.</p>
<p>Does that mean that the masks and lockdowns are the proper way to go around this? No. Both in my opinion are health theater.</p>

        <p>My uncle died in retirement home because they put covid patients there and we were not allowed to see him. Then they cancelled baseball. The two things that kept him going, seeing his family and baseball. Then when he died we could not have a funeral. He did nothing but provide for his family and work his whole life and because of "health theatre" he just faded from existence and died alone like he had nobody.</p>
<p>Health theatre costs lives. Yes, I dont argue covid is real. But 1 million people die from mosquito bourne diseases every year and in 2019 1.4 million people died of tuberculosis. Death and disease are conditions of life. Doesnt mean we let the government play god and ruin the modern world trying to fix diseases that have been happening since life itself came into existence. The UN said months ago, more people will starve to death in the 3rd world as a result of the economic devastation of lockdowns, than covid itself.</p>

        <p>I think public mask wearing does very little (if anything) in regards to transmission of covid 19. </p>
<p>That being said, what masks do accomplish has to do with human behavior. People don’t socially distance when they are wearing masks. They act like they have some magic protective force field around them. This may have gotten some at risk people killed since people thought they were “protected” when in fact, they weren’t. </p>
<p>So from that standpoint, masks might actually be making things worse.</p>

        <p>Even social distancing does not do anything. We have had documented cases of people with actual CoVid-19 symptoms who had not been out of their homes in 6 months who ended up eventually getting CoVid-19 without leaving their homes.</p>
<p>At this point and I know I am going to be called a tin-foil hat, insane, etc. but I wonder if this virus is being intentionally spread to keep it going somehow.</p>

        <p>I’ve been saying this from the drop. I’m not sure if they are causing people to catch covid, but they sure as fuck don’t make a difference. These idiots wear their facial covid invisibility cloak and open mouth cough, never wash their hands and feel good about themselves because they’re “stopping the spread.”</p>

        <p>Eh, it seems like no matter what we do, the new case as well as hospitalization and death statistics are not correlating with any of the measures that have been implemented in the way that they “should” if these were scientifically backed. I don’t think the masks (on or off) are the reason for anything. Just a placebo band-aid that ended up being a reaaallly divisive one.</p>

        <p>It's common sense, you put a bacteria super spreader on your face and inhale through it constantly, end up sick, get diagnosed as probable covid, and the cycle perpetuates.  Any mention of this triggers a leftie face diaper enthusiast to throw out a personal attack and dismiss this simple logic as baseless or without proof.</p>

        <p>The science is solid that masks are innefective at preventing viral transmission. </p>
<p>N95 masks are the only ones that will prevent virus droplets and aerosols from getting through. The 95 in the name is because they claim about 95% of particulates are filtered. Which is true.</p>
<p>Surgical masks will filter about 40-50%, under perfect conditions like being sealed to your face with tape. Otherwise it's less effective and possibly worthless if worn incorrectly or reused.</p>
<p>Cloth masks are like anti N95s, they let in about 95% of particulates and are thus completely worthless. </p>

        <p>Which is of course what Fauci and SAGE said at the start of all this, before realising that it was a good way of gauging compliance at a glance. </p>
<p>Then Fauci says later he only said that to stop people panic buying PPE and depriving healthcare workers of it. </p>
<p>Read that as “I am totally prepared to lie to you about this potential threat to public health for the sake of political expedience, but you should believe everything I say anyway”. </p>

        <p>Masks suck, but the cases are rising due to the tests which give false positives. It wouldn't surprise me though If the elites release something through those tests, after all the tests are shoved up peoples noses which could cause a real virus to go to the brain quickly.</p>
