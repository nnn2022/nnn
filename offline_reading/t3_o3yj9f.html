        <p>This pandemic gave the gift of time. Not to all but to many. In some cases that gift of time was a nightmare.  While I got to spend more time with my sons and my aging pup that doesn't have many years left others were locked away with abusive parents or spouses. To those unfortunate souls, time was not kind and was not a gift, it was a neverending nightmare that was only supposed to be 15 days. </p>
<p>As 15 days turned into 400 this gift of time decimated businesses and entire economies. These people who are grateful for this pandemic are the lucky ones in a way, they don't realize they are frogs in a pot, slowly boiling, blissfully unaware. They don't realize that they are a minor background detail in somebody else's story. </p>
<p>It's not a happy story, it's a story about freedom dying. It's a story about how they are pleased about a genetically engineered virus killing many and bringing the world to it's knees. About governments stepping in to save the day by force, by eliminating rights and freedoms, by instituting policies that will scar society for generations.</p>

        <p>I mean that is s Pretty good reason right on the screen shot. Both parents working and sending a baby to be looked after in a day care by a min wage workers ASAP is also a new normal, and like the current new normal sucks.</p>

        <p>I’m not exactly grateful for it, but if nothing else, I am glad the plandemic was able to wake me and so many people up to the globalist conspiracy that we once dismissed as nonsense. I don’t think I could have woken up otherwise.</p>

        <p>I’m not pro lockdowns but any means but I would have been totally screwed. A week before COVID  hit the us over a year ago I severely injured my knee skiing(ruptured patellar tendon). I was was completely unable to work that summer as I’m an arborist, and unemployment was able to help me get by. It’s been 6 months since I’ve been on it. Once I was able to work again I had no desire to to sit around any longer.</p>
