    <strong>Everyday people in my life are making me more skeptical</strong>
    <p><p>I'm usually a pretty go with the flow type of person. I was never involved with politics and just tried to live my normal life doing good where I can. However, I feel like the world has turned upside down and suddenly to my friends I'm a "conspiracy theorist" for having questions and doubts about the pandemic. I considered getting the vaccine until I started to have some questions and was told I shouldn't be questioning it and should just take it. I didn't have as many concerns until I started hearing that and now I'm super skeptical. Why are people so adamant on forcing it on everyone as quickly as possible? I adopted a plant based diet a few years ago while in college and it improved my health so much. I've always been a thin person, but I noticed it changed my energy and mood in ways I'll always be so grateful for. Many people I know are overweight and consume fast food garbage daily, yet are telling me what is supposed to be healthy? It's just bizarre to me because I live such a healthy and active lifestyle and I see so many people that are weakening their immune systems more and more everyday lecturing everyone about health. I see many girls my age posting on social media about getting the vaccine in one post, and then a ton of alcohol and bad food the next. I don't judge anyone for their eating habits, but I also don't care to be lectured about health from people who clearly don't take care of themselves.</p></p>

        <p>Our entire society is structured around keeping people as ignorant and compliant as possible, from cradle to grave. Kudos to you for managing to maintain your intelligence despite all that, and leading by example.</p>

        <p>I’m pretty similar to you in all regards. Was super excited about the vaccines at first but the pushback against anyone with questions or concerns is baffling and honestly scary. There has to be something bigger going on for it to warrant the kind of censorship and pushback that is going on. I was never a conspiracy theorist in the slightest but this has left me with so many questions.   Especially now with some of the media spins on the variants. I just want to know what is really going on but with all the censorship I’m afraid there is no way we will ever know. At this point I’m just going with my own gut instincts on things.</p>

        <p>Yes. The same thing happened with the election. Did Biden win? Sure, I'll believe it when it's shown to me. Never happened. I was labelled a conspiracy theorist for doubting. The media non-stop for weeks demanded you see that Biden won, and Trump lost. It was terrifying. It was staged.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of Biden voters that had buyer's remorse immediately after the election. People I wouldn't have thought to have voted for him. There's a lot more idiots out there than you think. Aside from that there was fraud, I just feel there was. But there's a lot of misinformed voters too.</p>

        <p>I did this. If I knew everything he’d do, I would’ve voted trump. I don’t particularly like the guy but at least he didn’t make such colossal, harmful changes like biden has. (Taken away women’s rights too)</p>

        <p>They did a good job of toting the 'unity', 'inclusive' crap. It was great at face-value. Oh and the first woman POC VP whatever she is was a good selling point too. Those who don't know any better... I guess I maybe understand it a little. HOWEVER, if you're going to cast a vote you should be informed. Voting is a privilege.</p>

        <p>It’s scary.  I feel like the world around us is a simulation.  A veil has been lifted that I can’t unsee and I’ve never trusted anything less in my life.  Everything is a lie.  Sometimes I think I’m the crazy one.  But I’m not.  And thankfully my husband has come to the same conclusions-we’ve come to many of the same on our own only to realize the other was thinking it too.  I’m thankful to have him as a reality check.</p>

        <p>Why? Did you not find it odd that Trump over preformed in every single community, black, Asian, latin, rural, and swept Florida and Ohio before Arizona was suddenly called for Biden? Was that not odd? especially when almost every media outlet agreed it was way too early? </p>
<p>Was it not odd that Georgia literally stayed open to count votes days on end until the very day they managed to "find" enough voted for Biden? A state that had previously undergone a serious effort by Stacey Abrams and the DNC to "recalibrate" elections? And how MI, WI, and PA found swarthes of mail in ballots in the middle of the night? Granted, I think it's possible Biden won those states, but the whole thing is incredibly fishy.</p>
<p>I feel like its far larger a stretch to say <em>no cheating</em>  occurred than to say it did. A year in which everyone was mailed a ballot, ballot harvesting was legal in many states, meaning poll watchers could simply "correct" the ballots or follow up with potential Dem voters in counties such as Fulton GA until they had enough votes to win. There were windows wide open for cheating, it'd be a miracle if it wasn't utilized. </p>
<p>On top of that, the media reaction to all of this was terrifying. You were made to say Biden won. No room for doubt. How about you prove it. How about we get election pollsters to confirm? How about we get some clarity from Dominion, a company no one has ever heard of which apparently got to run our elections this year and had fake employees on LinkedIN? The thing is, this thing, if it were real, could be proven. The media has gone to greater lengths to yell at doubters than to simply prove it was legitimate. That is suspicious.</p>

        <p>Tons of suspicions. Enough to make me lose faith in the election process. Regardless of the outcome, lots of faults. I personally believe in fraud, but there's so much money thrown at it and so many involved it'll never be revealed.</p>

        <p>The thing is, there are actually explanations for all of these 'anomalies' if you actually do the research. For example, that Trump was leading in several states but then ended up losing them later in the night is well-understood and was widely expected to happen. This was because Republicans were less-likely to take covid-related precautions seriously, and were therefore more likely to vote in person. In these states where in-person votes are counted first, it was expected that Trump would lead initially, but that this lead would be eroded as mail-in votes were counted, and that's exactly what happened.  </p>
<p>You can actually look into every claim of voter fraud if you wish, and discover for yourself that in every case the claims have been disproven... but there's great news! The US justice system has already done it for you. Numerous lawsuits were filed and each one was dismissed. So, either there was no evidence, or the media, the DNC, and the entire American legal system were part of some massive conspiracy to remove Trump from office.</p>
<p>My big question here is - why is it so hard to believe Trump lost? He lost the popular vote in 2016, and throughout his term he had incredibly low approval ratings. The big surprise wasn't that Trump lost, it's that he didn't lose by more.</p>

        <p>Everything you just said there is false. </p>
<p>*1) media outlets reported results as they came in. You don't like what they reported, well that's too bad unless you can actually demonstrate that it was deliberate misinformation </p>
<p>2) the approval ratings come from various polling companies. They are independent of the media who were calling the election. </p>

        <p>Frankly, you don't belong on this sub. You are simply citing the mainstream news back at me. We all here know what the main narrative is. We don't believe it, and for good reason.</p>
<ol>
<li>No, the media does not merely "call things as they come is" as if they were totally separate and therefore should be taken seriously. Arizona was called too early. Many mainstream media companies even said so. So no, results were pre-decided in some instances. Also, it's not the media outlets who count the votes. They don't control the numbers, they simply report what they hear. There seems to be confusion in your argument, just because the media doesn't themselves count the votes doesn't mean they are untainted.  We are arguing that the people who gave the numbers to the media most likely lied. The media was probably in on it, but just because they "gave results as they came in" does not mean there was no fraud, nor does it mean they were not culpable.</li>
<li>Trump approval ratings varied very widely depending on who took the poll. Regardless, polls have proven to be virtually useless, as Trump overpreformed a whopping 10 percent again this year in almost every swing state. MI, WI, and PA had Biden up 10 points. Biden won them by 1-2% a piece. You are simply flat out factually wrong even using mainstream data to point to polls as any indication to Trump's support. Period.</li>

        <p>&rt;Frankly, you don't belong on this sub.</p>
<p>Well, certainly I agree if this sub is just an echo-chamber of misinformation. </p>
<p>&rt;You are simply citing the mainstream news back at me.</p>
<p>There's a reason why mainstream media is mainstream, and part of that reason is that it's reliable. That doesn't mean they are right 100% of the time. </p>
<p>&rt;for good reason.</p>
<p>Debatable. I would say that you believe it for <em>bad</em> reasons. </p>
<p>&rt;Arizona was called too early. Many mainstream media companies even said so. </p>
<p>I think you are confusing the issue here. The decision of whether to call a state is made by looking at how many votes are due to be counted, the likely voting trends in that state/counties left to be counted, and the margin at the time. </p>
<p>What you are missing here is that a) it's those same mainstream media networks who you are calling unreliable who disputed the timing, and b) it might have been premature, but it ended up being correct. </p>
<p>&rt;So no, results were pre-decided in some instances</p>
<p>There's no evidence that that was the case.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, it's not the media outlets who count the votes. They don't control the numbers, they simply report what they hear.</p>
<p>... that's exactly what I said. </p>
<p>&rt;We are arguing that the people who gave the numbers to the media most likely lied.</p>
<p>I know that that's what you believe, but there's no evidence to support that belief. </p>
<p>&rt;Trump approval ratings varied very widely depending on who took the poll.</p>
<p>Ok * a) vary*</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, when polling any issue there will be 'noise' or variation, and it os worth noting that Trump consistently had very high approval ratings amongst Republicans. But the <em>average</em> trend (which is what's important when considering any data set) was that he did very poorly with Democrats and was generally around 30% approval with independent voters. </li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Regardless, polls have proven to be virtually useless</p>
<p>This is false. The polls underestimated support for Trump in both 2016 and 2020, but not by much (about 2% in both cases). That's a far cry from "virtually useless". If the 2020 polls had said that Biden was going to win 40+ states and 75% of the popular vote, I'd agree with you. But they didn't; they forecasted a narrow but probable Biden victory. </p>
<p>&rt;as Trump overpreformed a whopping 10 percent again this year in almost every swing state</p>
<p>Correct. It's certainly interesting. Afaik it's unclear whether this was because traditional polling methods undersample likely Trump voters, or that Trump voters refuse to respond (presumably due to mistrust of the media), or other reasons, or a combination. But it's certainly interesting  </p>
<p>&rt;You are simply flat out factually wrong even using mainstream data to point to polls as any indication to Trump's support. Period.</p>
<p>Again, that's an exaggeration. Polls possibly underestimated Trumps support to a degree. But they did accurately capture that he is wildly popular amongst Republicans, so clearly they aren't completely off-base.</p>

        <p>First, I laugh when you say "mainstream is mainstream because it is reliable". It's as if you didn't just see this week a CNN executive admit that the network used its platform as a propaganda machine against Trump. Here you go : <a href="https://abcnews4.com/news/nation-world/project-veritas-says-it-caught-cnn-staffer-admitting-network-pushed-anti-trump-propaganda">https://abcnews4.com/news/nation-world/project-veritas-says-it-caught-cnn-staffer-admitting-network-pushed-anti-trump-propaganda</a></p>
<p>Of course, this does go both ways. Fox news is unreliable as well. Media outlets used to be more reliable, but here's another hard fact for you: Nearly 60% of Americans do not trust the media. <a href="https://www.axios.com/media-trust-crisis-2bf0ec1c-00c0-4901-9069-e26b21c283a9.html">https://www.axios.com/media-trust-crisis-2bf0ec1c-00c0-4901-9069-e26b21c283a9.html</a></p>
<p>Ok, that squares away your laughable first retort. No, the mainstream media is not mainstream because it is reliable. It is mainstream because they have the money, the established platform, and the ability to spread their message to you constantly. </p>
<p>Second, for some reason, you feel the need to argue with me over Arizona. Here you go, my intelligent friend, a list of articles from mainstream sources that you enjoy so much saying it was a bad call: <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/calls-that-biden-won-arizona-should-be-retracted-says-fivethiryeights-nate-silver">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/calls-that-biden-won-arizona-should-be-retracted-says-fivethiryeights-nate-silver</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/12/penn-professors-2020-election-biden-trump">https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/12/penn-professors-2020-election-biden-trump</a></p>
<p>Of course, you're also leaving out why this matters. Arizona was called abruptly right after Trump had handedly won both Florida and Ohio. Both were states categorized as a toss up just before the election, and were the first toss ups to be decided that night. By winning both, Trump's path to victory became pretty likely. By tossing out Arizona, room for doubt erupted about Trump's chances. Suddenly Trump didn't seem that strong. Maybe people would believe when he now went on to lose the next seven or eight states. So the fact is, AZ was called too early, and while we don't know why, this is likely the reason. </p>
<p>Now, your next argument is illogical. You conclude that because neither of us can prove how trustful out elections are, you must be right. This is also laughable. </p>
<p>Many people believe the election was rigged. <a href="https://morningconsult.com/form/tracking-voter-trust-in-elections/">https://morningconsult.com/form/tracking-voter-trust-in-elections/</a></p>
<p>Now, the common argument that mainstream uses is that "there are no substantiated claims that voter fraud happened". Well, the only, and I mean only, way you can be sure of an election is to have people vote in person, or have extremely tight mail in regulations. Voter ID.  These precautions were not taken in many important locations in 2020. You know they weren't. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/ballots-can-t-be-tossed-out-over-voter-signature-court-n1244585">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/ballots-can-t-be-tossed-out-over-voter-signature-court-n1244585</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/montana-ballot-audit-shows-risks-mail-vote-fraud-opinion-1580705">https://www.newsweek.com/montana-ballot-audit-shows-risks-mail-vote-fraud-opinion-1580705</a></p>
<p>Just as I cannot prove to you there were fake ballots, you cannot prove to me that they were not fake. Just like currency only has value when it is agreed upon by a society, our election integrity only exists when the public trusts it. There is no way to really know for sure, but especially not now when every registered voter in a county gets a ballot and nobody afterwards is able to follow it. As in the case of the above cited PA instance, in which one cannot discard a mail in ballot if the signature does not match. Lunacy. </p>
<p>Finally, do not say "false" to me and then fail to definitively prove you are correct. That's just god awful rhetoric. Saying "Certainly. Afaik it's unclear whether this was because traditional polling methods undersample likely Trump voters," prohibits you from asserting I am incorrect for saying the polls were wrong. You are literally agreeing with me and then providing an explanation for why the polls were wrong. And here's the facts of the polling errors:</p>
<p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/wisconsin/">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/wisconsin/</a> Biden up by 10 average. He won by less than 2. That's an outstanding 8 percent. Trump also went on to overperform in Texas, Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina. The only state he underperformed was Arizona, which again should make you scratch your head.</p>
<p>The polls are wrong, dead wrong.\</p>
<p>I think you're right, however, to say that they miss Trump voters because they don't want to admit they are Trump voters. However, that is a glaring problem and forces polls to be inaccurate. As far as that goes,  you can be sure that any time a pollster calls about a controversial issue, the responses are not going to be truthful. So then what's the point?</p>
<p>Anyways, long response. I urge you to think more critically. Your arguments are baseless and only supported by the fact that the mainstream media has managed to convince other lazy-brained Americans as well. This sub is the minority of critically thinking people left in the Western world. I hope you'll join us.</p>

        <p>Most people are sheeple and conformists. They feel more comfortable being told what to do and how to think. We have been brainwashed to accept anything that our leaders and so called professionals/experts tell use without verifying it ourselves. Our educational system is set up that way: dont question anything, just obay. </p>
<p>Some people wake up and realise that most of what we've learned is total bullshit. Most never reach that level of awareness. You are surrounded by robots. They are capable of parroting information, even highly intelligent people fall in this category. But other than repeating acquired knowledge, they lack the most useful skillset: critical thinking/common sense. </p>
<p>That falls outside their basic programming.</p>

        <p>I see this especially with my parents. My mom grew up in a socialist system and is already 22 years longer on this planet than me. And yet, she doesn’t question anything, she even defends this whole farce and the politicians profiting from it. You’d think she must’ve known better, but she‘s super ignorant about everything and just consumes the propaganda all day, that we’re being forced to pay by our government. In the past, they also never cared about anything that was going on around them, as long as they were making money and were well fed. They never cared about self-improvement. My mom was always whining about how awful it was to grow up in a socialist country and now says things like ‚it was good that they all force-vaccinated us in school, it was so important for our society‘. Wtf? You escaped this system for being anti-individualism and now you’re cheering about authoritarian behavior? They’re really lost causes. It’s like with parents who get beaten by their parents and promise to themselves that they’ll never do this to their children and then will continue to do the same as their parents did to them. I thought people 22 years older than me, should see the signs of our current times, but nope they’re pretty happy with everything right now..:/</p>

        <p>It's sad to see that your mother hasn't learned the most valuable lesson: seeing the parallels between her past and the current political climate. History keeps repeating itself and there isnt a god darn thing we can do about it. Take the vaccine passport for instance. It's akin to the yellow star Jews were forced to sew onto their coats.  Now the digital equivelant is being introduced. We're reintroducing a caste system were non-compliant citizens will be stripped of certain basic human rights. These parias will be forces to ghettoize.</p>
<p>It is sad to see so many liberals promoting socialism when there is demonstrable evidence that this ideology has a fail rate of 100% that lead to millions of deaths. You'd think intelligent people would abhor such destructive ideology. Nope!! They hold onto this fantasy that humans are only bad due to external circumstrances. And confince themselves that socialism hasnt been implemented the RIGHT way. Also notice that many people took to the streets a few years back complaining about the need for more gun control. Conservatives knew that importance of self defence. Their argument was that guns were to protect us from tyranical a government. Liberals could not fathom that ever happening. "The government will protect us!!!" they yelled. Now look at the tyrany governments all around the world are inflicting on their populace. It only now that some liberals with their idealic view on reality have gotten a reality check. Most of them are still sleep walking. The wont learn until it's to late.</p>
<p>Im sorry to say this but majority of humans are idiots. They will let their emotions dictate their lives. We all know instances were very intelligent people get swindled by smooth talking beautiful people. Common sense and critical thinking triumps intelligence in most instances.</p>
<p>A good example of this is my pops. I told him that in a TedTalk lecture of Bill Gates he mentioned reducing the world population with vaccines. My pops immediate reaction was calling it FAKE NEWS. "You shouldnt believe everything you hear. It could have been taken out of context" he said. This man is vastly more intelligent than I am. But sadly he has been indoctrinated to such extend that anything that goes against the mainstream media's narrative is discarged immediately. I encouraged him to look at the lecture himself in order to make up his own mind. Nope! Till this day he hasnt bothered doing 20 minutes of research. He would rather take an experimental DNA modifying drugs from the man who made it his live mission to depopulate the world with said vaccines. You cant make this shit up. Learning about Bill Gates evil intentions didnt trigger his curiousity at all. My pops is an old fool who will go to his early grave for nothing. Some people are deeply indoctrinated and feel threatened when you challange their believes. The call themselves open-minded but in reality they are anything but that. These are the most dangerous types. They will rat you out to the authorities for brownie points. These are the very people who will push and enforce the draconian rules upon their fellow man. Policing their own kind without the need for authority to be present.</p>

        <p>My husband just left for his.  I've warned him all along not to get it and he has fought me on it.  I tried to persuade once more before his appointment today to not get it.  As we were sitting there he jumped up and said "omg my appt is at 4 not 4:30".  The clock was showing 3:50.  Tell me that isn't a sign from above but whatever.... let him be a test subject.  He has a higher chance of getting killed in a car accident on the way to get the vaccine then he does of getting the vaccine.  Idiot.</p>

        <p>Maintain the status quo, we're all taught. We're inherently programmed to not upset the herd. I wear a mask into a store because I don't want to cause a scene or argue. I'm a very skeptical person though. I don't buy into anything without researching it on my own. Stay skeptical. It's not a fault. This whole pandemic is a prime example of why peer pressure isn't a good thing. Big issue, small issue, have a mind of your own.</p>

        <p>Serious thought: I am worried that what is happening in America is what happened to Germany right before Hitler took over. The government slowly became more and more oppressive, and the masses just rolled with it for far too long. Many Jews did not take leave because they did not think things would go so far. Like a frog in boiling water, the temperature slowly rises and you don't know to get out until suddenly, you're boiled alive. </p>
<p>Perhaps sometime next year those people in liberal states will realize at last that they are being forced under an authoritarian state to take shots, stay home, receive welfare, and obey a President who was not elected. </p>
<p>I worry if we're at such a point. That in a few years we'll look back and say "how did they not realize what had happened? Why did they submit?" And it is for the reasons we are, as a community, aware of. The masses are brainwashed, have been herded into a new governmental order, and will be trapped before too long.</p>
