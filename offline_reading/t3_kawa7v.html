    <strong>Why were you all so mean to this girl?</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j4vdm5/this_is_what_i_just_posted_to_a_karen_subreddit/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</p>
<p>Before you start questioning why I’m doing this for a stranger, well, I’m actually friends with this girl so I’m standing up for her. She posted something to a subreddit called ‘Entitled Karens’, in the majority of the publics eyes (the ones who aren’t truly awake), a Karen is someone who won’t wear a mask or is anti-lockdown, but what they don’t see is that most of the people that will refuse to comply are not brainwashed or crazy at all, they just won’t comply to the lies. The New Normal, hence your subreddit name? What does this have to do with my friends post? (By the way she told me this so that’s how I know) Well, she thought she’d share this with you, thinking you’d agree with her or something. I decided to visit the post myself. Here’s what you said, and here’s why I disagree; </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some of you said you don’t like the term Karen. Understandable, Karen is a stupid term and all the people I know named Karen are lovely, she kept using the term Karen in her post to get across to the other people. She then agreed with those people and said she doesn’t like the term Karen either, she just used it to appeal to the people of that subreddit. There was this one post where someone put a term and said the definition, obviously referring to my friend and how she agreed that Karen is a bad term. It said something like “someone who contradicts themselves”. How rude is that honestly? You know who you are. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of you said “this is not an anti-vax or anti-mask thread.” I get it, being aware and cautious of the enforcements of the current situation does not mean you’re anti vax. But people said “I am a fan of vaccines and anti-mask is pro-death.” Yet you dismiss the New Normal??? The New Normal IS the masks! That’s the main part of it. You say you’re against the New Normal but that’s a lie you’re all for it if you seriously think that people who won’t wear a masks want death for people. There’s also a flair for vaccines on here too. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of you made fun of her and called her “not very responsible of you”. There’s no need for an explanation, that’s just rude and ‘not very responsible of you’. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By the way this girl was actually only 13 when she posted this and she was probably the youngest and most responsible person on here who sees the truth. She’s also really sensitive and you did actually hurt her so think about who you could be talking to before you say anything. I know she’s really distressed by the world situation and we are both worried about what will happen to us when we and our families refuse to oblige.</p></p>

        <p>I think you need to realize that people come to this sub from the outside to intentionally troll, harass, and insult people. I suspect your friend ran into some of these.</p>
<p>Your friend is very young so I suspect she may not be able to recognize this or let it roll off if she does. These people love to suck people into arguments by initiating a reaction through insults and inflammatory language.</p>
<p>Bullies want you to feed into their spite. As the saying goes, kill them with kindness. When you don't give them the response they want to get out of you they will give up and find someone else to pick on.</p>

        <p>This sub is a pretty wide mix of people who disagree with new changes to society as a whole. I thought her response was received well besides the fact that she ran into a few people that disagree with her. Tell her not to let it get to her.</p>

<li>
<p>I'm anti VAX fully, I'm not just against this upcoming wicked VAX im against them ALL. So whether this sub is anti VAX or not, does not change MY personal stance. So there is people out there who aren't for any vaccines, so you're friend isn't alone. </p>

<li>
<p>I agree, but your friend needs to learn to ignore people like that. In fact Its best to not even reply to hateful comments. </p>
