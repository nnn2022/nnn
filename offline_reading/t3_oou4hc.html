    <strong>I heard this story recently.</strong>
    <p><p>So I was listening to a popular alternative media talk show. The host was taking calls for anyone who took the vaccine and share their experiences, good or bad. </p>
<p>Someone called in and said she didn't take it, but her grandfather did and had some issue where he had to go to the hospital (I think it may have been heart or blood clot related. Can't quite remember).</p>
<p>She said that he had to omit that he thought it was from the vaccine, because health insurance wouldn't pay for it if it was a vaccine injury. She didn't say why he thought this.</p>
<p>Does anyone have more info on this? Wouldn't everyone going to the hospital be excluded since most people have gotten it? If this is the case, maybe this is why hospitals aren't reporting these cases as vaccine injuries to VAERS, and anywhere else on paperwork. Because they want it to be paid for by insurance.</p>
<p>I would also like to know about life insurance. Are beneficiaries being denied payouts from vaccine murdered policy holders?</p></p>

        <p>I wonder if that's an attempt to get people to shut up about it. Patient desperately needs medical attention. So they don't mention vaccine. Doctors don't have to write up vaccine damage. Wow, this is incredible. People are not being told how few their choices are if they take this risk. It's actually ironic. They want to feel included, but they are doing something that will leave them excluded.</p>

        <p>Incentives matter. If you can see what the incentives are, it’s quite easy to assume how a person will respond to them (assuming that person knows the incentives as well).</p>
<p>Vaccine manufacturers are exempt from liability. If the cause of your medical issue is vaccine related, you’re on your own. OR, you can try and pass it off as unrelated and maybe get covered. </p>
<p>What choice do you think most people make, patients and doctors alike? Doctors want to be paid, patients don’t want to pay.</p>
