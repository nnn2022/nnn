    <strong>A case study with a surprising twist.</strong>
    <p><p>I came across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o369yf/men_becoming_infertile_after_getting_covid19/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">post</a> that had four reports for misinformation that can be used as a demonstration and point for discussion about the role of moderators on the sub.</p>
<p>The post/video is about the risk of infertility in men due to the covid vaccine but we don't even have to debate that part per se because it's just a locals news story that does the talking and the story appears legit (at least at face value).</p>
<p>However, if you make it to the end you will see some guy pop in at the end and directly contradict what the doctor from the news clip actually says 2:32 Dr. says: "this doesn't mean don't get the vaccination" which is directly followed by "yes, you should avoid this vaccine" and then goes on to say a bunch of different things ending with "it is poison and it will kill you".  I don't want to get into potential harms of the vaccines because there is obviously a lot of real concerns about that addressed elsewhere that are now finally starting to be discussed in mainstream media.</p>
<p>And now for the twist.</p>
<p>The fact that this commentator at the end directly contradicts the doctor in such an obvious way seemed a little funny to me so I dug into the account and saw some an account history that is one of two things: an account that appears to be designed to spread disinformation and also connect that with the type of things that will get subs banned from Reddit.  The history includes white supremacy, a UFOs+Hitler combination, anti-Semitism and pretty much emphasizes what I would imagine Reddit would consider contributing to a "culture of hate" rounded off with some germ theory denialism that has been popping up from a few users on nonewnormal as well.  </p>
<p>Could this be an authentic user?  Sure.  Regardless of that question this account compromises us all and aside from the ban risk which is the primary concern, it discredits the entire sub and brings us closer to the darkness and hatred that our enemies want us to be pushed into.  By doing this, it is easier to not only silence us but further the marginalization we are already facing due to our personal health choices.</p>
<p>I am not perfect but all I ask is for people to trust me and know that I'm just doing what's best for the sub and the top priority is keeping the lights on.  If myself or another moderator doesn't do something right we should talk about it but the conversation is a non-starter if it's a launching off point to create distrust and dissent among users.  It is a constantly evolving challenge to counter the many forces that are against us who are now stronger than ever in spite of finally being at least partially vindicated by mainstream media.</p></p>
