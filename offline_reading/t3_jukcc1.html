    <strong>Virtue signaling at its finest</strong>
    <p><p>Literally everyone on this site and in real life act they care about the health of others when in reality, they don't.</p>
<p>I live in DC and literally no one ever gave a shit about eachother until this pandemic started, but now all of a sudden everyone pretends to care about one another? Okay, bullshit. People will tell you to cover your face with a thin sheet of t-shirt because they "care about you" then drive past a hobo high on crack in the middle of the road like its no big deal.</p></p>

        <p>Look up Dunbar's Number.   Human's can only maintain 'feels' for about 150 people, and deep feels for about 5.</p>
<p>No one actually fucking cares about the people they don't know that get sick or die from any cause.  What you see in normal times is a logical assertion that it's bad, and how awful, this is terrible, etc, but we really don't FEEL anything beyond a superficial emotion then we're getting on with our own lives.</p>
<p>People don't GAF now either - but they DO enjoy the attaboys they get from being virtue signalers and the moral authority.</p>

        <p>I think the problem is that people gain some short-term artificial feelings (ie empathy) for people who died because of how the media spins things..."fit healthy guy in his 20s dies" means that a lot of people feel afraid because they can imagine themselves in the same position. They don't necessarily care about the guy who died but they do care about themselves...when bad things happen to people like them, they get scared.</p>

        <p>Same here, I would say from the point of view of someone who was more of an outcast than anything that this is one of the rudest, most anti-social places I ever lived but now all of a sudden everyone cares? Bullshit. I been that person collecting bottles before this kicked me off that source of small income that I'm now sitting on cause I have no idea if I'll ever able to do it without being bothered ever again by these exact bullies that suddenly "care so much about me". Or at least less bothered than before. I've seen the ugly underbelly of this society and this is the biggest act I've ever seen these good, sheltered, normal people put up. Behind closed doors the real mask comes off. If there's anything I hate the most it's dishonesty in people with themselves and others. Stop trying to be a good person and represent who you are with whatever good or bad that comes with it.</p>

        <p>I think it’s quite clear that at least with some of them, their extreme quickness to wish death on anyone who doesn’t agree with them indicates they don’t actually care about other people.</p>

        <p>If people truly have a shit they'd be sitting outside bars waiting for drunk drivers. But they don't. Because that's too much work. Drunk driving kills far mar than bullshit Covid. But they only want to virtue signal to others on the internet.</p>

        <p>The best is many of the elite people have made public statements decrying overpopulation and complaining there’s too many people in this world. Now all of a sudden they care about the sick and elderly?! Not a chance.</p>
