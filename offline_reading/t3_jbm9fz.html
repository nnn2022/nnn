        <p>I mean yeah let’s ignore any progress that we’ve made as a human race that means we don’t have to live as hard a life as someone 100 years ago. Our grandparents did work incredibly hard to make our lives better than theirs. They succeeded. We don’t need to artificially recreate the pains they freed us from.</p>

        <p>A Norwegian guy on Facebook tries to justify the lockdown and mask wearing, in addition calling the new generation out for complaining or what's called for "Karen behavior" in the US.</p>
<p>What I think the guy don't know is that the lockdown has caused mass unemployment, economic crisis, poverty, unfair treatment of disabled and delayed medical treatment. I don't think the lockdown skeptical or the "No new normal" people's concern are unnecessary. We're not spoiled either. We just have a different opinion and don't think a lockdown is a good long-term solution for a virus reminding of a flu.</p>

        <p>None of the shit spewed in that post matters. It's simply a case of: are the lockdowns NEEDED, or not? And we all know they're not. So, regardless of the type of life you're living and regardless of whether you're a billionaire born in the 1920's or an unemployed crackhead in the 2020's, unneeded shit like liberty restricting lockdowns imposed by overreaching governments should not exist. His whole post is based on the idea that lockdowns work / save lives. They don't. Definitely not on the long run. Temporary lockdowns like those advertised at the beginning of this whole ordeal (flatten the curve, don't overburden the medical system) are fine. No one was against that at that time (I was, because the whole thing seemed so overly dramatic but I believe I am in the minority).</p>
