        <p>I suggest it's all part of the plan to give a taste of "normalcy" before slamming down harder authoritarian measures for one reason or another.  Spike in cases, new varient, whatever.  I hope I'm wrong.  Really I do so let's see what happens.  ü§ûüèª</p>

        <p>Came here to say the same. I would love to be excited about it but it's not like the governors who lifted these restrictions are just good, kind, freedom loving patriots.</p>
<p>It's not that simple.</p>
<p>You don't get to a position that high in this world unless you are a direct collaborator with concentrated wealth.</p>
<p>There's a small chance that the interests they answer to have a conflict of interest with the global agenda that is driving the Covid authoritarianism... But it's more likely that it is coordinated for some other reason.</p>
<p>Maybe it's to give the illusion that this isn't centrally controlled. Maybe it's a brief respite before a Covid-21 or 23 strikes.</p>
<p>Remember, the global Covid response is linked to the global debt crisis and financial collapse which kicked off in September 2019 when the repurchase-agreement market between banks shot up to over 10%. Fed intervention and media propagandized that into blowing over, but remember that 2008 began with a run up in the repo markets.</p>
<p>The advances in authoritarianism and surveillance will prove useful when people finally feel the weight of the collapse. Protests will be much harder, now that they have a precedent of viruses with invisible symptoms they can separate us for.</p>
<p>We have an economic crisis and bubble situation that is more significant than any in history. It's what all of this is really about.</p>
<p>So we haven't heard the end of this just yet... But these brief relaxations of authority create the illusion of freedom that is required to keep people going to work every day and pretending things are okay.</p>
<p>But in the end, it will prove more similar to how businesses are tricked into opening and closing, repeatedly, until they are finally broken.</p>

        <p>Hong Kong democracy demonstrations--suppressed.  A year later many organizers have been jailed or threatened into giving up.</p>
<p>Mail-in election engineered and sold to the American people.  It was a selection, not an election.</p>
<p>Trillions fleeced from taxpayers all over the world by governments printing and spending money.</p>
<p>Global economic patterns disrupted, favoring multinational big business over small, local, private businesses.  </p>
<p>The elites have benefitted enormously from COVID.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished, they now need to let up a bit, lest we revolt for real.</p>

        <p>It's theatre and don't fall for the bait, those restrictions that are being lifted are being done only to introduce a more dangerous 'strain' to look people down, curious on what your theory is</p>
