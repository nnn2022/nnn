    <strong>I don't know if this sort of thing is allowed but I need to vent...</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like almost an outcast for the feelings I have. I have life pretty well yet the pandemic has changed me and broke me down. I'm no longer the same happy person I once was even with a family and girlfriend. Don't get me wrong just because I'm not happy doesn't mean my relationship with anyone is bad. It's just..Waking up to the same thing ... Everyday I wake up and go to work ... Have to look for a new job on top of that... On top of that I have to worry about my weight ... On top of that I need to make sure wherever me and the girlfriend settle down is alright ... I'm dealing with all of this everyday on top of the pandemic not allowing me to take a break from it all ... My state and county is still strictly mandating shit ... I could just start focusing on my weight but I'm just so unmotivated ... I wake up each day just wanting a break from the everyday routine ... Everyday I'm waking up not wanting to be here anymore ... I keep fighting because I know my family and girlfriend would be devastated if I left ... I'm sorry that I'm weak and selfish ... For wanting things to be normal ... To be able to go out with friends ... Take the girlfriend out on a trip to the city ... I could technically go out but it wouldn't help ... I would just be dealing with the restrictions ... I know a lot of you probably don't understand how I could have it good yet still feel like this ... I honestly don't know either ... Perhaps I really had a passion for traveling and to have that taken away is so disheartening ...... Don't get me wrong I wouldn't do anything harmful to myself or anyone ... It's just man as long as the restrictions are in place I continue to feel angry, numb and broken.</p></p>

        <p>That’s because you aren’t a robot, you are a human. You aren’t designed to complete the same repetitive tasks day in and day out. I live in a very open state. I have been able to look forward to golf with the wife and friends in the spring. Camping and boating in the summer. High school and college sports with our boys in the fall. By the time winter rolls around all we want to do is hunker down in a warm house and spend the winter watching movies and playing games. I don’t say this to make you envious, but to show why you are down hearted. Under strict control you have nothing to look forward to. When your state relaxes their restrictions you will look at them as a merciful and giving overseer, even though they are allowing you your natural freedoms. It is their plan of control. All I can say is try and find a hobby. Preferably something both you and your girlfriend enjoy. Verbalize your feelings to her so she understands why your mood may be souring. Use it as a bonding time and know that things will get better. Stay strong my friend.</p>

        <p>That’s what THEY want young brother. 
THEY want us divided and miserable, hopeless. It’s much easier to control the show when you’re not getting pushback. 
Stay positive, keep loving. </p>
<p>We’ll get normal back one day. Not today nor tomorrow but we’ll get it back. If not, we’ll take it back.</p>

        <p>I think most of us are feeling this way. I wasn't doing well last April and May. I drank every single night. I started pushing it all out of mind as best I could and things improved a lot. I limited drinking to the weekends. I had started gaining weight rapidly, but managed to stop it over the summer. I now eat only healthy food at work and workout, at home, every single night before bed. Even when I don't want to. I'm still having trouble getting the gut weight off, but the rest of me is all muscle. The water parks have started opening back up and can't require masks. Maybe you can take her to one. The national parks don't require masks if you can maintain distance. That's another option. Maybe get some bicycles and take them on trails. I've started doing this. </p>
<p>I wish you the best. I know how difficult this is. I'm still working, but they are really pushing the vax. Not sure how much longer it won't be mandatory. But we have to keep trying so we can fight it. We have to fight as long as we can.</p>

        <p>Start small with the getting your weight down, set small achievable goals. Try drinking less (if you do), eat less processed food, opt for more veggies and fruits, and lean protein. Try getting outdoors for some exercise 2-3 times a week, nothing crazy even just walking for a couple hours will do! We play right into their game the more unhealthy we are, we are easier to control when we are constantly sick and tired. I have been there friend, everyone has the power within themself to change.</p>

        <p>You're not alone dear one. Take heart.  i'm glad you came here to share. Know that we care and are here for you. None of this is normal or based on any kind of reputable and legitimate science. I hope you can find some time to ground yourself and take some deep breaths. Start meditation or something that connect you with spirit.  Big hugs.</p>
