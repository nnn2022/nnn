        <p>Yep.</p>
<p>The people who think we will go back to 100% normalcy "soon" are kidding themselves. This will likely go global, and we will need "health passports" to be able to go anywhere.</p>
<p>For instance, want to go to Foot Locker to buy shoes?</p>
<p>Store worker: Ma'am, before I allow you inside, I need to see your health passport.</p>
<p>Ma'am: Here you go. (flashes phone with "green status")</p>
<p>Store worker: Excellent. Go on in.</p>
<p>Want to go to Walmart to pick up groceries?</p>
<p>Store worker: Sir, I need to see your health passport before you can go in.</p>
<p>Sir: Here. (shows a "red status")</p>
<p>Store worker: Sorry, sir, I can't allow you to enter the store if it's red.</p>
<p>Sir: I don't feel sick, though!</p>
<p>Store worker: It doesn't matter. If the status is yellow or red, I can't allow you inside. Sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, and yet again, like with all these videos, they show the people in the future with masks on as well. The masks are never off in these videos.</p>

        <p>Yeah - It will definitely be global - has microsoft written all over it - probably white-labeled to each tyrannical country.  No cell phone no access to society.  I just wish I traveled more before modern society ended, but at least I saw what I did.</p>

        <p>No, you didn't even have that, you were just spotted by a surveillance camera visiting the house of a known dissident, therefore you now get red status as a precaution for the next 14 days.  Enjoy the future.</p>

        <p>A lot of people think the vaccine will bring us back to normal. I’m not exactly buying that. I could see why they’d think that way, though. “It’s just an app”, “It’s just a few seconds of inconvenience before entering a public place”, etc. making it seem trivial for an illusion of normalcy.</p>
<p>However, I can see this system used to keep the sick quarantined and to possibly punish the unvaccinated turning into a social credit system like China. At that point, it’d be a full fledged tyranny.</p>
<p>This is a trap.</p>

        <p>The comments from my Irish family and those on social media are 99% negative and against this. Good luck to them enforcing this nightmare.</p>
<p>Btw they say it's going to the USA too... plus the UK, and other countries.</p>

        <p>Well, if your Irish family was already anti-lockdown/New Normal, then it makes sense they'd be against this as well. If they weren't, then that's a better sign, I'd say, it means the gravity of the situation is beginning to hit the people who were for the "New Normal".</p>

        <p>Not all of them were against lockdown originally, many were but there were a several who supported it but are 100% against this and it's sort of woken them up. Mostly they supported it as they were fearful for my cousins with a genetic condition who've almost died from viral infections several times each. Some of our friends over there used to support it but are so done now it's clear this virus isn't world ending, and are horrified by this health passport.</p>
<p>Some of the social media comments are by people who have said they used to support some of it but are screaming about how it's all gone too far for a virus with an over 99% survival rate and the irish won't ever accept this etc. People are going off about it big time and its good to see. Literally only saw maybe 3 comments in support. People are disgusted and boycotting those businesses in the trial.</p>

        <p>Irish resident here. My family are in no way awake to what is really going on in the world, and when I try to talk to them about it or gently nudge the subject I am shut down. However, I explained this health passport system to them today, and even my father who usually doesn't entertain me and my "conspiracy theories", was shocked and absolutely not in support of this health passport. I was surprised as I had expected more of "well, its the new normal" commentary. So that's a good sign, it's scary seeing this and I never thought our little island would lead the way in this insane agenda but I'm feeling encouraged at the resistance i have seen so far. Even brands who are affiliated with the system are being boycotted. Hopefully us Irish will lead the way in fighting back - the fighting Irish. :)</p>

        <p>That's good to hear, the health passport with its traffic light system is straight out of China. I knew this health passport was coming and I knew the countries listed included Ireland, UK, USA, Italy etc were on the list to have purchased it. I just didnt think Ireland would be first, not my second home!</p>

        <p>The controversy around contact tracing is mostly a distraction. They have always been tracking everyone to that extent this entire time, it's nothing new. Contact tracing as a general principle in infectious disease is nothing new. Anyone concerned about contact tracing should also be concerned about the current state of privacy with smartphone technology in general and how the upcoming 5G networks take privacy eroding surveillance to the next level.</p>
<p>I say distraction not because it's unimportant (it <em>is</em> important) - but because the even more important thing people should be getting informed about are the topics of mandatory vaccination tying into immunity passports to usher in an entirely re-engineered society ("<a href="https://lbry.tv/@NoNewAbnormal:4/THE-GREAT-RESET-Davos---the-Plot-to-Cancel-Trump:9">The Great Reset</a>") that effectively dissolves national sovereignty and ultimately freedom as you knew it along with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://outline.com/b2A3Ed">Canada</a> is one of the numerous countries that has already signed onto immunity passports. That is why the whole "lockdown until vaccine!" has been a literally treacherous deception this entire time. This agenda is not new, and is not a conspiracy theory.</p>

        <p>I think the contact tracing will also be a part of this (this video claims there will be privacy involved with this app, but I predict they will enact more "contact tracing" type programs as well). As I illustrated above, they will make these passports a requirement to do anything/everything, from going to a store to traveling to attending school to working. It won't be <em>mandatory</em> but if you want to experience any sort of life outside your house, it will be basically mandatory anyhow. And people will use the "But it's a private business or governmental establishment, so they are within their rights to make their own mandates".</p>

        <p>Yes, I do worry about this greatly.  My head is just rattling from the ethical issues around trusting "an app" as the primary means of getting around society, let alone how it could be abused (let alone the fact not everybody has a smart phone) as a computer scientist.  Something like this you could design a whole lecture on what is wrong with doing something like this.  A lack of transparency, the fact they claim one things or another, while expecting you to just "trust" them, but ironically not trust your fellow citizen.  How do you know somebody isn't tinkering with "your profile"?  You'd never know, regardless of the known spottiness of the testing methods and their false positive rates.  "Be a good citizen" they will say, as people are forced to suckle at the tit of mother government and not question it; as you know, the focus on "listen and believe" when it comes to experts is on steroids.  Ethics has been thrown completely aside in the name of a unilateral variant of so-called "safety"; where people just assume you <strong>must</strong> agree with them or else you're the problem or aren't being "safe", despite them adopting a constrictive version of so-called safety that is easily debatable (but isn't, because some people like to control others and some others just like to be told what to do).</p>
<p>I see faulty prescriptive problem solving as the biggest problem this year, the virus is another thing.  The virus didn't force anybody to do this, this was all people's faulty decision making.  People need to correct this path.  The erosion of trust in others will be a massive loss for society.  I think people need to stop blaming everything on COVID-19 ("due to COVID-19") and start looking to those that made the decisions.</p>
