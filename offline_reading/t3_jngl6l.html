    <strong>Amid Covid-19 pandemic, U.S. has seen 300,000 ‘excess deaths'</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/20/cdc-data-excess-deaths-covid-19/">https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/20/cdc-data-excess-deaths-covid-19/</a></p>
<p>&rt; There were also differences among different age groups, with the largest  increase occurring among people age 25 to 44, who saw excess deaths  that were 26.5% higher than average.  </p>
<p>When will people admit that coronavirus restrictions are slaughtering young people?</p>
<p>The data is in. Excess deaths for young people are over 25% higher than average, the highest increase for any age group. The news coverage on this data is nauseating. Mainstream media will not let the idea that lockdowns are murderous cross their lips:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/02/930503932/a-look-at-the-state-of-the-pandemic">https://www.npr.org/2020/11/02/930503932/a-look-at-the-state-of-the-pandemic</a></p>
<p>&rt;CHANG: Well, OK, let's turn back to the U.S., Rob. I mean, infections  are going up. And what we are hearing is that those infections are  mostly among young people. And it would be a mistake - right? - to  assume that young people don't get as sick.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;STEIN: Yeah, that's right. Young people definitely can get  seriously ill and sometimes end up with, you know, long-term  complications and even die. And, in fact, the CDC recently reported that  the biggest increase in excess deaths during the pandemic in the U.S.  has been among people ages 25 to 44. And, you know, younger people -  they can spread the virus to older people.  And right now in the U.S., almost 50,000 people are hospitalized with  COVID. And some hospitals, because of that, are being pushed to the  limit. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I used to enjoy listening to NPR and thought public broadcasting was a benefit of living in a strong democracy. I will not renew my membership to public broadcasting this year and am appalled at the state of news coverage. DEFUND PUBLIC BROADCASTING. If it's Zuckerbergs and Gates' mouthpiece, not one more penny of tax dollars should get flushed down that stool.</p></p>

        <p>Just FYI the 26.5% increase in deaths in the 25-44 yo age group is NOT “missed covid cases.”</p>
<p>We are murdering the young in a vain attempt to save the old. I don’t know how people think this is justified.</p>

        <p>I have a real issue with the CDC Excess Death numbers.</p>
<p>There is a logic trap there.  And people arent recognizing it.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the Expected Deaths for any particular week, the CDC looks at how many people died in that week over the past 5 years ... and averages that.</p>
<p>Do you see the issue?</p>
<p>Here are a sequence of numbers ..</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .....</p>
<p>What is the next number in the sequence?  6, right?</p>
<p>What if I tell you that I <em>expect</em> 3, because that what I got by averaging the past 5 numbers?</p>
<p>Now "6" seems too high.  It seems "excess". It's "3 too much". "WHY IS IT SO HIGH!?!"</p>
<p>The issue is that when you are looking at a steadily increasing number set, you dont make a good prediction for the next number by <em>averaging</em> the last 5 numbers.</p>
<p>So that is how the CDC calculates Excess Death, according to their site.  They average the last 5 years, and whatever is over that is "excess".</p>
<p>But if your number set was an ever increasing sequence, that is going to be too low.</p>
<p>It's possible that Excess Deaths stat could be useful for something.  But I dont think we are using it in the way it should be used, and I think we are reading something there that we shouldnt.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure that makes any difference in my point.  Like .. lets look at this line - </p>
<p>&rt;The data is in. Excess deaths for young people are over 25% higher than average, the highest increase for any age group.</p>
<p>Ok .. so at first glance the emotional response is predictable.  "OMG!  25% higher!".</p>
<p>But if the data looked like this .. </p>
<p>"Deaths for 18 - 44 range".<br>
2015 - 10000<br>
2016 - 20000<br>
2017 - 30000<br>
2018 - 40000<br>
2019 - 50000  </p>
<p>And then 2020 comes and we have 60000 deaths for 18 - 44 age .. what can we say?</p>
<p>Looked at one way, 60000 is "expected".  It's the natural continuation of the trend.</p>
<p>But when we average the past years we get 30000.  And 60000 seems "too high".  It's "Excess Deaths".</p>
<p>So I just see that as an issue no matter how you divide up the demographics.</p>
<p>Averaging the past 5 years is not a good way to establish what things "should" be this year.</p>

        <p>If it were predictable the increase would be similar across age sets.  I'm also having trouble finding that excess deaths increase year upon year. Looking over the technical information with the death count I found this in the 'limitations' section.
&rt;For example, provisional data on deaths among younger age groups is typically less complete than among older age groups. Predicted counts may therefore be too low among the younger age groups.</p>
<p>When I read that excess deaths were so high in younger people, higher than in older people, even those who have died numerously to Corvid, I saw this as an accurate set of data. We know that Crowvid doesn't kill young people in any large numbers, we know dog attacks and car accidents are much more dangerous to young people. What the government is having an impossible time doing is measuring the 'deaths of despair' caused by coronavirus restrictions. In my state of Maine it is my understanding (based on a radio interview of a drug addiction/recovery advocate) that they are not performing autopsies as they traditionally would have 'pre-pandemic', which means that one of the most common causes of death is not being counted normally.</p>
<p>There is also a culture of callousness towards young people now. Putting masks on young students 8 hours a day, forcing students to take medical tests and socially isolate to attend college, and telling young people not to have sex with each other, or sing or travel! It's grotesque! Of course this robbery of humanity from young people is going to cause an increase in 'deaths of despair'.
If you can show me that every year excess deaths in young people increase 25% then, you may have some credence to your argument. However, just like a humanitarian crisis was inevitable with the invasion of Iraq, a humanitarian crisis is inevitable with social distancing, with the biggest sacrifice of life being young people. And as the 'supply chain shortages' and 'travel blockades' continue to wreak havoc on food and medical aid around the world these statistics that show the victims of covid aren't grandmas, but families struggling to eat and survive. Young People.</p>
