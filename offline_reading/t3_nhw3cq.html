    <strong>It blows my mind there are people that have not gone back to work in person or left their house this entire time.</strong>
    <p><p>My state locked down for a couple months and then I was back at it, at a spa of all places, and have been working ever since. Close contact, tons of guests, not once this entire "pandemic" have I gotten sick or had a Q Tip shoved up my nose. Not one test, not one moment of quarantine, I have gone to bars, I have gone to the grocery store, I have gone to work. Other than a face mask my life never changed. </p>
<p>There are people put there who really think assimilating back into the world is going to kill them or others, yet there are so many people who basically never sheltered, sanitized, etc whose life didn't change an ounce. The only difference is dealing with angrier, shittier customers who don't have the emotional intelligence to process their feelings and take them out on employees like target practice. </p>
<p>How do these people really lie to themselves that thoroughly? To tell yourself if you walk outside you are a murderer or you are going to die? Is it the feeling of importance? The illusion of a fragment of control? How can you ALLOW your fight or flight system to take over your entire life? Or maybe mine has been working this whole time and I just always picked "fight". </p>
<p>I am genuinely worried about the emotional instability people are letting themselves fall into. Your mind is a tool, and it needs to be used, sharpened, and worked. These people let their brain cells fall out of their head eating take-out and watching Netflix. And they really blame the world and not themselves for being lazy slugs living off of state welfare. That's the thing about accepting charity, is it stops flowing at one point. These people are going to be socially deprived, controlling lunatics and a literal threat to others. We already see it. </p>
<p>Does anyone else feel completely mentally separated from this part of the population? I literally feel like I am living in a different world/reality compared to them. How do we come together as a community again when half of it thinks we are blood thirsty murderers and not the governements who took away their jobs, mental health, hobbies, and free will? How do they really believe people just trying to exist, like people have for thousand sof years, are the bad guys and not the billionaires who let children starve?</p></p>

        <p>The beach is literally my favorite place. And it’s the least dangerous place to be for a virus. Sunlight, heat, humidity, and wind from the ocean would destroy any particles instantly. It’s insanity that anyone was afraid of being outdoors in nature during this</p>

        <p>&rt;<em>"How do these people really lie to themselves that thoroughly?"</em></p>
<p>Self-righteousness is a helluva drug. So many of these people are pathologically anti-social to begin with, then the "pandemic" comes along. Suddenly, they're being told that the very thing they do anyway is "heroic" and "saving lives." You think they're going to give up that ego boost willingly? That would require admitting that they <em>are</em> just loners with nothing to contribute to society, and that would mean they're not special little heroic snowflakes "fighting the good fight" (by doing absolutely nothing).</p>

        <p>The people in my blue town are saying that now they are going to lock down harder, because kids under 12 can't be vaccinated, and they're afraid for their young children now that the mask mandates are lifted. They are willingly putting themselves under lockdown again, for no good reason!! I have friends and family who haven't seen me in person for over a year, and now my refusal to get the vaccine is causing more issues. I never locked down either, not even during those first two weeks, and I've been to restaurants, live music shows, etc. </p>
<p>And yeah I do feel mentally separated from that part of the population. In my area the vaccine is highly political and it's mostly Democrats who are getting the vaccine. Until recently I was a Democrat too, and honestly I'm getting some enjoyment out of people trying to comprehend what has happened to me, since I don't usually talk politics publicly. Totally boggles their minds - hopefully makes them think.</p>

        <p>I feel nothing for them tbh.  These people’s self-righteous compliance is what caused these lockdowns; I personally blame them more for what’s happened than the government.  Governments are always evil; I expect nothing better, and couldn’t care less what their intentions are.  But when my fellow neighbour complies with evil; especially out of cowardice/false pride; then I get mad.  And I have called many friends out on this and lost friends over it.  Its been over a year and they’re still defending this shit even though everyone deep down knows it’s bs.  (I can tell most people just can’t handle the idea of going against the mainstream, so they make themselves agree with it.  They’re just pussies afraid of confrontation.). So I feel nothing for them when I find out they’re going to face consequences for their actions</p>

        <p>Same! I feel ya</p>
<p>I lived in Cali (moved out in Sept to a state that's more open). I see posts from my Cali friends and some NEVER went outside the whole year....maybe to their garden but that's it. They are now posting about going on for the first time and going to dinner for the first time. I'm shocked lol. I have friends in Florida and Texas that have been living their lives the whole time. In my new state, most of the people have been out and about. It's wild seeing friends from heavy blue states completely be indoctrinated....still.</p>
<p>It's honesty just sad and I don't know how we rectify it. It's just some people are wired differently. I have family still in Cali and they think I'm nuts (because I traveled on a airplane back in August). They are unfortunately very pro-gates and Fauci.</p>

        <p>It's only certain parts in Cali. </p>
<p>I haven't worn a mask since last summer and I only wore one once before that, when forced too.  Only had it demanded 3 times since the start of it all. McDonald's, a Starbucks, and an arcade. </p>
<p>Haven't been back to any of these since, and i have no desire to ever again.</p>

        <p>Yes, I feel you. I had a client suggest taking the "purple pill" (a Matrix reference). I'm completely unplugged from the programming, but I have to try and co-exist with people who aren't. I have no fear around the virus and I'm fighting the fear I have being around people who ARE afraid of it! I've just started some "purple pill" meditations &amp; visualizations to help me deal.  It's SO important we try and bridge the two worlds!</p>

        <p>I have been working from home for +- 8 months. I am not allowed to go to work. At some points during lockdown you would need a certificate from your employer stating you are essential and needed at work. Police would stop to check you. </p>
<p>They were also checking companies. Plenty of companies in my sector got checked, people that weren't essential enough were sent home, got a fine and the employer also a fine per person on the floor + another fine. </p>
<p>People are snitches... </p>
<p>I would love to go to work. So do most of my colleagues... </p>
<p>So many people have left the company during the last year, so many new ones started, new ones also left. I don't even know who my colleagues are anymore...</p>

        <p>Lol to be honest I like working from home. I saved money on gas, less miles and work on my truck. Didn’t have to deal with fucking idiots in the office or on the drive. I could step out on my back porch sling some lead and go back in and keep working. Now I’m just in the office with a bunch of loud ass idiots all day....lol sorry for the rant...</p>

        <p>I have always worked from home. WTF do I want to go in the office for?<br>
So I can use a crappy PC, sit in an uncomfortable chair, not have control over the heating/aircon, get distracted by people talking about irrelevant crap like what happened on love island last night while standing next to my desk. Driving there and back every day, including in ice and snow and winter darkness?  </p>
