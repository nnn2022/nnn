    <strong>Agnostic Gates wants Gov. Jay Inslee to institute unholy medical segregation in WA State Churches</strong>
    <p><p>It's bad enough that there are money whores all over this world who will do anything for a buck. We've seen it everywhere. Gates is throwing millions into protecting his vaccine investments through hiring models, celebrities, actors etc to barrage us on every social media platform and legacy media to TAKE THE SHOT! Now he's calling in favors and getting Governors to do even dumber things to protect his investment.</p>
<p>I guess you could say its a "sin" to do this. All over the country, plenty of of well-meaning and trusting people are being taken advantage of, whipped up initially by fear, now radicalized under the guise of altruism, and the thought that there is no way that the son [Bill Gates] of the President of Planned Parenthood would ever wish ill upon the human race. Even those promoting the shot on the best of intentions are doing so out of fear and ignorance. Christians are no exception.</p>
<p>The problem is, the demand for the shot is slowing down, way down. The science is in; it's a totally survivable and treatable disease that needs no experimental voodoo shot that comes with a giant blank piece of paper acting like a medical package insert! Maybe they put that phony medical package insert so that the people getting it could have a readily available surrender flag...I don't know. And nobody is scared anymore, and it's on an instinctual level. Sure we all will mask up but take that mask off to eat in public places, still nobody is getting sick. Every once in a while we will see someone still wracked with fear walking around in a bio-suit but they are in the minority, probably 1 in 10,000.</p>
<p>Enter Plan B - coercion and increased social pressure. Now come the thumb screws, and to Christians, a great irony. In the scriptures we read that the lambs (faithful devotees) and the goats (sinners) will be separated at the last great day of judgement. To think that a sanctuary, a chapel, a tent, a place of Spiritual gathering would willingly create a scene of the Judgement day for Bill Gates is heretical and abhorrent to even the weakest of Christians. Get the shot and you're a faithful devotee, disregard and your judgeful congregation will have every reason to validate their already slightly negative view of you. Oh it's a mess in the making and quite insidious. Voldemort would be proud of the mud-bloods being separate at Hogwarts. Will we ever learn?</p>
<p>Christians as a rule tend to find comfort in rule keeping, but instituting this overreaching psychological action will destroy churches as we know it. Some are very happy about this. Either way, hold on to your hats. It's about to get a lot worse unless we voice our unhappiness with their short sighted and entirely stupid ass thinking.</p>

        <p>My church has yet to reopen in person. If the jab is mandatory to go back, then I will not be going back until it isn't. Such a shame as it's the only parish I have ever known.</p>
