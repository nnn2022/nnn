    <strong>I think we should start asking for a recount of total number of covid deaths....</strong>
    <p><p>Interesting article. The writer uses information straight from the CDC and other similar organizations. </p>
<p>Be careful though, you might be called a right wing, white privileged, racist, anti-vaxxing supremacist, who reads articles from right wing, domestic terror supporting websites, if you try to show some people this piece. I don't give a shit what people call me, so it was a risk I was willing to take here.  And, a lot of what is written can't really be refuted. Protocols and methods for how the CDC and other organizations did things and counted shit were changed around the start of the pandemic. It's that simple. Nobody can say that didn't happen. </p>
<p>Some quotes from the piece:</p>
<p>"It turns out that, thanks to changes the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) made to its rules, along with Congressional incentives, America’s COVID-19 counts are almost certainly inaccurate."</p>
<p>"According to the CDC, only 6% of those who died with the COVID-19 infection had no other pre-existing health conditions. The other 94% had an average of four medical conditions already affecting their health."</p>
<p>"If we counted each death that tested positive for flu or had symptoms of flu as an “influenza death,” we would also have hundreds of thousands of flu deaths each year."</p>
<p>"According to an October study from the bulletin of Science, Public Health Policy, and the Law, on March 24, 2020, the CDC changed the way it tabulated deaths for the previous 17 years, resulting in inflated COVID-19 death numbers."</p>
<p>"it appears the CDC acted without peer review and oversight by either the Office of Management and Budget or Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which would violate federal law."</p>
<p>"The same article says that, in August, the estimate for COVID-19 deaths under the new system was 161,392. However, if the same data had been tabulated under the old system, the COVID-19 death count would be only 9,684. The fundamental difference was that, no matter the patient’s ultimate cause of death, the new system mandated that COVID-19 must always be the first cause of death, with the other conditions listed as “contributing factors” – the opposite of the old system."</p>
<p>"The CDC created a new category of death from pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 to lump those causes together. This only created confusion about COVID-19 deaths."</p>
<p>"In addition to new ways of counting cases and financial incentives for listing cases, some states have been found to have irregularities in their COVID-19 death count."</p>
<p>"Using different rules for COVID-19 deaths versus deaths from other infections makes it hard to compare its mortality rates to those in previous pandemics or deaths from other infectious diseases, such as the flu."</p>
<p>Take from this what you will. Sadly, share with caution. Not because the information is inaccurate or because it comes from a bad source, but because it's not the story our esteemed public servants, medical professionals and journalists have been telling us for the last year or so. </p>

        <p>Like I said to someone else, what bothers me most is, we will never know the actual number. I don't care about proving anyone wrong or being right. I don't want to be able to head over to the ronavirus sub and stick it up their asses, I just want to know the truth. I want to know how many, if anyone, actually died from something that was used to flip our lives upside down, so much so, we may never recover. Not in our lifetimes at least. We are going to be affected by this moment in time for a long damn time. It was used to change everything. I just want to know how badly millions of people actually got played.</p>

        <p>It's probably a few 100. The same people that die from just thinking about eating a peanut.
Them so immune compromised and hyper allergic kids, that I remember from the 80-90s had to live inside a plastic bubble at home.
THEY die from Covid.
But THEY also die from a butterfly fart.</p>
<p>They should stay in their bubble! (Pun intended)</p>

        <p>I would be willing to bet that it's probably close to the same number of flu deaths that happen every year. Maybe even less because there has to be some actual flu deaths mixed in there. Problem is, we'll never really know and that's what fucking bothers me the most.</p>

        <p>It's pretty disturbing that we have to question what our national health organizations and medical professionals say. I can't believe how many doctors and scientist and other similar people are repeating shit they have to know is garbage. I mean, what happens if or when a true pandemic comes along? What happens when we're faced with a true global killer? It will be impossible to know what's fact and what's fiction after what they have done with this. </p>
<p>And, I don't think we will see large groups of people figuring shit out. I think the lines are drawn. No amount of new info or proof is going to convince the terrified. They want to stay scared. Anything short of Fauci or whoever having a press conference, where he tells everyone it's all been a con and it was intentional and it was all a lie, isn't going to convince the millions of scared and masked believers. Hell, I don't even know if a press conference would change anything. They would just say Fauci and friends are racist right wingers who can't be trusted.</p>
