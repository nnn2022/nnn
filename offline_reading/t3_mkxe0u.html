    <strong>Will life insurance pay out if someone dies from the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>I was wondering. My wife and I both had COVID last March. I was hospitalized for 11 days with pneumonia; she was sick at home. We both recovered, but she's terrified of getting it again, as unlikely as that seems, and intends to rush out and grab the shot as soon as it's available. I can't convince her otherwise, despite all the good info y'all have posted here. (Edit: She's recently tested as having a higher antibody level than last year after her recovery.)</p>
<p>What I can do, however, is make sure she's properly insured. We neither of us have life insurance at the moment, other than a paid-up membership in a burial society which will provide us with funeral expenses and a burial plot if we need one (which we don't, the family already owns several). I came pretty damn close to dying last year, and from my hospital bed I arranged matters such that the finances wouldn't be in a total mess if I kicked the bucket (gave trusted people passwords to financial stuff, etc.),  but if I had died, there would have been problems paying off the mortgage: we need both of our incomes to make that, and she'd have had to sell the house and move to a smaller place.</p>
<p>So before anything else happens, we'd like to maybe get some insurance to at least pay off the mortgage if either of us go away. </p>
<p>What concerns me, though, is that if she takes the shot and becomes permanently disabled or (God forbid) dies, that the insurer will use the experimental status of the "vaccine" as an excuse not to pay off. Given that insurance companies' entire business model is based on collecting as much in premiums as possible while paying out as little in benefits as they can get away with, I wouldn't put it past them to deny coverage. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the official narrative is that they're "safe", and that any deaths resulting therefrom are purely coincidental and attributed to other things, they might not be able to make that story stick.</p>
<p>What say you? Have there been cases of life insurance policies refusing to pay off in case of vaccine-related disability or death?</p></p>

        <p>I asked my LIFE INSURANCE GUY this question. He still hasn’t gotten back to me with a solid answer.</p>
<p>Update: He said this question ‘threw him for a loop’ he asked his supervisors who also didn’t know. All he said was, ‘As a life insurance firm they haven’t had any updated information from the state of NY that would make them believe otherwise.’</p>
<p>I’m still not sure what that actually means.</p>

        <p>Wife here, and there is no effing way I'm taking their "vaccine"</p>
<p>I'm also an insurance agent though and would just tell you that it will be nearly <strong>impossible</strong>to link the vax to any negative health outcome, as theyre already doing it now.  Plus, they usually pay for suicide after 2 years, so I doubt they can be very picky on covid vax claims.</p>
<p>Ins companies could just as likely discriminate against u if you <strong>dont</strong> get the vax, as well.  I'm sure that day is coming...</p>
<p>I'd go ahead and get the coverage and read with a fine tooth comb. You can always cancel it.  As well as look into a LTC policy or disability coverage thru work or on your own.</p>

        <p>If health insurance pays now, I don't think they are going to pay come the future. These injuries from these shots is going to be insane. Eventually the MSM and government won't be able to cover up the injuries associated with shots and the first companies to stop paying out will be insurance companies.</p>
<p>And I am not sure how it is in the US but in Canada, you cannot sue for injuries for these vaccines, they are completely protected from liability for Covid shots.</p>

        <p>It occurs to me that <em>we</em> can’t sue, but if enough insurers have to pay enough claims, maybe <em>they</em> can find a way. They’ve got more lawyers than we do.</p>

        <p>No a life insurance policy won't cover it, but for the same reason it won't cover death if you die drinking soda. </p>
<p>Anyway, what price policy would you like? I'd be willing to bet the vaccine doesn't permanently disable her or kill her or god forbid give her pneumonia that hospitalizes for 11 days. Anyway I'm willing to bet on this because selling a life insurance policy on this would be illegal. It's a good safety net for you. We can do monthly payments with the bet to make it similar to a life insurance policy, but again, it's gotta be a bet. Let me know your price, thanks!</p>

        <p>Wait.  You almost died from covid but you're worried about dying from the vaccine? EVEN if the less than 1000 died due to the vaccine (they didn't) that means that 1000 out of 56 million that have been vaccinated would be 0.00001%. that means 99.99998% do not die.  Isn't that the argument that 99% survive covid so it isn't a big deal yet 99.99 is a big deal??</p>
