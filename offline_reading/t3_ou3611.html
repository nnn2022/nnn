    <strong>A better way to respond to ban messages, if you respond at all.</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen a lot of posts about a user getting banned from another subreddit, and I notice that they often contain very angry and heated responses to the mods that issued the ban. I think this only serves to widen the gap between us and validate their view that we are the bad guys. I was banned from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aww">r/aww</a> today and decided that I would respond in a different way, simply replying with:</p>
<p>&rt;I only wish to think freely and form my own opinions. I bear you no ill will and sincerely hope that you are never censored for your personal beliefs, no matter what they may be!</p>
<p>If the mods of other subs saw more civil and human responses to bans, they may view us in a more positive light and be more willing to listen to us. It's not going to convert anyone on the spot, but they see enough hate every day without getting it from us. We should show them that we're better than that!</p>
<p>In most cases, I really think that it's best to not respond to the ban at all, but on the occasion that you do decide to respond, I want to encourage you to consider how it will affect the way the recipient views people like us. Calm civility is a much more constructive way to talk with these people than anger is.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks, u/BomTomdabillo!</p>
<p>I hope rational discourse  shall prevail however over time on this sub I have come to realize that so many out there have no interest in coming to the table since their only goal is our disbandment.   In other words, anything we say or do can be used unfairly by the court of public opinion so proceed with caution realizing this fact.</p>

        <p>Actually I sent a very polite message to one of the subs that banned me and I asked why I was banned, as I've never trolled another sub and haven't ever posted to their sub.  They muted me.</p>
<p>This is what I sent:</p>
<p>Why was I banned from this sub? I've never participated in it. Also, I've never brigaded or trolled another sub before. I understand we may have other views on things, but that doesn't mean we don't have things in common. I can understand banning people that troll your sub and it's yours to do as you wish, but blanket banning means you may miss out on some truly positive content and interaction. Not everything needs to be political.</p>

        <p>Sure.  I didn't have particular account in mind.  The fact that you had to lay out the reasons why you aren't a problem in particular is the reason we don't want to get involved as we don't have time to look into every incident like this.</p>

        <p>Good advice. I wish to have more patience and understanding of circumstances we're living in. I'm banned on seven subreddits and I really was tempted to write something back, but decided to hold it.</p>
