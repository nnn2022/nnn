    <strong>Dying from Heatstroke is apparently better than dying from COVID?!</strong>
    <p><p>On Saturday, August 15, my daughter's Karate class held a seven-hour Promotion at a public park in the California desert. The event was from 10am-3pm. The temperature at 10am was 106 degrees, and by 3pm it had climbed to 117 degrees. The state of California bans all outdoor exercise after the temperature exceeds 105 degrees. In addition, The air quality that day was listed as Poor (i.e., lots of smog).</p>
<p>On that same day, around the same time,  <a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/08/18/shane-thomas-soccer-star-death-palisades/">a young man died</a> from heatstroke in a community about 60 miles west of us, where the temperature was about 111 degrees.</p>
<p>During this seven hour Promotion, the students did a three-mile run, an additional thirty-minute workout, and then sat in the hot sun (no shade), without hats or water breaks for four hours while each student took turns doing Kata for their teachers. After the Kata performances, the students were required to continue doing aerobic exercises in the sun while the teachers sat in the shade for an hour discussing which of the students had earned Promotions this year. (Spoiler alert - it's a belt-mill; all of the kids earned Promotions).</p>
<p>The first student collapsed right after the three-mile run. He was related to the teachers, and even though he was 100% immobile for two hours, his parents and the teachers refused to call 911. The second student collapsed while sitting in the hot sun waiting for his turn. He recovered after spending thirty minutes in the shade.</p>
<p>Watching these kids collapse from heat exhaustion while the teachers and parents did nothing pretty much scared me to death. I dragged my daughter into our car and we sat in the air conditioning for awhile so she could recover from the heat exhaustion that was starting to affect her as well. Finally, the Promotion ended and my daughter told her teacher that she would no longer be a student at his school. He came at me as I was getting into my car and demanded to know why we were leaving his Karate school:</p>
<p>Teacher: What is your problem? Why are you pulling her out of my school?</p>
<p>Me: This Promotion was incredibly unsafe, and  it didn't even have to happen this way. You could have canceled it due to poor air quality/weather conditions, as you were violating California state law, or you could have used the air-conditioned venue I had arranged for your school to use free of charge (I have some good connections to gyms and indoor exercise spaces).</p>
<p>Teacher: Indoor exercise will spread the virus!</p>
<p>Me: This space is being used by other Karate schools with no problems. It's sanitized regularly, and it's really large, so social distancing would not have been a problem. Plus our county has authorized the use of indoor exercise spaces for no-contact sports... like Karate without sparring, which is what you just illegally did for seven hours in 117 degree heat.</p>
<p>Teacher: The other parents would have never agreed to any indoor space! They're all super scared of COVID!!</p>
<p>Me: Well, I just watched two kids collapse from heat exhaustion. So I'd say that your plan for dealing with paranoid parents just put the lives of twenty children at risk. If you were that concerned for your students' safety, you should have canceled the Promotion altogether.</p>
<p>Teacher: But... mah small business! If I cancel I get no money!</p>
<p>Me: Well your small business just lost another student. Goodbye.</p></p>

        <p>I can't remember which school said it, but they had rules that if there's a fire alarm, you need to shelter in place. I believe they got chewed out for that.</p>

        <p>That's borderline dangerous, if not already so. I'd get on the horn with whoever I had to to report the school to whoever could take action. That is a lawsuit and more just waiting to happen. They never just TRIED to ask parents about the situation they faced. Hell, they could have cancelled the classes or the excercises if they were that concerned, knowing the heat index and how dangerous that kind of heat can do. It could have killed a grown adult and caused heat stroke, let alone a kid. Anyone will tell you to not fuck around with the heat. And what if someone there DID have COVID? One of the symptoms they said from the beginning was a fever, and I can say from personal experience that being in the heat with a fever WILL fuck with you. That we all KNOW is deadly.</p>
<p>And if your kid, God forbid, DID die from the hear due to the arrogance of those jackoffs they were "teaching" them, their deaths might have been somehow linked by doctors to COVID because they want that bonus funding.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'd report their asses. NOW!</p>
