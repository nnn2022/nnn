        <p>thats not what they said. </p>
<p>they reported that hospitals are saying all the hospitalizations are unvaxxed ppl </p>
<p>they reported that vaxxed ppl can still contract the virus but data supports they arent getting as sick. they also reported that less than 1% of deaths are fully vaxxed people- which in my state is 151 so far. The CDC didnt call me at home so they must be reporting the same info everywhere </p>
<p>i mean get your story straight theres not enough information for you to be confusing any of it</p>

        <p>yes you are. Biden's job is to decrease vaccine hesitancy- if you're expecting him to be a scientist who knows everything you are confused. You would be no better in that task than he. Fauci never said the vaccine provided full immunity, and thats who professionally you should be listening to for as current information as possible. The fact that you even think its a matter of getting a story straight shows you lack the critical thinking skills to make these decisions on your own based off available information. sit down.</p>

        <p>Here is the back of a box math I did with it given the numbers. Unvaccinated cases totaled 121,402, with 2,337 cases at or above age 50.  twice Vaccinated cases totaled 28,773 with 13,427 cases at or above age 50. Let’s just focus on the fully two shot vaccinated versus unvaccinated.</p>
<p>I think it’s fair to focus on the really bad outcomes, so I divided the outcomes for overnight hospitalization and death within 28 days by the relevant population and got the overall and over 50 risk. </p>
<p>Vaccinated chance of having to be kept in hospital is 0.029 overall and 0.05 if advanced in years. Chance of death is 0.007785 overall and 0.016 if at or above 50.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated would be overnights at 0.018 overall and 0.18 if at or above 50. Chance of death looks to be 0.001359 overall and 0.056 if at or above 50.</p>
<p>But, then again, what do I know?</p>

        <p>not everyone knows how to read statistics</p>
<p>happy to help: an 18 paragraph guide to stats</p>
<p>statistics provide opportunities for comparison in search of patterns. the most you can read from them narrows down a field of inquiry. You might eliminate a possibility based on statistics, but it has to be SEVERAL statistics. stats really mean nothing on their own it is only in collaboration with others that 'directions' might be suggested but not necessarily conclusions drawn- as the fluctuation in data proves and disproves and creates new possibilities. </p>
<p>If we were to look at just 'covid cases' that tells us very little- to nothing. First, the cases only represent documentation. Its impossible to draw that actual number because health services in the US are largely inaccessible. Even those that are aren't necessarily efficiently reporting or testing or diagnosing. So its only a supposition its barely a statistic. 
If we add covid deaths--- there we have a more solid number because deaths are not largely unreported and coroners make far fewer mistakes than doctors do because theyre able to fully examine internal tissues. 
These two numbers together tell us THAT it is happening, that a percentage results in fatality, but little else, and they are inaccurate to depict the scale.
So a third stat: economic growth, and a fourth stat: unemployment claims, help to determine the scale effect better than the first two numbers alone. a picture forms, but fuzzy. people seem to be catching it. everywhere.
then a fifth stat becomes vaccine hesitency,
a sixth -the total number of shots administered nationwide beside the seventh- total populations by age group. we see who its hitting and how. 
Then they divided reported covid cases by age, by gender, by state, by variant. 
Each new piece lends shape to the pandemic</p>
<p>But the next stats come from the success rates of other vaccines. the comparison/ criticism of the speed of development- although its kind of ridiculous to overlook that the entire world was doing this simultaneously- thats certainly not how any other vaccine has ever been developed. This is unprecedented- a first- so that comparison (which is already ignoring decades of scientific advances ) does not make sense.</p>
<p>Only 3 vaccines have had 100% effectiveness. Smallpox, Polio, and Diptheria. But the least effective vaccine- pneumococcal disease- had a 74% success rate which is still a really promising number and worth that amount of protection. </p>
<p>Those numbers alone are solid- you can draw several possible conclusions from them; that vaccines have saved lives from terrible disease. They radically advanced our species. </p>
<p>The next infuencing stat is anti vaxxers- which doesnt have to be a number so much as an influence on a previous stat- hesitancy.</p>
<p>hesitancy is initially understandable due to the unprecedented nature covid has had. The rapid development is both inspiring and frightening-- although it actually wasnt that fast. They told us once the virus was isolated they have a process-- but it takes a year minimum (partially to account for some steps sometimes needing repeating for various reasons) but not necessarily more than a year either. Now look- there's several vaccines, and from that stat you can draw the conclusion that different companies did not help each other (even though i think they should have). Instead of the global common good, everyone chose capitalism- knowing that if they were the first to succeed it would be worth something on some level. Their own lives, their family, their country::</p>
<p>Now the completion time is a stat too. Some of them did it in the year- probably no time was wasted. The extra time it took for others to complete essentially the same process and the differences between the times are more stats. It gives hesitancy most of its little credibility. Its a matter of trust- and the last 18 months have not inspired trust in perhaps the most uncertain world any of us have seen. Look how much people were obsessed with blame over seeking any type of salvation. </p>
<p>But examine further stats--case numbers going down but everyone notices testing is going down too. the resources are being pulled back. That makes all further stats nullified- because now they aren't even a random sampling of the population. All the stats after enter a free rise/fall- where it is safe to assume they are much higher than reported. That happened because resources were pulled back-- in hopes that the unreported numbers would discourage fear and we did not fail to see the resources pulled back.</p>
<p>If there is a scandal here it is not a microchip in a vaccine (which would take longer than a year to create -we have a chip shortage), it is the manipulation of the public's perception of vaccines as a smokescreen for what should be outrage at the governments pulling resources back in a pandemic that no statistic yet has indicated is over. </p>
<p>nothing and no one else is offering us any other protection besides getting covid- (which, presuming you survive, will give you antibodies which provide some protection). We dont like ultimatums, and there we are with an awful one.</p>
<p>the next stats - vaxxed covid cases- definitely suggest  you can still get infected. The picture, which had become somewhat clear, clouds. hesitancy naturally is further fueled.</p>
<p>Now we have variants: a whole new group of stats putting the others into perspective-- even as the picture gets bigger and more complicated- its a little clearer in scope.
What does that instantly indicate? That this is far from over? that the virus will continue to mutate? Apparently scientists continue to study the variants but we have already seen how long one takes to cross the world, and watched the more recent ravage other countries. You can draw the conclusion from those stats and world news that any variant we hear about will be here soon enough. </p>
<p>That has repeatedly proven true. I think i can draw the conclusion that more waves are coming and that its pretty reckless not to take the only option I appear to have. </p>
<p>An interesting stat--The tiniest islands in the world- with no visitors- all still reported at least 1  covid case. Just think about that stat. I also think there will end up being a booster-- because the virus continues to evolve and our immune systems might need further help to do the same. this might hammer the earth for years. this might still only be round one.</p>
<p>Even thinking this way it was still not completely clear until i got pneumonia in spring. drs all thought it was covid but they quickly ruled that out (6 tests later). it took several tests/scans to figure out what was wrong by process of elimination one stat at a time. Medicine is when I can believe the most in reading stats- because we know exactly what we're not looking at so quickly. </p>
<p>In the hospital i often could hear weird muffled screams-- which i was told were coming from intubated covid patients in the ID ward. I got pretty anxious hearing screams for weeks. It sounded like the trial by stone from The Dark Crystal. Seriously. I don't know how active your imagination is- but I couldnt handle being intubated. I would completely lose my mind too. So. I would get a stupid shot or two if it meant that could hopefully never happen to me. I need to be able to breathe.</p>
<p>And god bless those nurses. they seemed upset. they said i was the only patient on that floor who could speak. i heard there was a patient going nuts flinging his poop at them. I didnt know nurses had to deal with shit like that.</p>

        <p>My takeaway from the stats is that there is little real risk posed by COVID 19 unless one is of advanced age or, more importantly, has several comorbidities. </p>
<p>Many of the numbers presented to the public are cooked, or presented with extreme slant. Hence the shifting emphasis between cases (positive tests), hospitalizations, and deaths (which were really more deaths With COVID than From COVID). CDC admits as much when their own data indicates that some 5% of their COVID deaths were without other comorbidities.</p>
<p>The new “vaccines” are meant to reduce an already small chance of bad reaction to COVID, but present a new risk of side effects greater than traditional vaccines (boy, are the narrative shapers dancing around that last bit). They are new, experimental substances, and anybody telling you they KNoW the long term effects or efficacy of The mRNA vaccines is lying.</p>
<p>Respirators are dumb, panicky treatment options that present difficult roads to recovery under the best of circumstances. They appear to be used because therapeutic treatment (the go to move for viruses, by the way) was left largely ignored. Hence the bru ha ha over hydroxychloriquine, remdesivir, and especially now Ivermectin. </p>
<p>Short version: chances the ‘rona will take you down 6ft are small. Chances the state and international bodies are lying to you are high.</p>

        <p>no you are open to having things explained to you that you don't understand. You are open to a nonexistent 'short version'. you are open to making assumptions based on what you want to be true. You don't even understand how viruses are treated. vaccines are the "go to by the way" there is literally no such thing as a therapeutic treatment- thats literally all in your mind.</p>
<p>I have no responsibility to build a foundation for critical thinking that you lack, and neither does Biden or Fauci. none of us can fix your stupid. You're position is "person who should do as they're told" because there is likely nothing that can make you understand anything.</p>

        <p>There’s vaccines (which wouldn’t necessarily apply to the mRNA variety), and there’s treat the symptoms. That is virus care. Quibble if you must, but therapeutic treatment aptly describes the latter course of action.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of talk about my supposed shortcomings, but it wasn’t really an argument. Got anything else more persuasive?</p>

        <p>That’s not what the sheet says. Out of the total deaths, less then 10 were from those fully protected while majority (maybe not 90% numbers Nazi) were not vaccinated. Save existing factors that may increase morbidity factors this data proves nothing.</p>

        <p>Plus you want to remove the number of people with the antibody and the unlinked. Without tests that can be connected to people the number could be both wildly inflated or wildly deflated.</p>

        <p>Except that 224 is the lump total of the vaccinated in general. It’s a collection of the under 50 (which only made up 4) and over 50 (which made up the 220). Considering the common old persons disease which would be worsened by COVID (lung problems being the greatest due to the higher amount of lung damage in older American populations. Also assuming this trend is true in the UK. Given the prevalence of smoking I would be shocked if this was a wrong conclusion) and the fact the Delta variant is being spread primarily by younger populations that high number is not unorthodox. Especially in a country 10x more dense then the US. Plus, the Delta variant has evolved weakening current vaccine protection.</p>
<p>Ergo, do the math, use your brain, and stop cherry-picking the info you like while ignoring the others. The chart proves nothing other then what we’ve known for a while which is if you’re younger get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>That's clever. I called you a sheep so you called me one. That explains the inability to think for yourself and just believe the CDC is fully transparent.</p>
<p>But in case that's too high level, here's a reply more in line with your level of education: </p>
<p>so your saying my dad banged your mom while your dad was watching and willingly giving up his wool to those in authority? (There's a metaphor in there that maybe a friend can explain)</p>
