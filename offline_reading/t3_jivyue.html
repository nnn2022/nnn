    <strong>Rough comparisons of cases and deaths of countries per capita(Why low numbers will "catch up").</strong>
    <p><p>Back in August(August 26) I made some speculations that cases of countries with very low numbers will eventually play "catch up" with countries that have much higher numbers, such as United States. In some aspects same will be true with deaths as well.</p>
<p>Here's my data.</p>
<p><strong>Per million people</strong>(data from Worldometer)</p>
<p>The following paragraph summarizes the countries that showed <em>low number of cases per capita</em>(or population).</p>
<p>Spain went from 9K cases to 24K. France from 3.8K to 24.7K, India from 2.3K to 5.7K, Argentina from 7.9K to 24K, Belgium from 7.1K to 27K, Indonesia from 576 to 1432, Ukraine from 2.5K to 8K, Italy went from 4.3K to 9K, and Germany from 2.8K to 5.4K. Even Canada went from 3.3K to 5.8K.</p>
<p>You can see many of the quoted countries panicking recently.</p>
<p>Side note, because of the sheer number of people, I imagine India will be #1 in terms of cases and pass the US. It's past the peak for cases/deaths but it still has a lot of momentum.</p>
<p>As for death numbers, increase per capita for countries with high numbers such as US and Brazil increased by 30-40% since I gathered the data. That's different from places with low numbers such as India(43 to 86), Iran(167 to 391), Argentina(167 to 646), Indonesia(25 to 49), Ukraine(53 to 148), Philippines(28 to 64), Israel(93 to 267)</p>
<p><strong>Lockdown happy Peru which has been in the top 3 deaths per capita</strong> for a while had similar per capital case numbers as US at 18.4K versus 18K for the US. US is at 27K and Peru is slightly under 27K. That's with the US doing 3x the testing per capita.</p>
<p>Most of the countries stated above with multiple the increase in cases have quite high deaths per capita numbers. Therefore, the amount of increase in deaths are quite small(in the 25-40% range).</p>
<p>Now the disclaimer is that I didn't account for possible cultural differences(though that may be small), temperature and humidity differences due to geography, and lockdown measures. For example, Japanese and Korean numbers might be small because they are quite humid and get pretty hot in Summer, due to tiny lands surrounded by the sea. Viruses are very seasonal. Our behaviors are different as well. We engage in more healthy activities during Summer. Get more sun, get healthier, and the rays kill viruses too, etc. Or that many countries are in an worse economic state thus the population is younger.</p>
<p>As for data collection, its no easier than to just look at various states. New York is pretty much over in terms of death-waves because they suffered a lot in the beginning. US is also unique in that its a large country with many people living all over the area. It'll have its own waves due to some states in a decline in numbers and others, an increase.</p>
<p>Whichever way you look at it, viruses will do what viruses gotta do. It'll spread, whether it takes a long time to do so, or a short time. Lockdowns, masks, if they help at all, they don't really matter in the big picture.</p></p>

        <p>Everywhere in the world they are counting EVERYONE who died WITH the virus as a "covid death". If you fell from a cliff and you were an asymptomatic covid infectee, you are written down as a "covid victim". Plus, hospitals all around the world are receiving more funding when they report "covid victims". It's all a big scam.</p>

        <p>how dumb is it that they are 'testing' people for a common cold virus
 using a manufacturing technique?</p>
<p>how many people get a cold every year?</p>
<p>there is no vax or cure for the common cold. it is not deadly, if a cold kills you, then you weren't long for this world any way.</p>
<p>the rona ain't even the flu, it's a cold!</p>
