    <strong>I’M TOO FUCKING YOUNG FOR THIS SHIT</strong>
    <p><p>I’m only 21! I’m too fucking young for this! I have my whole fucking life ahead of me and there was so much I wanted to do in life ya’ll just have no idea! I can’t even put it into words. I’m way too young for this dystopian bullshit. I have been poor my whole life. I never got to travel, I only ever traveled out of my state a few times and it was just to another state and it was the same one every time. That’s it. There’s literally so much I wanted to do. I’m so fucking scared. I want to survive to old age and let nature take its course but that might not happen. I’m fucking crying. Everyone says life will never ever go back to normal and that this dystopian nightmare that I pray to God every day will end will only get worse. I can’t handle it. I’ve started developing alcoholism to cope. I can’t do this shit. I’m gonna fucking puke. I can’t sleep at night over this shit. I can’t enjoy food anymore. I just want to go out and LIVE! It’s a good thing that I live in an extremely red state so anti covid measures aren’t very strict here but there’s the bullshit with masks and social distancing. I just want to live, not exist! I want to travel to Japan, South Korea, Europe and the UK, etc. I want to do so much. I don’t know what to do. I have no hope anymore. And I thought last year was my most depressive year. I told myself on New Years this year that this was gonna finally be year, my decade! I was gonna finally actually make friends which I never really had in my teen years because of social anxiety. Fuck me! The NWO was not supposed happen in my lifetime or not until I was already really old but holy fuck here we are. I don’t want any this. Nobody deserves any of this! Nobody! God why is there such evil in this world. How can people be so heartless? I hate it here. Please take me away to live among the stars and the galaxies. I can’t handle this.</p></p>
