    <strong>pandemic of the unvaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>Now the german government is talking about the pandemic of the unvaccinated too. </p>
<p>This is to counter the argument that everyone who wants to protect himself can now take the vaccine and we can end all of this. </p>
<p>But now because of the unvaccinated, there will be new variants, and we can't end this until everyone is vaccinated.</p>
<p>Germanys "table" (food for the poor) now only gives food out for people with the pass before the government even put it in law. And when tests become chargeable, the poor either have to get vaccinated or don't get food from "table" anymore. </p>
<p>Meanwhile in france the greenpass started. Tests won't stay free for much longer, and it will be extended to children 12years and older. They want 100% of the kids vaccinated. </p>
<p>I don't know where they got the idea of 0 covid got from, but it's an impossibility. And that should be a nobrainer if you look at countries with high vaccination rate. Therefore the only reason for this hard measures are for getting as much vaccinated as possible, just for the sake of vaccination.</p></p>

        <p>That was kinda my question as well, why such a hard on to vaccinate everybody? And not just any covid shot,but at least here in north smerica, it's only the mrna and astra....</p>
<p>I know this type of speculations is what gets people who are not on board with this madness into trouble, but I'm this seems like a good place to ask that question</p>
