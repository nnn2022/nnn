        <p>TL;DR: Lockdowns will have a negative impact on COVID and flu infection rates and the solution is more lockdowns. Also, everybody loves the new normal.</p>
<p>&rt; England could face nationwide restrictions and very extensive local lockdowns in the event of a second wave of coronavirus this winter, the health secretary has warned.</p>
<p>&rt;Matt Hancock said that under a “reasonable worst-case scenario” Britain could find itself contending with a surge in coronavirus and a bad outbreak of seasonal flu as people spent more time indoors.
In an interview with The Times he said that a second wave of Covid-19 was “avoidable but it’s not easy” and that the return of children to schools next week presented challenges in stopping the spread.</p>
<p>&rt;”A second wave is clearly visible in other parts of the world,” he said. “It is a very serious threat. But so far in the UK we are managing to keep the number of new cases flat through a combination of test and trace and local lockdowns.” He added: “This is the reasonable worst-case scenario, that we have a bad flu and a growth in coronavirus as people spend more time indoors. Cases go up again, and we have to use very extensive local lockdowns or take further national action. We don’t rule that out but we don’t want to see it.”</p>
<p>&rt;The strong comments from a senior cabinet minister make clear that winter could bring a significant setback to progress against the pandemic. The prospect of national restrictions caused by a second wave will be of concern to business leaders and also to Britons who have got used to their increasing freedoms as lockdown has eased.</p>
<p>&rt;Under the initial lockdown, the retail and hospitality industries were forced to close across the country. Boris Johnson has previously compared the prospect of another nationwide lockdown to a “nuclear deterrent”. He said last month: “I certainly don’t want to use it. And nor do I think we will be in that position again.”</p>
<p>&rt;The prime minister said yesterday that schools would be closed again only as a last resort. He is expected to push again to get people back to work next month amid concerns that city centres are dying.
However, a survey by The Times has found that three quarters of Britain’s biggest employers are looking at a permanent shift to flexible working. Another survey of 1,500 parents found that most of them would refuse to send their children to school in the event of another lockdown.</p>
