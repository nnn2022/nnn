    <strong>The people that are still wearing mask in public look like anti vax people which is hilarious.</strong>
    <p><p>CDC just fucked their loyal cult.  Now they just look like fools.  I mean they always did but now they have to be feeling disoriented and powerless.  I been giving people very subtle confused looks today when I see them still masking. If they say anything.  I'll just ask if they don't trust the vaccine and say I'm vax and that mask spread bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>Big win for us.  However, we do take somewhat of a hit if we are in a fascist state.  Since our place of work, depending on where we work might be allowed to ask us to still mask if we aren't vaxxed.  Which is seriously fucked up.  Fuck Kate brown and Inslee. These fascist pieces of shit know mask don't matter and they don't care.  The stats have been out for over a year.</p></p>
