<p>If you look at the numbers there’s a decent chunk of middle age and young people who’ve died, and the permanent damage done to otherwise healthy people who survive is still something to watch out for.</p>

        <p>Reddit jokes about everything. At the time it wasn’t likely to become this widespread but due to people not quarantining and people refusing to wear a mask or social distance it has, and that people hundreds of thousands of people are dying we stopped making those jokes because we are decent human beings who just joke about small things.</p>

        <p>Why are you replying to this after three weeks? There were still jokes about it when it was widespread in China and Italy. And jokes aren't even my main point before this you could find posts suggesting old people be forced to retire, and generally just shitting on them, saying they can't wait until they're all gone ect. Look through those people's posts now and they're peak dormers because they're a hivemind</p>

I can't speak for everyone but this whole us vs then mentality that's manifested is because of your beloved Donald Trump and the simple minded values which you hold. If you back Trump you're a traitor to this country and I hope your lack of mask wearing stupidity has an effect on you as well, for the sheet fact that it would even the voting numbers. I'm a centrist btw. Not sure it matters.</p>

        <p>Anyone with half a brain understands that america was well and truly divided before the election. That's the whole reason he got elected.

        <p>Go and read about hitlers rise to power (not that trump is anywhere near hitlers level). Hitler was just a mouthpiece for the german people's frustration. Hitler didnt cause any divide (although he exacerbated it). He simply took advantage of people despair and hopelessness caused by major economic strain and a lack of unifying narrative. Trump's did the same. He simply took advantage of people's distrust of politicians who simply want to be elected so they can line their pockets with lobby money. For leftists hes also served as the enemy, similarly to how the jews where a scapegoat for hitler (not that the level of suffering is even on the same level). You can see this with the amount of projection he receives.</p>

        <p>Hispanics have it as bad as the jews under trump? Last I checked obama locked up more hispanics than any other president before him. Last I checked it was just as hard for me (White, G7 passport) to immigrate to the USA as it was for a Mexican and last I checked all my hispanic friends currently in the USA have jobs, homes and are free to do whatever they want within the law.</p>
<p>Now compairing trumps situation to the jews. He's persecuted in the sense that the jews were by the german fascists scapegoat in the 1930-40s. A chosen target where the ideological adherents could focus their misfortune without need for real critical thought (which usually includes a major admission of guilt personally a thus is often too difficult to make). In that sense yes trump is like the jews, albeit the persecution isn't as severe which I already said but I guess you choose to ignore that. Racism? Blame trump. covid? blame trump. Even though trumps policy doesn't reflect this in the slightest its just easier to blame it all on trump. </p>
<p>Most people (myself included as I'm in 3rd stem, with a GPA good enough for graduate school and have demonstrated I can do linear algebra and multivariate calculus) aren't retarded, they like you just haven't awoken from the delusion that is believing blinding what the government and the mass media tell you. letting go of falsehood is hard, probably because it means giving up safety, which is why most of you "wearing is caring" sheep are so defensive at the first suggestion that you shouldn't wear a mask. Just pure cowardice</p>

        <p>1 in 1600 Americans have died from COVID-19 over the past 6 months or so. More will needlessly die because people won’t follow the advice of experts. If everyone wore a mask in public, it would disappear in a matter of weeks, just like it has all over the world where people have listened to what the medical experts are saying we should do. It’s just selfish people like you that are continuing it.</p>
<p>I guess having a 9/11 death toll every day isn’t worth changing any aspect of your life in the slightest.</p>
<p>It could’ve been over already. But people like you refuse to listen. You think you know better than people who have spent their entire lives studying infectious diseases.</p>
<p>There’s a reason the U.S. has more deaths than any other country in the world. It’s you.</p>

<p>Do you even realize what you're saying? If we all wear masks, it will disappear in a few weeks? You of course are too fucking stupid to realize what that statement means.</p>
<p>Since you are incredibly stupid, I'll explain. If wearing masks is that effective, then hundreds of millions of people have died needlessly of diseases that spread this way over the last hundred years. And just this year, the medical experts figured out that masks can stop diseases like this. These experts must be as monumentally stupid as you are to have overlooked this simple thing for so long.</p>
<p>Or, it could be that masks don't "disappear" diseases and it's just you being amazingly fucking stupid and brainwashed.</p>

        <p>This isn't the first time people have worn masks during a deadly outbreak though? I mean yeah masks won't stop the spread of cancer but they would probably stop the spread of the common cold, the difference is the cold isn't deadly. What exactly are you trying to say?

<p>All of this is kind of a moot point because none of us are experts in virology or medicine, but they people that <em>are</em> experts disagree with you.</p>

        <p>Here in Montreal, everyone has been wearing masks in public since July and the cases are now at an all time high and rising rapidly.</p>
<p>It could have been over by now if everyone in the world had a strict lockdown for a long time, but that was never going to happen. Localized lockdowns or ones that don't last until the virus has been eliminated only delay the pandemic. There was never any possibility of this having been over by now.</p>
<p>The real question is, is this massive disruption to our lives that has been going on for seven months and will likely continue for the next year worth saving the 0.2% of the population that would have otherwise died and which has an average age of eighty and would have died a few years later anyway?</p>

        <p>I agree that's extremely hypocritical of the left. Political issues should be solved through a democratic process instead of relying on someone's misfortune. Wishing for a politician's death is low.
However I'd also like to point out that the top post in this sub says:</p>
<p>&rt; I'm tired of being told that everyone else's health is my responsibility all of a sudden meaning I have to stop living my life just because someone's obese diabetic grandma might get coronavirus. Some random stranger's health is not my job to worry about</p>
<p>Isn't it ironic? If anything the correct response from this place should be a cold stare followed by Ivan Drago's "If he dies, he dies".</p>

        <p>My behavior had no effect on the health of the POTUS.    Telling people that they have <strong>personal responsibility</strong> for their own health is not wishing them to die.   That's why you teach your kids to look both ways before crossing the street.</p>

        <p>He's not a random stranger, he's the President of the United states.  I'm pretty sure most of us here aren't all that concerned about his chances considering  he probably has the best medical staff making sure he recovers without a hitch. The point of this post is to mock the hypocrisy of those preaching compassion and empathy, who then turn around and wish death on someone because they don't agree with his politics.</p>

<p>Some people are wishing death on him and I don’t agree with that at all but I’m amused that his foolishness came back to bite him in the ass. And of course, Trump supporters are asking for compassion when you told us to get bent when talking about wearing a mask to help keep others safe.</p>

        <p>Sweet,go ahead and wear your bacteria stained cloth over your face and delude yourself into thinking you're helping.  Just stop trying to force everyone around you to act as paranoid as you . </p>
<p>As for vaccines, They were certainly useful when they first came out for shit like polio. Nowadays, people are getting shots for the flu each year and a select few still catch it. And as for the COVID vaccine, no way in hell I'm going to take any medicine that was rushed out in a few months without proper testing, all to protect me from a virus with a 99+% survival rate.</p>

<p>Well, Covid-19 is a novel (new) virus so why would you think a vaccine wouldn’t be helpful? Nothing is 100% except for death. So, I guess you should just sit inside your house because nothing in life is 100%. No medication or anything you ingest or inject or use is 100% safe. This isn’t anything new. People are being asked to do the bare minimum to help one another out.</p>

        <p>You're right,nothing is 100% except for death. Death is coming for us one day no matter what. So some of us decide we would rather enjoy our lives rather than croak choking on some takeout while hoping the government will tell us when it's 'safe'. The high majority of us have probably already caught Covid at some point and never even knew about it, and it's not going to just up and vanish,so why even play along with this political theatre,because that is all this lockdown and mask shit is.</p>

        <p>Who is croaking on take out? What does that have to do with the conversation? If there were effective treatments, I would agree that we could relax a bit but the problem is, we don’t. And anyone who thinks it’s going to vanish one day is just being naive. It’s been six weeks now since my mother and brother cane down ill and they will both tell you, it’s not like catching a cold, it’s not the flu. I was legit scared for my mother. Everyone I know that has health issues have been doing what they can to keep themselves safe, which for the most part means staying home but it’s not an option to stay home for everything. Why is it so difficult for others to just have some common decency?</p>

        <p>You people are the ones who find it difficult to have common decency.Yes, some people are going to catch it and some of those people will have a pretty bad time of it.As some have probably already stated,anyone who feels they are at risk should stay home,maybe have a friend or relative pick stuff up if necessary. As the months have passed,it should have become clear that lockdowns were a horrible idea. We still have 200k deaths(Lower than that if we account for the fact that hospitals have been caught inflating the numbers for money) and yet we have millions of Americans out of work,spent trillions of dollars trying to keep the economy from collapsing due to businesses shutting down and jobs evaporating(which I guarantee will have its consequences later on down the line) and forcing the majority of a perfectly healthy population to live in misery,treated like walking plagues by paranoid doomers. Now tell me,is saving the lives of people at risk of dying for just about anything for a couple of months really worth all of this? Because the longer this drags,the more people realize how excessive this reaction was and the harder it is for people still drinking the koolaid to justify this.</p>

        <p>You people? And you have obviously didn’t read my comment very well when I told you that people I know have restricted their trips out to the absolute bare essentials. Perhaps, in the beginning, we could have had a complete shutdown and we wouldn’t be in this spot right now. It’s pretty cavalier of you to say you’re willing to risk lives when it’s not your life and maybe your immediate family’s life on the line. Maybe, just maybe, if we had a competent government in place we could have moved past this by now. But, that chance was blown away several months ago. So now, you’re asking people who are taking as many precautions as possible to keep themselves safe to offer themselves as sacrificial lambs when we can’t even get the general public to agree to wear masks in public to try to make this shit go away. I certainly am not putting blame on the people doing everything in their control to not die as the problem. That would absolutely fall on people who can’t do the bare minimum to help get things back on track. The reason why society is shut down is because of you and people like you so start pointing the finger at yourself.</p>

        <p>I have no intention of risking lives,I just see the absolute lunacy in expecting the entire world to throw itself into a financial crisis just so a select few can pretend that they are safe. And if I myself were at a proper risk,I would probably say the same things I'm saying now,because I am capable of thinking past myself and looking at the big picture.</p>
<p>I will tell you right now that you are wasting your time.You will never convert anyone here into believing this is some apocalypse that everyone needs to cower in fear from because we've seen behind the curtain.Masks are not going to make this shit go away,because A. the virus is not going to just vanish in thin air and B. Masks don't work period. There's still some debate as to whether actual N95 masks will help prevent transmission,to say even less about the shitty little cloth you all throw on like that will do something. The ruling class of the government themselves know this isn't a big deal,how many times have we heard of politicians breaking the very rules they impose on us. They are looking at obedient little sheep like you and they are laughing at you!</p>

        <p>Nah, just tired of talking to a brick wall. You know, funny how things have worked out well for the rest of the world who social distance and wear masks and they are up and running again but here we are with people like you who think there’s a global conspiracy against Trump that the entire rest of the world is in on. Somehow, getting the rest of the world to follow a false narrative is somehow real instead of accepting that we need to wear masks and stay home to make things better. It must be a wild ride in your mind with the boogey man stories you come up with. Somehow, you’re “woke” because the Cheeto in the White House needs to pander to the fatally stupid in this country because he knows that people like you are the only ones he can continue to con about how he’s done great leader. So go ahead and continue “to own the libs” and hope fate misses you. Tootles!</p>

        <p>So you think 100% mask usage would 100% eliminate transmission of the virus? What evidence do you have for this? Even the few mask studies that have been done show masks dont stop transmission completely, although there is slight evidence that they may reduce transmission.</p>

        <p>I never said they were 100% effective, and there is more than slight evidence that they reduce transmission, especially if you use an N95 or similar face covering. 
Also, just to clarify my meaning, I'm not saying a surgical mask will protect the wearer, what it does is protect others from a wearer who is infected but may not know it.
If you want a link, here's one: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-mask/art-20485449</p>
<p>And as far as masks protecting other from droplets, there are plenty of videos on YouTube demonstrating how our droplets spread when our mouths aren't covered.</p>

        <p>So if they aren't 100% effective, then there is no guarantee that Trump wouldn't have got ill if he had worn a mask, which is what the OP said.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The link you have given me is not a scientific study, it is a parrot of government and WHO recommendations (which have changed many times from one position to the polar opposite). There are actually no scientific studies that show irrefutably that face masks significantly reduce the spread of this virus in everyday scenarios. If you have any, then please share as I would like to look at them.</p>
<p>EDIT : Oh, and you say that we wear masks to protect others, to stop us from spreading it. So:</p>
<p>1) Why would wearing a mask have stopped Trump getting ill then?</p>
<p>2) How, in your mind, does a piece of cloth stop transmission of a virus one way, but not the other? Again, have you got any studies you can point me to?</p>

        <p>I never said they were 100% effective I said if he and other people around him had worn masks it would have helped his chances.</p>
<p>And as far as your points about masks, it's not my job to explain that to you, look it up. Just type "how do masks stop the spread of covid" into google. I can't provide irrefutable evidence because irrefutable evidence dosen't exist. Show me irrefutable evidence the earth is round.
Oh and yeah the WHO changed their stance, in science that's called learning and progress not failure, do you not wash you hands because doctors used to say it didn't do anything?</p>

        <p>It is up to you to provide the evidence. You are the one saying we need to change our way of life. You need to provide the evidence of why we should do this, the burden of proof is on you.</p>
<p>I have searched, i have read several papers and havent found anything that supports the use of masks to a reasonable degree. So  if it's so obvious, show me a scientific study that supports the use of masks.</p>
<p>EDIT : yes, you're right that nothing can be proven to an absolute degree. So i have said 'reasonable' above, i guess that could be considered as a consensus</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting this :) Some parts of this look persuasive, whilst others not so.</p>
<p>For example, in 4. Mask Efficacy Studies (which I would say was the most relevant section?) we have the following:</p>
<p>"No randomised controlled trials have been conducted for SARS-CoV-2, although a number of studies have attempted to indirectly estimate the effect."</p>
<p>So right off the bat, we have an admission that no studies have actually been done for the efficacy of masks for this particular virus. But we are implying effectiveness based on other studies for different viruses.</p>
<p>The paper the authors cite as most relevant used a sample size of 10 (!!) participants - this is tiny. Ignoring this important factor, the authors go on to say that this study showed that masks were effective at reducing transmission for coronaviruses (at least the ones used in the study). They go on to state that this "suggests" that masks would work for SARS-CoV-2. Sounds a bit weasel-wordy to me, and besides, I thought this virus was so novel that we knew nothing about it, and could assume nothing about it, so why are we doing that here?</p>
<p>The next relevant paper they cite, used only 4 participants. Not really worth going into the conclusions from that study.</p>
<p>The paper is littered with phrases like "Suggests that", "probably reduces", "is likely to", and my personal favourite, "moderate certainty" - what does that even mean?</p>
<p>I think the main take-away, for me, is that (according to this paper) no randomised trials of a significant size have ben carried out for SARS-CoV-2 to prove to a reasonable degree that masks are effective at stopping the spread. What you read from this study may be enough to suggest we change our way of life and wear masks everywhere, but it's not enough for me. Maybe that's where we differ.</p>

        <p>Sorry it took me so long to respond, I have been busy the last few days, but I’d still like to say a few more things. First of all, there have not been any randomized control studies for COVID-19 because it would be extremely unethical to subject people to that. No ethics board would approve a study that involves making a group of people not wear a mask during a global pandemic to see how it plays out for them. That's why we're looking at studies that have already been done.</p>
<p>I don't know where you heard that we can't infer anything about this virus because it's new, but that's not at all true. We can infer quite a bit about this virus because we know about other SARS virus strains. We also know enough about the virus to make safe, very likely accurate inferences about how we should be handling it. We know that it travels in spit droplets coming out of the nose and mouth, and we know the radius of a COVID-19 virus particle, as well as the average radius of the spit droplet it’s hitching a ride on. From this, we know that the virus+droplet combos are too big to escape through the small pores of a mask.</p>
<p>The reason that masks are able to stop the spread of the virus in one direction and not the other is because a mask prevents the user’s virus-infested spit droplets from becoming airborne. The “pores” of a mask are too small for the virus+droplet combo to pass through, so wearing a mask greatly reduces the number of virus+droplet combos that escape and become airborne. Why not 100%? Because a mask does not have an airtight seal around your face, so there is still a little room there for virus+droplet combos to escape and become airborne. If we prevent a significant number of virus+droplet combos from becoming airborne, then that will significantly reduce the risk of someone else inhaling an airborne virus+droplet combo through the sides of their mask. Airborne droplets are what spread COVID-19, and masks prevent the majority of droplets from becoming airborne. This means that by wearing masks, there will be far fewer airborne droplets floating around in the air, and thus a greatly reduced risk of inhaling any and becoming infected. Similar to airbags and seatbelts, the fact that it is not 100% flawless does not mean it’s not worth doing. </p>
<p>You rarely, if ever, are going to see a scientific study where the researchers use absolutes to describe the results and findings of their study, no matter how convincing the data is or how widely accepted the results are. That is not how science works at all. Science isn’t supposed to provide us with certainties, it’s just the best tool to get us as close to the truth as possible. This is why nearly every single scientific research paper that exists (no matter how uncontroversial the findings are) is going to use words and phrases like “suggests that” and “is likely”, because THAT’S HOW SCIENCE WORKS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915125/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915125/</a> This is a study on the correlation  between smoking cigarettes and developing cancer. Here’s a quote: “There was a slightly positive association between smoking and any cancer in both men and women.” Does this mean that scientists actually don’t know what they’re talking about, and there’s not really enough evidence to support the notion that cigarettes cause cancer? Or is it more reasonable to assume that even though to us regular non-scientist folk these phrases might appear as an admission of uncertainty, the researchers who dedicate their lives to thinking about and studying these topics are better able to accurately interpret the results of this study, and that they are able to more accurately make inferences on how the knowledge derived from the study should be applied? The majority of scientists agree that people should be wearing a mask and that masks are effective enough that it is worth making people wear them out in public. So I think the fact that you don't find these studies convincing doesn't really mean much. You are not an expert in interpreting research data, but the people who are very strongly encouraging the usage of masks.</p>

        <p>I mean, the OP of that post isn't wrong. If you're worried about your health, stay the fuck home. If you're worried about your grandma's health during a "pandemic", then don't fucking see her. I care about other people, but I am not gonna shut my life off to protect them. Like I said, if they're afraid, then they need to be self-isolating themselves and start giving a shit about what they're eating and how they're living. If you eat nothing but chips and Mountain Dew and do nothing but play video games in your mom's basement every waking hour, then I see no reason why I should go out of my way to protect you if you clearly don't give a shit about your health</p>

        <p>This is more political and IMO you have just barely leveraged this to have only a slight relevance to the actual lockdown.  Both parties have been horribly cruel in this regard, some of the republicans even cheered when one of their own died (McCain) and few of the rest of them even complained about it. Such casual political cruelty is not lockdown related.  </p>
<p>However, on the subject of casual cruelty to older folks, this recalls to mind the DNRs they were pushing on older people with covid not long ago.</p>

<p>Except that the Left very much is a hivemind, with little deviation in viewpoint or even the manner of expression of viewpoint to be found in its rank and file,</p>

<p>&rt; Funny how the OP lumps all of the people who said "so you just want old  people to die" (because you anti science fools wont wear masks) </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Case in point. There is nothing resembling a consensus in the scientific or medical communities supporting mask usage. That's a talking point I've seen pushed by social media "scientists" whose degrees, when their resumes can be found, turn out to be in subjects like education (an english teacher in training).</p>
<p>You don't get to legitimately place your talking points beyond debate just by unilaterally declaring them to be science. Or by bullying actual scientists into recanting, when their findings don't fit in with what you want to hear, eg. the WHO study that found a low rate of transmission by asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19.</p>
<p>But please, as a PhD candidate with a Physics degree, I so want to hear more about how I and my immediate family members (including two medical researchers, one of them the former head of medicine at his hospital, a clinical physician and a PhDed biologist), none of them supporters of your narrative, are all "anti-science fools." Because I am <strong>so</strong> sure that you're qualified to say something about that?</p>
<p>This is the point at which you fabricate some credentials, isn't it? I'm getting so tired of debunking those claims. It's not that hard, but it takes so much time, and I have stuff to do.</p>

        <p>Ah! Argument by non sequitur, that charming old Left Wing specialty. That's also BS, and you know it.</p>
<p>Issues on which sharp divides can be found on the right (eg. outsourcing and the presidency of GW Bush) are easily found.</p>
<p>We almost all agree that the Left is a hivemind, not because we walk in lockstep, but because you guys actually do function as a hivemind. Independent thought does not translate into contrarianism on matters of observable reality. Take a group of genuine free thinkers and have them watch a sunrise, and they'll all agree it took place in the East, except for the free thinker who just got done using a crack pipe.</p>
<p>The same principle applies here. Wondering - is it time for me to block you, yet? I really don't have time for sophistry. Either start arguing in good faith, immediately, or we're done.</p>

        <p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j4k9qe/typical/g7kkoit/">this comment</a>, above. Waldoh has doubled down on a claim that a scientist currently in grad school is "an anti-science nutter." As is his brother who already has completed his PhD in Biology and has published in the literature for his field.</p>
<p>How can a scientist be anti-science? Waldoh is obviously beyond the reach of reason. He obviously doesn't want to be reasonable. He's a nut, by choice.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Waldoh.</p>

<p>Is this a serious question? Did you know a "scientist" started the anti vax movement? Did you know a "scientist" came up with the demon sperm theory? Just because someone goes to school doesnt mean they are not anti science. </p>
<p>You should know that or admit you are arguing in bad faith.</p>
<p>You call yourself a scientist, constructing strawmen, appealing to authority, are you playing logical fallacy BINGO? I'd ask for my money back from wherever you got that PhD lol</p>

<p>I said no such thing but you can twist my words however you want if it makes you feel better.</p>
<p>Maybe you should ask that question to the millions of right wingers that have wished for Obama's death for the past 10+ years. Or all you nutters that wanted hillary to die from pneumonia in the last election. </p>

        <p>How about the happy comments when McCain died that came from his own party and how about how few of those that didn't make such comments, also did not condemn those that did?  Oh yeah, there's plenty of cruelty to go around on both sides of the table, don't fool yourself otherwise, there's reason beyond just politics that certain massive reddit groups were banned or quarantined, they were calling for killing, torture, string em up, etc for various democrats on about every 4th post.  It was at least as ugly as what Trump is getting now.</p>

<p>Also, how did Trump physically kill 210,000 people — does local and state power, and most importantly personal responsibility + hygiene just not exist? Besides, I condemn any kind of speech such as that, and just about everyone here will, too. I hate Obama, but I would never wish ill on him or his family.</p>

<p>By refusing to wear a mask, by calling the virus a hoax, by saying it’ll just magically disappear, by blocking the CDC from doing its job... but most of all, by telling his millions of his supporters in no uncertain terms that wearing a mask is not required. If everyone had just worn a mask in public, it would already be over. We wouldn’t have a 9/11 death toll every day.</p>
<p>Nearly every other country has this under control now. New cases are in the single digits. We have tens of thousands of new cases every day. More Americans have died than any other country. Despite only having 5% of the population, we have 25% of the deaths.</p>

        <p>The problem that you liberals never understand is <em>personal responsibility</em>. You always think someone, typically in government, should be there to hand you every single little thing in life. What today’s general US population never looks at is that we are one of the unhealthiest developed countries in the world. We’re a leader in heart disease, obesity, diabetes, sedentary life, etc. — but no one talks about that, despite the fact that it’s one of the largest contributors to severe cases. Don’t give me this BS that words of one person = responsibility for 210,000 deaths. It’s not the job of the government to force people out of their jobs and end all livelihoods so people like <em>you</em> can feel safe.</p>
<p>Besides, Trump closed travel from China early on, helped ramp up testing and getting Governors what they needed, and all of your side complained about that then, too. Also, most of these enforcements are not something that can be done at the federal level, so you can likely thank your governor or mayor if you are unhappy with your surrounding outcome.</p>
