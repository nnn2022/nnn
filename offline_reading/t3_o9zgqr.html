    <strong>Any Catholic/Protestant churches in TX, GA, NC, NC, FL, WA that never cancelled in-person services through the thick of the restrictions...</strong>
    <p><p>... like Pastor John McArthur's church in CA, or the Canadian Pastors who got arrested?</p>
<p>My religion was not meant for self preserving health wusses who sing that "their treasure is in heaven when we see the Lord" but panic and cling to their lives here like cockroaches flipped upside down at the sight of someone sneezing. See Jesus dealing with lepers and Martin Luther dealing with epidemics.</p>
<p>Family and I are anticipating an eventual pivoting point where we'll have to choose between obeying the state or obeying our religion.</p>
<p>In order to prolong my family's freedoms for as long as possible, I would like to belong to a church that is willing to break eventual draconian laws in order to congregate as a church, and be persecuted (just like that other religion, Christianity,  in the old days. It really shouldn't be a new concept to christians).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>Established churches and denominations are well and truly toast. They're either compromised or cowards.</p>
<p>The only option left for real Christians is a house church, my friend.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's how I survived 9 months where churches were closed: illegal church meetings like Christians in Iran and China.</p>

        <p>I think almost everyone everywhere from ... "our perspective" ...had good intentions at the beginning of this whole thing and "sat out" when we were told "two weeks to flatten the curve." </p>
<p>So I think finding what you are trying to find with the criteria that you are using is going to be a little harder than you think.</p>

        <p>A very small church I used to go to in Concord, NC (haven't left, just got a new job that impedes my ability to attend any functions). Solid teaching (the preacher is a John MacArthur fanboy tbh lol) and friendly people. I don't think they ever stopped in-person services. They might've for a couple weeks at the very beginning when people thought coronavirus was gonna be a huge deal but they certainly picked right back up once it was apparent that it was really about suppressing freedom rather than the virus.</p>

        <p>I felt the same about our church, we actually stopped going. Looked another one. Same thing. “Oh I can’t wait for the day to take off this mask.” Sermon title “Faith.” So now which is it? I don’t know. We stopped going to church, found some nice sermons and YouTube so now we just listen to something on a Sunday morning. It’s not much but at least it helps.</p>

        <p>Catholic here in SoCal. I cannot begin to tell you how disgusted I am with our churches here. It was finally the breaking point for me although my church going was already hanging by a thread due to all sorts of other chicanery our church has pulled locally.</p>
<p>Had all my sacraments, attended church all my life, went to our catholic school for junior high, helped run our gift shop for years after mass. The whole way always being told it was out church, our priests that provided mass even in the face of death from communism, during plagues, etc. We held strong even in hiding in other's homes because saying mass and receiving the eucharist is <strong><em>the</em></strong> most important thing.</p>
<p>Well. We were the first to close. Last to open. No weddings. No faith formation. No priests visiting the sick. No confessions. Even when reopened they removed half the masses. But they never stopped asking for money through online giving. Oh hell no.</p>
<p>They taught us that we don't in fact need them. They taught us that they were liars about how important receiving the eucharist was. That we don't need their masses and funeral rites. Their last rites or confessions. It was all unimportant. None of it mattered. "Just watch it online or on tv." Well then if none of it matters then <em>they</em> don't matter. So fuck them. I'm done. I'll attend a family funeral of course and if my mom really makes a stink about going to christmas or easter mass ever again which I doubt because they showed up those two high holy important omg it's a mortal sin if you don't go masses weren't important either. Then I'll go, for her. But otherwise I'm done. I get more out of reading a missal at home than mass anyway.</p>

        <p>Catholic in OR here, and I was also shocked and angry over the church willingly shutting down. I have also been looking for a place to worship that believes in freedom and the truth that our spirits are more important than corporeal living. No luck here either.</p>
<p>Some of the protestant denoms here have opened up and without distancing or masking. I've gone but its not the same, I miss my church. I go to an Orthodox church now for my husband and have been maskless since Jan of this year when we started going back to Mass. No one has bothered me after an initial offer.</p>
<p>I also am trying to find people to maybe have for home church in case things get worse, which I think is not all that far away.</p>

        <p>The church I went to had weak sermons and followed the standard show pattern.</p>
<p>When this last year happened, they closed down and did online only.  They eventually opened with limited seating and masks.  I  haven't been there in over a year.</p>
<p>Home church is the way to go.</p>
