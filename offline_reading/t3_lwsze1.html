    <strong>GoFund My Doomer Vacation</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been receiving links and increasing pressure to help find a former co-worker’s vacation. Former co-worker is the biggest lockdown proponent on my FB. She has actively chosen to remain out of work due to her underlying conditions and her lack of interest in teaching on Zoom. Her husband is currently teaching from home and barely makes enough to cover their bills. She updates her FB often about how they are behind in their mortgage. Despite these pesky facts, they’ve traveled all over the SE US during the past year and now would like other people to start funding their travel as they’re “being safe” and “deserve mental health support” during these “difficult times.” Whenever they travel, she brags about lecturing people on why they should wear masks to keep people like her safe and claims she’s changed hearts and minds all over the southern US. Yea right. </p>
<p>I was shocked when I received the first request for money and all the more amazed with the the follow-up emails from her pressuring me to give money because they’ve had a rough year. (I run a FIRE/frugal living page and believe this is why she’s singling me out in particular to hound for money.)  It seems very much a case of the truth is stranger than fiction and is difficult for me to believe. </p>
<p>I hope this is just one selfish family being weirdoes and not a sign of how unbelievable things may become in the immediate future.</p></p>

        <p>Sounds like she is using Convid as an excuse to be a subpar human, there is a lot of that going on. </p>
<p>Like the ones that yell "Trust the Science" but failed to read a single Convid medical coding, as it would become obvious assumptions and diagnostic testing are equal for Convid <strong>(U07.1/U07.2/Interim-ID-02).</strong> <em>They even change their websites</em> (CDC/WHO has multiple times, I've archived it) <em>and require .pdf downloads to hide the damned coding, which is insane</em></p>

        <p>I certainly hope this is not a trend. Imagine the balls and lack of awareness you’d have to have to ask your friends to fund your vacation. Illness anxiety disorder is a serious mental illness to begin with, and extremely common. Tack on the social and mental toll this woman has put herself through for a year, and you’re seeing the disturbing results. I actually feel bad for her and her family, but I sure as fuck wouldn’t fund her vacation.</p>
