        <p>I'm afraid the scamdemic may be just a cover story for much bigger changes being put into place.  While everyone's worried about masks and distancing, TPTB are collapsing the economy, society, and civilization.  Most troubling.</p>

        <p>SS:  So, how long will all of this last?  Two weeks in early 2020?  Until summer?  Christmas/New Year?  A vaccine?</p>
<p>How about forever?  </p>
<p>The good doctor (England's deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam) answered some readers' questions.  (I'm adding emphasis in <strong>bold</strong>).</p>
<p>1: Anonymous: Once everyone who is vulnerable has been vaccinated, can we go back to life as normal? Are you hoping to lift restrictions after the first vaccination wave ends in mid February?</p>
<p>JVT: ‚Äú<strong>We are in a really dangerous place now</strong> - you can see what it‚Äôs like in hospitals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI completely understand that people want to know when we can lift restrictions. It is natural.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut <strong>no vaccine is going to change and turn the ship around overnight</strong>.</p>
<p>"We are going to have a very difficult couple of months.</p>
<p>‚Äú<strong>When we are confident</strong> that we have got <strong>on top of the severe disease</strong> and are bringing infection levels down, <strong>then we can advise</strong> government ministers about what <strong>flexibility</strong> they have got to <strong>start to relax the rules</strong>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut here is the rub on this - <strong>if people start relaxing</strong> now they are going to give the vaccine a headwind to run into, and <strong>they are going to make it harder for us to get those effects we want to see so badly.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>2: Sam Irving¬†-¬†If everyone is given a vaccine by Autumn, why talk of restrictions next winter?</p>
<p>JVT: <strong>"I don‚Äôt think we are ever going to take this virus away out of humankind</strong>. I think the virus is going to continue to change over time, as the disease has already shown signs of doing.</p>
<p>"And I think the virus is likely to be with us probably for the foreseeable future - probably in the same way that flu is.</p>
<p>‚Äú<strong>I can‚Äôt tell you how long the vaccine protection is going to last</strong> for. We are very hopeful it is going to be in the region of a very high number of months, possibly a small number of years. But <strong>we can‚Äôt say</strong> yet.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the virus is going to continue to change there will come a point where <strong>we will have to reformulate the vaccines</strong>.‚Äù</p>
<p>3 : Luke - Will face masks still need to be used even when everyone is vaccinated ?</p>
<p>JVT: ‚ÄúThe pandemic has changed a lot of things. It has changed the way you and I approach hand hygiene. We all carry hand sanitiser around now, we all expect in most of the places we go into that hand sanitiser is provided at the door.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think there are going to be people who make a personal decision to say, you know what, when I‚Äôm in a crowded place in the winter I‚Äôm going to put a face covering on. When I‚Äôm on a tube I am going to put a face covering on.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt think the government has any intention that we should all walk around forever and a day distinguishing each other only by peering through a face covering.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut I think individuals at different levels will choose to keep some of the infection precautionary behaviour that we have had to adopt as a matter of absolute necessity during Covid.‚Äù</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>7: Snap Dragon - When a person has received both doses of the vaccine and it has taken effect, <strong>will they be able to drop their own restrictions so that they can make physical contact with family and friends?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JVT: ‚ÄúNo. No. It is a flat no on that one.</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúWe know that the vaccines are effective in preventing infection. We don‚Äôt know if they are effective in preventing transmission.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs a really hard thing for people who have been vaccinated to swallow, the rules still apply. They apply to the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUntil we have got tens of millions of people vaccinated, where we have got tangible evidence on reducing transmission, and where we can see disease rates falling in the population and be confident we are in the right place.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat is not until, my guess, the mid to late Spring.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf they relax too soon they are going to give this vaccine a headwind in which to do its work.</p>
<p>‚Äú<strong>The vaccine effects are going to take three months until we see them properly, and until then no one can relax</strong>."</p>
<ol>
<li>Zakk Kaye - Do you blame members of the public who have become complacent and careless for the severe increase in cases, and unfortunately deaths recently?</li>
</ol>
<p>JVT: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it is a question of blame. It is a question of the fact that we have lived with these restrictions in some way shape or form for so long we learnt to manage that our own way.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd we forget that a new variant emerged and became dominant in the last few months of 2020.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúWe are just not in a safe space at all. And people cannot afford to make up their own rules.</strong></p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúSomebody has said - I don‚Äôt go to supermarkets but I do meet up with my friends.</strong></p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúWell, I am sorry - all the rules apply all of the time.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Still not getting the picture?  It's not over until they say it is.  Even if you take the <em>vaccine</em>, you are not free to do as you please.</p>

        <p>To be fair, he said some people will make the personal decision to continue wearing them - which I‚Äôm all for. I think it‚Äôs dumb, but fair enough if they want to.</p>
<p>My worry is that this new guilt associated with infectious disease stays. I cannot be bothered with people acting like doing any non-essential activity while feeling under the weather is ‚Äòselfish‚Äô or that you‚Äôre directly responsible for a person dying by doing it. Toxic, backwards mindset that so many have adopted.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that part didn't bother me too much.  I was much more bothered by his saying that  if the virus mutates, we'll have to have new vaccines and that the vaccinated cannot decide to visit friends and family or stop wearing masks and distancing even months after the vaccine has taken effect. I don't like that scenario one bit.</p>

        <p>I have a feeling that if/when they make masks voluntary again, there'll still be people who'll come at you with a hammer for not wearing one. The stigma of being unmasked will remain for years, probably.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôll admit I skimmed through it but I just feel like the author exaggerated the words of the professional. Clearly both parties are open to the idea of this lasting forever but the wording from the guy being interviewed seemed less harsh than the authors quotes. Maybe idk I could be way off</p>

        <p>No, I get that.  Clickbait and what-not.  Still, I'd be much happier if the prof were saying that this is nearly over and we don't have to keep doing this.</p>
