    <strong>Article: working at the office only 2 days a week to become new normal at big Dutch Bank</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/business/artikel/5170360/niet-meer-naar-kantoor-bij-abn-amro-na-corona</p>
<p>So a big bank here, ABN Amro, is saying that even though it is allowed again, they will open the office only a tiny bit. Apparently because people “are not interested in working at the office.” So in the new normal the office will become only “a clubhouse, not a place to work” </p>
<p>Apparently “less than 4% wants to return to fulltime work” (yeah... logical. They get benefits). </p>
<p>“A 1-on-1 conversation can be done just as well outside in a forest or while walking  a pre-determined route around the office building. The office get-togethers can be done through Teams. But how do you train the young new employees who could learn so much from workfloor conversations? How does a boss give bad news through Zoom and how does Teambuilding work at a distance? How do you get social cohesion? “</p>
<p>Apparently none of these questions have answers yet </p>
<p>“People wonder if they will still be valued the same as they were before” </p>
<p>News flash: i’m guessing they wont be. 
Also: no kore lease cars or parking space for your car. </p>
<p>“The bank will offer a place to work for people who absolutely cannot work from home. The bank says: ‘Especially young people often dont yet have an organized home with a home office. But even there we see our employees being flexible. Some colleagues go to their parents’ house to work’ “</p>
<p>Instead of building meaningful professional relationships with our co-workers we now move back in with our parents for hours every working day. </p>
<p>Am i the only one who sees a problem here!??
Fuck this new normal!</p></p>

        <p>I honestly think with enough time the "work from home" fans will start to realize the lack of team cohesion and the inability to get a change of environment from home actually hurts. Right now it's a new change of pace and saving time on getting ready for work or driving has it's advantages, but I assume the novelty will wear off. By then, they will not likely have the option to go back into the office because the business has realized how much money they are saving on rent. Even worse, they could be outsourced easily to some dudes in India also working from home for way less.</p>

        <p>Why drive to your parents house to work when you could just go into the office. I don’t get it</p>

        <p>As someone who's done remote work long before this plandemic, it's not a blanket viable solution for every person and/or every business.</p>
<p>It requires a unique, self-motivated person to do. And some tasks lend themselves better to remote working than others. I love not being bothered while I'm trying to focus on things.</p>
<p>Other people just need that office structure. There's nothing wrong with it, but some people have a hard time separating work from home.</p>
<p>On the other side, good support from the company is also required. Some companies are awful at this, but others are better.</p>

        <p>I have been working from home for years. I have a dedicated office with a laptop dock, multiple monitors, nice keyboard/mouse, and a very nice headset for calls. I suspect most people right now are working off of a laptop on the kitchen table. Productivity is going to be garbage trying to work like that. Most people seem to just use the shitty microphone on their laptop for calls as well which makes meetings a nightmare. Basically, working from home is great for certain people if you are invested in it. Most people aren't.</p>
