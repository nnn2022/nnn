        <p>Well mRNA has been studied since the 80's but there's never been an mRNA Vax to make it to market so one that was pushed out at like 20× the rate of a normal Vax doesn't really scream volumes of being tried and trusted. If they could have done it successfully in 8 months then they would have done it successfully in 40 years, but they couldn't and they can't.</p>
<p>The only one of the 3 recommended by the CDC that isn't an mRNA had to be put on pause because it was giving people blood clots in their brain and shit. 8 months is not long enough for one stage of human testing let alone the whole gotdamn process. You can tell yourself whatever you want but pLeAsE sToP sPrEaDiNg MiSiNfOrMaTiOn.</p>

        <p>I don't care that it came from a template of a different coronavirus, unless they used a time machine or were given prior knowledge by the lab that created it then they cannot have created a vaccine for <strong>this specific virus</strong> in a timeframe less than previously stated.</p>
<p>They never could create one to complete the review process in the 15 years they worked on similar viruses so how those years count for anything but to encourage fear of the velocity with which these jabs got fired out of the assembly line is beyond me.</p>

        <p>My favorite question about the technology is, "Can you get an mRNA shot for a different pathogen after the covid shot?" The research that's been done over the past couple decades was intended to make a sort of "plug and play" vaccine base, but I can't imagine programming cells to make a handful of proteins would be a good thing to do.</p>
<p>If it turns out that the human body can have only one type of mRNA shot at a time, how long it takes to process that one may become vitally important. It'd be a shame if mRNA could be used in the future to prevent a truly deadly disease, but only if one hadn't taken it to prevent the sniffles in 2021.</p>

        <p>I had Covid last Spring and have long Covid.  I never had lung issues but had really gnarly body symptoms.  I still get chills/aches in my legs constantly.  I had positive antibodies in two blood panels (July, December 2020) and a positive PCR in May, but I don't trust PCR tests anymore after everything I've learned.  It would be nice to ask the creator some questions but he died.. of pneumonia.. in 2019.....</p>
<p>It was starting to get better amd the antibody levels seemed to remain the same.  We're destroying so much good data on how long Covid immunity lasts by urging everyone to get the vaccine.  Wouldn't it be scientific to allow people who've had Covid and test positive for antibodies?  I would have rather just gotten monthly antibody blood draws than the horrible mistake I made of getting the vaccine in March since my employer was signaling they were going to mandate it and there was so much social pressure that I caved.  It was a cowardly move but here I am.  Guess what, they mandated it.  Even still I don't want to submit my paperwork and comply with their medical tyranny.</p>
<p>Now there's been talk of boosters and people CAN'T WAIT ZOMG.  How long until not only is the first round mandatory, but anytime a booster drops I bet I'll have to comply.  Oh and we also have internal vaccine passports to get in the building which means that you've met the vaccine mandate (once in effect in September), you have attested to having no symptoms, and you have met the testing requirements.</p>
<p>The testing requirement is that you need to have a negative PCR test to return on site.  Unvaccinated employees with approved exemptions will have to be masked on company property at all times, and receive a PCR swab weekly.  If you are vaccinated once you pass the initial test then you have to just continue meeting the health contract you have to sign to meet the new compliance requirements.  There's plenty of snitch lines set up in case you don't comply so they'll make sure you comply.  Then if you keep up with the vaccination mandate you don't have to receive a PCR test, only when you pop up in a lottery where there is no clarification about how it works, how the selection is made, etc.</p>
<p>Get me off this crazy train.  It feels like no one around me sees how sick, demented, and dangerous this is and where it can lead.  I can't begin to go on about how demoralized I've become over this and how everyone is in some bizarre form of Stockholm syndrome.  This is at least the work culture in NYC, it might be different elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think about changing jobs, but this seems to be creeping into everything and I actually enjoy the work I do.  Sometimes I've thought about how much I just wished I would wake up from this nightmare or just die in my sleep.  I've never planned to kill myself but the amount of hopelessness, dread, despair, etc... I've experienced over the last year has absolutely crushed me</p>
<p>Things are on the upswing.  I'm resisting in little ways, but I know I'm going to be tested soon.  I try to enjoy life and not let the despair of the situation get to me.  There still is so much to live for.  There still are good people.  I cling onto that little bit of hope but it looks dark.</p>
<p>Fortify yourself because this is far from over.  I hope I'm wrong.  It doesn't seem to be that way though.  Either way we've accepted so much government overreach in the last year.  This feels like the aftermath of 9/11 but it's so much more far-reaching and sinister.  People are starting to see but not enough, and not fast enough.</p>
<p>You may find out who your friends REALLY are soon.  Be careful.</p>

        <p>Can you elaborate on the leg pain thing? Someone I know is having unexplained leg pain very often and is worried. They were most likely sick with covid early 2020. Doctors can't find an explanation.</p>

        <p>It's not like neuropathy, it's something different entirely.  It's like that aching and chills you get when you're sick or coming down with something.</p>
<p>My blood work was normal after Covid and confirmed antibodies so it's not something like diabetic neuropathy.</p>
<p>It's like those body aches/chills you get when you have the a bad cold or the flu, except it never goes away, but it isn't ever-present for me.  If I eat clean and get plenty of sleep it's less bad, but still happens sometimes.</p>
<p>I've found ways of managing it through supplements because I try to avoid using acetaminophen/paracetamol or any NSAIDs, not that I'm against taking pharmaceutical drugs but I try to manage my health through nutrition and exercise first.</p>
<p>I find that DOs are better than MDs when it comes to actually assisting you with your health problems.  I know it's a generalization, but it's been my personal experience with providers.</p>

        <p>You're last statement is so true it hurts. The hate towards those that simply question the narrative is real... Those who dont follow are dirty, selfish, unclean, contributing to the downfall of civilization. PAPERS PLEASE .</p>
<p>Where are the studies on natural immunity from. Infection? -not in msm</p>
<p>Where are the ghost editing and flip-flopping of WHO\CDC/FAUCI? Not in msm</p>
<p>Where dis I hear that tgose who refuse the vaccine deserve to die? MSM</p>
<p>Personal beliefs should be recognized if they dont directly cause harm to others. I HATE the two party system and the extremes on both sides, but I respect their rights to believe what they want. They dont deserve re-education, imprisonment, or death.</p>
