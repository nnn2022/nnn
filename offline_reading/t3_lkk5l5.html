    <strong>Serious Question</strong>
    <p><p>And I know I’m going to sound ignorant because I am, and I’m sure I will get some negative comments but this is a serious question. </p>
<p>I’ve seen some people express concerns about blood transfusions from “vaccine” recipients with the claim that the artificial mrna can be transferred to them through the blood of a donor. </p>
<p>Is this a valid concern? I mean I really don’t want this shit anywhere near my body. </p>
<p>But I was also wondering about sex. Can a female be contaminated through the semen of someone who has it? </p>
<p>Are children going to start being born with this artificial protein? </p>
<p>I’m admitting I am ignorant, so no need to be mean, I’m genuinely curious how this works and can’t find any real information about it.</p></p>

        <p>After about 3 weeks there isn’t any mRNA left. It’s the same as a normal vaccine except it just uses the spike protein instead of a full or parts of a virus.</p>
<p>And vaccines are safe and have made life much much better.</p>
<p>Polio, TB, Flu, Measles and soon Coronavirus have all had their effects on the community weakened or eliminated because of vaccinations.</p>
<p>And there is no scientific basis to many anti vaccine claims such as the use of mercury or other heavy metals as these are in a compound with their properties changed (Sort of like sodium which reacts violently with water and chlorine a toxic gas make table salt)</p>
<p>Or them being less effective than a round of the virus. Which in some cases is true however the damage to the body is significantly for example measles which deletes the bodies immune memory as bad as years of unchecked HIV in the process.</p>
<p>I can only urge anyone to get a vaccine because the risks are far outweighed by the rewards.</p>

        <p>It’s approved for emergency use to skip the red tape that usually holds vaccines back.</p>
<p>The trials for under 18s haven’t been conducted and that’s why it isn’t recommended for under 18s and cannot be completely authorised. However, trials for most of the population have been completed </p>
<p>If the government was really hiding the safety of the vaccines then why wouldn’t they just fully authorise them?</p>

        <p>I think you’re entirely missing the point. Clinical trials are not “red tape”, and there’s a reason why they go on for at least a few years. They are how we discover the risks both short and long term to a treatment. The reproductive toxicity trials haven’t happened yet either. So to blindly say “it’s safe!” is incorrect: there simply has not been enough time to evaluate the long term effects. In the US, FDA approved vaccines (meaning ones that have passed clinical trials) can be mandated for school. Emergency authorized vaccines (meaning ones that have not completed clinical trials) cannot</p>

        <p>You are mistaking the underlying vaccine technology (in this case MRNA) for the actual vaccine. All vaccines need to be studied for a certain length of time (usually 3+ years) to prove safety, as all vaccines deal with different viruses. The mechanism of the vaccine (in this case MRNA) has been studied before 2020 but that has no bearing on the safety of a covid MRNA vaccine. That’s like saying oh we know how live virus vaccines work, so just make one for a new virus and send it out. That’s not how it works</p>

        <p>They have not. </p>
<p>“For vaccines to be effective, a specific target is needed. This vaccine target, also called an antigen, is typically a fragment of the disease-causing agent that instructs the immune system on how to recognize and destroy it upon contact. Searching for a suitable antigen can be an arduous process but prior coronavirus research made it all easier.     </p>
<p>"When the Chinese put up the COVID-19 sequence on bioRxiv in January, our community of scientists looked at it and said, 'Yeah, we got this because we know how to do it.' It was all about plug and play based on all that experience," said Hotez.”</p>
<p>The prior SARS research helped speed up the covid 19 research, but as this virus strain did not exist prior to 2020, it is impossible to say that they’ve been in development since SARS. </p>

        <p>That’s what I said.</p>
<p>The actual vaccine architecture was already there they just modified it for the new strain.</p>
<p>Probably my wording wasn’t clear</p>
<p>That and several other factors  help speed up development and certification</p>

        <p>Creation or development is different than certification. </p>
<p>Once a potential vaccine solution is found, it takes 3+ years just for human clinical trials. That plus development and animal trials usually brings the process to 7+ years for each vaccine.</p>

        <p>But that is without the huge pressure behind the vaccines, investment and collaboration from around the world, the scores of people volunteered for trials, the red tape surrounding certification and production being increased.</p>
<p>The independent certification bodies such as the MHRA here in the UK only care about safety and efficacy not how long it takes.</p>

        <p>You cannot evaluate long term safety (meaning effects that impair long term health) without the variable of time. </p>
<p>It does not matter how many people within the span of one year sign up to be vaccinated, how badly you wish for a safe vaccine, how much money is invested. You need time to show that the injuries that present themselves over time are not higher than in the placebo group.</p>
<p>Edit: which is precisely why the human clinical trials will not be over until 2023, and likely continue on in some way to further evaluate long term effects. This is experimental by nature</p>

        <p>That is literally the point of having clinical trials that expand over 3+ years. To evaluate long term effects like rates of auto immune disease. </p>
<p>The effects could very well show themselves after the clinical trial ends. That’s why they usually are several phases and several years long. Which may even be too short but is the scientifically accepted minimum requirement. </p>
<p>You just showed why simply saying there’s no risks to long term health after 1 year before the clinical trials are complete is absurd</p>

        <p>Firstly, phase one and phase two trials were condensed and done simultaneously.</p>
<p>Second, most of why vaccines take so long is funding. Since trials are expensive they’re done over a longer time to spread cost. </p>
<p>Lastly, the technology behind the vaccines isn’t new and is well understood ( mRNA) therefore we know the risk of long term effects is probably low.</p>
<p>But I’ll remind you what’s at stake. We have 13000 people dying every day. Time is of the essence.</p>
<p>Are you really suggesting that we stop rollout and make sure to spread the trials so we can identify unlikely long term effects instead of taking a small risk and saving lives?</p>

        <p>You are not addressing what I have said to you. </p>
<p>The reason trials are long (meaning more than 1 year, or 1 month if you want to apply your logic) is because you need TIME to evaluate the effects on fertility and long term health. </p>
<p>Usually after development, there are animal trials that last for the entire length of the animals natural life span to compare any discrepancies between the control group. So with mice, you’re looking at 2 years minimum. </p>
<p>Next once the safety is relatively proved, you move to human trials, which last a minimum of 3 years as you study reproductive toxicity and presentation of any adverse effects. </p>
<p>If people want to take a vaccine that has unknown risks on long term health and fertility because the reproductive trials have not been done and the clinical trials are ongoing, that is their choice. I do think everyone should be well informed as informed consent is crucial to making health decisions. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that none of these vaccines are meant to prevent transmission or even infection, nor can they prove that it does. So that actual utility is even questionable. </p>
<p>I would like it if you would take some time to think about this yourself, because simply repeating basic research concepts to you is exhausting.</p>

        <p>Phase 1 and 2 trials were done with an overlap to reduce time.</p>
<p>Phase 3 trials were sped up with human challenge trials for some of the vaccines.</p>
<p>But again if the independent regulators weren’t satisfied with the safety of the vaccine such as the MHRA they wouldn’t have approved them.</p>
<p>And yes the vaccines are designed to stop transmission and infection. To what degree they do so is not yet know and that’s why social distancing is still necessary however, very soon we will have the data to conclude what the effectiveness is.</p>
<p>And even if they cannot prevent transmission they’re still able to reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill.</p>
<p>And again the technology behind the vaccines and the risks associated are well understood. </p>

        <p>That’s incorrect. The UK has not approved it, just granted emergency authorization. Same as US. </p>
<p>You cannot speed up the process of evaluating long term risks. Please tell me how you think you can evaluate long term risk for which the variable of time is needed without the variable of time. </p>
<p>And the goal of these vaccines as described by their clinical trials is to prevent disease not infection or transmission as they know they cannot prove it, at least short term. That’s why the effectiveness rates are described as a reduction in symptoms</p>

        <p>My only issue is that we don’t know if the mRNA is really “gone” from a person’s system at all. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that recycles mRNA back into the cell’s genome. Because this is still very much experimental in a lot of ways, you can’t really account for the uptake of the vaccines RNA sequence. </p>
<p>That said, you’re right about conventional vaccines that were put through proper clinical and animal trials before approval.</p>

        <p>Stop regurgitating that, "vaccines are safe and effective" narrative. We should respect the parents who have watched their children regress and even die following their shots. The irrefutable evidence comes strongly from the experiences of young teens and young adults who have gotten, in particular, the Gardasil vaccine. I don't understand why people have so much faith in these shots, a lot of the diseases these shots "eradicated" were already on a steep decline before the shots were even introduced.</p>

        <p>Name me one instance of that happening </p>
<p>What about the parents who have to watch their kids die from measles, polio or tuberculosis because people don’t get vaccinated. Because that’s happening every second of everyday.</p>
<p>What about the millions of children that have been saved as a result of small pox being eradicated?</p>
<p>Stop trying to fear monger.</p>
<p>And are you seriously using anecdotal evidence for the HPV Vaccine? Or is there scientific evidence to your claim?</p>
<p>And also name me one virus that was as you say on its easy out, As in about to die naturally, because <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HC9yV9oT8lg/TjgjdJLKJkI/AAAAAAAAH14/s6uxQFxVacg/s1600/Measles_US_1944-2007_inset.png">measles </a> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/exports/reported-paralytic-polio-cases-and-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1910_v5_850x600.svg">polio</a>
