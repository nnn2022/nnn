    <strong>Where have all my favourite restaurants and pubs gone!?! THIS TOWN IS COMING LIKE A GHOST TOWN!</strong>
    <p><p>So with our benevolent overlords' new glorious roadmap out of lockdown and my toilet paper supply dwindling (I bulk bought in first lockdown and have been rationing since: one strip, one wipe a day) I decided to brave the outside World for the first time since this pandemic started in earnest. Ahead of time I procured myself a giant hamster ball so I could avoid coming into contact with others; word to the wise, DO NOT travel down steep hills in one of these things! Ever played Super Monkey Ball? It was like that, only with more vomit and screaming.</p>
<p>But I digress. Rolling down the street in my zorb ball was both liberating and terrifying. I had several masks on, of course I did, but I could SENSE the Covid around me and every time I saw another human being I could only see them as pestilent petri dishes and walking variant factories. GROSS! Some of them gave me strange looks over the rim of their masks; one person even shook their head for some reason and even <em>took off his mask.</em> I gagged (and not because of the sick slushing around my protective orb).</p>
<p>Slightly less shocking than that incident though was that all my favourite restaurants, pubs and shops were boarded up for some reason...? What the actual fuck happened? The town center was like a fucking ghost town! My pre-Covid pub of choice, The Entitled Hipster, was CLOSED PERMANENTLY! My heart sank in my chest; where would I go to browse Reddit whilst drinking imported ales that taste like tramp's piss now? It's almost as if locking down the country and forbidding people from buying shit has sunk the economy and rendered small businesses bankrupt or something? I must be wrong here, guys. The lockdowns were our ONLY SOLUTION. The EXPERTS and SCIENTISTS said so!</p>
<p>I guess I'll just carry on spending my furlough money on Amazon packages and DoorDash deliveries...</p></p>

        <p>What? I do not believe you were so cheap as to not give at least 200% of what you spent a month to their gofundme to support your local businesses!!! Have you no shame?</p>
