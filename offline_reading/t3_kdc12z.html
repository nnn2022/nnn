    <strong>Why are we letting this happen?</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry if I’m a horrible writer or anything, but why are we letting a virus no worse than the flu run us into a dystopian future?
I remember back in March before the lockdowns, these same lefties were all saying “we don’t have to shut down, that’s xenophobia!” and then all of a sudden, shutting down became necessary to “flatten the curve” which didn’t work at all. These same people wanted to have spring break, got a lockdown, and now they’re all for lockdowns and shit. 
Why are people also now thinking a vaccine for the flu p2 should be mandatory? Guess rights be damned, gotta keep the public health safe I guess even though many people get the flu vaccine every year and some get really shit from it. I’ve never gotten a flu shot, and never needed one. I don’t know why people are letting this be control them, I wish people would stand up more and resist.</p></p>

        <p>Yup, you’re right. I, along with the leading medical experts, are still learning about COVID with new information being released every day.</p>
<p>When will the world realize that scientists are idiots and the general public knows more than experts who’ve dedicated significant portions of their lives to study and understand viruses like this? Smithy_Furt, you think Fauci will ever be as smart as you?</p>

        <p>It's hilarious that your example is Fauci, who is not even an actual scientist. Fauci is a crooked administrator who's greased big time by Big Pharma. You're being brainwashed and lied to by the liberal media industrial complex, God help your soul. Good day.</p>

<p>Man this is just too easy. Do you not realize what sub you’re in? This <em>IS</em> literally an echo chamber of like-minded anti-masker, covid-hoaxer conspiracy theorists that have a surface level understanding of science. </p>
<p>I’m not going to get into it anymore with you, or anyone else here really, cause I understand this is your safe space and if you guys lack the capacity to understand this from experts (field experts, not me), then there’s no way in hell I’m going to get through to you. Just remember, you claimed people that believe in science and experts are unintelligible and can’t think critically. You are someone that thinks seeing the a particular number means big things are going to happen. </p>
<p>The only thing more dangerous than a lack of knowledge, is an illusion of knowledge. Luckily, there’s only a few people like you.</p>

        <p>Dude I would love to discuss this stuff on r/news or r/politics or any other mainstream subreddit. The reason we have to post on this subreddit, is because we're being censored for questioning the pandemic, for posting inconvenient facts, and for calling for a stop to the New Normal. This isn't a vacuum chamber by choice, we're literally being persecuted for voicing dissent to government mandates. That don't sound fucked to you?</p>

        <p>try to keep up, the 'old normal' is gone forever, destroyed by tyrannical dictates in the name of 'health and safety'. and all too easily it was done, child's play when you think about it.</p>

        <p>Yes, I am aware, but the US destroyed their institutions, army and any viability they had as a polis. They are the same ones that set up Lenin, Hitler, Mao and other despots. Have you noticed that they lose continually? Their big plan before was to take over the world military and implement global eugenics which failed. </p>
<p>Now theyve moved to subversion tactics and soft kill weapons. Its only as effective as its novelty and the publics ability to not resist or comprehend tyranny in plain site. Once people begin to comprehend this type of attack, they have nothing.</p>

        <p>doesn't look like they are losing continuously to me. </p>
<p>i see no one of account resisting the tyranny of these 'government health measures' </p>

<p>if people aren't awake by now, they never will be.</p>
<p>the vast and overwhelming percentage of people are statists, they simply vary by degree and type of statist they support.</p>

        <p>Plenty of churches, restraunts, and other places of businesses resisting shutdown orders. There was even a march in CA from business owners against the mandates, many of whom are normie-types. This is only one example. But there are others if you look for em, and yes, they are harder to find but they are there. </p>
<p>The media only publicizes that which makes the enemy look strong and invincible. They give the illusion of widespread popular support to make people demoralized and the situation appear hopeless. This is another tactic to sap morale because even if you are aware of their schemes, your fighting will is sapped before the real battle starts. A large portion of reddit are bots for this reason alone. </p>
<p>Im not saying there is not a long, arduous, and bloody road ahead. But in the end, they will lose, because they always lose. Hang tough and strengthen your will because we're just getting started and I wanna see you on the front lines (metaphorically)</p>

        <p>Yes, I feel the same. Every act of defiance to tyranny, however small, has the power to give hope to hundreds, thousands, and even millions. </p>
<p>Those sheeple that are going along with the lockdowns are the same sheeple that are gonna act like they were always against the lockdowns and were patriots when humanity finally wakes up and bucks this NWO system. </p>
<p>Same as the Nazis. Not a single German from that time will admit they were totally on board with Hitlers program. They went along with it cuz it was easy and appeared popular, then once they lost, magically, suddenly everyone said they were against it the entire time.</p>

        <p>Magna Carta was contested by the absolute monarchy of England, they failed, start of tradition of limited government in the west.</p>
<p>American Revolution they try to make America into a client state with no representation while taxing everything. They fail, America declares independence British monarchy ousted. </p>
<p>French Revolution banker/merchant class tries to keep population in perpetual wage slavery, while puppeteering the French monarchy, they fail. </p>
<p>They try to suck all the wealth out of India with East India Company, eventually, they fail, India is an indpendent nation. </p>
<p>They put Lenin in and funded the communist revolution, we had a cold war, they fought for a while then they failed, soviet communism dissolved. </p>
<p>British intelligence put Hitler in to run a global eugenics operation and institute a one world government using German military and technology, they fail.  </p>
<p>There are many more examples of tyrants attempting fantastic schemes to rule the entire world, being successful for a time, then dissolving. The only difference now is the method of attack and the specific groups executing them.</p>

        <p>Put it this way: some of the most advanced and unfortunately immoral thinkers in the fields of psychology, warfare, and technology have been working for centuries to figure out how to best control the minds of the people. Little by little they became more effective until we got to this point. People didn’t just drink the kool-aid this time, they chugged it. There are so many factors why: people gradually becoming dumbed down, destruction of families, advancement of social media, etc. But they didn’t get everyone and a fuck load of people see right through all. It’s making a lot of people question the nature of reality as they once knew it.</p>

<p>I cannot blame people for tuning into CNN, Fox or some rinky-dink local news station, seeing the pictures of people who just a week before were going around their lives as normal and then CoVid-19 hits them and BOOM: Ventilated and with a 4 out of 5 chance of dying!</p>
<p>It does not matter that some of those people were slightly overweight or had slight health issues... everyone knows that everyone has one or more of those issues in the United States that can lead to CoVid-19 deciding "Hey... I'mma gunna KEEEEEL yer ass!"</p>

        <p>Sorry, I’m not really sure what you mean by this. Are you an advocate of drinking and driving? Do you enjoy compromising the safety of the people around you? Are you trying to scare me? Your reply is very unhelpful.</p>

        <p>People have to learn how to say no to authority. We just all need to say no sorry not doing it. In my state at least 1,000 restaurants are staying open despite shutdown. I went to a bar that had a big party and salsa dancing. People have to learn how to be independent and not do what they are told.</p>
