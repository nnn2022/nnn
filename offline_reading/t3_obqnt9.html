    <strong>With Mask Mandates Gone, Make It Illegal To Post Covid19 Signs</strong>
    <p><p>With Mask Mandates Gone, Make It Illegal To Post Covid19 Signs in Windows of Stores and Businesses</p>
<p>Why? Because 'follow the science', and 'follow the lead of your Provincial Health Officer'.</p>
<p>The Mask needs to go, and businesses need to stop their constant and ongoing trampling of people's human rights and freedoms, especially of those of us, the majority who are free and perfectly healthy people of Canada.</p>
<p>"But Prisoner! Businesses have a right to make you wear a toilet seat around your neck if they want to!"</p>
<p>FALSE.</p>
<p>Property Law only affords them 'the right to refuse service for any reason'.</p>
<p>The only thing that would change, is that they could no longer use The Mask or any other requirement as an excuse to refuse service to you. At this point, with no ongoing mandate, ONE could make a case then, that they are now DISCRIMINATING, and really only based on FEAR and SUSPICION at this point if they continue.</p>
<p>This way.. they would literally have to to tell me "I am refusing your service just because I want to" and they can no longer hide behind a Mask policy or mandate or anything else - and expose them for the biased, politically-based moneygrubbers they are.</p>
<p>For too long have businesses and employers shucked their responsibility to adequately protect their employees, with whatever it takes - shields, masks, partitions, full body suits - and instead put it on the rest of us, creating a 'witch hunt' mentality and criminalizing perfectly healthy Citizens.</p>
<p>Kick me out if you want.. But now you have no valid reason to, and now  you can't feel emboldened to ask me medical questions anymore.</p>
<p>Guaranteed if these signs could no longer be used after a mandate is gone, we will see opening up much faster, and we will have other stores open up, giving them competition, and this will all be over soon.</p>
<p>Where am I wrong?</p></p>

        <p>Never in the history of society has enacting more laws and limitations helped in the long run. I wholeheartedly support the sentiment, but laws only ever exist to limit your liberties.</p>

        <p>Well I'm not asking for a new law, but rather not enabling a business to put up signs that would rationalize them abusing the Law any further.</p>
<p>Perhaps I worded it wrong, as I would rather REMOVE things that are trampling on people's rights, while still respecting the rights of the business.</p>
<p>So basically, they can still remove me for any reason, but they just won't be able to use a covid19 excuse, etc anymore - they'll just have to show they are dicks for discrimination.</p>

        <p>Guys it’s a trick…they’re going to bring the masks back and even make you wear them outside or the UN police will beat you to death in the street to show others what an obedient bitch does or he gets the boot stamping on his face.</p>
