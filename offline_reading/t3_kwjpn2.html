    <strong>More restrictions to come in Spain and I'm just done</strong>
    <p><p>I'm just so done. In my country we've had a curfew since October, we haven't been able to move outside our town at all until pretty recently for Christmas, and now they want to yet again restrict that movements so we can't move where we want. 
I still don't have a job, I spent my birthday alone as my girlfriend isn't from my town, Christmas have been anything but Christmas and now they want to restrict again the movements and make an even more restrict curfew. And fucking people are saying it's still not enough, we should completely lockdown to prevent a fourth wave from happening. I'm going crazy, how can anybody beg to get their freedom taken even more harshly just like that? How can be anything like that helpful for a flu-like virus? And seriously we're talking now about a fourth wave? There's going to be at this rate more waves than on a fucking ocean ffs!</p>
<p>I just want to have a job, be able to see my girlfriend and be able to afford to live on my own. I don't want to live forever with my parents, yet employment wasn't good here even before the virus and now it's just way, way worse. I feel they are destroying my future, our future as I'm not the only one being affected by this... and fucking people celebrate it and want even more restrictions! The same people that supposedly push caring for others, fucking hypocrites!</p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to vent my feelings a bit, it's close to a year by now since all this nonsense started and I've yet to see an end to this and this is just too depressing and horrible. Thanks God there's at least this place, it's pretty much not allowed to even think of questioning our mighty lord the Government and the China flu elsewhere.</p></p>

        <p>Holy shit mate, i just relate to this 100%. It's the EXACT same situation for me here in Greece, we have curfew since October and our govt did not even remove it for Christmas. I'm unemployed and my future is being destroyed in front of my eyes. Also i'm losing the best years of my life living in misery and loneliness.</p>

        <p>Damn, I'm really sorry the situation is the same there, I do not wish this kind of torture to anybody. Here we also had curfew even during Christmas. They had a bit of a lighter curfew only for Christmas' Eve and New Year's but it added like maybe two hours. It's just insane honestly. 
Before all this I had depression for years, and when I was actually feeling I was achieving something and starting to build my life, this shit happens. The loneliness of the lockdowns is really awful and videocalls aren't just the same. I really hope one way or another we can end this madness sooner than later. Stay strong!</p>

        <p>People always see increasing "security" measures as a bad thing here. And I don't think it is. One of the best things that can happen is they increase the tyranny too much, too fast, and people flip out. It's when they slowly ramp up these measures that they fuck us hardest, because people get used to it. Fast tyranny is best tyranny, as far as I'm concerned.</p>

        <p>Same in Romania, we've been under curfew and mandatory masks even outside since October. Sometimes I wish people in my country were as brave and dedicated to their freedom like Americans are. We forgot about the communist dictatorship so fast...</p>

        <p>That's horrible, here we also have mandatory masks even outside since almost when this started in Spring last year. It doesn't make sense and I started wearing them bad on purpose most of the time. Your country is not alone on that sadly, we gave our freedom quite easily. I just hope, eventually all this will have to end, and hopefully not in a bad way.</p>

        <p>That's true we avoided a complete total lockdown, in comparison with much of Europe to my knowledge. But let's see how much it lasts, people are definitely pushing for a total one for some reason. 
It may not be much, but I appreciate your kind words :)</p>
