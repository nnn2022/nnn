    <strong>The British subservience to the government is disgusting!</strong>
    <p><p>The British seem like a bunch of desperate beggars, accepting every rule that our power-drunk government issues. It's bad enough that we've got those idiots infantilizing us and deciding our holiday plans for us, but on top of that, I notice that most people around me are more than willing to pay hundreds of pounds in COVID swabs (yes, the ones that were found to be unreliable), go on quarantine even if you're vaccinated/had COVID (yes, the one where you pay thousands of pounds for your hotel for  14 days) and wear a face mask inside a plane for hours (pointless + torture). </p>
<p>What is wrong with you people?! I don't care who you have to visit in another country, what your international  professional commitments are or how long it has been since you've gone on a decent vacation. Every time you comply with this shit you're re-enforcing it and making it harder for us to ever regain our rights. </p>
<p>I too love to travel and there's a million other reasons why I should be travelling, but I'm not. I would lose all self-respect if I were to engage in any of the above-mentioned idiotic travelling-related procedures. </p>
<p>I guarantee you: if enough people stop travelling altogether, the pressure over the government from companies, airlines, tourism-related activities and people in general will be huge. Do not comply!</p></p>

        <p>They are cucks, one of the best and most powerful countries now in full decline. Imagine giving your life in WW2 just for all your efforts to be easily given away by cucked morons.</p>

        <p>I feel you my friend. I'm doing my best but am surrounded by cucks...in the supermarket I'm pretty much always the only one without a nappy on my face. I've written my MP many times, written to the PM, contributed a massive essay to the vaccine passport committee and have helped a few people see there's something fishy going on.</p>
<p>Sadly the number of cucks here is overwhelming.</p>

        <p>It is demoralising when the cucks outnumber you 1000 to 1 but well done for taking action</p>
