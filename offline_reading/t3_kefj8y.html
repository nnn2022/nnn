    <strong>The simplest way to end the panic</strong>
    <p><p>Give blood, get an instant antibody test, and if you're immune, you don't need to worry about any vaccine. Where I live, the easiest way is through LifeStream, <a href="https://www.lstream.org/">https://www.lstream.org/</a>. Not only are people desperately in need of blood donations; society desperately needs more people to take antibody tests. The system discourages it and wants you to believe you can be re-infected, but they're lying and you know it.</p>
<p>The one catch is that they will ask you if you've come into contact with anyone recently who's had the virus. Just say no. They will prohibit you from giving blood if you say yes.</p>
<p>I encourage you to donate blood and then share on social media. The more people who pass antibody tests, the sooner we can all feel comfortable getting back to normal.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'd also say that it's healthier to maintain some exposure to it even after testing positive for antibodies. The powers that be would be content with us taking PCR tests every two weeks for the rest of our lives. They do not want you to know that truth, which is that once you've contracted the virus and recovered, every virus you inhale is far more likely to help develop antibodies than it is to re-infect you.</p>
<p>A friend who works at a diagnostic lab got it months ago and hasn't been re-infected. To the contrary, his antibody count is now through the roof, probably from all the people he comes in contact with testing. He's also made a habit of avoiding masks wherever possible - that can't hurt either. It reminds me of a doctor who privately said that she hasn't been tested and feels safer coming into contact with it every day at work, since she believes it helps her build immunity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I tested positive for antibodies yesterday, and I've declared victory to my friends and family. Let's beat this thing together through the only way that's worked in history - live your life, catch it, recover, and declare victory one life at a time.</p>

        <p>Yeah, and I actually went and practiced what I preached by caring for my father when he caught it, catching it myself, and recovering.</p>
<p>Anyone advocating for lockdowns should be willing to give up their own job. If you're not willing, I don't see how you're not being a complete hypocrite by claiming to care about the poor.</p>
