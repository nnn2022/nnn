        <p>Here's a hospital director's blog from <strong>2017</strong> talking about ideal hospital occupancy rate:</p>
<p><a href="http://hospitalmedicaldirector.com/what-is-the-ideal-hospital-occupancy-rate/">http://hospitalmedicaldirector.com/what-is-the-ideal-hospital-occupancy-rate/</a></p>
<p>As it turns out, hospitals run like a business, and they intentionally don't have a lot of surplus in terms of space. It would go unused. Hospitals often target 85% occupancy, but it's normal to hit and even surpass 100%.</p>
<p>TV news doesn't give this perspective.</p>
<p>They also didn't tell us about the mid-century population boom which was actually global. It began 80 years ago and lasted 20-25 years. Life expectancy is \~79 years...</p>
<p>80 years after a population boom, you're doing to have a death boom. It's just a fact of life.</p>
<p>But if you KNOW that's going to happen you can take advantage of the information and use it to scare people. Scared people do what you want. Fear short-circuitys logic and reason.</p>
<p>At this point, people who don't see this for what it is are willingly blind. I don't advise engaging with them online -- their presence is disingenuous and they will just waste your time. Downvote and move on.</p>

        <p>I was a housekeeper for one of the largest hospitals East of Ohio 3 years ago and I worked multiple floors, each and their own designation for each patient depending on the category of their health. After 3:30PM EST was when it usually got the busiest and had to begin to start cleaning rooms to prep for new patients to come in the very next day. All of the patient rooms throughout the entirety of the hospital were always full. Even had some patients in the ED/ER sit in hallways with chairs, and some the hard and cold tile floors.</p>

        <p>Sure! Everything you see on TV news is true and they aren't censoring different opinions so you don't hear them.

        <p>No, I don't watch TV so I don't see anything there. There are however some institutions that I think should be trusted, as long as they don't have absolute power over their domain (like CCP) or are in other ways immune to scrutiny and criticism. </p>
<p>Sure there are experts that are wrong all the time, that doesn't matter though, it's the consensus that matters.</p>
<p>The consensus might even be wrong or a bit off the mark sometimes but you and I are definitely not the ones who figure that out.</p>
<p>Also, my country had strict lockdowns so we don't have covid right now and the vaccinations will probably make heard immunity before another wave can form.</p>

        <p>Oh my god... The lockdowns, the business closures -- these have nothing to do with a virus.</p>
<p>This is the government doing test runs for the financial crisis which is about to unfold. To see how people react to business closures (and now gas shortages in the US.)</p>
<p>It's an opportunity to test UBI and see what kind of effect that has on the economy, and how it affects people's willingness to work.</p>
<p>If you think this is about a virus you really need to turn off your screens. Unplug. Get away from the internet long enough that you can get out of the hypnosis and <em>think</em>.</p>
<p>We are facing a global financial crisis and governments have used the last year to prepare. </p>
<p>"Defund the police" was cover for bolstering the police because there will be mass  protests when the global debt crisis unwinds. That's what the lockdowns are for.</p>
<p>You didn't notice that the virus is based on a seasonal illness which just happens to occur at the same time market meltdowns happens? (September/October)</p>
<p>You didn't notice the US Fed intervention in the repo markets in September 2019, just like before the 2008 Financial Crisis?</p>
<p>You didn't notice the executive order two days after - EO 13887 which paved the way for accelerated vaccines and the Covid-19 Task Force long before Covid was a thing?</p>
<p>I'm sure you knew about "Event 201" but did you just accept fact-checker website nonsense or did you actually watch it?</p>
<p>Sigh... Unplug and <em>think</em>. If you believe what's happening relates to a virus, you are deeply hypnotized.</p>

        <p>A death boom that kicks off from nothing in a matter of months worldwide, but happening in different cities, states, countries and regions at different times.<br>
And a death boom that also suddenly skews symptoms and causes of death?<br>
But the numbers only really work for the US. Other western countries have longer life expectancies. The UK has almost three years longer life expectancy, why did their death boom happen almost at the same time?
Norway, Sweden and Denmark have remarkably similar population structures and life expectancies. Why did Sweden have a much larger death boom than its neighbors?</p>
<p>This nutty theory doesn't work at all.</p>

        <p>The virtue signaling for the vaccine is honestly the worst. I work in a hospital and the amount of medical professionals that straight up said no to the vaccine and threatened to quit if they were forced was astounding. Don't get this fucking vaccine. I used to say get it if you are scared, but honestly it's a pointless shot that does not work as intended. Stay away.</p>

        <p>This discussion is not over yet, there are several things to discuss such as that there is data that suggests vaccinated emit less virus if they do get infected. And on the other hand, there is an ethical debate about wether or not vaccinated people should get more freedoms or wether they should be solidary with unvaccinated and wait until there's less infections. I probably won't convince you, and I'm not sure about this topic myself, so let's just end this debate here. </p>

<p>If I don't exhibit any symptoms of a disease, I'm not able to spread that disease. The doctor is going to give me funny looks if they ask me what symptoms I have and I tell them I have none. I can't believe we even need to have this conversation in the current year, but that's to be expected with the level of brainwashing going on.  </p>
<p>Oh, and remember: We're talking about a disease that carries with it a 99% chance of survival across most age groups. Yeah, so scary.</p>

        <p>What you said is just straight up wrong. There is no such general rule that one has to show symptoms of a disease in order to be able to infect others. </p>
<p>Take chickenpox for example. It is infectious one to two days before the rash shows, according to this CDC sheet: https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/hcp/index.html</p>
<p>Or take HIV. After the first phase of infection with flu-like symptoms, patients have no symptoms at all for years, all the while still being infectious and spreading the virus. The long symptom-free, but contagious interval is one of the reasons why the AIDS pandemic is so hard to fight. </p>
<p>There might be some diseases where the patient is not contagious until he/she develops symptoms, but there is no general rule that says so.</p>

        <p>1% of a hell lot is still a lot. Covid has already killed 582k in the US alone, compared to about 400k US casualties in WW2. That's as if for half a year, the 9/11 attacks had happened every day.</p>

        <p>Over-inflated death stats (e.g. - someone testing positive with a shady testing protocol after dying in a motorcycle crash isn't 'death from COVID'). Also, there's been no increase in overall global mortality compared to the last 10 years. Try again.</p>

<p>the decision not to get jabbed with EUA experimental gene therapy mystery juice is fully up to the discretion of the individual. fit and healthy people would be taking on more risk by getting a jab, vs not getting a jab. </p>

<p>both healthy and unhealthy people (but the latter group especially) must consider that the jab could very well kill or otherwise permanently harm them. instead of taking drugs, they should take responsibility for their health and life, and look after themselves. healthy people opting out is the opposite of braindead - you clearly don’t understand the risk profiles associated with c19.</p>

        <p>She's a disgusting fatbody. She is objectively less attractive and less healthy than the two on the left. And she just has the look of an annoying bitch. I wouldn't walk up to her and browbeat her for it or anything. She'd just blend in with all the other fat slags out and about. One good thing about masks is that I don't need to be exposed to pug-ugly mugs when I'm out for a run or a ride.</p>
