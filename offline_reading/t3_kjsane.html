    <strong>Something I've noticed</strong>
    <p><p>Something I have come to notice over the course of this "pandemic" are the type of people more likely to wear a mask and allow themselves to be dictated by FEAR. Either while shopping for groceries or going out to dine and even among my own family, I have consistently seen Black people ignore or disregard the Covid-19 guidelines set either by the authorities or businesses. The other day while at the gas station I walked in (without a mask on) and as I got up to the counter the white female cashier asked me to wear a face mask as per guidelines. I refused siting my constitutional rights. Then another employee from the backroom came up ( a black man) and said he would help me instead. I purchased my things and made short conversation with him and we both talked about how stupid this whole mask thing was. He did have a mask on but he was trying to keep it bellow his nose and mouth as much as possible or as I like to call it stealth masking.</p>
<p>Essentially what I'm getting at is that its nice to see the descendants of formers slaves realize how precious our freedoms are and wont let them be taken away so easily.</p></p>

        <p>I've actually been noticing the opposite in the city. They're the ones wearing the masks while driving and walking alone. I notice this daily on my drive to work. </p>
<p>I'm really glad to hear it's not the norm everywhere.</p>

        <p>That's interesting, I guess I can only speak for around LA county though. And while I have seen less mask usage among Blacks its not all of them. But I do feel like there is a difference in mask usage among different races or ethnicities.</p>

        <p>I'm east coast. Northern. My coworker is a black man and I brought it up to him. I tell him how I feel about that and everything in general and he seems to agree with me. But then when he speaks about his feelings, he wears his mask everywhere and stays socially distant. He avoids get togethers with family as much as possible. So I guess he's just in the middle. Not a doomer, but not exactly awake to the reality of things. Overall, it seems people here are just going with things and not making a fuss one way or the other.</p>

        <p>This is a similar feeling I get with a lot of people regardless of race. They don't like all of these restrictions and rules but are too afraid of speaking out. My hope is that as this goes on people will begin speaking out more but I thought that would have been the case months ago. Hopefully things will change for the better.</p>

        <p>I have also often wondered what are the common factors among the believers vs non-believers of this scamdemic. </p>
<p>Some of my different general observations:</p>
<p>People from small towns (either living in one now, or grew up in one)</p>
<p>People with several siblings rather than  none or just one.</p>
<p>People who’ve been involved in some type of abusive relationship.</p>
<p>People living below the poverty level</p>
<p>Set me straight if I’m way off, but having at least one of those factors seems more likely to make a person more of a realist and skeptic, and not buying into the narrative.</p>
<p>Just my personal observations, but can’t explain why these factors would make this difference.</p>

        <p>When you attribute certain traits to race, that is racism.
Who are the leaders you talk about? It seems to me like anti-mask people lump all hegemonies into one big “they” and call it a day. Frankly, it’s pretty paranoid rhetoric. Intellectual leaders and scientific leaders often oppose government, generally against their own financial gain. When you categorically oppose ideas without thinking critically about the ideas themselves, you are an idiot.</p>
