    <strong>*Call to action* I'm so sick of the hysteria and the weakness.</strong>
    <p><p>Back in march it was understandable to say "people are scared" when explaining erratic or violent behaviour towards dissent.</p>
<p>We've had almost a year to figure it out now, and imo anyone who hasn't is weak and, ultimately, incapable of critical thought. Mainstream media outlets have between them published more than enough info to dissolve their own narratives. </p>
<p>While I would never expect anyone to be convinced by anything I say (who the fuck am I to be believed?) I can't help but be angry at those that practice fascism without even realising it, while claiming to be 'liberal' or 'progressive'.</p>
<p>The same applies to me. I am reacting in a way that's desirable for the elite by posting on reddit instead of mobilising and acting on what I've seen/heard/decided. </p>
<p>I really want to make some changes and make some movements.</p>
<p>Anyone serious about action in the UK please contact me.</p></p>

        <p>Back in March I knew exactly how this whole fiasco will evolve. With constant lockdowns, house arrests, facemasks all of which cause health issues. What you see happening is a war against human existence.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean... even people who apparently don’t agree with this aren’t much better. I set up a leaflet making group- the idea was to each make a leaflet exposing covid lies/ lockdown etc and post them up around town and through people’s letter boxes. I was the only one who made a leaflet- people just cannot be bothered with even the easiest tasks.</p>
