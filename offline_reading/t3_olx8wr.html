        <p>At this point all the evidence goes in one direction - the  v a x  is the bioweapon.</p>
<p>They've started the pandemic by using false information and fear in order to make the people take the real bioweapon - the v a x</p>
<p>Holy fuck.</p>
<p>u/Glen_Myers  bro, you can make incredible positive change by releasing the data much sooner. Please think about what I've wrote above and the fact that people lack data well put together. There IS already momentum right now in France in Greece. They could share the data if they will have it. Just imagine.</p>

        <p>They have basically put us in a corner, with the system they've build, and now by limiting of food basically if we don't take the jab.</p>
<p>We got to admit, that's the wrong choice we made in the first place, to depend on this very system build by them for shelter and food.</p>
<p>But I understand, this is the situation now, and like you said, they are forcing and people are willing to take it because - job (meaning shelter and food).</p>
<p>The only two hope it's mass push-over. Or moving outside of city and somehow shelter and depend on God system of food...</p>
<p>They have tricked us for sure with this system they build. </p>
<p>Stay strong bro, I pray to God to give strength to you and your people and all people around world to fight for the good cause.</p>

        <p>&rt;. and these are just the ones being posted about</p>
<p>How about all the people who haven't experienced any effect? This is an example of survivor bias, where only the examples fitting your description constitue the observation, without taking into account all the vaccinated people, which is a huge number.
I don't want to discredit these first hand experiences, but pointing out worst cases of vaccinations needs to be compared to pointing out worst cases of infections.</p>
