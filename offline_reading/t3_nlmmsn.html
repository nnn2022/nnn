    <strong>Sacrificing the 99+% for the 0.01%</strong>
    <p><p>The whole lockdown ordeal makes no sense. Why sacrifice the lives and livelihoods of the 99%+ for the lives of the 0.01%? </p>
<p>It’s just not fair. So many jobs have been lost, so many abused children are stuck in dangerous situations without an escape. If I was a kid again, I don’t know what I’d do. I came from an abusive home myself and my heart aches for all the kids right now. </p>
<p>Fear has been used to manipulate the population so much that people have no objectivity anymore. People don’t understand properly weighing benefits vs cons anymore. </p>
<p>All of the privileged work from home, watch tv and eat doordash whilst the less privileged have lost their jobs and struggle to put food on the table. Fuck all the assholes who thought this was all necessary. </p>
<p>So many people are suffering right now for so little. </p>
<p>Totalitarian control has been used to strike so much fear. The masks, the 6 feet apart. </p>
<p>Yeah sure, we should stay away from those who have an actual flu or sickness, but fearing anyone and everyone is some sort of walking bioweapon is ridiculous. </p>
<p>I feel for the kids in this pandemic who won’t see faces in public and are being deprived of the socialization they vitally need. I was deprived of normal socialization for years by my mother, and it took a very long time to recover. I can’t imagine  the kids during this who can’t play or talk to their peers.</p></p>

        <p>And that 0.01% are people who have either already lived well up to the average life span OR have lived for 40 years not giving a damn about their health and were bound to die sooner than later. All of a sudden people act like 90 year olds and 300lbs individuals with multiple health problems have never died before and need to be <em>saved</em>. This isn't a disease that is wiping out people indiscriminately and most who have had will remember it as the worst flu of their life and nothing more. </p>
<p>I am lucky to be one of the "privileged" who gets to work from home and order doordash and while it's not my cup of tea I have to admit it's a comfortable lifestyle and can see why the lazy antisocial ones are terrified of losing it. It's absolutely vile that they go around pretending they care about "saving lives" and have audacity to call us "selfish" for wanting people to get their jobs back and have food on their table or wanting kids to have a normal childhood and development.</p>
