    <strong>Re-instating mask mandates serves the purpose to turn more people against us</strong>
    <p><p>By punishing those who complied, it generates more anger against the scapegoat, us. Another successful psychological maneuver. Has absolutely nothing to do with cases rising. </p>
<p>As much as we like to think they will come to their senses after getting duped, the real message being communicated is "the unvaxxed are stealing your freedom". </p>
<p>"You will suffer the consequences until you have assumed full tyranny over the unvaxxed"</p>
<p>I feel like I'm crazy watching all these Nazi-level psychological attacks to de-humanize us who choose to wait until proper vax testing is complete.</p></p>

<p>He was ill. Couldn't hardly breathe. Looked miserable. I assume I finally ran into the first person ever with covid. No idea for sure, but thats the first time I kinda wished I was wearing a mask. Idk. See how things go</p>

        <p>You make it my business by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Placing yourself on a soapbox crying about how the government is taking away your rights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prolonging the global pandemic: damaging the economy, my personal life and the life of everyone around me. This is because COVID regulations at this point are meant to protect people like you, as well as immunocompromised people that aren’t well protected/are unable to take the vaccine. And it’s frustrating seeing people still afraid of the vaccine that’s statistically many more times safer than getting COVID after literal billions have been administered the vaccine. But whatever, if you want to wait for full FDA approval, then suit yourself. I personally think it’s immoral to do so without wearing a mask, but you might not, and you’re allowed to, welcome to America. I hope that people actually get the vaccine when full fda approval hits though, and this magnetic nonsense is minimal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s frustrating as fuck seeing thousands of people unnecessarily die from covid thanks to vaccine hesitancy, and it’s even more frustrating having to get more government mandates to protect them. And that’s why people are angry. You’re not the scapegoat, you’re the problem, and you chose to do so. Stop being a fucking victim</p>
<p>You also seem to think I want people brainwashed by this killed or hurt in some way. Dunno why you think that</p>

        <p>China damaged your personal life. The people behind the scenes responsible for creating the virus damaged your personal life. You’re just too stupid and gullible to see that so you blame it on people just like you who didn’t ask for this either. Your vaccine doesn’t work. It failed, you failed, your logic failed, you made a mistake, and now you want the rest of the world to pay for it. Thanks for doing your part to make tyranny a reality.</p>

        <p>I don’t understand how the vaccine failed? Over 99% of recent COVID cases are from unvaccinated individuals. How is that a failure?</p>
<p>If China manufactured the virus, then they did something horrible that did indeed affect my life. I personally don’t believe they did, but if reliable, credible information cited that it does, so be it. That doesn’t change the fact that anti-vacc is prolonging the pandemic.</p>
<p>Also where’s the tyranny? I really can’t seem to find it. Mask mandates are state level, not federal. Just leave your state if you don’t like them, no?</p>

        <p>You seriously believe the 99% number? The one the media repeats every single day that is completely static and unchanged regardless of how many breakthrough cases are reported? You think they happen to be exactly 99%, the same number they advertise on germ killing wipes? I can’t help you. If you can’t see the tyranny, I also can’t help you.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry but if that’s the level of conspiracy that you believe, I can’t say anything you disagree with without you calling it fake news. The only way to make up that vaccines are effective when they actually aren’t is if the ENTIRE WORLD collectively lied about covid data with vaccinations.</p>

        <p>If you’ve been paying attention to the news you would SEE that they aren’t effective. It’s been 6 months and they are already failing against the delta variant and mask mandates are going back up. But good job for doing your part to get back to “normal”.</p>
