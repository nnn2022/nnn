    <strong>School and future plans hindered. Sick of covid ruining my future.</strong>
    <p><p>For reference, I'm in Cumbria, England, and I'm in my 1st year of 6th form (year 12). I have no idea what the American equivalent is, I'm 17. Basically, I don't have to go to 'school' in a traditional sense anymore, at this age, I could be working, or learning a trade, but before this madness hit, I wanted to work at Sellafield with some kind of science background, or be a dental hygienist, or some kind of medical proffessional. My plans have been turned upside down- Uni isn't worth going to if all the classes will be online.</p>
<p>So far, my sleep schedule is already fucked. I slept through all my online classes today, teachers are vague about what they want us to do, and my best friend in school says barely anyone logs on anyway. I understand homwork, but personally, home isn't a place I can focus very well on school work, I used to be hooked on amphetamines to pass my exams but my dealer stopped selling so I'm fucked.</p>
<p>I have 0 motivation, because of the lockdown. I'd rather smoke weed all day and watch dragon ball, online classes don't even happen half the time they just send an email with a bunch of work. How am I meant to carry on til the Feb half term like this ? It's hard for me, I can't even imagine what it's like for students from poorer households with little access to technology, I'm lucky that my family has a laptop I can do this stuff on, but what about the people who only own a phone or have no printer ?</p>
<p>To top it all off, my final exams are meant to be taking place next year- and I don't know if they're getting cancelled. If they aren't, I'm missing a sizeable chunk of the 1st year of my course. It's all bollocks. I'm passionate about science- it really is going to hurt me a lot if I'm forced to change direction because of this political turmoil.</p>
<p>3 days in, and my mental health is going to shit, I'm losing all the motivation I had to go out and still meet people because everyone's scared of the police catching them outside, even if they believe the virus itself is bullshit. I'm sick of the futures of myself, and my peers being turned tits up because poeople won't speak out against this tyranny. I want to go to school, not listen to pre-recorded power points.</p></p>

        <p>As an adult, I can tell you its all over rated, all of it. Hard work is not fulfilling, commuting sucks, paying bills,  all that junk. Enjoy the fact that you get a little bit of extra time to fuck around without the adults bitching at you to grow up. Smoke weed and play videos games all day. This shit isn't gonna last forever, no matter how many Alex Jones type salesman tell you it is, and when you're all grown up and your soul is crushed by late stage capitalism you'll look back fondly on that one year you only smoked weed and wasted time,  I promise that when you grow up you won't have that luxury.</p>

        <p>thanks for this response, it sure is more optimistic about the current situation. It's just shitty being forced to do online learning, with teachers threatening to kick me off the course when I have to take care of my brother and help my dad out around the house, I don't get to just sit around all day and I wish I still had a place to go to escape and socialize.</p>

        <p>In America, we just say 12th grade. It's the last year of regular schooling, the "senior year". It's very important to teens and has been ruined the last two school years. My condolences to you. Graduates aren't urged into trade apprenticeships here, they're urged into years of college debt. If they don't want to take out massive loans to do that, or fight tooth and nail for scholarships, they opt for military service so that they can afford it later. </p>
<p>Mine started 4th grade Monday and already today I had to keep him out for a sustained headache. He can't go back til he gets a negative covid test. We couldn't opt for virtual learning because we all work and he's not disciplined/mature enough to do it alone. Can't afford a tutor, but we do pay $40/day for him to go to a group setting on non school days. </p>
<p>I'm sorry your last year got ruined. I wish you the best in figuring out what to do from here. We're all going crazy trying to stay sane through this.</p>
