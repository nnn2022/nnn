        <p>I’m having this issue with some friends of mine. We have such a familial history but they won’t even let their parents see their new baby so I don’t hold much hope for me any time soon. I just have to partially mourn them and pray that eventually they can’t take it anymore and let me back in. We’ve been through too much and had too many good times for me to not reconnect with them if they ever choose to invite me back. But for now I have to somewhat emotionally remove myself from them due to their fear.</p>

        <p>I just want to know when these people think they will come out of hiding? Zero cases? Not gonna happen. Vaccine? Not gonna be any time soon, nor 100%. And there will always be a nasty old flu or something going around that could potentially kill grandma, so I guess nobody ever leaves the house again? I understood when it was about flattening the curve, but at this point I truly don’t get what people are waiting for.</p>

        <p>I honestly think people would get upset by the question since it forces them to think about what they’re doing and why. People don’t want to think they might have wasted months of their lives for nothing. I suspect “sunk cost” fallacy has something to do with it at this point. Since they already sacrificed almost six months, it seems like giving up to come out now. Like how people might say “no” to waiting in line for an hour, but if you say it’s going to be 15 minutes, then 30, they might just say “screw it, I already waited 30 minutes might as well wait another 30.” That’s the kind of psychology that’s been used by the government this whole time when this all started with the whole “two weeks” joke. I think many have also just gotten used to the hermit lifestyle. </p>
<p>Still, I’d like to know what people have to say, WITHOUT the drama.</p>

        <p>You’re correct.  People can’t reason their way out of a position they didn’t reason their way into.  Maybe some people will reflect a little and seriously think about what their end game is, but this is reddit so in reality the first few responses will probably be 0 new cases and everyone else will doubledown on the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Oh they'll come up with something. Yesterday I was discussing the moving of the goalposts with a doomer friend, and I asked her why she thinks this keeps happening and to what end?  And she said something along the lines of "It's the transmission rates! They're too high! This thing is like herpes!". I just rolled my eyes and gave up on talking to her.</p>

        <p>Honestly it’s just a thing of people will arbitrarily be scared until they’re not. My fiancé’s friends are all hardcore doomers and he’s just now hanging out with them in person again because they’ve decided that it’s safe now for some reason even though nothing has changed. I’ve learned that people have to come around on their own terms.</p>

        <p>I have done the same but for the opposite reason.  I tried to play nice but in early August I just couldn't handle dealing with scared, ignorant people anymore.  Now I'm functionally a hermit.  I haven't spoken to any of my friends since then and don't intend to.  I'm starting my first semester of grad school (figuring out how to navigate both learning and TA'ing remotely is just a bundle of fun, I assure you) and I intend to just hibernate until it's over and maybe by then life will be back to normal.  </p>
<p>But more likely it won't be and there'll be a mandatory vaccine waiting in the wings for me and I won't be able to get my PhD without taking it.</p>
