    <strong>Perspective.</strong>
    <p><p>Imagine we lived in a world where governments, politicians and big companies actually had our best interests. We could trust them and feel safe knowing we are all in this together working towards a better life. A real virus comes along naturally from some bat soup with no reason at all but accidental so we all work towards keeping each other safe. </p>
<p>Now imagine living in this safe little world and a group of people come along and start telling us we are being lied to by the people we trust and that our world is actually a scary fucked up place run by psychopaths that want to control and kill us. That our whole society is completely fabricated and NOTHING is for our best interest. </p>
<p>That would be pretty hard to grasp and scare most people shitless to even comprehend that they live in that world. People would fear this truth so much they’d actually fight for their safe fantasy world to be true without even considering the facts because deep down they know it’s true and are terrified. </p>
<p>We are the ones strong enough to carry this burden even while they attack us for only having everyone’s best interest. It is not Vaxxers vs Anti-vaxxers that’s how they keep us divided, it’s all of US vs the small group of Elites that our doing all this shit.</p>
<p>This is to have an understanding of people so we don’t get pulled down to their level. They are scared and not ready to open their eyes, does not mean they are evil or worth any less. If we keep retaliating we will always be stuck. </p>
<p>The ones using the pandemic to take full control can only do so as long as we let them. In a couple years from now we’ll be angry we didn’t do more but it could be too late. </p>
<p>Let’s end this shit now.</p></p>
