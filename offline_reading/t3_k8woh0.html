    <strong>How much more evidence do we need before we believe that the vaccine rollout is a plan to depopulate us? Playing into the climate change and the UN sustainability agenda, who can still look into Gates’ eyes and see anything but malevolence? (Third attempt to post now...)</strong>
    <p><p>1) Gates et al have been caught sterilising women with HCG during beta-runs in Kenya without the subjects’ knowledge or consent:</p>
<p>(links removed after failure to post on two occasions now)...plenty of info online...just search for UN+Vaccine+Kenya+sterilizing).</p>
<p>2) The spike protein in the new Pfizer vaccine:</p>
<p>“The vaccinations are expected to produce antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, spike proteins also contain <strong>syncytin-homologous proteins</strong>, which are essential for the formation of the placenta in mammals such as humans. It must be absolutely ruled out that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, as otherwise <strong>infertility of indefinite duration could result in vaccinated women</strong>.“</p>

<p>3) Gates even admitting that depopulation is his objective during the infamous TED talk:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAhLeF4R7q0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAhLeF4R7q0</a></p>
<p>4) The convenient omissions in the recipient information packs released by the U.K. government:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/k7tj7b/compare_the_uk_governments_information_pack_for/">https://np.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/k7tj7b/compare_the_uk_governments_information_pack_for/</a></p>
<p>...where they at least admit they do not know the effects on fertility the vaccine might have.</p>
<p>You might believe that the planet is genuinely overpopulated and is now beyond its caring capacity (I don’t) but to do this without our knowledge or consent is an abomination and simply criminal. Does anyone honestly believe Gates and his Rockefeller overlords have any less contempt for westerners than he does for Africans?</p>
<p>5) With European male fertility (sperm count, specifically) down 50% in fifty years, who will even notice or be able to apportion proper blame when the rest of us are unable to have children?</p>

No amount of facts, logic, or anything <em>you</em> present will help here. They will think everything is fine, right up until they fall into the meat grinder. Sad, but true.</p>

        <p>&rt;Do not take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Agree. The whole premise of injecting harmful chemicals directly into your bloodstream to increase your health doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;who can still look into Gates’ eyes and see anything but malevolence?</p>
<p>Gates is an actor reading out his script as all the politicians are, there to get the hate and anger projected upon. Do you think you get the actual people behind all this by a 30 second google search looking at page one?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;5) With European male fertility (sperm count, specifically) down 50% in  fifty years, who will even notice or be able to apportion proper blame  when the rest of us are unable to have children?</p>
<p>Taking this as an example, while the fertility rates of western countries are down, and deliberately so, don't forget to look in the other direction.</p>
<p>There is an even way more prevalent fertility agenda, and it's everywhere, so normalized you don't even consciously notice it any more.</p>
<p><strong>And why wouldn't there be one? They want to boss around and abuse slaves in the future as well, so of course they want them to procreate, they simply don't need or want as much of them as there are now.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And that's the main point: as normalized as it is, <strong>it's absolutely fucked up to force others unnecessarily into this fascist dystopian shithole, so they can be abused and exploited by a psychopathic ruling class as well</strong>. </p>
<p>Why would you want to do that to your children - instead of never exposing them to any harm at all? Don't gift the psychopaths in power new victims.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I'm starting to think even if this is true, it's fine.  None of us here are getting it anyway, so if this is true and it sterilizes, harms or kills a bunch of useless NPCs who literally begged for it, who cares?</p>
<p>No, the bigger issue will be when / if they try to coerce us into it by making it hard to participate in society which is my bigger worry.</p>

        <p>I love the way you all believe only you must be right. Yours is just an unconscious need to go against the flow, to feel different from everyone else.</p>
<p>Show me evidence, solid evidence. I won't trust a .wordpress.com free website just because it says exactly what you want to hear. I won't believe statements taken out of context so they fit your agenda. It doesn't work this way. Also, reddit comments from this same subreddit are not valid evidence </p>
<p>Now, to the TED thing. Gates stated that by giving people vaccines they will give the opportunity to have longer lifespans for those people. Vaccines will also allow children to get past the third year of life without fucking dieing cause of stupid diseases that are completely defeated in the first world thanks to the vaccines. If you, as a parent, know that most probably your child will die before even being 3 years old, you would make more children, this way you get chances to have older children higher, hence the very high natality in underdeveloped countries. But if you, as a parent, are almost 100% sure your child will live well and won't die cause of a stupid disease, you will make less children because the need to have "spare" children in case others die won't be there anymore. That's Gates' point. And you are just spreading disinformation, fake news and ignorance to more vulnerable people.</p>
