        <p>The majority of Americans, according to a recent survey, have canceled Thanksgiving and Christmas already.  I feel so bad for them being brainwashed like this I could cry.

        <p>I hate this. My sister are fed up and recently flew across the country to visit our family because we hadn’t seen them in almost a year. They are in their 60’s and our mom is so scared of the virus but our dad not so much. </p>
<p>They are extremely healthy hippie types but I thought, god forbid one of them has a heart attack or something and we never got to see them because we didn’t want to scare them with our ‘potentially infected’ selves? So we just decided to go (with their ok and a little help from me telling them how I get tested (negative always btw) fairly often for work). </p>
<p>We had a great time and GUESS WHAT?!?!? No one is sick. No one transmitted anything to anyone except hugs.  </p>
<p>So, Dr. Fauci, KNOCK IT OFF. Stop trying to scare people into depression and a life devoid of love and I hope you have fun eating a big ol’ bag of you-know-whats alone on Thanksgiving.</p>

        <p>I live in New Jersey, easily one of the worst states to live in right now under Tyrant Murphy’s totalitarian regime.  I have friends my own age telling me, “We all need to make sacrifices for our safety.  That means skipping Thanksgiving and Christmas and waiting till next year.”  One of my friends has left his home a grand total of 2 times since March 4th, once to get something super essential at the pharmacy and another for a hangout with a friend in the park where they sat so far away from each other they had to shout.  He is planning on staying home until the vaccine arrives.  This is so ridiculous and people are completely out of control.  When I said the other day at work that the businesses should start suing Gov. Murphy in the event he shuts them down again, my 25 year-old and healthy coworker looked at me as if I had just suggested killing puppies.  Pure stupidity, and I just can’t take it anymore.</p>

        <p>You’re so right, people are absolutely out fo control. People who use the buzzwords like they’ve always been part of their vernacular just sound so brainwashed to me; just repeating the same stuff they see and hear over and over like they’ve lost their minds. </p>
<p>This has also made me realize how many people are really scared of just getting sick. Like, not dying, just sick. It’s so weird. 
I offhandedly said to someone the other day that I don’t ever think or worry about getting sick, like it’s just not something that takes up much space in my brain, now or ever before. If I ever do, I deal with it. She looked at me like I was speaking a different language. </p>
<p>The reality is that anyone’s chances of catching this, let alone getting seriously ill from it are really low! But people act like the air outside is poison. Or that they might be contagious from just going to get their mail. Just...no! </p>
<p>I don’t know, we can’t live life in fear, man. You’ll miss out on so much irreplaceable stuff by living in fear, it’s just not worth it. </p>
<p>And I agree with you, I want to see lawsuits all over the place for this. I’m in CA, so I feel you big time. We’ve been absolutely bamboozled at this point by leadership and they should 1,000% be forced to own up to it.</p>

        <p>One of my good friends is so afraid, he does not take his mask off when it’s just the two of us in my apartment except if we’re eating, and then it goes right back on after that.  If we ever drive somewhere together, he insists that we both wear masks the entire time in the car, and yes, he does wear it outside at all times and gets annoyed with me if I don’t.  The other week, I suggested we go sit outside at a local bar, and he started visibly shaking and basically told me I was out of my mind for even making such a suggestion.  All of this from a healthy 22 year-old.</p>
<p>And you’re right.  To these people, there are 2 main facts that can’t be disputed: 1) This virus is floating in the air everywhere we go.  And 2) if and when you catch the virus, it’s instant death.  Absolutely nobody survives it.  And then when you try to show them the true facts, the majority of their responses is “Trump went in and edited the data to make himself look good so he can get reelected, to make up for handling it so poorly and costing thousands of American lives.”  They are a special kind of insane.</p>

        <p>That makes me so sad for your friend, and for you! He’s got so much ahead of him but at a young age now is afraid of the world. At 22 you should be having the time of your life, taking risks, living it up! </p>
<p>I hope that you, by being skeptical but clearly kind enough to be accommodating to him, can show him in little ways that the world isn’t as bad as he thinks.  The subtle approach takes longer,  but can help.</p>

        <p>It takes longer for sure.  I’ve texted back and forth with him a couple of times, but haven’t hung out with him at all in around 3 months just because I haven’t mustered up the energy too.  I’m not going to have somebody in my apartment who’s clearly terrified of even being there because of the minimal chance he’ll get COVID from me (if I even have it and am asymptomatic).  The last time we hung out, we went to the liquor store to get a 6-pack (I’m shocked he was even willing to go there), and the cashier’s mask was ever so slightly below their nose, so he took the beer right as the cashier was reaching for it to ring it up and went to another register.  That was pretty much the last straw for me for hanging out with him for some time.  Nothing against him, but I have enough stress In my life, so I don’t need the stress of him being so damn petrified.</p>
