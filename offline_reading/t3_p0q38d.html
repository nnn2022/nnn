    <strong>Hopefully I did not do my math incorrectly, or I will have to cry...</strong>
    <p><p>Have you heard of Herd immunity? "There are two main paths to herd immunity forÂ COVID-19Â â€” infection and vaccines." (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/herd-immunity-and-coronavirus/art-20486808)</p>
<p>There are approximately 7,900,000,000 people in the world, according to the world population meter. </p>
<p>203,402,678 cases of covid have been recorded as of today, August 8th,2021. </p>
<p>Approximately 4,400,000,000 people have been vaccinated, according to world data. </p>
<p>I am sure there is data to show how many of the 4.4 billion vaccinated actually had cov-2 previously, but I could not locate it. </p>
<p>Forrument sake, let's add the vaccinated and cov-2 cases together. This number is 4,603,402,678</p>
<p>If I did my math correctly, and I suck at math, 58.2709% of the world has either been vaccinated or contracted cov-2. In less than 2 years! This is actually an amazing number! </p>
<p>Now, the problem with this data is that we know people are still being infected with cov-2, even after the vaccination. There is not much, if any, reliable data of being reinfected after contracting cov-2 once. But much like other viruses, there is mutation and "break through" cases. So every bit of the "data" is up for debate. </p>
<p>There are several Coronaviruses that we have become immune to without vaccines. "Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s." (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html) </p>
<p>Do you know anything about epstein barr virus? 94% of the world's population has been exposed to this disease and have it in their system already. I, for example, came up positive for the antibodies this year. I got it when I was a teen and it caused mononucleosis. Most people does not get mononucleosis with epstein barr virus, just like most people have mild symptoms of covid. Mononucleosis would be the equivalent to "hard hitting covid" and like covid, there is a small death rate with mononucleosis. </p>
<p>There is actually a lower chance of death from CoV-2 than there is for mononucleosis, (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15056119/) and, "Results The combined global incidence of BL, HL, NPC and GC in 2017 was 1.442 million cases, withÂ over 973 000 deaths. An estimated 265 000 (18%) incident cases and 164 000 (17%) deaths were due to the EBV-attributed fraction. This is an increase of 36% in incidence and 19% in mortality from 1990." (https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/8/e037505). </p>
<p>Much like Covid (partial opinion ahead), "There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis. You can help protect yourself by not kissing or sharing drinks, food, or personal items, like toothbrushes, with people who have infectious mononucleosis." (https://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-mono.html#prevention). </p>
<p>These sources are from the same sources trying to sell how "deadly" CoV-2 is, so take this information as you will. </p>
<p>The same people, CDC, also did not recognize that "Chronic Lyme disease" existed. Then they changed their way of thinking after more than 300,000 cases popped up. (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/postlds/index.html). But for more than 30 years, they claimed it was impossible. The proper treatment of it still frowned on by the CDC, just like early Covid. Ivermectin is key! </p>
<p>There is a lot more information I can give you, if you are willing to listen, but I highly suggest looking into Dr John Ioannidis. He is one of the most published, respected and influential scientists in the world. He has been this way a lot longer than this pandemic has been around and he has 0 political agenda. Many people I have pointed to him finally started doing their own research and many have finally started to understand Virology, Epidemiology and our history with both. </p>
<p>I do hope you find this informative and please let me know if you have any other questions or comments. I am very open to hear it all! I stopped working in 2020, after my family contracted Covid, and decided to pour myself into both sides of the spectrum! I chose to keep political views out of my research as to not taint the truth, so to speak. </p>
<p>The way I do my research is not on Google, YouTube (though I have found many great videos on sourced material there) or any main stream media. I try to look at what the scientist's or physician's credibility looked like before this pandemic. For example, Dr. Anthony Fauci has been a disgrace for most of his career and most seasoned professionals have admitted this. However; somehow he is running the show.</p></p>

        <p>4 billion DOSES have been administered. That does not equal 4 billion people being vaccinated since several of the vaccines require 2 doses.</p>

        <p>Covid is not real, and there is no such thing as herd immunity. Stop promoting fake science, and misinformation. Sick of this shit. Fuckin absurd archaic pseudoscientific unproven nonsense.</p>
