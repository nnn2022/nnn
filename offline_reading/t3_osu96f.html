    <strong>Issues with this sub</strong>
    <p><p>Starting by saying that I like the idea of a place where people can share their ideas freely without fear of social media bans and cancel culture and all that shit.</p>
<p>However I find it disturbing how a chunk of this sub has become just a mirrored version of what it intended to fight against.</p>
<p>If you see some misinformation or point out where someone might be wrong, you're immediately 'a mindless troll and Fauci worshipper'. Which is strange for a community that is so focused on getting to the truth of things and real science. </p>
<p>I think it would be valuable to keep in mind the kind of bubbles and mindsets people can get sucked into very easily, regardless of which side they stand on covid issues.</p>
<p>Thoughts? People who agree or disagree with these issues?</p></p>

        <p>This sub has many problems. </p>
<p>I've seen what you described in posts by trolls that lie about our "winning" like the recent post that claims people are protesting in front of Macron's home (it's a lie, it was from 2019) along with another similar one claiming to be a protest against the vaccine passports in France but is actually a BLM protest from Boston in the US. Anyone who pointed this out was labeled a "shill", a "troll", a liar, and so on. </p>
<p>There's more issues I have with people here, including mindless "optimism" but I won't go into that right now.</p>

        <p>I agree but was downvoted to oblivion for mentioning this a few weeks ago. LOL. We can’t fix the issue using the same mindset that got us into this problem. Constant name calling and belittling doesn’t accomplish anything. Oh well, Reddit is on its way out of my life because arguing on here accomplishes nil as well.</p>

        <p>The reason the world has gotten to the point it has is because of one side being nice and getting walked over like the world is doing now the time for civility and being nice is over you have these nutjobs and psychos wanting to exterminate the world population for not taking experimental gene therapy shots. People should take those threats seriously and what these governments and the WEF is trying to push on the world by 2030. The time for being nice is over, these super special people need words tossed back at them and much much more , they are a threat to humanity , freedom and liberty, and to basic human rights. As far as I'm concerned fuck the NPCs. Time to push back</p>

        <p>Yeah, but then they'll harass you and downvote you afterward (so your comments are censored, and you'll be discredited). If I didn't know better, I'd say these guys are actual shills (but more likely they are shithead trolls who think they're hot shit).</p>

        <p>It used to be a discussion forum back around 20k - 30k users where people could point out problems and things that are flat out wrong.  Then came more people, more shills, more bots, and less understanding.</p>
<p>That's the problem with anonymous online discussion I guess.</p>

        <p>I get that but I think it's a mark of good research in general. Plus having that citation library will prove useful when engaging others on the topic outside of reddit. I absolutely agree on the idea of the reader verifying the source as well, it goes both ways.</p>

        <p>Agree. And I've had post removed because they were a follow up to a post made on NNN because it "didn't directly involve covid itself"...well, neither did the original post. Had absolutely nothing to do with covid yet got 1.5K likes and comments. Mine got deleted and people yelling it wasn't covid related...again, it was literally a repost from a top post that did not get banned or have rude comments. 🙄</p>

        <p>I noticed this the other day too.
I didn't say anything about it being false. Not everyone is on the same page or even in the same book sometimes. I just keep scrolling and hope people have enough sense to take everything on this subreddit with a grain of skepticism - that's just good life advice</p>

        <p>This is inherent to reddit. Specific communities upvote what they relate the most to, thus ending up with a strong bias in one direction. 4chan works the other way around, unpopular opinions often getting the most interactions. You simply need to acknowledge it and stay critical of everything.</p>

        <p>Like any social media platform, you will always have shit posting to sort through. Modern media these days requires cross referencing any story or bit of info with 4 or 5 sources to get a clearer picture of reality.

        <p>Yeah I agree, we ain't perfect.</p>
<p>But we're trying to get there. The people here have(for the most part) the best of intentions.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind how most people here are feeling. How they've been ostracized, called names and disrespected for about a year. Some people have a lot of bottled up anger from that, and of course they're wrong to take it out on you or others, I'm not defending that, but that's something we must take into account.</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree with the ideology of this subreddit, I guess, but I have grown unhappy with it. A lot of people here, as you said, seem to do exactly what the other side of aisle does. They get all of their information from echo chambers on the internet and not in reality. I saw someone here recently who said it was "impossible to have a conversation with a vaxxer" or something like that. I was just like.... dude have you ever been outside? I have conversations with vaccinated people all of the time about it and it's always fine. You could just tell this dude got all of his info about vaccinated people from this subreddit and not in reality. There is just tons of hypocrisy here. They make fun of liberal fact checkers but whenever someone makes a claim about vaccines being effective it's all of the sudden "source? source? source?"</p>
<p>I could go on I guess but what's the point. I don't come here near as much as I used to. I find it's better for my mental health to stop reading anything about covid. I just live my life at this point.</p>

        <p>Yeah yeah, I know you don't bother to participate... You just want to complain about how others participate.</p>
<p>I don't need you to tell me that part. I knew before ever looking at your history. This post you wrote is basically a carbon copy of 1000s of other posts of people doing the same thing.</p>

<p>Nobody cares about the one time you were mistreated (Were you even mistreated? Who knows?), or how you think the content could be improved.</p>
<p>But people might care if you were a member of the community that contributed.</p>

<p>Well, don't flatter yourself. I don't have to be angry to tell you that your complaint post holds no water, and that you should try to participate rather than tell others how to participate.</p>

<p>I never said you have to be blind to anything.</p>
<p>I did tell you that if you are an expert on what "good content" should look like, and you want to see more of it in this subreddit - then you should participate in the "good" way you want to see it done - rather than simply complain.</p>
<p>&rt;Also if you say there are thousands of other posts pointing out this issue, </p>
<p>Yeah, people like you. I guess it's an etiquette fetish of sorts? I dunno. But your OP could be from any subreddit or any internet chat room on any topic.</p>
<p>&rt;that confirms that I am seeing something legitimate here.</p>
<p>Your replies confirm for me my long held supposition that you, and people like you, will continue to make these etiquette fetish posts because that is all you are really here for. You don't really want to talk about the topic of the subreddit... you want to tell other people how to act. You are the kind of person that doesn't believe in the 1st amendment and would ban people left and right for not obeying your etiquette fetish rules.</p>
<p>And the etiquette fetish is the only real reason why you are here. Not Covid, or lockdowns or ending the new normal or even "Good Posts". It's all an internet etiquette fetish.</p>
<p>And yeah - the internet is full of people like you.</p>

        <p>You realize that 90% of the comments agree with my observation. Did you check their post his histories too? </p>
<p>I think you're the real troll. I love the first amendment, and I love people protesting masks and lockdowns. The thing is that you don't actually know anything about me, but for some reason you get some sort of kick out of belittling all of my opinions. I don't find it offensive, it's more of a fascinating mindset to me.</p>
<p>And what in the hell is an etiquette finished by the way? I generally think that promoting good information and speaking respectfully when you exercise your free speech is good practice. I guess you could call that a fetish?</p>
<p>And my final note, the reason I don't post here and I mostly read, is that I don't really want to put the energy into posting because of the original issues that I pointed out. The amount of backlash you get for posting factual information is just not worth it to me, so instead I stuck to reading and occasionally commenting.</p>

        <p>&rt; out of belittling all of my opinions.</p>
<p>Haha. We've discussed one opinion, stranger. And you are right - I couldn't disagree with your approach more.</p>
<p>How that became "belittling all of my opinions" is probably part of your etiquette fetish. I find most of the people like you demand agreement, or cry "Troll!!!!"...</p>
<p>&rt;And what in the hell is an etiquette finished by the way? </p>
<p>Buddy, I didn't misspell it one time.</p>
<p>&rt;I guess you could call that a fetish?</p>
<p>The part that makes it a fetish is the way you focus only on that - not actually here to discuss Covid or the topic of the subreddit.</p>
<p>&rt;And my final note, the reason I don't post here</p>
<p>I honestly don't care why you've convinced yourself that you can't find time to participate on the topic of the subreddit and can only find time to chastise others who don't live up to your etiquette standards.</p>
<p>Just like I don't care why some dude has a foot fetish or a boob fetish.</p>
<p>I suppose you could say I have a "Participation Fetish". Because I do. I believe that the best way to make the point you are trying to make is to participate and write the "good posts" you want to see, and be the voice you want to hear.</p>
<p>Between the two of our fetishes, I'll gladly reject yours.</p>

        <p>So in your opinion, if I begin making regular posts about how we could fight for people's constitutional rights without being scientifically illiterate, then that gives me the right to complain about commenters? </p>
<p>It must be my post specifically, it cannot be someone else's post? Like how you cannot critique books without being an author yourself? I mean, everybody knows that if you don't write books you have no right to critique the words of another author, no matter how crappy they may be.</p>

<p>I'd still probably ignore your complaining, but respect it more. Yeah.</p>
<p>&rt;It must be my post specifically, it cannot be someone else's post? </p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>&rt;Like how you cannot critique books without being an author yourself?</p>
<p>Why yes, I do think "book review" people also suck in general and mostly don't know what they are talking about and are being paid off by publishers to print good reviews. But an actual author - especially an author who I like - saying "Read This Book!" is a stellar review...</p>
<p>For example, 1985 - basically a cliff notes/review of 1984 by the author Anthony Burgess (Who wrote A Clockwork Orange)... now THAT was a great review of 1984!</p>
<p>Great analogy.</p>
<p>&rt; I mean, everybody knows that if you don't write books you have no right to critique the words of another author, no matter how crappy they may be.</p>
<p>Nice to see you finally admitting your only reason for being here is to critique others on their internet etiquette. Good luck with that fetish.</p>
