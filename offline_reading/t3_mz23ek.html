    <strong>Something happened this weekend I wanted to share:</strong>
    <p><p><em>Wrote this for another group about my weekend.</em> </p>
<p><em>I am my Fathers' Daughter. I just hope I make the same impression on my children that he made on us:</em></p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>A street preacher was out in the town we visited over the weekend. She was explaining how there needs to be prayer done before you go out and get a vaccine of something you aren't sure of. She wasn't threatening anyone, very clear, very meticulous. She said God is testing us, and we can't give in to the pressures of those around us. It was quite lovely, really.</p>
<p>My young daughter and I were walking by her, and a group of four drunk tourists behind us started to verbally abuse the woman. They swore, told her she's a liar, she needed to be arrested, and he was going to beat her up.</p>
<p>Kiddo and I walked a little ahead, I moved her to my other side to be in between us, and I turned around and asked the man, "Do you feel like a big boy?"</p>
<p>He looked at me, [I stand barely 5 feet tall] and said to mind my own business.</p>
<p>I said, 'you just made it my business. Do you feel like a big boy swearing and threatening a stranger in public? You swore in front of my child. Who do you think you are?"</p>
<p>He goes, 'I'm sure your kid has heard it before."</p>
<p>I yelled, "HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? You're disgusting. Your behavior, your language, it's disgusting, and how dare you assume anything. That woman has a first amendment right to speak freely. Who do YOU think you are?"</p>
<p>His girlfriend grabbed him by the shirt before he even turned around and hauled ass across the street. Kiddo was mortified, but when the adrenaline wore off, I explained that woman had every right to say whatever she wants without threats. We protect each others Constitutional freedoms and what was disappointing to me is no one else stood up. I had to. We had a teaching moment that it's ok to be a pretty, smart, independent Anti-Bully. If you see it in school, say something. Loudly. I will always support you. Always treat others with kindness and NEVER be afraid to call an asshole an asshole.</p>
<p>SHOW your children how to take on demons. They'll fight for what's right long after we're gone.</p></p>
