    <strong>Resenting the president elect even though he’s not the really the shot caller</strong>
    <p><p>As y’all know the dems have started back tracking on lockdowns this week. I should be happy right? I’m not. For some reason, I’m angry. I know why I’m angry but it’s not fair. </p>
<p>I’m angry at Joe Biden for allowing people to wreck the economy and lives so he could get elected. But I know logically he didn’t point his finger and give the command. I’m trying hard to stop blaming him but he’s the most visible person who I can lay blame on. It sucks and I don’t like this feeling.</p></p>

        <p>In many respects, Biden was a Trojan Horse candidate. If he gets sworn in next week, he will be by far the oldest person to take the oath of office. He didn’t really do a lot of campaigning, and appears to have run initially to provide cover for his family’s shady dealings in Ukraine and elsewhere (remember the first impeachment and how they claimed President Trump was doing it to harm a political opponent?). </p>
<p>In the early stages of the pandemic, I think the Democrats saw an opportunity to make people miserable and blame it on President Trump. Additionally, they saw mail in balloting as an opportunity to stuff the ballot boxes (the rejection rate for mail in ballots was a lot lower in 2020, in some states by a factor of 100). </p>
<p>Sadly, we still don’t know who is the man or woman behind the curtain calling the shots. Personally, I suspect it’s Obama. If the constitution allowed it, the Dems would have run him again in 2016 and 2020. But then again, you have a lot of Democrats who are getting old like Pelosi and are not yet ready to pass the torch to the younger generation.</p>

        <p>I agree with most of what you're saying, but you give Obama too much credit. The real shot callers rarely have their names in the news. The fact that we frequently hear about Soros and Gates so often suggests to me that they are lower tier oligarchs.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but Monopoly (the game) usually ends when one person owns it all. When that happens, people leave the table. But when that happens in real life, and you can't leave the table, you get stimulus checks and UBI.</p>

        <p>I at least think Obama might be the kingpin in the Democratic Party. You don’t really hear much about him in the news since he left office. But unlike other former presidents, he decided to stay in DC after leaving office, giving him easy access to the Dem political elites. </p>
<p>That said, I do think there are a set of oligarchs trying to exploit the pandemic to gain even more money and power through the “great reset.” I’m convinced the winners of the “great reset” have already been determined, and we the common folk aren’t among them.</p>

        <p>all politicians are just puppets they do not come up with any of this themselves they are just mouthpieces and front men for the people who do come up with this stuff.
that's why basically all the politicians in most countries are doing the exact same shit play by play because they are all controlled by the same people.</p>

        <p>I don't care for Trump's attitude but there are some things he has done and stood up for that I agree with.</p>
<p>On principle I was hoping Biden did not win - his entire campaign was basically "I'm not THAT guy!" and "look at me! I wear a mask ALL the time!" Not much else.</p>
<p>My hope is things start to change in relation to Covid with him in office, because honestly I don't think things were with Trump. At least the negativity and blaming it all on him was not going to change.</p>
<p>I don't think Biden will accomplish a lot. I think it will be a lot like the Obama administration where they just won people over by giving them free stuff. Free phones, health care, etc. They're already doing it now.</p>
<p>Not that it's all entirely a bad thing. I'd like to see more income equality and paying people a wage they can actually afford to live alone one to start with would be a good thing. It's hard out there, harder when you have kids. But all this just wasting taxpayers money so you can sit on your butt at home all day because you don't feel like working - nah.</p>
