    <strong>Care to review my potential social media post? Proofreaders/editors in this crowd? I've been silent for awhile now....(struggling with how much longer to hold out).....</strong>
    <p><p><em>Please edit/rip apart/provide mindful suggestions. I'd like to sound as solid and compassionate as possible. However, I feel like I've done that in the past and gotten POUNCED ON.</em> <strong><em>I want to make sure there isn't much to attack, shame or ridicule here.</em></strong> <em>Find all the holes. Thank you!</em></p>
<p>**DRAFT**</p>
<p>Pilots, healthcare workers, and the US military….all careers dedicated to YOUR safety! A lot of them walking off the jobs today and more going forward.  They have sacrificed a LOT to keep you safe…time away from their families, missing holidays, losing sleep, long hours, etc etc. And. Let me remind you. For the last 15+ months, they’ve been WORKING THE ENTIRE TIME IN PERSON.  You can't fly a plane, put an IV in a patient or do [military stuff? - help here] at home!</p>
<p>I think some of the professionals working in these specific careers (not all) are asking you that certain things require YOU to take personal responsibility for. One of those things is your health. They PROMISE to keep you as safe as possible in the skies, while ill and needing care, and while at home (while they may be overseas). Can you do them a solid and stand down on these medical requirement demands for YOUR safety? They are good people. You wouldn’t trust them with your lives if they weren’t! I don't know all of their reasons for refusal, but I've trusted these professionals in the past and I will continue to put my trust in them in the future.</p>
<p>If individuals (and corporations) continue to demand and cheer for forcing something on another person against their will, I'm not sure how this is going to end. Be kind everyone!</p></p>

        <p>It won't matter.  If you don't conform they will call you a murderer and conspiracy theorist.  Remember the axiom about religious converts--they are always the most zealous is trying to convert others, in order to reinforce their decision and worldview.  </p>
<p>COVID/Safetyism is a religion.  You are a heretic.  If they could get away with it, they would burn you at the stake.</p>

<p>no matter what you write, however well-written or well-researched, you WILL be attacked, ridiculed, and shamed, most likely with dumb false equivalencies. If it's not, you're playing it too safe. It's time to get comfortable being uncomfortable.</p>

<li>
<p>don't write about what you don't know. If you can't come up with 'military stuff' don't write about it. Be authentic.</p>

        <p>I wonder if you need to focus on one of these professions to make a more concise point. There is a concept used in marketing and fund raisingcalled the "identifiable victim" effect. People will donate more if you focus on Juan, a 5 year old separated from his mom at the border, than if you say 200,000 children have been separated at the border. People need to emotionally connect and I think it will be easier to do if you choose one of these. If you chose pilots you can say at the end that health care and military are experiencing the same. </p>
<p>Remove "I think..." If you aren't positive, don't post it.</p>
<p>Soften the tone of the second paragraph. You want to make them care about the pilot, not feel like they are a crappy person. If they feel like a crappy person, their mind will immediately start coming up with reasons why they aren't a crappy person and they will get defensive.</p>

        <p>If you go with the soldier example, you can talk about how they “do it for the greater good” by putting their lives on the line overseas. Imagine just coming back from Afghanistan and being fired for not getting the COVID vaccine.</p>

        <p>Maybe for military stuff, use defend your country. </p>
<p>The second paragraph reads a little awkward in the first three sentences. Try to re-word that a little smoother. </p>
<p>I like what you are saying, but I can tell you exactly the rebuttal you'll get. Are you prepared to read that you are wrong, that these people are being selfish and irresponsible, that the commentor won't want people like that serving them if they choose to remain unvaxxed, that they are part of the problem, and all of that not as nicely as I've written? Just keep that in mind and prepare yourself for the worst response. Every post you make is an invitation for people to show you their assholes. </p>
<p>Good luck. I sincerely hope it reaches even just one person.</p>
