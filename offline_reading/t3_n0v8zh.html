    <strong>Don't Feed The Trolls (Trust, But Verify)</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everybody!</p>
<p>I love the sub, I'm an active member because I think this is a very important sub and one of the few public forums to discuss and counter the Covid Cult. </p>
<p>And I get the kids want to keep this place open and without harsh conflict so they let all opinions be discussed and aired here. But please let's not feed the trolls.</p>
<p>I don't mean people with long established accounts that come here to debate and argue. I mean literal flimsy troll accounts: either created only days or hours ago, or else alt accounts people created solely to troll (easily recognizable because they have 200 or less active days on Reddit and have only posted on this sub, usually with very generic automated usernames).</p>
<p>These trolls are here to disrupt threads, refocus attention and energy from sub posters and topics, and ultimately frustrate any productive conversation.</p>
<p>If you suspect one, just take a look at their post history. If their account is only days or hours old, or it has some time but this is literally the only sub they've ever posted on, they are trolls. Downvote and move on. Don't feed into their disruptor strategy, it's a waste of time--which is what they are here to do.</p>
<p>Not telling you what to do but just a heads-up. Over been calling them out in threads. Sincere disagreement is encouraged but these accounts are here in bad faith and trying to derail honest discussion.</p>
<p>Also: I'm never getting the experimental vax and I'm never wearing the mask. Thanks for reading!</p></p>

        <p>I see your point, but if you look at my post history, you'll see it's mostly here.</p>
<p>This used to be my alt account, and now I basically only use this one because I like it here.</p>
<p>The rest of Reddit is so incredibly toxic.</p>

        <p>I think there's a difference on this sub between bad faith and good faith. But also, come on man, it's just reddit. Why are you hiding behind an alt? Have conviction.</p>

        <p>Because other subs completely unrelated to this one are banning users just because they comment here. </p>
<p>An alt for this sub can be smart.</p>

        <p>Counterpoint: The trolls are making swiss cheese and derailing almost every post and thread.</p>
<p>Also: why would you want to be a part of any sub that would ban you for posting here?</p>
<p>I thought this was where the courageous individuals on Reddit dare to tread. Guess you're all just the same as the rest.</p>
<p>It's a website. What we discuss here is about life and freedom. But you don't want to miss out on the same subs that hate you for your beliefs. Guess your beliefs only go so far until you lose access to things you want.</p>
<p>Gee, sounds familiar...</p>

        <p>Because like it or not there can be reasons to want to use my local sub.. which as I said is incredibly toxic... Once you associate with people here, people tend to judge you. So this account is fucking poison just because I post here alot.</p>
<p>Let's say I want to wake someone up on the local sub slowly... They might be ready to hear about why they SHOULD be skeptical of the Astra Zenica Vax... But they've been conditioned to dismiss me just because I post here alot.</p>
<p>Suddenly my opinion doesn't matter.</p>
<p>It's not us doing this mind you, it's them...</p>
