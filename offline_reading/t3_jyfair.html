    <strong>Had an encouraging interaction at the grocery store today....</strong>
    <p><p>A woman stopped my wife in the canned goods aisle and said </p>
<p>"I wanted to tell you how encouraged I am to see your family not wearing masks. When I saw you walk in I almost froze and watched wondering if someone would pounce on you and tell you to put a mask on or leave... but nothing happened and now I see you over here shopping like normal with no masks. I hate this thing so much but I wear it because I don't want a confrontation."</p>
<p>My wife said "Take it off, girl. Nobody has ever confronted us. The only store around who checks us at the door has been Target which we just kind of avoid these days."</p>
<p>A little later we passed her in the store and she said "I have to admit, it feels pretty liberating!"</p>
<p>Just thought I'd share this encouraging interaction.  Nobody has said boo to us in months and the first person who does is someone who agrees and, it seems the spell was that easy to break. Just take it off.</p></p>

        <p>That's funny. I had a similar encounter in <em>Target</em>. I just walked in no one stopped me. No one said anything at all except one older lady in the candy aisle right before Halloween.</p>
<p>Her: "Oh! You're not wearing your mask." </p>
<p>Me, not wanting to argue: "I must've forgot it."</p>
<p>Her: "Oh don't worry I don't care I'm just surprised you got by security!"</p>
<p>I live in an extremely blue town in California and I've never seen anyone else in a store without a mask on.</p>

        <p>I believe only a small small population would actually preach at someone not masking up. Some will quietly feel nervous and go home to tell the harrowing tale, some will think you’re as assholw or stupid. But people will think that about others anyway, noting new.</p>

        <p>I envy you.</p>
<p>In my area, the mask worshippers seem to be doubling down on stupid. I am actually starting to see people wearing <em>two</em> masks. Tons of people wear them outside, when alone.</p>
<p>As I go my maskless way, I can feel more and more hostility each time I go shopping or am out and about.</p>
<p>I know it's only a matter of time before I run into a serious confrontation with someone - but I'm beyond caring at this point.</p>
<p>I refuse to knuckle under to these faceless cowards.</p>

<p>Just be careful!  Stick up for your principles but always seek to de-escalate and educate rather than to confront.</p>

        <p>Local ski resort.  Comparatively their overall requirements are reasonable, especially given the area and clientele.  It might not seem like it from this part, but you can ski maskless.  But then there is the double mask part, who knows how they came up with that bit.</p>
<p>&rt;All guests will need to wear a face covering with two or more layers indoors and outdoors where distancing can’t be achieved. That means lodges, shops, shuttle busses, and all lifts. Face coverings are not required while eating or drinking, but we ask that you please leave masks on while waiting for your food and put them back on when you’re done eating. If you need a mask, many of our local shops sell them.</p>

        <p>Yep, I have a friend scared silly over this. She wears two masks, cloth on top of disposable. Lots of people wear them outside here too. I had a doctor appt the other day, and a nurse told me my mask was slipping down. That's how I wear them on purpose, if I HAVE to wear them. That's the first time anyone has said anything, although my double-mask friend reached out to touch and adjust my mask once.</p>

        <p>I see it a lot, too. Was getting an oil change in a mask state yesterday. I didn't put one on. All of the techs had them under their chins. The woman who was processing my payment was the only one actually wearing hers. I told her that if she was just wearing it for me, she should take it off. She immediately laughed and pulled it down.</p>

        <p>I went to the store this morning and about 70% of the people shopping were no wearing masks. It took me a moment to realize why things seemed “strange” and then it clicked that people were actually smiling and making eye contact with me. So silly that something so normal isn’t normal.</p>

        <p>Because if they worked, then they would have worked by now. There would be correlation between mask mandates and covid spread reduction.  </p>
<p>Instead we have multiple places in Europe where despite months of mask wearing they are just now getting record spikes in spread.  </p>
<p>Also, don't tell people they are responsible for the health of others. We're not. Americans are disproportionately impacted by Covid because we're a nation of fatties. I didn't stuff butter and sugar into my countrymen's mouths for 60 years so I'm not responsible when a rhinovirus hits them in their 80s and they're in no condition to fend it off.</p>
