    <strong>The definition of "brigading" and the future of Reddit.</strong>
    <p><p>As many of you are probably aware at this point, there has been a growing trend of other subreddits' who have implemented both automatic and manual policies and processes to ban users of r/nonewnormal from their subs for simply participating here.</p>
<p>One of the common explanations in the ban is "being a disease vector to other subreddits and society"  which indicates where they are coming from and you can draw parallels to how something similar is happening in real life where people are being shunned and exiled from society in a supposed attempt to enforce compliance to the medical "guidance" but I'll leave it at that since that topic warrants its own discussion.</p>
<p>The example I will use is based off of the complaint from r coronavirus which is probably where I find out about this sub myself many months ago and from my perspective was the primary coronavirus/covid forum since it was one of the first and even seemed to have some official tie-ins with Reddit as a place to get covid information from.  It seems extremely likely that anyone who is on r/nonewnormal is interested in coronavirus/covid as a topic so is it really a brigade if users wanted to participate in both subreddits?  Our sub is pretty explicit in our skeptical nature towards covid and it's natural for people to want to engage in discussion on a topic with a more neutrally oriented perspective such as r coronavirus.</p>
<p>So, when something is crossposted onto our sub, it seems like a natural impulse for people to want to debate something with people who have a different perspective.  Not allowing users from our sub is basically not allowing any dissent from whatever the moderators their determine is acceptable thought.  After seeing the self-censorship imposed by places like Facebook and Google/Youtube related to trying to control the narrative over the origins of Covid, it seems clear that having a controlled narrative seems to be the direction that most of the internet is going.  For many at the moment, they applaud the way that this power over information is being used by Big Tech because they are using it for what they think is for the greater good (stopping "dangerous ideas" etc.).  The problem is that these companies are just businesses trying to make money for themselves and shareholders so while many people agree with it now, it seems short-sighted to assume that we can rely on them to not "be evil" in the future.</p>
<p>Circling back to the main point, my understanding of brigading is that it is defined by a coordinated attempt to have users interfere with the sub that they are targeting and people should raise any of this behavior to us via modmail.  But from what I have seen so far this hasn't been the case for the most part and the bans by association further illustrate this point that these bans are actually just an attempt at censoring dissenting viewpoints.</p>
<p>All of this is under the backdrop of a growing divide in society where many of us live in places where we basically only interact with people of the same political identification so our online interactions are the only exposure we have to the "other side".  Furthering that division to online platforms seems like it will only deepen mistrust and animosity between people and bring us closer to something much more destructive that we have already been seeing the signs of in recent years.</p></p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that man.</p>
<p>Superstonk have worked really hard to keep the shilling out and so when Reddit made the changes they took a very extreme stance and banned any and all crossposting or even mentions of other subs in posts or comments.</p>
<p>I'd usually be against that sort of thing on principal but given the circumstances surrounding GME, it's understandable.</p>
<p>Also, I may have read it wrong, but I felt that the brigading stuff was actually AIMED at SuperStonk so the mods had to do something to show they wouldn't allow brigading, even though I don't really feel like that's what was happening.</p>

        <p>They really should implement some functionality to let a user have control over their own post and where it ends up.</p>
<p>I wonder if the reason they don't is laziness or some strategic reason but if it was an option I would select disable crossposts or better yet, be able to specify a list of subs.</p>
<p>Or better yet, there should be system where the person who posted it get's notification of a request to crosspost and they have to approve it.</p>

        <p>Very well said. I agree wholeheartedly.  My circle both in real life and online is shrinking daily.  I assume that’s happening on the other side as well.  Scary times for us if we don’t all wake up and realize ANY censorship (whether you agree with the words or not) is bad.  Being against “misinformation” is being sold as virtuous, but really it’s just being pro-censorship and anti-free speech.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but people start convulsing when you make any comparisons to that kind of history even though the word itself is not explicitly tied to race.  I do think it's more fitting than "digital divide" because that already had a different meaning since almost a decade ago.</p>

<p>Yeah, I found out about the site \~ 2008 when it was like that and I worried the Digg and college student immigration to the sub would ruin it but it wasn't really until around 2018 when I started to notice things going downhill and taken over by teens generally.</p>

        <p>I have learned many things from people who don't agree with me (but can back their disagreement with a good explanation) and I learn different views, and also it is good to see if one's argument holds up, or if it needs clarifying, etc.</p>
<p>Civil and respectful debate is good, and censoring and silencing of people that disagree and doing it en masse  would seem to go against Reddit's own rules to facilitate discussion. After all, that is what Reddit was supposed to be about.</p>
<p>I don't expect people to agree with me on everything, and I with them, but it goes a long way to UNDERSTAND their position and why they hold the opinion they do - which you can not get if you don't talk things out.</p>

        <p>This is so true. A few banal but slightly out of resonance comments gets you downvoted to oblivion in certain subs, but I have had many sensible conversations with people willing to engage and listen.

        <p>Mods on larger subs are using a bot like saferbot or whatever to censor undesired narrative from subs like this, which should be criminal. Also from what I've seen there has been no REAL brigading, TRUST me brigading can be a very complex assault on a designated sub. This is just lazy mods wanting their precious mod queues clean and no drama. You'd be surprised, mods on those huge subs are worse than a crying baby.</p>

        <p>The problem for me is that without any specific details about brigading coming from these other mods, I have no awareness or control over what's happening on other subs.</p>
<p>The one official brigading complaint I was made aware of had super flimsy / non-existent evidence over the brigade other than one post that was somebody saying that we should go over to an AMA they were having on r coronavirus.</p>
<p>But based on what you mentioned, it seems consistent with what I've observed.  Those subs probably don't have many reports typically so probably think something sinister was happening.  They should tell their users to stop filing reports on comments they simply disagree with.  </p>
<p>I envy modding a sub where there is ever a clean queue and no drama though, haha.</p>

        <p>And you won't receive any specific details and the evidence will always be non existent. Modding any popular sub, you will never have a clean queue for more than maybe 24 hours. Also you have to think about this I'm not banned from r/aww or r/dankmemes because those mods are bad motherfuckers. The subs banning users from this sub particularly seem to be boomer/ karen type subs where the mods don't know python and can't write their own bot. Thus they use safebot or what have you to blanket ban.</p>

<p>Are you under the impression that's a new thing?  I had an account banned from /r/news in March of 2017 merely because I posted on r/the_donald once.  And you can tell the mod is clearly an adult by the way they refer it to as the_dildo.</p>

        <p>I did not ask for the oligarchy and their servants to declare war on us all.</p>
<p>However, I understand what this situation is and what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Being in the trenches with all of you is better than slavery and meaningless existence!</p>
<p>The enemies of humanity can lie and murder and steal but they can never be where we stand today: On the right side of history. We are not poisoning the wells; we are trying to keep the people around us from drinking the poison. We counter deception with logic and evidence.</p>
<p>What greater triumph over evil is there than this? We have already won through finding truth and reason. Even 1000 years of Schwab's dystopia could never change that.</p>

        <p>There may not be as much difference as the OP thinks. Even if the mods don't ban them for brigading their posts are going to get downvoted into oblivion. I have a post on /r/coronavirus that has 500 downvotes(!).  And I wasn't even hostile or anything--just made what I thought was a bland observation--however, I dared to question the sainthood of Dr. Fauci and that was enough to make them go wild.  </p>
<p>So ban or no ban the conversation is not going to happen; not unless both sides want it to happen.</p>

        <p>Okay, this way in-depth and this is exactly what I want to say but puts it more eloquently than I would. The seeds are definitely being sewn for more destructive behavior and events to happen, and there is a huge divide in this country. Everybody has an opinion and most can't speak it freely, but one side can, and unless you comply with that way of thinking you are silenced. So then there is a bubble that grows bigger and bigger... until everything bursts. People have been talking about a civil war for years and most don't even realize we are already in the midst of it.</p>

<p>Thank you for saying this. Right wingers have trouble understanding this basic fact about "cancel culture". They falsely characterize it as a "free speech" issue, despite the fact that you have no right to speak in someone else's property.</p>
<p>&rt;However, that doesn't stop me from thinking it's wrong and only accelerates the fracturing of society.</p>
<p>I don't disagree with you at all. Cancel culture does fracture of the society, indeed. But that's a criticism of the concept called "liberty", not of cancel culture. If you believe that we have the right to ban people from our property, then you'll see the society getting fractured. I still believe ends don't justify means.</p>
<p>&rt;Yes, we have to ban many people because the vast majority are not interested in discussion and debate. </p>
<p>It's not just about discussion and debate. Even if the doomers genuinely come here to converse and debate, they are still not entitled to speak on this sub. We have to make sure that we remain the majority in this sub. If the posts promoting lockdowns and mask mandates start getting upvotes, then the entire premise of this sub becomes null and void (as we saw what happened to "free speech" /r/libertarian).</p>

        <p>Jumping in here with a copy from another post similar to see what you think about: </p>
<p>Most of these large platforms have become monopolies within themselves, and entrenched into our daily lives for some over a decade.  Now that censorship is full on, it isn’t as easy as just leaving. They say “well just create your own platform” and when others do: they’re banned from app stores and unable to find hosting ie AWS. It’s extremely challenging, if not almost impossible to do so, purposely. So these very platform have become way out of hand and scope, and one day will bite every hand that is cheerleading for it today.  </p>
<p>It’s lunacy to not allow any place for nearly 50%+ of the population to go freely without major obstacles, or the entire MSM narrative calling it “racist” to intimidate anyone in the middle to not join these other options out of fear of being labeled.  Look how Parler was treated as an example. It was insane to see the entire machine go against something in full force in real-time together- Google, Apple, AWS, and MSM all joined together to demonize/cancel it outright. Most normal people wouldn’t dare make the switch over there out of fear of being labeled “racist, right-winger”- even if that was furthest from the truth. </p>
<p>Have your site, do your thing under your right to have one- but as soon as it becomes nearly impossible to compete in any meaningful way (as it is today), something has to give eventually to allow a more diverse platform opportunity. </p>

        <p>So I disagree with you and here is why. If I post here, there is no reason another subreddit should care. As long as I am not going to their subreddit (that may or may not be a similar topic) and break their rules, then that other subreddit shouldn't care what I do here.</p>
<p>This goes beyond "posting in someone else's house". You would have a point of people were going to these other subreddits and bringing up topics from here to post there. But that isn't the case. They are figuratively eavesdropping on conversations in this sub and banning you before you could even post in their subreddit.</p>
<p>Also, a clarification point about freedom of speech. The constitution protects your right of freedom of speech against the government, true. However, the right exist regardless if the government approves of it. All of the bill of rights were written that the rights exists regardless if the government wants to recognize them. </p>
<p>The concept of freedom of speech shouldn't be tossed aside because the government isn't involved. We should still cherish it on other avenues.</p>
