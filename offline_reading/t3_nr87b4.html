    <p><p>It's not gonna stop because of that.</p>
<p>Remember, the average fella is that much of a goldfish that once Fauci is ejected they'll completely forget and cease all doubt on government procedures and liberty restrictions.</p>
<p>Where are the actual big ones? When do I get to see Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab receive the death penalty?</p></p>

        <p>The Fauci emails are a giant nothingburger you r*tards actually think Cov19 is some global conspiracy orchestrated from the worlds elite class, and they’re gonna let all that fall apart from a FOIA request 😂😂😂😂</p>
<p>You know how easily they could ignore a FOIA request right? The only reason Podestas emails were even mildly interesting was because they were stolen.</p>

        <p>OK first question, will you please realise this was never about a virus... the virus is just a tool being used?</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum held a pandemic training exercise 6 months before Covid-19 pandemic... do you honestly think that was a coincidence?</p>
<p>What about the fact that all of us saying the virus originated from a lab I  Wuhan were called "Conspiracy Theorists" but now it is being suggested as the truth even in the mainstream? Do you think that is a coincidence?</p>
<p>What about the fact that we are now in the 4th Industrial Revolution, utilising AI to automate things, that is what 5G is all for? Is that another coincidence?</p>
<p>What about the fact that this 4th Industrial revolution combined with the destruction of businesses thanks to the covid response, will lead to mass unemployment across the west...is that a coincidence too?</p>
<p>What about the fact that they are already trialling universal basic income in several countries, notably Ireland and Wales... is that a coincidence?</p>
<p>What about the fact that in the UK the vaccine passport digital app has been discovered to be implementing other forms of surveillance, including, a persons: mental health, social circle, crimes, alleged criminal behaviour, ethnicity, etc etc
Is this again a coincidence?</p>
<p>Are you starting to see yet?
Their plan is to have west in a social credit system like China...</p>
<p>Everyone on universal basic income, they set whatever parameters they want and monitor your every move, if you aren't an obedient slave, you don't get your money to buy food...</p>
<p>Covid was just a tool, this is why we oppose their Covid response at every step, and this is why so much of their response and figures are based on lies and fear mongering.</p>
<p>These emails I doubt will achieve anything, just something to placate the people waking up and realising what is happening.</p>

        <p>First of all, nice use of r*tards</p>
<p>Second, not sure where you got the idea this reveals a global conspiracy. It certainly shows Fauci just lied to Congress, potentially showed negligence at the least, for ignoring HCQ, more receipts on his knowledge of gain of function, and early talks on how to spin the wet market narrative.</p>
<p>Which, could be pieces of a puzzle. One would have to ask what would China have to gain? What would Fauci gain? To understand these pieces.</p>

        <p>Yea man. Must just be a coincidence Facebook founder is found in Fauci’s emails asking how to spin the pandemic. Must just have been a coincidence we took the path that made the rich/richer throughout the pandemic. </p>

<p>Ya know....all the companies out there pushing for more lockdowns....</p>
<p>Sorry that you don’t have the mental capacities, or are just ignorant due to lack of information, but it shows Fauci just lied to Congress. Particularly Rand Paul. </p>
<p>It also shows he may have negligently ignored HCQ. A life saving drug. Not anything that Fauci isn’t used to though:</p>

<p>“Dr. Anthony Fauci is rewriting history. He is doing so to disguise his shameful role in delaying promotion of an AIDS treatment that would have prevented tens of thousands of deaths in the first years of the epidemic.”</p>
<p>I may be r*traded but not enough to believe big pharma has my best interest:</p>
