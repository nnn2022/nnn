        <p>Scientific method well... used to work like this - present hypothesis, conduct an experiment to prove it. Only after many trials of identical circumstances can you conclude with decent certainty for or against your hypothesis.</p>

<p>Well, it used to be present a hypothesis and then <em>test</em> that hypothesis, as opposed to PROVING your hypothesis, which seems to be more in line with The Science these days.</p>

        <p>So off topic (a little) but why the vehement stance against masks?</p>
<p>Like  this is a legit question. I honestly believed in the beginning that masks would be useful. Hell  I still think they might be (even if I hate wearing). I just want to hear why people are so against them.</p>

        <p>California Department of Health: 
“Face coverings may increase risk if users reduce their use of strong defenses."  </p>
<p>"There is limited evidence to suggest that use of cloth face coverings by the public during a pandemic could help reduce disease transmission.”</p>
<p>https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Face-Coverings-Guidance.aspx?TSPD_101_R0=087ed344cfab2000f8235394d3c04725af3906ffb74bfdc00cfde0dd800d51fc26ca3ef9b7ee1f9d0889ca5aa3143000460c06f37cc478a01b662d45e002d45eaa19cbc20dd89458473f75d4a23666b78545d863caf282de13a218f39d2cb713</p>
<p>FDA: “Even a properly fitted N95 mask does not prevent illness or death.”</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20200516235249/https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks</p>
<p>“Oral masks in healthy individuals are ineffective against the spread of viral infections,” write Belgian medical doctors in an open letter published in The American Institute of Stress, September 24, 2020.</p>
<p>https://www.stress.org/open-letter-from-medical-doctors-and-health-professionals-to-all-belgian-authorities-and-all-belgian-media</p>
<p>“It has never been shown that wearing surgical face masks decreases postoperative wound infections,” writes Göran Tunevall, M.D. in the World Journal of Surgery. “On the contrary, a 50% decrease [in bacterial infection] has been reported after omitting face masks.”</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1853618/</p>
<p>“There were 17 eligible studies.… None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask ⁄ respirator use and protection against influenza infection,” concludes a research review in the journal Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses.</p>
<p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</p>
<p>Dutch Minister for Medical Care, Tamara van Ark, asserted that “from a medical perspective there is no proven effectiveness of masks” after a review by the National Institute for Health on July 29, 2020 (according to Reuters).</p>
<p>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-netherlands-idUSKCN24U2UJ</p>
<p>“In fact, there is no study to even suggest that it makes any sense for healthy individuals to wear masks in public,” write Drs. Karina Reiss, Phd and Dr. Sucharit Bakdi, MD in Corona, False Alarm? “One might suspect that the only political reason for enforcing the measure is to foster fear in the population.”</p>
<p>https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/corona-false-alarm</p>
<p>A CDC-funded review on masking in May 2020 came to the conclusion: “Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza… None of the household studies reported a significant reduction in secondary laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the face mask group.” If masks can’t stop the regular flu, how can they stop SAR-CoV-2?</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>“I believe the real threat right now is what we’re doing to sabotage the mental, emotional and physical health of… our children, whose development is dependent on social interactions, physical contact and facial expressions,” writes Dr. Joseph Mercola of Mercola.com. “Between mask wearing and social distancing, I fear the impact on children in particular may be long-term, if not permanent.”</p>
<p>https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/11/12/how-would-you-prefer-to-spend-your-last-thanksgiving.aspx</p>
<p>Many (if not most) masks and face coverings (including cloth) are made with toxic and carcinogenic chemicals including fire retardant, fibreglass, lead, NFE, phthalates, polyfluorinated chemicals and formaldehyde that will outgas and be inhaled by the wearer. (See “5 main hazardous chemicals in clothing from China named” by Fashion United).</p>
<p>https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/5-main-hazardous-chemicals-in-clothing-from-china-named/2018102939678</p>
<p>Masks create an irrational fear of germs and a false sense of protection from disease, leading to antisocial (or even hostile) behaviour towards those not wearing a mask. (See the paper in the Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders titled “COVID-19, obsessive-compulsive disorder and invisible life forms that threaten the self”).</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324330/</p>
<p>“Mask use by the general public could be associated with a theoretical elevated risk of COVID-19 through… self-contamination,” states Public Health Ontario in Wearing Masks in Public and COVID-19.</p>
<p>https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/covid-wwksf/what-we-know-public-masks-apr-7-2020.pdf?la=en</p>
<p>At an Oklahoma Press Conference, Dr. James Meehan, MD testified: “Reports coming from my colleagues all over the world are suggesting that the bacterial pneumonias are on the rise” as a result of moisture collecting in face masks.</p>
<p>https://fb.watch/4BgK5UH2DC/</p>
<p>“Masks are utterly useless,” testified Dr. Roger Hodkinson, a pathologist, certified with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, at a city council meeting. “…masks are simply virtue-signalling… It’s utterly ridiculous seeing these unfortunate, uneducated people — I’m not saying that in a pejorative sense — walking around like lemmings, obeying without any knowledge base, to put the mask on their face.”</p>
<p>https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/health-expert-outraged-government-response-covid/</p>
<p>Masks and respirators do not work. There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles.</p>
<p>https://www.sott.net/article/434796-The-Science-is-Conclusive-Masks-and-Respirators-do-NOT-Prevent-Transmission-of-Viruses</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic is about viral transmission. Surgical and cloth masks do nothing to prevent viral transmission. We should all realize by now that face masks have never been shown to prevent or protect against viral transmission. Which is exactly why they have never been recommended for use during the seasonal flu outbreak, epidemics, or previous pandemics.”</p>
<p>https://cnsnews.com/index.php/commentary/dr-jim-meehan/surgeon-destroys-myth-if-masks-dont-work-why-do-surgeons-wear-them</p>
<p>The increasing polarised and politicised views on whether to wear masks in public during the current COVID-19 crisis hides a bitter truth on the state of contemporary research and the value we pose on clinical evidence to guide our decisions.</p>

<p>A February 2021 review by the European CDC found no significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of non-medical and medical face masks in the community. Furthermore, the European CDC advised against the use of FFP2/N95 respirators by the general public. </p>
<p>https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-face-masks-community-first-update.pdf</p>
<p>A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting.</p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</p>
<p>A November 2020 Cochrane review found that face masks did not reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. </p>

<p>In the US state of Kansas, the 90 counties without mask mandates had lower coronavirus infection rates than the 15 counties with mask mandates. To hide this fact, the Kansas health department tried to manipulate the official statistics and data presentation.</p>

<p>During the notorious 1918 influenza pandemic, the use of cloth face masks among the general population was widespread and in some places mandatory, but they made no difference.</p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/</p>
<p>In China, several children who had to wear a mask during sports classes fainted and died; the autopsies found a sudden cardiac arrest as the probable cause of death.</p>
<p>https://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/31100/student-deaths-lead-schools-to-adjust-rules-on-masks-while-exercising</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Minnesota found that the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 is just 300 virions (virus particles), whereas a single minute of normal speaking may generate more than 750,000 virions, making cloth face masks unlikely to prevent an infection.</p>

<p>I believe this is enough evidence to prove my claim is true.</p>

        <p>They were right.  People were scared and wanted to do something.  The government decided, let's do this.  It was a lucky rabbit's foot, people want it to work, and have therefore convinced themself it does.  Triumph of the Will.</p>
<hr>
<p>CDC:</p>
<p>"<strong>We did not find evidence</strong> that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility."</p>
