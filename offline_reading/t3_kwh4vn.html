    <strong>My two cents as someone who randomly found this sub</strong>
    <p><p><strong>For the lazy people like me, the most important stuff is bold.</strong></p>
<p>I hope this whole post doesn't seem arrogant, I just like discussions and arguments, and wanted to give you my point of view. Maybe you don't care, that's fine. If you have anything to add, then please do so, I love discussing new topics. Just stay civil, I'd appreciate that.</p>
<p>In a lot comments I see people complaining that the "other side" is biased, sometimes even corrupt etc. But this subs name is literally "No New Normal", so hard-coded against lockdowns. And it makes sense that you're getting tired about people trying to discuss/argue. It just seems very ironic to me - <strong>You're complaining about</strong> <strong>not being heard</strong> and understood <strong>by the</strong> general <strong>public</strong><em>,</em> <strong>yet you do the same</strong> to them.</p>
<p>And that's what I don't understand - If you claim to be skeptic, critically thinking and the like. Then why are you as biased as the so called "other side"? In my mind, that doesn't make you any better than the perceived "other side". <strong>Instead of comparing multiple options</strong>, discussing them <strong>and allowing every opinion, everyone is just as biased as the people you're complaining about.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I miss a pinned post with sources.</strong> All I saw were memes and selected news articles which are either about negative aspects of lockdowns or positive aspects of not having lockdowns. <strong>You complain</strong> <strong>about mainstream news lying,</strong> <strong>yet all you do is look at news which positively reinforce your current opinion</strong>. </p>
<p>Show me your actual evidence :) I wanna read about all the options and thoughts. But <strong>actual evidence</strong>, who cares about tweets, memes, and facebook posts by random people. <strong>Show me peer-reviewed studies, comparisons and other kinds of resources.</strong></p>
<p>Take care, stay healthy.</p></p>

        <p>Yes you are clearly lazy if all you see is memes. </p>
<p>The sub can be searched and perused as you see fit and all the questions you have posed will be answered, still pretty lazy. </p>
<p>It's ironic that you weren't lazy enough to type out all this drivel though, that's alot of words to say, "Spoon feed me all the readily available information I already have at my fingertips, and let me seem like I have a genuine interest in learning anything".</p>
<p>Hey everyone! The sub has been up for months and is full of the information this very genuine person wants to learn, but go ahead and type it all out for him again because he's shown this stunning bravery by posting and asking for it!</p>

        <p>I'm a bit confused that you're being so rude towards me. Of course everything can be searched, but would a "Best Of" pinned post hurt that much? Would mean that in a matter of seconds, a new user would have an overview over all the important ressources.</p>
<p>This is not a new concept - lots of subreddits give a quick overview, so that a new person can quickly grasp what's going on. Alas, call me lazy.</p>
<p>I did not ask for you to spoon-feed me, I am giving you a suggestion after spending a bit of time here. Why that caused you to rant at me, I don't know.</p>
<p>But I guess, thank you for your input.</p>

<p>And as you're surely aware, your example is hyperbolic. It's true that there are subs who would block critical posts, but for sure nowhere near 99%, and for sure not the majority. I've made a fair share of critical posts on a number of subreddits (Not my first account), and most of them were well received.</p>
<p>If a sub would block such a post, that would be very unfortunate. I just don't know how that relates to my post.</p>

        <p>I was telling you something. You asserted that this sub dismisses different opinions just the same as others, making us hypocrites. I am telling you that is not the case. Your point of view is allowed here. Sure, people may argue with you, or be unnecessarily rude to you, but at the end of the day, your point of view is here to stay. HUGE difference. 
Now, do you have any specific points of view that youâ€™d like to bring to the table? Or did you just come here to say we dismiss other view points without actually offering any?</p>

        <p>Dude the general public is mostly pro lockdown, watch broadcasts from over the summer and late Spring, and the fall about how we need stricter lockdowns, to cancel Thanksgiving, cancel Christmas, don't you dare go out on New Year's. That is the accepted condition for people right now. </p>
<p>And I reject your assertion that we are as just biased and stubborn as the other side. I used to be pro lockdown and changed my mind because I knew I was wrong after examination and contradictions on the pro lockdown side. In my mind, the true Christian or the true believer is someone who can take an honest and thorough examination of all other beliefs or non-belief systems and after deliberation, to still say they are Christian. Have you ever given thought to the idea you were wrong? How many times have you changed your mind about anything you deeply believed in? The same holds true with what's going on right now. </p>
<p>My reasons for doubting the lockdowns and the current state of things is so, so simple because a viable solution that hasn't even been tapped by the experts is so glaring to me. WHY ISN'T SCIENCE TELLING US TO LOSE WEIGHT. That's literally it. That's the one question I have had all year that has never been answered. We have known since March this disease is really good at killing people that are either old, obese, and diabetic right? You can't change your age, but you can definitely change obesity and you can change how diabetes affects you with weight loss, diet, and exercise. </p>
<p>This death toll could have been mitigated with public health doctors telling America to lose weight, that much I know is true. Why weren't we seeing that on the nightly news? Get outside and run or go on a walk America, that could have saved some lives right? But no, it was wear a mask, wear gloves and wash hands, stay inside and close up gyms instead. Windsurfers getting arrested who were outside getting exercise. It does not make sense anymore. And given we are about to see if this vaccine even works, there needs to be a back up plan which should probably be to strengthen the health of average people if most people are going to be getting exposed to the virus as the economy opens back up.  It's such a simple, simple solution-yea it is really tough to lose weight, but this is something we have desperately needed to hear that we have not.</p>

        <p>Well yes, the general public does generally have the opinion, that lockdowns are a valid measure to tackle this pandemic. Are you right for not being "mainstream"? Is the general public wrong for not having your opinion? It was decided, that it was the safer, more usable opinion. It's not like we decided to be part of a team.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Just because an opinion is different now than before, doesn't mean that there's no bias anymore. Before you were pro, now contra lockdowns. That's not being unbiases, that's switching sides and having a different bias. </p>
<p>And that's what gets on my nerves. I am not pro lockdown. I just see it as a good measure to contain the virus. Of course I don't want a lockdown. And that's why I am talking about bias. For some, you either have to be pro or contra, which is biased in itself. I listen to what the people who know about topics say, look at  pro and contra points and then see what option has better advantages. At some point I'm going to be for stopping lockdowns, because they'll not be necessary anymore. </p>
<p>That's a stupid sports-mentality people have. Android or Apple, XBOX or Playstation, Urban or Rural. So many people can't just be unbiased, they always have to choose their side, which makes them dislike the other side. And social media only make this worse.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>People staying healthy would definitely be a good thing. But...does that have to be said specifically for COVID? Everyone agrees that people should be healhy, it's not like that's an unknown fact.</p>
<p>I also seriously doubt, that "people being and becoming healthy" is a safe, or doable plan. You can't get healthy in a couple of days/weeks. People should try to get healthy while they're stuck at home, but it's not like that's THE solution, you know.</p>
<p>Overall one of multiple good measures, but you can't just say that that's the holy grail of options we have. It's the combination.</p>

        <p>well, yes. I think I can confidently say that we are almost all biased against lockdowns on this sub. For one to see both sides of an argument, and having been on both sides, they cannot be more bias as they were once against it. I'm not anti lockdown for name of the group, I'm here for reasons that I believe I have given significant amount of thought and examination towards. It's the ideas and reasons I am attracted towards being anti lockdown/nonewnormal. </p>
<p>And yes, this does need to be said strictly about covid because it is a solution to the problem of excessive deaths and increasing hospital capacity (flatten the curve, right?) which I would say first and foremost is in line with the US constitution, (encouraging good diet and healthy eating is not unconstitutional, forcing it is however.). It is the MOST practical as losing weight costs zero additional money because all you have to do is eat less of what you are already eating, walking on the sidewalk or in a park is free and usually safe during the day time, plus getting outside for an hour is an hour you aren't in circulated air with others. and it has long lasting health effects which benefits everyone. Not to mention beneficial to mental health and clarity. If the government really cared? They would have had non stop public service announcements saying to cut the junk food, and to get exercising.</p>
<p>And I have been saying this started last year. It's the reason I was running endlessly when the virus started coming around because I wanted my body to have no issues with killing it. Most reasonable people I think would agree with that conclusion. I've lost a significant amount of weight in my life and believe me I know how long it takes. It is mid January. We have known since March of last year that the virus is really good at killing those who are obese, diabetic, and have high blood pressure. And it's really really good at killing those with all three. It's now January. That is ten months of time that we could have had to tell people to lose weight. Even on a 300 calorie deficit diet per day (a bag of chips), that's a solid 25 pounds and would take most average height people from a 30 BMI to within spittin range of normal BMI.  Even if 3% of the population followed through with that advice, how many would have been saved? Where oh WHERE has the science been on this one? Right? Isn't that what we have had shoved down our throats the past year? follow the science, follow the data? What am I missing? Tell me I'm wrong here and tell me why. It's the central reason why I do not believe this is actually about health of the people, it is about dictating control and power.</p>

        <p>Well, when the CDC puts on their website that less than 10k people have died from coronavirus alone, that's a big thing. Also, all the listed deaths that the news shows is people that died with coronavirus, not from. There is a huge difference between the two. All the new daily cases that you see are not positive Covid tests, they are testing positive for coronavirus antibodies. Unless a culture was taken, sent to a lab, isolated and tested for live Covid virus material, nobody is testing positive for Covid.</p>

        <p>Where did you find the 10k figure? </p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">this page</a>, the total death count is <strong>326,163</strong>. Did you subtract the deaths involving pneumonia?</p>

        <p>Nope, CDC had it listed on their site for awhile. Less than 10k died from coronavirus by itself. The rest had 2 to 3 serious underlying issues. Dig a little deeper and you should find it. Again, nobody has died from Covid unless a sample was cultured, isolated and tested for live virus material. These tests are testing for coronavirus antibodies. So those people that died did so with<em> not from</em> very big difference there.</p>

        <p>Yes, you saw the data. But all the articles I linked explain, that people misinterpreted the data and wrongly started spreading a false claim.</p>
<p>I did not determine that it was fake - I googled it, looked at the ressources I linked you, and saw that this is a false claim.</p>
<p>Is a random screenshot more proof to you, than 4 articles which elaborately explain, why the claim is wrong?</p>

        <p>Well, these articles say what I heard as well. They're not to protect you from others, but instead to protect others from you. That means, wearing a mask is not for your protection, but instead to protect the people around you. So, everyone has to wear a mask, because theoretically all that's needed is one asymptomatic person who's not wearing one.</p>
<p>This is from NPR's article: "[...] is right to think a surgical mask might protect strangers from picking up a pathogen. After all, the masks were originally designed to protect patients from the coughs and sneezes of a surgeon."</p>
<p>I'm currently reading through them. Some correctly state, that the virus itself isn't the worst thing. That the bacterial pneumonia, which is caused by the virus, is the dangerous thing. That doesn't mean that the virus isn't dangerous - after all, it's what causes you to develop a deadly pneumonia.</p>
<p>And sorry, but after skimming through some articles on NaturalBlaze...that's definitely not an unbiased, factual or otherwise useful ressource.</p>
<p>Very interesting nonetheless, thanks for the links!</p>

        <p>I will try my best to enjoy these things. I think if surgeons can wear masks for long operations, it shouldn't be a problem for me to wear them casually. The longest I've worn a single mask in one stretch is probably less than two hours.</p>

        <p>Have you ever tried to have a discussion with someone leaning left? When I do, all I hear is regurgitated news head lines. If I have an different opinion Iâ€™m automatically deemed a anti-vax or Iâ€™m inciting violence or Iâ€™m a conspiracy theorists and so on. Iâ€™ve given up trying to express my opinion or concerns. I wish we could look at the really issues that are a cancer in our society instead of fighting with each other.</p>

        <p>You are just talking about bad examples in a specific group :) You can find such people on every point of the spectrum, doesn't have anything to do with being on the left side. 
There's more than enough right-wingers constantly using Fox News headlines.</p>
<p>And it depends on what your opinions are I guess :)</p>
<p>If someone tells me that they don't vaccinate their kids because it causes autism - Then yes, they're just misinformed anti-vaxxers.</p>
<p>If someone tells me that jews rule the world, they're anti-semitic conspiracy theorists. Same with the people who think there's an elite slaughtering kids and drinking their blood.</p>
<p>So there are people who I'd call conspiracy theorists. But I agree with you. Generally, we should just listen to each other.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, i see your side. There are definitely people out there that are miss informed and believe in some crazy shit on both sides. I feel polarization is at an all time high and this causes people to react with out thinking. They just see you vs me. So now people are almost forced to make separate groups where they can discuss topics with like minded individuals. I wish debates could happen with out hate, unfortunately it doesnâ€™t happen much anymore and thatâ€™s a shame. Imagine what we could accomplish if there was more common ground to openly discuss and solve problems together instead of one side calling all the shots. Kinda went a little of topic :)</p>
