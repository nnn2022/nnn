        <p>Definitely not because multiple governments officials and esteemed doctors tell you. Nooo they don’t know what they’re talking about! In fact, let’s put another 100k peoples lives at risk in spite of some guy online! That sounds like a wonderful idea!</p>

        <p>And this is how the entire world has been convinced to give up their freedoms. Just follow the experts everyone says!</p>
<p>I'm about to drop some knowledge on you, and it might blow your mind, but here goes. The government and mega corporations know a lot about the populace as a whole, how they think and what tactics work on manipulating people. With big brother knowing this, surely they know that everyone trusts experts right? If they know that people like to put trust in people who are smarter than them, doesn't that open up the population to being manipulated by "experts" (read: shills)?</p>
<p>The mainstream media, mega corps and the government have everyone by the balls and they know it, so they're going to continue manipulating you and they know you'll eat that shit up. But look around you; have you seen anyone severely affected or even someone that's died from this? Do you trust your instinct or a doctor who might have his paycheck being written by someone with special interests? What about the thousands of doctors calling this a sham? Why aren't they getting a voice within the MSM? They've certainly tried but for some reason they don't want to report on it.</p>

        <p>Wow you’re crazy. Yes I have seen people impacted by this. The school where I went had two deaths of perfectly healthy young men. I don’t know if anyone’s told you this before, but I think you should maybe see a therapist. If you think there’s any organization out there that has really anything to gain from people being more sanitary other than a protected world from covid, you’re sorely wrong. If there is some big organization then they suck at their job. Last I checked, they didn’t have much power over the blm riots, the “proud boys” or really anyone in Texas. There’s no “big brother” unless you’re in China.</p>

        <p>Nah I've seen your posts, you should see a therapist, you seem broken and you're projecting onto me.</p>
<p>&rt; The school where I went had two deaths of perfectly healthy young men. </p>
<p>You're either full of shit (most likely scenario) or you have witnessed an <em>extreme</em> outlier. The death rate is so god damn low for healthy young men  that I wonder how every leftist uses this as an argument. The likely scenario is that they died for something completely unrelated and tested positive for some form of coronavirus, which almost everyone does because coronaviruses are extremely common. Or again, you're full of shit.</p>
<p>&rt; If you think there’s any organization out there that has really anything to gain from people being more sanitary other than a protected world from covid, you’re sorely wrong.

There’s no “big brother” unless you’re in China. </p>
<p>Why do you have so much trust in the state to do the right thing? And why are you blatantly misrepresenting the situation at hand? We have done so much more than "making the world more sanitary", which would be a somewhat proper response, not shutting down the livelihoods of millions and destroying small businesses while Amazon gets richer and closer to essentially running your life. And if you really don't think there's a sinister higher power that lurks in the shadows out there (AKA the deep state) then I don't know what to tell you other than you're naive as fuck and have way too much trust in the government who basically wants to be your new mommy. It's clear that you never paid attention to history in the slightest or have any understanding of the foundation of the USA and why we take government overreach so seriously. It's scary that so many kids think like you and will happily bend thy knee to authoritarians who do not have your best interest in mind.</p>

        <p>Yes, surely some silly reddit award will convince people to wear masks.</p>
<p>By the way, masks don’t work. I live in a city that’s had a mask mandate for months. I have never seen anyone without one when I leave my house (yes, this includes me. I wear my mask). Guess what? Cases ended up going up anyway. </p>
<p>Probably from the hypocrites like you who screech at everyone to wear masks and stay the fuck home while you break “the rules” regardless.</p>

        <p>I’m not taking <em>any</em> life advice from someone with a post history like yours. I didn’t even think it was possible nowadays but your life seems much, much shittier and lonelier than mine. It seems like you’re getting frustrated at the wrong people. </p>
<p>You’re so depraved of human contact to the point where you make ‘M4F’ posts, but you’re still willing to fight for these dictators that want everyone to stay 6 feet apart from each other? These “experts” don’t give a shit about you.</p>
<p>We were supposed to have our lives back after two weeks, but it’s been fucking 10 months. People are killing themselves, going into poverty, starving and losing their businesses over this, and you think wearing a mask would’ve saved them? </p>
<p>Get rid of these disgusting ass lockdowns and mandates. Stop isolating people. Stop hiding our smiles and our laughter. We’re humans, not lifeless machines. Social media will never be a replacement for real-life interaction.</p>

        <p>I have a girlfriend for starters, and if you checked my post history you would know that. Secondly, last I checked the definition of a dictator was someone who took control through military power. Now I’m no expert, but trumps lawyers don’t exactly look like they could beat anyone in a fist fight let alone a gun fight. There ain’t no dictators in America, and asking people to stay six feet apart ain’t an infringement on your rights. Protective measures to stop the spread of covid are not some cruel crime against humanity. If you’re such a snowflake that a mask is enough to send you into revolt and get you to start calling people dictators, then I wish I could’ve seen what would’ve happened if trump had gotten a second term just so he could run the country into the ground, all so I could see how yalls would react to a real issue.</p>
