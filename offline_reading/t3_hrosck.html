    <strong>I give up.</strong>
    <p><p>We're never going to have our lives back. This virus has been used to usher in an authoritarian government, and the Republicans must be in on it because they're doing nothing to stop this. Trump is a useless lump of shit. School is done, there will never be normal school again. Everything is over because no one will do anything to fight back. They just make stupid, useless Twitter and Reddit posts. In IL, our fat fuck governor supposedly lost his emergency powers 2 weeks ago in court, but he ignored the verdict and nothing has changed. The weakling Republicans have done NOTHING to fight it. No one cares about us. I don't want a "new normal", but we have no choice because nothing is being done to combat this.</p></p>

        <p>On July 4th, my neighbors had a party, wherein everyone was masked. Kids were in the pool, swimming, and playing around. All with masks on. The adults were eating BBQ (having to pull their masks to the side to put food in their mouths), laughing, dancing, etc. All masked. The worst part was that I saw no discomfort, they were all having the time of their lives. </p>
<p>My point is, people aren't just supporting masks to "save lives", they are becoming accustomed to them, and even adoring them. Even in the 90+ degree weather (it was 92 on July 4th in my area, by the way), I don't see people seeming uncomfortable save for me and my spouse, and we feel like freaks for even daring to see masks as a hindrance. </p>
<p>It does feel really bleak. Our numbers are just too small to make a difference, and the majority seem to fall into one of two camps:</p>
<p>1) This is temporary, normal will return... Even if it's <em>years</em> from now (and if it does take years, they will probably just grow to accept the "New Normal", y'know?).</p>
<p>2) The "New Normal" is better, safer. We need to just shut up, and embrace our new lives.</p>

        <p>My state has been opened for over two months and things have felt mostly normal.  But in the past couple of weeks I've noticed more and more people wearing masks, not less.  My area has never been in any danger of a major outbreak.  It really depresses me to see so many people out and about with masks on.</p>
<p>Today, Wal-Mart announced it will be making masks mandatory nationwide.  I don't see this going away anytime soon, if ever.</p>

        <p>Yes, I've noticed a huge increase in masks in the last few weeks. LDS keeps assuring everyone that there's less masks, but I am <strong>not</strong> seeing this at all.</p>

        <p>I went shopping today and people almost seemed more fearful of other people than they did in March.  For the first time, I saw a younger woman wearing both a mask and a face shield.  And she looked terrified of any other people. </p>
<p>My area seemed to be getting over the fear a bit since around Memorial Day, but the media has ramped up their fear porn again and unfortunately, it seems to be working.</p>

        <p>From at least the same state, if not the same town; can confirm.  Even though we never locked down, though, I don't really think things have felt "normal" here.  Like I've said before, I feel like our governor never had to lock down because people locked themselves down anyway.  My company refuses to open up its less-than-5-year-old building for us to come back to work again until at least October, if not November (guarantee our CEO is a big Dem if that's the case) because according to a doomer co-worker who may be the CEO (or exaggerating said quote), "we shouldn't be the guinea pigs in our industry for returning to the office"; if that's true he's basically playing chicken with our competitors to see who will "chicken out" on keeping employees away from the office.  If I was confident I could get a job anywhere else that I could work, I would totally be trying to find a new job.  I can't keep working from home for TWICE AS LONG as I've already been working from home, I get too easily distracted or too stressed out.  Half the places I know of in town are still closed or with limited hours and restrictions.  I have seen my friends only twice since March since they completely disappeared from all contact until June, because the most outspoken one was too scared of the virus until she finally came around last month.  Now, I've never been one to go out too much in the first place, but when I have it's been my way of coping with my depression and enjoying life.  Now with all these other places rolling back I'm nervous that those outlets will be gone again because I'm seeing more and more calls for our governor to do what he didn't before and lock us down.  I've seen petitions on local subs for at least mandatory masks.  And again, I wouldn't be so paranoid if I felt that these people really wanted this all to be temporary, but I don't.  I honestly believe they want all this SHIT to be PERMANENT, FOREVER, and it terrifies me much more than the virus itself ever could.</p>

        <p>I went to a kids birthday party last weekend with about 40 people and none wearing masks. They were all "regular" people. It wasn't like a gathering of anti-lockdown activists or something.  Just regular people at a party acting normal with no masks. It was awesome.</p>

        <p>Right?! It’s like, they explain how everyone is doing just fine wearing masks (even in water!) and go on to say how they feel judged for seeing masks as a hindrance. The masks obviously aren’t an issue if those people can carry on with their party unhindered.                           I get it, the mask may be a bit annoying. But, if it means possibly helping other people, then I’ll wear a mask all day every day.

        <p>It disturbs me that people are celebrating this, and chastizing <em>us</em> for thinking that wearing masks while swimming and eating is abnormal. I was just out at a restaurant today, and both parties aside from mine had everyone wearing masks while eating. Like, they would pull their masks up or to the side to take a bite then adjust the mask back into place, then rinse and repeat as they eat. I don't get why people do this, it's just extreme paranoia and, yes, a hindrance.</p>

        <p>I admit I’ve really been disappointed in this sub lately. I loved it when it first began and it provided updates, good discussion, and suggestions for what to do, but it seems in the last week or two it’s quickly devolved into a bunch of shitty memes and r/ForwardsFromGrandma type posts. </p>
<p>I think the mods need to put in some kind of quality control or something.</p>

<p>Go out and protest and write your congressman like people did back in March and April. Or is that not trendy anymore? Posting shitty memes and waiting for some republican politician to be your savior isn’t gonna get you out of this.</p>

        <p>I’m in the gun rights community and one thing I’ve noticed every time is that every time there’s proposed legislation they always talk about “city bad rural good” and how “we country folk will never surrender” and hows there’s gonna be uprisings and literal bloodshed if said legislation gets passed. But if it gets passed what usually happens is that they all bend over and take it in the ass while sharing shitty memes complaining about it on Facebook.</p>
<p>At this point I am convinced the vast majority of people enjoy the government’s dick in their ass and it’s just that some are more open or closed about it than others. “But we didn’t support this” but you sure as hell are not doing anything to stop or reverse it.</p>

<p>I've tried. Believe me. I've tried "civil disobedience" like not wearing masks outdoors, bringing over a guest when that wasn't allowed, etc. It's very difficult to start a movement by yourself. All it's done, for me, is give me grief and ongoing depression. At this point, I'm just trying to get by, maybe hoping for people to "wake up". But like I said, I had neighbors who partied with <strong>masks</strong> on, on fucking July 4th.</p>

        <p>Every movement starts off small, gotta remember that. Civil disobedience is a very doable and practical thing and doesn’t take much effort, you <em>should</em> continue to do it. Also find another person or two who feels the same way you do and perhaps go as a group to help curb the loneliness.</p>

<p>Nope. If anything, it's gained me far more enemies than not. People around here, in the NE, do not stand for that.</p>
<p>At this point, it's not worth the headaches, cops being called, people harassing me, and so on.</p>

<p>Not really. People around here are pretty obedient, and have been wearing masks outdoors even before the state mandate, and now wear them everywhere even in their cars or on bikes. </p>
<p>I still get dirty or fearful looks from people when I don't wear my mask outside. People aren't "too fearful" to come out, they are fearful of the virus itself.</p>

<p>The "Silent Majority" that has done absolutely nothing! If this "Silent Majority" exists (which I have my doubts on) then they are beyond worthless because they just follow whatever everyone else is doing, and are not complaining at all. They are just going along for the ride, not caring about the "New Normal" enough to do anything about it.</p>

<p>I've been trying to fight this in various ways since March. Check my post history if you don't believe me. Even back then, when I was one of the few "skeptics" around because everyone else (probably you included, if I may assume) acted like chickens with their heads cut off, terrified of this virus even when there was already evidence that it was a nothingburger (yes, this data <strong>did</strong> exist in March). </p>
<p>I've had to deal with your snide bullshit here, and at LDS as well, since you enjoy piling into me even when I try to have civil discussions with you. So enough of that, I guess. I should know better than to trust people like you.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t say I’ve given up, but staying optimistic that some day we’ll get our lives back is getting harder:</p>
<p>More and more states and businesses are issuing mask mandates. If Biden wins, he wants masks nationwide even though he can’t say what COVID will look like in January. Even Fauci changes his mind every 10 minutes on whether there will be a second wave. </p>
<p>Philadelphia banned large gatherings until February 2021. (Who knows what’s safer about February 2021 versus now or January but there you have it.) So cities will lose even more money and more jobs are at risk of being lost forever. </p>
<p>The hysterical social media mob is getting everything they want. All these rules are being made to cater to them. And no not all of them are high risk or immune compromised. They’ve just wilted under their beds and now expect the whole world to restructure itself around their fear, yet call us the selfish ones. (And even some at-risk people don’t want society changed to suit them and want their lives back.) So now I’m expected to not enjoy life again until a vaccine because so many whiners on Twitter are too scared to come outside? It’s also very clear that there’s no magic bullet except to let this run its course. We can stay in and wear masks, but the virus won’t go away no matter how long we stay inside or if wear three masks on our face. You’ll also never have 100% compliance with the rules, especially as a lot of local law enforcement just doesn’t want to waste their time on enforcing these mandates. Even the grocery store closest to me stopped putting someone at the door to check for masks and now just has signs up. </p>
<p>There’s still no real end game except the vaccine. We could be expected to put life on hold indefinitely while we wait for this thing. I can only hope it does come early next year, because what are we gonna do otherwise? Keep large parts of the country shut down until some underdetermined date because we don’t have a magic needle to save us? Do we do this until 2022? 2023?</p>

<p>That may have more to do with money since the city probably doesn't have the tax revenue to provide security for them, as u/brooklynferry has posited.</p>

        <p>My fear is that even with a vaccine, what percentage of the population to be vaccinated will be "enough" to consider it good? Are we going to base everything reopening on cases alone until the end of time? It is disheartening.</p>

        <p>Yep. Its pretty intense for the flu shot so....especially if reopening more normally starts riding on vaccination quotas, :/ </p>
<p>For me personally, I am an RN but currently a stay at home mom with a child who is not in daycare or school, so I'm in a low risk category for exposure. I'm young and of childbearing age so I'm extra concerned about any possible future reproductive considerations, and I wouldn't be anxious to be one of the first to get this...I might consider it in the future, but not during a pregnancy ideally simply because it's so new and it'll take years to really see how it interacts with the public. </p>
<p>My husband is almost 100% likely to have mandatory vaccination from his job, and when there is eventually (probably) a vaccine, I plan on telling him and blasting to the rooftops for people to avoid taking any meds including ibuprofen, aspirin, whatever, for a week or two before and after vaccination, since many known and emerging issues surrounding vaccines are associated with basically drug-drug interactions. Neuro issues and paralysis have occurred in people taking even lowkey meds alongside certain vaccines and I think it's highly unlikely they'll have done extensive testing alongside lots of drugs in human testing. Those issues are problems you usually see upon release of a new med/vaccine. I'd also look at possible allergens in the manufacturer's list of ingredients; in our case, corn products would be an issue. Just my 2 cents.</p>
<p>Edit: my main hope is that they emphasize getting it for people over 60 and first responders/healthcare workers, but we shall see.</p>

        <p>Same. I'm already looking at places either in the US or outside of it that are livable. Don't really care if it's in the middle of nowhere at this point. I could live anywhere and once the idiocy settles you can decide whether you want to come back or not. Christiano Ronaldo(famous football player) has moved to an island for this entire thing because he didn't want to deal with it. Obviously his island is like a resort but it made me realize he has a point. I'd rather live free with my family without a mask or fear but live in the jungle or an island than live with every modern thing in the world but live in fear. It's a logical decision to me.</p>

        <p>But this is different...the internet/social media age, virtue signaling culture, the 24/7 fake news lying media, has created mass psychosis on an astronomical scale. I want to have hope that this will all completely disappear in November, but right now I am finding it so hard to stay positive in this nightmare. The only thing that gives me hope is kind of ironic. It's the sad truth that the majority of people are mindless idiots who can literally be programmed into believing and accepting the most absurd shit overnight. Knowing this now, we know how easy it is to flip the switch. Just like they flipped the switch and programmed into this mass hysteria in March, all it would take is another psychological flip switch, and they can be programmed back in November. I say November because I am now 100% sure this is a psy op and political agenda whose main goal in the U.S. is to destroy the Trump presidency. The rest of the world was duped by China's and the WHO's lies, but they are starting to go back to the old normal in a lot of places outside the U.S. Hopefully very soon they will realize what a gigantic and horrendous mistake they made. There will be tons more serological studies that show how low the IFR of the virus is and they can't ignore them forever. It will soon become clear how moronic and disastrous this whole fiasco was, the world shitting the bed for a virus that is nothing more than a new common cold.  Meanwhile, in the U.S. the dystopia is intensifying even more and the media lies more shamelessly and blatantly than ever. There is no doubt in my mind now about why they are doing this.</p>

        <p>The entire virus is an overblown media psyop targeting the election, I wouldn’t expect it to get any better until at least November. If it makes you feel any better the fear is all artificial, most people do not give a shit about masks or social distancing outside of reddit and twitter and are only doing those things to comply with laws at stores</p>

        <p>Have a lot of them been shut down? Or are they loosing in greater numbers? The issue in Canada is that they have to prove that the measures work and are reasonable and effective based on risk. But the data and the experts they have consulted have not been revealed to the public and we are going by saying it's a violation of our human rights. This big case will set a precedent here. I'm hoping a lot of this bullshit comes out for everyone to see once the case goes to court. I guess it will ultimately depend on the judge and if they are bought and paid for by the federal government. Our country is beyond corrupt</p>

        <p>It sucks right now but things will get better in time if you don’t throw yours or other’s lives away by contracting and spreading — just protect yourself in the meantime.  After a while hospitals will be able to treat this much more effectively and there should be viable vaccines.   The hard part is all of these changes in a short period of time upending our normal way of life.  But humans adapt, things will get better.</p>

        <p>I understand where you are coming from, definitely not the childhood I wanted my 3 year old daughter to experience.  We are just trying to ride out the storm, don’t know how serious it would be if any of us got it and would not forgive myself if I was responsible for any harm to my family I might cause if I knowingly did not do everything I could reasonably do.  Hope things get better sooner than later for both our family sake.  Normal might be around the corner sooner than we think if we survive this first wave in one piece.  It’s definitely such a tremendous strain mentally and emotionally and she doesn’t know what’s going on other than “people are sick”, feels terrible.  Stay strong, stay well buddy.</p>

        <p>Thread created by a shill... No republican fan but come on, the only guy who said there will be no new normal was trump, he's borderline retarded but he's the only politician in North America that says this is a hoax and the numbers are wrong. Biden wants mandatory vaccines and masks, wants to create a vaccines task force...</p>
<p>This sub has been penetrated, 37 comments in 1 hour, 3/4 of those are from the shill accounts... Ban these shills trying to spew their venom</p>

        <p>How is he a shill? Because he doesn't agree with you? This person has been posting in anti-lockdown/mask/new normal places for a long time, and right now, he is going through a tough realization, and fears that life will never get back to normal. That is a fucking legitimate thing to be afraid of. But no, people like you feel it's okay to come in here, and insult people like OP, and then have the <em>gall</em> to accuse him of being a "bot" or a shill. You're no better than the pro-lockdown crowd, who love throwing ad hominem, and accusations of the same caliber ("WAAAAAHHHH RUSSIAN BOT", etc).</p>

        <p>Can you explain to me how it feels to be a completely brainwashed sheep? </p>
<p>Fuck everything about the "new normal" bullshit. Anyone who supports it is a pansy ass troll. Hey... Your way of life is relevant again! It's not your fault you can't get laid - can't find a relationship if everything is closed down! And you don't have to feel like crap when you see other people having fun because now NO ONE is having fun! </p>
<p>Let's teach our kids to be fearful of social interaction. And who needs exercise! Sit in front of a screen all day and play games - that makes little Johnny a HERO! what kid doesn't want tp be a hero! </p>
<p>You make me sick. Everyone who supports this is literally the cancer of the world... They are killing is. </p>
<p>But, unlike you - I don't wish them harm. I just want them to wake up and live again.</p>
