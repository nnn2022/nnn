    <strong>Gas station doesn't care lol</strong>
    <p><p>There is a big ol mask mandate sign on the local gas station door but when you go inside, most people (besides the workers) are maskless.<br>
Lots of rugged blue collar country people. Good to see.</p>
<p>You just have to test it to find out how much you can get away with. I just wear them at medical places, kids school, and the store (not trying to try Publix, I'm already boycotting Walmart lol) </p>
<p>So if you're scared of taking the mask off, you will be surprised who dgaf.</p></p>

        <p>I'm in Melbourne Australia and I didn't wear a mask to the shops, no one said anything, I think I heard some people whispering. The police drove past and saw me but didn't stop, it's supposed to be mandatory with a $200 fine. The girl at the bakery even pulled her mask down to speak. Crazy.</p>

        <p>I've been reading a lot that even at checkpoints they're not asking for the required permits. Cops here are hit and miss good guys. I've dealt with a lot on a power trip, been surrounded by 6 of them when I was just going about my business, other times they're awesome and laid back.</p>

<p>This entire time, I didn't put on a mask once. I never owned a mask in my life and I never will. I don't know what it feels like to wear a mask, so coronaphobes can't come complaining to me about how I'm a "karen" who says she can't breathe while wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Where are you? (You mention Publix so I am guessing down south...)</p>
<p>Because this is not the case in PA. My spouse and I have been stopped from pumping our gas maskless many times, to the point where we've just given up on that.</p>
<p>The only place we've been able to get away with it, sort of, is New Jersey. We pull up maskless, and the guys that have pumped the gas for us don't care if we are or not.</p>

        <p>I guess it depends where you are in PA?  I live in a northern suburb of Philly.  Lots and lots of mask wearers here in my town. But I've never been bothered at the gas pumps.  I typically walk into a store carrying a muzzle in my hand just to see who demands that I put it on.  They don't always.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I took a motorcycle trip to Kentucky. Fewer people there seemed to care about the masks, but the health departments were coming down very hard on the restaurants and stores.  I got several apologetic requests to put on the muzzle - "they're threatening to close us otherwise".  One thing that really pissed me off is that the small independent restaurants and diners were all closed, because they couldn't afford to follow the "guidelines".  I could have all the chain fast food I wanted but nothing local and tasty.  (My gut is still recovering.)  On the way home I stopped for gas in mid-PA.  Guy at the counter wasn't wearing a mask, didn't look like he ever had, and greeted me in a friendly way when I walked in without one.</p>
<p>My wife and I stayed in Brigantine NJ a month or so ago and almost everyone on the beach and on the streets was breathing naturally.  Some of the few wearing masks looked like they had other health conditions.  We chatted with a nice old fella on the boardwalk - "86! Retired cop!" he said - no mask. Didn't mention the 'rona at all, nor did he care that we and everyone else in the vicinity was maskless.  OTOH, everyone had them on in stores, and while waiting for outdoor dining - but while I was waiting to pick up food, I watched people getting seated tear their mask off the moment their butt hit the seat.</p>

        <p>Not surprised about the experience in KY. Very few people seem to want masks and social distancing outside of Louisville, but looming threats of reduced capacity or closure are keeping a lot of places in line. Restaurants in particular. But it <em>can</em> be somewhat normal, sometimes.</p>

        <p>If they're going to be militant, might I suggest a protest mask. Something so absurdly useless (I know they're all useless) that you can throw on when confronted. Piece of string with a post-it note on it for example.</p>

        <p>Wife and I recently flew from Seattle to the Bay Area and never wore masks once. </p>
<p>The only person who said something was one flight attendant when we first boarded. We simply said “we have medical conditions,“ and that was the end of the interaction.</p>
<p>All of this crap is a sham. A total farce. The only reason it works is because servile sheep bow down. </p>
<p>Just don’t wear one. Ever.</p>
<p>You have to be prepared to defend yourself, and be prepared for some people to look at you sideways. But honestly, even death stares happens less than I would have expected.</p>
<p>It also helps to have pre-loaded retorts in case somebody does say something. For the record, not a single civilian has said anything to me, ever. And I was in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>These zombies are overwhelmingly spineless cowards who only know how to run their mouth off on social media. In real life, they are scared sheep who are too frightened to confront.</p>
<p>The most effective thing I have found to do is to ask them, “are you sick?“ When they inevitably say “no,“ you then simply ask “then why are you wearing a mask?“ </p>
<p>The handful of times I’ve had this interaction, they just stare back at me blankly. Their zombie little pea-brains short circuit.</p>
<p>For those of you thinking “but you have to wear one at the store! They make you wear one at the _____ !” This is sometimes the case, but way more often than you think, it is not. Just don’t put it on your face. Walk in confidently. Summon the courage to just...not comply. You’ll be shocked how little resistance you actually run into.</p>

        <p>I’m curious what airline that was on because as I understand it the airlines are pretty strict. Several of them even removed the medical condition loophole. Otherwise you are right though, a lot of places don’t enforce it even it they have big signs at the front saying they’re required.</p>

        <p>All of them removed the medical condition “loophole”, although I dislike the term because for many of us it wasn’t a loophole but a medical necessity in order to fly at all. This must have been a few wks ago, I believe July 27th was the day they all started that. I flew the 26th in Southwest and it was the last day they’d accept a medical exemption. </p>
<p>The fact is that it’s becoming ever more difficult to just ignore it and not comply. The stores can call the cops on you for trespassing if they ask you to leave for not putting one on and you don’t, and some actually do this. Some won’t let you check out without a mask. And some have people at the door literally blocking the entrance. So while yes I’d love to just not comply and do what I need to without, the truth is that at many places this isn’t an option.</p>

        <p>The larger the store, the less of a big deal they tend to make about it, in my experience. The only place I've gotten shit for not having a mask on was at a Pep Boys, but they didn't even have the battery in stock that I paid for. So fuck them.</p>

        <p>I don’t think I’ve been in one single gas station or convenience store that actually enforced their mask order. They’re the most lenient by far.</p>
<p>Also Walmart is not enforcing it either. They have people at the entrance handing masks out and trying to get you to wear one, but if you just keep walking and ignore them they don’t chase you down or anything. I always see other people in Walmart not wearing a mask.</p>
