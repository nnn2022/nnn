    <strong>You know what I am done worrying about how others see me without a mask on</strong>
    <p><p>I used to be a loving, gentle and caring person. I still am, but at least to those I am close with or I know. I was sucked into believing that wearing a mask did the right thing. However, this was back all the way in 2020.</p>
<p>I suffered from not being able to go out and see people. Being able to make friends and socialize at a bar with some good food and drinks. Then at some point when the pandemic hit and toke me away from all of that I was stuck at home. Even if stuff was open and you wore your pointless cloth mask to the table and toke it off you couldn't socialize. The bars were shut down and tables were literally separated 6 feet from each other making it hard to want to talk to anyone. I did the mask and distancing thing not because I wanted to, but you couldn't do anything if you refused. Every store around here would refuse your entry if you tried.</p>
<p>So as life became more depressed because stuck at home it really changed me. Going from an out going person who loved to be out and about to someone who was just depressed and stuck at home. Even though I have a girlfriend and got to see her being able to do that at least stopped me from completely losing it. Even though till this day I am suffering from depression and anxiety from it. Bars are way more than just going there to drink and eat. It was the perfect way to go out and have a good time with all different kinds of people.</p>
<p>A lot of places opened that back up. Even got to see some of my friends in my local area after such a long time of not being able to. To then have to see on the news and social media that people are wanting distancing and masking. Doesn't matter if it's the mall, movies, restaurant if it's indoors they want restrictions. I thought as kids we hated getting grounded? I don't know I didn't like it. To all those people who still want mandates and restrictions just wear the freaking masks yourselves. Clearly the ones pointing out we need mandates are the ones afraid of Covid themselves so they should stay home! How can they say they are out having a good time when you can't see the person's face whom you're talking to. You're voice is even muffled and harder to hear with the damn mask on.</p>
<p>I don't get it. The folks who are maskless and want to be out are just people who want to live their lives. They want to stop being stuck at home and afraid all the time. STOP TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEM AND CALLING THEM MASKLESS ASSHOLES! So you know what I am just done. I don't care anymore if anyone else out there wants to think I am some careless asshole all because I don't wear a mask when I am just trying to go out and have a good time. </p></p>

        <p>After seeing so many "maskless assholes" walk into a store without one on I never seen someone die in a store because it was so contagious.  Heck I don't see a lot of people coughing all the time. Course you might get a couple of people but that's a minority.</p>

        <p>Haha, I remember DAY ONE that they lifted the mandates here, I went into the grocery store without one. EVERYONE looked at me like I had leprosy. I think no one got the memo that it was lifted yet. It literally felt surreal to be without a mask. I felt unchained. Fuck these people. Even after the ma date, I'll continue without a mask going forward. Not giving in to their Broadway show anymore.</p>

        <p>I can't respect a person who is willing to engage in activities that will likely prolong a pandemic and could result in the deaths of elderly people. The kind of people who worked hard their whole lives, who actually deserve to relax and enjoy a social setting in their later years. Instead, we have morons who deny science, who spit in the face of the elderly and tell them to cower in their homes while they spread a plague. Fuck that.</p>
