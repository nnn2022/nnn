        <p>yes indeed</p>
<p>â€œThe secret ballot makes a secret government; and a secret government is a secret band of robbers and murderers. <em>Open despotism is better than this</em>. The single despot stands out in the face of all men, and says: I am the State: My will is law: I am your master: I take the responsibility of my acts: The only arbiter I acknowledge is the sword: If anyone denies my right, let him try conclusions with me. But a secret government is little less than a government of assassins. Under it, a man knows not who his tyrants are, until they have struck, and perhaps not then." - lysander spooner</p>

        <p>while the state is a legal fiction, it's agents and actors are not</p>
<p>the russian guy alex sol-something wrote a 2 volume book  to warn us</p>
<p>his conclusion was that they (the russian plebs) deserved the gulags because they allowed their neighbors to be taken off a few at a time, while they cowered in fear.</p>
<p>he said they could have easily overwhelmed the small bands of police, which would have eliminated the state's frontline henchmen. and made aspiring henchmen think twice or not at all about becoming henchmen.</p>

        <p>You are aware that the only people dying from covid have pre-existing medical conditions or a weak immune system made fatal by the added stress covid puts on the body. If I am on bloodthinners and I get stabbed and bleed to death because my blood won't clot my official cause of death is the stab wound. This is much the same with Covid. If I have a lung infection or bronchitis and I catch Covid, my bronchitis is made fatal because the effects compound and end up killing me. So if you think at any point that covid isn't killing people you are not only an idiot but a disgrace to your father for not preventing deaths that could be somewhere near the same circumstances.</p>

        <p>Did he say Covid isn't killing people. Surely in a hospital full of people dying a highly infectious disease would spread around like wildfire and pretty much anyone who dies in said hospital with be a covid death regardless of whether or not covid played a part in their death.</p>

        <p>This is Zero percent factual. OP was talking about demanding stats for those who died from covid versus those who died with covid. And no for a fact Corona virus does not spread like wildfire in hospitals because of sanitation protocols such as wearing a mask. There are very few outbreaks in hospitals as covid patients are treated by special teams as to not cross contaminate between divisions. So next time instead of coming on to Reddit with no facts and a pigeons brain stuck in your head try doing some research so you can give an educated opinion on a topic rather than spewing out utter garbage that flowed from your swelling frontal lobe to your tongue. Covid deaths are only covid deaths, whether that be a previous illness complicated by covid or just covid. The cause of death is always listed as either "Covid-19" or "Complications from Covid-19".</p>

        <p>The point is to reduce the spread not eliminate it dipshit, by reducing the spread we can let people who are sick get better and not put a strain on the already corrupt and broken healthcare system. If your selfish ass would care about anyone but yourself for even a second you'd see that there are real people that are affected by your decision to wear a mask. If you just did your part we wouldn't have to have mandatory masks very long but you decided that your "freedom" is worth more than someone's life.</p>

        <p>If your government acted like the rest of the world instead of a bunch of four year old dipshits then it would save lives. Canada has CERB payments for those affected by the virus and, we have no significant new poverty because of it. As you may also know Canada has one of the highest education indexes on earth which also attributes to their ability to handle this like smart functioning human beings. Rather then bursting out crying like a 1 year old because the government is "tAkInG aWaY mY fReEdOm". So if you think for even a second it's better to just skip the lockdown rather than handle it with dignity and patience. Go ahead, seeing the US burn under political and economic pressure makes for good TV in Canada. I also look forward to Canada being the north American superpower.</p>
