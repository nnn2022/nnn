    <strong>The lockdown left's abrupt forgetfulness about Big Pharma</strong>
    <p><p>My political views skew pretty far to the left. I only mention this because so many of my fellow lefties, who a year ago would have gladly joined me in a conversation bashing the corrupt and evil Big Pharma, are suddenly championing the idea that these same companies are going to deliver us from a horrific hellscape of dead bodies littering the streets from covid.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfizer#Controversies">Pfizer is still Pfizer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna#Criticisms">Moderna is still Moderna</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca#Controversies">AstraZeneca is still AstraZeneca</a>.</p>
<p>Big Pharma has always been unethical and corrupt...they didn't suddenly become ethical because of fucking covid. They are still the same greedy fucking scumfucks they always were, except NOW, they stand to make more $ than at any time in their histories.</p>
<p>(Which also reminds me...a few years ago, when Robert Redfield was appointed CDC director by Trump, all the lefties I knew were complaining about Redfield's past and how we shouldn't trust a Trump crony...flash forward to 2020, and suddenly all those lefties are insisting "DO WHAT THE CDC SAYS, THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE BECAUSE THEY ARE TEH SCIENTISSSTTS!")</p>
<p>99% of my lefty friends now think that if I <em>simply</em> QUESTION the trustworthiness of Big Pharma related to the covid vaccine, that means I'm an uneducated scaremongering idiot who doesn't care about people suffering and dying. "But they have SO MANY wonderful scientists collaborating on the vaccines, it's an unprecedented cooperative effort to save everyone's lives, of COURSE THE VACCINES WILL BE SAFE!"</p></p>

        <p>I think that nowadays, being a leftist simply means being a brainwashed legacy media lover, because the media bashes orange man all the time and openly supports BLM/antifa terrorism. Everyone else is just a crazy right-wing conspiracy nutjob.</p>

        <p>Hey, this happens to both herds. Trump can sign the CARES Act, but if Obama did the same Trump folks would be PISSED!  Obama can drone anyone he wants as long as it isn't Bush doing it. And Bush can crush privacy and limited government with the Patriot Act.  Well, it's called "Patriot" so it must be OK, and who cares because he is better than Clinton right?</p>
<p>And who knows how many of these guys are pedos, but if they are on my team then it's not really a big deal.  </p>
<p>Oligarchy sucks. Feels real bad man.</p>
