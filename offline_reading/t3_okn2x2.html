    <strong>I can’t keep doing his anymore.</strong>
    <p><p>There are 10 active cases in Victoria, Australia and there are 6.681 million people living here as of September 2020. That mean that not 0.0001% of the state has COVID, and the chances of any of those people dying from it is so low that I won’t even bother to calculate it. The government is no threatening to lock us down again, they say it’s gonna be a snap lockdown but we all know it won’t be. I’v had to cancel catching up with my friends for the seventh time because of this, I haven’t seen them in 3 months. I had a panic attack when I heard the news today, my mental health has been deteriorating because of this and nobody seems to care, all that matters is COVID and nothing else. I’m so tired, I can’t keep doing this, every week I tell myself that it will be over soon, that I’ll see my friends on the weekend, that everything will be great and then they take it away from me. Again and again, for months on end, it’s been a year and a half and there’s no end in sight. I’m sick of all these selfish people telling me to wear a mask, get jabbed (I have a severe needle phobia), to stay inside, to give up all social interactions and live indoors forever, it’s all so tiring and I can’t do it anymore. To whoever reads this, for the love of god save us. Australia is a hellhole, we lock down over cases fewer than <em>fucking</em> 15 in a county of 6.6 million people. We legally have to sign in to a government app every single time we enter a shop or building, just so they know where we are. Make it stop, I want to be happy and see my friends again.</p></p>
