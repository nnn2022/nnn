    <strong>I’m worried about all the people who would have met new friends or significant others naturally, but now it won’t happen because of lockdown.</strong>
    <p><p>This something I’ve been thinking of for a long time. I’ve never used Tinder or online dating but from what I hear it’s pretty bad. I think a lot of people are resorting to it as one of their only options. </p>
<p>I’ve only had one boyfriend and we’re engaged now. I played softball in college and he was at one of my games. He tracked me down, got me to go out with him and five years later here we are. If we had been in lockdown, I would have never had the game or there would have never been people allowed to watch. He would have never known I existed. That thought really scares me. This reminds me of Back To the Future where Marty and his siblings fade on the photograph.</p>
<p>It makes me think about all these little interactions that won’t happen. Friendships won’t be made and relationships won’t naturally happen as often. I guess this stuff is also a good way to filter out who you want to be with. I wouldn’t want to be with someone pro-lockdown because it reflects a lot of their character. Overall I just get a little sad thinking about how I wouldn’t have met the love of my life if lockdowns were in place. It’s depressing.</p></p>

        <p>Oh yeah. Dating has been off the table this year. It's just over, it's not going to happen. I'm planning out the rest of my life by myself. </p>
<p>The writing was already on the wall the last four years with how many women in my age group have disappeared down the black hole of woke ideology and communist bullshit, but now you can add doomerism to the ever-increasing list of psychoses and pathologies afflicting the 30-year-old American female. </p>
<p>With actual serendipitous meetings pretty much over, everyone is forced into the online Human Catalog, where you can be evaluated and dismissed based on, again, an ever-increasing list of detailed and ridiculous criteria.</p>

        <p>I don't like online dating, always struggled with it. Even as a millennial. I used to be a barfly, and the last couple of partners I've had I met in person.</p>
<p>I broke up with my girlfriend of over two years at the beginning of 2020, obviously not knowing what was going to happen soon after. Since then, I've had no dating luck. It's too easy to blame c0vid but the fact is that it would be a lot easier to meet new people without the lockdown restrictions in place. I could try the hard approach in public, but that's often so awkward, especially with how standoffish everyone is right now.</p>

        <p>Single people are pretty much screwed. Online dating is absolute trash, there seems to be some resurgence in some areas that could lead to more natural dating, but doubtfully hitting on chicks in a grocery store would go well these days.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the cold approach is tough even in the best of times, in the best of situations. But with masks, and social distancing, and no fun events, and doomer mentality, it's basically a suicide mission.</p>

        <p>A guy approached me in the grocery store parking lot. I couldn't even understand him with the mask, though. Like when I caught the sound "ool," was he saying he found something cool? Asking if I'm in school? (College) Even in the very limited spaces people might try starting a conversation these days, it's almost impossible to communicate anyway.</p>

        <p>As a 27 year old woman who has been single and lonely for 5.5 years, and has hated every moment of this nightmare, the missed opportunities to meet guys and find love is the part that hurts the most 😢💔 I know there's a reasonable chance I wouldn't have had luck anyway...but there's also the chance I've missed out on meeting the love of my life and the father of my future babies. I'll never know. I hate being alone.</p>

        <p>This is me. I'm awkward. I haven't had a boyfriend in years and can't do online dating. I really need organic ways to meet people. Getting out there was my plan this year. I'm genuinely starting to fear I'll never find a husband. I imagine myself at 50 never married and single, filled with regret over never having a family.

        <p>This is exactly what I’m missing the most. Just being in a natural setting being around others my age is near impossible right now. I’m not even old enough to drive around without a parent in the other seat. (16 years old)</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for teen-only dating apps, I wouldn’t have any way to talk to other girls my age. And coming from someone thats gotten 4.5k matches on a dating app, they are still absolute garbage. It’s only useful for a self-esteem boost. </p>
<p>Nothing in this world will be able to replace those genuine, human interactions. Eye contact was my favorite thing in all my previous relationships with women, I can’t do that on a phone screen.</p>

        <p>There is going to be a <em>huge</em> dip in birthrate because of all of this, and it wasnt all that great to begin with.</p>
<p>And the solution will be to bring in lots more immigration to make up for that.</p>

        <p>Think about the Millennials - destroyed in their 20s by the financial crisis and now when they’re supposed to be having kids in their 30s, boom Corona recession. Never mind people in their 20s not meeting.</p>

        <p>It's funny, I've been thinking about this, too.  I've never been the dating type, but then, that never really mattered (introversion and Asperger's have their perks).  Then all this happened, my small but sufficient social avenues dried up, and now my brain won't shut up about how nice it'd be to be dating someone.  (How exactly it knows that is beyond me; unless it's somehow been dating people without me knowing, which even I have to admit <em>would</em> be pretty impressive).  I know I don't have what it takes, and there's a measure of comfort in that, but I, too, worry about how this affecting the more socially needy.</p>
<p>As this insanity ends- whenever that it- we're going to LOT of very-bad-idea relationships forming.  I just hope we all last that long.</p>
