        <p>I still don't understand how this could even be legal.  Hasn't gotten full FDA approval yet and still being studied.  At any rate even if you're going to mandate some people take it it has to be deemed absolutely safe first.  It's not like here's a gumball.</p>

        <p>Probably.  What I've always found funny is the msm has always been fiercely anti-Trump yet all are on board Operation Warp Speed.  Trump has recently said he put "extreme pressure" on the drug companies to come up with vaccines in record time.  Interesting that the media has nothing really negative to say about one of his signature achievements.  You'd think they would.</p>

        <p>Texas had 42 deaths as of yesterday.
Source: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/texas-covid-cases.html</p>
<p>While the situation looks stable, its also worth stating that it's stable at a high rate. There's a decrease in testing as well. And though the mandate has been lifted, not everyone went out without masks. A good portion still followed.

        <p>So two conflicting reports - choose the one nonsensical one that's most convenient.</p>
<p>"Texas reports" is not the same as facts. There were deaths. And it's not even about deaths, it's infection as well. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/florida/</p>
<p>Looking at Florida and Texas - they were basically overrun earlier without masks in effect. Remember, earlier in the pandemic? When Florida was cruising at near 20k cases/day. Now at 2.3 million cases. I definitely believe you that there is weak mask uptake. Thanks for delivering that point.</p>
<p>Masks do work. I'm talking about medical masks and it's not only aerosol transmission - though that is protected against. There's respiratory droplets as well - unpressurized. Masks are not 100%, if that's what you're saying, I'll agree with you there. But that's why masks have a rating. They reduce, not eliminate transmission.</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2:</p>
<p>"Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets....These viruses spread between humans through direct or indirect contact, respiratory droplets (including larger droplets that fall rapidly near the source as well as coarse aerosols with aerodynamic diameter &rt;5 µm) and fine-particle aerosols (droplets and droplet nuclei with aerodynamic diameter ≤5 µm)2,3." </p>
<p>Your whole argument basically lends itself to the idea that masks don't work, but cases are magically down since the mandate in Texas was lifted - like it's some epiphany that masks were causing infection and just needed to be removed. Look at the rest of the world - India for example. They just need Abbott's direction, I'm sure.</p>
<p>Masks are not the only factor. Social distancing - not the only factor. Lockdowns - not the only factor. Don't zero in on one element and manufacture a giant claim. </p>
<p>I honestly wonder who ever went into surgery and before being opened up, told the medical staff that their masks wouldn't be needed because, y'know, they know damn well they just don't work.</p>
<p>Send us a video of you walking into your local ICU and take a few selfies, maskless with people on ventilators. Come on, do it. I mean, why not?</p>

        <p>So with your mask explanation, shouldnt we be seeing people dropping like flies in florida and texas, since yknow, they arent wearing masks? Yet, there was 0-42 deaths recently. Depending on which “nonsensical” news source you want to  “choose”?</p>
<p>India has 1.366 billion people. 283k deaths reported from covid. .0217% of their population passed away from covid. </p>
<p>Usa is 328.2 million. 587k covid deaths reported. .177% of the population.</p>
<p>But hey, we can stop wearing the masks now cuz the CDC said so. Do you think the CDC is wrong?</p>

        <p>This is just the dumbest thread. Firstly, I'm in a topic that seems to encourage transmission. </p>
<p>Look, fact is, yes, we should see people dropping like flies - unless, maybe, just maybe 17.7 million doses were administered in Florida - which kinda helps. It's a small amount, but 37% of their population is a good start. On a plus, the state-run COVID testing sites will close at the end of May - which is good, because that means in June you can tell me they have 0 cases. </p>
<p>Anyway, masking is not the only factor. Again, don't zero in on one factor influencing everything.</p>
<p>I don't care what the CDC said. Also, no one is talking about that. But sure, I'll bite. They can say don't wear masks - it doesn't mean they aren't effective. All it means is, 'they said it and have reason for it'. There is no right or wrong in that. Is there justification in that? Sure.</p>
<p>The CDC didn't just say 'don't wear masks' as you enjoyed putting it:</p>
<p>Fauci added that many Americans are not reading the guidance with a critical eye (this is you, moistlysweatyy).<br>
"People either read them quickly, or listen and hear half of it. They are feeling that we're saying: 'You don't need the mask anymore.' That's not what the CDC said," Fauci said. "They said: If you are vaccinated, you can feel safe — that you will not get infected either outdoors or indoors. It did not explicitly say that unvaccinated people should abandon their masks." </p>
<p>So to your question - no. No, I don't think the CDC is wrong. But I do think you read a headline and like to stop right there. Like - don't even glance at the next word kinda stop. It helps being not fully informed. <br>
Source: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fauci-says-public-misinterpreting-latest-cdc-mask-guidance-n1268000</p>
<p>CDC even has a link out on using masks to slow the spread: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html</a> </p>
<p>As to the numbers you posted - they went through surges at different stages - USA is at the tail-end while India is at the hump. Again, 'details' without the context.  But seriously though, what are you trying to prove with those numbers anyway? You just dropped them here like a gift.</p>

        <p>You’re going to pin the 37% of people vaccinated as to the reason that people aren’t dropping like flies in the streets like they were in those videos from early pandemic China? It would seem that we should be seeing more people dropping than not according to your own percentage of vaxxed people but we arent. </p>
<p>You can take your gaslighting remarks out of this conversation thank you. You have no idea how much news I consume, and i don’t know how much you consume. This is a moot point. </p>
<p>The numbers are my gift to you. 
The numbers show that with the larger percentage of total deaths we are now getting rid of our masks that are oh so helpful in the stopping of transmission that, now, we are able to do away with them if vaxxed. However after being vaxxed, you can still catch covid. So wouldnt it be a good idea for the CDC to say, for everyones safety of course, to continue wearing the masks because its just one of many different ways to stop the spread? Oh thats right, you “dont care what the CDC said”. </p>
<p>Well, Neither do I.</p>

        <p>if they are showing symptoms of any contagious illness they shouldnt come into work but the asymptomatic transmission thing needs more discussion and scrutiny. Mike Yeadon former Pfizer employee said the risk of asymptomatic transmission is less than 1% because viral loads in asymptomatic cases are low (hence why there are no symptoms). I dont know that much more about asymptomatic transmission but it needs to be scrutinised and discussed openly and without editing by people on all sides because it's one of the main justifications for the totalitarian control of society.</p>
