        <p>Honestly good. Have an online option for those scared to return. Aside from that open schools like normal.</p>

        <p>If they must do something, take temperature at beginning of day and wash hands after going outside and before eating. Otherwise, let them have a normal school. The two above things have been done at summer day camps for my daughter and they have been doing well.</p>

        <p>Why were these ridiculous guidelines even suggested? I don't see how public schools are going to be able to pay for all this, let alone enforce it. The CDC is honestly a joke at this point, they've flip flopped their stance on so many things throughout all this mess, it's a wonder that people still listen to them. The schools should have never shut down in the first place honestly.</p>

        <p>Exactly such a joke.  And I’m so Glad the feds are pushing back on this.  It’s insane and out of control.  The idea that children can bring their own meals to school is SO DUMB since school funding is based on free lunch student ratios.</p>

        <p>You mean as taxpayers how WE are going to pay for it. If these schools aren't fully open we are still paying full taxes like normal for them not even working and sitting at home collecting gov money. They should either work or go out of business these teacher unions but aren't going to be able blackmail us.</p>

        <p>If the guidelines Trump and Pence are calling "tough and expensive" are things like. . . <em>only one student per seat in a bus, all desks must be six feet apart, lunch must be taken in shifts</em>, etc, then they're right. Those ideas <strong>ARE</strong> too expensive to implement. Limiting the number of students on a bus means that either the district would have to buy twice as many buses and pay twice as many drivers OR the students would have to be on some hybrid schedule (which brings nutty problems of its own). Trying to make students sit six feet apart means that classrooms with communal tables or conjoined desks would have to get all new furniture OR they'd have to severely limit the number of children in each class, which would mean chartering more portables and hiring more teachers. Trying to have lunch and recess in shifts would be very disruptive to the schedule AND would require each school to pay more hours for recess monitors and noon aides to supervise the kids.</p>
