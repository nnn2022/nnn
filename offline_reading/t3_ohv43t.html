        <p>99% graphene oxides in the bioweapon known as 'covid vaccines', along with nanobot components. You should look into Yerba Prima bentonite clay it's cheap on Vitacost, as well as Zeolite to collect the graphene. What's so dangerous about it? Well it cuts every cell &amp; tissue it encounters, causing micro blood clots</p>

        <p>Thanks so much!  I’ve been dealing with inflammation and it feels like I’m expelling be parasites, but I tested negative for all parasites and have normal blood/urine panels.  I’m mad at myself for even taking this stupid shot because I had antibodies (proof in blood work) after catching Covid from being a NYC commuter in Spring 2020.  Why are we destroying good data on long term antibody efficacy from natural infection by urging those who already have antibodies to just get vaccinated?</p>
<p>I was weak and caved to pressure from everyone around me to just get the shot.  I had deep concerns but I was hoping at the very least maybe it would help with my long haul covid symptoms…. I also knew deep down employer mandates were coming and I was severely depressed after a year of all the covid restrictions in New York.</p>
<p>Those of you still holding out.  Hang in there.  I can’t imagine the pressure you’re feeling but if I could go back in time I would never take this franken-shot.  This is the most fucked up a “vaccine” ever made me feel.  I normally have no reaction to vaccines.</p>
<p>I know long haul covid can be controversial, but it does exist and I’m convinced I have it.  I feel like the vaccine just made it worse not better.  I think lockdowns are a crime against humanity and that these mandates are far more harmful overall.  I know so many people who are just completely crushed mentally after 16 months of working from home without anywhere to go and needing to wear a mask if you do.</p>
<p>Pfizer‘a vaccine made my long haul symptoms even worse, and now the CEO is pushing a booster.  Even the FDA and CDC were like, slow down.  Make no mistake, it’s coming.</p>
<p>I bet vaccines passports are going to be offered to bypass some covid restrictions and the threat of a Australia/Canada style lockdown is all that needs to be dangled.</p>
<p>My employer already mandated vaccinations so even though I meet the criteria for the mandate it involves giving consent which I feel will be used against me in order to force a booster, or any other medical procedure my employer wants.</p>
<p>I’m an office worker in my 30s and find drug testing too invasive.  How many people are against drug testing but are for vaccine mandates?  Or they’ve been all “my body my choice” except when it comes to taking an experimental shot that we have no long term research on.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to wonder what exactly is Covid?  It seems and feels like it came from a lab.  It also takes forever to clear.  What if it’s more than a modified bat corona virus?  This can become very tin foily if you think about it.</p>
<p>The vaccine didn’t make me feel better</p>
<p>Probiotics and niacin (flush kind) made the most difference but I take the following daily:</p>
<p><em>Vitamin D3
Vitamin K2
Zinc
L-Theanine
</em><em>Flush niacin (Vitamin B3 - Nicotinic Acid immediate release.
Vitamin c
Elderberry extract
Turmeric extract (high curcuminoid content)
Melatonin
Additional B vitamins when performing a Niacin flush (2x daily when fatigue and inflammation is bad)
Magnesium
</em>**Kratom</p>
<p>*If supplementing high levels consider adding vitamin K2 to balance</p>
<p>**Your body will flush with this.  You may panic and think you’re having an allergic reaction.  Really do your research on this one.</p>
<p>***Legal in most US states.  Legality varies by country as well.  It does have action on opioid receptors so you can become physically dependent.  Be careful with this one.  I use it for pain and anxiety relief.</p>
<p>I also am on the following prescription medications:
These I’ve been on since 2016 for panic disorder
Prozac (Fluoxetine)
Klonopin (Clonazepam)</p>
<p>The chronic fatigue was never ending and in the Fall my doctor put me on Wellbutrin for low energy and it helped but I’m still struggling.  I don’t see how a 3rd shot is supposed to make me feel better.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor so make sure to talk to yours before making any changes to your diet, medications, supplements, and lifestyle.  Please don’t use my anecdotal experience to decide on taking supplements, however, does anyone else find it odd we’re focusing just on getting vaccines, not on actually becoming healthy?</p>
<p>There’s some promising research but it’s all suppressed…</p>

<p>This is the brand you want for zeolite, as there’s many fake ones out there. “Pure Planet, Fulvic Zeolite”, they have it on iHerb. Not your fault you didn’t know about the true side effects but the worldwide psy-op is too deep and wide. Since you’re in NY, I hope you get out of the blue states, it’s going to get really bad in this 2nd lockdown, where they’re saying they may declare martial law and all that crap. Go to banthis(dot)tv and you’ll find the real stuff they don’t want you to know. Since you know know about the shots, PLEASE do not get the ‘tests’ for it. If you search ‘John Hopkins theragrippers’, you’ll know why. There’s a site called Bitchute and if you search for Catherine Austin Fitts, she explains the entire plan very intellectually, from a banker’s point of view, she was in charge of HUD back in the day with billions of dollars in budget. </p>
<p>You’re right about the employer mandating the boosters. They will. About the coming from a lab, it’s beyond that. The germ theory was never true, it’s more of the environment. The common cold is a way for people to flush out their toxins, but they attribute it to a virus. Environment vs Germ Theory. Go to youtube and look up ‘Elena Bensonoff”, she measures the energy levels of many famous people and corporations like moderna and Pfizer, very interesting to listen to!</p>
<p>Instead of brain medications, get off them cold turkey and turn to these alternatives. Brain Tuner by SOTA instruments (look up Bob Beck brain tuner). Listen to a meditation series called Holosync by Centerpointe Research Institute, it is better. Also look up 38 bach flower essence remedies, there are many types of flowers for specific emotional issues. What prescription medication only treats via physical means for something that is emotional. It does not remove the emotional issues that gets stuck in the aura, but the flower essences does as well as spiritual work from meditation. Also, if you adjust your space feng shui, and your bed position to sleep towards a specific direction (your health direction) it can also help (look up Marie Diamond Feng Shui). If you want, give me the month and year you were born and I can help with that, or search up your ‘kua number’ and find out what’s your number and let me know</p>

        <p>The whole point of the knocking is to count the unvaccinated, not to convince anyone of anything—this sign, while well-intended, isn’t going to help. They’ll just record you as unvaccinated anyway.</p>

        <p>Simple solution is don’t answer the door.  Put up basic no trespassing signs and make sure they are conspicuous and do not answer the door.  You are not home.  You are not required to answer the door to anyone who comes knocking, don’t even talk to them through the doorbell.</p>

        <p>I can’t decide what the best course of action will be; not answering my door or telling them to fuck off. I’ve kind of always thought engaging is what gives these systems more power, but I’m disgusted that some snitch is going to come on my property asking  about my personal autonomy.</p>

        <p>Part of me thinks so too. There was a lot of talk with the contact tracers potentially showing up at peoples homes, but it didn’t come to fruition, as far as I know</p>

        <p>Fuck yeah!</p>
<p>Id use this but with a added line of text that says if they're DTF they can talk about the vaccine all they want so long as they dont mind choking on it while they're doing so. </p>
<p>Doesn't guarantee im gonna give them any information but i think this is a win win for all parties involved.</p>
