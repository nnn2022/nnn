    <strong>The Silver Lining: Parents got a glimpse of what their kids were being taught and it has awoken a lot of them.</strong>
    <p><p>I was talking to my wife last night and wondering aloud "How did all of the school districts in the country suddenly decide all at once that America was an evil racist place and decide to incorporate it into the curriculum?"  Then I started thinking about it a bit more. I'm not sure they did all suddenly implement these policies independently of one another. </p>
<p>I suspect that instead, they've been trending that way for a while, but only because of virtual schooling were millions of American parents suddenly  cued into critical race theory and the other Marxist agenda items being pushed in our schools.  </p>
<p>Now what will be done? I'm not sure. Ideally we could get reasonable freedom-loving constituents to take a greater interest in school-board elections and turn back the clock on this madness. Maybe... But we're not taking our chances with our kids. We've moved firmly into the camp of homeschooling over this past year. We've got 2 years until our oldest would have entered kindergarten, but now that ain't gonna happen.  We've getting our financial house in very good order and tightening the belt so that my wife can stay home with the kids. I hope a lot more parents do the same.  Extra discretionary income is nice, but you only get one crack at raising your kids. I'll be damned if I'm going to hand them over to a communist for most of the day during their most impressionable years.  That's how you get a green-haired demi-gender otherkin for a kid. Too much riding on this to chance it.</p>
<p>Thanks for exposing this, Covid! You're the best!</p></p>

        <p>No, sorry for not clarifying.</p>
<p>Info is free no matter what, but the legal help you need to pay for membership once eldest child reaches age 5. It is about $115 a year I think, so not terribly expensive.</p>

        <p>I graduated in the '90s. Never do I remember the US being portrayed as the "bad guy" in school. What I do remember is history being portrayed pretty matter of factly. And race never seemed to be an issue unless it was a Rodney King like incident. A friend of mine who is black, made the statement after the Unite the Right rally here in Virginia in 2017, that she didn't realize there were race issues at all. And she had grown up in the same little town she's lived in her whole life out in redneckville. Not saying there aren't legitimate issues, or that it's never been a problem, but it wasn't a constant topic you hear about everyday. Or being made to feel guilty over what your ancestors might have done. I'm so glad I chose to homeschool my kids even before covid was a thing</p>

        <p>We pulled our kids last year when our state voted to incorporate pretty radical sex education laws (yes, I recognize sex ed is needed in schools... no, I don't believe 5 year old kids need to know what a boner is). Since then, everything I've seen and heard from the public school system with Covid and race have solidified our decision to educate them at home.</p>
<p>Get them involved in things outside of the home though. We put our 8 year old in karate and regularly meet with friends, who also homeschool, in places (like trampoline parks!) where they are exposed to plenty of other kids. It's been so important to us to make sure they get out there and around other kids.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm totally with you, but please make sure you socialize them and don‚Äôt stifle them or keep them locked up because you want to shelter them. More often than not it has the opposite effect as intended. I grew up with extremely strict conservative parents and I met a lot of homeschooled kids at college. Most were either socially inept or went wild because they realized the things they‚Äôd been missing out on weren‚Äôt as bad as their parents said.</p>
<p>I went to an extremely conservative private college (because it was the only way I could get out of the house without my parents estranging me), and most of the people I graduated with are hardcore doomers and liberals because they were disillusioned with the church/conservative values. I happened to arrive at a libertarian mindset in spite of my upbringing, but most of my peers just went the other way.</p>

        <p>A series of weird situations with the school during Covid made it suddenly apparent how little our kids actually mattered to the school district. Individual teachers tried, but policies were clearly not concerned with education or the well being of the kids. We spent the last 30 years talking about limiting screen time and the importance of interactions, and suddenly threw it all away. We pulled most of them out in favor of home school and probably won't go back. My oldest stayed in middle school because he was too attached to the program he's in.</p>

        <p>It all started with the zero tolerance policies and anti bullying policies they basi slly taught kids to not stand up for themselves but to run the administration to handle it.  And if you did defend yourself they would use the zero tolerance shit to  criminalize and remove any students with backbone.</p>
