        <p>Yeah I recently started thinking that woke ass phonies are gonna start "discovering" the bad things about lockdown and start making empty instagram posts about it. I even have faith that Covid tyranny will become more subtle, like how we still have the TSA, the Patriot Act, and massive middle east presence despite the fact the woke ass phonies decided the Iraq war wasn't hip anymore. Who won in the end? Corporations, specifically Palantir, yeah you big tech. </p>
<p>Once the Covid hysteria dies the media and corporate America have still won. They have erased Trump, small business is destroyed. Biden has started a tech task force of ex big tech CEOs, censorship is normal now, and like you said social media has a gold mine of data on people and how they think and act. The oligarchs know EXACTLY how to control people. We must pray contact tracing does not become commonplace like the TSA.. at that point tech has you by the balls.</p>
