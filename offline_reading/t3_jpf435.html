    <strong>Contingency Plan Online: NoNewNormal.Win</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone. A feeling of impending doom wraps around us. Our thriving community is growing by over 100 members a day, but the threat of it being dissolved by the admins is all too real. More and more anti covid subreddits are being banned.</p>
<p><strong>It's official.</strong> <a href="https://nonewnormal.wi"><strong>NoNewNormal.Win</strong></a> <strong>is online.</strong> </p>
<p>The forum is completely fresh and categories are based off of this subreddits already successful formula.</p>
<p>I don't expect this to get big anytime soon but I encourage everyone to participate a little bit and make it known in the community. We need a place to go if this place gets banned... and that is very likely to happen. It has been talked about lots and nobody has done it. </p>
<p>Moderators: Feel free to message me after you create an account and you will be promoted to moderator on this website as well.</p>
<p>You can access the site with the Discourse app on your phone as well.</p></p>
