    <strong>If Covid was like Ebola...</strong>
    <p><p>If Covid was like Ebola then I could actually understand the hysteria about hemorrhaging and bleeding out of your every orifice and having a 75% chance of death. I just can’t understand why people are so scared of a flu? And this was before they even knew it was a bio weapon. I understand maybe the first 3 months your scared we have never been locked down before. But by then I was extremely worried about the economy and how I was gonna pay my bills. I just don’t understand the Branch Covidians.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly, this is nothing to be afraid of. Even in the case that there WAS an ebola outbreak or even worse, it still wouldn't be okay to take people's rights. I imagine lots more people would stay home, but the government still shouldn't have the right to tell everyone that they need to change the way they live their lives, especially not this far and especially not for as long as this has gone on.</p>

        <p>I think if this was even a 10% death rate, I would be home-bound and limiting contact with people for the duration. I can't imagine most of us wouldn't.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't because 10 percent still isn't much and it's not like every time I would be around people I would be "risking myself." If I get something, that's just how it goes.  But probably more people would stay home.</p>

        <p>10% would mean everyone would know a few people who had died, and many who had been very sick.</p>
<p>It would be a real pandemic. IMHO</p>

        <p>Yeah I told my stepmother (who isnt a liberal but has some health issues) to stop watching the news and she got all upset. She talked my dad into getting it. I hope it was worth it. He moved 4 hours away as well and I never got to see him last Christmas because of her hysteria.  And now I dont really wanna be around him face to face because of the virus shedding.  I've had some interesting side effects since my hairdresser got the vax.</p>

        <p>It's the fact that the average person is an idiot that watches TV and believes this is some deadly virus and that nothing out of the ordinary outside of what they are told is going on.</p>
<p>If your TV and newspaper tells you this is serious, you'd better listen. Okay?</p>
