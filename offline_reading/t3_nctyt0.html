    <strong>I Don't Need The Vaccine For a "Disease" of 99.7% survival rate. In Fact, No Healthy Person Needs it. It's That Simple.</strong>
    <p><p>You doomer clowns, just go on r/covidvaccinated and see for your blind selves. Literally, every other post there is about the harmful side effects of this rushed "vaccine" which people have been experiencing for more than many months now. How fucking stupid you have to be to inject yourself with a rushed "vaccine" for a so called "disease" which has a 99.7% survival rate?</p>
<p>Are you that fucking dumb? Basically, you people's logic is, "We should gamble and take a vaccine who's long term side effects aren't even known, because it will save us from a virus which is already guaranteed that will save us 99.7%." This is your logic. And what's your argument to us? If we dont want this what I like to call "slave mark" (in regards to obedience to your master fauci). "B-b-but you'll spread the virus to other people!" You little fucks are telling Me that when this is the same vaccine you have been proudly fantasizing and injecting in yourselves with, which never even got approved by the FDA! Yes. And yet, I'm the conspiracy theorist? </p>
<p>The vaccines that you are worshipping are causing side affects in people, and you want to know the funny part? The long term affects aren't even fucking known! You guys praise science that they have made a vaccine in less than a year, yet even FDA didn't approve it. And to add final nail in the coffin, even Pfizer's CEO still hasn't gotten his fauci ouchie yet. When in fact him being the CEO he should have gotten it first. You guys lack simple common sense. </p>
<p>All this that's happening is a joke and an overblown meme virus. It was never about a virus, rather all these mandatory vaccines and again I'll reiterate for a fucking "disease" that has 99.7% survival rate is not justifiable. At all. All these lockdowns, destruction of the economy, people losing jobs and mental sanity has ruined more lives than this "virus" itself. You doomers are just being lab rats for fauci and the government, and obediently giving away all your rights thinking the government actually gives a fuck about you. They don't. If they did, they wouldn't have destroyed the economy, kids/adults mental sanity in staying locked at home all day and fearing each other. Where I live, you can't even buy clothing or a pen anymore as it all comes under "non essential" items. Wtf does a pen have to do with all this? It was never about a virus. It's all about control. Wake up before it's too late doomers.</p>
<p>Economic destruction, skyrocketing inflation rates, more restrictions and control is just on it's way.</p></p>

        <p>No reason for me to make myself sick for a week to protect myself from a virus that won't/didn't make me sick at all. Especially when the "immunisation" is untested and of no certain efficacy. The only thing certain about it is that big pharma will get their payout along with the kickbacks the politicians get for pushing it through.</p>

        <p>Sick for a week ahahaha</p>
<p>You really are living in a bubble. I was "sick" for an hour at most. Mildest cold you ever had was worse than symptoms I had from a vaccine. Similar to all the people I know that took the vaccine. In fact, I don't know anyone who got sick from it seriously while I know people who died form COVID and were actually sick fro weeks. Some were very young and healthy.</p>

        <p>Well that's unimportant because everybody's experience is different. I know people who died and who wouldn't otherwise. Wil this change your opinion? Probably not. Just like yours doesn't change mine. The only difference is that I've based my opinion on statistics and data not personal, biased, narrow experience. Data and statistics show vaccine to be milder and safer than the virus itself.</p>

<p>Uhhhh</p>
<p>Data shows the WuFlu isn't deadly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death.</a></p>
<p>The death classification system is broken.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/feds-classify-all-coronavirus-patient-deaths-as-covid-19-deaths/">“The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,” she added.</a></p>
<p>Causing gunshot wounds to be a WuFlu death.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kmov.com/news/colorado-coroner-calling-out-how-state-classifies-covid-19-deaths/article_297e3550-4131-11eb-9f01-ffe3e11d0f46.html">The Grand County, Colorado coroner is calling attention to the way the state health department is classifying some deaths. The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.</a></p>
<p>Even in Canada.</p>
<p><a href="https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown">https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown</a></p>
<p>&rt; The daily pandemic death counts in Ontario include people who have  tested positive for COVID-19 but have not necessarily died from the  virus.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The exact number of people who fit into this category is unknown by the government and not even being counted.</p>
<p>&rt;“The mortality data sent to the Ministry and reported in (Ottawa  Public Health) dashboard/reports represents the number of Ottawa  residents with confirmed COVID-19 who have passed away,” an Ottawa  Public Health spokesperson explained via email. “It does not indicate if  COVID-19 was the cause of death, and we can’t make that inference.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;According to local health units, this reporting process is required by the province.</p>
<p>Mask mandates didn't do fuck all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm">"Mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease [...] in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1–20 days after implementation and decreases of [...] 1.8 percentage points [after] 81–100 days."</a></p>
<p>And lockdowns didn't work.</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13484">While small benefits cannot be excluded, we do not find significant benefits on case growth of more restrictive NPIs. Similar reductions in case growth may be achievable with less restrictive interventions.</a></p>
<p>The data has always been against the dystopia you've supported.</p>

        <p>High suicides up to 800%</p>
<p>http://fox17.com/news/local/feeling-the-pressures-of-the-pandemic-suicide-hotlines-see-800-percent-spike-in-calls</p>
<p>If America saw an equal spike in suicides, that would be 300k dead alone.</p>
<p>Then you have the alcoholism, obesity, drug abuse, spousal abuse, child abuse, poverty, increased crime, violent riots, etc. It adds up quickly. </p>
<p>The average WuFlu death has 4 other comorbidities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death.</a></p>
<p>It's possible people died 6 months sooner due to the fact they, on <em>average</em>, would have had the WuFlu, Obesity, Diabetes, cancer, and a stroke, or a similar spread of 4+ comorbidities.</p>
<p>And given that's the average, people also had 5, 6, 7 or more comorbidities equal to or in greater numbers then those with 1, 2, 3. </p>
<p>With the current reporting, if you had Cancer, Diabetes, Epilepsy, Obesity, AIDS, cardiovascular issues, and a history of strokes, but also had the WuFlu, and then you died, they'd blame the WuFlu.</p>

        <p>Covid surivability rate worldwide is estimated at <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13554">99.85%</a>.</p>
<p>For the US it's lower at 98.2% (I did the math myself from the CDC's data - 24,441,351 people have been recorded as having contracted COVID-19, 445,681 people have been recorded as dying). </p>
<p>If you exclude <em>just</em> 80+ people it jumps to 99.99%. Maybe dumping COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes wasn't a really good idea!</p>

        <p>Exactly. You know, if this was a real vaccine, and actually stopped infection with no serious side-effects, I could see why people would want to take it. I still wouldn't, personally, as I don't need it. But for those who did, I totally get it.</p>
<p>But because there's all these problems with this fake vaccine, it boggles my mind how people just blindly accept it.</p>

        <p>I had this thought too. Then I asked myself, At what "survival rate" do you figure it's safer to get a vaccine than let a pandemic go unchecked?  95% 90% 85% 80% ... 5%?</p>
<p>I followed up with: this "99.7%" (this is at the far end of the hopeful number. Numerous studies throughout the last year estimate the IFR to be between 0.5% and 1.2%, but in Europe, where testing coverage is very high, the known-IFR  hovers between 1.5 - 3%. A paper I cite below says survival rate is 99.05% so, let's go with that.): does it consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) your age, obesity, gender?</li>
<li>(b) sick-time from a typical symptomatic case? (4 - 7 days)</li>
<li>(c) hospitalization for 2+ weeks for the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934321000991">approximately 7%</a> of those infected?</li>
<li>(d) hospital capacity, including ICU beds and ventilators? When capacity is full, more die.</li>
<li>(e) <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-many-people-get-long-covid-and-who-is-most-at-risk-154331">risk of being a long-hauler</a> (roughly 80% of those who get hospitalized)</li>
<li>(f) risk of re-infection <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00575-4/fulltext">(0.65%)</a> versus infection after vaccination <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2101927">(0.1%)</a></li>
<li>(g) the most important figure, but hard to quantify: the likelihood you will spread the virus to someone you care about.</li>

        <p>I missed your response. You're mostly misinformed on both counts.   </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Death counts: indeed the data are dirty, but the dirtiness does not statistically affect too much the IFR or CFR.  Further, the dirtiness is on both sides of the count (undercounting and overcounting).  The miscounting depends on region and country. In places where the death toll is high, there is more <em>undercounting.</em> That's because in such places, tech is less advanced, there is less time, and why bother testing someone who's already dead.  By contrast, in places where the toll is lower, it's probably due to better healthcare, better technology, more time, and to the extent there is overcounting. Note, that doesn't mean "where health-care is excellent, there is higher overcount". Italy has an excellent health-care system, but because they were hit so hard and early, only about 54% of COVID-19 deaths from last March were reported as such.<a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2020/number/3/article/common-pitfalls-in-the-interpretation-of-covid-19-data-and-statistics.html">[1]</a> Belgium and other countries attempted to compensate for this undercounting by possibly overcounting. A good measure is by looking at <em>excess deaths</em>. In most countries affected by COVID, excess deaths indicate that undercounting as occurred.   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>False negative rate greatly outnumbers the false positive rate. First, false positives of a PCR test are practically immeasurable. That's not saying false positives cannot happen -- certainly they can, due to equipment handling error, false labelling,  etc. PCR machines have two control vials to ensure the machine itself works correctly. But there's no practical way of refuting a positive PCR test except with multiple subsequent PCR tests. And because the false negative rate is relatively high, you cannot really know which is which for sure unless you have positive clinical signs of disease (ie, X-Rays, sepsis).  The only way to catch one for sure is to divide a sample, store the second sample and re-test only if the first is positive. That's fine for athletes and cancer patients, but totally impractical for a pandemic. <br>
By contrast, false negatives are somewhat measurable and have been estimated to be as high as 60% in a clinical setting (by comparing it to x-rays and multiple tests).  The reason false negatives are higher than false positives is because the samples come from mucosal passageways which don't always have viral particles. The BAL method is the gold standard, but acquiring such samples basically requires the patient to be unconscious. <br>
A really really really great summary and scientific explanation of the above can be <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2015897">found here.</a></p>

        <p>Litterally neither of that is true.</p>
<p>Death counts are heavily over reported, with only around 5% being a true death from the WuFlu. The other 95% have an average of 4 comorbidities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death.</a></p>
<p>Call me crazy, but if you have Cancer, aids, diabetes, and epilepsy, I'm not going to be convinced you died of the WuFlu. </p>
<p>Not to mention the fact gunshot victims have been categorised as a WuFlu death.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kmov.com/news/colorado-coroner-calling-out-how-state-classifies-covid-19-deaths/article_297e3550-4131-11eb-9f01-ffe3e11d0f46.html">The Grand County, Colorado coroner is calling attention to the way the state health department is classifying some deaths. The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.</a></p>
<p>Like, they even admitted it off the bat.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/feds-classify-all-coronavirus-patient-deaths-as-covid-19-deaths/">“The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,” she added.</a></p>
<p>You do not need to die from the WuFlu to be a WuFlu death. You never have needed that basic requirement.</p>

<li>I'm guessing that one of the six times I had cold or flu like symptoms over the last year was covid, so I'm good.</li>
<li>I owe those who instigated, enforced or cheered on the lockdowns nothing.</li>
<li>Nobody cared about my health or well being over the last year. Why should I care about other's now?</li>
<li>The vaccine passport and other attempts at coercion is good enough reason to resist it outright.</li>
<li>I've had no say in the matter as the free world has turned into a totalitarian dictatorship. I'm taking this chance to vote NO.</li>

        <p>You doomers want to save 95 year old grandma who already lived her life, for her to live couple months more while sacrificing your own. That's your logic.</p>
<p>People die every day. Live with it. If they don't die of covid, they'll die of something else. No 1 lives forever. Be practical, rather than emotionally submitting to whatever your master Fauci and the government tells you.</p>
<p>You people are the type, if the government was to say, "jump off a cliff and you'll never get covid" you will race to do so. That's how illogical you are. And I'm tired of the same petty old arguments that you people bring. For .03% people dying, destroying the  economy, jobs, mental health of our children and kids and everything, doesn't make any sense if you have any logic. And the average people dying like I said are 70 plus who already lived their lives. And most who have died from this "deadly" disease are the people who are fat, and who had already had many pre existing health conditions with weak immune systems.</p>

        <p>Please tell me what you are personally doing to end world hunger? 
More people die to starvation than Covid has ever killed. 
While you’re at it answering that, what are you doing about obesity and cancer? Heart disease? What are you doing to stop those deaths?
How about the suicide rate that skyrocketed due to lockdowns, lost jobs...what did you do? </p>
<p>If you’re going to go on about “caring about people dying” then be real.</p>

        <p>The people who are scared of the virus are more than welcome to get it. And once you have it, why do you care what anyone else does? Does the vaccine protect you or not? If it does, Then move on with your life. But if as a vaccinated person, you are STILL scared, then your faith in the shot isn’t real. It’s just pedantic virtue signaling or a desire to control others with no legitimate reason to do so. My body, my choice, right?!</p>
