        <p>No he doesn‚Äôt and neither do you. Vaccines aren‚Äôt immunizations, if vaccines work you can still catch and pass on a virus. Unless you want everyone mandated to get vaccinated, then it‚Äôs possible to transmit the virus still amongst the non vaccinated population. There has to be a certain portion vaccinated to counteract this. To keep an epidemic outbreak again from happening of non vaccinated people there has to be a certain percentage of the population vaccinated otherwise too many catch the virus and if severe symptoms arise death or problems arise aka a pandemic. Immunizations wipe out the disease, which is why you don‚Äôt see pandemics of diseases with immunizations like the measles, except when a large population of unvaccinated people live in a community together (higher percentage of unvaccinated/immunized) and someone catches it (Disneyland outbreak, unvaccinated kids getting measles).</p>

        <p>I agree that people have from disinformation. Whether this is on purpose or not I can‚Äôt say. But I will say that these are facts about vaccines and immunizations. And the Covid and H1N1 are vaccines. So if Chris Cuomo‚Äôs dumbass calls it an ‚Äúimmunization‚Äù and people start spreading it, I can‚Äôt help that. It‚Äôs like the whole ‚Äúdo masks work?‚Äù Question. Scientifically, yes. But due to disinformation by not consistently telling the public that mask hygiene is essential for them to work (discard mask after leaving every public place, discard mask into biohazard bin, don‚Äôt really use masks, don‚Äôt touch masks and if you do change immediately) It‚Äôs moot. They just started saying ‚Äúwear a mask, any mask! Wrap a shirt around your face‚Äù and that‚Äôs just not scientifically beneficial.</p>

        <p>Well the reason you have to wear a mask after vaccination is because these aren‚Äôt immunizations. They neither make you immune to the virus nor immune to passing the virus. The purpose of the emergency use vaccines is to lower hospital rates, these vaccines can only rid you of severe symptoms or death by (insert vaccine percentage). You still can catch and spread Covid 19 even if vaccinated. The same goes for any flu vaccine you receive yearly. That‚Äôs why you will have to get a yearly vaccine like the flu, the antibodies of these vaccines only last 6-8 months. These aren‚Äôt immunizations like chicken pox or measles where you get a shot as a baby and that‚Äôs it for life. Maybe one day they‚Äôll have one of those, but for now the vaccines available for emergency use are not immunizations. Hope this clears it up for you.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm not getting vaccinated and don‚Äôt wear a mask unless mandated by stores where I live. I don‚Äôt want mandates of masks or vaccines. But denying old science just makes you look like a nutter on here where even most of us feel like one to many others. It‚Äôs okay to question this new normal stuff, but it‚Äôs illogical to deny proven science backed by years of data (unlike masks and Covid restrictions), which is why I personally don‚Äôt go along with them. Maskers and ‚Äúexperts‚Äù today are politicizing this and have no data to back their assumptions and tyrannical overreaches.</p>

        <p>Not bug. Guy, you asked why you have to wear a mask when vaccinated. I told you why they want you to, that is their answer, that is the ‚Äúscience answer‚Äù which is the only answer that can be given as to why the liberals are pushing it. That is why, it‚Äôs a vaccine not an immunization. You never questioned flu shots before I‚Äôm sure. It‚Äôs not hard to understand that you can still spread a virus with vaccination. That goes for lots of viruses including the yearly flu. These are not immunizations (immunity) these vaccines, they reduce the symptoms and mostly keep catching it from resulting in death. That‚Äôs not even conspiracy, and if you never questioned the H1N1 flu vaccine for the same reasoning then you‚Äôre just another reason why people on this sub like myself aren‚Äôt taken seriously. Vaccines still allow you to catch and spread a virus. Immunizations grant you immunity. Measles/ other diseases, immunization. Flu viruses, vaccine. Just because Covid is being politicized currently does not make all science prior moot or irrelevant, it actually makes it more prominent and less manipulated. This knowledge has been known for some time now much before the political players you see today came into effect.</p>
