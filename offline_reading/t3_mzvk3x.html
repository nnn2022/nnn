        <p>This is after having almost no cases this whole time. Then once they start vaccinating people. They then have a big increase in cases. Starting to see a pattern?</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t look too much into it. India and China would obviously have the most cases and most deaths if 1. India had the infrastructure to test, 2. China didn’t lie about their numbers. What we are seeing in these smaller countries is them creating an infrastructure to both test and vaccinate, and ironically exposing the virus to rural people who were probably safe from it. If every country could test like the U.S. it would better demonstrate how well the U.S. has done this entire time. Right now we just have to compare with other nations who have a good infrastructure, and even then it shows we are still doing well.</p>
