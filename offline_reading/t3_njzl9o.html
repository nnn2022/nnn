    <strong>There Is No Going Back. You're Here Forever.</strong>
    <p><p>Many of you on this sub are just starting your journey. Coronavirus, more specifically, the narrative around coronavirus, has opened your eyes to something that cannot be unseen. <strong>The Truth.</strong> </p>
<p>You are now painfully aware that there are blatant mistruths permeating through our society that you are not only not allowed to question, but that most people do not question. These lies that have penetrated every level and every section of western society such as, politics, race, crime, sexuality, gender, foreign policy, medicine, and everything else you can think of. These are outright lies, and they serve as the pillars of our New Age and Post-Truth society. If I mention them even in passing, my account runs the risk of being auto banned and deleted by algorithm. </p>
<p>This sub will be deleted soon and so too will the most avid posters. You had the gall the question the lies you've been fed your entire life, to question the new normal, to believe the Truth, and for that you must be crushed. You will be ostracized and ridiculed by the sleeping masses for believing obvious truths for either the rest of your life, or until the entire system, government and culture of the modern Western World is torn down and rebuilt, or, more accurately, restored. </p>
<p>This is your life now. There is no going back. You will soon find the Truth to be a backbreaking weight to bear. You will discover the pain of being seemingly the only person you know who can read between the lines, the only person that can breath while everyone around you is drowning in an ocean of lies. You will resist the truth, you will stop seeking it out, thinking this will take your mind off the painful reality of being awake while the crowd sleep walks around you. You'll unfollow everything on social media that preaches the truth, you will stop looking at political YouTube videos, you will stop doing research, you may even delete all of your social media accounts. You will insulate yourself entirely from reality and pretend things cannot truly be the way that they are. We have all gone through that phase, possibly multiple times, maybe even for years at a time, but we all came back. The truth cannot be unlearned, your eyes cannot be closed again, your ears will never again tune out the truth, your heart will always yearn for what is hidden. I cannot help but see the similarities between the mass awakening the coronavirus has caused and a religious experience.</p>
<p>I am a Christian. There is a saying in most mainline Protestant denominations that goes like this: <em>"If you take one step towards God, God comes running."</em>  This phrase means to say, that the moment a person exercises their free will, with any degree sincerity, to so much as entertain a fleeting thought to accept Jesus as their Savior , then it is finished. The Holy Spirit takes hold of you and seals you forever. You can resist, you can sin, you can outright rebuke God, but you can never go back to the person you were before. Not forever. It is even written in the Bible that most people will fall astray, most people will try to go back, most people will fall to sin again, but none of them are lost forever. Even the Apostle Peter rejected Jesus three times, but was unable to deny the truth forever. So long as they believed with genuine faith the size of a mustard seed then they are sealed for all of time. When you make the decision to accept the ultimate truth of the universe, even if you are plagued with doubt at the time, that decision is final. Your eyes are open that they will never close again, your ears are listening that they can never tune out the truth again, your conscious will never again be quiet that you don't hear God's Voice, your heart will never go cold that you don't feel the Spirit. What has been done cannot be undone by any force in the infinite universe, not even by yourself.</p>
<p>You may not recognize it now, but when you made the decision to believe the Truth regarding our current situation you made a permanent, irreversible, life changing decision. You have become a truth seeker, and that cannot be undone by anyone, not even by yourself. This is the true meaning of freedom. The freedom to know, the make your own decisions, to have your own thoughts, to be your own person, to not let the misguided mass decide what is best for the individual. This is true freedom. It can be isolating, it can be crushing, it can be distressing, but it is the truth. You are a changed person now, you are addicted to the truth. True freedom it is a dark intoxication that will never go away. There is no going back.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid. Come with me, brothers and sisters. Let me show you how deep this rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p>Remember. You're here forever.</p></p>

        <p>For me it was 9/11 - Loose change, Zeitgeist - the money masters, ring of power etc etc - and ever onwards. This is not new - the quality of awareness of the masses; what ever it is, it always has been so, and that quality of awareness is something integral to civilization itself - such has it been from the beginning - I mean it is not just Covid - 19 - it is, and always has been, everything. It is all just stories. We do not need to know anything. We never have - and we never shall.</p>

        <p>I disagree. I see through the illusions of this world without religion. You don‚Äôt need religion to see it. But you do need to be open spiritually to see it. There is so much more to this life than what meets the eye and I 100% believe there are dark forces against us physically, emotionally, soulfully, and spiritually.. it‚Äôs very blatantly obvious. I am not hating on your religion. I just believe it‚Äôs bigger than religion beyond our comprehension.</p>

        <p>I never quite got the hang of following everything the media told me.  I believed more of it when I was younger, way back in the 1960s and 1970s.  I also accepted the first layer of "limited hangout" back then - that there were Noble Journalists who idealistically took down Richard Nixon, for example. Nixon was a bastard for certain but I never really thought <em>any</em> president was honest and upright (though I will always have a sentimental soft spot for Thomas Jefferson).  Later I realized that the killing of Kennedy was the "Coup of '63" and that the intelligence services took Nixon down for their own reasons.</p>
<p>As the years went on, and I read many more books of less "conventional" history I began to see that most of my mental frameworks of how the world worked were simply implanted in me by school and media. Not one of the wars we fought were for the reasons we were told.  But it still seemed to me that there were some things which I could hold on to, and fight to preserve - the scientific method, better education, political reform.</p>
<p>Watching the disciples of Bernays sell the Iraq and Afghanistan wars by completely bamboozling most of the population finally dropped the scales from my eyes.  Even some of my intelligent friends suddenly started supporting war without even clearly understanding why, and when asked, could only mumble "we have to support the President".  We understood the danger of commercial advertising but didn't realize that <em>everything</em> in our lives, we learned from some form of advertising. Most scientists sell themselves for grant money, we have a massive research replication problem, unfalsifiable theories, P-hacking, what have you; and the few remaining diligent and honest scientists are entirely shouted down and rendered invisible by claims of "consensus". </p>
<p>Hardly anyone I speak to understands just how pervasive the pharmaceutical industry's influence is, or the insane amount of money they rake in.  They donate more to political campaigns than virtually any other industry. They are totally the masters of the WHO and the CDC and most other countries' health agencies. Almost all medical schools are allopathic and most of what they teach is how to use pharmaceutical products. Doctors are bombarded with directed advertising, paid junkets and other in-kind compensation for writing prescriptions for in-patent meds. Television and print media get the majority of their advertising revenue from pharma advertising ("ask your doctor if this pill is right for you"), so their editors won't even consider running a story which would bite the hand which feeds them.</p>
<p>It is good to be truly religious and I do find more truth in my worship than anywhere else, but we can't ignore that many organized religions are running their own kind of hustles.  It is vitally important to believe that all people have equal rights and dignity, but most of the civil rights organizations have been taken over by grifters.</p>
<p>Virtually everything today is a hustle, a grift, a scam.   This was mostly true in the past, but now I think we're reaching the corruption event horizon.</p>

        <p>Oooooh Yeah son you better believe. Mods on the coronavirus sub are already fuming. You know Reddit Corporate is the same way given their history of draconian crackdowns. There's already multiple subs dedicated to getting this sub banned. Literally called NoNewNormalBan. It's happening</p>

        <p>Incredibly well put my friend. This entire ‚Äúevent‚Äù has changed me forever. You‚Äôre absolutely right. I used to be a staunch atheist, but I‚Äôve come to realize my arrogance. I never believed there was true evil in this world until recently. I‚Äôve always known that what is being fed to us is not the truth, but I never knew how big this really was. Anytime people would start to talk about Jesus or anything religious in the past, I would automatically shut down from hearing anything they said. I had already made up my mind through intensive study of all the sciences that there could be no way anything in the Bible could be true, but I was completely and utterly naive, arrogant, and blinded. We‚Äôve been lied to about almost everything our whole lives. The lies become our reality. We as people need to drop our egos and false sense of superiority if we ever intend to see the truth. I don‚Äôt know what god is, or where he or it is from, if he/it will return, or if we are even capable of knowing; and that is the most freeing feeling I‚Äôve ever had. I appreciate your words. We‚Äôre all in this crazy place together.</p>

        <p>Better late than never, brother. God doesn't resent the lost. Put your faith in the Cross and not man. Ask Jesus into your heart, and every stain will be washed clean. </p>
<p><em>Hebrews 8:11 - 12</em> </p>
<p><em>"And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor</em><br>
<em>and each one his brother, saying, ‚ÄòKnow the Lord,‚Äô</em><br>
<em>for they shall all know me,</em><br>
<em>from the least of them to the greatest.</em><br>
<em>12 For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,</em><br>
<em>and I will remember their sins no more.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Be careful in the modern Church. Lots of Calvinists around these days. Christian equivalent of the medical tyranny discussed on this sub.</p>
