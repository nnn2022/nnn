    <strong>Mask compliance at work</strong>
    <p><p>I dont know what to do, I work in a corporate office that previously followed the CDC guidance on vax mask mandates, and are still following them despite the flip flop. The issue is that even while sitting at our desks...socially distanced, we have to wear them all day now Vaccinated or not.   </p>
<p>Im working on drafting an email to HR to protest and here is what I have so far, any input is welcome.  </p>
<p>The recent mask mandates for work, despite social distancing etc make no scientific sense (1), and even based on CDC’s recent suggestion is contradictory to their own ruling even 1 month ago (2). I will not wear a mask all day at my desk. Breakthrough cases remain at .004% of the total vaccinated population (3), making infringing rules on exceptionally rare cases is nothing short of insanity. </p>
<p>If it is supposedly more dangerous to be a work that we need masks, that the CDC has even said aren’t that effective, then why are we back in the office full time? We had a working solution that was the work from home schedule, I do not understand the risk to employees that is said to be severe enough to wear masks yet is worth the risk to still be present in person?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long link, but there are these masks that if you must comply at least allow for airflow and you can breathe.  I'm considering buying this for my workplace as well. As one of the reviewers said, if anyone comes close enough to see that it's full of holes then they obviously aren't practicing social distancing. The reviews are nice to read and give a sliver of hope.</p>

<p>It's called science, cupcake. It continues to evolve as we learn more. Just wear the mask, get vaxxed, and stop being a snowflake.</p>
