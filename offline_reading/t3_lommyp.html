    <strong>My observations on a potential return to normal. A subtle experience I had today.</strong>
    <p><p>To start with a small example (This is a weird one bear with me)</p>
<p>I had a terrible haircut and wore a hat for 2 months to grow it back in. It was a buzzcut that was NOT my look. When my hair finally grew back in and I stopped wearing a hat - I felt exposed. It was weird not having warn some type of beanie / cap for the first time in ages. Such a small and subtle difference in my life that made me reassess how tiny something like that can get you adjusted to your own new normal. It was funny in a sense because now I'm like "Oh shit, is my hair sticking up? I haven't had to worry about that in some time".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That's the micro. Imagine the macro.</p>
<p>No more social distancing. No more masks. No more signs on the store windows and floors. No more ugly stickers on the floor telling you to KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. No more faceless people and destruction of the social environment. No more acceptable shame or guilt for having seen friends / family....</p>
<p>How will people do it? I honestly don't think some will be able to unless there was a mass media campaign for the encouragement of normal life. That WILL NOT HAPPEN unless they mention the vaccine which will only exacerbate peoples fear. Yes, they'll return to normal but never without getting a vaccine. Really nothing will change. Anti-maskers will just be switched to anti-vaxxers and so on.</p>
<p>Maybe my OCD is too far gone to register in normality, but even going a few days without shaving makes me forget what I look like clean shaven, haha - that's why I used the haircut example... now imagine in on a mass societal scale with people that actually believe the shit that's going on...</p>
<p>If I visited a state that had zero restrictions there'd almost be a guilt complex. "Is this okay? I can't believe I'm living in the real world again". But how could someone who's followed and this narrative and made it their religion EVER possibly assimilate to the real world again?  </p>
<p>Just the examples I've seen are... How can you even put it? People outdoors with masks on only to take them off to smoke. People morbidly overweight shouting about social distancing so they can retain their ideal health. You need a mask to stand alone and pick up your food but one is not needed when you're sitting with others eating and speaking..... The same covidian religious doctrine they follow cannot be easy to reverse. </p></p>
