    <strong>Genuine question (not trying to troll) from a "doomer"</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all, a "doomer" here. I'm not here to troll nor argue -- I like reading others' viewpoints on things to expand my world view, even if I don't agree with them. </p>
<p>I can grasp the personal liberty argument that many here hold, but what I don't understand is the viewpoint that masks will suffocate/kill you, or cause other serious harm due to infections, etc. </p>
<p>Dentists, doctors, and many other professions have been wearing masks for decades with no harm. Many are required to wear a mask for hours on end. The same could be said for winter sports athletes and balaclavas/face coverings for the cold. </p>
<p>So the question is: what is the reasoning behind this viewpoint? I'd be happy to read any research or literature you've come across that backs your point.</p></p>

        <p>Because it's a lie that doctors an dentists have to wear them for hours and hours. In a sterile environment such as an OR? Sure.</p>
<p>In real life? Reusing the same one over and over and over? That's not sterile. That's a breeding ground for germs.</p>
<p>There is also no proof, whatsoever, of efficacy at preventing the spread of disease. Not to mention the reasoning behind it - asymptomatic spread - has been thoroughly debunked since April, but we are all walking disease vectors who will kill everyone? They also do not work: look at California.</p>
<p>If you want to wear one, sure. But it is a symptom of a greater problem: the utter hysteria and removal of civil rights around the world because of our over-reaction to this virus. Mandates for anything are shitty.</p>

        <p>Not going to touch the efficiency of them, again not here to argue - but as for the using same ones over and over (w/o washing them), I haven't heard anyone suggest doing that. Either use the disposable ones or have a rotation of cloth masks that you wash regularly. That's why I don't understand the suffocation/germs argument.</p>

        <p>A friend of mine just came back from a vacation abroad. Told me how he'd hang with friends at a local pub, outdoors, where masks weren't required. Any time anyone would want to visit the toilet, they would have to go indoors, where masks were obligatory. So, they just borrowed <em>the only available mask at the pub</em>, and then left it back for the next person. Yeah...</p>

        <p>Of course no one suggests doing that, because it’s incredibly unhealthy. </p>
<p>What experts suggest and what people actually do are very different things. </p>
<p>If you wear masks, you should wear surgical masks (there is compelling evidence against cloth masks, the World Health Organization will tell you about it if you’re interested), and you should change them very frequently - and as soon as they get wet, for example from sweat. </p>
<p>I know several people who religiously wear masks in public. Their behaviors include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>rotating between 2-3 cloth masks, each of which is worn for a full day, and washing only once a week </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wearing a single cloth mask for consecutive days before washing it </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reusing surgical masks (sometimes longer term: I know several who will use the same mask for a week+) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>heavily sweating in a mask without replacing it (see: the effect of moisture of effectiveness, air flow, and bacteria growth) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations for a population at large must be based on <em>actual behavior</em>, not on ideal behavior. </p>
<p>Even assuming efficacy, proper mask usage requires a standard of hygiene that is ludicrous to expect of the typical person on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> this problem of cloth masks and reusing masks will be more severe for poor people - people who are tight on food money are very likely to heavily reuse all types of masks without washing them. </p>
<p>Also, just to be clear: wearing a single mask for a full day is also poor hygiene; they should be replaced more frequently than that.</p>

        <p>My dentist literally told me the other day he thinks this whole thing is bullshit. He used that word.</p>
<p>He said in 25 years of practicing dentistry, he never wore a mask and he never once caught an illness from a patient. The only times he was sick was when his kids brought home stuff, probably from school. </p>
<p>He said “I’m too good at math and statistics to be duped into thinking masks do anything.”</p>
<p>It was actually a great boost to my mood to hear someone objectively smarter than me and in healthcare reaffirm my beliefs.</p>

        <p>Why do I have to wear a government approved uniform to leave my house? That’s the root of all of this. </p>
<p>What if the government made me wear a certain color shirt/hat/shoes/etc whenever I left the house? Is that acceptable? How can we exist in a free society when we have to wear government approved uniforms that de-personalize us in order to participate? </p>
<p>“There’s a pandemic; we need masks as a visual reminder” (this is a real statement from British Columbia). </p>
<p>“This is an election year, we need everyone to wear purple mismatched shoes and will ban them from society if they don’t. It’s a visual reminder of the election”. </p>
<p>Or even better: “this is an election year, we are requiring everyone to wear red MAGA hats in order to participate in society because we’re the party in charge and we say so”. </p>

        <p>You can’t do anything that you need to do to take care of yourself without one. That’s not okay. I don’t believe they’re intended to be temporary. It sets a bad precedent for other mandated things. I don’t like the way disabled people are being attacked for not being able to wear one. The other issues in the world didn’t disappear just because the news only talks about the virus.</p>

        <p>As someone who worked in the dental field for decades, who was a clinical manager and teacher who was responsible for health safety compliance :</p>
<p>1.) We only wore masks in operatories for the duration of the actual procedure. Only then. They were promptly tossed after the procedure was done. 
2.) Per regulation, a mask worn longer than an hour had to be discarded and replaced with a new one.  Droplet moisture buildup renders the mask ineffective. I would fire an employee attempting to reuse a mask. 
3.) The only masks that fully protect the user and patient are valveless N-95 that have been properly fit tested. (Most dentists never bought these because they cost more anyway.)
4.) Rectangular disposable surgical masks do not protect the user from droplet carried disease.  I’ve know that for decades, it even says this on the box it came in. And if you want to argue with me, I can send you a photo of a pre-Covid purchased box of masks.</p>
<p>Edit: My stance: I am not 100% against mask usage in the general population going forward. I think in certain situations people should be wearing them more.(Such those who are sick or immunocompromised, or if simply the person chooses to wear one for their own safety.) What I am against is the extinction of personal choice. Sadly, just existing is risky, you have been exposed to so many viruses and situations in your life that could have hurt or killed you before. Nothing has changed, and the overwhelming evidence suggests that the virus is nowhere near as deadly as we thought.</p>

        <p>I think it really boils down to how people view masks. If you believe a surgical, cloth, etc. mask protects you from Covid, wearing it must help you breathe easy. But if you don't think they work, and being forced to wear one makes you feel like an insane person, you might have trouble breathing through it. Mandates force us to wear masks, but they can't ensure we wear them correctly or in a way that doesn't harm our health (i.e. wearing dirty masks). People like myself who worry about infection are just realistic that we won't always be able to keep them clean, and are likely frustrated that the powers that be don't seem to care.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I don't think they're that bad tbh you're right. However, I don't the like idea of people being forced to wear them in public, like it should be a choice. And some people do have legit health issues that prevents them from wearing one. But in general you're right</p>

        <p>To give you an idea of what kind of people post here let me tell you about myself so you can decide if everyone who posts here is crazy or not.  I was never a "doomer" but I am a believer.  I do think this is worse than the flu and my own non-scientific anecdotal data says we have an abnormal number of deaths (I know second-hand 3 people who have died form the virus, never had that happen during a flu season).  I do believe in vaccines but am a little concerned with timing on the current candidates (though the m-RNA vaccines scare me a bit less due to their mechanism).  I don't think the earth is flat, I do believe the holocaust happened and I even believe WW1 happened too (that's a reference to a post made earlier today).  I am very science-oriented but I also believe its a good idea to ask questions whenever anyone on Fox or CNN tells you something as fact.  I wear a mask when I'm asked because even though I hate it, its not a big deal to me, not big enough to argue over anyway...for now.</p>
<p>My biggest concern right now is that since the precedent has been set mask mandates may be invoked for flu season, etc...  We have already had at least one politician suggest it.  We have lived for thousands of years without masks and now we have a whole population begging to be made to wear one.</p>
<p>My other issues are with the general disruption to everyday life, which, if truly temporary is fine.  I have a feeling we are going to have a segment of the population which will NEVER feel safe and continue to push this crap for years.  Already the goalposts have been moved and nobody is ever satisfied.  First it was prevent deaths, then it was prevent hospitalizations, and when those two metrics were in check it suddenly became prevent cases.  To make matters worse, at some point everyone stopped being concerned about the rate (cases/day) and now the big thing is to report on the cumulative total.  It's pure manipulation by the media because it keeps eyeballs glued to the screen and people who don't understand how large numbers work are scared to death, which I don't blame them for.</p>
<p>Most people agree that this thing is REALLY easy to catch.  So easy that its virtually impossible to keep the majority of people from getting it.  When someone says "xxx people have died, this is a tragedy" they're not wrong, it is a tragedy.  But I also highly doubt you were going to have a significantly different outcome otherwise.  You were likely going to lose them at some point anyway, just further down the line.  Dr. Fauci and the other experts agreed with this as the original strategy was "flatten the curve", meaning stop everyone from getting it at the same time so hospitals don't get overwhelmed.  The strategy was always to space out the hospitalizations because a total stoppage of cases was never realistic.  But here we are, goalposts moved to an impossible metric, stop all cases.</p>
<p>The science is the other problem, or lack thereof, or conflicting data...so many problems.  A major issue has been with pre-print papers being available to the general public and being taken as gospel.  Back when r/Coronavirus was still r/China_Flu I was a frequent poster there as it was fascinating and I was very concerned and did my best to help interpret numbers and try to figure out what was going on.  As someone who reads and interprets data, I'm familiar with a published paper.  I tried explaining to people what a pre-print is and nobody seemed to care and the problem has only become worse.  People who keep saying they believe in science are doing it completely wrong!</p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of text, I'm in a hurry but I wanted to give you the best answer I could.  Please disregard spelling/grammar if I made mistakes.  That's all I can think of off the top of my head.  If there's anything else you want to know just ask.</p>
<p>Edit: OP, I forgot to put this in my post but I wanted to thank you for being open to asking questions and listening.  You're doing it right.</p>

        <p>Because the religious fervor around masks is goofy and defeats the purpose.  Masks could help on things like mass transit, but the cult of the mask has gone way overboard on this.  For instance, I keep hearing complaints about people not wearing masks in Illinois - masks have been required inside for months by Governor Porky the Corrupt, so the complaints about not wearing masks are about outside.  It's ridiculous to wear them outside, especially when involved in strenuous exercise.  The scenario of a person catching Covid from briefly passing someone running outside is non-existent.  But that is where we are...  It's security theater catering to the neurouses of upper-middle-class White People, people who I thought were noxious liberal moral scolds prior to this whole situation.  I really don't care about the unhinged paranoias of center-left millennial mommies and am tired of dropping everything to cater to their feelings.</p>

        <p>Masks are the least of my concerns in all this. I don’t necessarily think they work as well as touted but if people will accept more normalcy with masks as a placebo, it’s whatever. I’ll take it. I just don’t agree with the somewhat religious fervor behind wearing them. It shouldn’t be such a big forced ideal. Require them in stores, fine but it’s this whole huge deal online and I think the repeated glorification of them will actually make more people wary of them.</p>

        <p>Oh boy, I've been waiting for someone to ask this.</p>
<p>What drove me towards skepticism in general and anti-mask extremism in general is that, quite frankly, I don't think the masks are, in and of themselves, all there is to it.  I think there's something worse coming down the pipeline, which the masks are being used as a psychological preparation for.  My money is on a rushed, highly experimental vaccine, possibly with legitimate DNA-altering properties, a high adverse-reaction rate, or some other very good reason not to get it willingly, which "the powers that be" will try to force on us as the price of a return to normality.  This could look like a straight-up mandate (plenty of noise about that already), no-jab/no-job type regulations, or just using the power of the Omnipresent Megacorporation to pull a yesn't the way they already have with masks and speech/censorship; in the end, it doesn't really matter much.</p>
<p>Now, I have a baseline belief that forcing vaccine acceptance by any of those methods is immoral on the face of it.  It doesn't matter the reason, it doesn't matter the sickness, it doesn't matter if the vaccine can be proven to be 100% effective with a 0% rate of adverse reactions, the needle should never be stuck in under duress.  And it doesn't matter how long you cancel my life or force me to wear a face diaper, I'm always going to believe this.  I could "go along to get along" on masks for years without ever changing this baseline belief.</p>
<p>The problem is, there are a lot of people who, while not necessarily a part of "the powers that be" themselves, don't have this baseline belief, and see mandatory vaccination as a valid strategy for achieving public-health objectives.  Some of these people hold threatening positions in the bureaucracy, and some of them just sit around on Reddit making noise.</p>
<p>When the vaccine is finished and ready, "the powers that be" want those people to still be thinking "PANDEMIC" so they'll see forced vaccinations as a necessary step to end said pandemic, and they want the rest of us to be so sick of the dumpster fire 2020 has become that we'd give our immortal souls just to be allowed to forget it ever happened.  They can't let us forget about the virus before that point, because then they'll lose their opportunity to profiteer and (perhaps more importantly) advance agendas.</p>
<p>That's why said TPTB are so insistent that everyone wear masks until judgment day and trumpets sound - they're a reminder that keeps everyone constantly immersed in fear, uncertainty, and doubt even if they deliberately disconnect from the mainstream news cycle to avoid it, so that there will be less fuss when it's time to unleash the next phase of authoritarian collectivism.</p>
<p>If I really believed that it was "just a mask" and really was about saving lives, I'd say go ahead and wear one if you think it will help anything.  As it is, though, the more mandatory something is, the less I trust it.</p>
<p>I know you probably think I'm some kind of crazy conspiracy nut for thinking this, but to me this crisis looks like 9/11 pumped full of growth hormones and steroids, and I don't want the response to this virus to last anywhere near as long as the response to 9/11 <em>is still lasting</em>.</p>

        <p>Here is a Study by the Swiss on the fact that mask meta data was skewed at the very least and completely misrepresented by the mask proponents. Sweden is a living example of what happens when you don't have the "doomer" mindset, low infection rates, majority of businesses saved, overall populations mental health is much better than pro lockdown countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/">https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/</a></p>
<p>Suicides have eclipsed COVID deaths. CDC's own statistics say you have a 1 and 19.1 million chance of catching and dying of COVID 19 if you're 50 to 65 years old and are far lower for those younger. These are a couple of reasons why I don't buy into the "hype" on the "dangers" of getting infection.</p>

        <p>I think you are focusing on the wrong part of mask opposition. Very few people are against masks because they think they will kill them (I've never seen that, but you can find people that believe just about anything). The negative health side effects (reduced oxygen, bacterial collection, anxiety, etc) are almost always low on the list of reasons why people oppose masks. These points are usually only brought up when pro maskers claim that there are no downsides to wearing masks. Most of the opposition to masks is more about being against the government forcing people to wear a mask when the underlying science behind it is so incredibly thin. There are just as many studies showing that masks are not effective as there studies claiming that they work. And at this point we have months of real world, in practice, data from all around the world where mask mandates have actually been enacted. And the data is very clear that mask wearing has little to no impact on the spread of this disease. Look at California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Virginia, Maryland, Hawaii, Spain, Belgium, France, Peru, The Philippines, Argentina, and countless other places. The idea that masks slow the spread if Sar-Cov-2 is not supported by the data. So it is very troubling when governments mandate policy that is based on incredibly weak scientific studies and not supported by the actual data. That is why people are against masks. The fact that there are negative health ramifications to wearing masks is just another bullet point that makes the case against mask mandates more robust.</p>

        <p>Here is another viewpoint from the anti-maskers.  In the county of NYS where I reside - there have been zero resident deaths to date.  Lets grasp that no one has died.  zero.  There were 2 non-resident deaths which were cases that patients from NYC were sent to die (maybe to make sure we had some deaths here to keep the fear up).</p>
<p>So while the mask is the symbol of "Mutual respect" of doomers, to others, with viewpoints grounded in data, it's just  a symbol of how ridiculous the government response has been - the governer of NYS destroyed the economy which will definitely cause much suffering, closed down essential services like schools etc, all based on his own declaration of emergency, in a county where not one resident has died.  So on top of destroying the fabric of society, the dictator now requires the subjects to wear a mask (in a county with no deaths), in a sign of irony/submission.</p>
