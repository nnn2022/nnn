        <p>I'm recovering from EMHS (electromagnetic hyper sensitivity) and yes what she experiencing is just that. If it came out of nowhere like and it's almost a constant then someone probably installed more wireless radiation around her and her body couldn't handle it. Mark my words when 5G becomes the norm we're going to start seeing clusters of people with these sorts of issues all at once and the media is going to be told to blame it on something else. Knew it was gonna happen but didn't know they would use a hyper up cold virus to do it.</p>

        <p>Mark my words, your symptoms are not related to 5G and there is no such thing as EMHS in the real world.</p>
<p>Too many studies done debunking it... it just doesn't exist. You are more likely to be having problems due to imbalances of chemical in your brain related to not getting enough of X vitamin or Y mineral.</p>

        <p>It's real and if I was exposed for too long I could have had a seizure or a stroke to certain kinds. Different devices tended to do different flavors of the same thing that would eventually end at the point for me. I had repeated observable problems when exposed to different kind of radiation from electronics. Wifi would dysregulate my whole body and give me severe confusion. Screen radiation up front would give me burning like sensations on my face and lead to intense brain fog if  exposure was long enough. Radiation from say a processor in a computer/console would give me the most flu like issues and interact with my sinuses the most (which by the ends of exposures to all of these would often be mostly closed up to the point where I almost couldn't breathe through it). I was not largely deficient in anything, I have a diverse diet and take B12 and D3 on top of it.</p>
<p>I survived on a combinations of food grade sodium bentonite clay, artemisinin, Cistus Incanus and cloves tea, Propolis, and black walnut. The condition will never be recognized because it would open such a huge can of worms and everyone would know what this radiation we are steeped in every day has the potential to do. But whatever just ignore the canary in the coalmine as more and more stories like what you read here keep popping up.</p>
