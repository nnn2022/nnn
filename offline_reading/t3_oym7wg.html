        <p>Reminds me of this Gambino Swine Flu 1976 story.</p>
<p>Dr. Archie Kalokerinos states:</p>
<p><strong>”President Ford was about to vaccinate the entire population of America, every man, woman and child, black, white and brindle against swine flu, because some idiot had told him there was going to be a massive epidemic</strong> that was going to kill millions of people. And my views received considerable publicity. In fact <strong>I ended up appearing on Catty Cosby’s television program</strong>, and I said it would be mass murder and <strong>I specifically described how people who had heart problems could drop dead. There was a man watching the programme in New York who did not like a particular gentleman by the name of Gambino. Gambino was 69 years old and a mafia boss. He thought this is a great idea. So he got someone to persuade Gambino to have his flu shot and Gambino promptly dropped dead. The heading of the newspapers went something like "Mafia flu jab conspiracy". It was fairly obvious that the person who advised Gambino knew what would happen or was hoping that Gambino would drop dead. It caused a hell of a row.</strong> </p>
<p>But <strong>President Ford</strong> said "I’ll settle all this", and he called a special news conference and in front of the whole of America <strong>rolled up his sleeve and had his shot.</strong> Now there is no doubt <strong>he did not have swine flu vaccine. They would not have given it to him, no way!”</strong></p>
