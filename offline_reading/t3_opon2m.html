    <strong>Feeling isolated at work</strong>
    <p><p>Everything was fine last week.  No discussions about COVID, the vaccine, everyone was normal and was just talking about regular shit.</p>
<p>One person got sick today and called off.  Tested negative for COVID.  I share an office with them, not at the same time, and everyone has treated me like I'm in solitary confinement and don't want to be near me just because I'm sitting in the same office as someone who was sick.</p>
<p>I've barely spoke to anyone today.  I went to stand where everyone was talking and a couple people stepped back, saw my confused reaction, and said they couldn't risk their grandparents getting sick because of the office that I sit in.</p>
<p>Before this I felt great.  We were all just people having fun while making good money at the same time. Now the vaccine talks are starting about who is or isn't vaccinated.</p>
<p>I feel alone in a place where I could laugh and joke with my friends. They aren't bad people, they're just victims of the current propaganda machine.</p>
<p>I have no one here to talk to about this so I figured I'd rant here.  This is the worst day I've had in months and it's upsetting to see that I'm being treated differently because someone I share an office with has a sore throat and a cough.</p></p>

        <p>Ya I hear ya, I've noticed the switch in people who were starting to come around. My good buddy was all against it and once the fear porn came on with the variants he got vaxxed. I couldn't believe it! I'm like what happened? He just regurgitated the media talk points and was compeled to do it.</p>
<p>It's sad to see the overwhelming effect it has on people but stay strong. U have RIGHT on ur side and no coercion from any angle can change that.</p>

        <p>It's really upsetting, I can somewhat understand their fear if I was coughing all over the place.  I'm extremely healthy and have had no recent medical issues.</p>
<p>The biggest part of this whole mess is the myth of "asymptomatic" spread, and that you can't be around someone like me who isn't even sick.</p>

        <p>It's definately the normal for cults (isolation from friends and family, pushed fear of boogeymen they make up and demand trust in, masks to dehumanize &amp; breakdown identity so they can remake it, drugs to disable/make dependent, etc).   </p>
<p>But what do you mean by pandemic?   Do you mean that WHO corp's defined term "pandemic" that doesnt require any illness or a single death and the "declaration" of which simply activates sleeping contracts bw governments (municipal corporations) and pharmaceutical companies to buy (via theft from people who actually earn) X amount of drugs from them with no liability?  I'm genuninely curious what people mean when they say pandemic.  I have a hunch most people would define "pandemic" as some netflix/outbreak preprogramming movie and have no idea what the term being used by tv/gov actors actually means, which has no relation. </p>
<p>OP, that's so weird and sad people are that far gone. 
After informing family of the fraud via their own data and words awhile back, I havent given any attention to the scam, so I havent heard of "delta variant" but sounds like the soap opera has been marching on right in line with the lockstep script.   Im sorry you have to deal with this nonsense.  Here are a couple ideas for such situations:
- sarcasm that kinda jolts them into realizing how crazy theyre being.  Like "wait till the tv rolls out the <em>omega variant</em>...heard it's supposed to be nuts, like 10X the hype of their previous boogeymen.  Def dont want to get burnt out on concern till then, youre gonna want full reserves for that".  Bad version example but u get the idea.
- hard truth, eg "bob/susie, are you ok? that's a really serious claim youre making that i would somehow kill your grandma which no one should be throwing around as it's unlawful.  Going fwd, pls refrain from making such claims without evidence to support it that you would testify to under penalty of perjury.<br>
- ignore entirely and focus on yourself and doing well at work/life.  If these people believe this junk at any stage, much less this stage, I'd imagine youre not missing out on much not socializing with them (youre probably better off not getting dragged down into hive mind topics and low frequency level, which is not good for mental or physical health).  You could try to find a group of like minded people in ither offices to go to lunch with, or skip lunch and bounce early everyday, or use your lunch break to train for a marathon or something (will be hard for your coworkers to square their tv beliefs with that), or use it to take online classes in something useful youre interested in (ham radio, emt training, common law are some good ones).  As time passes, theyll have wasted away their time worrying over fiction while youll have done what makes you happy and improved your life with new friends and or skills.  </p>
<p>There are a bunch of ways, try things out/find what works for you but build another way as i dont think those on the cult path are coming out of it snytime soon, and most importantly, dont let them get you down.</p>

        <p>I got tested once because of a close contact, my employer at the time required it, I wasn't sick, and got off work for 2 days paid.</p>
<p>If everyone trusts their shot so much, why be fearful of someone who had a cough and tested negative? it makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

        <p>This is my biggest fear at work right now.  Something stupid like this happening at my workplace than bam! Forced masking and vaccine bullying. I really hope that this won't happen as I really enjoy finally being mask-free and not having work force vaccines/masks down my throat.</p>

        <p>I'm not wearing a mask ever again or taking the vaccine. I had noticeably worse breathing issues when I was required to wear a mask at my previous employer.  I have a heart problem caused by a medication made by one of the vaccine manufacturers, and risking that getting worse will never be in my best interest.</p>
