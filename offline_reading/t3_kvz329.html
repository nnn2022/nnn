    <strong>I can't do it</strong>
    <p><p>I can't fucking do this anymore. Netherlands just extended the lockdowns and are thinking about a curfew. </p>
<p>What the fuck is going on? What is wrong with people? I watched the prime minister live as he was telling the country about the extended lockdown. And oh my god the comments. Everyone was jerking off, jizzing their pants about the extended lockdown. There were people talking about how we should be able to criminally charge the antimaskers, jail them, how they should listen to germany and possibly extend the lockdown until april, or better yet, summer!!</p>
<p>I can't do this shit anymore. I live in fucking clown world. Has everyone gone fucking mental or am I caught in a nightmare which I can't wake up from.</p>
<p>There is no pandemic, there is no killer virus, there is a virus, a new virus, not even that deadly, what the fuck is going on, how is everyone losing their shit? How are people still buying into this? 
How can they not see that there is no reason to fucking panic.</p>
<p>How do you guys cope? Seriously, I need some advice.
I take my daughter and dog and go out for 1 hour walks every day. We play games, we go to the woods, we went out to buy some pie today to treat ourself for no fucking reason. But it's not enough. I can't do this shit anymore.</p>
<p>It's not the lockdown, it's the insanity I live in. I don't care about the lockdown, I still visit my family and basically do the same shit as I did before. It's looking around me and seeing complete insanity. How do you guys cope?</p></p>

        <p>Its the same for me. Its the insanity around me that is really tipping me over, not the rules and restrictions themselves. 
Although the rules and stuff are insane, the idea that what I see being so different to others close to me is not only very weird, but very lonely.</p>
<p>I dont think I am coping lol. Keep doing what youre doing and keep reaching out to those who do understand.</p>

        <p>You're not. Our lockdown is extended until the beginning of February.  I prefer not to think about what will happen later next.... I only wish we could return to the normal in March :( :( <br>
All around the globe we're suffering, and so few people are actually heard. All the attention is directed towards covid maniacs and the mask lovin'. Where I live everyone is becoming a zombie. People are not smiling anymore on the streets.</p>

        <p>Yep, we just had a "stay at home order" as our Provincial Gov just stole more power by declaring another state of emergency. So we in Ontario, Canada will be charged if we leave our house for non-essential reasons. No clarification on what's essential - like walks? Can we walk? No idea. It is all so fucking insane.</p>

        <p>I still refuse to believe this is about conservative vs. liberal. I know the media wants us divided and that's how they do it. Align (or malign, I guess?) anyone who questions lockdowns with the conservative side and anyone who is virtuous and good little soldiers who wear their masks with the lovely liberals. Well I am a political orphan now.</p>

        <p>Same here. I'm from the Netherland so I'm neither liberal or conservative. We don't use those labels here. I am a 33 yr old woman, a mother, a nurse and someone who doesn't support the lockdown. That's it. </p>
<p>I hate that I get lumped up with the trump supporters or belong with the conservatives. Not because they are trump supporters or conservatives, because I want to be a human being, not part of a club. I don't care who you vote for. We're all against the new normal here, that's what the conversation should be about.</p>

        <p>I’ve been going to a therapist regularly for 20 years. Since the lockdown, I haven’t been able to have in person sessions, virtual ones are worthless or make me feel worse. I don’t blame him, I blame this bullshit paranoia. My mental health has only gotten worse and even with that happening, I’ve changed the frequency of our virtual sessions to once a month instead of every two weeks because of what a waste they’ve become.</p>

        <p>I try to do that a lot. Well the walking and leaving my phone at home. I always walk a lot but I do a lot more of it and without my phone. I loved listening to podcasts or music while I walked but over the last few months I don’t. It’s a good “escape.”</p>

        <p>R/im14andthisisdeep accidentally found this browsing all rising and Jesus this might be the most pathetic sub out here. Refusing to do the easiest god damn thing in the world and just wear a mask in public is not being a slave, it’s being a member of society and a decent human being. Unless anyone here can show me their past experience working as a virologist, you should just write your opinion on a piece of toilet paper and mail it to me so at least then it’d be somewhat useful. The internet really has made lots of people with low critical thinking skills a lot stupider now that everyone thinks they’re a genius because they fell deep into conspiracy crap online, I hope nobody has to lose a loved one in the future</p>

        <p>Exactly. Everything comes down to money. The sooner people would understand that the better. They can fly private btw. Even in normal times it's better fly private. Plus rich people don't go to touristy places anyway, so lockdowns aren't a problem for them.</p>

        <p>Ontario, the largest province in Canada is amplifying restrictions, starting Thuraday. Our cases have been decreasing, and we are getting further restrictions. We have 28xx ICU's with ventilators, 385 are occupied. We have 384 hospitals in Canada. They keep saying hospitals are near capacity. I know nurses that work in the "hardest" struck areas. They have said there hospitals has never had more than single digit covid patients in the hospital at any given time during this pandemic. All of this information is on the government website, they are outright lying to us, and people are wanting it.</p>

        <p>My partner has a degree in statistical analysis and recently took it upon himself to take all of the readily available Ontario government statistics and make his own charts.  (Mostly because he feels like he is going crazy watching everyone in Ontario getting a hard-on every time Doug Ford announces new restrictions).</p>
<p>He came to the conclusion that the ratio of positive tests to tests done daily is flattening out at about 4-6% (you can’t focus on the early data spikes).  Most telling is how flat the deaths/daily tests appears - it’s relatively flat at about 0.06% of positive tests resulting in death, well below earlier days in the pandemic.  According to the Ontario government website,  88.13% of the deaths are for people over the age of 70 (not bringing in comorbidity).  So looking at the data, governments and the media are reporting the data just based on total positive tests each day.  They do not account for the total number of tests carried out that day.  When you do that a different picture emerges.</p>

        <p>That's exactly what I am thinking all the time. Don't just talk about the positive tests, look at how many are tested totally.</p>

        <p>Try and lose myself in old tv shows and video games. Right now I’m rewatching true blood and playing parasite eve.</p>
<p>Post anti mask fliers around town and have plans to get the “inside outside wear a mask it’s the law” sign taken down that are posted along Main Street.</p>
<p>Never wear a mask unless I’m at work and trying to get a Kickstarter going when I can afford internet again so I don’t have to work a masked job anymore.</p>
<p>And other assorted hobbies. I do blacksmithing out in front of my house and no one asks me to mask. But is anyone going to bother a guy with a hammer and an orange hot metal bar?</p>

        <p>Thanks for the suggestions. I don't really like watching movies and series and Iwant to set a good exampke for my daughter, that life is about more than a screen and there is a whole world to discover outside.

        <p>You're not supposed to meet or date anyone. I think single people are one of the forgotten/unmentioned casualties in all this, left out even when other negative lockdown effects are listed. In many places, including where I live, it's illegal to go on a date, or have sex with someone you don't live with. It's insane. There's only so much chatting online a person can do. I would give ANYTHING for a big hug right now...</p>

        <p>Honestly. Til the day I die I will NEVER EVER understand how all this has happened. Not for one moment have I been scared of this virus. The hardest thing for me to grasp is how nearly everyone has fallen for the msm narrative without questioning it. I never saw myself as different from other people. I think I am fairly intelligent. Always been a person who questions stuff. But nothing has prepared me for this. I know that some of my friends now look at me like I am some nut job conspiracy theorist. I know it. It’s like no one is  allowed to question the lockdowns. The virus. It sickens me. It terrifies me. Almost any other topic is open for discussion but not covid. All I can think is it’s because people are scared. I read a really interesting take on all this today. Someone said folks like being locked down. No work. No commuting. Paid to stay home. Cushy. They don’t want the lockdown to end as it would mean a return to work etc. Back to a life of work and no vacation. More responsibility. It really resonated with me. I think they are on to something. People are getting comfortable doing nothing.</p>

        <p>Heh good point.. I hadn't considered that even though I've been (fortunately, very very fortunately) working from home this entire time and it's been great to be with my wife and spend time with my newborn. I don't want to go back to work but I absolutely want this whole ruse to end. </p>
<p>It's infuriating to see people have devolved into cowards capable of snitching on their neighbours for living their lives; cops hand out fines to people outside of their house after a certain, arbitrary time; and that science is not something to be debated as of 2020. </p>
<p>I haven't fallen for it and have been vocal about my stance since the beginning, but I do see the silver lining to the p(l)andemic in terms of affect on my life - just not enough for me to want it to persist indefinitely like these dolts begging to be lorded over.</p>

        <p>Relax. It's important not to drive yourself into a state where you feel like there's no way out, that you're trapped. That can lead to neurosis and depression. Nothing unusual is going on; at least, nothing unusual for human history.  You're just in the midst of a historical process. Namely, a deep crisis of a dying economic system and a revolutionary uprise. Under the pretext of the global "pandemic" the following goals are achieved by the largest capital (all of them are aimed at overcoming a massive economic crisis, at the heart of which lies the crisis of overproduction, in other words, what we are witnessing is Great Depression 2.0 covered up with a "deadly virus"):</p>
<p>- closing down plants, factories and even whole industries (i.e. slowing down the production process in order to let old products gradually dissolve and stop the production of new ones; dealing with not only oversupply of products, resulting from incorrect distribution, but also services)</p>
<p>- downsizing workforce (because many workers are simply not needed when there is an overproduction of goods)</p>
<p>- killing off small and medium businesses in order to replace them on the market (this always happens during an economic crisis, a small capitalist gets eaten by a big one)</p>
<p>- cutting expenses on healthcare and education (millions of operations have been cancelled, medical staff has been getting laid off; schools and universities are switching to remote learning with plans to replace teachers with video lectures)</p>
<p>- fighting and slowing down the inevitable revolutionary uprise (protests and strikes resulting from downsizing, loss of small and medium businesses, loss of democratic rights etc) by banning social gatherings, putting muzzles on people's faces and demoralizing them</p>
<p>- intensifying economic exploitation (cancelling bonuses and freezing salaries; making people work overtime under the pretext of "difficult times for us all"; not paying wages for several months etc)</p>
<p>- maximizing profits, making billions of dollars out of thin air by forcing millions of people to buy a product they don't need (surgical masks against a respiratory virus, sanitizers, gloves, electronic thermometers etc. The daily profit from masks alone is so gigantic that they are for sure to remain with us forever now, until people abolish them)</p>

        <p>Do whatever you can to find people you can spend time with.  Little is more important at this point than being social, being supportive and supported, being human, even moreso for your daughter than yourself.</p>
<p>edit: we have it easy here.  our kids are in daycare so they get to play every day, we have friends on our street that come over to play, for dinner, for drinks in the hot tub, etc.  as long as that is available i can last a while longer, although i've pretty much written off my extended family as too stupid to bother with right now.</p>

        <p>I never had a lot of people around. I'm an introvert and autistic on top of that. I don't mke friends easily. I literally have no friends. Nobody I spend time with. My husband is awake thank heavens but my family already have their appointments for the vaccine and they can't wait.</p>
<p>I have seasonal depression on top of it all. Normally we take a small break from winter and go to spain to soak up some sun. And we do some other fun activities like going to the indoor swimming pool, visit an amusement park, go shopping etc. But now there is nothing. My life is chores around the house and work atm. </p>

        <p>I did the same this summer.  I'm usually a quiet person who doesn't really do much.  I get enough socialization from my job.  But with all interaction over zoom, I needed something else.  I joined a couple of hiking groups and turned into a "yes man".  Day trip to a lake?  Sure!  Up a mountain to say you did it?  I'm in.  Two nights at a remote lake?  Let's go!  I took days off work on a whim and it was great.  But now I'm back at square one with the groups all hibernating over the winter.  Gotta find something else to fill the weekends.</p>

        <p>We had just moved north, and I assumed these stalwart northern folk would be out and unafraid of a chilly day or a foot of snow. We're actually a little disappointed in how many really have hunkered down for what has been a pretty mild season.</p>
<p>Maybe for the winter you need a boardgame or dnd group :)</p>
<p>For unrelated reasons I want to get together an among us group, but that still doesn't really scratch the social itch.</p>

        <p>Same here, really struggling. </p>
<p>We had a curfew &amp; stricter policies implemented as of Saturday which are supposed to last 4 weeks, which is going to be bullshit since anyone whose brain hasn't been completed rotted by MSM &amp; masks knows it'll be much longer.</p>
<p>I'm not coping. I have a breakdown every day. I'll start bawling my eyes out, being unable to breath as I hold my 18 month old son, wondering if the new world order will fuck his entire life over. I've had to pull my car over so that I could calm down enough to drive again because I'd start hyperventilating and sobbing out of the blue. </p>
<p>I don't listen to the news. I deleted my Facebook to avoid all the virtue signaling doomers and I've never had Twitter. I was able to exercise until this past Saturday, when they shut down the pools.</p>
<p>My SO isn't a complete crazy doomer but he's definitely not someone I can talk to since he believes there is a pandemic.</p>
<p>I used to be able to talk to my parents but they're old school, and have lived through the Soviet regime. While they were sympathetic at the beginning, they're now telling me to suck it up and that this, like all things, will pass. That every generation has to face it's own battle and this is ours. My mom says I'm getting depressing to listen to.</p>
<p>I'm due to give birth in 5 weeks, I don't want to be bringing another innocent life into this shit show. I want to end it, for me and my kids. I know that sounds horrible but I have moments where I don't see any other way to keep them safe.</p>
<p>I can't do it anymore.</p>

        <p>I feel this same way. My husband is also a believer, but not zealous about it. But he thinks I’m crazy because I am strictly anti lockdown and anti mask. My kids are 2 and 5, and I can see the damage being done real time. My son should be going to kindergarten next year, and the thought of virtual kindergarten is so nauseating and just...sad. The intrusive thoughts of him not getting to live these first crucial years at school is soul crushing. And my daughter, my sweet girl, puts masks on her dolls and is terrified of other people because for her, this has been HALF OF HER LIFE. It’s not about me. Or my mask. And I wear mine while I work shifts at the grocery store. It’s about my goddamn kids. This is supposed to be their fucked up life now? No! No damnit! It tears my heart into pieces and I can’t breathe. </p>
<p>We have nowhere to go and nothing to do. It’s too cold to play outside, and everything indoor is closed. I have no one to talk to because my husband drank the diet kool aid and my family is across the country. It’s a lonely nightmare.</p>

        <p>What's the weather like over there where you are? Is there snow? You could make snow angels, is it raining? Jump in the puddles, is it cold? Take a walk and when you come back warm yourself up with hot coco.</p>
<p>Is there really nothing to do out? Bake cookies with the kids or buy some cookies and let them put sprinkles on them. Do some crafts, protect your table and let them play with shaving foam (feels really good, very soft) get a pet, a bunny or a hamster, close the curtains, make some popcorn and make an at home cinema. </p>
<p>There is loads to do. It is so goddamn hard sometimes to come up with these or to kick yourself in the butt to do them but it is worth it. Life is also what we make it, especially for the kids.</p>
<p>If you need to vent, my dms are open. You got this love</p>

        <p>That's really rough. I'm so sorry. I feel like I shouldn't give you any advice because I'm not in your situation.  I can maybe relate a little. Years ago, I was pregnant and mostly left alone in a foreign country. What I did was just focus on what I could control. I focused on getting ready for the baby. I also did little things that I enjoyed, like cooking, crocheting, and reading. After the baby, I was completely alone in that country for 11 months. I focused on my baby, me, and my house. I didn't think about my husband being in the war or the fact that my friends and family were very far away. That was years ago, but I am now single and still live far from family and friends. I used to love taking my kid to do things he enjoyed on weekends and I enjoyed going out by myself or with new friends on weekends I didn't have him. All of that is gone now and I really had myself worked up for most of 2020. But I decided to go back into my little self happiness bubble for 2021. I focus on what I can control. This group helps a lot. It helps me remember there are other people like me who don't agree with any of what is going on. </p>
<p>I wish you the best. I hope you can find some inner peace. I'm also scared about what is coming next or when and if this will end. But I just can't dwell on that anymore. It was destroying me.</p>

<p>I have done this multiple times over the last few weeks. I totally can relate. I am so sorry. Please try to stay strong for those sweet babies. All we can do is hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Good always prevails over evil in the end. This is what I always tell myself.</p>

        <p>Remember that everything feels heavier during pregnancy. Don't use your beautiful children as a weakness, use them as a strength. Forget abput consumerism and think of ways to show them life is worth living. It's rhe little stuff. They don't need tv programs, no amusent park, they don't care about restaurants. Go back to basic and forget about the outside world for a while. Show them life is worth living. Send me a dm if you need someone to vent too.</p>

        <p>As other comments say, I'm not sure I'm really coping with the insanity bit, especially because with all the outward pressure, it feels like it's me who is losing it.  I just remind myself of the facts, I absorb myself with hobbies, I continue to see friends and family, I surround myself with only sane people and I hope to god I am wrong about what is coming next.  Once a week I get together with some people in my family for a board games day with dinner and lots of alcohol, and I look forward to that every week. </p>
<p>I'm in the UK and the approach here has I think been even worse than Netherlands, but maybe not quite as insane as France.  I'm really struggling to give a shit about my (extremely well paid) wfh job at the moment so I am going to try and throw myself into that as I've been kind of AWOL since December, basically only logging on to answer emails and do the bare minimum.  I'm meant to be hiring someone new into my team and am wondering how I will be able to conduct interviews in this environment and with my current mental state, I've managed to delegate some of it to another person but man, some days I just don't want to get out of bed at all let alone pretend to be interested in my corporate job.  I guess, just know you're not alone and there are other people out there who feel exactly the same.</p>

        <p>Imagine all that plus losing 95% of your income and your health insurance so people SITTING AT HOME CAN “FEEL SAFE”.</p>
<p>My primitive survival brain has kicked in. I’m supposed to spend all my savings and go into debt just to survive? Fuck these complacent work from home people. </p>
<p>How are you gonna feel when the people YOU haven’t allowed to work for 10 months, so you could feel safe, come knocking on your door? Maybe they should just knock that door in and help themselves to what’s in your fridge?</p>
<p>The government isn’t helping people. Doesn’t matter which party. Both want control, and the work from homes are happy to give EVERYONE ELSES LIVELIHOOD AWAY.</p>

        <p>I am in Switzerland, the gyms are closed and you can't even exercise outside.</p>
<p>I dared breaking into a closed empty park to do a few pullups with a friend and, 15 minutes later, I see a police car circling the park. The two cops inside saw us, but we were able to outrun them easily.</p>
<p>When I got home I checked the official website of my state and it said that I would have been fined up to 600$. </p>

        <p>I honestly wasn’t coping well, extremely depressed, emotional, anxious, unable to focus or work. But I went and rented a place in FL for a year. Without that light in the end of my tunnel I would be still in my non-coping situation. I’m leaving in less than two weeks. Being able to plan for the future is very soothing. Feeling like I might actually have a future is priceless.</p>

        <p>How do I cope? Not very well. My mind basically stop associating with the place I grew up in and disconnects itself from the world around me. So, everything feel real and not real at the same time, and I feel like I'm in a foreign country. I don't feel like I'm in the same country with the same locals I grew up with. I've been lucky avoiding depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and not experienced it since it started - unlike many on this sub.</p>

        <p>Go find likeminded people and meet in person!</p>
<p>In my city we come together at the town square every monday before curfew (5 to 10 people).</p>
<p>We go for a walk, in pairs because you are only allowed to meet one other person apart from your houshold. Some carry candles, others hand out leaflets and we talk to the passers-by. Every now and then we join the protests in the next bigger city.</p>
<p>You can organize this easily over social media and you get in contact with all walks of life. I got to know some people I would never have talked to, we had a great times together, I even had sort of a date.</p>
<p>You are not alone! Make that visible for yourself. When the government tells you to socially distance, do the exact opposite!</p>

        <p>Hey friend. I'm lucky enough to be on a farm, two islands away from the nearest mainland, so obviously it's a lot easier for me. That being said, when the idiocy of the world reaches my doorstep, and it never fails to, I find the best way to cope is to simply not give credence to it. </p>
<p>Keep reading, keep educating yourself and take solace in the fact that your mind is not a prison like theirs. 
 It's still important to take time for yourself and take care for your own being, wether we are in a fascist takeover or not. "They" want demoralized, soul sucked people. Don't give it to them. Meditate, engage in a creative/fruits of your labor type activity and most importantly KEEP the conversations going.</p>

        <p>I feel you. </p>
<p>The most tangible and palpable effect this has had on me is creating distrust in people. With so many hoards of the masses just obediently doing what they are told, believing the fear hype, and willingly being controlled by the media. Complacently submitting. </p>
<p>Such manipulable and gullible people are our neighbors, our peers, our human family. I had more faith in people for their ability to be critical, free-thinking, and skeptical of governmental social controls. The false pretense of care has never manifested before, and the record of their oversight is one of neglect and abuse: the regular subjugation of minorities, of gay people, of the female vote, of drug users, the warmongering abroad, the lack of adequate support for those who are struggling financially, over-taxation, corporate lobbyists, abuse of prisoners of war, detainment and deportation of immigrants, property and asset seizures, prolific surveillance, raids on medical marijuana clinics, the list is endless... </p>
<p>Suddenly they declare masks are obligatory and mandate lockdowns due to a trivial and over-exaggerated illness, and everyone clamors to obey like herds of sheep? </p>
<p>It's just fucking sad. If such widespread behavior is the nature of my brothers and sisters I'd rather die than live like this.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I'm right there with you. Unfortunately I don't have any answers because we're in the middle of a collective mindfuck and a brazen attempt at restructuring of society. There's no rationality or peace anywhere to be found. My family is all from the Netherlands, I'm first generation born in the states. I can't believe either country is going for this shit, yet here we are. I'm half Native American, and almost every tribe has bought into this as well, when they're the one people who could just say no to closures. IDK, it's insane and I feel like I'm losing my will. There's no escape, I am an outdoors person, but I can only go on so many runs, hikes, drives, and bike rides. After 5pm I'm a prisoner I feel like.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I'm not positive that that's what Camus meant, but what it seems like to me is: your mind and soul is capable of existing in freedom even in a physically unfree environment. </p>
<p>I get that it's hard to reconcile inward and outward freedom, but not letting your spirit be crushed by outside circumstances is so important. I do understand, (and I agree that it's a stuggle) but stay strong. For yourself, and your precious daughter. Sending you hugs from America.</p>

        <p>This may or may not help, since admittedly I've been feeling similar over the past few months. But something that personally keeps me going in this weird sort of feeling of needing to know how this all ends. Like life is a story, and the story is getting real weird and has pretty much jumped the shark, but you gotta see how it plays out.</p>
<p>I don't think we're at the end of the story, it's gotta end somehow. I just don't know when it'll end, and that's the frustrating part. Months or years? I can take months, but maybe not years.</p>

        <p>In the beginning I really thought that our government was just trying their best to protect people, even though I didn't agree with their ways. I thought they just made the best decisions out of all the bad ones just to protect us. This was a new virus and we had no idea what was coming our way. Yes it sucked, but a pandemic just sucks, not the fault of the government.</p>
<p>Ofcourse now, after almost a year, we know exactly what we are dealing with. How people are still not seeing it...? No idea! Maybe they only follow MSM, it's straight up propaganda.</p>

        <p>I feel like I’m on the outside looking in...the way they demonize us and hate us with so much intensity...the way everyone seems to think and believe the same things...it has me questioning myself. To be accepted we have to submit to the “new normal”. Things are so wrong and I can’t make them right and it’s making me so angry and on edge. Their logic makes no sense, they all say and believe the same things, and everywhere I go nobody has an expression, it’s just eyes looking at me and I can’t read them. It’s enough to make someone suicidal.</p>

        <p>It someimes helps to see them as victims. Like children born into a hateful family, a family that's part of a gang or maybe KKK members, those children can't really help it. They are born into it and ofcourse they'll follow their parents beliefs. It takes a strong person to break free from that kind of indoctrination. </p>
<p>Try to see the pro maskers and pro lockdowners the same way. Victims of an abuse situation. They are being indoctrinated by government propoganda and unfortunately they still look at daddy government with heart shaped eyes, as if it only wants the best for them.</p>

<p>i'm from the us (worse, i live in a blue state), every damn day i have to battle some idiotic mask karen telling me to wear a mask. every day i walk into a store just getting my grocery expecting to be confronted by some absolute braindead sheep about mask. every day i use the same to-go line "if mask works you're protected why do you care for me?" and i have yet to see one soul come to sense of it.</p>
<p>im an immigrant from a communist country before i came to the us as a teen. i expect so much from the populace of the western hemisphere. we are supposed to be free/independent thinker, freedom lover, intelligent. yet one after the other, the majority of the "western world" countries behave more and more like authoritarian regime AND the majority of citizens, those smart/free thinker/indepedent westerners i thought so fondly of during my time growing up in communist birth country, not only blindly follow the flip-flopping pseudo science of lockdown/mask mandate, they cheer for those authoritarian measures and <em>demand</em> more.</p>
<p>small biz is crushed. a lot of industries are gone. future biz aren't there no more. big corps attend massive wealth and power. big techs yields massive power. all at the expense of lil people like us.</p>
<p>looking from my former 3rd world perspective, i feel like humanity is losing its battle. </p>
<p>what has this world come to?</p>

        <p>Honestly the big thing that has truly helped me is drugs.  Not street drugs, I started experimenting with natural things like mushrooms.  Recently I had an experience where I completely dissociated from my body and my self, my ego.  The body was crying but I felt free, because I realized that I am not the body, I am only experiencing it.  All this person's pain and joy and dreams and nightmares, it's like a movie I am watching, or a book I am reading.  The body is sad because it feels trapped and robbed, and I feel bad for it, but I don't personally feel those things.  It is only a story, it isn't me.</p>

 Stay safe though. I live with drugs, I live in the Netherlands, I can see the step towards something heavier is so much smaller and easier if you start with the 'easy' drugs. 
I have seen it so many times. Be cautious of that and have fun.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I try to do little things all the time. I still walk into stores without a mask sometimes even though they are mandated by law sometimes. I didnt even dare dream about that a few momths back. There are others taking theirs off as well sometimes or put the mask below their nose and I get big smiles sometimes (angry faces too ofcourse).</p>

        <p>Move to Texas or South Dakota here in the US if you can.  People are crazy here too but it's not nearly as bad in these two places yet.</p>

        <p>Thanks but I can't just move across the globe. From what I've seen the anti vs pro mask thing is freaking bizarre in the US. Here I can still walk into stores without a mask even though they are mandated by law now. Not a lot of dutch people will even dream about saying anything. </p>
<p>And I still love this little patch of earth over here. I have all my (althouvh insane pro mask, pro lockdown) family here and my daughter has all her friends here. </p>
<p>I'm glad to hear though that most red states are still staying somewhat sane in all this weirdness</p>

        <p>I understand.  I mentioned it only in case you didn't know and it WAS an option for you.  Moving like that, that far, especially these days, would require some dire need.</p>
<p>My family started homesteading a few years ago and while we're still figuring things out, it's very fulfilling.  It sounds like you live in the city, but you can still do a lot of homesteading style living in a city if you have a yard or plot of land available to you and it is weirdly soul satisfying.</p>
<p>I know it's winter, but if you want to give it a try there's plenty you could do now in preparation for spring.</p>

        <p>This is normal to feel like that and most of it will pass. I lived in martial law for 3 years, it was much worse than this.</p>
<p>I'd recommend to focus on your family and friends. Shut down the media, 100%, incl. this site if needed.</p>
<p>Try to live your normal life with normal routine - if you can't, create new routine, if you play games, get into online gaming where people talk to each other, even if they talk shit. Hearing other people voices, even random people, is going to fill social void a bit.</p>
<p>First and foremost don't comply, but please pick your fights wisely. Go out, don't wear the masks if you don't want to, but don't engage with people (incl. "authorities") trying to harass you - at all. Ignore, walk away.  You still have your rights.</p>

<p>You probably know they're talking about opening schools again for children. I'm pretty sure they're going to do so, under the requirement that children must be tested (negative) before they can enter the school.</p>
<p>Just a heads up. <a href="https://www.martinvrijland.nl/nieuws-analyses/biontech-had-al-in-2019-intranasaal-vaccin-delevering-the-messenger-en-crispr-lees-schrijf-toepassing/">Personally I don't trust these tests</a>. If I were in your position I'd keep my child at home.</p>
<p>Note: I don't agree with everything the author of that website writes, but he has some valid and interesting points.</p>

        <p>True. I still have my job and still see my family.
I threw out my tv, radio and newspaper many years ago, Iknew it was shit then and it's still shit today. Never had any social media either. It's the idiots around me that do it for me. My family hiding in their houses shivering, happy they can get the vaccine next week, thinking they'll be free again.

        <p>Luckily my family shares most of my views so no problem there. I do have friends though that they are scared shitless and believe every single thing spout out by msm. They actually believe that a random stranger on fb not wanting the vaccine is the cause of all this.
 Of course last year it was about the masks but you can’t reason with this sort of people so i just leave them be. We barely talk anymore.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry you are suffering - it's such a weird place we are living in, isn't it?</p>
<p>Even so, thanks for your comment, it helps me to see that I'm not the only one who thinks I'm going mad. Like you, I just don't get it. I just don't see how everyone is so wrapped in this and believe it is the end of the world if we go anywhere near back to normal.</p>
<p>I'm trying just to concentrate on myself now - keeping healthy, learning new skills, looking after my kids and doing my best to protect from the hysteria (I make sure to correct any nonsense they hear) .</p>
<p>I am doing stretching daily and working out. I'm trying to get into a meditation habit. I'm rebelling in what little ways I can - going out a few times a day, not wearing my mask etc. Connecting with like minded people on reddit has helped - without this sub and other anti-lockdown subs, I think I would have gone fucking nuts. Try to find someone in real life who has the same views - I have a family member who is strongly against this shit, so we can rant away to each other.</p>
<p>Just keep going. Stay strong bro/sister.</p>

        <p>Hey, fellow dutch resident here. I get completely how you feel, the dutch tend to masturbate to the news of new lockdown. </p>
<p>I wrote this recently:  Waar is de Nederlandse liefde voor vrijheid en koppigheid als je het nodig hebt? Hoe lang duurt het voordat je je realiseert dat er niet veel is om voor te vechten als we niet  stoppen met de lockdown? </p>
<p>I dont have particular coping advice...I mean i have my dog and my boyfriend next to me but that isnt enough, i get it. I also go to a psychologist for quite a while (for unrelated reasons) and meditate. It genuinely does help, its not just quackery  </p>
<p>You still feel it in the air, you still see the emptiness on our streets. If youre in the Randstad area and you wanna take our doggies for a walk feel free to shoot me a  message!  I have people around me but they're all zzzzing deeply and very afraid for their life! My boyfriend is also relatively normal in regards to the whole thing and thats what keeps me sane. Company of people who feel the same about this whole thing and realize life must go on. He's a saint in that regard because he's eternally positive and refuses to let himself be dragged into this mud of mainstream media fearmongering. </p>
<p>And yeah, screw rutte ;) i was never that big fan of the guy, i mean he's a talking head like many others lets face it. But i get it, i feel the change with people here. Much more rude, much more stressed, sometimes completely hysterical. I tell myself: if this keeps going on im off to the mountains in my home country! Im not gonna live in some police state hiding from some virus (that ok, you dont wanna catch, but still) afraid of Mark ruttes policies and the handhaving haha.</p>

        <p>Rule 1: dont blame yourself. Its not you who created this mess. You have more awareness than the government, and you are not a blind slave of the state. Thats already further than many people get. So your daughter has a smart parent.</p>

        <p>Scotland is in total lockdown until the end of January. I’m just getting on with it. Working from home, not visiting family - it sucks, but it is what it is. I’ve taken up a whole bunch of new hobbies: sewing; cross stitch; painting; and illustration - and I am really trying to appreciate every day. </p>
<p>I’m also recovering from surgery that makes it difficult to walk so it’s frustrating that I can’t get my daily exercise, but tbh, I’ve already lost colleagues and relatives to Covid-19, so I‘ll continue to follow the rules until the threat is minimal. </p>
<p>I mean, that’s it. We just have to get on with it. Chin up, eyes forward, make the most of a shitty situation. Try not to watch the news too often ;)</p>

        <p>Can I Just say one thing, I too was sceptical about this whole pandemic and then watched people around be infected and die to it, it’s NOT a joke or a hoax either, it’s a real thing that is killing people, just because it doesn’t affect you doesn’t mean it does not exist. I live in the U.K. and we have a strain stronger than the original, I have been in the same 4 walls working and same on the weekends since March last year, believe me I am sick of this and starting to reach a point of depression as I don’t have many friends and no partner in my life to fill the gap. Honestly if we all take this seriously it will be over quicker, that’s all I ask of anyone don’t take this as a joke as it certainly isn’t.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry if it looked like I was dismissing everything. I am not stating there is no virus, I am stating it is nowhere near pandemic levels. It sucks to see people get sick and die especially if it is someone you love (is that the case for you?) I understand. I lost many people in my life.</p>
<p>This virus can do damage yes, but you have to understand that is only a small minority. And instead of our government saying they would do everything they could to find a treatment they said from the very beginning a vaccine is the only way out. </p>
<p>They didn't care about all those people suffering in the hospital, they never looked for a treatment for those people. They told us we were to blame, ordered us to stay home and said the vaccine is the only way out.</p>

        <p>No I get what you are saying and don’t disagree with you at all and unfortunately yes close friends and no family members yet but very close to it.</p>
<p>I agree with you and I feel like the government are blaming the people when in reality they let people do what they want after it was too late, for them to then sit there and state is our fault as people is disgraceful.</p>
<p>To be honest the whole political side of things bores me at this point, all I want is to see my family and to live somewhat of a normal life again rather than being trapped in the same 4 walls.</p>
<p>I definitely don’t think it is a pandemic as it is only certain areas that it has such a high death rate, unfortunately I am in one of those areas so until a vaccine is administered and everyone gets it I will be much in the same position as I was last year, trapped.</p>
<p>I am trying to stay positive but it is very exhausting, especially with little social interaction but guess I have to make do with what I have, just try to stay positive it’s all we can do!</p>

        <p>Is there a new virus? All signs point to no. This is clearly all planned, and releasing a brand new virus onto the world seems like a huge risk for TPTB.  Why even release a virus if its existence can be fabricated so easily through media and manipulation?</p>

        <p>Not that deadly. Never said it wasn't deadly at all, or if I did I messed up in writing.
I know people die, I'm a nurse, I've seen it happen, I have seen the long term effects some people have after the disease and I had Corona as well myself including breathing difficulties. </p>
<p>Not saying it is not deadly at all. It is. But it is nowhere near the levels of dangerous that jutifies these measerments enforced by our government.</p>

        <p>Well, I think it is. The pandemic has killed almost 2,000,000 people worldwide and this number would be far more if we continued on with our lives as if everything was normal. Take for example the Australian State of Victoria. At around August 2020, Victoria and the UK were getting roughly the same amount of cases per day at 700ish. </p>
<p>You may argue that this is not enough cases to enforce a lockdown. But looking at the way the countries handled it, I think it's safe to say that lockdowns work.</p>
<p>Victoria immediately imposed a nationwide lockdown. No-one could leave or get into the state, or even the city. Leaving your home was not advised, and leaving your home without a mask was illegal. As of 13/01/21, Victoria has 0 daily new cases and 35 active cases.</p>
<p>The UK began to ease open, allowing resturants and bars to reopen, allowing people to go out in public maskless, and giving people more freedom to travel. As of 13/01/21, the UK has 45, 000 daily new cases and an unknown number of active cases.</p>
<p>People suggest that Australia was not hit as hard by covid because of seasonal differences, or low population density. This is not the reason (although it may have helped). It's because we listen to the people that are smarter than us. It's because when the person with the medical degree tells us to do something relating to health, we do it.</p>
<p>Not criticising the UK government here- far from it, I couldn't have done a better job myself. But which world would you rather live in? The one locked down for a month or two and then reopened, or the one where COVID deaths have now hit 1,000/day?</p>
<p>TLDR: Lockdowns really are effective. They prevent so much death and nip the cases off at the bud before they can spread. Yes, the restrictions suck- half my family wasn't able to make it home for Christmas this year. But I follow the restrictions, know why? I want them to be able to come home next Christmas.</p>
<p>Just needed a vent.</p>

<p>Congratulation, the fuck are you doing over here than? Go back to r/coronavirus if that's more fitting with your views</p>
<p>We can debate numbers but that'll undermine the 'we're doing it for the nurses/grandmas' statement. So let's not go there. I'm not looking for a debate anyway, there are different subs for that. Bye</p>

<p>Sounds you like assume something else won't kill them before then. I nearly lost my life to a bus collison in November (and honestly wish I had; this nonsense isn't worth living to see through). Next Christmas isn't guaranteed. Tomorrow isn't.</p>

        <p>&rt; This amounts to roughly 0.28% of the world population. This is worth a lockdown? </p>
<p>Yes, 10,000%. 0.28% of the world's population is a very big number. It may not seem like it, but think how many more it would be had there been nothing done about coronavirus. 2,000,000 people is around how many that died in the Vietnam War. This argument makes no sense. Granted, a load them would still have died even if people had completely and meticulously followed lockdown rules, but COME ON. Yes, it's worth a lockdown.</p>
<p>&rt; Sounds you like assume something else won't kill them before then </p>
<p>Wtf even is this argument? You're stupid with three zeroes. Your solution to the current health crisis is "People were going to die anyway." Seriously?</p>
<p>&rt; Then, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/kwgyd4/has_the_lockdown_crackdown_gone_too_far_jogger_is/">you are a sociopath</a>. </p>
<p>While I may be a sociopath, you may need to check your definition of sociopath, friend. A sociopath is someone who struggles with social connections and finds socialising in general really tough. It doesn't relate to whether or not I could do a better job than the health officials, who have been trained all their life, are the single best team of professionals in the country, and all have varying degrees in medicine, virology, or epidemiology, in the slightest.</p>
<p>You people are just feeding the dumpster fire. By doing whatever the professionals say not to do, you're giving the rest of us Covid. You really are a special kind of stupid.</p>

        <p>Surprise, surprise. You have nothing but insults, jumped over the harder questions, and didn't even read that link. What else is new?</p>
<p>0.28% wouldn't be a huge number of the US population. It's absolutely not of the world's.</p>
<p>&rt;While I may be a sociopath.</p>
<p>Well, that explains a lot.</p>

<p>That requires <em>having</em> COVID-19. All I have right now is a stomachache from eating too many pancakes.</p>
