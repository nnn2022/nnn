    <strong>am I being reasonable or overreacting? honest opinions please</strong>
    <p><p>I don't want the vaccine, I think it's unnecessary and potentially dangerous since it is untested in my opinion and covid has an extremely high surivval rate. also where I live we don't have any cases atm. I believe it's not really about the virus, but about control and big pharma profits</p>
<p>My wife normally pretty conservative but she is fearful of the virus, we have a toddler as well. she wants to get the vaccine even after I showed her all the sources that it probably isn't worth it. she says she wants our kid to get it when it's approved for young kids...</p>
<p>She is getting her shot next week. She is still breastfeeding. if something happens to our kid because of breastfeeding with the spike proteins in there, or if our kid were to get the shot in the future and something happens to him, I will want a divorce. should I tell her this or is that not appropriate?</p>
<p>she can make her own decisions for herself. but it affects our kid, which is why I'm so fired up about it</p></p>

        <p>Sadly you are being reasonable. I would NOT recommend breastfeeding post vaxxx, and women are being outright lied to and gaslit about unique and scary effects from the vaxx. Tons of reports of weird heavy periods, abnormal cycles. “Swollen lymph nodes” that are supposed to “resolve themselves,” which sometimes become fast growing breast cancers.</p>
<p>I’d compile a list of women’s stories like that to share. Unfortunately they often get deleted, modded to deletion, and censored pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I see them crop up daily on the Covidvaccinated sub and twochromosomes. The comments sometimes make it to dozens of other women sharing before the posts get censored. But you could see if you can point out women’s problems being reported to your wife.</p>

        <p>That's not going to help in this situation. They ate literally telling pregnant women to get it even though it's untested. All normal, sane guidance has been thrown out the window.</p>

        <p>The issue with breast feeding is while you actually have what ever substance in your blood stream </p>
<p>If you really were concerned you could have her stop breast feeding a few days after she gets the vaccine </p>
<p>As for the m spike protein the virus has it too so if you are concerned about the vaccine you should be equally as concerned about her contracting the virus </p>
<p>In all honesty she will be fine I wouldn’t worry to much over it </p>

        <p>I’m a physician with real world inpatient experience within a very large hospital system taking care of a patient population well into the 6 figures </p>
<p>This is not the Black Plague </p>
<p>This is something we have not seen before, this delta variant is exponentially more contagious then anything we have seen in decades </p>
<p>I understand that the 99% survival rate is a number that to most plebs seem insignificant but 1% is a lot in medicine </p>
<p>1 in 700 Americans are dead due to this virus </p>
<p>This virus is real and is overwhelming our healthcare system where I work as we speak </p>
<p>You want to make arguments as to the necessity of the vaccine for certain populations then fine, if you want to make claims that he government is over reaching its power and will be ripping our rights away from us under the guise of “protecting” us, then I’m all with you </p>
<p>But I will now allow someone to spread misinformation as if this virus is something run of the mill and something that’s not out of the ordinary </p>

        <p>I'm gonna call bullshit, if you are a doctor 1) Im the fucking tooth fairy 2) I wouldn't want to be your patient as you are a moron. The survival rate is actually 99.85% you fucking liar. "I'm a doctor but can't site a single study or link to prove my claim". Gtfo.</p>
<p>Oh and to your claim that hospitals are being overwhelmed...thats a lie too. Total hospitalizations from covid1984 since March 2020 is around 190k...thats not alot in a nation of 330 million. You are an uniformed hack spewing propaganda.</p>
<p>No. This is just low information low iq commie nonsense.</p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI, literally says 6ft or 60ft doesn't matter.</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Mask mandates dont work:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links or peer reviewed studies so take them with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8966883/Masks-DONT-stop-spread-Covid-experts-criticise-troubling-lack-evidence.html</p>
<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work and some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>

<p>https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/jun/27/why-most-people-who-now-die-with-covid-have-been-vaccinated</p>
<p>People dying from the vaccine itself:</p>
<p>https://covid-101.org/science/how-many-people-have-died-from-the-vaccine-in-the-u-s/</p>
<p>Your entire argument is but 600k died and believe the experts! Yeah they did...4 million world wide. Out of a population of 7.674 billion. That a raw mortality rate of less than 0.05%...the experts have been lying and have flip flipped so many times it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Already posted the survival rate by age group for the US. It'd 99.68% for anyone under 70. 95% of covid deaths are  people above 70 and half of those were from nursing homes. Nursing homes I might add that leftist governors like those of NY, NJ, MI, etc...put active covid patients in nursing homes. Ramping the numbers sky high.  So can we blame democrats for that? </p>
<p>Also why aren't they separating died with covid from died from covid? They do this with every respiratory illness known to man. Also why have we been keeping the clock ticking for 20 months now? Most colds go by a yearly cycle. Imagine if I did that to other diseases. Tb for example kills an average of 1.5 million people globally a year...if I kept the clock running for TB for 20 months that's 2.5 million dead.</p>
<p>We should have never shut down. UN estimates that 22-138 million are going to starve this year because of the lockdowns and interruptions in the global economy. That's over 5-35x the number that has died from covid. </p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/13/890398347/u-n-report-says-pandemic-could-push-132-million-people-into-hunger</p>
<p>https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/20th-anniversary-campaign/covid-related%20hunger-could-kill-more-people-than-the-virus</p>
<p>Don't see you virtue signaling about that...</p>
<p>We flattened the curve. Actually cases and deaths have been on the downtrend...especially as states have opened up. Florida and Texas are doing great. Florida never locked down and they have the most elderly per capita and still faired better than most of the heavy lockdown states. </p>
<p>This whole your gonna kill grandma thing is a joke. If covid was sooooo deadly than why have we caught democrat politicians ignoring thier own lockdown orders?</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-politicians-who-violated-covid-19-rules-guidance-list-2020-12</p>
<p>Also if the virus was such a big deal than why were the BLM "protests" permitted to happen for over a year? Media and the medical establishment tried to gaslight us and tell us those "protests" didn't spread covid. </p>

<p>If the vaccine worked than 1) how are vaccinated people getting and spreading covid? 2) why is Pfizer now talking about you have to take antivirals for covid after you take thier vaccine? 3) why is the cdc recommending masks for vaccinated people?</p>
<p>They lied and people like you got played.</p>

        <p>99.85% is the survival rate of the entire population </p>
<p>It’s is 98-99% of active infections depending on the population </p>
<p>It took you 10+ paragraphs to argue my statistic is wrong when in fact it’s an accurate stat </p>
<p>Secondly I never mentioned anything about mask mandates or anything in regards to mask or social distancing </p>
<p>Your mind is made up, you don’t care to actually listen to someone with an alternatives opinion then yours </p>
<p>All you care about is yelling and name calling.

        <p>No. Thats 99.85% survival based in infered infections...not total population. The raw survival rate for total population is like 99.995% you cant even get that right...pitiful. Also how I know you are lying about being a doctor...a doctor knows the difference between CFR, IFR and raw mortality rate. You are an idiot</p>

        <p>I think you need to have an honest conversation with her. My husband have some fundamental differences that became huge obstacles when we had kids. We got through them by being honest with each other about what we considered lines in the sand, and agreed to respect the workarounds.</p>
<p>Are you willing to switch to formula, will you follow any rules she sets in place, such as masks, small social bubbles, etc etc., what do you need to feel comfortable with getting your child vaccinated, what does she need to be okay with, so on and on.</p>
<p>You definitely need to discuss this, because you're both the parent of this child and you both want what's best.</p>

        <p>My dear friend I don't think you are being unreasonable enough. Your wife is about to walk down a very dangerous path that is fraught with all kinds of bad possibilities. While technically getting vaccinated is her choice and only she can be the one to make that decision for herself I am a very worried about the breastfeeding. </p>
<p>I am not sure if you are already aware but there is one case confirmed so far that a woman who was vaccinated passed Spike proteins to her baby through her breast milk and the baby died a day or two later. This baby was a healthy vibrant baby until the spike proteins entered its body and snuffed out its life.</p>
<p>I am not a particularly religious fellow but I do sincerely believe that there will be a place in hell, a special place, for people that vaccinate young children with this science juice. Covid has a virtually zero mortality rate on children and to vaccinate them with something that has a much higher mortality rate than the disease that we are so afraid of is criminal. </p>
<p>Furthermore these Spike proteins end up all over the place including the bone marrow, what will your wife think when in a few years from now your child has some type of leukemia. This vaccine cannot be removed from your body and there is no long-term safety data. </p>
<p>You mentioned divorce. I wholeheartedly agree. Just responding to your post is making me so mad on your behalf I don't know if I'm actually making sense. I wish you the absolute best of luck and I hope whatever your wife decides your child is healthy and safe.</p>

        <p>I think if she gets the shot, she needs to stop breastfeeding. I don’t think you are in the wrong for stating that. There has been no long term studies into how the vaccine could affect breastfeeding infants/babies. </p>
<p>I also do not plan to get the vaccine, due to the data on VAERS my mistrust of these major corporations, etc. </p>
<p>I pray your wife doesn’t fall victim to the fear mongering and changes her mind!</p>

        <p>For the love of all that is holy, please do not vaccinate your child.</p>
<p>They DO NOT NEED IT. Your child is NOT at risk. This is not a vaccine. What kind of vaccine allows you to catch, spread and die from the thing it is supposed to protect you against? </p>
<p>Use you heads, please. Your wife will be transmitting artificial spike proteins to your child.</p>
