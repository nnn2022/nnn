    <strong>My Bad Health Experience with a vaccination(2016)</strong>
    <p><p>Back in 2016 I took a vaccine to go on vacation to indonesia after I took it I couldn't eat for 1 month my stomach were making a lot of weird noises and everytime I tried to eat something I kept vomiting ü§Æ</p>
<p>I had to go to a doctor in indonesia and use antibiotics to eat again(I could have died if that was going on any longer) , finally that was fixed after I took the antibiotics , than I came back home and after some days something happened with my lungs and I started to cough a lot, it's like I contacted a coughing disorder and it hurts me when I was coughing and I had to cough a lot every hour or 2, I started to cough like  5- 10 times repeatedly, I felt like a old man while I was in my 20's and I had a sore arm that came back every once in a while(it made me feel weak and this lasted for 4 years straight and i also felt exhausted those 4 years</p>
<p>Since beginning of 2020 all those bad symptoms I had from the vaccine was finally gone and I felt cured and I'm glad I got blessed with that. </p>
<p>And suddenly the msm started talking about mandatory vaccines and this gives me anxiety because I know I had a bad experience before with vaccine, I just got cured from the previous one and I have a feeling this vaccine is a lot worse and it's not the same we normally inject we never had a RNA vaccine before also because it has been rushed for a overexxagerated virus and the people behind it don't have the best interest at heart. </p>
<p>After that experience with the vaccine I took back in 2016 I feel like not taking the risk at all.</p>
<p>I'm kinda worried they do gonna make it mandatory for everyone and listening to bill gates Ted talk how to decrease the world population with 15% with the help of vaccines and hearing everyone talk about the covid vaccines gives me anxiety and to be honest it scares me.</p>
<p>However I'm not anti vaxxer but I do believe this shouldn't be forced and I accept that it's true it can hurt people or even kill some people too.</p>
<p>I do wanna share my experience. </p>
<p>Condolences to everyone that did lose someone because of vaccination.</p>
<p>And if you know someone close that's hurting right now because of a vaccine, I hope he gets well soon and stays strong too üôèüèΩ</p></p>

        <p>Injecting toxins into your blood stream of course can cause many problems. As an immune reaction is made against everything that is not recognized by your body's immune, you get immune reactions even from the "healthiest" foods imaginable. So at the top, imagine what happens when you bypass all protective body layers injecting an alive virus, literally, into your bloodstream with instructions how to enter your own cells and push its dna into the cell's nucleus so your cell can look hostile to your immune system.  </p>
<p>So it is counter-productive to mandate drugging an entire country or the entire world on somebody's hunch. Unless you want to become GMO. And as you know there is no "virus pandemic" Pandemics affect everyone, not some.</p>

<p>Yes that was a toxic reaction, I never got a vaccine but have had an unknown or multiple unknown infections causing isues in my body for 5-6 years now and putting myself on a natural antibiotic treatment gradually stopped it and one of the last things it fought back with was just that and a sore throat with a lot of internal inflammation especially in my head. Not getting one myself because I would definitely be in the section of people that would be at risk of dying from it (which is obviously far higher this year from the live science experiment now being pushed on mankind). Of course I also can't get proof of being exempt from anything either as I'm my own doctor, I don't have one. Save for sewing together a major wound (which they even failed at to an extent) the medical industry has done a whole lot of nothing for me. It's a big scam, no one wants a cure to anything because there's no money in that. They just want to take care of symptoms and extend life while making a cash cow out of as many vulnerable people as possible.</p>

<p>I agree, they rather keep you sick or even more sick so you keep coming back because when you keep coming back that's even more money for them , after I got back home I never got to a doctor anymore and I just waited and hoped the health issues are gonna heal itself because I didn't trust any doctors anymore after the health damage I had to endure.</p>

        <p>I don't know from which company it was but it's the malaria vaccine and it was the CDC giving out the shots, back then I didn't know much about vaccine I didn't do any research and I just went there with my dad and my dad told me I have to be vaccinated to travel and it was to protect against malaria, maybe my dad knows more info who it's made by.</p>
<p>It also was my first vaccine as adult I never had a vaccine before and never had it as a child.</p>
