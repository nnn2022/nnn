    <strong>My impression of this sub</strong>
    <p><p>Actually i visited this sub for the first time and wanted to give you my impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am so glad to not live in the USA and every day there are new arguments for this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Litteraly 90% of the people here seem to have a cognitive deficite, which i wont judge because you cant change if you're retarded</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-I hope natural selection does it's job and shows you the new normal way - but not in this life and on this planet</p>
<p>All in all i am shocked and fascinated at the same time - what went wrong and when? Was it your lack of education or the way you were raised, but for sure it's very Individual for everyone living in this bubble</p>
<p>One last wish from me would be to permaban me from this sub otherwise i would have to take H2O2 and bleach my eyes. But even if i couldnt see the stupidity you are fabricating here - it would still be there and i cant forget this.</p>
<p>It really scares me but shows again that humanity lived the longest time already because we will go exstinct before any exogen effects could manage to do that.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention</p></p>

        <p>And what have we said that’s retarted? And you claim with have cognitive dissonance but doomers are the most closed minded people who only read opinion and “science” which politically supports their ideas</p>
