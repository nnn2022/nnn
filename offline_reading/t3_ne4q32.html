    <strong>Outside the Walls of Rome</strong>
    <p><p>*Please remove if the topic doesn't suit this subreddit</p>
<p>I just need to vent with a community of people that can hopefully relate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The world has been weird for a long while now. The world? Maybe just the west? Can't sit here and act like other nations haven't already been going through their set of genuine challenges.</p>
<p>The 2020's has disillusioned my view of humanity and our communities. At first I was down with following COOF restrictions because we didn't know what this thing was and the reason why we have leaders is so the group can act faster. We are supposed to put our trust in authority. Also... I was cool with wearing a mask because it's a norm in Japan and I really miss travelling there, so it felt kinda cool. HAHAHA.<br>
But dammit... </p>
<p>When we are given one set of instructions, and then another contradicting set of orders. When there is preaching of caring about the greater good but not a single discussion or plan for the other issues like mental health issues, self-deletion, people dying alone, people reluctant or unable to have medical issues treated, small businesses closing, families losing their homes due to lack of income or greedy landlords. And there is zero discussion about TRYING different cures like Vitamin C and D, and other medications (assuming these methods pose little to no actual risk if it doesn't work. It MAY prevent or lessen the coof... or do nothing and you can't die from taking the medication. Worth a short right? It's all about the public good right? No?? Wait what...?!).   </p>
<p>Then the "miracle" vaccines get pushed out... by companies that have totally waived their liability. "Yeah. we are here to help you! but  if we totally did it wrong and you croak. Lol sucks to be you".  The vaccine is to help with the coof.... it lessens symptoms... doesn't prevent transmission or contagion... and you still have to wear a mask and socially distance. OH! Plus.. heartAttacks,strokes,seizures,rashes,fainting,infertility. BUT THE COOF IS SO BAD GUYS!!!  </p>
<p>*****Possibly an unrelated portion of my rant**********</p>
<p>Maybe this is unrelated... but here is a question I have been pondering for a while... How can we be so technologically well off... and yet be going backwards? How can we have the best medical knowledge, understanding of psychological development, the internet with loads of great educational resources... and yet most kids (including my generation - I am in my late 20's) graduate with a limited ability to read, hardly any of us remember how to do basic math, there is rarely a lifelong interest in learning - most people I know don't read books, our societies are massively overweight, our family structures are breaking down, our values are perverting... essentially... what the hell is going on?   </p>
<p>A fair majority of people I know, know nothing. They assert opinions on ethics, family issues, religion, politics etc. with know genuine understanding. They heard it on the news, or listened to a podcast and stole the viewpoint. They know nothing of what they speak. Yet, these are the kinds of people that will scream at you for not masking, for not "following the science", for not getting the jab.  </p>
<p>It literally feels like we are re-doing the protestant revolution. "Science" is the new religion and "government" is the catholic church and politicians and "scientists" are the priests. The masses are so uneducated in science and critical thinking (similar to how people were unable to read the bible in those days), so they rely on the church (aka the cathedral) to translate the will of God. And us Martin Luther types are looking at this whole situation knowing the science (the will of God) is being twisted so the authoritarians can shape the public to their will. </p>
<p>We aren't yet at the part where we separate church from state and dethrone the tyrants. I expect it to be a lot like to protestant revolution where factions split off (mass cessation of states?)  followed by in-fighting and civil wars.  </p>
<p>*******************  </p>
<p>I feel like I am a fly throwing myself against the wall til I find the open window. I am lucky in my small town. Everything is relatively normal. Except I am reminded that I can't travel. My state is reasonably okay by the neighbouring ones seem to have a strain that knows when national holidays are.  I work in the human services and I am anxious that I may be pushed out of the industry either due to mandate vax's or repeated lockdowns. I can't afford to move out of my parents house because we have had  a mass migration from other states buying up all of the housing and driving up rental prices.   </p>
<p>Admittedly I probably do too much doom-scrolling and add more stress than needs to be felt. It just feels like we have only just begun.</p></p>

        <p>Your words resonate with me.  2020 was the year I became permanently disillusioned with society in general.  </p>
<p>All great civilizations decline or collapse.  Maybe this is just the cycle of life catching up to us.  I get joy from the simpler things in life these days.</p>

        <p>What slightly eases me is to take stock of exactly where we are in history. It can be hard to remember that we only started getting smartphone and touch technology within the last 10 years. I grew up with a big box television and phones stuck to the wall. The world wars were only 60-ish years ago and most of our modern technology came from that. In terms of modern civilization, we are very very very new to this.   </p>
<p>Point being, humanity has been through a lot in the last 100 years or so. Just a few generations. It may be unrealistic to assume we were gunna have it easy.</p>

        <p>Imagine having the neurons in a brain; most making hundreds of connections to other neurons nearby. Information is spread from one to the next, and as stimuli comes in, it gets processed in waves through arias first designed to deal with them, then echoing through the other parts, lighting up specific pathways that encode meaning.</p>
<p>Now imagine that suddenly, every neuron connected to every other neuron. Signals no longer take paths that encode meaning or make sense of stimuli. Every input signal becomes a noisy useless mess that outputs nonsense. This is commonly known as a Grand Mal Seizure; the kind with the loss of consciousness and violent spasms that you have likely seen depicted on TV.</p>
<p>Where was I going with this? Oh yes.</p>
<p>Imagine now that everyone in society is a neuron. Information about local events or personal issues, or what ever, are spread from person to person. The people you deal with regularly are your synaptic connections. Societal stimuli echos through a society like a signal through a brain. That is, until we suddenly have the internet and social media.</p>
<p>With the internet and social media, signals jump all over the place with random neurons (people) being rewarded for getting the most connections per signal. The most important thing becomes making sure your own stimuli are spread throughout the majority of the brain. In the meantime everyone else is doing the same. Local connections are lost.</p>
<p>Essentially...Society is going through a seizure. We shall see if it can survive.</p>

        <p>I can't help but have Nietzsche's death of god phrase come to mind. Religious or not, we may have knocked out the buttresses of our society and it's starting to crack under its own weight. Instead of one brain that drives the body, each cell is trying to drive the body and can't coordinate its direction haha.   </p>

        <p>The Far East is also going crazy. Our societies just do a better job hiding the bad and easing tensions with incentives. I can even claim people in China are just as anti-vaxx as we are. People in the West never stopped protesting and it's paying off without new surges.</p>

        <p>It is bittersweet to know the angst is shared. It's great to know that there are people out there fighting it, but kinda disturbing that it's so quiet. I understand the media is controlled and all... it's still kinda weird. Feels like we are all screaming in a room that prevents sound from travelling. If you get what I mean</p>

        <p>Very well articulated and hits every nail on the head. Damn, why can't we have intellectual and highly spiritual people like you in government? Our world needs to change. I think the technology we're using today is a means to help brainwash us, dumb us down, and make us easier to push us around, all for the purposes of being compliant slaves, and destroy our own critical thinking skills. There is something very evil working behind the scenes, wishing for our subservience. Maybe it's time we go back to more simpler times, the like the pioneers of old, or like how the Native Americans lived, or maybe something like the 1920's or 1950's? Heck, I'd go back to the 1980's in a heartbeat!</p>

        <p>A train of thought I have played with is that distraction is the enemy of wisdom. When you are distracted your brain can't digest the information it takes in. You don't have the empty space in the day or in life to just sit and reflect on your thoughts and experiences, and to integrate them. Entertainment is like junk food. Fine for weekends and celebrations but not good for daily consumption (I don't think this includes reading or listening to good quality music as these are slow and meditative).   </p>
<p>Furthermore, humans are highly suggestible. Think about your personal relationships. It is common for individuals in romantic relationships to unconsciously swap traits and quirks - styles of humour, ticks and speech patterns etc. Then what might being dosed with regular themes in music, tv, video games, and other media do to us? <br>
I don't think, for example, that violent entertainment leads to acts of violence. However, I do wonder if it dampens our empathy for violence. We can hear about a war in a foreign country and it is no more shocking than an action movie, sort of thing... this part is more tin-foil hat.   </p>
<p>Point is, I think there is something to be said for our intellectual diet.</p>
