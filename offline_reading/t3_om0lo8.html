    <strong>We're being domesticated by our owners</strong>
    <p><p>I was having a thought to myself while walking our dogs the other day, i had to shout at one of them for barking at another dog and then it hit me, we're being domesticated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Face masks are muzzles, we communicate with our faces, we can't tell if someone is happy or sad with those things on so we avoid conversation with strangers they also show compliance / ownership like a collar on a dog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccines (i believe) are castration, this gives them the power to cull certain populations, and control others, i think in the future we will have to be in high society to be able to have children and the rest of us will be a bill gates percentage stat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social obedience is something we're being forced into every day,  we're being told that you must be like the extreme left movement or you're a "bad dog!" by the media, forcing everyone to believe the same thing whether its trans gender, blm, pro mask, pro C19 vax, pro Israel, anti middle east etc. If you do not fall in line with the popular belief you will be shunned by the rest of society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food shortages and government reliance is obviously the next step, a domesticated dog wouldn't know what to do if they're suddenly cast into the woods to fend for themselves, so the dog relies on us to feed them their daily rations, they get to eat and sleep in a safe place so they don't know any difference, extra treats for good boys (government officials)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Euthanasia is also something we do to dogs when they're at the end,  I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen in the future but I'm presuming this will have some place in the retraining of the human being. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts or am I a crazy conspiracy man?

        <p>You are a man realizing that, at this point in world history, a crazy conspiracy is reality.</p>
<p>When you go down this realization and dig deeper, you will arrive in a world that finally makes sense and achieve enlightenment on many topics.</p>

        <p>Yeah I've been in balls deep ever since i watched zeitgeist 15 years ago,  i just realised the way we treat our pets is very much how they want to treat us, maybe the year will be 2030 and we'll own nothing and be happy,  maybe subservience is the way to happiness i don't even know anymore,  i do know that all my friends who don't care about any of this shit are happier than me ü§£ü§£ü§£</p>

        <p>I agree with all of that mate. I definitely think it's a possibility. Personally though I'd rather die on my feet. The next two years are going to get very spicy.</p>

        <p>That was my original plan but they moved to quickly to criminalise that.</p>
<p>I dont really care about taking the lonely stance. I'll live in the woods eating nuts and worms if I have to. I'm not going to subject myself to their bullshit.</p>

        <p>You are a man, forced to deal with a crazy conspiracy. Link up with people in your area and hold it down. Stock up on food and water. Plant crops. Barter goods. Buy guns and ammo. Have a plan if shit goes down. God bless. This is the book of revelations.</p>

        <p>It doesn‚Äôt take long for Pets to become wild again, the man who dad didn‚Äôt tell him women was a thing. He lived in the jungle and hunted animals. He now is struggling to adapt to the concrete jungles. He never brushed his teeth but he didn‚Äôt need fillings. His teeth weren‚Äôt white but they hadn‚Äôt fallen out. Dogs and cats want till attack birds and other animals as it‚Äôs in there DNA, just like humans wanting to hunt animals. Fat lazy dogs or animals wouldn‚Äôt want to hunt as they wouldn‚Äôt have the strength to do so. Animals become like there owners. My mums dog is a Japanese Akita mixed with a staff and is so loving but she‚Äôd kill a bird if given the chance or a human if they broke in.</p>
