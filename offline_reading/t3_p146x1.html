        <p>Can confirm. But it‚Äôs misdirected frustration. They should be mad at the people who allowed the research that was the impetus for the pandemic to begin with. Starting with Dr. Fauci. And then mad at the people who argued for a lockdown without clear benefit and zero consideration of its steep cost. But the media has given them a target and it‚Äôs reassuring to attack the single target you‚Äôve been instructed is not only OK, but in fact morally righteous, to fight: us. The great unwashed and unvaxxed. It is more complicated to understand the chain of events that led to our present, and to implicate the cast of characters responsible. Harder still is the realisation that you have been the problem all along, through your complicity, your fear-driven obedience, and your disregard for the most precious thing in human society: freedom. It is not frivolous. It is fucking rare. People who have never lived anywhere but somewhere it‚Äôs enjoyed do not appreciate what it feels like not to have it. Fascism was fucking popular. These people like being told what to do because it is sometimes easier than making your own decisions. They like it because they imagine the edicts will all be reasonable, and that human actors in power see more power as an end in itself. People who want lockdowns, and will get their 8th jab, do not understand people. They do not understand history. It is easier to blame us. The most insane irony is we are defending their freedom, too. Their right to not be the property of the State. They won‚Äôt thank us. But fuck ‚Äòem. We gotta do it.</p>
