    <p><p>It is still unclear to many why the coronavirus will lead to a Chinese model of technocratic communist system.</p>
<p>Most will think that it is really necessary to contain the coronavirus, that we keep five feet away and that vaccines should become mandatory. Most of the time, this requires some police-state action. They consider that the only way to get the sleepers in line.</p>
<p>Fake news about fired 5G masts (actually 3G and 4G masts) should give the impression that there are conspiracy thinkers walking around who think that 5G causes coronavirus phenomena and unfortunately there are controlled safety net pawns who have said so too (like David Icke).</p>
<p>Yet 5G can simply be used to monitor your brain and your DNA and to transfer it in real time. Let me list the scientific evidence (so: no conspiracies) clearly for you. Just mainstream evidence anyone can look up.</p>
<p>Brain computer interface (BCI): reading and transcribing thoughts:</p>
<p>I recommend taking a look at the video below to find out what Silicone Valley investor Steve Hoffman has to say. Please remember that it really is not about conspiracy theories. These are the facts; this is the scientific state of affairs in the here and now. That topic is also discussed in the video below (and read more below).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_TQBjFkv1Q">Steve Hoffman - Brain Hacking &amp; MindTech - Produced by DingDingTV</a></p>
<p>Having watched the video, you have discovered that the technology already exists to not only read your thoughts, but also to overwrite them. This applies to real time thoughts, memories and dreams. You have also been able to see that you can look through your eyes from a distance. That almost calls for a Microsoft operating system including firewall to keep your brain safe in the network. Bill Gates anybody?</p>
<p>DNA reprogrammable from the cloud:</p>
<p>Isn't it a bit far-fetched to say that you can reprogram human DNA from the 5G network? It is only if you have been influenced by the "conspiracy thinking" stigma. But it is not a conspiracy; it's just the current state of science. A method that has been in advanced development for years is the CRISPR method. This technology enables search and replace functionality to trace and replace pieces of DNA and RNA. Watch the video below to discover what makes CRISPR possible (and read on below).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tw_JVz_IEc">TED-Ed How CRISPR lets you edit DNA</a></p>
<p>If you have watched that video and have discovered that every piece of DNA and RNA in our body can be modified, then the only question remains whether this can also be done from the cloud and specifically via a 5G network. To start with, the remote activation of the CRISPR gene editing machinery was possible <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/devices/light-activated-gene-editing">early as 2019</a> using infrared light.</p>
<p>From article: 'Engineers make their mark on the most popular biotechnology product. Chinese scientists reported today that they can control the gene editing program CRISPR-Cas9 with light. The method replaces the use of viruses traditionally used to provide CRISPR gene editing machines, and gives scientists temporary control over the tool, the researchers said. They published their findings in the journal Science Advances. The technique has the potential to accurately attack and kill "cancer cells", said Yujun Song, an author of the paper and a professor at Nanjing University's College of Engineering and Applied Sciences in China.' (From article above from 2019)</p>
<p>If you replace the word cancer cells with 'every cell' in the above section, it will already become a bit spooky and you may already get the smell of 'conspiracy thinking' again, but we just need to know about the technological state of affairs, so let that stigma.</p>
<p>Infrared light is of course not yet a 5G network. 5G is simply a data network that operates at a high frequency and therefore enables high bandwidth for internet traffic. What is interesting to know, however, is that 5G works at such a high frequency that it can cause a temperature increase. We just read that on the website of the Reuters news agency, so it cannot be dismissed by the fake news checkers as "fake news". Just read what Reuters says about 5G: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-coronavirus-5g/false-claim-5g-networks-are-making-people-sick-not-coronavirus-idUSKBN2133TI">False claim: 5G networks are making people sick, not Coronavirus</a></p>
<p>From article: 5G uses beam-forming technology, allowing radio frequency electromagnetic fields to go directly where needed. The International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) has released 2020 guidelines for limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields after 7 years of research. They contain information about 5G. The committee says that the main effect that radiofrequency electromagnetic fields have on the human body is an increased temperature of exposed tissue. The body can handle small increases in body temperature, such as through exercise, but radio frequency exposure and elevated temperature can be dangerous above a certain threshold. According to the ICNIRP, “Another common characteristic of RF EMFs is that the higher the frequency, the lower the depth of penetration of the EMFs into the body. Since 5G technologies can use higher EMF frequencies (&rt; 24 GHz) in addition to those currently used (&lt;4 GHz), the power of those higher frequencies will be absorbed more superficially than that of previous mobile telecommunication technologies […]. Accordingly, 5G exposures do not harm, provided they meet the ICNIRP (2020) guidelines “</p>
<p>So according to the guidelines, heating by 5G radiation occurs only on the surface of the skin. The question now is whether that is enough to turn on the very latest CRISPR machinery. The CRISPR machinery responds to an increase in temperature. You can then activate the editing via CRISPR via warm-up. The scientific publication platform ACS Chemical Biology describes this technology as follows: <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acschembio.9b01005">Heat-Triggered Remote Control of CRISPR-dCas9 for Tunable Transcriptional Modulation</a></p>
<p>From article: We demonstrate that dCas9 fused to the transcriptional activator VP64 is functional after heat activation and, depending on the number of heat pulses, drives the transcription of endogenous genes. Our study establishes a non-invasive and targeted approach to harness Cas-based proteins for modulation of gene expression in addition to current methods of cell function remote control.<br>
Basically, heat pulses can be thought of as a kind of binary code (like in a computer) to make the CRISPR machinery remotely reprogram cells. The heat pulses form, as it were, the connection bridge over which the reprogramming code is sent, like current pulses do that in your computer and light pulses do that over fiber optic cable.</p>
<p>Mandatory vaccination and the side effects:</p>
<p>If we take into account that military institutions such as DARPA are usually much further than mainstream science, we could still come to the conclusion that if a possible coronavirus vaccine contains this CRISPR machinery, the human genome can be remotely rewritten (adapted). turn into.</p>
<p>Of course, that also applies to the terrible and deadly covid-19 virus and any future mutations, but it is a useful side effect that a government can maintain your body. And since the Dutch state has actually become the legal owner of your body via the organ donation law, it only needs your DNA to be able (and allowed to) do this. Those covid-19 tests may be useful for that. Then you immediately scrape some DNA with it.</p>
<p>So we can say that a possibly mandatory coronavirus vaccine, possibly contains the CRISPR machinery. That CRISPR machinery is actually a kind of design virus. It has the properties of a virus; it looks like a virus. A vaccine is a virus built in a laboratory. As a layman we will never be able to make the distinction.<br>
It may well be that there will even be public progress that the new vaccine is one based on CRISPR technology. In addition, the threat of mutating coronaviruses or the threat of unknown new viruses may be used to sell this solution to the masses. Most people only see the solution and ignore the threat. That is being dismissed as a conspiracy theory. They are the group that also cried out after the threat of terrorism when they surrendered privacy: "Well, I have nothing to hide and I trust the government".</p>
<p>So if a government has tested everyone for covid-19, everyone's DNA is known. You can put that in a national (or worldwide) database and then the combination 5G plus vaccine makes it possible to adjust everyone's DNA.</p>
<p>Why is that five feet so important?</p>
<p>If the CRISPR machinery can be turned on via heating and thus (as mentioned above) via the 5G network, then you need to generate some kind of heat beam. This is only possible if you ensure that there is no one around that person, of whom you do not want the CRISPR machinery to be activated via a temperature increase. Although the coronavirus is given as the reason, you might wonder if this is not the real reason. I understand, that smacks of conspiracy thinking again, but I really showed you the technological state of affairs with hard evidence. The only question that remains is whether you can create such a heat beam with a 5G network. Please read the above press release from Reuters again or watch this video. You will then see that beam forming is indeed possible. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6li8CZmrg84&amp;feature=emb_title">Use of mm Wavelengths &amp; Beam Forming with 5G</a></p>
<p>So a meter and a half ensures that the CRISPR machinery of one individual could be turned on. Then, of course, we start from the hypothetical idea that an upcoming vaccine contains this CRISPR machinery. The one and a half meter society is therefore very important if you place it in the light of being able to control (read and write) the body and mind of each individual.</p>
<p>What can we expect in the short and long term?</p>
<p>In the short term, we can expect to get mandatory apps first, with which we will be monitored everywhere. These apps will not only keep track of whether we keep enough distance and whether infections are moving around us, but will also subject us to frequent health checkups. Then the systems will gradually be integrated with each other and we can look forward to a Chinese model sesame credit points system, in which we can no longer travel from A to B and take public transport or airplane if we do not have enough points.</p>
<p>If all of this is also linked to our brain via the brain-crypto system patented by Microsoft and if we also get a digital ID (with vaccine certificate), the system is complete and everyone is a definitive slave in an inescapable surveillance web.</p>
<p>The video below gives a good impression of this. You can see how far it is already in China. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g&amp;feature=emb_title">How China Is Using Artificial Intelligence in Classrooms | WSJ</a></p></p>
