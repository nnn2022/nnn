        <p>Chemically speaking it is an amino acid that your body needs to function that has a hydrogen replaced with a sodium ion. The human body has shown that it can easily turn this into the base amino acid.</p>
<p>You don't want too much of course especially if you live in America because our salt intake is already ridiculous. But a little should be fine</p>

        <p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor additive that is commonly added to canned vegetables, soup, processed meats and Chinese food. While generally recognized as safe by the FDA, MSG is an additive that can cause health concerns when consumed consistently. A buildup of MSG in the system is termed as MSG toxicity.</p>
<p>MSG is a brain neurotoxin that can largely be considered a slow poison. Often disguised as a flavor additive by terms including “natural strawberry flavor” and “other natural flavors,” it is often difficult to pinpoint MSG in products. As such, repeated consumption of the additive serves as a silent but lethal poison.</p>
<p>Regular consumption of the product quickly leads to a number of associated symptoms, strategically named MSG toxicity. Symptoms of toxicity can be complex and difficult to identify. Nonetheless, common symptoms include headache, flushing, sweating, facial pressure and muscle tightness. Numbness, tingling in the extremities, heart palpitations, chest pain, nausea and weakness are all common.</p>

        <p>Methylmercury vs ethylmercury.</p>
<p>One is nerve hurting juice, the other is just mildly poisonous. The preservative you're concerned about has an ethyl group on one side and a whole bulky molecule on the other side. That stuff is neither going to release mercury atoms or ions nor randomly methylate some DNA. Methylmercury which accumulates in fish loves to do both of those things.</p>

        <p>I am aware of the differences between C2H5Hg+ and CH3Hg+.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt;&rt; <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqc/human-health-criteria-methylmercury">Human Health Criteria - Methylmercury | Water Quality Criteria | US EPA</a> </p>
<p>EPA methylmercury and ethylmercury limits are both 0.1 micrograms of HG per kg of human body weight. Flu shots have 25 micrograms, which means that unless you're 250 kgs, then you're being overdosed with Hg.</p>

<p>\&rt;&rt;&rt;Blair AMJN, Clark B, Clark AJ, Wood P. Tissue concentrations of mercury after chronic dosing of squirrel monkeys with thimerosal. Toxicology. 1975;3(2):171-6. </p>
<p>TLDR: Squirrel monkeys dosed intranasally with thimerosal or saline for 6 consecutive days. Compared to saline group, mercury concentrations in thetThimerosal group were significantly raised in the brain, liver, muscle, and kidney. Conclusion - “accumulation of mercury from chronic use of thiomersal-preserved medicines is viewed as a potential health hazard for man.” </p>

<p>TLDR: @ 0.02% concentration of methylmercury, ethylmercury had the ability to reduce the feasibility of human cells invitro. </p>

<p>TLDR:  Ethylmercury chloride killed off half of a test population of mice—a classic “LD50” (lethal dose) study—within a week at a concentration of 12 milligrams of mercury per kilogram of body weight; methylmercury chloride’s LD50, meanwhile, lethal to half the mice was 14 milligrams. </p>

<p>\&rt;&rt;&rt;  Tryphonas L, Nielsen N. Pathology of chronic alkymercurial poisoning in swine. Am J Vet Research 1973; 34: 379-392. </p>

<p>TLDR:  Neurotoxicity of both mercury types was broadly comparable. Higher levels of inorganic mercury were found in the kidneys and brains of rats that were fed ethylmercury, though more brain damage was seen in the methylmercury-fed rats. </p>

<p>TLDR:  Mice injected with Thimerosal accumulated mercury in both the brain and kidneys. After 7 days, mercury levels decreased in the blood but were unchanged in the brain compared to levels measured just twenty-four hours after treatment, indicating slow clearance. </p>

<p>TLDR:  Rat pups given either Thimerosal or inorganic mercury three times in their first 11 days of life, mimicking human infant vaccination schedules. The scientists then assessed the total retention of mercury and excretion over six days. The Thimerosal-exposed rats showed higher mercury retention rates in their brains, in line with some other results described in this chapter. Furthermore, these Thimerosal-exposed rats exhibited similar faecal excretion and much lower urinary excretion compared to the inorganic mercury-exposed rats. That second group also demonstrated higher retention rates of mercury in organs other than the brain.</p>
