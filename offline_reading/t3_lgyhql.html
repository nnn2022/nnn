        <p>A very small percentage of this sub actually believes this. Most of us agree the virus is real but has been blown out of proportion. Maybe if you actually browsed this sub you would know that.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's a hoax, I think it's a very real illness. I don't doubt that people died.</p>
<p>What I also think is that said illness is blown out of proportion, that the numbers are manipulated and that it's very beneficial for governments to keep controlling people with masks and lockdowns. This showed them how far they could go while having people still complying which is why they're holding onto it.</p>
<p>I would reply "sorry for your loss", btw.</p>

        <p>No one thinks it's a hoax. We're against the useless, ever changing guidelines, extremely harmful overreach and the insecure, insignificant, authoritarian Karen's who think they're morally superior for suddenly being pro-life.</p>

        <p>you can rebrand any death as covid - which has been done over and over again. there is no covid.  the virus has never been proven to exists . slapping a scientific label on sth is not science - it is labeling.</p>

        <p>"Virus" was never isolated, koch's postulates never fulfilled. So yeah, it's safe to say it doesn't exist. People are getting sick though, and I know why because it happened to me years ago.</p>

        <p>No, although notoriously unreliable PCR tests do produce an unknown (but significant) amount of false positives - hence the CDC recently changed its guidance to what we'd been saying all along.</p>

        <p>The virus is not a hoax. The response to it is absolutely over the top ridiculous. I know several people that have had it including one elderly, diabetic, recovering cancer patient. She thought she just had a cold. My boss had it. Said he had colds way worse. I only know one person who died while having covid at the time. He was elderly, obese, diabetic, and ate absolutely horrible. You could smell the bacon from his house before even entering. I honestly was surprised he was still alive to be honest. So I don't believe covid killed him. It just might have tipped the scales out of his favor, but he was going to go soon anyway considering his health and lifestyle habits. So when someone claims a young healthy person died from covid, I seriously doubt that covid killed them. Most likely they had an underlying condition they didn't know about yet. And the excess deaths?? Caused by lockdowns, not the virus. All lockdowns do is drive people to gather in private groups because they can't do anything else, or lost their jobs and livelihoods and need social interaction, thereby driving up infection rates. Suicides and drug overdoses have been off the charts this year too. Humans are social creatures and to deny that is simply not human</p>
