    <strong>Tenants/Main Points to Be Stickied?</strong>
    <p><p>First, I want to be sure I say thank you to everyone here! If there is ever a satisfactory normal again it will be with your collective efforts.  </p>
<p>Is there any sort of centralized tenants and talking points already in pace that we could sticky? If we're going to make a dent into public perception we need to align/fine tune our points. </p>
<p>I'm relatively new to reddit and this sub so if it's something I missed I apologize. </p>
<p>This is something I've thought of for a bit now but what spurred me even posing this request was the post comparing wearing masks to the star of david during holocaust. I'm fully of the mindset that things I don't agree with should be allowed but I think that post was a considerable misrepresentation of the general "NoNewNormal" consensus and it's actually a really poor comparison. It got me thinking, how many posts like this are just detractors and confusion. </p>
<p>It might help to have a stickied megathread on different views of what is going on and what represents the best talking points. People can propose changes, suggestions, pick at points etc and we can continuously hone the message. There could be sections on masks, lockdowns, PCR testing etc. </p>
<p>I'm sure many of you would have better points but here are some of my critiques of mask usage:</p>
<p><strong>They're not proven to be effective at preventing infection</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"A <strong>cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles</strong>. As discussed in an earlier CIDRAP <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/commentary-covid-19-transmission-messages-should-hinge-science">commentary</a> and more recently by Morawska and Milton (2020) in an open letter to WHO signed by 239 scientists, <strong>inhalation of small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2</strong>, the virus that causes COVID-19."(<a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</a>)</li>
<li>Nobody contends that masks don't reduce large particles however it's widely accepted the small particles that are most likely responsible for infectious transmission are not filtered by traditional cloth masks. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>They're potentially harmful (cloth masks especially)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm." but more importantly "The control arm was â€˜standard practiceâ€™, which comprised mask use in a high proportion of participants. As such <strong>(without a no-mask control)</strong>, the <strong>finding of a much higher rate of infection in the cloth mask arm could be interpreted as harm caused by cloth masks</strong>, efficacy of medical masks, or most likely a combination of both.  <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</a></li>
<li>Studies have not confirmed this at this time, but cloth masks were historically not recommended for long term use for a number of reasons. I've read medical opinions that the results of this study pointed to the idea that cloth masks served as a potential breeding ground/collection mechanism for bacteria/viruses. Considering accepted medical theory indicates worse outcomes for higher viral load exposures, this one procedure alone could actually be exacerbating infections and worsening outcomes. This could be countered by suggesting the "more effective" surgical/medical masks (as outlined in the study above) should be required for use but without a study that includes a control for non-masked participants we have no way to establish effective protocol. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Masking children feels like child abuse and we don't know the long term effects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, no kids here, no judgement to any parent, I have basically nothing to lose and I still concede to wearing masks at times which is laughable. Facial expressions are a huge part of early childhood development. Facial expressions are universal across all humans (in general) and non-verbal communication can actually become a very effective skill. Never mind the potential health impacts beyond infectious diseases. Reduced emission of CO2 and increased force required to intake oxygen may not be presently detected as harmful but in general, oxygenation is a key measurement in health and long term health impacts to prolonged mask use in children is not studied. </li>
<li>Seeing the constant reminder that everyone is apparently scared for their lives is akin to the bomb drills during the cold war. I would consider masks emotional terrorism because the actual risk to the child is minimal, the efficacy of the mask as a prevention is highly suspect, and the mishandling of mask material which is apparently full of deadly virus demonstrates the entire procedure is fully ritualistic. </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there could be better formatting/points you great people could make but I just wanted to provide an example and toss some ideas out there.</p></p>

        <p>Weekly NoNewNormal chat/vent/support post and Reminder: don't feed the trolls appear to be the two currently stickied posts. You have to view the sub by itself rather than your home screen or something to see it. But I wasn't sure if perhaps there was somewhere else I'm missing. Thanks for the comment!</p>
