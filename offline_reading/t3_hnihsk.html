        <p>The article is in dutch. Just watch the movie. It shows dutch teens on holiday in Abufeira.</p>
<p>The local corona rules permit a 2 meter distance and you have to wear a face mask. </p>
<p>From what I can tell they have an accurate risk estimation: </p>
<p>The risk of not getting laid is bigger than the risk of mortality.</p>
<p>Sorry, for that lame joke.</p>
<p>I notice this myself as</p>
<p>I also went to a party last week with people in their mid twenties ( I am too): nobody cares about corona.</p>
<p>Even my parents went to a cafe and when the police drove by people pretended to socially distance until they left.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands the hysteria is over.</p>
<p>As it should be. Society does not solely exist for people vulnerable to corona.</p>
<p>99.4% should not be held hostage by 0.6% of the population.</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>It is not really friendly to the host country though, that I do acknowledge.</p>

        <p>There's a reason that the hysteria is over in the Netherlands, the new cases and hospitalizations are waaaay down. This is not the case for the US where people seem to think that it's over there too when their peak is right now. I can tell you that nobody was in bars in the Netherlands when we had our peak.</p>

        <p>That is because bars were closed dude.</p>
<p>They were closed by law.</p>
<p>You are partially right in that people were more serious back then.</p>
<p>But if you had opened the bars and clubs back then I promise you half of them would still be full.</p>
<p>I do agree it has to do with the amount of cases too.</p>
<p>But a lot of people are starting to realize that what we have now is another form of a hostage situation.</p>
<p>A vaccination or no old normal.</p>
<p>People won't wait that long to behave a normal. 80% of the people I know are not going to change their behaviour if cases start rising again. Why should they?</p>
<p>Why should we let the government decide when to dance again? </p>
<p>IC?</p>
<p>Yes bad, but worse is 2.5 more years of this. The average age is 80 years old. It is not justified to force society on its knees for the maximum survival chance of old people. Society is bigger than just covid19.</p>

        <p>Old people, people with diabetes, not to mention what happens to other urgent care when hospitals get full. The average age of deaths now might be 80 (I think it's a little less) but that number drops real quick when hospitals reach their capacity. </p>
<p>Clubs are 100% going to open before there is a vaccine, you just need to have very good contact tracking in place and be ready to identify new cases quickly. </p>
<p>I think that society can function just fine with a few of these new precautions for a year or two. It just bothers me that people can't be understanding of why this is happening and constantly assume the worst. Whether that is horrible government tyranny or Bill Gates chipping people. </p>
<p>And don't get me wrong we should absolutely be extra vigilant in these times to check that our governments don't go too far, but I think too many people throw out reasonable caution and instead just go into full contrarian mode and demand absolute inaction of the government which I think is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>I need a Dutch girl to bring me over...hope this happens when we go back to college here but the security theater they are putting on is ridiculous. Mandatory masks, half-occupied dorms, no visitors, etc.</p>
