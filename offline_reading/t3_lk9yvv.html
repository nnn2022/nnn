        <p>I used to be very pro-vaxx, but after seeing how sketchy big pharma is being about this particular vaccine, I realized they are likely being equally as sketchy about other vaccines. So I’ve decided to only get vaccines that protect me something very dangerous that I might actually get (tetanus, meningitis etc). Will be passing on flu and similar from now on</p>

        <p>And they have! And now you know what all the "crazy anti vaxxers" have been on about. People losing their minds they can't sue if damaged by the covid shot but not realizing that's every shot in america. Suddenly aware shots have side effects. I was super pro, until I got shingles from the shingles shot, tried to tell my sort and was greeted with billions of dollars of marketing calling me a liar. So I kept getting more,  the next round I got (tdap and flu for pregnancy) messed up my GI tract so bad I've been underweight and tachycardic for 5 years. But super safe and effective</p>

        <p>AND they became less effective. Kids need at least 3x the MMR now than in the 80s and still might not gain proper antibodies. So since 1986, manufacturers were no longer liable, and the shots became less effective. No question they are putting out a cheaper, less effective product since 1986. They were required to do annual reports and never did after that too. What if we gave car manufacturers zero liability? Does anyone really believe cars wouldn't be getting built with cheaper parts?</p>
<p>Eta: and new cheaper adjuvants means new and worse reactions.</p>

<p>Actually, tetanus is one of the most fake vaccines there is.</p>
<p>As to meningitis, healthy people very rarely get it. You're more likely to get meningitis if you have a problem with your immune system. But the vaccine damages your immune system!</p>

        <p>I'm 100% anti-vax. Name me one vaccine that is both safe and effective. There are none.</p>
<p>Typically, when I ask this question from the vaccine bots, they name polio, smallpox or tetanus. Polio and tetanus vaccines are obvious fakes (see on tetanus and meningitis in this thread). As to smallpox, it’s also a clear fake, but the problem with it is that it’s the oldest vaccine, and the diagnoses through the ages have been problematic. 150 years ago they often confused smallpox with some other similar skin diseases.</p>
<p>At this time, smallpox has NOT been “eradicated”, they just renamed it as chickenpox.</p>

<p>See, that's the problem. That one word: "we."</p>
<p>No, you see, "we" should not be following medical advice. That implies that "we" are a group, or a herd, to all act together in unison.</p>
<p>That's insane. You follow what medical advice you want to follow, I'll follow what medical advice I want to follow, and we each can have happy lives. There is no reason for us both to operate together as a "we." </p>
<p>You further compound the problem by not only lumping everyone together in a "we," but also lumping all medical professionals in together under the "medical advice" heading, as if it's all the same. It is not.</p>
<p>Some doctors may tell you to never drink alcohol, some may tell you that a glass of red wine a day is good for you. It's up to you to make your own decisions, and up to me to make mine. "We" do not need to do the same thing. </p>

<p>You seem naive. I would recommend you spend more time in the natural world. Perhaps it would ease your suffering to learn that every single animal, plant, and organism on the planet operates in its own self interest. Even apparent acts of altruism are done for the benefit of either yourself directly, or your genetics.</p>

<p>You seem to be conflating the concepts of delayed gratification and long term thinking with being not selfish. Not doing what immediately feels good can be productive and efficient in the long term for the community (and therefore <em>yourself</em>), no doubt, and it's probably, shall we say, preferable behavior. Perhaps even universally preferable behavior.</p>
<p>&rt; To rise above and work cooperatively so we can ALL do collectively better than we otherwise would have if we were divided?</p>
<p>I don't disagree, but ask yourself one question: why? Why would we all come together and work cooperatively? I would posit that the answer is not some misguided altruism where people cast their selfishness aside, as that does not actually exist. No, the answer for <em>why</em> people might come together and work cooperatively is for all of their own individual selfish benefits.</p>
<p>There is a lot of propaganda in the world to encourage you into a collective mindset. Everyone wants you to think as part of their group. Whether it is a religion, an ideology, a political party, or just a meme. There is immense benefit in participating with others as a group, and there is also immense danger. The concept itself is not sacred, and importantly, does nothing to eliminate the selfishness of human beings that is innate in all of us. </p>
<p>&rt; Isn't that supposed to be what differentiates us from the savage beasts though?</p>
<p>And I'll leave you with this: the difference between us and the savage beasts is only perspective.</p>

        <p>"the only thing that truly matters is our own individual perspective(read experience)" the same way each capable adult is responsible for the health of their own body? And my health is NOT someone else's responsibility? I choose to not smoke, while others choose to. They choose to put harmful smoke into their lungs. They also harm others with secondhand smoke, I still don't get why no smoker has been charged with manslaughter or some form of killing someone else...because it can't be proven? But we know it happens. <br>
I choose whether or not to eat junk food, or take nutritional supplements, or get enough sleep. These all have effects on a person's immune system. And as a physically and mentally capable adult, those are my decisions for my own body, because I am responsible for my health. <br>
Don't tell me I'm responsible for someone else's health when I don't control their immune system strength. I can't make them take supplements, etc, but that is what anyone says that claims "everyone as a group is responsible for everyone else's health". Except they want to force people to wear masks and social distance, and now some even want to force people to get a vaccine.</p>

<p>(1) That doesn't happen. Using the passive voice doesn't change that in actuality, it <em>never</em> just magically "becomes known" that "we" "should" be doing something. There's almost never unanimity, and when there is it's more often than not later proven to have been hasty, and even if there were near-unanimity I don't remember saying I agree to democracy. </p>
<p>(2) a sane level of selfishness is absolutely normal, proper, and acceptable. I want you to have to live in terror of the coronavirus forever if it's a choice between that or me living in terror of the unknown-unknowns of what an extremely new and untested mRNA therapy might do to my body in the long term. I'm not even sorry. There just isn't any contest between you having to learn to live with how the world is, and me having to let some crusty old GP I wouldn't trust over the internet these days stick a novel therapy into my arm because the labcoats say they don't foresee <em>too</em> many longitudinal harms.

        <p>The actual medical advice being given is very different from the measure the state is taking (in a lot of places).  Doctors say lockdowns should only be a last resort option when hospitals are reaching capacity (which hasn't happened once yet since the first two weeks of lockdowns).  They also say masks aren't nessesary on people who aren't sick.</p>

        <p>Yup.  There's definitely an information problem.  Lots of information.  Lots of disinformation.  Lots of incomplete information.  Lots of sponsored information.  Lots of politically motivated information.  Lots of emotional information.</p>
<p>We need a better way of sorting through the mess and getting to the truth.  Then make the correct decisions for the right reasons.</p>
<p>I think that would solve some big issues quickly if we could really do it.  I don't really have much faith we're even trying to get there right now.</p>
<p>I also worry the "Fake News" deal people are talking about recently might just be turned into another propaganda tool instead of being a voice of reason in all this.</p>

        <p>It’s almost if someone stands to benefit from a country divided and locked down. Maybe the control of valuable information is what the ultra rich is throwing big sums of cash at to keep from the public. Through the political system, through age old professions like lawyers and law, and doctors and medicine. Maybe the internet is a threat to their dominance and this pandemic was just timed well enough for them to keep the people from seizing power through information control. Why they silence and moderate social media in somewhat arbitrary means or why they limit news to local information or within country events.</p>

        <p>It is a myth that doctors are required to take the Hippocratic Oath.  The whole branch of biomedical ethics has shifted from "Do no harm" to how they can excuse whatever abomination they wish to foist onto the general public.</p>

        <p>Not even the deaths - they like to harp on 'long covid' but conveniently forget that drawn out difficulties isn't a novel phenomena from pneumonia caused by only sars-cov-2 or that manual ventilation was actually doing more harm than good - or that most of these ICU cases could have been avoided with cheap and effective anti-malaria drugs or maybe spending some of the insane amounts of free money on a campaign of wide-spread preventative health measures like testing peoples blood levels of vitamin D, Vitamin C, magnesium, and zinc - then hyper supplement where necessary (also re-evaluate the RDA's).... </p>
<p>Maybe some these cases of bells palsy or guillain-barre syndrome related to the shot could have been avoided or having complications from any of other ubiquitous communicable viruses that have all magically gone dormant by just letting people get it - treating it properly and keeping society running.... but no Lord Faucci needs a new beach home - Lord Cuomo needs to sell a book  and if anyone questions their actions or the effectiveness of restricting their breathing they will be forever labeled a science denier or a racist or a bigot or any other new pejorative by armies of amoral keyboard warriors fighting a holy-war in the name of big money interests.  </p>

        <p>Not 0.1% but for ages 0-49 the case fatality rate maxes out at 0.32% so for the vast majority of the population it is less than 1% chance of fatality, obviously that changes in an individual basis depending upon your overall health.</p>
<p>https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/</p>
<p>Also with the Covid cases likely underreported, some estimates as high as 5X under reported, the fatality rate drops dramatically.</p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/02/06/964527835/why-the-pandemic-is-10-times-worse-than-you-think</p>
<p>If you take the confirmed Covid cases at multiply it by 5, and take the current number of deaths, the percentage is around 0.3%, coincidentally. Not that 0.3% is insignificant, if the entire US population got it, that is nearly a million people dead.</p>

<p>yes, just checked, and at a glance, it seems that there were 609 deaths reported from the COVID vaccine in the USA. Considering that there have been <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations">53 million vaccinated people</a>, this would mean that the correct data should be 0.001%, just a couple of orders of magnitude, no big deal</p>

        <p>Of course with vaccines, we rush to discredit any errors or deaths as being unrelated. Meanwhile, with COVID, someone dies in a motorcycle accident in a head on collision, and they are marked as a "COVID death" because it nets the hospital 25% extra billing.</p>

        <p>I guess this is a neat conspiracy theory for Americans but how comes that in Europe, where hospitals are publicly funded regardless of COVID patients, we still have plenty of people dying from COVID? Besides, any researcher would stand to benefit from showing an irrefutable link between COVID vaccines and adverse health effects, just look up  Dr. Andrew Wakefield - the quack who proposed the link between vaccination and autism - who still rides the wave of his lancet paper.</p>

        <p>It's not a conspiracy theory, it's a factual recounting of the 1.25 multiplier that is tacked on to all Medicare billing if the patient is listed as having a positive COVID-19 test result. It's not hidden or conspiratorial except in that it's not covered by the media, the government is open about the 1.25x multiplier.</p>
<p>Your post seems to imply that there  is no evidence of side effects from the vaccines. You don't actually believe that, do you? That's a stunning level of stupidity I can barely fathom. No medical professional would ever go so far as to claim there is no link between any vaccine and adverse health effects. The argument to be made is that the adverse health effects are worth it, because they don't happen to everyone, and the herd immunity will be so beneficial it will make up for it.</p>

        <p>Nobody says that there are no risks associated with vaccines, what everyone says is that the risks are neither of the kind nor of the severity that some people are afraid they are.</p>
<p>If you give a couple of aspirins to 50M people you are bound to find a few hundred patients who are allergic or with weird medical conditions that should not take it.</p>
<p>If you are a normal guy and are accepting to take a vaccine shot you are accepting a similar level of risk to that that we all take when we get on a car to go to work. Hardly anything to think twice about.</p>
<p>edit. Regarding that multiplier, my point still stands, we don't have any sort of multiplier that incentivizes people to be labeled as COVID-positive and we still have plenty of covid patients. I would not be surprised to hear about some bad actors but I hardly believe they are enough to skew the data</p>

        <p>Absolutely. The thought process born of experience with real data makes no sense at all when you substitute different data. The thought process involved in the decision to wear a seat belt is pretty stupid when you realise that seat belts save an average of 8 3 lives per year, but seat belt themselves actually kill 1076.2 people per year.</p>

        <p>Real numbers matter.  This is fake data, so it's mocking a fake thought process.  What is the point of that?  If we use real data, we would see the actual thought process.  No one would say that the vaccine killing.1% is a tiny irrelevant percentage.  What I am seeing from people on this sub is: "The vaccine is not safe! 0.001% of the people who received it died!" "If 1% of all the people who get Covid die, that's a tiny irrelevant percentage."</p>

        <p>How would covid cases OVERreported affect the numbers? Because according to Fauci himself, when the cycle rate of the PCR (which should NEVER have been used in the first place from the creator of the test) is above 35, there are false positives out the wazoo. He didn't use those words exactly but you get my drift. And that's not the only way cases have been incorrectly INFLATED.</p>

        <p>Honestly given how hard the media, governments, and corporations are trying to push the vaccine... I doubt we'll ever know the real percentage of people who die after receiving the vaccine.</p>
<p>I do know it killed Hammerin' Hank (the baseball player) and a bunch of nursing home residents, as well as that one doctor in his 50's.</p>

        <p>The Hank Aaron death was probably the most ironic gallows humor of the bunch.  His vaccination was widely publicized as a marketing campaign for the vaccine to minority (specifically black) communities.  "See?  Hammerin Hank's getting it, and he's a role model!  Be like Hank!"</p>
<p>Dead 2 weeks later.  Completely unrelated though I'm sure.  Now if he'd recovered from covid and died 2 weeks later... we all know how that works out.</p>

        <p>There's also years of life lost to think about.</p>
<p>Covid's average age of death is above life expectancy, thus years of life lost is quite low.</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware, side effects to the vaccine have no correlation to age and thus years of life lost per death to the vaccine is higher per death.</p>

        <p>It’s really hard to know because nothing has really been set up to record that data. VAERS is the only option and has flaws. It’s passive and voluntary. Doctors are supposed to report anything unusual that happens after vaccination but anecdotally I hear they often don’t. </p>
<p>A Harvard study done about 10 years about found that 1% of vaccine injury is reported. I don’t think it’s a totally relevant percentage anymore because people are so much more aware of this vaccine but still worth considering. </p>
<p>Anyway, this week the VAERS death count was over 600 and this is for America only (with a few exceptions of reports coming in from elsewhere).</p>

        <p>I had a conversation with a dommer not too long ago and it was pretty much this. </p>
<p>+ I find difficult to understand that people are not getting the vaccine because some died, people have traffic accident that's why I won't drive hahaha</p>
<p>- It goes both ways. Why would anyone be afraid of corona if some died, the survival rate is 99.2% or so, should we be afraid of the flu as well?</p>
<p>Then after he asked me if I was afraid of the vaccine I told him I wasn't but I thught taking it/forcing it unto others was idiotic because it was an experimental serum that (unlike the virus) was deadly.</p>
<p>The doomer replied with "isn't the virus deadly?!?!"
to which I replied with "if a survival rate of over 99% is deadly then yeah, it is deadly".</p>
<p>At this point he tried to dismiss everything with "even if this is true, if you are vaccinated you are protected against the virus spread"</p>
<p>At this point I just couldn't do anything but face palm. I don't know if he was being stupid or if that was the brainwashing in action but… even the government has said you still need to wear masks since the "vaccine" doesn't protect you from getting/spreading the virus, haven't they?</p>
<p>Also, I'm sorry if this is a bit weird to read at parts. He doesn't have a good command over the English language and I quoted him verbatim for context's sake.</p>

        <p>First: This virus is not controlled by humans, whereas cars are. We can do our best to stop the SPREAD of the virus by getting vaccinated. Of course, this is not going to be possible due to miscellaneous circumstances that cannot necessarily be blamed on anyone.</p>
<p>Second: Yes, we should be afraid of the flu, and we are afraid of the flu. That’s why during winter seasons prior to COVID, parents would always remind you to wash hands with soap, and tell you to put on extra layers while you shoveled the snow. Now obviously we won’t be able to “stop” the common cold, but we can and definitely should acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Third: Thinking that COVID can’t possibly cause death is just a straight-up delusion. There is a reason why vaccines were made. Even if it wasn’t deadly, no one wants a spread of a disease that causes severe discomfort to their daily lives, so a vaccine would still be required.</p>
<p>Fourth: COVID killed more Americans in one year than the flu did with nine seasons. Do you realize how much 1% means to a population of 328 million? If you can’t do math, it’s 3.28 million.</p>
<p>Fifth: If you are properly vaccinated with whatever vaccine you had selected, then you are relatively safe from getting COVID. There is still a good chance you can get COVID even after you get vaccinated, because vaccines don’t affect your body in two milliseconds.</p>
<p>Sixth: You need to wear masks after you get vaccinated because as I said previously, you still have a good chance of getting COVID right after you receive the vaccination. Also, especially during winter season, other viruses like the common cold can leave others immunocompromised, which would be able to kill them.</p>
<p>Stop being so delusional and manipulative for your own comfort and grow up.</p>

        <p>You are the first person I see being afraid of the flu, unironically  that is. Funny since you are the one calling others "delusional" and telling them to "grow up".</p>
<p>If the "vaccine" doesn't protect you against the virus in any way whatsoever then how is that supposed to stop the SpReAd? It's just stupid to believe it does anything at this point (other than cause health issues and kill those who shrugged off covid easily, respiratory problems or not).</p>
<p>Anything gets counted as covid, specially the untreated cancer and medical malpractice cases thanks to the stupid hype. Have you ever wondered how come nobody dies of cancer, heart attacks, etc anymore? Of course you haven't.</p>

<p>You have said a lot of nonsense, completely refusing to accept the "vaccines" (more like experimental mRNA serum) work even if you yourself have admitted they are completely useless to control infection. But no, the shit only comes out of my mouth apparently. If covid didn't kill you I'm pretty sure having some self awareness wouldn't kill you either.</p>
<p>No matter how much evidence we present or how much the government/cdc/who contradict themselves you will just bury your head in the sand (or into your own ass if it isn't really deep there already) and refuse anything that stops you from being scared so why bother.</p>

        <p>Actually, John Hopkins didn’t censor it. Here’s what actually happened.</p>
<p>“The Editors-in-Chief decided to delete the article because of these urgent concerns, explaining on social media that the piece was being taken out of context and used to spread dangerous misinformation. While the article noted the need for further research, this sentiment was not sufficiently emphasized. We failed to clarify that Briand’s analyses have not been published, peer-reviewed or verified by outside experts.”</p>
<p>“We also want to stress that we are an independent newspaper. Some mistook The News-Letter for an official University publication, while others accused Hopkins of censoring us. However, The News-Letter is an editorially and financially independent, student-run publication. The University does not control our content and did not influence our decision to retract the piece.”</p>

        <p>The genius thing about the vaccine is that it will have a delayed effect that won't show up immediately. Even a member of Joe Biden's Advisory Board on Covid-19, Michael Osterholm, understands the very real dangers of ADE/Pathogenic Priming that could happen after someone received the vaccine.</p>

        <p>The vaccine fatality rate is nowhere near 0.1%
There have been 173 million Covid vaccines administered worldwide and 53.8 million in the US and maybe a handful of deaths? </p>

        <p>All the hype.  All the marketing.  The daily death tolls across TV, newspapers and radio.  The PSA's.  The empty streets with only reporters on them.  The "coronavirus crisis."  The police arresting people on beaches, in parks, in their homes.  All of it has built up to the crescendo about to burst in Australia right now.  </p>
<p>The vaccine rollout is about to happen.  The coverage and lead up is unending.  Best money Pfizer ever spent.  It will be <strong>very</strong> interesting to see how any adverse reactions are publicised or scrutinised.<br>
As will be the slow realisation to everyone that it doesn't stop people from getting it, spreading it, needing to wear masks or social distance.  Curious to see how it's spun here.. as there never was much of a risk, so the vaccine could be sold as being 100% effective and any respiratory virus deaths get classified as anything but COVID-19.</p>

        <p>Doubt it, but we'll never know. I seem to see a lot of stories about people ending up really sick from the vaccine, getting the vaccine &amp; getting covid anyway. Elderly people dying from the fever of a vaccine. We'll never ever give the vaccine proper scrutiny though. I suspect if you counted every death within 28 days of a vaccine it'd be higher than .1% but that won't mean much, just like it doesn't for Covid.</p>

        <p>It would be 0.1% of 0.1%?</p>
<p>So that would be 328 people compared to 328200 who would die from COVID alone ignoring the people who would die from being unable to be treated.</p>

        <p>But it’s not 0.1% of people’s that die from the vaccine. It’s so so so so so so much lower than that. If there’s obvious allergies or problems associated with you taking a vaccine you will not have any major affects to your health. You can’t just make up a number then compare it to another number and say ‘look they are the same you are stupid’</p>

        <p>Everyone is vulnerable to Covid 19. Small things are co-morbidities, like being overweight (which like 70% of the population is) or being a smoker. Even if you don’t <em>die</em> from Covid, there are long-lasting consequences to getting it, like permanent heart and lung damage or trying to deal with a massive bill after you’ve been hospitalized. </p>
<p>There should have been wayyy more govt assistance, and a quicker and more focused approach to controlling it would have been significantly more effective at dealing with it instead of dragging it out like this. And yes, there have been a lot of hardships because of the shut downs and limitations. But that’s what happens when there are disease outbreaks. Do you think it was all fun and games when shit like the bubonic plague, small pox, and polio were terrorizing the human race? It’s unfortunate, but you have to pick your poison. I’d personally rather be healthy and broke than damaged and financially stable. Health is not something you can put a pricetag on.</p>
<p>The vaccine is safe for the vast majority of individuals, and before it is administered, they will ask you if you have any sort of known allergies. They watch you for a period of time afterwards to make sure you’re not having a bad reaction to it before letting you leave, as well. There are medical professionals on standby to care for you if you exhibit signs of a reaction. Not everyone needs to get it, but those who <em>can</em> get the vaccine need to, for the sake of protecting those who <em>can’t</em> get it.</p>

        <p>you really believe in that nonsense about long-term complications after getting COVID? Is there any proposed mechanism of action that explains how your body became so incapable of healing itself all of a sudden, that somehow it magically experiences effects that are radically contrary to the effects of every other disease? You're telling me it can literally heal itself from being physically injured and being poisoned, but it can't recover from COVID? Or, conversely, are you sure there isn't, like, some political agenda, maybe any agenda of any kind, explaining why someone would be in such a hurry to publish studies, or promote studies, linking more worrisome symptoms to COVID? Are you sure there isn't some other possible explanation, any explanation at all, for why we see these long term studies, when the results of the studies are contrary to the effects of every other disease, and the long span of time required to study long-term effects literally hasn't even passed yet?</p>
<p>this shit is so ridiculous. I work in a nursing home. I've seen so many people in their 80s and 90s get COVID infected with literally no downside at all. They don't give a shit, it's so utterly meaningless. I have no idea what is wrong with you guys.</p>

        <p>Viruses have mRNA that they inject into your cells’ nuclei. When the cells divide and reproduce, they reproduce the viral RNA, which tells the cell to construct more viral structures. The viral structures then destroy the cell and go on to infect and destroy other cells. Some viruses reproduce and destroy cells more rapidly than others. </p>
<p>The body’s defense to this is the immune system, but the immune systems runs kind of on a trial and error system, to water it down an awful lot. When it encounters new threats, it has to develop specific immune cells to fight them off. The more similar the new threats are to previous threats that you’ve developed immunity to, the faster the body figures out how to defend against it. Typically when new viruses emerge, they are only slightly different mutations of the viruses your body has already encountered, and so they make you sick, but aren’t usually deadly. </p>
<p>Covid 19 is a virus that was brand new to like, the entire human population. Nobody’s body had dealt with it before. It’s particularly and aggressively harmful to the respiratory system, and IIRC, fights back against the immune system. It’s not that our bodies’ immune systems suddenly “don’t work,” it’s just that Covid is especially difficult for them to recognize and deal with. I don’t know how or why it suddenly emerged (I have suspicions that certain governments with overpopulation issues manufactured and released it, but of course I have no proof of that). I just know what the epidemiology and virology experts tell us, and that’s that this shit is serious and has long term consequences, and that if we take certain precautions, we can mitigate those consequences. </p>
<p>There are plenty of severe diseases that were new once that we now vaccinate for and don’t have to deal with any longer. We should be grateful for that. People are just so comfortable and spoiled now and never had to live through epidemics and pandemics before, and so it seems like this huuuuuge, unjust disruption to their lives. The reality is, the human species will conquer and recover. We always do. It’s just about damage control right now (and there is significant disagreement about what the damage control should entail.)</p>

        <p>I don't disagree with what you're saying, for the most part. However, novel virus or not, the functionality of a person's body being fundamentally altered, to the extent that it cannot recuperate from non life-threatening injury well after its initial condition of infection has already long since passed, is an extremely atypical and a highly implausible occurrence -- certainly less plausible than sensationalized studies being used to confirm desired outcomes alongside ulterior political agendas. Maybe we could clear this up if there were at least a proposed mechanism of action to explain how the infection could manage to produce this very strange result. Is there one?</p>

        <p>We are not invincible. Unlike certain other species of animals, we can’t regrow most of our limbs or organs. Theres a limit to how much we can recover from; for instance, you can accidentally cut off a tiny piece of flesh from the tip of your finger, and it will grow back (usually with scarring), but if you cut off a whole finger, that finger is gone. You can survive damage to your liver from alcohol or treated hepatitis, but if you’re an alcoholic for years or you don’t get treatment in time for hep, you can die of liver failure.That’s why people need things like kidney donations or cornea transplants. </p>
<p>If the tissue of your heart and lungs gets too badly damaged or scarred up, they can’t function properly. That goes for any injury, unhealthy habit, or attack from viruses. </p>
<p>I would much rather stay away from the public gym for a year or two than develop a permanent heart or lung condition that impacts my ability to exercise forever.</p>

        <p>There have been no significant studies on who will or will not get a serious vaccine reaction. And why should there be?

        <p>The studies are ongoing, and findings are published as often as the collected data is analyzed. For example, i got the first dose and I do a “daily health check,” which is a survey about what I’m experiencing, and that gets sent back to the CDC. It’s pretty neat. (The only symptoms I had were pain in the should from having a needle stuck in it, a little bit of fatigue the day of, and a headache that lasted about 30 minutes after receiving it. And the fatigue may just have been a symptom of pregnancy.) I just hope most people who get vaccinated choose to participate as well, because the more people who volunteer the data, the more accurate of a picture statisticians can paint for us about the vaccine effects. </p>
<p>So far, they have found that those with other allergies or a history of reactions are more likely to have a reaction to the covid vaccine. (Go figure.) The CDC estimated about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm?s_cid=mm7002e1_w">1 in 90,000</a> will experience anaphylaxis back in January. Again, they have medical professionals on vaccination sites to deal with potential reactions. They don’t stick you and shove you out the door with a “good luck; hope you don’t die!” And they will not give you the second dose if you’ve had a bad reaction to the first one, obviously.</p>

        <p>The problem most people have (lurkers) is that the vaccine is a trial. People who were healthy before the lockdowns have nearly zero risk of death or complications from covid, but are being pressured to take an experimental vaccine with very little testing and ZERO liability if anything goes wrong.</p>

        <p>People who were healthy before the lockdowns react differently to the virus, and like I said, the stats show that very common conditions/habits are comorbidities. We don't know the long term effects of this disease yet, but so far what we're seeing is that some are permanently affected. That is a risk I am not willing to take.</p>
<p>Do you really think the government would spend billions of dollars on vaccines that aren't effect and safe, again, for the vast majority of the population? The administrators of the vaccine take many precautions against negative reactions, as I listed before. The liability falls on the local government issuing the vaccines (in my case, it would be my county.)</p>

        <p>Ah yes, that well-known corporate conglomerate left-wing MSM website, The Jerusalem Post. </p>
<p>Current numbers for vaccines administered is ~37 million. Current number of people who have died for ANY reason post-vaccine is ~350. That means EVEN IF literally all of those deaths were complications from the vaccine (which they weren't), the vaccine's death rate percent would be .00094%, or roughly 1 in 100000.</p>

<p>I never argued the math with you. I'm sure it's less than .1% (for now).</p>
<p>The vaccine is unlikely to kill many people within a short time period of the "vaccination".</p>
<p>The issue is auto immune and ADE stuff months to years from now...</p>

        <p>You want to play numbers? </p>
<p>The worldwide covid cases are underestmated, we don't know by how much, but assume it's x5 - x10. 
Why? Case identification is done by testing. If governments test more, there are more cases. If they test less, the numbers drop. What a coincidence... </p>
<p>The worldwide covid deaths are overestimated; almost every death counts as COVID. Suddenly, when you die of COVID, old age doesn't matter anymore. With the vaccine, it's the other way around. Everyone can play with statistics, so don't tell me the scientists don't do it. </p>
<p>We'll take the conservative route. If cases are x5 underestimated, we have 400M (rounded down) worldwide cases, of which 2,412,950 deaths. Oh no, the death rate is now 0.6%. </p>
<p>Is this really so difficult to grasp?</p>

        <p>For asking about playing numbers, you use used very few numbers in your response. </p>
<p>&rt;If governments test more, there are more cases. If they test less, the numbers drop</p>
<p>Duh, but real analysis isn't looking at total new cases, but rather percentage of tests than come back positive (which naturally normalizes this statistic to a metric). Your 5-10x more actual cases is arbitrary and irrelevant. </p>
<p>It seems like coincidence that you not only feel cases are UNDER counted, but that DEATHS are overcounted. How convenient. You use a 5x factored up cases total and compare that to confirmed death total. Convenient as well. </p>
<p>Play numbers by starting at looking at excess deaths from the CDC, first.</p>

        <p>Is 2.4 million people a tiny and irrelevant number? Because that’s how many people have died worldwide. If their preferred “new normal” is the banal acceptance of millions of deaths which could have easily been saved with vaccines, then I don’t want it either. If the “new normal” means that there is a highly improved chance that me and my loved ones can become protected from COVID-19, then I’ll take it over this nightmare any day.</p>

        <p>Also, just out of curiosity, what is an acceptable death toll for you? And even for those that survive, how much permanent damage to their health is cool?

        <p>5,000 people died from choking last year. Banning solid foods would unquestionably save thousands of lives every year. Is 5,000 an acceptable death toll for you? Are all those deaths worth it just so you selfishly don’t have to purée all your food?</p>
<p>Most people would see that as a silly argument and pay it no mind. It’s not a matter of deaths being “worth” any activity we routinely perform—death and disease are, and always have been, extremely commonplace. No one can ultimately dodge death. We simply make trade-offs here and there to push it as far back as we can. Having a healthy diet is a trade-off many people make. Others are more comfortable eating less healthily in exchange for a potentially shorter life. It all depends on a person’s preferences and risk-tolerance.</p>
<p>Going out in public is another value proposition. For the vast majority of people, the chance of catching an infectious disease is an acceptable risk. Just like with any other health risk, people weigh the risks and make decisions accordingly. No one here is making any claims about how risk-tolerant any individual should be. We simply don’t think the government should have any place to make those decisions for anyone. For most people here, this isn’t an issue of morals or caring. It’s an issue of human rights and autonomy.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, but have you considered that the rampant and unchecked spread of this virus may have a considerably more dire impact on society? Perhaps some of these temporary measures may in fact be saving us from this “fundamental alteration of society” which you seem to be so afraid of.</p>

        <p>I have considered that, and given what we know about the virus and about all the side effects of the measures to mitigate it I think the latter will have a more dire impact on society. I think that children missing out on socialization/education, steep increases in depression/suicide (especially among young people), more domestic abuse, less outlets for people to leave the house and interact, less gym-going and exercise, less preventive healthcare, growing food shortages and a host of other side effects in aggregate pose a much more dire threat than this virus ever could.</p>
<p>For anyone who supports all the mitigation measures we’re seeing around the globe, I’d assume they believe the trade-offs to be worth whatever marginal virus-mitigation gains that result. For me and most people on this sub, we don’t see it as a worthwhile trade-off whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Is your argument that they could have had the chance to die from something else so it doesn’t fucking matter? Or is it that people who are 80+ do not deserve our consideration? Maybe less people have died from the flu this year because the safety protocols involved in reducing the spread of COVID work for other easily transmissible illnesses as well. I get that life may seem dull sometimes, but trying to spice it up by convincing yourself you are part of some grandiose conspiracy to turn you into a sheep/man hybrid by the global elite by asking you to wear a mask and stay home when you can, or whatever the fuck it is you think is happening, isn’t going to help anything. All of this selfish bullshit is only prolonging the lockdowns and mask mandates you seem to hate so vehemently.</p>

<p>My behavior is not selfish. I wear a mask as it's mandated everywhere I go, inside and outside, even in an empty street. If you don't, you get fined. Calling this ridiculous rule out is not selfish behavior.</p>
