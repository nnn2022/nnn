    <strong>Do you really believe all of vaccinated people will go through terrible and government will get away with it?</strong>
    <p><p>You guys don't support covid vaccines, alright it's your freedom of choice but I'm just curious since you don't want to take it you probably think it's dangerous right?</p>
<p>So we have to do simple math and a little bit of logic.</p>
<p>Let's say all of vaccinated people get something bad because of vaccination do you believe government can just get away with it? People won't stand up? I don't think that's possible at all if something bad happens to mass of people there will be alot of chaos it's literally impossible for government to avoid it.</p>
<p>But I don't think everyone believes <em>all of</em> vaccinated people will go through some shit does some of you believe 5% or 10% or whatever will experience something bad?</p>
<p>Or maybe you believe there will be long term damage?</p>
<p>What do you actually believe in, what's going to happend? Do you have some proofs for it or you just don't believe anyone, I get it it's hard to believe in everything government says but this thing is huge how can you think theres something behind it if it's so BIG? I just want to hear your opinions even if you don't have proofs I want to see what you guys think of this situation and why.</p></p>

<p>Hundreds of children are haviglng heart attacks and most of the parents are twitter signalling with "I'd do it again".</p>
<p>So yeah, people won't do shit, and yeah, the government will get away with it - they always do.</p>
<p>We don't think EVERYONE who has had the vaccine will be harmed, but a sizeable proportion will.</p>
<p>And fuck off with your patronising "let's use a little bit of logic" </p>
<p>This has gone from 15 days to flatten the curve to knocking on doors and prison sentences for not having an UNAPPROVED medicine.</p>
<p>And few people are standing up to it.</p>
<p>There's your simple math.</p>

        <p>Oh fuck off with the "sources" BS even Psaki admitted they are blocking "disinformation" aka shit they don't want the public to see.</p>
<p>Use google - it is easy to find myocarditis as a side effect that has now been added to the official list.</p>
<p>Not that it matters.</p>
<p>Side effect lists are to inform the patient, but as it is coerced or you get fired, you have no real choice anyway.</p>
<p>I'm not being rude - you are.</p>
<p>You are claiming all we need to do is use simple math and a little logic to prove us wrong.</p>
<p>Need waaaay more than that. </p>
<p>We were laughed at on NNN when we said it would be more than 2 weeks.</p>
<p>We were laughed at when we said mask mandates would be everywhere.</p>
<p>We were laughed at when we said lockdowns will be seasonally repeated.</p>
<p>We were laughed at when we said vaccine mandates would arrive - and they now are in Europe.</p>
<p>All our predictions have come true.</p>
<p>Demonstrable predictive capability is much more useful than any logic.</p>
<p>Logic can get you anywhere. Logic is simply consistency, not truth.</p>
<p>All ducks are orange, sammy is a duck. Sammy is orange.</p>
<p>All logic. Issue? Ducks aren't orange.</p>
<p>If you make an assumption and then use logic to extend it, it all falls to pieces if that assumption is false.</p>
<p>It's the ladder rung fallacy.</p>

        <p>Lol even my grandma can make up shit on internet even if she believes it's true if there's no proof she's the only one that can believe in it.</p>
<p>Why do you guys hate word "sources" so much, because you don't have it? Be honest please.</p>
<p>Also I can see yall love to say something like goverment hides it! When someone asks for source. Or Google it yourself!</p>
<p>I know you don't like it but it's true that's what you guys say, downvote me as much as you want but you are delusional if you deny that as true.</p>
<p>If you don't have source, it's not a proof it's an opinion.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why do you think it isn't an experiment</p>
<p>Because there's no actual proof it is, whole thing is pretty big and I don't think government is organized well enough to do this lol.</p>
<p>Also I don't see any benefits of it.</p>
<p>At the end of text I asked for opinions of EVERYONE that don't want a vaccine even if they don't have a proof I want to hear them.</p>

        <p>Releasing an unapproved injection for emergency use when the track record of the type of serum being administered (mRNA) is decidedly mixed then advocating for economic and social coercion for people to participate seems consistent with an intent to herd the population into what amounts to large scale human trials.</p>
<p>Sometimes this can work and sometimes it backfires- depending on what's being administered.  I do not fully discount the possibility that the government's intentions are on the up-and-up but there are so many things that haven't "smelled right" over the past year and a half and so many questionable actions leaves me deeply distrustful of the folks in charge.</p>
<p>Yes, there is not "actual proof" that this is an experiment and there's also no "actual proof" that it isn't- and a lot of context has me leaning toward "is".</p>

        <p>Why do you assume that everyone here thinks the same way though- I’m not taking it because I don’t trust the government... some people don’t want to deal with adverse side effects... some people realize that the sooner we put our foot down the sooner this bullshit ends.
I don’t really care about the <em>why</em>. I’m just glad that other people won’t take it- even if it’s not for the same reason as me.
Regardless of what it is- if the government wants you to do something that is very obviously not safe, there’s ulterior motivation there. If they weren’t forcing propaganda down our throats, sending people to knock our doors and threatening to ruin our lives: I would have already taken the shots.</p>

<p>Yes you do.. at least to an extent</p>
<p>&rt;You guys don't support covid vaccines</p>
<p>Until these are proven safe and effective they do not qualify as vaccines.  They are unapproved experimental injections administered under emergency provisions ostensibly to confront and deal with an extraordinarily serious global health emergency.</p>

        <p>Mate, if you wanted to kill off a percentage of the population, or better put control it, you want a mandatory ongoing vaccine program where population can be reduced at a rate that suits you the conspirator by altering the percentage of killer vials you give out. Don’t assume all vials are the same.</p>
<p>This against a backdrop of a “virus” that is “getting worse” for people due to antibody dependant enhancement, they can say it was a mistake but now we are too vaccinated to stop, new vaccines will have to be given out periodically as your broad innate immunity is “overwritten” due to low affinity, this explains why they need to get the vast majority on board before this winter, so they’re trapped in it, at the same time a global ID system will need to be developed, printed on the skin or underneath the skin, so we know where we’re at with everyone, economies collapse, bring one world digital currency in, hardly any jobs, bring in universal basic income, before you know it we’re all connected to a hive mind 24/7 control system instructed via AI.</p>

        <p>Not all people want to hear this due to their beliefs, and I respect that I’m not here to preach or anything, but What you said about a global ID system, one world currency, and even 1 world government has a connection to apocalyptic prophecy in the bible, and I just want to mention it (as I find it interesting and very possible).</p>
<p>It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.</p>
<p>We are already seeing mandatory vaccination and vaccine passports. Could this mark of the beast be connected in some way? Could the vaccines be a gateway to a global Id system? Could this introduce a one world currency? I don’t know, and I’m not going to guess and assume any further. With time we will see what crazy world we are going to live in.</p>
<p>For one world government, it’s sort of hard to understand the verse, but pretty much it says everyone will subject themselves to a single ruler, after the 10 entities power is destroyed or reduced to figureheads. There are Many theories on this, but the most likely is disasters and plagues (also described in revelation 6-11) I mean if you look around, you can see people are so scared, they embrace anyone who “promises” to give them relief. This is all just speculation, and could have no connection whatsoever, I just find it interesting that a book in the Bible about prophesying the future seems to have some references to what is happening now. </p>
<p>Btw I did use a source for this if you would like a read yourself </p>

        <p>I’ve never heard of david icke’s philosophy, but to answer for all other religions:</p>
<p>This is a bit of a tough one imo. I can’t see into the past, but what I believe is that there is a gracious, loving god. Now I don’t know if you have heard of the trinity, so I’ll explain. It’s pretty much this:
God the father 
Gods son Jesus 
The Holy Spirit 
This is where it gets confusing, they are all 1. Jesus is god, and god is the Holy Spirit, and so on.</p>
<p>What makes Christianity different?</p>
<p>Christianity is someone who is a follower of Jesus Christ, son of god. follow Christ by embodying the beliefs of the Christian faith by believing in Jesus's life, death, and resurrection, and also by using that faith to be disciples of Christ. Usually, Catholics believe this as well, but there are different things the Catholic Church does that I don’t believe in, but I’m not going to shame them for it, I’m just saying what I believe is wrong. Catholics believe the teachings of Christ, just like Christians, but they believe that the church is the path to heaven, and that the pope has very high authority. Also, their way of getting into heaven is different. If I’m right, they try to in a way “impress” god (feel free to correct if any Catholics are reading this because I don’t know much about being Catholic). Being Christianity is not about pleasing god, it’s about having a relationship with him. Religion is in a way man-made, but Christianity is god made. Christianity closely follows the Bible. It seems most religions come back to god, but they just believe different things, but some the same. I don’t know if you are a follower of Christ or what religion you believe in, but I can’t make that choice for you. As I said before, Christianity is a relationship with god. In times or trouble, we can talk to him by praying, because of Jesus who died for all sins and overcame death. At this point, god is real. I’ve seen him work in my life, and others lives. Crazy things have happened in our family that just proves how there can’t not be god. Here is my favourite verse:</p>
<p>Proverbs 3:5-6</p>
<p>“Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.”

        <p>Mate, you’re so similar to Icke, and yes I’d definitely follow the bible as born again rather than the institution, popes audience hall says it all, all I’d say is that Icke takes it further as to what god is and that love of god and following Jesus Christ has been corrupted by TPTB.

        <p>&rt; I don't think that's possible at all if something bad happens to mass of people there will be alot of chaos it's literally impossible for government to avoid it.</p>
<p>We literally destroyed all western nations future over the coof, so meh, wouldn't be so sure. I see no rioting in the streets with 20 years old that demand their futures back.</p>
<p>They can have the mentally challenged masses believe whatever they want. Remember, this is what they're telling you. <em>They're</em> saying that, not me:</p>
<ul>
<li>My vaccine protects me</li>
<li>But only if you get it too</li>
<li>Even if it doesn't protect from contagion, it only lessers symptoms</li>
<li>But it's the unvaccinated ones that create the variants</li>
<li>Oh by the way natural immunity does no longer exist</li>
<li>Oh by the way if you die or are permanently fucked up by this shit you can't sue us</li>
<li>The virus' IFR is 0.1%, about 0.01% in the healthy population, it gets to sub 0.005% for young and healthy  people </li>
<li>(Europe) about 80% of the at risk has two doses now, about 90% has one</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet you will soon need two doses if you're a 20 years old that wants to sit down at a restaurant in France - the rest of Europe will follow. So yeah, there's no limit to what they can pull off and get away with. We just have to wait and see what happens. Maybe it's just the gateway to implement China style social control with social credit scores and good boy passes to do everything that's fun, who knows. Only thing I'm certain of is that no matter what they push there will be no pushback.</p>

        <p>They are promoting vaccines and I don't see any lies too, so that's fine with me why do you think this can lead to something bigger like Chinese control? You are pretty much free even if you aren't vaccinated beside few countries that are trying to push too hard, but it's not true you can't sit in a restaurant if you aren't vaccinated in any country in the world.</p>

<p>They're not lying. That's the weird thing. They're just saying things on TV, and then they're saying other things that <em>directly contradict</em> what they say on TV, on their own sites, just in a language that most of the public doesn't understand.</p>
<p>&rt; You are pretty much free even if you aren't vaccinated beside few countries that are trying to push too hard, but it's not true you can't sit in a restaurant if you aren't vaccinated in any country in the world.</p>
<p>Give it 2 weeks? It's the 1 of August in France, Italy is planning the same, UK has "leaked" that vaccine passports are to be implemented in the fall.</p>

        <p>I believe that medicine is something to not be taking lightly, the vaccines out there are untested and they're using people as testing subjects without knowing what effects they would have. Do I believe everyone will die? No, do I think the vaccine will turn us into mutants? No.</p>
<p>It's just untested medicine being used widespread because of the absolute greed of farmaceutical companies and governments being either accomplices or just being held hostages by the fear they helped spread.</p>
<p>There's no way to know what lasting effects vaccines would have because there was no testing, at least no real tests, because those takes years.</p>
<p>And no, the people won't stand up, if anything this shit show served the purpose to demonstrate that people are weak and scared and governments can do absolutely whatever they want and the few dissidents will be shut down by their peers.</p>
<p>And let's say in the very improbable situation in which a shit ton of the population develops some form of health issue in one year or two, who would be able to prove its linked to the vaccine? So yeah, taking untested medicine is not something I'm keen on doing, it doesn't matter if the government, the media and a bunch of stupid people are telling me I'm wrong, I'll stay the way I am because covid to me is not this big menace the media created, it's a normal disease with a incredible low death rate and I rather take my chances with it (even though I have Bronchitis)  than with a untested substance that may prove to be way worse.</p>
