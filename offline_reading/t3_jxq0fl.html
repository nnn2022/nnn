        <p>On <strong>20 November</strong> 2020, <em>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> published <em>Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses</em>, <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5/epdf/abstract">(Jefferson et al., 2020)</a>. The review noted: 
&rt;Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes <strong>no difference</strong> in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort. N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.</p>
