    <strong>Only way the ‘Sheep’ will wake up.</strong>
    <p><p>‘All people care about is their <strong>sense of freedom</strong>, not their actual freedom.’</p>
<p>For example, most people don’t care the govt are spying on you, collecting your data, because they have a sense of freedom: They can still call, text, use the internet, so whats the problem? </p>
<p>Apply this to the current situation: Yeah there’s restrictions but the sheep still have a sense of freedom. You can watch TV, work from home, get groceries, play video games, watch sports, etc so whats the problem?</p>
<p>My theory is, the sheep won’t wake up until the climate lockdowns. Most of these people have never questioned the universe, looked deeply inwards or had any sort of spiritual experience. </p>
<p>Instead they are of the consumeristic mindset which the climate lockdowns &amp; the ‘you will own nothing and be happy’ agenda will destroy. They won’t be able to buy a shiny new toy or binge through 8 hours of game of thrones because they’ve used up their electricity limit for the day. Their <strong>sense of freedom</strong> will be gone.</p>
<p>Or this is just me being hopeful and the propaganda by then will be so strong they will actually be happy.</p></p>
