    <strong>Still have antibodies after 5 months</strong>
    <p><p>I got the vid back in March, basic flu like symptoms. Couldn’t get tested because I’m not high risk. I started donating blood earlier this year and my donation center started testing for antibodies shortly after all this crap got big.  I tested positive back in June and Just got my results in for my donation August 6 and I still have antibodies.  Don’t let them drive the narrative. Go donate blood, it’s awesome to help out someone that needs blood, plus you can see if you have the antibodies. The more people that find out they had antibodies will help to spread the word that it’s way more prevalent than they think and therefore not as dangerous. 
Peace and love</p></p>

        <p>The problem is that a lot of states record positive antibody results as general positive COVID cases, and use that to determine their draconian measures. It's scuzzy, but yeah.</p>

        <p>Can I get some evidence of that?  </p>
<p>I got tested on Friday and I'm extremely likely to be negative.  I planned to get an antibody test to aggravate the hell out of anyone who would claim I can give people CV (if it's positive).</p>

        <p>I can't remember the links to specific articles, but it's been said many times here and at LDS. The governors of states like NY, NJ, PA, CA, etc (the usual suspects) are coupling up the COVID positive cases from the nose tests, with the antibody blood test results. Yes, antibodies are different. But they are using the positive antibody tests as well, to stuff their numbers up further.</p>

        <p>Goddamn.  The donation company here wasn't testing when I donated a few months back, not sure if they changed that.  Antibody tests are super hard to get in my state - the government basically just denounced them and everyone accepted blindly.  I asked my PCP for one, and he informed me:</p>
<p>1) antibody tests only detect antibodies for 30 days, because</p>
<p>2) you can get re-infected after said 30 day threshold, and</p>
<p>3) antibody tests are only for people who had a previous positive PCR.</p>
<p>Then they cancelled my annual check-up, again.</p>
<p>Shopping for a new PCP, seems to be slim pickings in these parts.  I was blown away by the bullshit he fed me.</p>

        <p>idk but you should be able to order private antibody test pretty cheaply. I paid $25 equivalent for antibody test in May in Poland.</p>
