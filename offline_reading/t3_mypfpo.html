    <strong>How did you ‚Äúwake up‚Äù to all of this stuff?</strong>
    <p><p>Most people buy into the extreme brainwashing of our governments to get this experimental vaccine, stop the entire economy and society, abide by extreme social distancing and quarantine rules, wear masks 8-10 hours a day, and to be scared out of their minds by Covid. </p>
<p>A few people seem to be aware of how bulls**t this all is, but they are in the minority.</p>
<p>So, how did you wake up to become aware of the truth of all this stuff? Did you have a bad experience with medical establishment / vaccines in the past? Someone you know died from the Covid shot? Intuition? Researching it? </p>
<p>Everyone has a different story of awakening to this crap, and I‚Äôm curious what yours is. üåÖ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p></p>

        <p>I grew up in a cult-like religion that I started questioning at 12-13. Stopped listening to politicians when Bush the Sequel was selected. Haven‚Äôt had cable nor watched the news since 2007-ish after political disillusionment and learning about NLP. My stomach turns listening to blatant propaganda if I‚Äôm stuck somewhere with a TV blaring. </p>
<p>On March 13th 2020, I was sent home to start remote work. I stopped into Walgreens and joked with the cashier about why everyone was buying toilet paper. Toilet paper? Madness. Over the following weeks, I listened to everyone go on and on about it, so I started reading. My top skill is research (and analysis). Nothing made sense. Still doesn‚Äôt. </p>
<p>And yes, 3 big, bad medical issues/mistakes throughout my life caused me to stop automatically trusting doctors over a decade ago... this was solidified when reading my chart for the first time last year and seeing all the ‚Äúpatient did not take medication as prescribed‚Äù (as if shocked I ignored the drug-pusher‚Äôs pitch). Long conversations with close friends/ex-pharmaceutical sales reps also opened my eyes to a lot. Add that to my disgust with higher ed and big tech after spending the majority of my career in those fields. </p>
<p>And alas, you‚Äôve got a person with little to no trust in the institutions so many hold dear. </p>
<p>‚Äî Oh, and Tupac, George Carlin, and Bob Marley deserve a mention here... their words contributed to my thought process, for sure. They would have never stood for all this bs and I‚Äôm blessed with the same courageous spirit even though I‚Äôm a chick. ;)</p>

        <p>I also exited a religious cult after decades in it. The process unplugged me forever. I now understand why the masses chase social inclusion and why the handful of otherwise intelligent people abandon thought and reason to cling to social acceptance, tribalism and culture over facts.</p>

        <p>Saw loose change years ago.  Fucken broke my worldview.  Once you accept buildings just don't fall into their footprints at freefall speed, it leads you down some pretty dark rabbit holes.  But hey, there is something positive about knowing how fucked up and sick  our world is; I'm not getting the vaccine, and neither is anybody close to me because i've opened their eyes as well.  I could have saved at least the lives of those I care about.</p>

        <p>In Feb of 2020 I was pretty concerned.  I was taken in by all the supposedly leaked videos from China.  (Which I now believe were well planned propaganda.)  I urged my coworkers to prepare for shortages and potential 2-week quarantines.</p>
<p>By May, I was pretty over it.   I'm a data person so looking at the data from our state dept of health told me this wasn't a big deal.   I also did a lot of research on how PCR tests worked and what they were testing for.</p>
<p>Since then, things have gotten more and more restrictive with the media going nuts over the slightest 'bad' news, and never celebrating any 'good' news.</p>
<p>I've had tons of vaccinations.  (Former military.)   I think many newer vaccines are laced with a junk I don't want in my body.  The mRNA shots are not vaccines and concern me greatly.  Based on how they work, I would expect long term auto-immunity problems.</p>
<p>I know a few people who've had injections and seem relatively ok with mild reactions.</p>
<p>I've since done more research and realize that the mask/lockdown/vaccine show is just the beginning of what they have in store for us.</p>

        <p>What is scary to me is how my friends,, family, neighbors, and co-workers will likely support the tyranny that will want to imprison me for refusing the shot. I am being turned into a threat to society for not complying with this madness. I see this leading to a dystopian nightmare, one that will be enforced by the very people closest to us.</p>

        <p>I have no idea.  They told us to walk down a hallway and a bunch of corpsmen lined up along the sides injected us in both arms.   Then some guy yelled at us to get our shirts back on and we ran back outside.</p>

        <p>True. üëçüëç
I have known governments lie to people but for some reason had a hard time believing that these lies would include academic institutions, medical establishments, scientists, and doctors.
They have brainwashed people well.</p>

        <p>No brainwashing. Follow the money. There have been those in the medical and scientific community that have refuted what is pushed. They often aren‚Äôt covered by the media which, as we have learned in the last 20 years, has an agenda of their own. Always follow the money.</p>

        <p>When I heard that the German TV-channel "ZDF" took down a video of their own interview with "Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg" I became suspicious and looked up who he is and what he said.</p>
<p>I think this is as long ago as march of last year. Just looked it up, it was broadcast on march 10th and deleted roughly 10 days later.</p>
<p>Opinions being censored rather than addressed, was a big red flag to me.</p>
<p>So yeah, around march 20th 2020 was when I stopped believing the official narrative.</p>

        <p>I woke up to the mental prison in 2012 after a big mushroom trip. I was going to go into the military after high school but, after doing some research, I found IVAW which opened my eyes to the reality of the wars we were/are involved in. From there the rabbit hole spiraled. I knew from the begining what covid was...more lies for more control.</p>

        <p>Well, this could be war and peace... I'll try and keep it brief.</p>
<p>So for me, it's a culmination, a progression from the last twelve years or so.</p>
<p>Way back, when I had drank the cool-aid fully so to speak, was in the military - all for Iraq, and saw/experienced some things which basically jolted me out of the narrative I'd become identified with. (My own desire to be the good guy, to help/be a hero/make a difference - making me particularly susceptible to the waffle).</p>
<p>Coming to see the lies around Iraq, studying history, and while yes over the years hearing about various conspiracies... Wanting to do my due diligence and make up my own mind.</p>
<p>Over the years, the patterns of behaviour around foreign policy, that transcended individual adminstrations became undeniable. I.e. a pretty good sense of what might be described as the deep state or establishment.</p>
<p>And for a long time, the corruption I saw through government and large multi national corps, banking, lobbying etc... I put down to system thinking i.e
 A defective system creates defective behaviour.</p>
<p>These last year's... With all the data points and stimuli - it's simply become impossible to call such phenomena anything other than by design, and I had to let go of it being an unfortunate accident/outcome.</p>
<p>Also in my own personal work, spiritual journey... I've done a huge amount of stuff around reconnecting to intuition, trust on life, spirit and so on... (A lot of solo work in nature, interpersonal practices, meditation, therapy etc..)</p>
<p>I've come, with practice to trust in intuition first, knowing all to well how easily the mind can be tricked - bodily wisdom and knowing not so much (at all).</p>
<p>When covid hit, besides observing all the usual tells that something was up (all media singing off same songsheet, censorship of divergent opinions, politicians <em>agreeing</em>, a hero class, an "enemy", key phrases repeated ad nausea etc..) I just felt it... Something was off, very much so.</p>
<p>As I've observed the shifting goalposts and the gradual boiling of the frog, along with many other things. It has been confirmed again and again.</p>
<p>Intuition folks, it's ones best friend.</p>

        <p>I started to wake up to the climate change scam years ago. Nothing they predicted was happening, so I began to dig into why. Discovered the data was all made up bullshit and it was a scam made up to destroy the economies of western societies. It was clear where they were going with it. When Covid came along, and Trudeau was caught saying the quiet part out loud, I knew they were going to use it to accelerate their plan of destroying the country. Then the plan was leaked in October, and following along, it is clear as day what is going on here. The same fake computer models they used for climate change were used to drive fear into us for Covid. Then, a year later, again none of the predictions materialized.</p>

        <p>"The masks don't work!! Stop wearing masks!!" turned into mask mandates worldwide. You can't stop a virus like that so I was DONE. Then I find out why we never had coronavirus vaccines (ADE mostly) and I got nervous about the push to quickly mass produce them.</p>

        <p>The crazy level of lockdowns we had, &amp; then it was not only accepted but encouraged for BLM riots. </p>
<p>Then that wasn't a "superspreader" but Spring Break was.... </p>
<p>Then the obviously false advice from CDC, that suddenly went 180 from previous CDC guidelines on health. The 'sanitizing', the home-made 'masks', the recommendations no one be inside, but being out in the cold rain was 'healthy'... "Outdoor dining" in unventilated, damp tents.</p>

        <p>about 7 years ago when i watched (on youtube) a uni lecture of some prof on the financial system - with focus on the historic topic "gold backed dollar"</p>
<p>before watching i thought the topic of finance/economy is fkin lame. but i thought "its important. maybe i should learn the basics at least. i am becoming an adult now"</p>
<p>this lecture opened my eyes for sure. had to listen to this several times to really grasp what was being said.. or rather: what implications this has</p>

        <p>and regarding covid as soon as italy locked down - i was shocked of this so obvious exaggerated, anti-democratic action, that i was curiously waiting until italians would storm their government buildings in protest.</p>
<p>i simply felt deeply how obviously wrong this political decision was for a european democratic country.</p>
<p>as there was no reaction and NO CRITICAL VOICES from media outlets or big artists, and more "democratic" countries did lockdowns i knew: the world is fucked. at least for a while. media and politics will get into the spiral of overdramatizing, like they did with the swine flu. most citizens will be in shock about the virus. this will take some time for the populace to realize the mistake</p>

        <p>There's a difference between waking up and being woke.</p>
<p>Waking up is often painful, isolating and highly inconvenient. The truth is not kind, but it is essential.</p>
<p>Being woke is a much more self serving kinds thang, giving one a false sense of virtue and righteousness.</p>
