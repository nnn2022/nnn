    <strong>So, what can we actually do?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been lurking this sub and lockdownskepticism for some time now (this was originally posted there, I want to post it here too). I even dabble in the main coronavirus subreddit from time to time to see what the other side of the conversation has to say. It probably makes sense to state that I'm somewhere between the two camps. I don't think that absolutely nothing should be done about this whole thing but I am staunchly against the current lockdown mandates and am absolutely disgusted by the way people have been treating each other over the past 8 months. I'll say that I've been able to mitigate most of the collateral damage that lockdowns would have otherwise brought upon me but am still for lack of a better term a shell of the person that I was just one year ago due to certain lockdown rules that I am unable to skirt.</p>
<p>The reason I'm making this post is, I think, first and foremost as a form of catharsis. After a solid amount of mental turmoil I've come to the conclusion that most of the tension and anxiety that I feel on a daily basis may not be because of the lockdowns necessarily but rather due to the fact that I keep ignoring this compulsion to <strong>do something about them</strong>. I'm just one person, I can't do much, nor can I stage any kind of protest for reasons that I won't get into - not that protests will really do a whole lot anyway. By putting my thoughts out there I think that I'll at least feel some form of release, but the cherry on top of it all would be if like minded individuals such as yourselves would listen and help me put into practice a strategy that might at least push the envelope ever so slightly in the right direction. What follows are my thoughts as best as I can organize them. I'll probably get to the point in some roundabout way, bear with me.</p>
<p>So let's for a second remove covid and lockdowns from the spotlight and instead focus on something that has been around for a good while now but is hopefully at or approaching its peak, which is the division of the "right" and "left" in the United States. This shit is absolutely insane and needs attention. For the sake of simplicity left = pro-lockdown and right = anti-lockdown (why those two stances were so aggressively politicized in the first place beats me). It's incredibly ironic that the very same people that are anti-government and subscribe to the idea that the government wants the people as divided as possible are the ones that are branding an entire group of people as sheep for wearing masks thus perpetuating the division. Similarly it's ironic that the left, the "my body my choice", "love and acceptance", and "mental health is important" group are the ones who are defending lockdowns with a passion and calling anyone that doesn't share their view names. It's all fucked up. If both sides would just take a step back and realize that they have the exact same patterns of behaviour, just subscribe to different echo chambers, we'd all be better for it.</p>
<p>My fear is that this'll never happen, if it doesn't happen now. This is the single time in recent history that the government is blatantly and objectively offending both sides of the political spectrum - take for example the mayor of Austin mandating everyone to stay at home while on vacation himself. Governor Newsom of California very visibly not following his own mandates (restaurant trips, vacations, his wineries staying open, his kids going to school). These are just a few that I'm naming off the top of my head, nevermind the bigger picture that you're all most certainly aware of on this subreddit. If there is no pressure on the government to change then they will most certainly continue to fuck the common folk without a second thought.</p>
<p>This whole covid situation could have one hundred percent been a catalyst for change in the United States and it's fucking depressing to watch the people squander it. In fact, I bet that I'm not alone in thinking that it's actually more depressing to watch both sides squabble than it is to actually exist in this dystopian world in the first place, which is actually only the way it is because the people allow it to be that way.</p>
<p>Alright so what am I suggesting here. Basically it's this: I know that not all of us on this anti-lockdown side are what one might call radical, but there are those who are. There are those that are self-proclaimed wolves among sheep because they stand up to orders. There are those that bravely and nobly do their errands without wearing a mask. There are those that call themselves leaders while branding the other side as followers. Conversely, there are those on the pro-lockdown side that consider us idiots for "not following the science" while patting each other on the back for their so-called superior intelligence. There are those on the pro-lockdown side that see themselves as made of grit and substance for facing the big scary world outside in their masks regardless of how uncomfortable it may be. There are those on the pro-lockdown side that see themselves as heroic because through their efforts they believe lives are being saved.</p>
<p>What I hope is obvious to you here is that everyone considers themselves the hero no matter what side you're on. There's an "us and them" groupthink mentality that exists on both sides. There's a shitload of circlejerking going off in both camps. It's all the same shit just a different narrative. That's the very problem. The real issue here is simple: the government is overstepping, that much is clear, but even if they're you are on the pro-lockdown side and disagree on that point <strong>it is increasingly apparent that there is nobody to hold the government in check. The common folk no longer have a say in what happens, the government can reach their grimy little fingers into your life, pry away everything that you hold dear, and tell you that it's for your own good.</strong> This is the cause that all should rally behind, whether you're for or against the lockdowns. It might not be the pro-lockdowners that are necessarily affected right now, but this is a precedent that will not go away, and there's no reason that it won't be their values that are stripped from them next time.</p>
<p>Let me wrap up here and make my point. This partisanship needs to stop. The pitchforks need to be put down. The pro-lockdown side has developed their narrative with the help of mainstream media and it follows that they're the most stuck in their ways due to the bandwagon fallacy. The anti-lockdown side has developed their narrative with more effort by researching facts. There are two objective truths here: 1. Lockdowns cause considerable collateral damage and 2. The government is stripping the lives of a large chunk of us common folk of many of the things we cherish and we don't even get a say in the matter, all the while being hypocrites themselves. Lockdowns are a polarizing topic. When lockdowns are concerned, there exists a left view and a right view. It's difficult to rally behind something like that. The second point however erases this polarity. There is no left or right, only us - the common folk - the ones that the government is trampling on. Whether you're for or against lockdowns, you sure as hell are likely against people taking the things that you love from you. That, in my opinion, should be the topic of discussion, and if you frame things in that context to the pro-lockdown side I think that by induction they will be more willing to agree with our point of view and thus more willing to push the envelope in the right direction. None of this "sheep vs wolves" bullshit, we're all on the same team and we need to start acting like it regardless of our differences. Before fighting the lockdowns and the bigger picture which is the massive government overstep that we've been witnessing we're going to need to make peace with each other.</p></p>

        <p>Well fucking said. I’m tired of getting lumped in with crazies and trumpers because I think lockdowns are too much, and I’m tired of getting lumped in with communists and sheep because I don’t reject the existence of this coronavirus. I think we can all agree that “we the people” doesn’t mean shit anymore, we’ve lost our unity and our solidarity. I hope to get it back, to decide once again what it means to be American, and unite under that banner instead of some partisan synthetic bull shit.</p>

        <p>I think the point I was trying to make is that labels like "trumpers" and "sheep" should cease to exist altogether. It's those very labels that pit you against your fellow man just because they might not think the same way you do. I think that the point is that people can disagree on what's right and what's wrong and still get along. Disagreeing doesn't necessitate name calling and bullying from either side. </p>
<p>I do see what you're saying though, and I think we're in agreement I might have just misinterpreted your comment. Either way please do try to continue to push the envelope further and try to make friends with those on the other side of the argument as best you can</p>

        <p>Let me be clear for the kids on here. Its not as simple as not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>This goes DEEP. Way deeper than you realize. Yes non compliance is a start and its good but that's all it is. A START. You want genuine change, from top to bottom? </p>
<p>Its going to take a hell of a lot more than that. More than hope. More than civil disobedience.</p>

        <p>Its the unfortunate truth. If the world decides freedom is worth fighting for and dying for again, maybe this shit will actually change. Until then, we have internet "warriors" going back and forth and accomplishing very little. Sigh,  getting older sucks sometimes.</p>

        <p>I can assure you that it's not nearly as simple as that. I encourage not wearing a mask, by all means. But that alone has at best zero effect on the general state of things, at worst it just pisses the opposing side off even more. If you just want to wear your heart on your sleeve and rustle feathers then you can probably just not wear a mask and be smug about it and call it a day. If what you want is change and an end to all of this bullshit you're going to have to respectfully, not smugly or from a "you're a wolf I'm a sheep" position, bring those that disagree with you to a point of understanding as to why you're not wearing a mask and what that means to you. You might think you're opposing the government by not wearing a mask alone, but they don't feel that in the slightest. On the contrary, you're merely perpetuating the division that keeps them in power. Not wearing a mask as well as alligning others with a worldview that puts less stock in their bullshit, that they feel.</p>

        <p>I'm not making excuses at all. Like I said, I encourage not wearing a mask. I don't wear one myself, I think it's stupid. However I would caution against this idea that not wearing a mask alone is somehow going to change anything at all. I can assure you that no pro-lockdowner is going to look at your maskless face in awe and think that you're some brave freedom fighter that should be followed. I can assure you that the government isn't quaking in their boots because you didn't wear a mask to pick up your groceries. It doesn't take courage to not wear a mask, just like it doesn't take courage to wear one. It's one thing to have a cause and to stick with it, that in itself is admirable I will say, but it really doesn't mean anything at all unless you actually get people on board and believe in your cause with you.</p>

        <p>Not much. The time to do "something" was 20-30 years ago. But everytime someone would say " I dont think we should trust our government or corporations and they probably dont have our ( humanity ) best interests in mind ". They would get  ( and still do  ) get shouted down as crazy conspiracy theorists. There are way to many NPC/SJW/Marxists/Karen's/Fascists/ Narcissists/Beta cuck soy boy simp incels that are happily going along with The Great Reset.</p>

        <p>I'll respectfully disagree with you. To that I say this: Who's to say that 20-30 years from now they won't be saying the same thing? I see now as opportune a moment as any to try to repair. What's all this about otherwise? Is the purpose of this forum just to sit around and make memes and point and laugh at the other side? If that's the case then I acknowledge that this whole post will likely fall on deaf ears, and if that's the case than I hate to say that you're no better than the NPC/SJW/Marxists/Karen's/Fascists/Narcissists/Beta cuck soy boy simp incels that you love to hate. If anything you're worse because you actually recognize the problem, but still shrug and say "oh well, what can you do". I'm using you in the general sense by the way, I'm not coming after you personally, because I believe that the fact that you're here at all says something positive about your character. I would argue that the only long term solution to all of this would be to do away with the name calling altogether and simply recognize those people as people. Misinformed maybe, radical, but with a bit of subtle coercion open to change and reform to a worldview that doesn't pit them against their fellow people.</p>

        <p>Nope. That's pathetic simp shit whining about name calling. There are psychopaths ( NPC/SJW/Karen/Marxists etc etc etc ) out there who want nothing more than 99.9% of humanity to be on their knees and in chains............... and yer worried about "name calling"..................... That only confirms my assessment that it's to late.</p>

        <p>Hey OP! Brilliant post. I ask you to read this which pretty much sums up our current predicament:</p>
