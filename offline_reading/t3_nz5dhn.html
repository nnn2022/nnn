    <strong>How do people still think this is about their health despite all the evidence</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve argued with many people about what’s going on and there’s some intelligent individuals that are aware about what’s going on and there’s the ones that are living in blissful ignorance and are afraid of even the slightest possibility that they may have been duped.</p>
<p>I’ve come close to losing many friends. Been ridiculed by both friends and family about where I stand with regards to all this. However a positive is that nobody has pressured me to take the vaccine or made me feel lesser because of not taking the vaccine unless we got into a heated debate. </p>
<p>I’ve come to the conclusion that you cannot reason with those driven by fear and emotion and logic doesn’t apply to them. So with advice from people here that have told me you can lead a horse to water but you can’t force it to drink. Despite my efforts to try to engage in informational discussions and share informational things I’ve been met with defiance. </p>
<p>I no longer care what these people choose to believe and I am not interested in trying to convince anyone of anything. However if I see a meme that pokes at the truth and is simple to understand then I might send it.</p>
<p>Despite my efforts to try to drone out what’s going on it seems like we cannot escape these draconian measures. I was at the soccer field today for my siblings practice and one of the admins/coaches comes up to me and says that due to covid I can’t spectate. However they said that I could get around that by walking around and moving up and down the fence. So now I can’t watch something even though I’m standing in a corner by myself. </p>
<p>This has nothing to do with science and the masses have been duped into thinking that all these measures are for their own good. Nothing feels real anymore it’s bizzare.</p></p>

        <p>It really comes down to the fact that these people would prefer to live in the safety of the government than make an effort to decide what's best for them. They prefer an all powerful overlord telling them what they can and cannot do, while being promised health and safety, all from an institution that can barely get you a license plate in any reasonable time.</p>

        <p>I'm in Canada as well, and have had the same experiences as you. When I try to explain the bigger picture of whats going on, the arguments I hear are: "This is just temporary", "Things are going back to normal now.", "It won't ever come to that", "I just care more about others than you do I guess."</p>
<p>It's so frustrating to get people to just look at all the puzzle pieces (too many to count) and they still believe it's about a virus. Now you can quote DIRECTLY from Canadian government websites, the CDC, the WEF, and still nothing.</p>
<p>Like you said, the water is all around the horse, but it ain't drinking.</p>

        <p>Exactly when you bring facts they resort to moral fallacies and emotion. I’ve had a convo with someone that said they only took the vaccine to protect their parents and when I showed articles and posts even by health Canada themselves that said “we don’t know if vaccines help reduce transmission” they started attacking me saying that since I know so much “I should start a YouTube channel” and “lets see how far you get”</p>

        <p>I've come to the same conclusion months and months ago. I stopped trying to argue with doomers because it was always a fruitless venture. The only success I've had was with my mother, but she was never hardcore-doomer.</p>
<p>At this point in the game, if people haven't figured it out yet, they probably won't until its too late. Their critical thinking has been compromised and they're holding on to the narrative emotionally. This topic is something that people have to seek truth for on their own. They don't wanna be proven wrong by someone else. </p>
<p>And at this point for me, I don't even look at the science anymore. I focus on the core issue which is the value of personal freedom and liberty. If I can't agree about the fundamentals of liberty with someone, then there is nothing else to talk about. Some of the people in this sub are very talented in their communication style and have shut down the doomers. But for me, it's a waste of time and energy. </p>
<p>I almost lost my sanity last year and I don't want to go down that road again.</p>

        <p>I feel your frustration. I feel so lonely IRL, because my husband is the one I can't get through to. I think it's just easier/less stressful for him to just believe whatever he hears from MSM and to not challenge his belief that those in power couldn't have anything but his/our best interest in mind. I've tried, but I just can't get through to him. "Conspiracy theory" is the mantra that's used to deflect any time I try to wake him up. He's more comfortable in his cocoon.</p>

        <p>Yeah that’s very unfortunate. That’s when you know the suppression tactics that have been in place since jfk times are working. Being called a conspiracist discredits your entire point and stance despite all the evidence that you may have. These days even the idea of asking questions rather than talking about theories is considered conspiracy</p>

        <p>My husband also dismisses my attempts by calling it 'conspiracy theory'.</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do but pray he won't be affected, because we already lost our baby, I can't imagine losing him. For our other children's sake, I keep researching treatments that their daddy can take in case he falls ill. He may want to live in his cocoon, happy and feeling relief that he got his shot, but I will not be so lax.</p>

        <p>I feel your pain, my husband and I divorced over this pandemic because I was a Silicon Valley insider turned whistleblower about this being a war crime/bioweapon that directly involved his military unit and China. We are back on speaking terms after a year of hell I had to deal with in regards to CIA terrorism in my life. My ex-husband is finally admitting he was wrong but so much damage has been done. My family has finally come around but not after I endured considerable character assassinations. Oh well, I know what I know, keep up the good fight. We are.living in evil times.</p>

        <p>I can definitely relate, my long term bf is the same way. At the beginning I think he was scared, but now it's just clearly too uncomfortable for him to acknowledge all the deception. I honestly believe that he is continually and consistently getting less capable of having original thoughts. It's like watching someone with dementia progressively decline, it's both maddening and heartbreaking.</p>

        <p>Some people would but they'd be too scared and isolated to do much. The crazies in our society would feel as if they can go around finally killing people they don't like.</p>

<p>I see it possible that government sponsored violence will become a thing soon, if we don't correct course. We're living in weird times.</p>

        <p>I wish you Christians would get the righteous indignation our forefathers had the balls to have. I'm so sick of this "let go and trust God" horseshit. WWJD?? TAKE ACTION. He didn't just say a prayer at the temple gates and ask God if he could kindly ask the merchants to leave. He flipped shit over. He took action. My dad was a pastor, I've seen Christians take defiant stands all my life, and <em>now</em> you decide to be fucking pussies about it? Fuck that. The church needs to TAKE A STAND.</p>

        <p>This. I have been trying to get my fellow Christians up in arms about this but get shot down. I get told that I'm being too scary and doom telling. </p>
<p>Fuck it. Jesus flipped over the money changers tables. He told Peter to sell his cloak and buy a sword. I'm tired of the passive Christian, I want to see the Christian martyrs of old.</p>
<p>So that's what I'm doing. By myself if I must, but I go and tell people wearing masks that it is all a lie. They don't work. That the shots don't even stop you from getting sick, the whole point of a true vaccine!</p>
<p>My kids are learning from me, and it will be a brutally awful day on earth if someone tries to take my children from me. I may die, but not without taking a few bastards with me. I am not afraid. Of dying or of Hell. If Hell is where I go, then so be it, God knows my heart.</p>

        <p>It's bc authority went very clear with their message that it's for safety... If they start to disagree with authority, it's much more than a wasted year they have to come to grips with... It's wasted generations... Them, their parents and even some grandparents have believed authority has had their best intentions at heart their whole lives...
