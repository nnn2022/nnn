    <strong>We tried it their way for 18 months.</strong>
    <p><p>We did the whole masking thing, and now we are being told it's not effective.</p>
<p>We did social distancing, and now we're being told it's not effective. </p>
<p>We unemployed 10% of the US workforce and then printed 25% of all the dollars ever minted during this pandemic. </p>
<p>People got the shots because they were told to, and now we're being told it's not effective. </p>
<p>We tried it their way. It didn't work, it isn't working, it's never going to work. </p>
<p>All the lockdowns, masking, school closures, jabs, and unemployed masses in the world have done NOTHING to improve the situation. We still ended up with over 600,000 alleged deaths. </p>
<p>We had the O.G. strain, two supposed European strains, and now an alleged delta variant. </p>
<p>Do you know what the definition of insanity is?</p>
<p>It's beyond time to just rip the bandaid, let everyone get their 99.98% survivable cold and cough. Stay at home, drink fluid, avoid the sick. </p>
<p>The sooner people start saying no the sooner we can be done with this crap forever. As long as people continue to comply, this will never end.</p>
<p>It began with voluntary self-limiting travel. Two weeks to flatten the curve/stop the spread. Then it was distancing, but mask if distancing was not feasible. Then it was mandatory masks. Then it was lockdowns. Then it was mandatory testing for schools and employers. Now we have shots that are voluntary but more and more employers, schools, and health care systems are toying with mandating. </p>
<p>This is sick! Never in the history of the world were people mandated to take a medication to have a job or go to school or travel. Let alone a medication that the manufacturers have explicitly stated don't prevent, treat, cure, or mitigate spread of disease. Let alone a medication that the long term implications were unknown. </p>
<p>"You don't have to take the shot but you don't have to work here either" is COERCION. When all workplaces, schools, airlines, etc have mandates in place they DONT HAVE TO MAKE LAWS TO MAKE THE SHOTS MANDATORY. Just wait, jail time is next. They'll imprison people and physically force them if we let this continue. </p>
<p>The time to refuse this medical tyranny is NOW. Well, a better time was to refuse the masking and lockdowns, but my how the slope slips from "two weeks to flatten the curve" to "take the experimental gene therapy drugs or else".</p></p>

        <p>The financial fiat system is a house of cards ready to crumble... They know it's just a matter of time and when that happens there will be unprecedented worldwide chaos as society breaks down and that shit needs to be contained and controlled because people will be looking for blood.</p>

        <p>Yeah, sorry I can't pinpoint the episodes where she spells it out, I've seen quite a few on this and other channels. She doesn't tend to repeat herself too much, she moves on and keeps it current.</p>
<p>But she always keeps my attention and provides important insights into the banker mentality.</p>

        <p>It’s really simple: The left only knows how to push. When they find resistance, they push harder. Once they’re pushing harder, that becomes their new normal pushing. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>The tea parties, brexit, Trump getting elected—all of these and more. Any time that the left feels their gains at risk of slipping they go into high gear.</p>
<p>That’s what happened with CV19.</p>
<p>Compare their reaction to CV19 to the reaction to Swine Flu under Obama.</p>
<p>In 2020, the left’s initial reaction was to try to paint Trump as racist/xenophobic for trying to limit air travel into the U.S. in order to reduce spread, while also trying to push him to take broad authoritarian steps to “slow the spread” inside the country.</p>
<p>When that didn’t work, they took up the authoritarian torch themselves—they realized that they could use the virus as a wedge in two key ways: First to attack Trump for somehow not doing enough, and second as a way to “fortify” the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Even with all their planned “fortifying”, they underestimated just how much “fortifying” they would need to do. That’s why their “fortifying” became so obvious in several states.</p>
<p>TLDR: The left played CV19 as a tool to remove Trump from office. It was always about power and dominance to the left. Always.</p>

        <p>“The left weaponized a crisis” is a relatively easy point to argue, because all the proof is right out in the open for anyone willing to spend even 5 minutes looking at what the left did, and how it directly benefited them.</p>
<p>“The left completely manufactured that crisis from top to bottom” requires a significantly greater amount of evidence, and a significantly greater degree of convincing.</p>
<p>The former can be easily argued based on what they did, on how well the accusation lines up with their actions, and on many of the political texts that they follow (e.g. SA’s RFR). Added together, that passes the test of Occam’s razor.</p>
<p>The trouble with what you seem to be suggesting is that in addition to requiring more evidence, it doesn’t seem to pass Hanlon’s razor—Assuming that you’re suggesting that GOF research funded by Fauci et. al. was intended to create this outcome at this time. The trouble there is that it’s reasonable to argue that Fauci et. al. actually believed that they were doing something to further science and medicine, and without political goals beyond.</p>

        <p>It could be to do with the crazy weather we are having as the poles are shifting. It’s not the 1st time it’s happened at all. Keeping people indoors to prevent air travel, boats fishing and curse ships and also cars being used as much. 2/3 years of lock downs may help in repairing the ozone layer. As rain is little holes in the ferment or so I think. I could be wrong.</p>

        <p>The jab is a money maker and I don’t think on its own a culler of humans. It will break down certain peoples immune systems more then the piss poor diet we eat does but both together will do it’s job. They always say there is too many humans and nothing is by accident by the elites, not enough water, land, food and yet we bin millions of tones of food and even water back into the sea. MPs get water rights in America and other countries and i read about them putting  gallons of fresh drinking water into the sea over a disagreement over the rights to it. The elites have an, it’s my ball, I am taking it home attitude. Also I’ve noticed people ask for supporting articles but I read countless articles a day. So sometimes they scrub the internet of curtain things. Just like Hollywood stars do, with injunctions and pay offs.</p>

        <p>Being generally healthy is the best way to be safe during this pandemic. The messaging should have been to eat clean, take vitamins, and exercise.</p>
<p>Instead, the messaging was “stay home, uber eats, watch netflix, get drunk and high all day.” Just non-sensical</p>

<p>Actually it’s funny because now that I think about it, Hollywood has been injecting poison into the world for 30 years through the tele screen and it has had massive consequences on our culture.</p>

        <p>Never tried it their way. I literally went and did everything I normally did. Went to the beach. Worked 31 days straight at one point. Went to restaurants that were open. Never wore a mask. Didn’t take any precautions. Didn’t catch Covid. Really freaking weird. I honestly thought I’d get it.</p>

        <p>Did the same.</p>
<p>Traveled to and from four countries, only time I wore a mask was on the planes as the fools running them wouldn't let me board without one.</p>
<p>In 17 months other than that, I have never worn a mask. I don't social distance, I haven't gotten a 'vaccine', and I don't listen to anything the news media/Fauci/Biden etc. tells me to do.</p>
<p>Still don't have Covid (even though I've now had 4 tests) and neither does anyone in my entire family who all did the same.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I gave up counting at around 30 the number of people I know obsessed with masks who quickly contracted Covid.</p>
<p>No shit, Sherlock. When you wear a filthy mask, keep pulling it on and off, touching it, and then hang it around your neck or shove it in your pocket when you're not wearing it, WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED THIS NO-LONGER STERILE MASK THEN GAVE YOU COVID, YOU UTTER MORON.</p>
<p>Every damn thing you have spread onto the mask every time you have touched it is now what you are breathing in.</p>

        <p>I hear ya dude. Sometimes I feel like I’m the only person who hasn’t ever even gotten a Covid test. My whole church had an outbreak of Covid. Like literally everyone got it. But I didn’t. I wasn’t there the week that it spread. </p>
<p>But my great uncle got it. And it killed him. Well he also had heart failure for a while before hand. I’m not going to lie. Everyone was pretty surprised that out of our family it got him. I know his heart failure probably didn’t help. But this was a tough as nails big strong man. Heard many people say they thought for sure he would beat it. Just had a bad reaction to it. But other than him I haven’t known anyone to have a bad time of it. Even the really old sick people at the church. </p>
<p>I’ve had many friends and family get it and most said it was just a cold or flu like</p>

        <p>There's absolutely no way to know an outcome from a route not taken. If you think you're instantiating in multiple realities you should probably seek medical attention ASAP.</p>
<p>Masks and sanitation were likely ineffective, at least the poor quality cloth ones common in the west. Most likely just  attempting to prevent economies from completely collapsing by giving people relatively useless things that made them feel safe enough to keep going outside at least a little bit.</p>
<p>Distancing went out the window once the mask rules were instituted though, because people felt safer than they were. Hence the skyrocketing infections in areas with shit quality masks available, like US and UK.</p>
<p>Proper ventilation works as well, but that's hard to mandate and there would probably be a bottleneck on installers, retrofitters and the hardware necessary to properly ventilate most buildings.</p>

        <p>This is so fucking stupid. People are mandated to get vaccines for public school and multiple jobs. The whole reason this stuff is dragging on is because you clowns refusee to wear masks, refused to take this seriously, then refused vaccination. Then you turn around and say "NoNe oF ThIS wORks" when you have actively stifled public health measures since the beginning. You are just so unsurmountably ignorant that it is killing other people</p>
