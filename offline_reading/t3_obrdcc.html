    <strong>Just need to get this out</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a longtime lurker of this sub - I do not post or interact at all because I'm concerned about privacy. I will probably delete this in a few days, FYI. I just need to vent and get a little support or guidance. This might be long - sorry. </p>
<p>I  have always been a planner. Before the pandemic I had a ten-year career and general life plan that was moving along beautifully. I was about to finish a master's degree, was physically quite healthy, had a thriving social life, owned my own home, and had a job I enjoyed. March 2020 was like hitting a brick wall at a million miles an hour. I did fully believe the COVID hype at first (it actually took me until early this year to wake up, embarrassingly) so I hunkered down and tried to make the best of the new reality, and I thought I'd be able to go back to my life plan once this was "over". </p>
<p>My company closed almost immediately because we were dependent on international tourism. My last semester of school was basically a complete loss, though I did earn my degree on time without celebration or fanfare. I have lost so many friends - at first just due to the logistics of lockdown but later through political differences and refusing to get the jab. My physical health has deteriorated, though I try to exercise as much as I can. I sold my condo in a large US city because the crime was getting too scary, and I now live with family. Fortunately I've found a flexible, reasonably well paid WFH gig to keep me afloat financially, and I'm extremely grateful for this job, but I can't see myself doing it for more than another 12-18 months without going completely nuts. </p>
<p>More than the tangible losses, though, is the psychological effect this has had on me. I can't make any more plans. I'm angry, sad, lonely, confused, tired, and bored. I know my previously planned path is permanently gone, and I am at a total loss of what to do now. I am afraid to even date because the topic of this godforsaken vaccination is too stressful. I don't know where to live. I am afraid of what "they" are going to do next. What more will they take from us? How much harder will it become to refuse? I wish I was emotionally stronger and was able to just say fuck 'em and live my life, but honestly I'm defeated. I don't want to live in this corporate hellscape of a society anymore. I have tried seeking out "good news" sources - but even that is dystopian AF, like the story about the school principal who worked midnight shifts at Walmart to buy supplies for his students. We are just so, so broken in every possible way. I'm starting to believe the powers that be WANT us all to fail. They want to kill us. They want us to be impoverished and unhealthy. There is no other explanation. I have never been this pessimistic about the world at large before. Fortunately I'm in the US which is in a slightly better position than Commonwealth countries and Europe - my heart goes out to all of you still dealing with byzantine lockdowns. It's unbelievable. But that is only a small comfort when I think of what's happening economically around the world. </p>
<p>tl;dr - I am paralyzed from fear, anger, and loneliness and don't know what to do.</p></p>

        <p>Hey my man, appreciate your heart felt post very much.</p>
<p>Firstly, I'd offer that the way you feel is totally understandable and normal. You're allowing yourself to feel the impact, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>We are in unprecedented times, with any normal trajectory of life thrown into the air.</p>
<p>Take some time to grieve, and don't get stuck there. If you are having health problems, look into it, I'd suggest considering things outside of normal/societal/medicalised definitions, as if nothing else, it sounds like they haven't helped so far.</p>
<p>Gabor Mate has a great book related to that, "when the body says no". Your body might be telling you something, about something needs addressing.</p>
<p>Other than that, once you've steadied a bit, find some like minded people, make some plans, but also cater for the unknowns as reasonably as you can, for example you should be able to narrow down which states makes sense to live in fairly easily. Likewise some land, self sustainability, community could be worthwhile things to work into your plans.</p>
<p>You got this, you're not alone, and these are very trying times indeed.</p>
<p>All the best.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the suggestions. I will look into the book - the title reminds me of "The Body Keeps the Score" which is another excellent trauma-recovery book. Fortunately other than being a little weaker and fatter than I was 18 months ago I'm still reasonably healthy. I do NOT trust doctors anymore and I'm afraid if I actually get sick they will give me shit for not being vaxxed. That's my biggest motivation for eating healthy and exercising - I do not want to visit a doctor under any circumstances. </p>
<p>I've been looking into off-grid living but all the regulations and bureaucracy make it SO hard to make that a reality. I just want everyone to leave me alone to live my uneventful little life.</p>

        <p>At least you found a great online community to vent in.  It helps to know there are many others like you. We’re all in the same situation.  Good news is that the narrative is collapsing as we speak.  </p>
<p>I live in Ontario in Canada and we have had the longest and most severe restrictions in the world.  About 75% have taken the first shot and 20% fully vaxxed. The govt has just moved the goalposts for reopening and the side effects are coming in.  It’s only the last few days where i have started to hear normie opposition which is incredible for Ontario - and they’re very angry. The provax crowd is getting quite violent in response.  So the good news is that it’s cracking.  </p>
<p>Just hold for a few more months and then we’ll be vindicated.</p>
<p>But it’s going to be really nasty.  Some of what you fear is inevitable</p>

        <p>Yes I am so grateful for this sub! It's like a little dose of sanity. I can't believe NONE of my friends can see what's really happening. They look at me like I have 3 heads when I say I'm not getting the vaccine and don't trust anything Fauci et al. say anymore. </p>
<p>I hope you are right that this is all collapsing. I am afraid this is just a dress rehearsal for something more sinister down the road. I guess believing that doesn't make me any better than people who think COVID will wipe out humanity. </p>
<p>Good luck up north!</p>

        <p>Yes, COVID is a real virus and some of the people who caught it early on were somewhat screwed, but at this point we know how to treat it and who is most at risk. Definitely not something to be terrified of to the point of not living your life.</p>

        <p>I still have a lingering fear of catching COVID, not gonna lie. I know it's completely irrational based on statistics, but I spent almost 10 months believing it was going to kill my entire family, and that's a hard fear to shake. It's only the past week or so that I'm going into shops unmasked and have finally decided that I am not ever going to get the jab - until recently I was "let's wait and see". </p>
<p>I know my life will never be the same. The events of the past 18 months have completely altered the trajectory of my life and my perspective on the world. The person I was in February 2020 is gone forever.</p>

        <p>Yep I’m the exact same! I know the statistics but you still hear the fearmongering horror stories and in my head I think that’s what would happen if my parents were to catch it. We are around them daily as my mom does our childcare but I feel like if I chose to let my guard down, I’m endangering her life.</p>

        <p>feel free to PM if you need to chat...<strong>you need to seriously grieve the loss of our old life</strong>. (we all had to, it took me basically all of 2020 and well into this year to mourn)</p>
<p>what helped me mourn: I felt a total loss of faith and profound tininess/helplessness. What helped me was posting comments, making youtube videos (censored off) then bitchute videos and sharing information to warn others. I don't make them anymore, because I've come to accept and <strong>come to terms with what happens next. Those who took the shot CHOOSE to. We all screamed and warned them.</strong> </p>
<p>Like Jesus said, go town to town, warn my people and if they rebuke you, dust off your heels and move on. Got that? We have to move on from them. The house is on fire and we tried to get them out, but they refuse. So we keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>you/we need to prepare mentally OP.</strong> I'm serious DM if needed. mediation/prayer/working out/eating right you gotta keep that mind of yours sharp because <strong>if these doctors</strong> (mikovitch/mccollou/yeardon/montagnier/merritt etc the list goes on and on) <strong>if they are right and we see 55 million Americans perish or severle handicapped from the vaccine it will be brutal. Bibilical. apocolptic. literally bodies eveywhere.</strong></p>
<p>There's a lot of strong evidence that we are going into a grand solar minimum. This is going to dramatically damage crops. Check out ice age farmer and adapt 2030 for more info. Food shortages, Klaus Schwab's beloved cyber polygon, grid blackouts, major 'hacks.' get prepared now</p>

        <p>I hope these most dire predictions are wrong. I'm not sure I believe millions of people will die, but I do think we will see a drop in fertility and people developing neurological disorders, etc. at higher rates. Of course there will be no public, official link to the vaccines, but those who have their eyes open will see it. </p>
<p>Honestly, if the world really does become as bad as you're saying, I'd rather just die. It was hard enough to get the motivation to work hard and succeed even before all this bullshit. Now it just feels impossible.</p>

        <p>They are trying to kill us. They are trying to impoverish us and turn us into serfs.  It's not even a conspiracy anymore just check out the world economic forum and their agenda 2021. It has other names but for people that still think it's a conspiracy that's a good place to start. Another good place to start is watching the documentary manufactured consent - however that is a point for another day. I just want to start with that I'll let you know that you are not crazy for feeling or believing that way. Many people not only in our country but all over the world are starting to see the same exact thing. You are not alone in that regard. However that's said I felt the same way you are and a little bit of peace that I hope I can share with you is that learned helplessness and social engineering are all part of what people are supposed to feel cuz that's how they come to accept what's happening around them. Because there are such large numbers of us that understand what is going on there will always always always any people that will fight back. You may have to move, you may have to cut some people out of your life, may have to change your job, but there will always be groups of people that will never accept anything other than freedom equality love Justice in all of those other aspects of natural  law. There are days where I feel exactly the same way as you hey can be so depressing that you feel like no matter what decisions you make it to protect your future or plan that did nothing you can do. Especially for people that like to be planners. But nature always finds a way. People always find a way. People will always adapt. And no matter how you feel or what anyone tells you you are important and you deserve the happiness that you are seeking. Find communities of like-minded people. In my opinion that is the single most important thing that we could all do.</p>

        <p>Yes I've been hearing about "The Great Reset" and it's genuinely so fucking terrifying. It honestly makes me wonder what the point of working for anything is if it can all be taken away but some power hungry douchebags. I really hope I can find a real life community of like-minded people. At the moment that just seems impossible. Everyone is so brainwashed. </p>

        <p>you're very welcome. Don't let fear consume you- that is another aspect of what they hope to instill in people. and remember- they keep us fighting each other to avoid watching what they are doing. if you run into people who disagree with you, focus on common ground and understand that it would be hypocritical to impose your believes on them (as much as we hate how they do it to us!)</p>

        <p>First, get off the internet. Reverse doomerism is a thing and it's more likely to happen if you spend too much time on here. Do you listen to Dave Rubin? He's very anti-new normal but makes a point to not get too depressing. Speaking of conservatives, look for conservative groups in your area on Meetup. I was super progressive before all this but now have only found sane people to talk to among conservatives/libertarians. Even if what you're saying is true (and I don't doubt there's some level of anti-humanness going on), resistance starts with the individual. We're born free and during low moments I remind myself of that. Good luck.</p>

        <p>You are definitely right - the more information I consume the worse I feel. My job is very boring and entirely screen-bound, so I pretty much just leave YouTube up all day as background noise. Maybe I should switch to music instead of news type stuff. </p>
<p>I haven't heard of Dave Rubin but I listen to Russell Brand a lot and he's weirdly upbeat about our impending social collapse. I'll check Dave out.</p>

Work remotely from non western countries and you won't have to put up with the mass hysteria, group think and restrictions. You'll also be more comfortable financially.</p>

        <p>It's interesting you say that. I have a lot of vets in my family - dad, uncle, great uncle, and grandfather were all drafted into either WWII or Vietnam. Of course I have always known going to war was a very important chapter in their lives that impacted them psychologically, but I never really appreciated how disruptive being drafted was with regard to their life plans. It came out of nowhere for them. My dad was living his best bachelor life in NYC and then all of sudden he's on the other side of the world bombing innocent people and watching his friends die, all his dreams and plans gone forever. One tiny silver lining of all this BS is that I have a much deeper empathy for others who have gone through a major crisis.</p>

        <p>I want to comment more later when I have time, but I feel you man. It's way more than words when we all say you are not alone and your feelings come from reality. Many want to downplay the struggle but that is either  nefarious or just ignorant and cowardice. As we all know, some people are deathly afraid of their world view crumbling. They won't listen.</p>
<p>I have to say, this community is one of the best support places for these convos I've ever seen. For all the hate this sub gets, go and find a more sincere and caring group of people if you can on this site. Talk about open arms and true feelings!</p>
<p>I will get back with more in a few.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the support. Yes, seeing the posts on here makes me feel so much better, even though I'm not participating actively. Usually I find a comment that is literally exactly what I would have said, so I feel like I'm still getting the benefit of the responses. </p>
<p>It's easy for me to start hating on myself for being "lazy" or making excuses for my failures - essentially gaslighting myself. Knowing that other people are feeling this same paralysis, the same grief over a life lost, makes me feel like the issues aren't just in my head.</p>

        <p>Definitely dude. I have a few hobbies that cost my time and are always leading me down new paths of research and whatnot, so I am blessed in that regard that I have the feeling of ascension even if my work life is the same.</p>
<p>Even with my somewhat regular life through this whole thing, my future and my social life has been hurt and I've lost my best friend due to differences. The social divide has been sad, and it's hit me pretty hard. I've been lucky to have some of my friends that see it similar to me, and we've grown closer. But the polarizing effect is still hard to swallow. I try not to get upset or judge people too harshly, but my frustration eats away at me at times. Each day you seem to read something else completely bonkers.</p>
<p>We are strong because we have to be. We see things through a lens that many people would be scared of. Keep to your beliefs and try and be a beacon of positive light even if you don't have faith in the future. I still know the benefit of being kind, because good energy is important in times like these.</p>
<p>We'll get through this.</p>

        <p>It is a process, and many will awaken when they realize we are in the same boat next year. Trust God🙏</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding too preachy, the Elites are working with a dark force that feeds on our misery, fear, lust, powerlessness. We should stay strong (and prepared). You are lucky you have your family with you; maybe try to make the best of it 🤗</p>

        <p>Also, to add: the good thing about our side is you know many people think like you, and many others who aren't awakened will find themselves completely hopeless and in shock in the next while.</p>

        <p>You're not alone, I feel the same way. I'm only 19. I was supposed to have - well, a life. A real one. A normal one. Not this. Not whatever is coming next. At least I had 19 years. 19 good years. A happy childhood. I've been trying to move on and live my life without thinking so much about all of this, but I'm still grieving the loss of the old world and the future I hoped for, and it's been almost a year.</p>

        <p>Ugh people your age are the ones I'm most heartbroken for. You are old enough to know what you've lost but too young to have really lived life yet. I am so glad I took advantage of my twenties to backpack around the world and make memories. Not that travel will be impossible in the future, but it will be so much more different and difficult. Not to mention college is such an important time for young people to socialize and learn who they are. I hope you are able to find a like minded partner to navigate the future with.</p>
