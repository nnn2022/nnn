    <strong>A genuine question for this sub.</strong>
    <p><p>Before I begin, I would like to state for the record that I am not a "troll", nor am I setting out to criticise those who hold differing opinions to my own or to provoke reactions for my own amusement. I am purely writing this out of curiosity, with no ulterior intent.</p>
<p>I have been scanning this subreddit idly for a few weeks now, and have noticed a common theme - one that I find rather troubling. This theme I have picked up on is that those who wear face-masks, actively "social distance", or even merely act in accordance with Government guidance which aims to keep the general public safe from the coronavirus are being shunned and vilified for the sole reason that they are "blindly" accepting the new regulations and adhering to them.</p>
<p>My question is; as somebody who lives with a family member considered "clinically vulnerable" and likely to become seriously ill when contracting COVID-19, as someone who wears a (frankly) ridiculous-looking face-mask all-hours of the school day in order to minimise the risk of myself and those around me becoming infected (despite the fact that I myself am not considered to be remotely vulnerable), as someone who deeply cares about the safety of the aforementioned vulnerable family member so as not to potentially risk their life to this terrible virus; am I to be shunned, mocked and vilified as others like me on this sub have been for not being a "free-thinker"? If so, why is that? </p>
<p>And furthermore, if people like me are to be mocked for taking precautions by you, would you expect any sympathy from those around you if you were ever in a "clinically vulnerable" state?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></p>

<p>People thinking that just because the government tells you the mask protects you- it must- because the government “aims to keep the general public safe” is worth mocking imo. We have to mock these types of people, highlighting the absurd is a powerful tool.</p>

        <p>Do not let the fanatical anti-maskers dissuade you from questioning what is happening with this virus nor make it a reductionistic issue.  I have told my family and anyone who cares to hear me that if you choose to bubble with people, wear a mask, social distance and basically keep yourself safe even if IMO the facts are not really there, that is fine.  But I ask them to please not engage in the shaming and blaming of those 'not following the rules' on social media or in person.  Because if this <em>is</em> part of an agenda, which I and others really do believe it is, then you make yourself complicit in it by engaging in that behaviour.</p>

        <p>I wouldnt make fun of you for wearing a mask.  You could wrap yourself in bubble-wrap if you want.</p>
<p>My 75 year old uncle is "clinically vulnerable". He had had several strokes and cancers and nobody in the family expected him to still be around.  But ... he got covid and was fine.  It was like a cold for him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the lockdown, with it's canceled surgeries and isolation, has been <em>very</em> hard on my dad and he is not doing well at all.</p>
<p>I care <em>deeply</em> about him.  The lockdown is killing him.  How many other seniors have <em>zero covid in them</em>, but are 7 steps closer to death because of all they have had to endure for the past 9 months and who knows how much longer?</p>
<p>We stole one of their last years alive, for a disease that even a 75yr old has a 90% chance of survival.</p>

        <p>I think in March there was no level of mockery, because we didn’t know anything and people were scared. Politicians weaponized the virus for political purposes and like every other facet of culture and policy in America, COVID became a polarized political topic. </p>
<p>For me, this has always been about personal choice and good judgement. I live alone, my family lives far away, and I don’t interact with the elderly or overly vulnerable. I wear a mask when I go out in public as a courtesy, but when I’m home, in a small group setting, outside, or somewhere where my likelihood of being in close contact with someone who has risk isn’t high, I don’t wear it. If I’m going into a public building, grocery store, anything that everyone visits, I don’t mind wearing it because I think it’s the right thing to do. </p>
<p>I can pinpoint certain moments throughout the pandemic that made me lose confidence in our elected officials’ judgement to “protect lives”. First was Fauci’s admission of lying about the public need for masks so they could get enough supplies for hospitals. Then it was the inconsistencies and non-standardization with reporting COVID deaths failing to distinguish between dying “of” COVID versus dying “from” COVID. Then it was the total rampant hypocrisy of those same elected officials to enjoy the things we’ve all been told will kill people. </p>
<p>Where I start to mock people is when they use bumper-sticker phrases and talking points to discuss what is actually a far more complex and nuanced situation. If someone sees a group of five people outside a restaurant without masks and says “ugh they’ll be in the hospital soon” or some other equally stupid remark, I tend not to take people like that seriously. </p>
<p>That was a bit of a tangent, but my main feeling about this whole thing is - if you’re an 85 year old diabetic with emphysema and you’re HIV positive, you need to take control of your situation and protect yourself from COVID. If you’re 26 years old and relatively healthy, you need to make decisions about who you interact with and then if you get sick, treat it and go back to your life. I’m not going to tell you how to best protect your family or friends, don’t impose your will on how me and mine handle this situation.</p>

        <p>I think the mainstream media and the Democratic Party have allowed this “doomer” mentality to evolve and become the main talking point because it sells clicks. Pandemics happen. People die. This has been true as long as man has walked the planet. I think many in this group are frustrated with doomer headlines and reporting, only to find out there’s more to the story (26 year old teacher dies of COVID in the title, and then way at the bottom of the article you find out the teacher weighed 400lbs and was a chronic smoker with a history of heart problems or something). Of course some young and healthy people will die, the same is true of the flu. I just hate when people take these exceptions to the rule and point them out and say “SEE STAY INSIDE OR YOU COULD DIE”. It’s disingenuous.</p>

        <p>The reason I'm against all these measures is because it's a bad flu, and you can deny that all you want, but the people I've known who've apparently had it said that's basically what it was. And yes, yes, "But it kills people!" but so does the flu, even with a vaccine, and we don't act all paranoid like this during flu season, even the "clinically vulnerable."</p>
<p>Even if it was much worse, still, freedom is the most important thing to have, and freedom in and of itself does not put anyone "at risk" since if they are really so scared, they don't have to go out where there's people. People should take their own "risks" and instead of expecting people to take responsibility for everyone around them, they should just worry about taking responsibility for themselves. Afraid of getting sick? No one's forcing you to go out, but the government is trying to force everyone to stay in and other things on people (the vast majority of whom are very healthy) and that's where the problem is. Other reasons I'm against all this is because these "measures" don't work. If they did, why are there still growing cases? We just can't live like this, especially as long as we have. Also, the "measures" as I said above, are nothing but paranoia. All these things because someone "might" have it, even though asymptomatic spread is almost nonexistent? It's just going to extremes and needless lengths and will hardly, if at all, make a difference anyway.</p>
<p>The reason I think it's blind obedience to the government is for the obvious fact that the government is telling you to do these things and were it not, would you still be taking these insane "precautions?" I doubt it.</p>
<p>Would I expect sympathy if I got it and/or if I was vulnerable? Not at all. But would I expect people to not yell at me "KARMA!" or "I TOLD YOU SO!!!!!!!" Yes. I personally am not "at risk" of the virus if I were to get it, but I do have a weak immune system. That said, if/when I get sick with anything, the absolute last thing on my mind is "People aren't going out of their way to go to extremes for me to lessen my chances of getting sick by .000000000000001 percent! How selfish!" Getting sick just happens, it's a part of life, and yeah, it sucks, but that's how it goes. I don't want anyone going out of their way for me, because to me, <em>that</em> is what's selfish. So no, I don't expect anyone to do that for me, and I don't expect anyone to be sympathetic to  me should I get sick because even before this, I just never found myself wanting sympathy. Why should I?</p>
