    <strong>How strictly are UK quarantines enforced for travellers from the US?</strong>
    <p><p>Im travelling to London in August, and it is looking like, even as a vaccinated human, I might still have to quarantine for at least five days before I’m allowed to go out. (This would be at a place of my choosing, not one of the designated hotels for red countries.)</p>
<p>This is…preposterous tbh, and I’m just wondering if anyone’s had this experience recently and if they were able to just got out and live their lives. (My friend went last summer and they were so lax that she basically didn’t bother staying inside, but maybe things are different now?)</p>
<p>Anyway, how do they know you’re complying with quarantine? Do people physically come to your hotel/rented apartment to check you’re there? Do they call you? What if you’re renting an apartment with no land line? </p>
<p>And how does the testing work if you’re not allowed to go out?</p>
<p>Any info is much appreciated. The website weirdly has a lot do text without really clarifying anything—which, I suppose, is an incredibly English thing to do.</p></p>
