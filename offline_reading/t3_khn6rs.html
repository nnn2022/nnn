    <strong>Updates on US outside state cities [NYC, LA, Seattle, Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Philadelphia, Portland,Bay Area etc]</strong>
    <p><p>Figured I would do an inquiry as to what the mindset, level of restriction and pervasiveness of pro lockdown attitudes, or lack thereof, have been in the US outside urban areas with high concentrations of white collar and/or social medfia fear mongering types.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So I was wondering how well businesses have been operating, if restaurants have been finding ways to have indoor dining and/or stay active in other ways, if mask wearing has been enforced to the point where not having them while alone in your car is considered dangerous, if there's nonstop talk of how much it's gonna kill us or if there's more talk on the need to get functional and so on.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And this is for Texas, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Alabama, Pennsylvannia outside Philly, California outside LA and the Bay Area, NY outside NYC, MA outside Boston, Illinois outside Chicago and so on.</p></p>

        <p>I live in Utah, just south of Salt Lake City. In all honesty, besides having to wear masks in stores, most things seem to be fairly normal. And ultimately there is very little talk about it. I feel like most people around me are over it. When I wear my mask on my chin at Walmart, no one seems to care and I have never once been confronted about it. Restaurants are all open. They are at limited capacity (around 50% I think), but unless you are going out to eat on Friday or Saturday night at a popular place, it doesn't feel that different. My kids are all at in person school. Movie theaters are all open. Drama theaters as well. Few people seem to be that concerned about Covid. The closer you get to Salt Lake City, the more "serious" people seem to take things, but their voice has been shrinking every day. It wouldn't take that much for things to be completely normal here.</p>

        <p>Tiny town in Indiana... It's really split 50/50. There's a lot of arguing amongst people for being on the other side via community page.
I stay out of it.</p>
<p>Things are open but masks are required and it's hit and miss as to who's enforcing shit. Schools are remote.</p>
<p>I'm emotionally exhausted. I'm sick of being looked at like I'm going to contaminate and kill the entire town for not wearing a mask.</p>
