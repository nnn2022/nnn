    <strong>C.S. Lewis describes the current pro-lockdown and pro-mask agenda drivers in 1942.</strong>
    <p><p>So years ago I saw this posted during the midst of a gaming-related SJW movement.</p>
<p>The poster had used it to describe the mentality of the rising SJW crowd and looking back on it, it fits perfectly with the now pro-lockdown/pro-mask crowd.</p>
<p>&rt; This is the end result of one of the tempting strategies listed by C.S. Lewis in "The Screwtape Letters." Each man's relationships with others is a series of concentric circles. The innermost one is the self, followed by close friends and family, followed by his larger friendly circle, and so on. On the outermost edge are people he's never met, seen, or knows the name of: a nebulous 'other.' Society has made it impossible for somebody to think everything is fine when somebody only cares about himself, but the strategy set forth in the book is to keep all charitable feelings as far out as possible for people the person has never met and could never hope to aid directly. This keeps him from feeling like a selfish douche when he's a jerk to everybody else.</p>
<p>&rt; In this case, this person cares so much about unnamed 'women' and 'minorities' that he's willing to be downright inhuman towards the real people he actually knows, justifying it on behalf of people he will never meet and who never asked for his help.</p>
<p>Simply replace unknown women and minorities with unknown elderly and that's who is out screeching right now.</p>
<p>Just something to think about.</p></p>
