    <strong>Washington state is headed for another lockdown and I’m so frustrated.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m so frustrated with the panic buying. I have a baby. I know other people who are buying diapers also have babies but I can’t help but be frustrated. I’m seventeen on Friday so I’m a young mom. I live in a small house on my parents’ property with my fiancé (baby’s dad.) Anyways, my mom has a Costco membership and goes once every two weeks. She went today and she’ll usually get me a box of diapers but they didn’t have any. Later in the day I went to several stores looking for some but I couldn’t find any. We have enough diapers to last a little while longer but I’m scared we’ll run out. I don’t understand why people think they won’t be able to shop under lockdown. It’s irritating.</p>
<p>I know this is irrelevant, but because Friday is my birthday my fiancé and I were going to go out to dinner and leave our son with my parents. Now we can’t do that and we’ll probably go tomorrow since it’s the last day before lockdown. His twenty-first birthday is in early December and he was going to go out with his friends but now he probably can’t do that. I’m so bummed, I know he’s been looking forward to it. Between working during the day and coming home to a baby, I know he needs a break.</p>
<p>We were going to get permission to get married before I turn eighteen but now I know that’s not going to happen. The courts are going to be slow as fuck and the excuse for their laziness will be “covid.” I wanted a little ceremony and I’ve already been looking for a cheap little dress. I was going to be a bride. </p>
<p>God, I’m just so frustrated. We can’t do this again.</p></p>

        <p>Buy some pre owned cloth diapers online. We used them for 2 years each for our kids. Saved money and never worried about running out. </p>
<p>They seem intimidating but are simple to get the hang of.</p>

        <p>Piggybacking off this comment.  I use patpat.com alot and they have deals right now for $1 cloth diaper covers and a whole pack of liners for the diapers for $12. Also ive been stocking up on diapers at samsclub online. Idk about Costco but if they have online order/delivery you may have more luck with that</p>
