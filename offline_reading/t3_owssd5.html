    <strong>The fact so many democratic countries immediately shut down is fucking terrifying.</strong>
    <p><p>I thought democracy was about liberty and I guess I was wrong. The amount of people who want safety over liberty is disturbing. This just proves that these "democratic" governments have more power than they appear to have.</p></p>

        <p>Personally I don't buy the fraud narrative --I believe the lax COVID-era voting rules (24 hour voting, easy mail in ballots without ID, etc) played to Biden's advantage just enough to edge out a win.  I'm not a fan of Biden, but I see him as the legitimate president. Of course, that's only my opinion.</p>

<p>So a person could collect ballots, fill them all out and mail them in without showing ID? And these votes were counted? </p>
<p>And all these votes mysteriously arrived after Trumps votes were counted and everyone went home? And all these votes coincidentally went for Biden?</p>

        <p>I support the new voter ID laws, the end of 'ballot harvesting' etc. that you mentioned --I'm surprised they even were allowed in the first place. The new voter reforms in the Southern states sound reasonable to me. </p>
<p>I'm most familiar with Georgia, and listening in depth to the testimony of the Secretary of State and the top Elections Officials I felt there wasn't any fraud in Georgia, anyhow. I'm not familiar with the other states.</p>

        <p>We saw what we saw on election night, Trump leading handsomely in many crucial states at the end of election night... but then a few days later we watched a winner turn into a loser with no explanation except "trust us."</p>
<p>As of now, the trivial explanation is more people voted for Biden during the mail in voting period. But we already know mail in votes are sent to every address in a state so anyone can intercept and return them with a squiggly signature and it will be counted as a vote. No ID. No proof of citizenship.</p>

        <p>I agree, the lack of ID or proof of citizenship is insane and makes it easy for wide-open for fraud. I mean, you need an ID to buy a case of beer, but not to vote (?).</p>
<p>Everything you've said makes sense, but if that was the case it'd be hard to prove it. What makes me skeptical of Trump's claims is that he was claiming election fraud even before the first ballot was cast, and his phone call to Georgia's Secretary of State ("find me 11, 798 votes") makes it appear as though Trump was trying to create his own election fraud.</p>

        <p>Umm, yes..? The whole premise of stealing votes is to forge signatures on another person's ballot. Or was that rhetorical and missing an /s?</p>
<p>Unless you think election officials are actually comparing signatures of each mail in ballot to a very minute detail? Seeing as most signatures are just handwriting a name, this too can be circumvented pretty easily if you think this way.</p>

        <p>So if a signature is similar the vote will pass. Signatures change over time. Is your theory that they only count votes with completely identical carbon copy signatures? </p>
<p>May I ask if you've heard the term "ballot harvesting" and if you think having a third party decide which vote gets counted is the correct way to do things?</p>
<p>If older people tend to vote for candidate A, and you work for candidate B, then what incentive do you have to turn those elderly votes in if the other candidate gets the votes?</p>
<p>What if you paid a person for their mail in ballot and had them sign it? Is that a fair vote?</p>
<p>At least with absentee ballots you request it before hand, instead of blindly mailing every address in the state with voting ballots only to have some grifter come and buy it from you because you weren't going to vote anyways.</p>

<p>Since in many cases the "audits" that you keep hearing about in the press, never verified signatures.  In several cases the error rate was so high(like in GA, MI, and IL), that the ballots should have been automatically discarded - but instead were counted.  With some mismatch rates being north of 65% or more, so the short answer is yes.</p>
<p>Remember as well, that several people started looking into the mail in votes.  And found hundreds of people apparently living in empty fields, PO boxes, and condemned buildings.</p>

        <p>There are two major problems with democracy as I see it: </p>
<p>1.) through universal suffrage, democracy devolves into tyranny of the majority, potentially threatening the existence of dissidents and minorities, and </p>
<p>2.) the masses are easily hypnotized and easily manipulated by an oligarchical elite to do whatever they want, no matter how absurd or irrational.</p>
<p>We see this playing out in real-time. The outcome of democracy is always tyranny because democracy simply doesn't work. Even the ancient Greeks knew that democracy eventually devolves into tyranny.</p>

        <p>This is why an electoral college and the right to bear arms are the only way for a society to truly have liberty. Population density basically ruins democracy because without an electoral college not everyone gets full representation.</p>

        <p>Welcome to lockstep.</p>
<p>The reality is it's never been any different. Democracy is just the system by which those who already rule and hole power legitimize their rule and power.</p>
<p>Also look into the iron rule of oligarchy. Democracy is a fiction, it never has and will never exist on any level resembling anything larger than a micronation. Even in a hypothetically democratic nation there will be intellectuals, pundits, huge companies and news networks that sway opinion, the average person's opinions aren't his own, rather whatever his favorite item from above told him.</p>

        <p>That's why they're working overtime to criminalize right-of-center opinion.  Calling the January 6th LARPing event "the worst threat to democracy since the Civil War" and ramping up show trials for all the participants, who were hunted down and arrested by the hundreds.  Somewhere, Stalin smiles.</p>
<p>After establishing a social environment which redefines patriotism as pathology and civil liberties as dangerous to the herd, the "red flag" laws can be used to seize individuals' guns, and the troops can be mobilized to put down any groups.  Any groups not already completely infiltrated by the Federal Bureau of Instigation, that is.</p>

        <p>All democracy means is that the people get to vote on who makes the laws. If the people vote for politicians that make laws that say that they can shut down the country, its still democracy. The founders preferred a republic with democratic institutions to avoid the trap of tyranny of the majority</p>

        <p>Communism sure isn't.</p>
<p>But the US Founders firmly believed, based on all historical evidence up to that time, that pure democracies inevitably destroyed themselves ("three wolves and one sheep deciding what to have for dinner"), and that's why they chose a representative Republic instead.</p>
