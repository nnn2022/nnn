        <p>There was a news article on Facebook reporting how two positive cases broke home quarantine, and police came after them and fined them a big amount.     </p>
<p>All comments were in the vein of "they should be put in jail", "weld their doors" and so on.       </p>
<p>I asked why can't they go out wearing masks, since those are key, as we're being drilled everywhere all day every day.       </p>
<p>They jumped at me like wolves lol. Their conclusions were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Masks are for protection from possible unconfirmed sick people, but           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks don't actually protect well enough if you're a confirmed case.      </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Still they can't see the cognitive dissonance.</p>

        <p>Lol another great point. Why would anyone want to get tested? Just stay home if you are sick. Itâ€™s pretty straightforward. </p>

        <p>If you read the projections and academic documents it is because they think all things work, a little.</p>
<p>Masks reduce spread less than a third, social distancing around 13%, etc.</p>
<p>They don't think that things like masks work THAT well, it is just that if you do it there will be a marginally lower death toll.</p>

        <p>I know their arguments. But that basically proves our point. That masks do very little to slow the spread. People act like masks are some kind of a magic bullet and this whole thing would just go away if people just wore masks. My point is that these people are wrong. </p>
<p>I do not agree that the final death toll will be significantly lower because of mask usage. The only way they would potentially save lives is if there is a safe and effective vaccine available to all people, before the virus has had time to run its course. When you see how quickly this thing spreads, I donâ€™t see any way thatâ€™s going to happen. </p>
<p>You could probably save a lot more lives by giving people non-deadly cold viruses to build up cross-immunity.</p>

<p>Coronviruses that cause the common cold are still potentially deadly and cause serious complications to those actually at risk of this virus. People not at risk of this virus may as well get this virus, it's for the most part the common cold for us, since the spread inevitable and you could not inoculate people with the other coronaviruses quick enough anyway.</p>

        <p>I have never seen a human being get seriously ill from a coronavirus other than SARS or MERS. Iâ€™m not talking about infecting sick or immunocompromised people. Just healthy people. I think it could save a lot of lives and we need to look into it.</p>

        <p>Yes, people get seriously ill, are hospitalised, and die from complications following common cold viruses including the coronviruses, HCoVs. Congrats for never seeing one I guess? They are not going to risk releasing higher numbers of infections into the community and unbalancing their natural existing levels by inoculating the masses with any of those viruses, when they too have the potential to kill those at risk from <em>this</em> virus. </p>
<p>While there is evidence of cross-immunity and that it plays a role, there isn't enough to justify inoculating people with live viruses that may disrupt their natural levels of existence. Especially when the whole reason people are up in arms over this virus is because they claim to care about those at high risk and it spreading to them and no death being acceptable - well those viruses could spread to and kill those same people. So I hardly think they would support this, unless ignorant of the risk since people have this idea - and it seems you do too - that common cold viruses are harmless to all.</p>
<p>Healthy people may as well just get this virus now, and there is no stopping it from happening. If you think researchers even have enough HCoVs floating around to significantly infect healthy people to make any difference...</p>
