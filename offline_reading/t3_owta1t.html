    <strong>On Being Prepared in Case of Another Lockdown (RE: Medical Martial Law)</strong>
    <p><p>As everything seems to be in flux, it is apparent that the folks running the insane asylum will be re-instituting the Medical Martial Law that we witnessed last year. Regardless of your socio-political leanings, I think it is important that you be prepared in case things go south. I have learned the hard way from Hurricane Sandy, to the several snow storms that knocked out power for weeks in my area. You need to have a plan.</p>
<p>Have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>water </li>
<li>storeable food</li>
<li>flash lights, candles</li>
<li>walky-talkies</li>
<li>a Bug out bag</li>
<li>a means of self defense to protect your property, family and yourself</li>
<li>maps</li>
<li>bug out location</li>
</ul>
<p>This part is tough, but I think it is vitally important to find like minded individuals, try to involve family or friends but most important keep your circle small. It is not a charity, those that fail to prepare is their problem, not yours; in other words, lack of preparation on their part does not constitute a problem on your part.</p>
<p>It is better to have these items and not need it, then to need it and not have it but most importantly: have a plan.</p></p>
