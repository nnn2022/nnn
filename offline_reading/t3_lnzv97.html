    <strong>Grandpa wants the vaccine, I’m worried for him.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been a longtime lurker here, not really making posts just making comments, I’m pretty up to date about all the bullshit they have been spreading and trying to keep the clown world in check. My grandpa recently told me he’s gonna get the vaccine, I’m just afraid the vaccine will do him more harm than good because with all the people saying they got the shot, and days or weeks/months later dying or being seriously ill after that, any sources to open his mind to these possibilities? He’s really hard to try and talk to about this.  He’s 71 with a heart condition, he has sleep apnea, anyone else’s grandparents have the vaccine? If so, anything happen? I hope I can post this here, I just feel I would get shit on if I posted elsewhere. Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>My grandfather is extremely medically fragile, 92 years old, and had 2 cardiac arrests in October. He just got his second dose this week and is doing fine. He got sore and tired with the first dose, but suffered no ill effects (so far) from the second. I was very concerned about him receiving the vaccine, but he is cognitively sound and still capable of making his own medical decisions so I did not try to discourage him. It was completely his choice to be vaccinated just as it is mine to not receive the vaccine. I work in the medical field and know dozens of people who have received the vaccine of all ages, and no one has suffered anaphylaxis nor any other serious side effects. That’s not to say that this vaccine can’t have concerning effects or is “safe” in the long term, but maybe try to respect your grandfather’s decision-it’s his to make.</p>

        <p>Thank you, that does make me worry less about it now. It’s hard what to think when you see all these posts of the people that were vaccinated having bad reactions to it. Absolutely, I respect his choice. I can’t imagine what it’s like to be an elderly person at this time, uncertainty.</p>

        <p>Good to hear their spirits are up! I hate to see my grandpa not being able to do what he truly wants. He’d be in Florida right now on vacation but he’s worried of the COVID. He manages an American legion that is slowly going out of business I can’t believe they haven’t yet. I don’t know what to think of this COVID anymore to be honest.</p>

        <p>Your grandfather is in the group of people who should get the vaccine for things like this, and the flu.</p>
<p>For someone of his age and health condition, COVID 19 would be a coin flip for survival for him.   I myself won't touch the vaccine as I view it as a poorly calculated risk, but I certainly would advocate for my grandmother, who has had congestive heart failure and was operating with 25% heart function to get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Many nursing home seniors are dying from COVID as well.  Hell they ARE the bulk of the stats.  There's a reason they lump the 50-65 crowd in with the over 65s.</p>

        <p>I’m talking about the nursing homes where there wasn’t a single death before the vaccine, and then 10-20% die after the nursing home is vaxxed. I would say that’s highly suspicious!</p>

        <p>Just explain to him that there are risks to the vaccine as well, and he'll hopefully factor that in to his decision. My grandparents had their first dose and I too am worried about the second so I hope for the best. If it works out alright then it'll be worth it for someone his age, but for people who are actually at risk from this it's a really hard decision to make.</p>
