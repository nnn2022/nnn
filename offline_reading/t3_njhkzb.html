        <p>&rt; Evidence of systemic detection of spike and S1 protein production from the mRNA-1273 vaccine is significant and has not yet been described in any vaccine study.</p>
<p>Translating a few scientific terms: </p>
<p>"systemic"  this means "system wide" - in a medical context, it means circulating in the bloodstream and moving around your body.</p>
<p>&rt; and has not yet been described in any vaccine study.</p>
<p>That this had not been studied and results published before emergency use authorisation was granted is a fucking disgrace. </p>
<p>Moderna - makes vaccine to produce spike protein. "It has a special anchor - it will stay within the target cells" </p>
<p>Question - any evidence spike protein leaves the target cell? </p>
<p>"It has a special anchor"</p>
<p>6 months later - <strong>the first study</strong> looking for spike protein outside the target cells.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve read through the paper. Spike proteins formed, as theyâ€™re meant to. As initial immune response is mounted the spike proteins diminish. In some of the participants there was a transient rise in spike proteins after the initial drop. They eventually dropped down again. Researchers speculate it may be that the cells which initially made the spike protein were destroyed by tcell response, spilling some into the blood. Eventually, spike proteins were undetectable in all participants. 
Important to note, they used very sensitive serology for the study, they could detect minuscule amounts of spike.
Whatâ€™s described by all accounts is an appropriate response to a vaccine.</p>
<p>I think all this covid stuff is bullshit, lockdowns etc are fucked.</p>
<p>But this papers findings are not a cause for concern. Me..a doctor, whoâ€™s life has been turned upside down by all this shit. And spent most of last year tending to sick patients for all things but covid, just people who waited too long because of fear of covid. And who is also waiting for full vaccine trial to be finished before getting a jab, much to the surprise of some of my colleagues
Important to note</p>

        <p>Cooler heads will prevail in all this. It serves no purpose getting in a fuss about this paper. Iâ€™m scientifically literate and against all these lockdowns and like I said waiting for the full study to be completed.</p>
<p>There are things to worry about, vax pass and coerced vaccination. Possible side effects aside, the totalitarian tone of it all it the biggest worry for me. Iâ€™d be just as against forced mmr vaccines, which we know to be safe.</p>
<p>Back to this paper...transient circulation of spike proteins in minuscule amounts which drop as igg and its rasies. Done, immune response. And it was only in 13 patients too, as the author states -needs more investigation. The findings are not worrying, if they found consistently elevated and progressive elevation, then yes that would be concerning, but it didnâ€™t show that.</p>

<p>yes - "the fuss" - is that there was insufficient testing before pushing a therapy on the entire global population. </p>
<p>If people are not aware of the risk, they cannot make an informed choice. </p>
<p>If risks were not known, and testing had not been conducted, then regulators are guilty of gross negligence.</p>
<p>If governments are aware regulators are guilty of gross negligence, and do nothing, governments are guilty of crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>It is that fundamental.</p>
<p>The paper here is focused on bio-distribution of translated protein.</p>
<p>Do we have bio-distribution data for the mRNA?</p>
<p>I suggest we don't...</p>
<p>Whats happening is criminal - cold headed objectivity.</p>

        <p>What you say is true. But the findings of this small study are no concerning. Like I said if it found persistent spike proteins production that would be. But like I tried to say, the information in this particular study is not a concern. Your efforts are better spent elsewhere. Tomorrow there might be another study that shows something of concern, this one doesnâ€™t.</p>

<p>I think its the lack of data that is the biggest concern. The tests that havn't been done. The 12000 european vaccine deaths, the countless injuries - </p>
<p>studies like this - academically interesting - yes.</p>
<p>but 6 months into rollout - its highlighting the complete failure to test - this is our bio-distribution study?</p>
