        <p>Some knew for sure since April cause it didn't make it any sense, covid 1984 only became a "pandemic" when the propaganda networks said so, there was never any increase in hospitalization anywhere from November 2019 to end March 2020 when the lockdown hoax started... The fact that it's being questioned by some "news networks" in some main stream articles is a good sign.</p>
<p>UK &amp; Australia main stream are openly calling it an agenda, Australian called out the great reset agenda by klaus the clown. By Christmas, even your grandma will know about the great reset/depopulation agenda!</p>

        <p>In my humble opinion, the pandemic hasn't been proven to be the conspiracy. I think there are quite a few people that know, without a doubt, the virus, causing the pandemic, was manufactured in a lab somewhere. I believe this to be true but, it may be a very long time before we see irrefutable evidence proving it. We may never see it. I don't know. Evidence of a manufactured virus, leaked accidentally or purposefully released on the population, would be very, very protected by those responsible.</p>
<p>I do believe the response we have seen, by governments all over the world, is the conspiracy. It is a coordinated response. We are seeing the same measures taken in countries and cities all over the world. When they are taken may differ slightly. The severity may differ slightly. How they are enforced has been different in many places. However, the measures, the response, the masks, social distancing, the stay at home orders, do get implemented, without fail. </p>
<p>The responses to a virus, with a remarkably low fatality rate, do not make much sense. They have left many people scratching their heads. The solutions to the problem are extreme. We have never responded to a health crisis, the same way we have been asked to respond to this one. We didn't respond to Ebola like this. We didn't respond to H1N1 like this. We have never responded to any flu season like this. All three, statistically, are similar to the current virus. People get sick. People die. We are surrounded by unpleasant viruses and diseases. It has been this way since the beginning of time. </p>
<p>So, why this extreme response? Why are such extreme measures being offered as the only solutions, that must be implemented, by organizations and individuals who are proving difficult to trust? And, why do these organizations and individuals feel it is necessary to enforce these measures with such force? It is very difficult to understand.</p>
<p>A very intelligent person once told me, if the response to something, or the outcome of something is so clearly different than what it should be, corruption is usually involved. Something nefarious is going on. More than likely, two or more people have conspired, they have agreed, especially secretly, to do something wrong, evil or illegal. I would say the response we have seen, to the pandemic, are all three things.</p>

        <p>&rt;Eight months on, my burning question remains unanswered. What is really going on? About 50 millon people die each year worldwide. Some deaths are preventable, others not. Over the course of 2020, this pandemic has claimed 1.1 million lives; most of whom were elderly or already ill. Heart disease kills 17 million annually; cancer 9.6 million. Respiratory diseases, including bronchitis, pneumonia and emphysema take 2.5 million lives a year.
Why then, are we still playing this ridiculously destructive game with healthy peoples’ lives – a risky experiment that, as is starting to emerge, will very likely <a href="https://archive.is/WNRsy">kill more people than it saves in the long run?</a></p>
