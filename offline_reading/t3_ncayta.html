    <strong>Can someone explain to me in clear, objective terms, what the members of this subreddit want?</strong>
    <p><p>"Restoring our old ways of life" isn't really an objective statement or anything that can be measured or defined. What exactly do you want? How is it possible to achieve that in a changing world?</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for not being a dick like some people. The main thing here is skepticism that the lockdowns and vaccines are really the best thing that we can do in regards to Covid. There’s many other things but that’s the big one. For me, I recall my 21st in February 2020, right before SHTF. There was a Jason Aldean concert in my state so I went; sold out stadium, people going to work everyday, lot less hatred for varying opinions, etc.</p>

        <p>Can you explain what you think is the best thing to do in regards to COVID? At first, I remember people on this subreddit not wanting lockdowns and masks. They wanted herd immunity, and going back to a maskless life. But now that we have a solution to get to herd immunity, no masks, and a normal life, people are refusing to take it. One of my coworkers says she doesn’t want to get vaccinated because she thinks there are better solutions, but she won’t say what those solutions are. What are the alternatives in your eyes?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, many people can’t or just don’t do that. With regular colds and flus, people still come to work because either they don’t care, or because we don’t have legislation requiring sick leave. Like I fully agree people who are sick should stay home. If they did, pretty much no disease would spread and it would be awesome. </p>
<p>But with COVID, unless every unvaccinated person were tested regularly, it is very hard to keep carriers home. It’s an unfortunate virus because it can spread so easily before symptoms start, if they ever do. I don’t see how we could keep everyone with COVID home, because it’s hard to tell if someone has it. How would you suggest dealing with that?</p>

        <p>While I 100% agree with that approach as being part of the solution, I’m not sure it addresses the second half of my comment: the concern that people easily spread COVID before people even know they’re sick.</p>

        <p>Well I think people should do whatever they feel comfortable doing. At the end of the day, if you’re scared then you have every right to stay home and I won’t blame you for it. What I don’t think is right however is forcing your fears and beliefs on me or others that want to go about their lives how they do, and should have every right to do so .</p>

        <p>Thank you for the answer. I’m curious, though, at what point you believe people do have a responsibility to change the way they are living and should need to follow guidelines to protect others. </p>
<p>For example, if the situation in America were the same as in India, and hospitals couldn’t treat the number people who were sick and dying, would you agree with shutting down temporarily to reduce spread? </p>
<p>If the disease were more deadly, like the smallpox epidemic where the Supreme Court upheld mandatory vaccination, would you fight against being vaccinated? </p>
<p>Or if, like in WW2, we were required to turn off lights in our homes at night to prevent bombers from seeing and striking our towns? </p>
<p>There are a lot of situations where individuals are expected or required to follow guidelines for the purposes of public health and safety. We must adhere to road rules/stoplights, submit a negative TB test to attend university, and participate in fire bans during wildfire season) and I personally don’t see requiring a choice between wearing a mask or getting a vaccine as particularly different from those.</p>

        <p>I think all have come to a realization that there is no going back.</p>
<p>So in some ways you are correct.</p>
<p>Most people here are not radical. Most don’t subscribe to conspiracy theories and the like. We are very diverse in opinion on many things but what we seem to agree on is not rushing into things without proper study and answering a battery of tests that any medicine would go through. </p>
<p>What most people here don’t want is implementing something that has not passed the tests established through some very hard earned lessons. </p>
<p>We are appalled that so many of our country folk are so willing to forget these lessons. This is a slippery slope.</p>

        <p>I want people to work towards backing down from their hypochondria.  I want them to look at the actual data instead of just the sensational takes we see in the media.  I want them to calculate their personal risk, compare it to other things and hopefully put it in perspective and be able to move forward towards the goal of eating at restaurants again or going to a movie theater.  I want people to regain their comfort to be around people again, and I'm a freaking hikikomori.  I feel bad watching all the normal people I know give into the pathological fear cycle that's consumed so much of my own life, even before covid.</p>
<p>I'd like them to also believe the CDC that I'm not a mortal danger to them because I haven't taken the vax.  I want them to accept I've got a higher personal risk, but I'm also not sick, and covid isn't near as contageous as measles.  If I got sick, I'd stay home.  It wouldn't spread, I don't live with anyone so the only person in danger would be me.  I want them to appreciate that my mental illness around vomiting puts me at far greater risk from the side effects of the vaccine, than continuing my efforts of avoid covid.  If I die, I die.  I'm fine with that.  Mathematically, it's not a likely outcome.  I want them to have a little compassion for me instead of coercing and bullying me, because if I vomited after succumbing to their abusive social pressure, I would hold them responsible and that would end poorly for everyone.  I want to avoid that outcome.  I'm fine risking a 0.05% chance of death if I get covid for that.  I just wish my friends wouldn't treat me as a leper because of it.  Frankly, that's just because they want to be bigots, but so many angles of bigotry are unacceptable now.  This is just the one avenue they've been given permission to exercise the worst of human nature in.</p>
