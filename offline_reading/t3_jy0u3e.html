    <strong>Struggling to remain on track</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys </p>
<p>Just posting as a way of feeling somewhat normal amongst those who feel the same way. I hate that my social interaction since this all started is now 99 percent online (I’ve always had a hard time keeping up with a social media presence it just feels hollow to me)</p>
<p>I’m struggling with these stupid rules and Boris popping up on tv and online telling everyone to wear a mask and push on. Push on to what exactly? </p>
<p>I’m stuck with no job since March (a role in a creative industry I gave years of my life to) I also lost my side job (real passion) as again it’s in a creative field and every venue is closed. I’m self employed with no clue where to go from here and if any of my work will survive this. </p>
<p>I’m struggling living with my alcoholic abusive mother who since this lockdown started has seriously gotten worse. She’s gone from a evening drinker mainly to a all day and all night one. Going to the shop at 8am for vodka. </p>
<p>It’s ruining my sleep, my peace, my mental health. My doctor took me off the register accidentally in April and now I receive automated responses that I must email to re register but by no means come in to the practice. They haven’t replied to a email for weeks.</p>
<p>I’m sick of emails!! I’m sick of all this weird distancing and people moving away out of fear when I walk by too close. </p>
<p>Before this I was already struggling this year with losing a baby (miscarriage) in Jan plus living with my alcoholic mother and the stress that brings but I had hope to leave, I had hope to save and move out. It was already taking all my strength to focus on that then the great Covid arrived.</p>
<p>I’m really trying to stay positive but this is all starting to weigh me down and I can’t handle much more darkness. How are you staying positive? I could do with some tips </p>
<p>I just wanted to get this off my chest as I have few people to talk to at the moment and I keep on a facade that I’m doing ok but sometimes like today I don’t believe myself.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p></p>
