    <strong>The trance-like behaviour exhibited by the many victims of this totalitarian cult of statism we are seeing take shape in our society.</strong>
    <p><p>To put it lightly, the past year has been an absolute shitshow. Weâ€™ve seen a lot of very strange occurrences and I feel as if I have seen a lot of things that have induced various paradigm shifts in my perception.</p>
<p>One of the biggest things that comes to minds is the tendency of the weak and fearful towards authoritarianism. It seems that when people of lesser strength and character are faced with a true dilemma or threat, they will run to authority and beg for salvation. </p>
<p>They will ignore all bad behaviour on the part of their saviours and will not accept any evidence of them having done harm. </p>
<p>They will do whatever authority tells them to without any real thought or consideration and will engage in endless mental gymnastics and rationalization to keep their faith in authority strong.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to reason with these people, even to get them to consider they are being misled.</p>
<p>They are so set in their beliefs and the word of their saviour that it is cultish, no outside information or logic can break their trust in authority and open their mind to the possibility they are being deceived or misled.</p>
<p>Once inside this cult, it is almost impossible to escape due to the social reinforcement from those around you and the endless stream of propaganda you will inevitably consume if you have faith in the media and government. </p>
<p>You will view anybody trying to open your mind on an issue or showing you a different perspective the same way a religious man centuries ago looked at a heretic or a blasphemer.</p>
<p>There is no rationalization too great and no piece of evidence shocking enough to rouse these people from the trance-like state they have ended up in.</p>
<p>The only way out is to choose to open up your mind to alternate possibilities and think critically and that is strongly incentivized against as well as outright shamed in this totalitarian cult of statism, causing few to make the leap or even take the first steps required to see past all of the propaganda and manipulation.</p>
<p>As critical thinkers and open minded folk, we have to resist this pathological groupthink as strongly as humanly possible. </p>
<p>This kind of behaviour is posing an enormous threat to our society at large and this sort of complacency and complicity in the face of malevolence will be our undoing if we continue to engage in it. </p>
<p>It is the duty of those of us that can see through it all to show others the ways in which they are being deceived and to do everything we possibly can to avoid allowing this dystopia we are being dragged towards to be established.</p>
<p>Fight for what is correct and do not let up. All is not lost.</p></p>

        <p>Collectivists/statists are the real disease. Like you say, totally cult-like devotion to their God, the State.
This age of the lowest common denominator is not a good one. The masses are too stupid and complacent.</p>

        <p>I tried. I pretty much have given up. It's like trying to convince people their religion is wrong. I think the best we can hope for is to just move to countries/states that are saner/more free and allow the people around you to chart their own destiny.</p>
