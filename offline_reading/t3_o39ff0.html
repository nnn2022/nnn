    <strong>International COVID passports seem reasonable to the general public. The NATIONAL COVID passport is hiding its hideous face behind it - here's one possible future:</strong>
    <p><p>INERNATIONAL COVID passports are being purposely blurred with NATIONAL COVID passports.</p>
<p>Make sure people know the difference, and how the international one will be the thin end of the wedge.</p>
<p>The (alleged) idea is we all get one for international travel, but then more and more inner-country restrictions are added. No more city to city travel, no more Concerts, music festivals, eating out..... no more food shopping.... no more voting without our national passport.</p>
<p>We'll use it in the end for the library, cashless payments, ID, doctors, insurance, all medical, criminal, travel, political details.</p>
<p>Worldwide... we'll each have a unique Id..... it will be a "Super social security / National Insurance number / Passport reference / credit score / Social credit score" all rolled into 1.</p>
<p>Imagine the CONTROL of our lives with it.</p>
<p>Anything and everything we can do can be given or taken away by "society" (organisations running our political system). First international travel, then national travel...... then our "right" to go to music festivals.</p>
<p>Imagine not paying a speeding fine - and then discovering you can't swipe the entrance to the local Wallmart.</p>
<p>"You have outstanding police fines - please visit your local station before entering Wallmart. Have a nice day!"</p>
<p>And just to make your life miserable - you call for a cab to the police station..... "Sorry, you have outstanding police fines which make you ineligible to use our service. Please try again after these are paid."</p>
<p>Sure, I'm talking bollocks it'll never happen - but the ABILITY both technically and socially would be there....</p>
<hr>
<p>(Funny thought - that footballer who swiped the Coke away and replaced it with water on the interview desk last week?           <br>
He made Coke's stock prices drop a bit. Imagine if they had influence on his COVID Passport Social credit score. Coke lobbying is millions/billions over the years... I'm sure they'd show the government that they need such influence - to stop people maliciously damaging their brand name. We're talking business, millions of dollars - serious stuff! That can't be allowed to happen!</p>
<p>Imagine our social lives being controlled by the companies we work for, that we buy from, that pollute our waters, steal our waters, produce CO2, kill the lakes, cut down the forests, that keep our wages FAR below our productivity......  meanwhile the TV blames us for buying "Too much stuff" to fill our empty, over controlled, over policed, shell of a life?</p>
<p>It's like we arrive at the dystopia in the Black Mirror Episode..... "The Waldo Moment"...... (worth a watch!). but by a different route.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waldo_Moment</p>
<p>How do we dig ourselves out of such a cohesive control system?
We probably can't. It would be global. Our best chance is by avoiding that path in the first place!</p>
<p>Something each one of us here instinctively understands, if not rationally.
