        <p>Agreed.</p>
<p>I would imagine that the OP of that post is a mod or friends with a mod. It certainly does not fit the mold for this subreddit. I am all about free speech and welcome his opinion, but pinning it at the top of the subreddit clearly is not agreed with by the members and if this were a free organization it would not be pinned there. But...</p>
<p>This is Reddit. Our little club here was literally compromised from the moment it was created, irregardless if there’s a plant mod or two. This is Reddit aka China aka a false narrative on society and the world where wrong opinions and uncomfortable facts are brushed out of existence like they’re Leon Trotsky allowing the narrative to be what they choose.</p>
<p>It won’t be long until Reddit gets rid of this subreddit and plenty of us as well. I promise you.</p>
<p>Edit: I replied before reading the comments. They’re awesome!</p>

        <p>Everyone I have spoken to other than the guy who did it was shocked by it.  I unpinned it for now and can't imagine how the discussion will go in any way to determine it was appropriate.  Anyways, I realize we are all skeptical here by nature so I probably can't say anything to reassure anyone because it was so out of left field.  It sucks to damage the trust relationship like this regardless.  I'm happy to try to field any questions though.</p>

        <p>The thing is. You shouldn’t be the one fielding questions (don’t get me wrong I appreciate it), but at this point you’re trying to do damage control. The questions need to go to the one who thought telling people to take a vaccine with no medical knowledge and making it a damn STICKY was appropriate</p>

        <p>Sure.  I just like this sub and want to reassure people there isn't some weird stuff going down at least that I am aware of.  I'm sure we will have some follow up with with a new policy at least but the inability to read the room per se is kind of a head scratcher for all of us so hopefully I can provide more clarity on that as well.</p>

        <p>Makes sense. And it does help that someone from the team is trying to clean up rather than backing them up or staying back publicly and only criticizing in private. </p>

        <p>That's good.  I've just personally been obsessed with all of this stuff from day 1 as I was a part of the first places in America to lockdown so I take it pretty seriously I guess, probably more than is healthy.</p>

        <p>Yep.  I just happen to make plans for that very thing. I was walking by a different downtown area the other day and was just struck by how insane it was having everyone on the sidewalks all masked up and scared with the streets blocked off with all these outdoor dining pens right in the middle of the road with everyone trying to have a good time and enjoy themselves.  I need to get out of the city!</p>

        <p>For real. I live in a red state but a blue county (one of the largest metropolitan areas in the US) and it sucks ass from dealing with work to just trying to go to the store. I don’t even go out much anymore because I refuse to wear my mask unless I absolutely have to. </p>

        <p>I go to China all the time. At this point if you have a smartphone or social media there’s a file on you and China has access to it. I’m not gonna live my life in fear of not speaking my voice. I’m fortunate and can do that because I have the money to do that. If the day ever comes that your nightmare scenario occurs I am well prepared to deal with anyone dumb enough to come try and get me. I might go somewhere but a lot of them are going with me.</p>

        <p>I just dug back into my old comments I see it was finally un-stickied. </p>
<p>I’m not gonna ask you to publicly agree or disagree with me as I understand your position, and no disrespect to you, but you all need to set rules amongst the mod group as to what qualifies a sticky. If someone wants to voice an opinion, fine, but don’t grandstand where you know you aren’t welcome (not you. The other mod)</p>

        <p>Totally.  We have had a pretty free-form approach up until this point.  I had previously stickied the Great Barrington Declaration (per a user's request) which was removed by somebody else and I didn't make a big deal about it because I assumed we were just trying to refrain from official positions so it was extra surprising to see this.
I thought he Barrington Declaration was basically like a manifesto that pretty much all of us can agree upon so I thought that made sense to sticky myself.  But yeah, it's clear that we need to set up rules/guidelines on what we will be doing moving forward.</p>
<p>I basically am reluctant to have any type of opinion or position that would be contentious. Maybe having us refrain from any type of position as mods would be good, I don't know.  Based on what just happens that at least seems like the safest move for now at least.</p>
<p>People are welcome to give their opinions as I want to make this community driven as much as possible.
I have a lot of strong opinions on many things but I think it's important to separate that from mod functions as I have practically never had to distinguish any comments because I am just enjoying the discussion everyone like everyone else most of the time.</p>

        <p>I don’t think you all should be restricted from voicing opinions because your mods. You’re still members of the sub. Maybe something at the start of any comment from you guys “this is an opinion of the individual posting and not of the mods as a whole” something like that. </p>
<p>Or maybe a relevant sticky that says what you guys post as general comments should be treated as your own personal opinion and not an official stance unless specifically dictated otherwise. Y’all shouldn’t be restricted from saying how you feel, just that no one, mod or otherwise outta be grandstanding regardless of feelings, rank, or general consensus of the community</p>

        <p>I mean. On a personal level I get just wanting to sit back and watch. But if you’re wanting to join in, I don’t think your position should influence that so long as it’s understood it’s your personal opinion/reply and not an official one. </p>
<p>Idk it just seems like stuff that oughta be basic for any community. Everyone participates, and if there’s an official stance on something, then it’s clearly laid out so there’s no discrepancies</p>

        <p>Yeah.  I feel like this is like the only time I've needed to bust out the badge and I was even trying to PM people with stuff as opposed to put people on blast on the sub and most people seemed fine with that but one guy seemed pissed for me to do that so I'm not sure if that's appropriate either.</p>

        <p>I get not liking to have to use the badge but there’s a reason you have it in the first place. He did the same thing on his post that started this mess so you didn’t have much of an option. </p>
<p>It probably would’ve been much worse if you /hadn’t/ used it. When one person with authority does something like that, someone else at a minimum in the same position has to step in to correct it</p>
<p>EDIT:  yea I didn’t even think about that at first. He made that post with the badge instead of as a regular user. Something like that should’ve been made as a “mere user” and it probably woulda totally flown under the radar. That was deliberate on his part to grandstand.</p>

        <p>Yeah.  We are all victims to error of our own judgement some times.  It is just a bummer to have people asking the obvious questions.  I have always wanted this place as closest to free speech as possible and it's natural to have different opinions on things.  I don't want to have an echo chamber like the rest of reddit.  Many/most of us seem to be getting pushed away from a large part of reddit because of that problem so I don't just want to have the flip side of the coin.</p>
