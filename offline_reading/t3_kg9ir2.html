    <strong>After PROMISING to keep restaurants open until early January...</strong>
    <p><p>They’re shutting them down here in Ireland on December 30th because of a ‘worrying’ spike in cases. ‘Cases’ have been ‘spiking’ for ages now, yet the increase in deaths has never come. SIX PEOPLE died yesterday. Six. And the people around me, one of my parents for example, are blaming people for ‘not behaving’. Makes your stomach churn. Check out this video from the HSE: </p>

<p>Edit: lol they don’t even say ‘you could become seriously ill’ or anything like that, just ‘you could become exposed.’ They can’t even pretend it’s a threat, so why should we?</p></p>

        <p>Very, <em>very</em> interesting they're making these proportion-free mandates at the same time as neighbouring countries.</p>

        <p>It’s all so coordinated. Am disgusted by how my fellow Irish people have lost their love of freedom. If it’s our own government they’ll just roll right over.</p>

        <p>Some shower. Did you notice Mehole got these orders from Europe earlier this week.<br>
It poses such an immediate threat, gov is meeting up next Tuesday to discuss restrictions for 11 days time.</p>

        <p>Lmao. Little pissant forgot he’s the Taoiseach at one point - everyone knows Leo runs the show. They know damn well this isn’t a threat, they couldn’t even keep up the pretense in a 30 sec Twitter video. The only thing to fear, is the government. </p>
<p>Did you hear about the funeral breakout in Ramsgrange? People pissed because people came from abroad to attend a funeral. Empathy-lacking, victim-blaming, scum-sucking pricks. </p>
<p>Also, happy to see another Irish person on this sub. We’re underrepresented on Reddit lol</p>

        <p>My father sometimes seems like he’s teetering on the edge. He showed me that meme pointing out the whole ‘flu disappeared bc we’re all abiding by measures, COVID is still around bc we’re flouting them’ paradox. I was so delighted on the inside! Sadly, he isn’t fully there yet. </p>
<p>My bets friend, however, is totally brainwashed. She has anxiety, and this just exacerbates it. I feel so bad for her - she sanitizes everything and told me just a few days ago that she feels I’m being reckless and endangering people by not doing so - she even sanitizes bloody radiators if she touches them. I pointed out that COVID is airborne so it’s pointless, and that all of the wipes being thrown away are just creating yet more waste building up. Nada. Zero change of thinking. </p>
<p>I was also thinking that (a) I’m LEGITIMATELY ‘immunocompromised’ due to Crohn’s meds, and I don’t want to weaken my immune system any more that I have to, and (b) that I’m immunocompromised, so if I did have it I’d be showing symptoms. </p>
<p>(I kind of suspect I may have had it during last winter, but we’ll never know.)</p>
<p>Kind of feel like being an asshole sometimes, and pointing out that by supporting this lockdown crap, she’s supporting the rise in child marriages. “A little girl is being violently raped somewhere right now, and it’s b e c a u s e o f y o u”. I wouldn’t ever say that, but man, when I see her sanitizing everything do I want to. </p>
<p>I want to clarify that she’s genuinely one of the few doomers actually driven by empathy, however misplaced.</p>

        <p>Reality has really taken a break in Ireland. Just copped your username lol. We you on freefolk at any stage? I think the season 8 reaction there was actually a precursor to the online doomer rage this year.</p>

        <p>She was fully prepped to meet up for a meal over XMAS. I asked if she’d be comfortable sitting in close quarters, masks off, and she said yeah, ‘as long as the government said it was safe’. Inwardly. I was just bowled over by her lack of fight. Not normally like her, it’s unsettling.</p>
