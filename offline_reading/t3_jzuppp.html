    <strong>The scariest thing of all?</strong>
    <p><p>Second post for the night but felt like sharing some worries...<br>
I think we might reach a point in the next few decades of no return...<br>
see how easy was to make people wear masks...and even if some see through the bs they had to wear them in order to buy groceries and etc...<br>
will be way harder to push the vaccines and im not taking one no matter what happens...but chances are the majority will get the shot...<br>
Why do people comply tho...its because they are told its for the greater good and the health of their fellow humans....now we're heading into the real sketchy stuff<br>
''Put this chip in ur brain to ensure a safer world with less crime" or some sht like that...That would be the end imo...for probably ever for real wtf. that would suck...Imagine people blindly buying the brain implants when being told its for the gReAtEr GoOd....Not being able to use plains or go to concerts without a chip...<br>
If im not mistaken Klaus's Covid The great reset book has parts where he explains people eventually might have to be literally thought policed through some sort of brain chip i imagine in order to fly on a plane to ensure the safety of the others...honestly wtf.......Im writing this while questioning is this real life or some insane dream im a bout to wake up from...Already had a lot of issues in my personal life...now I cant even look forward to a better future...<br>
So yeah...the scariest thing of it all is probably mandatory brain implants...</p>
<p>PS- anybody got a time machine to spare? Feel like goin few thousand years in the past</p></p>

        <p>Century of the Self was the beginning, for me https://m.youtube.com/results?search_query=Century+of+the+self+full . You can go for the 4 hour binge or digest it in parts.</p>
<p>As a side-ish note, I highly recommend the Tentacle Croissant channel on YouTube https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCFHaCjqbt5xz8L-pQnLY92A . They get into a great deal of philosophy and psychology. The videos where they role play being aliens looking down on humans is entertaining, and informative. Richard—the guy with the accent— is an NLP, life coach, historian that I’ve been following on his main channel for years.</p>

        <p>ive really been through that this year, felt like ending it all, now im actually so hopeful, people i would never expect actually waking up, saying what is going on, it doesnt make sense, as if theyd been under a spell, and they absolutely have, we all have, but alot of people are waking up, and theres just no going back now</p>
