    <strong>My university has only had 5 cases all semester and it’s NOT because students are following guidelines</strong>
    <p><p>For some background, I go to a school of around 3000 students. My uni was one of the last to shut down last year in late March because they could not afford to refund housing. As a result of this, the majority of students caught coronavirus but did not know they had it until later. The rest caught it over the summer. There were NO deaths, and NO hospitalizations. The only students I know of that haven’t had it are the foreigners that had strict lockdowns in their home countries. </p>
<p>Back in early August, the school said if we shut down they will not refund housing, and all students have to live on campus unless they have a serious condition that puts them at risk. They put in place an insane amount of rules and guidelines, and students had to sign a pledge allowing the school to “punish in whatever way seems fit” for breaking these guidelines. </p>
<p>No one has been following guidelines behind closed doors. Students have been going out of town, going to bars, and even traveling on planes (they said large gatherings and traveling was “strictly forbidden”). Even some administration has been out at the bars and the professors make comments in class about the ridiculousness of it all. Only 5 students have tested positive this year, and all are from Europe and were asymptomatic.</p>
<p>A few weekends ago, a large group of students (including myself) went to a local bar, like we had been all semester. The bar posted about the students thanking us for saving their business, but the school saw it and quarantined everyone they identified. </p>
<p>It is now week 3 and we are still in quarantine even though no one tested positive or showed symptoms. We also have to do community service hours, write an apology to the other students for potentially exposing them, and if we are caught breaking any guidelines again we will be expelled. The school also sent out a series of emails insinuating that we were all sick so now there are rumors of us starting an outbreak, but there are currently no positive cases among anyone on campus (and we even have random required testing). They even alluded to shutting down again if we can’t “behave” - with no refund for housing... hmmm.</p>
<p>Not only are we being treated like children, but I am SO sick of missing out on my final year of college for a virus that is not a big deal for freaking healthy college students. We’re not even putting our families at risk because they forced us to live on campus!! The whole situation makes me mad. The school just wants our money and is abusing their power. If you’re that scared of the goddamn virus stay home and let people mind their own business.</p></p>

<p>Would this be considered libel/slander?</p>

        <p>They sent an updated email a few days after clarifying that it was “just a possibility” that we started an outbreak and that there were no actual cases but they wanted us to see the risks</p>

        <p>The university had a don’t ask don’t tell policy but it was discussed online and there will be scapegoats for making them look like they aren’t doing their jobs. </p>
<p>I consider it criminal the way unis are treating their customers.</p>
