    <strong>Coronavirus in Finland</strong>
    <p><p>I think the majority of people here are from USA and I don't know how many of you know or are interested of the corona situation in Finland. But at least in Europe Finland is seen as one the most succesful countries fighting coronavirus or at least we are told approximately weekly how other countries admire us and our prime minister. (Please from where ever you are, is this true? Is It well known in UK, Germany  USA, Portugal, Estonia etc...what is the situation in Finland and do you know who is the prime minister here...)</p>
<p>Well, it started here in the beginning of 2020 the same way as everywhere else. We read the news and heard of this respiratory infection in Wuhan and were told from the authorities that it is not relevant at all  this new virus isn't a threat at all. But in the end of January the news exploded! A chinese tourist from Wuhan who was visiting Lapland had gone to health care center because of respiratory symptoms! The panic started. People were angry and demanded we ban the visits of chinese tourists here. The health care officers told us not to worry, we were told that coronavirus infection is not a serious disease (you can still find these statements in couple of seconds just googleing) and we should be more worried of flu and common cold.</p>
<p>Well, the chinese woman didn't have coronavirus. Actually I don't remember which was the first case of coronavirus in Finland. But by March there was panic again. People hoarding toilet paper and you know, the stuff that happened everywhere. The streets were empty  restaurants closed, also the schools were closed etc etc, the same shit that happened everywhere. We were also told by health care officers and the government we should NOT start wearing masks. On several occasions that was askel and we were told NO. We were explained thst is psratically impossible to use a mask in a way it wouldn't actually act as a source of infection. And we were also told there is no prove of benefits of masks.</p>
<p>In the spring we had max approximately 280 patients in hospital because of cotonavirus infection snd max 75 of them in the ICU and this was for a very short time only. (The population of Finland is 5,5 million.) Appr. 300 people died during spring. The age of the deceased was about 84 years and 80% of the dead were not transferred to hospital at all because of their other health concerns (severe dementia etc).</p>
<p>The summer was easier. The restaurants and even bars were open, with some limitations.</p>
<p>In the fall we were told to start using masks. It even caused a scandal when it was found out thst the health care officials would've recommended them already in the spring but our government told them not to do that. Big headlines in the papers about that but somehow it was forgotten and we were told to use masks. Also they limited the bars and restaurants again. The rules are so complicated I truly can not remember them, I only remember it is prohibited to serve alcohol after 10 pm and by 11 pm the bar/restaurant has to be empty and closed. I live in Helsinki (the capital) and in our area the restriction are the most strict but there has been some severe restrictions in other cities/areas too "when needed". At the moment the theaters, opera, cinemas, museums, indoor swimming pools and who can remember what else are closed. Also the libraries. You are adviced to wear a mask in public transport, at shops etc.  At the moment we have 276 patients in hospital because of coronavirus and 28 of them in the ICU. In the area of Helsinki University Hospital (population 1,5 million) 10 patients in the ICU. Ten. And the whole country is about closed...</p>
<p>And we are subjected to propaganda and intimidation here. In the fall we were told to act good and be compliant so we would be allowed to have christmas. In todays newspaper there is  a headline with the message being "The way you behave now affects the way you are allowed to spend next summer". And yes, we are told the restrictions will probably continue at the least to the end of 2021 despite of vaccinations.</p>
<p>Oh my god, there is so much I'd like to write here but I'm getting tired! Please, ask and comment and I Will try to answer. And also I'm very interested in whst is happening in other parts of the World. (For example tha fact that the minks in Denmark were killed because of mutated coronavirus was in the news in here for 1-2 days, we were told these kind of mutations wouldn't be a problem/threat here (why not?) and after that the whole subject was forgotten.</p></p>

        <p>To me it seemed like Finland/Sanna were resisting the new normal narrative for a while that the rest of the world were pushing. Then suddenly she comes out with a pro-eu globalist article and suggests that vaccine certificates to enable travel are a good idea. </p>
<p>I live in Finland but don’t yet understand Finnish. The small town I live in has just carried on as normal for most of the year, I went to a circus in the summer and nobody wore a mask. It’s only in the last few months that the media have ramped up propaganda and scared people into wearing masks in shops, for most of the year I never saw a masked Finn. 
Last time I checked the death total from Covid in Finland was still nowhere near the 700 influenza deaths from winter 2018.</p>

        <p>And yes, 461 deaths, 80% of victims died outside of hospital (= too sick from other ilnesses for transfer / no prognosis), 20% (92 or 93 patients) deaths in hospital treated patients.</p>

        <p>Here in the center of Helsinki I think 80-90% of people wear masks. Maybe 90% inside and 80% also  outside while walking the dog in a park etc. I truly hope I'd live somewhere else, only moved to Helsinki a couple of years ago.</p>

        <p>US here. I never heard anything about Finland, only constantly conflicting information about Sweden. They're doing great one day. They're all gonna die the next. Ridiculous.</p>

        <p>In Finland we are told almost daily that the situation in Sweden is catastrophic. At the moment I think it is difficult, but we have been told it is a disaster since spring. Our headlines are screaming this November was  the second worst November of Swedens history measured in the number of deaths. And yes it was. The worst was the year of spanish flu, 1918. (November 1918: 16600 deaths, population 5.8 million, November 2020: 8088 deaths, population 10,5 million).</p>

        <p>Today a bishop is telling in the headlines that it is the duty of a Christian to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>I'm not by no means antivaxx but I consider it very weird that a spokesman of church comments something like this.</p>

        <p>And in Helsingin Sanomat, the biggest newspaper in Finland, there is a report of the coronavirus with a poll showing that 77% of the participants see the pandemic as a good/beneficial thing.</p>

        <p>I live in Joensuu (I am non-native), it is weird that around October nearly no one wore masks and when November-December came, I saw some recommendation billboards, and boom, everyone went crazy for some reason. I believe that media is quite powerful in situations like that.</p>
