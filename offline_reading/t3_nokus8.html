    <strong>I thought this was very appropriate to now.</strong>
    <p><p>I know how alone you must feel and how it feels when it seems the entire world is against you, because I do to. I often feel like there is hardly anyone sane left the world, and that alone is enough to drive the remaining sane people INsane. But even when everyone tries to tell you how crazy you are because you're not like them, you have to remember that you don't need their approval. Why would you? Look at them. They wear diapers on their faces and cower in their homes. What they think of you is not important compared to the other problems we have right now. Don't let them get to you. </p>
<p>A movie that I've turned to many times during this idiocy is Dead Poets Society. It is full of great scenes and messages that are very relevant to now, about rejecting conformity, finding your own voice, and seizing the day. One of the things that angers me most about this situation, and believe me, there are a lot of things, is how they are trying to keep us from doing just that. Many people right now are in their youth, what is supposed to be the time of their lives, and it's going to waste because of this tyranny. </p>
<p>There are so many great scenes from this movie, but here is a great one about conformity. </p>

        <p>I woke up crying thinking about lost time and opportunities, and I'm in my 50s. I think it's worse for the young. How are they going to date and build lives or make memories in their youth? my youth was not easy, but at least I could go to concerts, the park and explore and do things. This is insane.</p>

        <p>My dad keeps saying how it was worse in the fifties, but I just don't see how (yes, I know how bad some things were). At least they weren't forced to wear a diaper on their faces and life as they knew it didn't change. They could go anywhere they wanted and socialize with whomever they wanted.</p>

        <p>I will never conform.</p>
<p>I drink and drive because I know that there is no science behind slower reflexes preventing crashes. Of course I dont get blitzed but I can definitely drive buzzed just fine. I mean the fines for POTENTIALLY hurting someone??? Are you freaking kidding me??? Wheres our freedom?</p>

        <p>I know you are trying to be funny, but are actually right in a way. The reduction of reflex speed in a 20 year old at 'intoxicated' level is still faster than the speed of a 60 year old cold sober.</p>
<p>Not to speak of how much faster than a tired driver. But driving tired or on medications is fine!</p>
