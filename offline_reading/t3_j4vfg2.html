    <strong>What’s up free breathers</strong>
    <p><p>Just wanted to say hi to my peeps! Just found this subreddit and am thankful to finally find educated well spoken people like myself (masters in mathematics btw) to talk to. I am so done with this pandemic, like what’s the big deal? I think doomers are all just a bunch of sissy girls. Well I just wanted to say hi. Please comment below with your education background and thoughts on the pandemic.</p></p>

        <p>so called 'education' is not indicative of intelligence</p>
<p>all of the paid covid 'experts' are 'educated' and 'credentialed'</p>
<p>how's that working out?</p>

        <p>You’re right - but I’m not sure why you’re taking your resentment at experts out on u/scoopdidywhoop ... when anti-lockdown people are regularly painted as stupid, ignorant grandma killers, he’s naturally excited to have found people who share his views and are <em>NOT</em> stupid, ignorant grandma killers. </p>
<p>Education is in no way indicative of intelligence, but it also does not necessarily mean formal education. </p>
<p>Views about covid and lockdowns and masks <em>should</em> be educated views. Anyone with a brain and the interest can educate themself on the relevant information. An intelligent person who forms conclusions without first learning the relevant information - aka becoming <em>educated</em> - is not so much “intelligent” as they are “stupid and ignorant.”</p>

        <p>&rt; not sure why you’re taking your resentment at experts out on </p>
<p>where in my 3 sentence reply did i 'take out my resentment at (of) experts' on the OP?</p>
<p>i am careful not to use words or phrases haphazardly. these modern english words 'educate', 'education' and 'educated' are both misused and misunderstood.</p>
<p>depending on which of the 2 latin root words is used, the definition of 'educate' is changed dramatically </p>
<p>"educare" means to train or mold, while "educere' means to draw out from within or to lead forth.</p>
<p>these are two completely different concepts. "One calls for rote memorization and becoming good workers. The other requires questioning, thinking, and creating."</p>
<p>while i don't know what definition of 'educated' OP intended, he does point to his formal 'masters in math' and then goes on to request repliers of their 'education background'... why? what's the motive there?</p>
<p>appeal to authority or experts are logical fallacies, as is appeal to emotion, among many others.</p>
<p>for my part, i have no formal 'education' (training/molding) whatsoever, not even a high school diploma. so what? what difference does it make when it comes to opposing 'the new normal'? i was no fan of 'the old normal'.</p>

        <p>A Doctor of Science here, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland. Obviously, the pandemic is not about the virus anymore, it is about the reaction of a median individual. The virus is real, but only a bit more dangerous than the influenza virus. The cure has become worse than the disease. Needless to say, the public reaction is completely out of proportion. Unfortunately, the media loves to feed the fear to the common folk.</p>
<p>The only thing I can do, is not to take any part of it. Zero seconds, is the accumulated time that I have worn a mask. Universal masking does nothing but keeps the mass hysteria alive.</p>

        <p>Currently a film student. We learn a ton about behaviour and media manipulation,  which we’re seeing a lot of right now. So nice of you to join us. </p>
<p>I think this pandemic is a major overreaction and we need to take note of the success Sweden is having and also the fact that their media doesn’t try to fear monger like they do over here in (Canada, the US and Europe as well as anywhere else they may be exaggerating precautions.) and just live our lives.</p>
