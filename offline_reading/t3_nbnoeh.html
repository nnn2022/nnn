    <strong>Is anyone else scared for their grandparents because they got the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Last Sunday my grandma said she would have a vaccination appointment on Monday of this week. I never cry in front of her or anyone really but I broke down and she said my grandpa would get it too on Wednesday (so yesterday) and she said they would be fine. I told her no and asked her why she would get it after all the thousand points I gave to her a few weeks back. </p>
<p>She said because she and my grandpa "didn't want to lose their rights" and because they "wanted to do things outside in the future" I explained it doesn't work like that. She couldn't give any other points and she didn't look sure of her decision either so what the fuck. The discussion ended in nothing and now they're both fucking vaccinated. </p>
<p>On that day I also heard my mom talk to her about how an old teacher of her died one week after vaccination and another guy in a village of a friend of hers who also died shortly after being vaccinated after having a heart attack. </p>
<p>I can't believe my grandparents would be this gullible. They're usually genuinely smart people. I'm absolutely lost. Yes I know it's their decision but what the fuck</p></p>

        <p>I'm so very grateful that my own family has been awake to the BS since the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>However, my husband is not nearly as lucky. His father just informed us the other day that he got the vaxx because "his work is gonna require it at some point". This is someone who one week ago was going off about how he wasn't gonna get it unless his job required him to.</p>
<p>His job didn't require it and he still went and got it, despite husband and I both being very vocal about how this vaxx is nothing but bad bad news.</p>
<p>His father has a conglomeration of health issues: obesity, type 2 diabetes, gout, and everything else that comes with being extremely overweight.</p>
<p>I'm concerned that this upcoming winter, he's going to catch some other coronavirus and his body will not be able to adapt to fight it off. This has been a proven issue with mRNA "vaccines", and what has happened in animal trials back in like 2013: once encountering a wild type of a similar virus to whatever they were injected to defend against, the body CANNOT adapt to fight the variations in disease.</p>
<p>It kills your immune system's ability to learn and adapt. This is proven, there are multiple research papers that can be found with such information.</p>
<p>I'm very sorry to hear about your grandparents. The best thing they can do at this point is take vitamin D and make sure to support their immune system as much as they can, and hopefully not pick up anything. And hopefully they don't suffer any side affects from the injection itself.</p>

        <p>I understand and I’m sorry. I cried over my family. They think I’m crazy and just another conspiracy theorist. I hate this world, it really is becoming painful to exist.</p>

        <p>tell them to check the CDCs latest guidance (like just now)</p>
<p>as of now, there’s no way to verify status, they should be fine.</p>

        <p>Not my grandparents but elderly clients. The gentleman suffered a stroke years ago so he is in rough shape and just got out of the hospital because he couldn't pee, just got his first shot a couple weeks ago, I'm so scared for him and his wife to get the 2nd shot..</p>
