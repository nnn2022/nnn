    <strong>Brace Yourselves. Winter Is Coming.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm predicting a surge in "Covid" deaths this winter; whether this will be from the flu (or any of the other usual culprits behind the increase in deaths during every single winter season) or the vaccines is anyone's guess at this point, but one thing I can tell you for certain is that the blame will be laid at our doorstep like a bag of flaming dog-shite. The unvaccinated will be crucified by the media, as the vaccines fail to do what they're supposed to do (we've already seen countless cases of this happening) or a new vArIAnT(!!!) from France or Latvia or fucking Mars will circumvent the vaccines.</p>
<p>We're going to be lulled into a false sense of security within the next few months as restrictions ease and lockdowns lift but DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS. We passed the threshold of the "dangerous precedent" fucking ages ago. These fuckers know they can get away with this shit now and they can implement lockdowns and social distancing just by breathing the word "pandemic". I don't know about the rest of you, but a long time is going to have to pass before the looming threat of having our lives upended at a moment's notice disappears for me.</p>
<p>Even now that fucking melting hippo Boris is saying he's "anxious" about the super contagious quintuple mutant Indian variant spreading, casting doubts on whether all restrictions will lift in June. The goalposts are constantly in motion. Whatever arbitrary date they choose can and will be moved. Our only hope is that the taste of freedom we're given for the next couple months will prove strong enough to most people that they fight back against it next time they decide to fuck us in the ass with a furlough reacharound. Otherwise we're going to be blamed, shamed and maimed for the next round of "Covid" deaths.</p></p>

        <p>I live in Michigan. The mask mandate for vaccinated people was just lifted as of this morning, and the mask mandate for everybody expires on July 1. We're supposed to be happy about this, but I'm not.</p>
<p>My governor and my university (I'm a grad student) shut my life down for 15 months over a virus that I've beaten twice now. Now I'm just supposed to pretend this authoritarianism didn't go on and be happy about lockdowns being lifted? No way. I don't buy that they're gone for good and won't be reinstated because of the winter months, or because the vaccine isn't as effective as they thought, or because not "enough" people are getting the vaccine. I'm not going through this shit again, so I will be moving out toward the end of the summer and going to TX or FL.</p>
<p>Need to find a way to explain this to my supervisor (who's busy AF and pretty hands-off anyway) without mentioning politics or that I haven't gotten the vaccine. Still working on that one.</p>

        <p>Same here, partner said Florida was too far so Texas it is. Her school here in California is all virtual now because she doesn't know when they'll decide to force in person to have the vaccine or if she'll get any warning. So, I'm moving to a cheaper place that's 1/3 the rent in TX, fixing my credit and she'll just stay in her mom's spare room for the workweek. Sounds so ridiculous but I feel like time is running out and I don't want it to be too late...I can't believe it's even come to this, we were going to move in a couple years after her bachelor's was done.</p>

        <p>Thirded. Florida is my end goal too, but I can relocate to a considerably freer state under pretty short notice. Hell, if things get too crazy, I can literally walk or bike across the state line and live as hobo refugee until I get things sorted out.</p>
<p>My point is I <em>DO NOT</em> want to be in this muzzle-worshipping hellhole when the S starts to really HTF when/if the experimental mRNA gene therapy starts slaughtering the sheep in droves. </p>
<p>Exactly the point OP was making. I've been a member of a minority of some kind literally every second of my life, just not of a particularly scapegoated one. I <em>REALLY</em> don't want to start being so during a mass casualty crisis.</p>

        <p>I agree.  So much effort has been put into this whole thing it's crazy to think it just "fizzles out", or that there arent at least several backup plans to deal with whatever happens.</p>
<p>It might just be our fast-food minds and short attention spans, but it seems we expect this to play out over a 1-year timeline. </p>
<p>Whoever is up there has certainly mapped out the next 2, or 5, or 10 years with brilliant behavioural scientists and other strategists. They have thought of every alternative and contingency over years of preparation.</p>
<p>And they have planned for the "long game".</p>

        <p>They're not "like" a cult at this point, they <em>are</em> one, which is why the whole "unvaccinated people caused the spike in Covid deaths" narrative they're going to push this winter will succeed.
