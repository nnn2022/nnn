    <strong>Father in law won’t see my wife unless she’s vaccinated. Seeking advice.</strong>
    <p><p>He’s in his sixties, and he has drank the covid cool-aid big time. He insists we be vaccinated before he will see us, and that is a complete non-starter. We are going to discuss it through email. </p>
<p>I’m asking for help with credible, reputable sources to persuade him of the dangers and inefficacy of the vaccine, as well as the overblown nature of the covid hype.</p>
<p>If any of you fine people can point me toward something concise and effective i would he grateful.</p>
<p>Edit: something I forgot to mention is that he has a young son from a second wife who is thankfully, still unvaccinated and as a secondary objective, I would very much like to keep it that way.</p></p>

        <p>Covinfo Data Dump:-</p>
<p>The following is a collection of useful/interesting data on the the Covid19 vaccines and potential alternative treatments:</p>
<p>Academic Articles:</p>
<p>Journal article from 2004 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine:
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2004/12/sars-vaccine-linked-liver-damage-ferret-study</p>
<p>Journal article from 2005 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15755610/</p>
<p>Journal article from 2005 shows evidence that sars-cov1 vax caused ADE when subjects were challenged with different strain:
https://www.nature.com/articles/news050110-3#ref-CR1</p>
<p>Journal article from 2012 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421</p>
<p>Journal article from 2020 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov vaccine (can't figure out if they're talking about cov1 or 2):
https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/22/12672.abstract</p>
<p>Journal article from 2020 explains why immune disorders happen with covid vax, because human and Covid19 proteins are similar:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589909020300186 </p>
<p>Article explaining how ADE works in Sar-cov1:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8</p>
<p>Article explaining the potential for ADE in Covid19:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8</p>
<p>Another article that speculates on the potential for ADE in Covid19:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32920233/</p>
<p>Article from 2021 explains that there is evidence that covid19 is able to kill macrophages by using antibody dependent mechanisms:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432407v1 </p>
<p>Article on how the Covid19 spike protein crosses the blood-brain barrier:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096999612030406X?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>Japanese article on how the Pfizer vax is associated with brain hemorrhaging (lending credence to the hypothesis that the spike proteins are crossing the blood brain barrier in some people):
https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40545-021-00326-7</p>
<p>Article on how AstraZeneca is associated with blood clots in the brain (lending more credence to the hypothesis that the spike proteins are crossing the blood brain barrier in some people):
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104840</p>
<p>Pfizer animal testing document that was obtained by Dr. Byram Bridle through a FOI request to the Japanese government which shows the biodistribution of the lipid-nano particles throughout the bodies and organs of the test subjects. This is evidence that the lipid nanoparticles do not stay in the injecton site, but instead travel all throughout the body (go to pg 16/23 for the charts showing biodistribution over the course of 48hrs):
https://files.catbox.moe/0vwcmj.pdf</p>
<p>Addendum to the above link. This blog post provides easy to understand information (with pictures) on the make-up of the lipid nanoparticles used in the Covid19 vaccines. It shows that the pharmaceutical companies could have designed them to have targeting ligands on the outside, so that the nanoparticles would only transfect the muscle cells. But instead the vax was designed with PEG polymers on the outside, so that the immune system will not be able to pick them up and put them in the trash. The PEG is what Byram Bridle says is the reason the vaccine travels throughout the body and since it does not have targeting ligands, it can transfect any type of cell:
https://www.cas.org/resource/blog/understanding-nanotechnology-covid-19-vaccines</p>
<p>Article with evidence that spike proteins do end up circulating in the blood, when they're not supposed to, they're supposed to be anchored on the cell membranes:
https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab465/6279075</p>
<p>More evidence that spike proteins do not stay on the cell membranes but end up circulating in the blood. This study aims to explain the blood clots caused by the J&amp;J and AstraZeneca adenovector vaccines, they claim that the DNA isn't properly spliced and the spike protiens end up in the blood causing thrombosis when the spikes attach to the ACE2 receptors of the endothelial cells:
https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-558954/v1</p>
<p>Article on how the spike protein can cause neurodegeneration:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X2100499X?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>Journal article with evidence that the spike protein by itself can damage cells by binding to ACE2, causing the cells mitochondria to lose their shape and break apart:
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318902</p>
<p>Article on how the spike protein in vaccines can cause cell damage:

<p>Evidence of cov2 immune escape:
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/06/30/science.abi7994</p>
<p>Article from 2015 that explains how imperfect vaccination (like the Pfizer and moderna that require at least two shots to be effective) can create immune escape variants:
https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198</p>
<p>Article explains how vaccine manufacturers have used relative risk reduction to determine that vaccine efficacy is ~90+%, however they should have used absolute risk reduction which would tell us that the vaccines will only reduce total covid cases by ~1%:

<p>Addendum to the above link. OpenVAERS is a site that allows you to easily read VAERS reports and breaks down the numbers. The reports seem to be a lot of people who have comorbidities or are old, but there are also some really eye opening cases where young people experience horrible side effects. Read for yourself and make up your own mind about what the vax is doing to your fellow Americans:

        <p>This is the true tragedy that we are all experiencing right now.  I'm watching our small community fracturing in front of my eyes.  We have everyone across the spectrum - knowing and refusing, compliant, vaccinated to do their part, to the ones that have become so manic that they shout anyone down, inform them the unvaccinated are not welcome, that they are killing everyone, their responsible for the outbreaks.  I have mourned them all preemptively.  One neighbor I adore, but is in full acceptance of the narrative appeared over the weekend with a yellow and purple bruise emanating from her armpit to the inside of her elbow with no explanation and the vein in the middle of her arm is swollen.  She said it's painful, but a pain she's never experienced before.  Super healthy, young, and now has to nap everyday due to unexplained exhaustion.  At my urging, she had it looked at over the weekend at Urgent Care, but they could offer no explanation.  She was able to hear my concern and reasoning for it, but cannot accept anything beyond that.</p>
<p>My rambling point is, I don't think there is any one thing or point of evidence that you can deliver to someone that will change their mind at this point.  Yes, you could lie and buy a little time, but depending on where you are - should there be a dinner out where proof is required, then you've run out of options.  Stand your ground.  And know you are not alone. This is turning.  There might come a point in the near future where they can no longer deny the adverse reactions, the deaths, and you father in law might find himself thankful that she didn't get it.  Stand your ground.  You are not alone.</p>

<p>I'm starting to think that perhaps there are no credible or reputable sources of information against the vax, or proving that C19 is itself a hoax. All us sheep have been lied to by Tucker, and OAN, and InfoWars, sounds unbelievable, I know.</p>
