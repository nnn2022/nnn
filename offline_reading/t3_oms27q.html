    <strong>The head of the Social Democrats, part of the government coalition, feels "uncomfortable" when people who have been fully vaccinated hug on the street. She also speaks about new curfews in the future and the cancellation of all major events - because children can not be vaccinated.</strong>
    <p><p>The Head of the SPD, the second largest party in Germany and part of the government, just gave an interview with a few shocking statements. Ok, they were only shocking if you are a conspiracy theorist who thinks you will get your freedom back some day, but still... </p>
<p>During this interview Saskia Esken said:</p>
<p>&rt;I also see it with discomfort that people who have been vaccinated twice fall  around their necks on the street. Everyone wants normality, but nothing is normal for those who cannot be vaccinated. I now expect solidarity with our children and teenagers</p>
<p>So you should better not hug again each other, or you are a really bad person because 3 year old kids can not be vaccinated. Maybe we should implement some sort of Sharia Law and sent out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guidance_Patrol">Guidance Police</a>? </p>
<p>She also talked about the curfews we had here before</p>
<p>&rt;Esken also does not rule out a nationwide curfew: â€œThe curfew was issued because it has proven to be effective in some federal states. But we always have to design the measures in such a way that they are proportionate. "</p>
<p>So back to curfews if the Incidence will rise above 100 i guess. They have never proven to be effective by the way. But sometimes facts are not wanted if they beat your ideology.</p>
<p>She also talked about Major Events, like stadium visits, festivals and so on.</p>
<p>&rt;"We must not allow major events at which the hygiene rules cannot be implemented." As long as there is no general vaccination for children and teenagers, one must continue to be considerate.</p>
<p>As stadium visits, festivals and so on are COMPLETELY impossible to do with "hygiene rules" it means nothing else that she wants them to get banned for as long as children can not be vaccinated. Which can be forever of course.</p>

        <p>Continuing with the psyop. No one should be surprised. Keeping people in a constant state of control, fear and panic. They are desperate to push this through and get that passport set up so the world is in its way to being completely digitalized. If people don't see this by now, that it's not about "covid" it's about using that to get people loaded into a digital platform and change all of the world's currency system and our overall way of life ... I don't know what to say.</p>
