        <p>Yet all the vaccine worshippers are claiming all of these reports are unrelated to the jab- or at least better than all those people getting covid. People are so brain dead. These numbers are low considering most aren’t reported thanks to their doctors telling them it’s unrelated- or they’re told the reaction is normal.</p>

        <p>For clarification, about 10% of that is covid. Of course, that's still 10% of all vaccine injuries ever in just a few months. This brings me to two conclusions. First, the covid vaccines are the most dangerous consumer product in history. Anything else would have been pulled not just by now but within days or weeks at most. Second, we need to reconsider the concept that vaccines in general are safe. For the past few decades, manufacturers in the US have been exempt from liability because they do not want to accept the risk.</p>

        <p>But that’s not the way this systems works. The numbers you’re seeing here are from VAERS, which is a system of self-volunteered, physician, and clinic-reported health incidents from people that have gotten a vaccine within a certain timeline. But an “adverse event” doesn’t need to be related to the vaccine. <em>Any</em> adverse health incident can be reported and collected by this system.</p>
<p>None of these are even confirmed to be remotely linked to the vaccine. At all. It even says it right across the bottom of the screenshot.</p>
<p>Get a vaccine and a week later get diarrhea? Report it to VAERS. Rash? VAERS report. Doesn’t matter if you ate bad yogurt or had a reaction to your new laundry soap, often doctors will report it to VAERS just to see if any patterns arise in the numbers and symptoms and timelines.</p>
<p>&rt; As an early warning system, VAERS cannot prove that a vaccine caused a problem. Specifically, a report to VAERS does not mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event.

<p>OP gave us a screenshot and some numbers and nothing else. If you’re drawing the conclusion that this is the “most dangerous consumer product in history” off of that information, that’s… not great.</p>
<p>Vaccines are incredibly safe and effective. The only thing that needs rethinking is better distribution networks and patient education. There are too many people around the world that don’t have access to life-saving vaccines and many people convinced that there is some great evil behind them.</p>

        <p>Some of them are legit side effects, no doubt. Headaches, nausea, muscle soreness. But the “cardiac arrests” and serious issues are very few and far between, and therefore, are most likely coincidental or need more underlying context to make the vaccine association.</p>
<p>But I would agree, some of the serious health events are most likely coincidental.</p>

        <p>Can you post the link to it? This is a picture someone took of a screen with their phone…</p>
<p>Was this through the WONDER system on the CDC website, and if so - is this for all 3 Covid vaccines? There are a lot of filters that you need to apply before you start seeing numbers so I’m just curious if this is the whole pool or if there are any filters like geography, age, sex, etc. in play?</p>
<p>And, even then, are these numbers meaningful? Take a look:</p>
<p>&rt; VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of possible health problems—also called “adverse events”—after vaccination. As an early warning system, VAERS cannot prove that a vaccine caused a problem. <strong>Specifically, a report to VAERS does not mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event.</strong> But VAERS can give CDC and FDA important information. If it looks as though a vaccine might be causing a problem, FDA and CDC will investigate further and take action if needed.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Anyone can submit a report to VAERS — healthcare professionals, vaccine manufacturers, and the general public. VAERS welcomes all reports, regardless of seriousness, and regardless of how likely the vaccine may have been to have caused the adverse event.</strong></p>

<p>PFFFT as if people are going to all of the trouble to report adverse reactions and death for some arbitrary things to do out of boredom and/or making false reports knowing <strong>that a false report to VAERS is a violation of Federal law (18 U.S. Code § 1001) punishable by fine and imprisonment.</strong> Oh and let's not forget, otherwise perfectly healthy people dying and/or having heart attacks, blood clots immediately following the vaccine shot are all just 'coincidences' and therefore aren't 'true.' Suddenly out of nowhere VAERS just can't be trusted. GTFOH. What a load BULLSHIT.</p>

        <p>Read what the VAERS system is. It’s an early warning system, it encourages people to report any adverse health events they encounter during a certain timeline after receiving a vaccination. <em>It does not have to be related to the vaccine.</em> In fact, the CDC is very clear that VAERS reports are in no way connected to the vaccine(s), it is simply an aggregate of health conditions as a way to look for patterns and <em>potential</em> vaccine complications.</p>
<p>You could literally sprain your ankle, go to the doctor, and if you are in the vaccine time window, the doctor has to report the injury to VAERS. Just in case the vaccine caused dizziness or muscle spasms or something to that effect. If 30k people sprain their ankle in the same timeline after getting the same vaccine, that would spark some questions. Health-conscious people are encouraged to report <em>anything</em> adverse during the time window. But you’re right, making fraudulent reports is a punishable crime.</p>
<p>As for “perfectly healthy people dying/having blood clots immediately after having the vaccine” has happened so infrequently that they absolutely could be coincidence. That said, both J&amp;J and AstraZeneca have acknowledged those side effects, but come on - like 7 people getting blood clots doesn’t make it a deadly vaccine.</p>
<p>Anyway, are we trusting CDC numbers now? I thought they were inflated or fake? These numbers are real now?</p>

        <p>LOL why would I quote CNN in <em>this</em> subreddit? That’s absurd. Y’all wouldn’t be able to get past those three letters to even read the article. CNN is a credibility killer.</p>
<p>This what the CDC has to say:
&rt; More than 310 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through June 14, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 5,343 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. <strong>FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html">Reported Adverse Events</a></p>
<p>And this is what the WHO (World Health Organization) has to say:
&rt; Very rare thromboembolic events, in combination with thrombocytopenia, have been reported following vaccination with the J&amp;J vaccine in the United States. As of 7 May 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reviewed <strong>28 reports of TTS out of a total of more than 8 million vaccinations</strong>; TTS was reported in persons between 18-59 years of age (median age of 40 years) and occurring after 3-15 days (a median of 9 days).(2)  To date, the US FDA and CDC have not identified any cases of TTS after use of over 240 million doses of mRNA vaccines.</p>

Why not label all Covid vaccine the same way?</p>

        <p>Because 2 of the 3 vaccines are mRNA vaccines and one is not. They are different, they work
differently, and thus, potentially have different side effects and considerations.</p>
<p>I understand Covid has no filter, but lumping together health events across the 3 different vaccines is no way to judge their efficacy.</p>
<p>Aren’t you interested in the truth? Or does just haphazardly lumping together numbers to fit a narrative work for you?</p>

They lie about everything, from how many deaths from Covid, from "cases", to vaccine side effects, to if Tony Fauci is to blame direct or indirect for spreading this virus. They lie more than a politician in an election year.
Push and push lies for selling vaccines. The big guys earn trillions on this Covid over hyped nonsense.</p>

<p>I as a 100% believer in that this virus, whatever it is, if it's a flu, or Fauci's Gain of Function virus, that this virus don't affect me. And I don't care about your health, or anybody else.</p>
<p>If you worry about me infecting you with this over hyped cold virus, feel free to buy a Hazmat suit, and stay in your basement indefinitely. </p>
<p>Because this Plandemic isn't going to be over before all money is made, and every gullible person have signed up for the every 6 months subscription on vaccines. 
And when that's done, they make a new virus to scare you gullible with, making it a cocktail of vaccines.</p>

        <p>Why wouldn’t this virus affect you?</p>
<p>“They lie about everything” is kind of a cop-out, isn’t it? That sidesteps the burden of proof and let’s you just hand-wave away evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>So, you’re saying this virus was planned and it’s all a ploy to sell vaccines and milk the population of their money and agency? How could that many companies and scientists and government employees keep that a secret? I mean, that’s a huge operation, right? And it seems pretty risky with so many moving parts. What if it backfires? The margin for error seems pretty wide, and with the amount of people that would need to be involved, the risk vs reward isn’t really there. </p>
<p>And you said you don’t care about anyone else’s health? What <em>actual</em> responsibility do you think you have to society? Do you think you’re just entitled to exist and take advantage of the benefits of living in a society without putting work into it? Just, you know, do what you want without having to consider how your actions affect others?</p>
<p>Look, you’re subscribing to just as much propaganda as the people you’re railing against. None of what you just said can be supported by anything substantial or empirical or factual; otherwise, I assume I’d be staring at a wall of blue links to back up your claims. Instead, your positions are entirely emotional.</p>
<p>Which is fine, you’re absolutely entitled to your emotions and opinions. But society and science and facts are gonna go ahead and disagree with you, and probably exclude you because of it.</p>

        <p>Wow. You're really deep in it, aren't you?
If I may suggest, turn off the news on the TV, radio, and internet news. Facebook and the rest of them.
If you talk about propaganda, that's the ones you should worry about.</p>
<p>I'm probably unaffected by this and many other viruses, by not watch TV.
And maybe because as an "essential" worker, I have been in the middle every day, and never been sick, so I have learned, that "hey, I don't get sick from this".
I don't need media to tell me I'm sick or not.</p>
<p>Science and "facts" are bought. You do know that right? If not, I suggest you turn off the TV for the same reasons. When science say "Tobacco is not unhealthy", same with Sugar and fat.
Then you should get a hint.
Especially when the " sponsors" it the corporations that wants that science report.</p>
<p>Look, I couldn't care less about you or your health.
I'm not after likes on Facebook or doing your virtue signalling.
I couldn't care less if you get sad or upset even. I don't know you.
I care about my circle of friends and family.</p>
<p>How many times have you thought about the homeless? Given them food or shelter?
How often have you donated time, money, or effort to a third world country? Probably none. You don't get likes for that.
You don't get a "I have fed a homeless some soup today" sticker on Facebook, to show off next to "I took the vaccine" sticker.</p>
<p>Open your eyes. Go outside and smell the flowers.</p>

        <p>The irony here is so thick you could spread it with a butter knife.</p>
<p>Anecdotes work against viruses.
You’re safe from the virus because you don’t watch tv.
The people that know what propaganda is are the ones you need to worry about.
Exposed to people all day but I haven’t gotten sick <em>yet</em>, so the virus isn’t real (makes me wonder how many of those people were wearing masks for <em>your</em> protection?).
Cites the media’s position on tobacco from over 50 years ago as proof that science is “bought”.
Assumes I have Facebook (probably projection).
Assumes I’ve never helped the homeless (I used to literally work in a care house, homie).
Tells me to “open my eyes” and provides ZERO evidence to support any claims.</p>
<p>Those are all things you just said. And they are all incredibly stupid and ironic.</p>

        <p>So you’ve never gotten sick before? I find that really hard to believe.</p>
<p>How would your immune system know to combat a novel coronavirus that it has never encountered before? Answer: you get sick, develop antibodies, combat the sickness, and develop a higher resistance to the virus. You might be asymptomatic in that process, which would be lucky, or you might end up on a ventilator.</p>
<p>Just “having an immune system” doesn’t mean anything.</p>

        <p>Of course I have been sick. I have had a cold about twice a year. I'm not sure if I've ever had a flu. But I think so.
I have had fevers. I had the normal expected child sicknesses in the 60-70s.</p>
<p>I have never been very sick though.
And I'm no "anti vaxxer". I had 3-4 or 5 while growing up. My mom isn't 100% sure.</p>
<p>I may have had " novella Corina virus". I may not have had it. And I will never know. </p>
<p>I have never been dumb enough to test for it.</p>
<p>Because I read early on, that PRC tests will find something when the cycle more than 40 times.
That set off my alarm bells. When they can chose any cycles for search for anything.
I'm no scientist. But I have a Masters degree. With 30+ years work experience in IT security.
If I can chose parameters like that, something isn't right!</p>
<p>You sounds like a smart guy, actually. I don't believe you're a shill. But I do believe you have fallen for Fauci &amp; CO's plans for earning money on vaccines.

That and, Big pharma have been busted many times at least since 1975. Why shouldn't they today?</p>
<p>And PS! There's plenty of Gov websites, that still have PDFs, showing they have planned this Plandemic since 2012!
Myself, I have since Dec 2019 downloaded 19GB of Gov PDFs and other data that was/is in the open/about this Plandemic.
I'm happy. I have my sources. If you don't. That's okay.</p>

        <p>And where did you read the PCR tests aren’t valid? That was put to rest a while ago. The WHO put out an “information notice” that was quickly misunderstood and spun into a false narrative:</p>
<p>&rt;”[…] The Notice discusses weak positive results (late or high CTs) – not all positives. It goes on to say that if the test doesn’t fit with the patient’s health (I’d add contact and epidemiological history) status, a new sample should be collected and the test repeated. A lab may use the initial test or a different test (good labs are armed with tests that target more than one genetic region of SARS-CoV-2 or come from more than one commercial supplier).”</p>
<p>&rt; The COVID-19 PCR test detects the presence of the virus that causes the disease by amplifying a small part of the virus’ genetic material. The number of amplification cycles needed to arrive at a threshold considered to be “positive” is also called the cycle threshold (Ct) value. The Ct value is dependent on the amount of virus in a sample. The more virus present, the fewer amplification cycles are needed to reach the positive threshold, while a low viral load requires more amplification cycles to reach that threshold.</p>
<p><a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/most-positive-pcr-test-results-are-true-positives-who-information-notice-didnt-change-threshold-or-criteria-for-a-positive-test/">Here is a fact-check on why that is a misconception.</a></p>
<p>There are a LOT of links to sources in that fact check, and it helps you understand what a PCR test is and why there is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>As for Fauci, I disagree. He has not been “dirty” for 40 years, and he’s not “dirty” now. There hasn’t been anything substantial that shows he is corrupt. His annual pay is public knowledge, his emails can be accessed via FOIA, if he has been dirty for nearly half a century, as a public servant, well… that’s very hard to do. Senators get away with it, but someone in Fauci’s position is under a lot of scrutiny and answers to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Sure, we can smack-talk Big Pharma all day, some of those people are downright evil. But there is entirely too much visibility on this Covid vaccine for this to be some sinister plan.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what sort of PDFs you have saved that are evidence of this Covid pandemic being planned since 2012. But, perhaps, are you mistaking pandemic preparedness and procedures with a purposeful and designed false-flag? </p>
<p>Maybe you can share some of those documents so I can see what so thoroughly convinced you? Just saying that you have documents proves nothing. Kinda like “My dad works for Nintendo.”</p>

        <p>I have no reason to even try satisfy you with any proof.
Even IF I sent you a memory stick, instead of "enjoy" and discover, you would use every second trying to debunk everything. I rather share with people that want to know. You're not one of them.</p>

        <p>Lol ok yea you’re full of shit. For someone working cyber security with an alleged masters degree, you think you have to “send me a memory stick”? You said these links are still active, right? how about you point me in the right direction? Or how about you upload a couple to Google drive and set me up with a link? Too much work for you?</p>
<p>And you expect me to just… not critically think? Why would I just look at these documents without trying to debunk them? Isn’t that the exact behavior you’re against? Aren’t you telling people to “open their eyes and smell the flowers”? You just want something that confirms your narrative so you can keep shooting that fear straight into your veins like a goddamn junkie.</p>
<p>You’ve got nothing. You don’t know how vaccines work, and even admitted so on another subreddit. You have zero proof, you’re a liar, and you’re purposefully spreading misinformation because you’re too proud to admit you’re wrong and too stubborn to try to learn something new.</p>
<p>And when challenged, you resort to insulting my mother. We’ve been going back and forth for three days and you’re either just too lazy to put in the work, or spreading the same information that far-right websites are spreading for a far more nefarious reason. Or, more likely, both.</p>
<p>Pathetic. Keep living in fear, boomer.</p>

        <p>“Feel” smart. As opposed to the usual? That’s not quite the insult you think it is.</p>
<p>It’s no badge of honor, it’s the regalia of ignorance. You’re led by feelings, and too proud to look them in the face.</p>
<p>When I saw you admit on r/conspiracy that you didn’t know anything about vaccines, I thought this might be a chance to help someone understand. But I was wrong. You are obviously entirely unwilling to dislodge yourself.</p>
<p>You project your insecurities. I tried asking you questions. I tried giving you sources. You insulted me, lied to me, and hid behind phantom evidence. You argue in bad faith. You’re a stereotype at this point.</p>
<p>Wear that little boomer badge proudly while the rest of us clean up after you. Go on, now.</p>
