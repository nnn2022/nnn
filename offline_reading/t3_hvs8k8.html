    <strong>A statistic no one talks about.</strong>
    <p><p>I came across a statistic that I realized was currently unused in all covid arguments from both sides. We say "over 100,000 people have died from covid in the US this year". Well I realized that there is a critical statistic that is ignoring: has the overall rate of people dying increased. In other words, we all know that covid primarily kills people on their way out. It attacks people who are weakened and old. So if we look at all the people who die in a typical year, do we see an increase of 100,000?? Are these 100,000 NEW deaths that wouldn't otherwise occur? Or are just counting these ones and the others we ignore?</p>
<p>Well it turns out that almost over 2 million people die in the US each year. Almost 3 million in fact. And according to the CDC, over 2 million of those almost 3 million deaths are of people 65 and older. And that number is from 2017. People really do forget that we have a big country. </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/older-american-health.htm</p>
<p>We obviously don't have all the death data for 2020 yet, but even not taking into account that we know the numbers are inflated, (and that actually what the cdc tracks now, according to their website is deaths "involving " covid-19 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm not deaths "from* covid-19), it helps to put the number 100,000 in perspective and it really makes me wonder what percentage of that is NEW deaths. Deaths that wouldn't happen anyways. </p>
<p>I found a wonderful site that puts it in perspective as well. People have started trying to say that "it's not just old people and sick people, kids die too sometimes". And yes that's true. There have been 13 deaths of school aged children between the ages of 5-14 from covid. But there have been over 1700 total deaths in that age group this year. </p>
<p>https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/06/23/coronavirus-covid-deaths-us-age-race-14863</p>
<p>The point is, if we track any other disease, especially one that attacks old sick dying people and report every death like it wouldn't have happened anyways, of course it would be  terrifying. I REALLY want to know what is the percentage of cases that result in someone dying who would not otherwise die.</p></p>

<p>But at the same time things are terrible in this country (US) because everyone is so selfish!</p>
<p>If only everyone would comply!!!!</p>
<p>I can't figure out if Americans are doing a good job of stopping the virus or a terrible job, the narrative changes so fast.</p>

        <p>Thank you! From the charts I found it actually looked like we were about 30% over actually.. Which was surprising. I do anticipate a large drop in the current months and next year to accommodate all those who died earlier than they otherwise would have because of covid. Do you have a link to the data you were reading? Mine was just the graph on the bottom of the page of the cdc excess death rates from covid-19 page.</p>

        <p>I was just going by the graph myself.  Yes, we hit the peak mid April and it is up to 35% excess.  The last three weeks of data are zero to negative.  note the % excess doesn't show negative numbers but it would be about -15% for the most recent week.</p>

        <p>It's what I've been trying to tell people from the start. I saw a doctor's blog where he was saying that paying attention only to death counts from a single cause aren't useful, we have to look at "excess deaths".  Yes, there was a good-sized bump of excess deaths at the peak of the 'rona, but if you look at a chart going back years, there is a bump every winter. Some winters are worse than others. The excess deaths from influenza in the winter of 1957-58 were <strong>far</strong> greater (per-capita) than for 'rona.</p>
<p>The thing with excess deaths is, after there is a larger bump, quite often it's smaller by an almost equivalent amount the next year.  One can imagine that there is a steady supply of humans nearing death, who are carried off by one disease or another. Virulent diseases kill them sooner, but it's likely something would have killed them in a year or two anyway.</p>

        <p>Worldwide, there's been about a 15% increase in excess mortality (via the former health minister of Israel). Which is of course quite small and does not justify destroying people's lives and the future of an entire generation.</p>

        <p>Yes, I was wondering if there were any wars going on in other countries or other events that may have caused an increase in deaths, but like you said, the lockdown are to blame for a lot of them. Starvation, suicides, delayed medical care, ect.</p>

        <p>Indeed - excess deaths in the UK are up for the period, and greater than in last 5 years (but apparently lower than a number of years before that).</p>
<p>I'd expect over the coming months or year they will go down.</p>
<p>It's strange how in 2013 excess deaths in the UK winter went up by a huge amount:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/news/older-people/excess-deaths-rose-by-a-third-last-winter/">https://www.nhs.uk/news/older-people/excess-deaths-rose-by-a-third-last-winter/</a></p>
<p>But as far as I know they weren't given billions to keep them alive, in fact the government has blood on its hands from all the austerity cuts.</p>
<p>Now it's all about saving old and sick people at ALL costs. Or at least that's the message being pumped out.</p>
<p>Strange.</p>

        <p>As others have mentioned, the term you are looking for is "excess deaths."   <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-53073046">Here's a quick discussion world wide</a>.</p>
<p>So in short,  the official US COVID death toll right now is about 240,000.   The number of excess deaths in the US (all causes) is 97,300.   The number of excess deaths officially attributed to COVID is 70,300. </p>
<p>&rt;  I REALLY want to know what is the percentage of cases that result in someone dying who would not otherwise die.</p>
<p>So the simple answer to that question is about 40% are strictly attributed to  COVID, the other 60% would have died in any case.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I used a simplifying assumption, that ALL excess were COVID in one way or another.  According to the actual stats, the numbers are actually 30% COVID,  70% would have died in any case. </p>
<p>It's way oversimplified, but that's the numbers.  </p>
<p>BTW if you look at the linked web site you will see one of the huge problems with numbers like this.   The reporting is all over the road.  From 1% to 204% excess deaths.  Some of this real difference some is difference in recording and reporting.</p>

        <p>They scare people by saying big numbers like 140K deaths. But that is still very small compared to total normal deaths. If that were 100K+ deaths under 65 years old, that would be a serious statistical anomaly, but this is not the case currently.</p>
<p>Until we have the total death statistics of 2020, we won't know how many deaths were "displacement deaths".</p>
<p>Similar to the US, from where I am, according to official statistics, 33% of deaths are at least 10 years above the life expectancy, 73% or deaths  are from people at or over the life expectancy and 91% of deaths are above the age of 70.</p>
<p>Even if there is zero death displacement, which I highly doubt considering the average age of death, that would mean an increase of about 8% over last year, which is within the margin of error.</p>
<p>People seem to have forgotten that over 60 million people die each year worldwide.</p>
