    <strong>We can all make a difference.</strong>
    <p><p>The mask is a symbol of submission but many people wear one just to be polite or to not have an argument over it or to comply with state laws. A lot of people disagree or are against wearing a mask but do so anyway for the reasons listed above. When you don’t wear a mask people do realize and it does make a difference even if you don’t see it. </p>
<p>Recently I took a two day hunter education class so I can hunt in my state. It was held at a sportsman club and was free to take. First day was wednesday and considering the demographic of such a class I didn’t wear a mask at all. Nobody said anything to me but 90% of people including instructors had a mask on the first day. A few people took it off and it wasn’t enforced or even spoken about. Well today was the second day and 90% of the people were NOT wearing masks and none of the instructors had a mask on today. I’m not saying I was the reason for this as I wasn’t the only one the first day but believe me it felt  like such a relief to walk in today and see almost no one was wearing a mask. It seems once people realize nobody cares no one wears the stupid mask. Be brave be that person who inspires others to take the mask off. God bless all you wonderful people.</p></p>

        <p>I don't go anywhere where they are required if possible. We have established a network of shops which don't require a mask and the owners are not wearing them but we are lucky to not live in the city.</p>

        <p>I replaced the mask with a piece of black lace that I pin to my hair (it's the same kind of lace that was used to cover your hair if you went into a church pre-Vatican II).  Kind of makes me look like a Victorian widow or an extra in the opera "Carmen" depending on whether it's over my face or thrown back.  Today I got in an elevator with a bunch of strangers and used the veil to play peek-a-boo with a baby.  Not only did no one get mad, but they loved it!  Especially the baby :D</p>

        <p>I've been wearing a plastic, transparent mask in stores since late last year and no one has called me out on it yet. I'm sure most people look at me and think I'm an uneducated idiot and that's fine, but I hope that I can set an example and inspire at least a small minority to question the science and show their faces again</p>
