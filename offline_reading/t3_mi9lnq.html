    <strong>I‚Äôm a children‚Äôs face painter. Last weekend I finally had my first gig in over a year, not a mask in sight. But I‚Äôm already seeing the side effects in kids from all this.</strong>
    <p><p>Like the title says, I‚Äôm a face painter on the side, have been for about 8 years. Used to make quite a bit of money from it, so it was definitely a financial blow with the lockdowns. I‚Äôve been advertising for months, and last Saturday I FINALLY booked someone. 
I‚Äôm in a small Southern California town where, luckily, most people are pretty normal, and I haven‚Äôt worn a mask in 6+ months. It was a WONDERFUL little party, about 15 kids all running around and having a good time, the parents sitting around tables chatting. One or two adults had masks on for whatever reason, but mostly normal.</p>
<p>Then the mom that hired me brought out her young toddler (I think she said she was gonna be turning 2 in a few months), and one of the other parents asked if she had just woken up, because she was so quiet and sullen.
The mom replied ‚Äúno, that‚Äôs just how she is. She was raised during the lockdowns, she‚Äôs not really used to being around people‚Äù, and oh my gosh, my heart just sank. I‚Äôve said from the get-go that the young kids would be SO screwed over by these lockdowns. </p>
<p>Last year I was working in a preschool/daycare during the beginning of the lockdowns, and watched toddlers stay there for 8+ hours a day around exclusively masked adults. They only saw eyes for the majority of their day. At a crucial developmental stage where they are learning to recognize facial expressions.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not looking forward to seeing what sort of impact this has had on our kids in the coming years.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;Yep, beyond just having to wear a mask and not being able to see faces and facial expressions, some of the parents are actively modeling phobia of other humans, that's not good for social development in so many ways.</p>
<p>Yes, but they tend to live much shorter and more miserable lives.</p>

        <p>Tbh I think most of us come on here to let off steam. I'm angry a lot of the time due to the situation and it's nice to rant, not really interested in having discussions with donuts who think the government is here to help. I think most are too dense anyway, using logic with the illogical who don't want to learn anyway never works. If this sub changed your opinion you're a minority within a minority.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think you are right and it's largely driven by emotion. It's unfortunate because I do feel like there are so many solid points to make and change people's minds on. If someone can present themselves in a less challenging/aggressive way, I think there is opportunity for discourse here, but the people here also have the opportunity to react more politely and empathetically, which is how you change people's minds in my opinion. At the same time, it isn't hard for me to understand the anger and frustration that people have here, and I've got some myself.</p>

        <p>Baffled is a word used when someone is perplexed. Perplexed means puzzled and puzzled is a synonym for confused, just so you've got it all straight. </p>
<p>I'm not surprised you aren't worried about our bafflement because you've already shown you aren't worried about the 549,000 Americans(2.83 million worldwide) that have died while you continue to refuse to follow scientific evidence. </p>
<p>Ironically the same people refusing to follow scientific advise to control the outbreak as almost always the most "patriotic" and "freedom loving" people. If you truly loved freedom of this country or were patriotic and simply selfish (meaning you only care about <em>your</em> freedom) you'd be more mindful of the fact that you're part of the reason that 549,000 people lost their freedom when they died of a disease that could've been stopped.</p>

        <p>Respiratory viruses cannot be stopped. That has never happened in history, and it is illogical to try. They become endemic and recur every year. If you want to point to New Zealand, they are an island nation, and have locked down relatedly over 1 case and no community transmission. Since covid is endemic in the rest of the world, they will need to continue to do that.</p>
<p>The people affected by covid are old, in some cases older than the average life expectancy. The lost Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY, a measurement of disease morbidity burden) is small. The lockdowns affect everyone, with disproportionate effects on the young. The response to covid has destroyed a generation a children. We will be seeing the repercussions for the next 60 years. The QALY lost from lockdowns is <em>enormous</em>.</p>

        <p>I follow this page already so it's not the reddit timer, but ok</p>
<p>I didn't miss your point. Your point was "its OK that they died because they were old and their quality of life was bad" and also "we shouldn't shut down to save lives because it will has ripple effects for generations." </p>
<p>So for starters, no it's not just the old dying. Young and middle aged deaths are plenty and anyone who survives has permanent damage. </p>
<p>I cany even comment on the second point because it's a moral issue that won't change. Do you value the lives of 3 million people globally or your own families comfort more. Yes the lock downs will have effects, but so did the response to 9/11 (the biggest change to happen to the USA living) and nobody went around angry about how badly it will change our daily lives.</p>

        <p>&rt;Young and middle aged deaths are plenty </p>
<p>According to the CDC's own numbers covid is less deadly than the seasonal flu to these groups.</p>
<p>&rt;anyone who survives has permanent damage. </p>
<p>Blatantly false. Rates of lingering post-infection morbidity is low, and it is being ignored that other vial infections can also cause lingering effects. Besides which it is being reported prominently in order to scare young people who are at no risk. Just like the lie that the variants are more harmful to young people [[study]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(21)00030-4/fulltext) </p>
<p>&rt; No significant differences were found in age, proportion of patients with comorbidities, proportion of patients from Black, Asian, and minority ethnicity background, or deprivation score between groups</p>
<p>That is a direct quote from a study on the B.1.1.7 UK variant.</p>
<p>&rt;Yes the lock downs will have effects, but so did the response to 9/11 (the biggest change to happen to the USA living) and nobody went around angry about how badly it will change our daily lives. </p>
<p>Also blatantly false, many people including myself are very angry about the changes to an overt police state after 9/11, including myself. There is substantial overlap between people posting here and people who are against fascism posing as security.</p>
<p>There were many protests against the Patriot Act and other things, which the media predictably did not report on, just like they don't report on the tens of thousands of doctors saying lockdowns are a terrible idea.</p>

        <p>It does sound like a lot of deaths and I understand how you feel. You have to consider A LOT more than the death count though. For example, the average age of death from covid, vs the regular average age of death, why were our research-driven pandemic response plans not followed, what are the interests at the top for this response, could the deaths be overcounted, why are flu cases down by such an enourmous amount, why are dissenting voices being censored (e.g. look up no new normal on Google vs several other search engines, but there are more examples like a group of scientists being banned on Facebook), etc.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend Lord Sumption's interview UnHerd. He was a supreme justice in the UK and he says a lot about some of these things in a very articulate way to argue against the current measures in the UK. He is also (at least he calls himself) liberal. I was a little iffy about a couple of his points on vaccine passports and liberty, but it was a great interview in my opinion and I respect his beliefs. He's obviously a very smart guy.</p>

        <p>With 2 minutes of actual research, you'd realize that those death numbers are extraordinarly inflated. Every death WITH covid counts as a covid death so you have hundreds of thousands dying from heart attacks, old ages, suicide, etc. and being added to the death count because they were an "asymptomatic" carrier and happened to die. Hospitals make bank off this and the media and government play along so they can continue to spread fear and keep people in line. So no, I dont care or "do anything to keep others safe". This is a complete joke and the actual death count is 10% of the number theyre giving us. Meaning this is no more deadly than the flu.</p>

        <p>And yet, the death rate in the U.S. in 2020 as currently counted was 19% higher than in 2019.  517,000 more deaths.  The death rate in December was 39% higher than recent Decembers.  The evidence strongly suggests that experts were right when they said that the Covid death totals have been undercounted, especially back in April.</p>

        <p>The outcome of inflating the death count is that there were 19% more death certificates in 2020?  </p>
<p>Let me make it very clear.  The CDC reports many things, including the total number of deaths from all causes.  These numbers come from death certificates.  They represent actual people who died.  For this count, it does not matter what caused their death. It's not a total of the different types of deaths.  It is literally a count of death certificates.  It takes months to count all of these from states and counties all over the country.  There won't be an official total until late 2021 at least.  But, the CDC keeps a running total, which can be found online by searching for provisional death counts and looking at the yearly total for all causes.  The current total for 2020 is 3,371,020.   The official complete total for 2019 was about 2.854 million.  That means that at least 19% more people died in 2020 than in 2019.</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre not wrong. The issue is that the death rate goes up every year due to population increase. Go ahead and try and find pre-2019 (2018, 2017, etc) overall death count data on CDC webpage. I‚Äôll wait. It‚Äôs been scrubbed from the internet. </p>
<p>You also have to consider the fact that covid lockdowns have caused death rates of other causes to skyrocket. Look at overdoses. Homicides. Suicides. Deaths from putting off elective or other surgeries. Do these things and population increase account for ALL of the excess deaths in 2020 compared to 2019? Probably not. But it accounts for a lot of it. And the death rates vary every year. Some years have particularly high flu death rates without corona. All things to take into consideration.</p>

        <p>With 2 minutes of actual research (and Google articles and News channels aren't actual research. Go find published scientific studies) you'd realize how Cause of Death works. </p>
<p>Take for example someone has heart disease, but its manageable and they have a prognosis of 10 years.</p>
<p>Now they get COVID and because their immune system is already very weak (heart failure) its severe.</p>
<p>COVID now damages their heart significantly and they die within a few weeks from heart failure.</p>
<p>Yes, they died from heart failure, but if not for COVID they wouldn't have died for another 10 years and therefore COVID is part of the cause of death.</p>

        <p>Ideally, babies and younger toddlers should spend most of their time with primary caregivers who don't need to wear masks around them.   I know that isn't always possible.  When they are home, they should have as much  interaction with their maskless family members as possible.  They also sell clear masks for daycare workers and those who want to communicate with people who read lips.  </p>
<p>Some kids are just uncomfortable around strangers and in groups, long before Covid.   One of my kids was that way.  Some parents are embarrassed and make excuses instead of just embracing kids have different personalities and comfort levels.  I wouldn't assume that child would have been different without the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Yes, it certainly is.  The refusal to acknowledge the reality of a global pandemic that increased the death rate in the U.S. by 19% in 2020, including a 40% increase in deaths in December as compared to past Decembers.   You all don't want to wear masks because it acknowledges the reality of the situation.  </p>
<p>We're all traumatized by the entire situation, and ignoring it and letting more people die, like what is happening right now in Brazil, will lead to trauma as well.  There are ways to help reduce the trauma for your kids, but refusing to wear masks in public is not one of them.</p>

        <p>Yes absolutely, its one thing that riles me up the most about this situation. Most of you need to learn how to mind your own fucking business. And if you think anger is an expression only children display, no wonder youre stunted in other ways too. Its a perfectly healthy emotion given what has been going on in the world. </p>
<p>That and these shameless displays of moral superiority and rampant fake virtue signaling. Its really just so predictable at this point. You dont give a fuck lady, you just want to circlejerk yourself into a rightous spiral or covid hysterics while the rest of the world wants to move on.

        <p>And there's all that mature emotion.  You know that most people actually care about other people.  They are selfish sometimes and don't always get it right when they're trying to do the right thing, but they actually care. It's not virtue signaling or displays of moral superiority.  </p>

        <p>Types like you argue from an angle of imposing moral blackmail on others. You bank on appealing to emotions, because you cant argue with facts. Facts are not on your side. You know it, you know I know it and everyone with a shred of brain tissue knows it. </p>
<p>This whole poo poo about wee wee most people are nice people who care about others. No dear. Most people are selfish. They want whats best for them and the people they love. They might not openly admit it or display it, but if you look deeper into their motives, it is the desire to do better for themselves. The only reason youre arguing here about this is because you too, are selfish. You want to convert others to your cause because you think it benefits you. And you have it wrong, humans are top of the food chain baby. We not only leave the weakest to die, we do much much worse to the weakest members of our species and other species too. Thats not to say we cant be kind, we certainly can, but you cant be this naive...</p>
<p>Why the fuck should i feel scared? For what? For THIS thing with 0, 000 something mortality rate for my age group? Why not feel scared of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, poverty, hunger, economic insecurity, increasing cuts to our civil liberties, our politicians being drunk on power handing out deals to their buddies, unknown effects of this fiasco on our children? And I should feel bad for what exactly? Take your guilt somewhere else, you will only convince me with appeal to FACTS, not attempts of blatant manipulation.</p>

        <p>I do agree that antibodies among people who recovered from Covid contribute to herd immunity, but vaccination allows for that to happen without letting the virus spread and letting people get sick.  Although herd immunity without vaccines has happened unintentionally throughout history, there is no logic to choosing that over vaccination.  If people make that choice because they have been misinformed about the risk of Covid versus the risks of the vaccines, that is frustrating to me.</p>

        <p>We would be dead if masks were as effective as you claim or at the very least infected people close to us to the point we wouldn't be able to deny what you THINK is reality. A lot of people on here don't even know anyone who's died of the virus. I don't. It's always a friends uncle or grandpa or a friend of a friend or a friend's fiance's mother's sister, lol. People call us lucky but you can only say that for so long before people just shrug and finally assess themselves that the risk of dying from this is extremely low.</p>
<p>In my area in Texas we had a 95% plus rate of compliance with all the measures and it did not stop cases from rising. You cannot stop people from dying of a disease. It's clear lockdowns and masks don't work otherwise we would be done with this. And before you blame people who didn't obey the orders understand that you will never get a 100% perfect compliance from any demographic. That's just the way humans are.</p>

        <p>I get so tired of seeing this on here. And predictably, it's the top comment.</p>
<p>"This is evil and it must stop!!!!" </p>
<p>Bruh, that ship has sailed. The ship has sailed so far, it's currently somewhere in Fiji. </p>
<p>The evil is on-going, and the time to have stopped it was probably early on last year. Now there is irreparable damage to many, including the kids. The trauma can't be repaired because it's been an entire year of masks, security theater, paranoia, and so on. So the kids are now screwed. </p>
<p>As OP said, the damage is now done. I've seen many small children, including babies, behaving the way OP described. The only thing left is to see how extensive the damage is, and how it will affect this generation growing up. Spoiler alert: it's not going to be pretty.</p>
<p>Oh, and for the people who are about to comment, "SHUT UP, THERE'S HOPE! THE KIDS WILL BE HAPPY AND PERFECT ONCE WE ARE BACK TO NORMAL!" Hilarious. No, saying that is optimistic drivel. These kids are screwed in more ways than I can describe in this comment. If the psychological trauma doesn't get them, then the financial repercussions will. </p>
<p>Have a nice day. :)</p>

        <p>Children 5 and under are going to be the most severely fucked up by this. </p>
<p>Years 0-5 are when your brain builds a foundation for the rest of your life. Even though most people don‚Äôt remember much from those years, they are developmentally the most important years and what happens during them - specifically, how your brain develops in response to what you experience - will have massive significance for the rest of your life, in countless ways. </p>
<ul>
<li>seeing others‚Äô facial expressions and using them to communicate </li>
<li>hugging/being held by different people </li>
<li>seeing new people and new places </li>
<li>interacting with new people, from the guy who plays peekaboo with you while you‚Äôre in line at the cashier to playing with a new person at the park </li>
<li>witnessing interactions between other people (including strangers) and observing their expressions/tones </li>
<li>seeing smiling faces </li>
</ul>
<p>These are absolutely essential things that ideally occur almost every day, but that must occur regularly. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs unethical to experiment on children, but from past research we know that relatively minor deprivations of these activities (even simply not seeing faces for short periods) can cause significant problems. It is terrifying to think what the impact of lockdowns will be on these kids. </p>
<p>Even worse: we didn‚Äôt just deprive these children of necessary experiences. We actively <strong>taught</strong> them to fear other people. We actively <strong>taught</strong> them to avoid other people - and that their mere existence can kill Grandma. </p>
<p>It is fucking criminal, and my anger at the parents who allowed this to happen - who often enthusiastically embraced these abusive practices - is endless. These children are victims, and many are going to become miserable, antisocial, angry people. Great job, humanity.</p>

        <p>Amazing post and exactly how I feel. We homeschooled our kids before all this bullshit began and for my kids, life hasn't changed much through all of this. I'm in one of the most locked down states (NM) and even though I put one on because I could lose my career, my wife and I NEVER make our kids wear them. At least 90% of their day-to-day interactions are with other maskless people too. Fuck the evil people who enabled all this.</p>

        <p>Aw, no that sucks! We're in ABQ, so no meetups unfortunately. So if you have kids, I'd look into homeschool co-ops. That's where we met most of our normal friends. There are even some sane lefties in there. Otherwise, I think you're on the right path trying to find a church that gives the middle finger to the governor.</p>

        <p>That was always our plan (to have lots of kids, homeschooled only) but apparently the people in charge of the universe had other plans for us. I did teach beginning piano lessons to children two decades ago though, so you've just given me an idea on where I should try to advertise (after brushing up my old skills of course) Thanks!</p>

        <p>Also the direct abuse of masking and Covid testing young children. My brothers and their wives all mask their young kids (the youngest is TWO. YEARS. OLD.), and seeing those photos posted in Facebook make me absolutely sick to my stomach.
One of them also forced their two year old to be Covid tested because she had typical mild to moderate flu/cold symptoms. They even had the option for a cheek swab, and instead chose the nasal swab because, according to them, it‚Äôs ‚Äúmore accurate‚Äù. That poor child had a swab rammed up her nose because she had a low grade fever and was tired.</p>

        <p>Wow. Aside from all the other stuff, that kid is going to have a phobia of <em>at least</em> corona- &amp; rhino- viruses- which since they're pretty common events, is definitely going to hurt them. I had a lot of fevers and cases of flu when I was young, but because my parents reacted well I quickly learned how to manage them, figure out what's a big deal and what's not, etc.  </p>

        <p>Yup. That‚Äôs the super fun thing about brain development during those years: you literally CANNOT just make it up later on. </p>

<p>I see many, many posts that blame introverts, obese, liberals, lgbt, minorities, and others. Look at the way people are attacking /u/breakyoudown4. I don't even see how their original comment was "a doomer comment". The only thing I got from it was that, well, they are anxious and introverted.</p>
<p>Again, people here hate introverts, blame them, then ostracize those who admit to being it. Really, this sub wants to pretend it's better than everyone else, but act the exact same way as the rest of humanity right now, just with a different set of criteria for their tribalism.</p>

        <p>All of us have flaws, my friend. Clearly, I have a temper, and I am pretty vindictive if my comments to this sub aren't a clue. There's a difference between having flaws, and actively trying to hurt others for self gratification. Based on your post history alone, I would not label you as a "horrible person". No human being is perfect, and all humans are flawed, it's just many are different degrees of flawed, and again, it all boils down to intent and whether one is doing evil things in order to gratify themselves.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't consider myself a good person. I've hurt others in the past, as we all have. I guess I just feel more remorse than some do. I don't know. As I said, there's many different degrees of flawed out there, some people are better at being good than others. </p>
<p>Also, freedom of speech is very important to me. I think people should have the right to speak their minds, and others have the right to disagree <strong>however</strong> without resorting to violence or censorship. One of the reasons I oppose the new normal is because a big part of this is an attack on personal freedom and liberty, and the current censorship going on, both online and offline, is unacceptable.</p>

        <p>&rt;Again, people here hate introverts, blame them, then ostracize those who admit to being it.</p>
<p>While I am sure you could find a few posts like that because every single large sub has some scummy posts on it, I have often and many times said I was an introvert by nature here and not a single time did anyone say anything judgmental about it here whatsoever and I've seen others do the same also with no issues.  What people hate here is introverts that want to force everyone else to be locked up too because they are too insecure to be introverts by themselves and they want everyone to be 'in it together'.  If you want to be an introvert, have fun, just don't try to force it on others.  Also not appreciated that you tried to strawman this argument and pull a martyr complex.</p>

However, I find that many of our so-called allies are just horrendous people, not much better than the people we are fighting against. It's not surprising to me, this is just the way people are.

        <p>I hate that my young kids are surrounded by people in masks at school/extracurricular activities and out in public. It‚Äôs messed up. I hate that my kindergartener can‚Äôt see her teachers mouth when she‚Äôs talking. :( when will this end? It‚Äôs super depressing. I just try to keep things as normal as possible for them. We visit with family, hang out with friends. I hope it helps.</p>

        <p>You'll find soon or in a couple years, that these children will be the perfect target for the new government. Obedient, isolated, lonely.</p>
<p>We again are putting in the hands of future generations, issues and problems for them to solve. This time, there's plenty information out there. People learned in school, know the facts from the past, yet we are allowing this to happen.</p>
<p>People are lazy, can't be bothered to look up what these corps are really up to. Oh aye, seems like a conspiracy theory now, but if you didn't pay attention to what Edward Snowden once said, to the scientists that are being silenced and banned from every social media, the censorship going on in news and media platforms, then you're a fucking lazy bastard who can't dare to think for themselves and need the homework done for them!</p>
<p>We're living in a time, where we hold more power, but for years people were fed technology and habits to make them dormant, that now they can't even use their critical minds.</p>
<p>It's sad, it's scary, it's disappointing. I'm so glad I have 0 children at the moment. And now, I am very sure I won't have one. Not to live in a world where people don't care about each other and obey everything without questioning.</p>

She has only been around very small groups of people and all mostly adults.

        <p>Psy major here, I've been telling people constantly about this how insanely crucial it is for children under the age of 10 to see and experience facial expressions. We have to reverse it as soon as possible. It's sickening to see some of my own family with children try and argue with me about it</p>

        <p>Gen Alpha is going to be the worst generation yet, and I say that as a fucking Zoomer lol. They've been raised with screens in their hands because their shit Millenial parents are too busy to talk to them or play with them, they just park them in the corner with an IPhone. Plus due to the pandemic regulations, they have spent a huge chunk of their most crucial developmental stages isolated, never going anywhere, and never seeing anyone. The people they do see have half their faces covered. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we have an entire generation of young children being raised with little personal contact/learning experiences at home, and no personal contact/learning experiences in public. Surely this will not mentally damage them in who knows how many ways. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>World War II and its consequences were a disaster for the human race. The Greatest Generation spawned what will now be 3 generations of entitled, anxious, awful human beings. We are fucked.</p>

        <p>I thank God that my wife was on mat leave when this started. I say that because it made the decision for her to stay home from here on out much easier. We will be homeschooling our kids at least until there are no masks in school. I thank God that we have friends with children around the same ages who don‚Äôt do masks and I thank God that there are enough sane people in our neighbourhood that the parks aren‚Äôt filled with masks. </p>
<p>I really couldn‚Äôt imagine sending my kids to daycare or school during this. Total insanity. At least we can process what‚Äôs happening instead of just internalizing it in a way we don‚Äôt understand.</p>
<p>Edit: I want to mention I live in the second most expensive city in Canada and make an average income. We are making sacrifices so our kids don‚Äôt have to.</p>

        <p>I was at the park with my oldest. We didn't wear a mask outside even though other kids weren't. I overheard another parent ask her son where his mask was. He said he lost it. The sister then told the parent "I wouldn't lose mine because I don't want to get sick." She then proceeded to say that she had to lower her mask for a few seconds and was nervous that it was wrong. </p>
<p>This girl was maybe 7-9 years old. I'm sure she is being set up for anxiety related to illness and socialization later in life. It's really sad what is happening. But if someone mentions any of this we are immediately labeled as a "grandma killer" and every other label under the sun.</p>

You still act like you have a choice... don't you know we must mask and inject every human being world wide, at least twice a year, no matter how small they are, even if they are not affected by the virus. Science shows the vaccine is super safe and effective! Don't you believe in science? Are you insane? Don't make us take your kids from you! They have a right to be raised healthy and subservient!</p>

        <p>This shit is really sad. I luckily don't have kids and have been a bit of a doomer lately considering all of the tyranny going on. Also the media trying to divide the country like a 10000 slice pizza doesn't help. Also an experimental jab for the masses. It's hard to stay optimistic when I am also a realist. Love all you guys who are awake!!</p>
