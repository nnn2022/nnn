    <strong>Reasons Why I do not want to vaccine (while living in New York)</strong>
    <p><p>So living in New York (been looking to escape well before Covid), it seems that practically speaking I will be coerced to get the vaccine. THe reason is because after falling out of a fitness regiment for 16 months, I NEED access to the gym. I believe this order does not require unvaccinated to wear a mask, but prohibits those not vaccinated from using the gym at all. This is most befuddling to me since poor fitness, obesity seems to be a huge predictor in who dies from this or suffers complications.</p>
<p>If you look at r/nyc, over and over again these lefties carrying on in support of this assert these is no rational basis on why anyone would not want to take this vaccine. I thought I would offer my reasons in way of bullet points.</p>
<p>- I already had the virus. So unless I have the misfortune as unlikely as winning a lottery, I am immune.</p>
<p>- Naturally flowing from this, I have no need to take the vaccine. Do people who already had the flu in a flu season (back when such a thing existed)  before getting a shot then go get a shot? No. So why should I....</p>
<p>- I am somewhat one (mid 40s), not as healthy as I was before the covid because the gyms were shut down, but am working on that now that I am back in the regimen. So for me covid is definirely a 99.8 plus survival risk for me.</p>
<p>- For me, getting the vaccine is not only superflous, but will pretty much guarantee being sick not once but twice. My lady was essentially forced to get the vaccine from her employer. It was not a straight up requirement, but was a so many pieces sort of flair headgame where they encoruaged it so strongly, even though insisting it is still voluntary, that it would be career suicide not to, not to mention require weekly testing, not being able to use the break room etc.</p>
<p>Because she already had it, her body's immune system reacted to in such a way that she was sick the day after both times.</p>
<p>When you compare cost versus probability, because I had a somewhat more mild fit of covid (was admittedly pretty sick first day, with fever, chills, shiver and shakes) for three days, I can only surmise that any reinfection, however unlikely, would be on par or less severe. I do not know exact odds, but I believe they are in the one to so many millions of getting it again.. whereas..</p>
<p>If I get the shot, I am pretty much one hundred percent guaranteed to be sick for a day, TWICE.</p>
<p>So in door number one I can expect to be sick for three days if I roll a one in so many million shot.. versus pretty much one hundred percent shot being sick one day, although somewhat more mild.</p>
<p>- This is to say nothing about mere emergency approval, various horror stories of severe side effects, deaths, etc (however rare or not so rare).</p></p>

        <p>I had COVID (severely) early 2020 --yet I couldn't get a straight answer whether I needed to get a vaccine or not = my hunch is that if you've had COVID, you're probably more immune than someone who gets the shot. But they refuse to give an answer.</p>

        <p>Had Covid in Jan of 2020- fast forward to Jan 2021 at a NYE party where 4 out of 6 ppl got Covid , we all shared drinks, pot and yet my fiancé and I who already had Covid in 2020 did not get sick. That’s an entire year of immunity. Just traveled to Florida last weekend- still immune apparently.</p>

        <p>I live in a one bedroom apartment with a woman and two cats. Weights would disturb the neighbors, not to mention the eldest of my two cats, a bruising part Maine Coon who would be a championship mouser if mice vee crossed his path (he does have one under his belt though)
Right now I am back on my old regimen, three days lifting for more or less one hr sessions, with two groups on first, third, and fifth days, second and fourth cardio (will work in lower back and other exercises before but still getting in better shape)
Aside from practical considerations, I need to rotate exercises every three to four weeks otherwise my body plateaus. So I really need access to a gym. I love the cable machine to do pec flies, bicep and tricep curls etc.
Whether one can or should workout at home not really the point. The point is whether there are valid reasons why someone legitimately should not have to take the vaccine. I do not think anyone could dispute anyone of my contentions, but rather just call me anti badder. I am not, I wouod get the vaccine if I were older, in a high risk group, etc.</p>

        <p>Buddy get the resistance bands I promise you. I paid £25 for a premium set and managed with ample space inside my bedroom. They come with a clip to go outside of a door for certain exercises and the rest you use your body’s weight and different bands for resistance. Cannot recommend them highly enough. Them plus an exercise bike you’re sorted with no need for a gym nor heavy equipment</p>

<p>That's an understatement. If you've already had Covid, you are MORE likely to win the lottery than to even be INFECTED with Covid again. Re-infections are very rare. And remember, you can't spread a virus you don't get infected with in the first place.</p>

        <p>Go on r/nyc or r/astoria. The conviction that there is no rational reason anyone would not want to get the vaccine seems as mo modification as those asserting that are ardent, militant,  and intolerant of anyone who disagrees.</p>
