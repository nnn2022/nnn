    <strong>From the perspective of someone who has never had a vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I am not vaccinated, and I have never had a vaccine. My friends and family members have never really cared about my vaccination status before Covid. Even as a child, I never had any issues not being vaccinated until I got into high school, but even then the issues weren't related to my health, they were related to my ability to be educated in the public system.</p>
<p>I eat plant-based. I am a certified yoga teacher. I am skilled in alternative medicines, including cannabis therapies. I believe in learning from nature, and many of the medicines and practices in the Healthcare industry are copied from plants/nature. </p>
<p>I will not put my body at risk with an experimental injection that was completely synthesized in a laboratory and physically altered on a genetic level using unnatural means, especially if my body has never been introduced to foreign substances in vaccines before the covid-19 p(l)andemic. </p>
<p>I've never had a "normal" vaccine (not even the childhood vaccines), so I have a hard time believing that exposing my body to a biological technology with no known long-term studies or known side-effects would be any safer for me at this point in time, especially since the clinical trials for the major brands won't finish until the end of 2022 (Pfizer), and the spring of 2023 (Moderna). I have never had synthetically crafted chemicals bypass my digestive system (which is designed to rid the body of pathogens) and enter my bloodstream, so I'm highly confident the "rare" cases of myocarditis, blood clots, strokes, and GBS would be less likely rare for myself, especially since I'm only 22. </p>
<p>https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/06/10/covid-vaccine-myocarditis-rates-061021</p>
<p>Not to mention, all of the placebo participants in both of the studies were unblinded, so there is no longer a control group in the study to compare data results with, and as someone who has never taken a vaccine, having access to that information would have been helpful to make an educated decision, but now that won't be possible. And this is not normal statistical practice for clinical trials for any vaccine in history, as far as I'm aware. </p>

<p>I look at health as a long-term investment, rather than something you can get a quick-fix for... I'm not a believer in the idea that you can take a pill or a shot and any chronic health condition you've had will magically disappear.</p>
<p>When I have the freedom to choose, I choose not to ingest genetically modified organisms in my food, which has a better chance of being cleansed out of my body by my digestive system than an injection to my bloodstream would... so how does this shot make sense for individuals like myself?
 https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/covid-19-vaccines-genetic-modification/112020/</p>
<p>I wasn't always like this. I actually used to really trust the Healthcare system, and I gave it a genuine chance. </p>
<p>I was 16 and diagnosed with Type 2 Bipolar disorder, and I was essentially coerced into taking multiple pharmaceutical drugs manufactured by some of the same companies that are manufacturing these covid "vaccines" because I was told by "experts" I would never function normally on an emotional or mental level without altering my brain's chemistry. </p>
<p>I trusted these experts, and from that trust I acquired "rare" side-effects to 4 out of 5 of the medications they tested on me, after assuring me the risk/chance was virtually zero. (This is what eventually lead me to a plant-based diet, yoga, and alternative/Cannabis therapies.)</p>
<p>Seroquel is made by AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>As a vegan, I don't know how it was possible, but I gained 20 pounds in one month from taking that drug, had severe withdrawal symptoms when taken off of it, to the point I threw up foam and started having convulsions. I was addicted to Xanax, and my doctors were aware of this, yet they still put me on Seroquel, a diben-zothiazepine, which is a derivative of benzodiazepenes, what Xanax is made out of. They cut me off of it cold-turkey when I started having side-effects, and I had worse withdrawal symptoms than when I detoxed off of Xanax. Why would they put me on something I was previously addicted to? Could it be the doctors had an incentive to issue out these prescriptions?</p>

<p>One of the drugs, called Latuda, was brand new and just finished clinical trials for individuals with the more depressive kind of bipolar disorder, which is what I had. I took it for 2 weeks and contracted facial spasms that are to this day, irreversible. I still have them, and cannabis is the only thing that helps. The condition it triggered is called Tardive dyskinesia, and I don't share this often with family or friends, but this is why I make weird "bunny nose twitches," have a delayed reaction in my speech where I have to blink/grimace really weird and my throat makes these weird closing up spasms, and other odd facial tics, usually when I have stress or anxiety (especially presenting publicly). The company who makes this drug, Lupin Pharmaceuticals, is currently trying to cash in on the incentives for producing covid-19 vaccines and seeking partnerships with either Moderna or Pfizer. https://www.verywellmind.com/latuda-drug-information-380262</p>

<p>I also had severe problems with Depakote, as my hair started to fall out in large clumps. I had major mood stabilization issues with this drug, and I believe it made my serotonin levels worse off. Depakote is owned by AbbVie, who has had close partnerships with Pfizer in the past. They also just lost their chief legal officer to Moderna.

<p>I do not trust these companies, especially since one of the companies (Pfizer) has been caught falsifying their research for various products and has been fined one of the largest settlement amounts in history for pharmaceutical fraud. https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history </p>
<p>Moderna was partially owned by Merck, who recently sold their ownership of the company (probably to keep the records as clean as possible), but has also been convicted of fraudulent activities and deceptive practices.

<p>I stopped going to drug dealers to heal my problems, whether they are licensed drug dealers or not. </p>
<p>I respect your choice to put whatever you want into your own body, but please exercise that same respect for those who choose differently than you.</p></p>

        <p>Just here to say I'm vegan too.
That's part of what gives me so much confidence in my immune-systems ability to thwart all kinds of infectious diseases.
When you don't count the broken wrist from my bicycle accident in 2015, I had 3 sick-days in total since I went vegan in 2014.
They were in November 2017.</p>
<p>Prior to being vegan I had respiratory issues quite regularly. Including a hospital-stay with antibiotic treatment after coughing not going away for months.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing brother. I feel like it could have been my own text. I'm vegan, bipolar and have also tried a variation of pharmaceuticals (including the Latuda-poison), but none has worked for me. Been smoking alot of weed and I really love it for so many reasons, but its illegal and socially frowned upon where I live which makes it difficult and turns me paranoid after a while. So I try to stay clean and have not smokes more than a few joints the last 1,5 years. Can you please elaborate on how you use cannabis as a medicinal plant?</p>

        <p>Have you tried edibles?  Or, have you tried strains which are high in CBD (but relatively low in THC)?</p>
<p>Strains high in CBD have really helped me, as have edibles.</p>

        <p>Hey! First of all, I'm more of a "sister" than a "brother" lol, but thank you for your support! :) Secondly, I smoke cannabis, but I also make handmade cannabis oils that I customize. If I'm making it for myself, it's a little easier because I know my ailments (the facial spasms, lumps in my breasts, anxiety, etc.) Then, I do some research on a variety of strains that have an optimal ratio of cannabinoids and terpenes that have been proven to work for those conditions. Sometimes, I'll combine strains to get a better ratio, but if I'm tight on money I just get one. I use organic coconut oil from Costco that costs me like 11$ for a whole gallon. I have a special ratio that I use for dividing the coconut oil to the cannabis to get the desired concentration. I use a mortar and pestle and I hand grind the weed in that and slowly add some coconut oil to the weed to make a paste. This breaks down the cell walls of the plant to get a greater extraction of the chemical compounds, and a pro-tip is that I don't decarboxylate the weed until it's in the oil and into a paste in the crockpot. This is so the pot can catch anything that's burning off as the weed is being active. I keep it at a temp below 275 to prevent the cannabinoids from burning off, and in case I add any essential oils to create ethyl esters, it won't burn those off either. </p>
<p>I use the oils in a therapeutic Ayurvedic application called Abhyanga Massage. Basically, you soak the body (or the affected areas) with a medicated oil and use a special pulling/rubbing massage technique to allow the oils to sink deeper into the skin and really give your lymphatic system a cleanse. </p>
<p>I have some pictures and testimonials, I'll see if I'm able to link them here. :) </p>
<p>I hope that helps a little bit! It's a lot different than smoking it. You still feel a little high, but it's more of a relaxed body-high sensation without feeling paranoid. And you definitely get a little bit hungry!</p>

        <p>hahaha. I feel like a jerk for saying this on a vegans post... I am so so sorry.  </p>
<p>Firstly, I respect your choice and autonomy. Great choice. Great points super duper respect. No question.  </p>
<p>I was just going to say that many in the keto/carnivore community share your distrust of the medical system and other forms of governmental health advice. They too experimented with diet, exercise and found great benefit from those kinds of avenues as opposed to standard treatment. This isn't to compare veganism to keto/carnivore, but rather to say that alternate therapies and treatments really do seem to have their place.  </p>
<p>Again, no disrespect haha</p>

        <p>I've never been vaccinated. Neither has my sister, my wife, her brother, or her two cousins. I also have a few cousins who are unvaccinated. And I have 3 friends who are unvaccinated. </p>
<p>We all went to public school, played sports, and have good jobs now.</p>
<p>My wife and I competed at the national level of powerlifting. Her cousin played semi professional soccer, and two of our three friends were college athletes. I never missed a day of school from k-12. Can't say the same for my vaccinated friends as kids. </p>
<p>We are all alive and well. I had the chicken pox (Christmas break) as a kid and whooping cough in college, which was annoying but not life threatening at all. We've all had the common cold and I'm sure someone got the flu at some point. But that's it. </p>
<p>If you believe the mainstream narrative, at least a few of us should be dead by now. But we aren't.  We all survived the Plandemic and needless to say, we won't be getting this "vaccine" either.</p>

        <p>The term "side effect" itself is purposefully misleading. There is no such thing as a drug side effect, these are all unwanted DIRECT effects from the drugs. </p>
<p>Direct as in a 100% link between these drugs and those new diseases/ailments ... Calling it a side effect makes it sound mild and secondary to other more beneficial effects, but it doesn't sound like OP benefited greatly from these drugs.</p>

        <p>I have a chronic condition that is completely ignored by the government.</p>
<p>It seems that the government is controlled  by big pharma and big chem in what health care they want to provide, especially in a socalized system like here in Ontario.</p>
<p>After three reports over 30 years, the 550,000 sufferers here in Ontario are still neglected, ignored, and left to fend for themselves. In many cases family members decide individuals (often mothers/sisters/aunts) must be crazy and abandon them, in part from the silence of the government, doctors, and medical schools.</p>
<p>After the 3rd (2017) report came out and was completely ignored, I realized just how little the government actually cares about health.</p>
<p>Like you, I eat very carefully (not vegan, but source my animal protein from small family farms) and avoid pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p>https://chemical-edge.com/es-mcs-in-ontario/</p>
<p>I don't believe the pharma companies know or care what this injection could do to people like me (and you) who experience "side effects". I don't want to find out. And I don't want to spend the rest of my life in bed, which is a very real possible progression of my condition.</p>

        <p>I'm assuming you may have looked into the connection between MCS and potential mold toxicity and/or lyme/co-infections, or other toxic overload from heavy metals, pollutants, etc? <br>
I started doing some reading on this stuff after my brother was likely living in a toxic mold apartment for many years. We had to look into a lot of alternative therapies. Dr. Neil Nathan has written some great books on these topics and I'm sure there are also a lot of other resources as well. Let me know if you want to discuss this further as its a huge topic that is not in mainstream medicine circles.</p>

        <p>Same as you, except for the horrible medical history you have had.</p>
<p>The last time I had a vaccination, according to my mother, I was about 8 years old. Haven't had another one in the last 35 years and don't plan on ever having one.</p>
<p>Weird thing too is I never get sick. So, while half of those around me are getting a flu vaccine and still getting the flu, I think it was about 20 years ago since I caught the flu and, with the huge amounts of Vitamin C I take, it was gone in 36 hours.</p>

        <p>For a second I almost thought you were one of my real life anti-lockdown friends (their a yoga teacher, alternative medicine promoter, and vegan...but hey there's a large group of us that see the evidence there haha).I like your commitment to research and willingness to distrust being sold some magic pill for your symptoms! Its depressing to hear about your bad reactions but I do hope that in a way it allowed you to confront the truth and find better and more sustainable ways to improve your health.</p>

        <p>I've never had any of those diseases, and I'm not going to live my life in fear.
