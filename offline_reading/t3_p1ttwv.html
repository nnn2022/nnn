    <strong>Reaching out</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I am making this post to try and understand.</p>
<p>I am very much in the pro-vaccine bubble, but with people in my family voicing concerns. </p>
<p>I understand the reserves that many, in my family and in this sub, have expressed concerning the vaccine, especially concerning how quickly it was ready, and how obviously it is being pushed (full propaganda that's for sure). </p>
<p>But I am trying to think from a state manegement point of view : how to avoid loosing an important proportion of your population to a pandemic, and how to reduce as much as possible the economic falldown, that we are likely to feel for many years to come?</p>
<p>It sounds to me like the vaccine is the best shot (no pun intended), not as the best solution, or safest, but as the least worst solution, after balancing out the advantages and risks of that choice.</p>
<p>This is my current reflexion. Let me know what you think, I am curious of hearing an opinion that is not fundamentally full anti-vax.</p></p>

        <p>But the "vaccine" does not create sterlizing immunity which means you can still catch and spread Covid.</p>
<p>You realize what that means?</p>
<p>If everyone had the "vaccine" day 1, like before March2020, nothing would be different...in fact there is high probability it would be worse.</p>
<p>Let's look at the "Official Numbers" (inflated as they may be):</p>
<ul>
<li>1 in 10 infected by Covid</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so how can someone never infected by Covid (9 out of 10) magically have it show up in their body and modify into a variant?</p>
<p>It is more likely that an ineffective vaccine promoted the creation of viral mutations aka variants.</p>

        <p>I had indeed assumed that the vaccine had the same effect as natural infection, thank you so much for correcting me and sharing this link!</p>
<p>"Okay, so how can someone never infected by Covid (9 out of 10) magically<br>
 have it show up in their body and modify into a variant?"</p>
<p>I am sorry, I don't think I understood : from what I understand, variants happen when the virus finds a host, replicates itself and throught this process mutates, hences the variants. Who is claiming that variants come out of these 9/10 individuals?</p>
<p>I then get the point about ineffective vaccine possibly participating in the creation of new variants.</p>

        <p>I probably phrased that wrong, thanks for the callout üôèsticking to "Official Numbers":</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only 11% of Americans have been infected with Covid since January 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50% of America is vaccinated</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So it is already a statistical improbabilty to get it (nearly 1 in 10), and you're more likely to have something inside of you to create variants if you're injected with it than if you just go about your life.</p>
<p><em>it's a stretch I realize haha. But what IS NOT a stretch are the OFFICIAL codings and protocols that heathcare industry uses, which is riddled with assumptions:</em>
<em>just know that the Convid vax does not create sterilizing immunity in the individual, so one will potentially infect you as one's body has now become a viral warehouse which could never have curbed a pandemic to begin with.</em> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p><strong>Case Diagnosis: ICD Codes U07.1/U07.2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>assumptions = diagnostic test</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/covid19/en/</p>
<p>&rt;An emergency ICD-10 code of ‚ÄòU07.2 COVID-19, virus not identified‚Äô is assigned to a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 <strong>where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Both U07.1 and U07.2 <strong>may be used for mortality coding as cause of death.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic test (PCR)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>assumes the remainder of sequencing (based on computer models aka Sanger Shot-Gun Method which translates to a "platform approach" later, which sequences over actual isolation)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contact Tracing (Interim-ID-01, Interim-ID-02)</strong></p>
<p>(This was on this site, but got scrubbed in April 2020):</p>
<p>https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/</p>
<ul>
<li>CSTE will assume all untested targets during contact tracing are asymptomatic and will be counted as a postive case</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>(see above)</em> U07.1/U07.2 can be used in mortality statistics...</li>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> the entire foundation is based off assumptions which falsely and MASSIVELY inflate the case and death count.</p>

        <p>I get it now, thanks!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Indeed, if it is confirmed that vaccines can spawn new variants, we may have made our problem worse.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I can understand why, in contact tracing, untested targets would be assumed positive, but to add them in the count definitly inflates it artificially.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you very much for all this info! :)</p>

        <p>Yes it totally makes sense to inflate the case count, which the CDC said is common in epidemiology to prepare for a worst case scenario.</p>
<p>What doesn't make sense is to have MSM run a ticker of Provisional Numbers and pretend they are reality.</p>
<p>It makes me think of any typical doomsday movie and what the government would never do:</p>
<p>"In 26 days, the Earth will experience a catastrophic impact that will end all life as we know it"</p>
<p>The panic ensuing from that statement would be mind boggling, except they declare that everyday now which makes it obvious (to me) that this is an agenda and has nothing to do with safety or health.</p>

        <p>The variants will emerge in vaccinated individuals because the vaccine does not prevent infection. The vaccine is only 39 percent effective in preventing infection currently. I posted another comment in this post with a lot of links including to this statistic. If someone who is vaccinated gets covid, the vaccine induced antibodies will exert pressure on the virus to mutate more than someone who does not have any antibodies. This same phenomenon  occurs when antibiotic treatment results in antibiotic resistant bacterial strains or super bugs. Here is a quote from one of the articles I listed in my other comment:</p>
<p>&rt;If you don‚Äôt have these pathogens evolving in response to vaccines, then we really don‚Äôt understand natural selection.</p>
<p>If antibiotics or vaccines do not fully and quickly eradicate the pathogen, it creates the perfect scenario for these pathogens to evolve against the antibiotic or vaccine. Over time, this has the potential to lead to a very deadly pandemic rather than a pandemic with a 99 percent survival rate. Since vaccines are only created <strong>after</strong> the emergence of a specific strain, we will be perpetually one step behind the virus as it evolves.</p>

        <p>Important part of the population? You mean the 80+ people who still have a 94% chance of surviving covid? The people who are mostly retired or nobody hires and collect social security/gov healthcare and are essentially a tax liability? The people who will likely be dead in a decade anyway? </p>
<p>Look, we aren‚Äôt heartless. We have elders we love dearly‚Ä¶but we are also realistic and the vaccine narrative simply isn‚Äôt. </p>
<p>There are a plethora of questions that need answers but lets settle on these:</p>
<p>These vaccines don‚Äôt stop transmission‚Ä¶why then are vaccinated individuals allowed any more freedom of movement than the unvaxxed?  Especially when part of the reason for the lockdowns was to stop asymptomatic spread which the vaxxed facilitate now? </p>
<p>How do we ever obtain herd immunity if transmission is unaffected and breakthrough cases exist? </p>
<p>Why has the government mandated a vaccine that is legally experimental due to its lack of FDA (a government entity) approval which breaks Nuremberg Code?  </p>
<p>Ask your pro-vax family these questions and get back to us.</p>

        <p>It is true that totalitarianism does not happen overnight, it creeps over a society until it holds it, and it is our job to be careful.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But what I fail to understand is : who would gain political advantage from a pandemic ? The pharmaceutical companies, I understand. Politically, it sounds like a terrible long term strategy to create such a huge economic turmoil (barely a decade after the last one), social inequalities, to gain... more political power?</p>

<p>Once again, many people seem to think I came here to annoy you. I did not. I am looking to break my own bias and echo chamber. Thank you for your input! :)</p>

        <p>"But I am trying to think from a state manegement point of view : how to avoid loosing an important proportion of your population to a pandemic, and how to reduce as much as possible the economic falldown, that we are likely to feel for many years to come?"</p>
<p>Low IQ.</p>
<p>90% of all deaths were 75+. All sinks of economy, not sources. In fact, their deaths would free up massive inheritance booms and cause a mini golden-age. Like the boomers had.</p>
<p>Important proportion?</p>
<p>All the old and infirmed with comorbidities soon to die anyway?</p>
<p>Your argument isn't even consistent or logical, let alone factual.</p>

        <p>State involvement is alway a debate, and a necessary one.</p>
<p>Thing is, what kind of organisation could take care of an emergency situation like a pandemic? I do not pretend the state to be all-knowing, but I wouldn't exactly trust John from down the street with my life neither.</p>

<p>I understand your point, although I am not sure how moral it is, but hey, I would not pretend moral is ever used or even known in the upper echelons of the government.</p>
<p>If it was not to save lives, what would your undertanding of this political manoeuvre be from your standpoint?</p>
