    <strong>Discriminatory Work policies in regard to Vaccination status</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all, using a throwaway for this.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My friend has been forced to wear a mask at his job for the entirety of this scamdemic. There is not much other work he could do as he does not have a car and this is the only nearby place to work for him, so this is his only lifeline to economic semi-stability. Despite the mask stifling his breath in the fast-paced job he has to work, he has put up with it so far out of necessity.</p>
<p>Until now, all employees were forced to wear masks. As of next week however, the company has now decided to go with a new policy. If you show proof to corporate that you have gotten the emergency use, un-approved, experimental injection, you are now able to go mask-less at work. If you do not do this, you are forced to wear a mask. So now the job site will have both masked and unmasked people, and if you are seen wearing a mask, it will be known by all coworkers/management/customers that you did NOT get the injection, which could lead to harassment. He has chosen to not get this vaccination or any other vaccination as his body is his temple and he does not want any man-made substances directly injected into his body, bypassing the natural immune defenses and normal route of foreign substance incorporation into the body.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How is it legal for a company to give different treatment to its employees based on medical information/potential religious discrimination/disability discrimination/pregnancy discrimination? I do not see how this policy could possibly stay in place. He has already been treated differently by his coworkers, who all got the injection, because they continually asked him what designer brand of injection he got, and the obvious declining to answer left only the fact that the injection was not taken to be apparent by them.</p></p>

<p>2) If anyone else at work isn’t wearing a mask, you don’t have to either.</p>

        <p>As a private business they likely have significant discretion over their own policies. There are federal and likely state statutes that state you can’t discriminate on the basis of race, religion, etc. but it’s unlikely that vaccination status is included there.</p>

        <p>But if your vaccination status is dependent upon religious beliefs, or disability status, or whether or not you are pregnant/trying to get pregnant, does it not become discriminatory? </p>
<p>The company is allowing people with different religious beliefs that allow them to get the vaccine better treatment (allowing them to not have to muzzle themselves) versus someone with other religious beliefs that now has to wear the mask. Or in the instance of disability, that disabled person who can not get the vaccine is being forced to wear a mask whereas their other coworkers can go free. </p>
<p>Mandating injections directly into peoples bodies as terms of employment is true insanity and a legal can of worms, and a sign of the end of freedom.</p>

        <p>Isn't it against the law for them to ask for your medical records? Ie they can't ask you for the proof. </p>
<p>So if someone else doesn't have to wear it then you don't have to either and they can't ask you to prove it. I think that's how it works anyway</p>
