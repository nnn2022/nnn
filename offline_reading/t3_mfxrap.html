        <p>You can read more about it here (link in Spanish): <a href="https://www.salamanca24horas.com/texto-diario/mostrar/2812356/video-polemica-actuacion-policial-fiesta-ilegal-domicilio-correcto-agentes-tiren-puerta-abajo">https://www.salamanca24horas.com/texto-diario/mostrar/2812356/video-polemica-actuacion-policial-fiesta-ilegal-domicilio-correcto-agentes-tiren-puerta-abajo</a></p>
<p>The National Police recently intervened in the illegal party that a score of young people were celebrating in a Madrid apartment, and it did so through a performance that has generated much controversy in forums and social networks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because the agents knocked down the door of the house with a ram after the refusal of the assistants to let them access. In fact, the young people recorded the police action of the agents, which took place at dawn last Sunday, March 21, on Lagasca street in Madrid.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The video shows how a young woman, who claims to be a law student, asks the policeman behind the door for her identification number. After telling him, the agent warns him that the door will be knocked down if he does not open. "Get the court order, please," she replies, who also asks: "You will already know what the police status you are subject to, right? Perfect, because I don't have to remind you of your duties and obligations" .</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the officers slam down the door as the policeman had told them. The police officers detained nine of the young people who participated in the party for alleged crimes of disobedience and resistance to authority. They also sanctioned 14 of them for non-compliance with sanitary measures. Most of the members are of foreign nationality, except for three, who are Spanish.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Was it a tight performance and in accordance with the law?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The policing has generated much debate on social media and other internet circles, and the video has been shared at full speed. The well-known criminal lawyer, José María de Pablo, very active in social networks, has reacted to the video by pointing out that the police action corresponds to a crime of trespassing in competition with the crime of damages (by the door).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Bad for the protagonist, who organized an illegal party. Good for exercising her right not to open the door to the police without a court order. Very bad for the agents who violated a home without a warrant. Very good for the protagonist for recording it on video "sums up the lawyer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Luisa María Gómez, the president of the social chamber of the Superior Court of Justice of Castilla-La Mancha, the video has made her "hair stand on end" and has reminded the police that she must "take special care in the actions of she". Likewise, she predicts that these events will cause "serious problems" for these agents.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But there are other opinions, also from lawyers and police groups. In fact, the Twitter account that uploads the video to the network (@FuerzasDelOrden), justifying the actions of the agents, affirms that it is a crime of serious disobedience that is captured by the agents, so the action would be in accordance to the right as it is a flagrant crime.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In fact, Vozpópuli has had access to the police report written by the agents who acted in the event and which justify their actions because the young people "were committing a flagrant crime of disobedience."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They allege that "there was no other simpler and at the same time effective means to enforce the law." The crime was taking place in the presence of the agents, being clearly perceived by their auditory senses, the perpetrators were inside, without there being a reasonable doubt of their participation in the crime, at least from the police perspective. They explain that there was an "urgent need" to intervene to "prevent the spread of the evil that the criminal offense entails."</p>

<p>This part legit sounds like some kind of ironic comment you'd see in r/ChurchOfCOVID "prevent the spread of the evil" LMFAO.</p>
<p>It is beyond ridiculous, I struggle to find a "democratic" country shittier and more authoritarian than Spain right now.</p>

        <p>What if I told you... this is an every day thing? I live in Spain and watch this "illegal parties" and other crimes in TV every, single, day. People just reunite with others, reaching way more people than the allowed amount, without masks, distance, or following any anti COVID rules. This happens mainly in big cities.</p>

        <p>We're doing what we can here, by making sure to stay safe from the virus. Nevertheless, that isn't the worst thing happening, there has also been people destroying streets and shops recently in big cities. There's not much we can do to stop these kinds of people, other than reporting them to the police. However, my city is small and peaceful compared to those places, so things like that don't happen here.</p>
