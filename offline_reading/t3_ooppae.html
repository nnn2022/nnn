    <strong>"It's the anti-vaxxers fault why we're in lockdown. If we all take the vaccine we can go back to normal"</strong>
    <p><p>This is the ultimate cope, a pathetic one too. There are very few countries, states, provinces, cities, etc. that are just going to simply ALLOW their population to go back to normalcy. They are not going to reward you with anything long term for taking the covid vaccine. As soon as cases rise slightly, they will shut everything down again. It's like how people tease pets with food. They put the food near an animal's face so it thinks it will be able to grab it, and once it lunges forward, the person pulls their arm back so the animal can't reach it, and repeats this action over and over again.</p>
<p>It's a self-destructive attitude. That's why COVID shills are angry and depressed. How would you feel if every day and night you were telling yourself the same lie "if we all take the vaccine we can go back to normal" for the past 17+ months and it never came true. Giving up your rights for "the greater good" and to "save grandma" and you get absolutely nothing in return. COVID shills have convinced themselves of a reality that doesn't exist, never existed, and never will exist and they are mentally paying the consequences for that. They are so mentally deranged that they are advocating for unvaccinated people's deaths via refusing essential medical care... because they want to save lives???... Lol.</p>
<p>As long as there are incompetent leaders and a compliant population, there will be no "going back to normal." I do believe that people will wake up and stop tolerating this nonsense, though it will take a long time. A lot of people are currently content with living in a dystopian, yet decently peaceful society, but there will eventually come a point where people are too angry to just sit around and take it anymore.</p></p>

<p>Worst part is that now they are beginning to realize that vaccinated people can still get and spread Covid. </p>
<p>So am Unvaxed person with antibodies was safer around grandma than they were.</p>

        <p>That is because these gene therapies are not, never were, and never will be a true vaccine that prevents transmission and infection.</p>
<p>Two things that before 2019 were NECESSARY for a shot to be called a vaccine and in the estimation of the majority of doctors is still necessary.</p>

        <p>&rt;The funniest/scariest part is that they genuinely believe that we're the stupid ones for not 'believing in science' or 'understanding how vaccines/masks work.'
&rt;
&rt;They've completely convinced themselves that they're in the right here, and I honestly don't know what, if anything, would change their stance.</p>
<p>to be fair... they were taught that.</p>
<p>they were told over and over that if you don't think masks work, or you have questions about the vaccine, then you're a moron who doesn't understand science.</p>
<p>this whole stereotype we've been thrown under didn't spring up overnight.</p>
<p>I'm not able to articulate all of it but i can see the thread. goes back to Trump or earlier. Maybe not planned but quite a convenient tool. </p>
<p>basically taking the cliche image of a Trumper, built up over years and preceding Trump, and now putting it in the place of someone who doesn't support masks/lockdown.</p>
<p>it's like people were trained to attack this caricature and it just keeps getting recycled for various purposes.</p>
<p>the caricature that is dumb, arrogant, a hick, ignorant; hates science because it confuses him; hates social progress because it threatens him; loves Trump because he was brainwashed to and also because Trump is a crypto-fascist and racist just like him; etc etc.</p>
<p>now he hates masks and vaccines (because anti-science, arrogant and ignorant).</p>
<p>this caricature is, in fact, the only thing standing between the <strong>good</strong> people and utopia.</p>
<p>it's pretty fucked up. I'm amazed more people don't see it but I guess it feels good to assume there's a group of people like that out there just furious at the idea that society is moving on without them.</p>

        <p>&rt;As soon as cases rise slightly, they will shut everything down again.</p>
<p>This is exactly what's happened in my state and it's annoying as hell. Every couple of months when there's a very low infection and/or death rate they slowly lift most of the restrictions. But then after a month or so we have to go back to lockdown whenever a <em>single</em> new case shows up. Over 90% of the time it's due to either foreigners arriving or citizens returning from a trip. The vaccine barely even exists in my country and we're doing just fine without it.</p>

        <p>why vaccines WILL NOT make everything go back to normal.</p>
<p>From "The Australian" (behind paywall):</p>
<p>Delta dawns: not free until kids get jab</p>
<p>"The dangers of the Delta variant will require a rethink <br>
over whether Covid-19 restrictions can be ­permanently relaxed once the <br>
adult population is largely ­vaccinated, health authorities warn."</p>
<p>if you are getting "the jab" because you think it will end all of this you are completely naive. This will never end.</p>

        <p>Coworker of mine has to isolate for two weeks because her daughters daycare had an “outbreak”, even though both parents are fully vaccinated. You think she’s be pissed at the government for not giving her freedoms back, but alas she’s blaming “anti vaxxers” who “haven’t done their part” for them being detained. These people are unwilling to admit they’ve been duped.</p>

        <p>Double vaccinated? I know some vaccinations require two shots so I’m sure that’s what you mean, some people definitely get COVID even with the vaccine and I’m not sure what conditions need to be met for a vaccine to not work, nor am I educated enough about it to speculate. However the vaccinations have absolutely immunized the vast majority of people that have gotten it and driven down the rate of infection drastically</p>

<p>Completely agree with you here, there are fewer deaths because of the vaccines. But they can still get ill. So you'll have lower numbers of hospitalizations, but case numbers might remain the exact same. Especailly when everyone is constantly getting tested.</p>
<p>Sorry I got ahead of myself, if you meant deaths you were correct, if you meant cases, maybe not.</p>

        <p>On the CDC website it seems out of the 101 million fully vaccinated people 10,262 people reported getting COVID, 2,775 were asymptomatic, 995 people were hospitalized and 160 people died, and among the hospitalized 289 were asymptomatic or in the hospital for different reasons. it certainly seems like a good turn out for effective immunity though. It also says these “breakthrough” cases are expected when the majority of people aren’t immunized.</p>

        <p>Hmm I think it’s valid, but we don’t currently know what the long term affects could be, like how chicken pox can turn into shingles 40 years down the line or so. There have also been cases where people have still gotten the disease even after they once had it, probably not dissimilar to vaccinated people getting the disease.</p>
