    <strong>My friend caught covid from her double jabbed friend</strong>
    <p><p>My friend was incredibly sick for a week, she was crying on the phone to me because her whole body was in so much pain, she sounded like a wheezing old man and could hardly speak. She has never been so sick in her life. She got this sickness from her friend who got double jabbed and promptly caught "covid" and was bedridden around the same time my friend fell ill (her friend did a PCR test and it was positive, i know the PCR tests are bullshit but still)</p>
<p>So, this friend of mine who has travelled and never gave a shit about covid suddenly caught it from her "vaccinated" friend. The "delta variant" is the vaccine variant. This vaccine is spreading "covid". My, my, my, i wonder when the penny will drop for the sheeple. Its taking a mighty long time but it seems the indoctrinated zombies are starting to slowly pry open their eyes and smell the coffee. I wonder how this will all unfold for them in the next few months and years. Oh us "anti-vaxxers" arent looking so "stupid" anymore. I would be mighty scared if I was a sheep and had succumbed to the brainwash and peer pressure of wanting to follow the "herd" and injected the mystery potion. How is that "herd" immunity working out? This would all be a comedy if it werent so tragic.</p></p>
