    <strong>How do you feel about the COVID vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, I’m a health professions student developing a podcast and am very open minded. I’d really like to try to get a grasp on why people are against vaccines on a personal level. Please comment your thoughts on the vaccine. I’m looking to interview people that are hesitant about or even entirely against vaccines for a non-partisan podcast show about health behaviors. It is a judgement free conversation. Please let me know if anyone is willing to speak on the show, I will not include names or any personal identifying information.</p></p>

        <p>I am not against the covid vaccines. I am against any sort of bribery or coercion to force people to get them.  I am against the emergency authorization for healthy children, since covid is not emergency for them, and it’s completely unethical to give children a vaccine  to benefit others.</p>

        <p>I think my personal risk to have a rare extreme effect from covid is less than my personal risk to taking a brand new still in trial vaccine and getting a rare extreme side effect.</p>
<p>I’m sure both are way less than a fraction of 1% chance.</p>

        <p>Didn't trust the supposed experts before covid, why would I trust them after? You see, I have been through that industry, and seen the corruption. You're a point blank moron to think they have the answers for this with this gene therapy garbage. You can stick that vaxx up fraudci's microscopic dick hole.</p>

        <p>Very open to talking via chat, not so much via voice. </p>
<p>I have zero issues with vaccines, I have an issue with experimental gene therapy. But the distrust has developed over time. Initially my fear wasn’t about the vaccine, it was about a left wing push that vaccine distribution should be based on race and that the US would be footing the bill for vaccines all over the world while their own citizens wait for one. That concern is long gone.</p>
<p>When I realized that we had been lied to from the start about everything, I had no reason to trust a single thing that was said about this. When my fears that this was 100% political were confirmed when the WHO changed their guidelines on 1/20/21 to start lowering numbers the moment Biden took office, when Fauci was allowed to get away with nonsense at congressional hearings (“I can’t see the graphic” “people in Texas and Florida locked down after they were told they didn’t need to and people in CA and other northern states didn’t follow the lockdowns”) I had no reason to trust anything going on. Even the news about Hydroxychloroquine &amp; Azithromycin, something that was laughed at when Trump pushed it, was found to be true. We’ve lost 2 years of our lives (at least) for a political party to take over.</p>

        <p>No vaccine in history has ever been pushed the way the covid vaccine has. Very suspicious. All of the censorship is a huge red flag for me. Seeing all the celebrities push it, the million dollar lottery’s, the free junk food. I was always told don’t take drugs from strangers and these strangers are extremely dangerous and untrustworthy. </p>
<p>This is all about the great reset. It’s pretty obvious at this point.</p>

        <p>I’ll just leave my thoughts here in this thread- I have a few different reasons why I’m not interested. </p>
<p>The first is that I genuinely don’t think I need it. I’m young and healthy, and my family already had covid in January. Both my parents still have antibodies as of a few weeks ago. I feel that I likely already had covid, and even if I somehow didn’t get it from them (we live together), I have no fear of getting covid somewhere else. It would very likely have little effect on me other than just being like a bad cold. As for the risk of spreading it, other people have the option to be vaccinated and protect themselves now. There is nobody at this point that isn’t able to get a shot if they want it. It’s their choice and their responsibility if they’re worried.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’m very alarmed by the messaging attached to this vaccine. Never in my life have I seen a vaccine pushed on society to such a degree. To threaten people with losing their job, not being able to attend college, and in some places not be allowed to go to any events without some vaccine passport... That makes me think this vaccine isn’t about helping people but controlling them. I’ve never been asked to show vaccine proof for a flu shot, or any other shots as an adult in order to do anything. If vaccination protects you, why does it matter is everyone else gets it? Getting vaccinated is the same as getting a medical treatment, and that is always a personal health decision. Never should it be a government’s decision to make for you.</p>
<p>Finally, I have been researching people’s reactions to the vaccine from when the first shots were given out. What I’ve found has been very alarming. Young and healthy people like me are winding up with blood clots, strokes, and sometimes even dying. The ones who are luckier are still made sick with constant headaches, vertigo, and body aches for days and sometimes even weeks. That is not normal to me at all. None of the shots I had as a child caused me any side effects like that. I was good as new after getting them, while people are needing to call out of work for days after getting their covid shot. I personally know people who have felt sick, tired, and/or in pain ever since their shot weeks or months ago. I don’t think enough safety testing has been done on these covid vaccines. Those side effects aren’t acceptable or worth it to me for a virus that I have a 99.99% chance of surviving. I also have no idea what the long term health effects are for anyone who has had these covid vaccines. Nobody does, and they won’t know until years down the line. No shot has ever been pushed on all of society after only one year of trials. I’m not willing to be a guinea pig while people find out what happens.</p>
