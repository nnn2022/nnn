    <strong>Just Another Vent</strong>
    <p><p>My family has gone insane. Deep down I knew we would not be getting together for the holidays this year, but for some reason I had my hopes up that maybe they'd change their minds since it has been a year since we've seen each other and this COVID hysteria is neverending. But no, not only are they refusing to get together, but they are actually angry at other families who are. They are literally pissed that people are planning to have Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners together! It blows my mind.</p>
<p>All the time. All the freaking time I hear about rising cases, rising deaths, how Trump is Satan incarnate and only archangel savior Biden can save us, how people are science-denying morons who lack critical thinking skills because they don't automatically believe everything that Lord Fauci and the "real experts" say.  They're angry about Trump rallies being superspreaders but have never mentioned the mass Biden celebrations. They were all over voter fraud in 2016 when Trump won but do not believe it's possible now that Biden won. They think anyone who is not a blind Biden supporter is sucking Trumps balls on the daily. They're only okay with the fact that some people will deny the vaccines because that means more vaccines for them. They share mask memes that basically say anyone who refuses to wear a mask is a selfish mass murdering asshole. They are angry that there are people out there who are still living their lives normally and they assume most of those people are deranged "Trumpers". A couple of them are extroverts and are falling into a depression from the lack of social contact after strictly following all of the rules for the past 8+ months, and they are furious at all the selfish "noncompliant" people who are carrying this out forever. </p>
<p>And you can't convince them otherwise. Saying anything to the contrary will not sway them at all. It'll only piss them off. I was accused by a family member of watching Fox news. She said I do not understand the situation because I'm not watching the news every night like she does. She watches CNN every night and is constantly riled up about everything they say. She said the news said that there is a lot of misinformation out there and companies like Facebook are trying to remove it but haven't been successful at removing everything, so all my information must be from "misinformation" sources, and I need to be careful. I tried convincing her that her sources could be misinformation as well and that many experts are being silenced, but she insists that her sources of CNN, NBC, and Time Magazine are the official authority and everything else is lies. She literally told me I need to watch TV more often to get accurate information. I am banging my head against a wall!</p></p>

        <p>Yes, I voted for Trump, but that was more because "he ain't Biden and I like presidents who don't start wars for the sake of it", I'm not a Trump supporter by any means.</p>
<p>I question the "science" because the science is declared by swamp politicians who do not want in your favor, they just want money in their pockets and they won't stop at anything.</p>

        <p>These are people who would sell you out to the Stasi, or Gestapo or whatever other secret police they enact to go around and arrest people who want to be free. Family or not, I will not associate with blind rule/order followers and you shouldn't either. Get as far away from them as you can. Let them rat out each other.</p>
