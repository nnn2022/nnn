        <p>They always take it back to January to provide a false perspective, 95% of the population were probably unvaccinated then and 100% of hospital admissions would have been unvaccinated</p>
<p>Lets start seeing some data from June onwards to get a more realistic view</p>
<p>Oh and its always worth remembering , one shot is now classed as unvaccinated in most cases and anyone who got covid within two weeks of any treatment is not included as a vaccinated person</p>

        <p>Exactly. If the gene juice was that effective, they wouldn’t have to keep lying and omitting truths</p>

        <p>The other part that cracks me up about this “article” is this: </p>
<p>“And between April 1 and July 3, just 21.3% of deaths among people who had COVID-19 involved people who had already received one or both doses, depending on which vaccine they received, according to the department. The department noted that the percentage of deaths among people who had or had not been vaccinated involved people who died with COVID-19, but not necessarily due to COVID-19.”</p>
<p>So basically anybody who died after April who had COVID were included in these BS statistics!</p>
