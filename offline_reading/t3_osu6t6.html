    <strong>I know its petty but I don't really feel like shopping certain places anymore</strong>
    <p><p>This entire past 18 months has been a giant shit show. And the way some stores chose to ignore ADA LAW and blatantly enforce masks when federal law says you must obey ADA really irks me.  </p>
<p>I want to wander around a book store so much but both barnes and noble AND half price books were dicks about 'mask' policy that i  can not even stomach going to either one.  half price books actually yelled at me to 'leave' if i wasn't wearing a mask (and they wonder why small businesses are failing).</p>
<p>Most other places I could simply say 'medical' and I was left alone and my kids were left alone.  But no I don't want 'car side' pick up, i don't want to use your website, i want to shop in your store like a regular human.</p>
<p>Now we are no-masks required and I'm getting all the emails, the discounts, the 'we miss you' nonsense and honestly as much as I want to go back, i don't.  </p>
<p>I seem to do just fine with amazon, target, walmart (ugh) and a few other places that were very welcoming to the ADA LAW.</p>
<p>We also never renewed costco - a whole different level of crazy happened there and I seem to be managing just fine w/o them. Yes costco was semi- convenient for large packaging but the lines were insane, if im aware of grocery store sales and the clearance section I can do better than costco pricing.  I know it just one family that didn't renew costco but if you treat your customers like shit, they won't return.</p></p>

        <p>I still haven’t been back to the grocery store that wouldn’t touch my reusable bags and instead stood there while I bagged my own groceries, holding up the line. That was over a year ago. I haven’t been to Trader Joe’s in about two years because of their attitude towards Covid, and making people wait outside as if they were trying to get into a club. </p>
<p>I quit the gym when they began mandating masks while working out. I told myself I’d go back once those were dropped. Now they are, but I don’t miss the gym at all. </p>
<p>I don’t want to shop somewhere if the business looks at me like some filthy inconvenience they have to tolerate.</p>

        <p>I loved trader joes, they have allergy safe foods, but sadly I found other places and replacements for those foods. I vowed never to set foot inside that store again.</p>
<p>I do have kudos for the following places that were extremely accommodating with the mask nonsense: kroger/frys, tjmaxx/marshalls/homegoods, (most) targets, walmart, amazon delivery was amazing and I started leaving water bottles and snacks for the delivery person which they appreciated!, QT gas station.</p>
<p>I was going to sign my kids up for some programs again but we are being very selective in which studios/gyms we pick.  If you were a jerk, we are not signing with you. </p>
<p>**just because I 'look' fine does not mean I am fine, you can not look at someone and know if they have anxiety, panic, asthma or any other reason to be exempt from a mask, you have zero idea if a mask will make then seize, vomit, have a flashback, cry uncontrollably, cause a skin reaction or anything else.   Whatever health issues I or my kids have are none of a stores concern. The fact I even have to say 'medical exempt' is outside the stores knowledge.</p>

        <p>It's not petty. If businesses (mostly small business owners) would rather side with the government (which I guess all big box stores probably do) and follow these absurd mask mandates and social distancing threats then I have would have zero problem shopping somewhere else.... Im curious how many ppl commenting on various posts see either from other countries or the US. What's the ratio?</p>

        <p>this is NOT fair and equal and curbside does not allow me to fully 'shop' your store, i do not have equal access to your clearance racks, to your special in store unadvertised sales, my kids do not get to experience the social growth of shopping and learning how to make choices etc.   If I wanted my kids on screens all day I would not be purchasing BOOKS.</p>
