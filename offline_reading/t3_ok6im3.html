    <strong>Let us play a guessing game. What do you think, if you perform 1.100.000 rapid tests in schools and then do PCR tests to confirm the positive tests, how many "infected" children will you find?</strong>
    <p><p>To add some context to the question, in Germany every school in every federal state demands that all children must be tested. Sometimes once a week, sometimes twice a week. After the summer break, there is talk about three mandatory tests per week. </p>
<p>The federal state of Hessen officially announced today the results of the tests that were taken last week. There the children get tested twice a week.</p>
<p>So what is your guess, out of 1.100.000 rapid tests, how many were positive? And how many of the positive rapid tests were actually confirmed to be PCR positive?</p>
<p>Answer in Spoiler</p>
<p>&rt;!Out of 1.100.000 rapid tests, 146 were positive.
Out of 146 positive rapid tests, 34 were PCR positive (76,71% false-positive)
34 PCR positives from 1.100.000 rapid tests are 0,0031%

        <p>Of course you get no answer to this. How many of the children really had symptoms, which symptoms and if they were bad is a good hidden secret. You do not want that people ask to many questions.</p>

        <p>According to the statistics and data of past 'cases' from 18 months:</p>
<p><strong>3-7% will be 'positive' as determined from a PCR Test.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>This means the majority, the overwhelming majority of even those tested, are</strong> <strong><em>perfectly healthy people</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Healthy = 'free from infection' - yet THEY are all locked down, having their lives and livelihoods, freedoms and dignities being destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>99% of that number will be 'asymptomatic'</strong>, as the PCR test only found presence of related 'viral material' and <em>"cannot determine whether it is live, dead, present or past infection."</em></p>
<p>Because of this, the <strong>99% will simply be sent home with no further treatment, and instructed to 'stay home for 14 days'.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, their 'cases' and all the names they fill out on contact tracing forms will be added to the 'case' numbers as 'presumed cases' = 'cases' = 'cases' + 'presumed cases'.</p>
<p>The <strong>1% that are considered 'symptomatic' or 'active'</strong>, will then be passed on to doctors who will further diagnose them, and some may require hospitalization.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the 1% will be 66+ years of age and above with 3-4 underlying pre-existing conditions, such as already having the flu/influenza, respiratory illness, hypertension, and/or diabetes (Says the CDC)</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 1% of that 1% <strong>(0.01% of all 'active' cases) will find themselves in the ICU</strong> or advanced care.</p>
<p>The lowest reported Recovery Rate is 94%, and that was in the age group of 90+ with 3-4 pre-existing conditions, that led to death 'involving covid19', and really depends on how the death certificate is filled out for interpretation.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since 'deaths' have been used to describe a threat from covid19, because they peaked back in April/May 2020, and haven't changed much since, but 'cases' skyrocketed/surged/upticked/etc since September 2020 when Mask mandates and widespread lockdowns and restrictions were put in place.. driving more fear so that more people got tested.</p>
<p>Formula of fear: More fear = more testing = more 'cases' = more lockdowns =  more fear = more testing = more 'cases', etc.</p>
<p>Florida and Texas decided another strategy: Open up.</p>
<p>Their formula:  Less fear = less testing = less 'cases'  = less lockdowns = less fear = less testing = less 'cases' etc.</p>
