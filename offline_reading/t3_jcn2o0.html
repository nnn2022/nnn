        <p>Social media is big part of the problem.</p>
<p>The votes don't mean anything other than "I don't like the person and/or the content". </p>
<p>It simplifies something that is so complex and dynamic as human interaction into something dumbed down and meaningless.</p>

        <p>They don't care about the implications. They care only about maintaining their status as the couch potato heroes. This is all they will ever achieve in their lives and evidence threatens to take it from them, then what will they be? Permanent shut-ins wearing increasingly grimy pieces of cloth over their faces with no government hand out checks. That's what. </p>

        <p>I actually think there's a lot more otherwise normal people that don't want their belief system crumbled.</p>
<p>They are not really at fault. Problems always come from the top. It's the incompetent/malignant leaders that's the problem. It includes governors, presidents, prime ministers, high level managers, top level doctors.</p>
<p>(Their belief system is based on their leaders, media, being all trustworthy)</p>

        <p>There are very few "normal" people. Unless we define "normal" as "retarded" in which case you might be right.</p>
<p>It is not "normal" to blindly follow a bunch of idiots off a cliff like lemmings and to admire the view on the way down. </p>
<p>It is absolutely their fault. They live in the information age. While big tech may be helping to create a narrative of fear - anyone can see that 750 million got sick and only 1 million died for themselves on the WHO website, for example, and thus, anyone can discern the truth. They don't because they are lazy and stupid and they do not have my sympathy - any more than the cow that produces my steak has my sympathy. </p>
<p>At least the cow doesn't cause any harm before it feeds me.</p>

        <p>Yep. That's what I mean by normal.</p>
<p>By statistical standards, the 70-80% of those that act that way are normal. It takes effort to get out of it.</p>
<p>Individually we humans show brilliance, but as a whole we are not much different than animals. The only real difference our intellect affords us is to build bigger buildings.</p>
<p>Yes those normal people are the same ones that act like sheep. Still the fault has to be traced to the source, and that's the leaders.</p>
<p>Ideally we can get all people to be united to be AGAINST the government so they can be replaced. But look at us now. Divided. That's what they want.</p>

        <p>I don't want to be governed. We could manage a common economic cooperation to cover things like healthcare, education (though it needs urgent reform to be anything like fit for purpose), defense, etc. but no more "leaders". I am capable of making my own mistakes, I am not having people make them for me anymore - and this needs those standing against tyranny to pick up a gun instead of prattling about how violence never solved anything, when, in fact, it's the only thing that ever solved anything.</p>

        <p>I jumped through the roof yesterday, when I learned about the study in question with an inexcusable three week delay. The study is well done and the results for the test group are convincing. </p>
<p>There is one problematic detail though, the choice of the test subjects makes the study less representative. They all work at the same company, and Covid-19 is known to spread most efficiently in the workplaces. So even though this group of people achieved community immunity in a matter of weeks, the results aren't necessarily transferable to the rest of the country or even just Tokyo.</p>
<p>I am sure though that Japan, with the sane policy of openness that they are implementing, will be over the pandemics sooner than the countries run by authoritarian doomers.</p>

        <p>There was a survey by the japanese health ministry in early june which showed only 0.1 % in tokyo had antibodies, in osaka it was 0.17 %.<a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/16/national/science-health/tokyo-coronavirus-antibodies/">https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/16/national/science-health/tokyo-coronavirus-antibodies/</a></p>
<p>The link in your OP is about the second wave a bit later than early june but the gap from 0.1 to over 40 - 50 % is so huge that it would require an explaination how this would be possible. Also in your link is stated that they started at a positive rate of 5.8 % in end of may/early june which would be also a big difference than the results from the health gov survey.</p>

        <p>nice article find thanks. I will file that away.</p>
<p>Of course...after June - decent sized wave as you note.</p>

<p>I'm of a thought that IT is latent and will rise &amp; fall depending on individual health of populace, which is influenced by enviro factors and individual health (Like low obesity being one factor).  The incubation time could indeed be much longer. So  you "acquire" IT today, it may replicate very slowly until it makes you sick...a year? Longer? Never?</p>
<p>We'll see Nov-Mar.</p>
<p>Personally.. I don't think "absolute" herd immunity exists. I'm not even sure partial exists. I wouldn't depend on it for my health. I would focus on my individual health....</p>
<p>But that's what the article says...</p>

        <p>Yeah the second wave in japan is also interesting in that regard that it has not the same curve as the first one. In mid april they had the highest reported case numbers at around 600-700 cases per day but only one month later in mid may it was down to around only 30-40 cases per day.</p>
<p>In the second wave they had the highest numbers in early august with around 1500 cases per day but now  two months later it seems to be stuck at around 500-600 reported cases everyday for over a month now.</p>
<p>But the study from my link and yours one has one overlapping timeframe in early june with the big difference from 0.1 to 5.8 %. One could think it is maybe because of different testing machines used but if if the accuracy would be so signifcantly different which study can then be believed?</p>
<p>I would think these question also turned up in japan but unfortunately western and japanese media are too far away from each other to find such news/articles.</p>

<p>I have detected a slight rise in Japan's cases. You can see it here. Prob wouldn't see it with WHO or Worldometers..too small. But with this website you can. </p>

        <p>For japan I  just sometimes visit their public founded media station site.  <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/special/coronavirus/data-all/">https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/special/coronavirus/data-all/#graph--mhlw__severe</a>. The first two graphs are showing new reported cases and deaths. </p>
<p>The next blue one shows the severe ill patients even though I cant tell whats the definition is of it I would guess something like ICU patients. The next one with around 5000 as number is the number of people in hospital/treatment. Then the released persons with around 84000 as number. </p>
<p>The last graph with the pcr testing number shows a big increase of testing after the first wave which happened in a lot of countries in that way.</p>

<p>Thxs for the explanation. Can see the same rise on there...almost imperceptible. Only the next few weeks / month or so will reveal if that persists.</p>

        <p>I also have a link to an interesting graph for the number of deaths per week for my homecountry germany. <a href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Querschnitt/Corona/_Grafik/_Interaktiv/woechentliche-sterbefallzahlen-jahre.html;jsessionid=94E5CE95C2AF18C0B7C820F4BDE0857C.internet8721?nn=209016">https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Querschnitt/Corona/_Grafik/_Interaktiv/woechentliche-sterbefallzahlen-jahre.html;jsessionid=94E5CE95C2AF18C0B7C820F4BDE0857C.internet8721?nn=209016</a></p>
<p>It is the offical statistic dept. of germany so an official source. 2018 was a pretty bad year with a lot of exceeding deaths in the beginning of the year because of a very bad flu season back then. The worst week in 2018 was week 10 with 26 777 deaths compared to the worst week in 2020 in week 14 with 20 624. In general 2020 looks like it will be a kind of average year in terms of death in germany.</p>
<p>For a good overview for several european countries there is <a href="https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps">https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps</a> which tracks deaths. Maybe you know this site already. Most countries had a spike during weeks from 11-18. Now we are in a kind of similar situation again. Our neighbouring countries report high new case numbers and are implenting some lockdown style measures while we in germany are still relatively loose on it. Like in march when other countries in europe had a faster and stricter lockdown than we had (well some people dont even call it a lockdown here because it was rather tame here) but ended with much higher cases and deaths. Seems like it is repating itself again.</p>
<p>ICU patients are on a rise here too. Now at 730 compared to about 300 during september. Nothing which would be uncontrollable right now but there is definately the fear that it will lead this time to a worse result compared to the first wave.</p>

        <p>That's interesting...2017-2018 was also a high flu mortality year in the USA. And UK if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p>Yes, aware of Euromomo. </p>
<p>Expecting larger future waves. Maybe smaller waves interspersed....we'll see. One thing is for sure - this will not be like 1918 - which had 3 waves.</p>
<p>Yes, reading stories of ICUs filling up all over.</p>

        <p>Just tonight on CBC (Canadian national news) they had a segment trying to denounce herd immunity working with COVID-19 <em>until</em> we get a vaccine! Imagine that.</p>
<p>They must have caught wind of this story and had to get some B.S. out ahead of time to denounce the legitimacy of it to anyone who might stumble upon it. Gotta keep everyone in control I guess.</p>
