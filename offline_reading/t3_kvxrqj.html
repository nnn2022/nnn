    <strong>Masks harm schoolchildren. Study of 25,000 children.</strong>
    <p><p>.Real life study: Masked schoolchildren are harmed physically, psychologically, behaviorally and suffer from 24 distinct health issues

<p>(Natural News) A first-of-its-kind study, involving over 25,000 children, reveals that masks are harming schoolchildren in many physical and psychological ways and have a negative effect on their behavior, focus and interest in learning. These negative effects are censored from social media, under-reported by the media, and ignored by government officials. Of the 25,930 children studied, the database includes at least 17,854 health complaints submitted by parents. These health issues and impairments were observed in approximately 68 percent of masked schoolchildren who were forced to wear a face covering for an average of four and a half hours per day.</p>
<p>The registry, established on October 20th, 2020, asked 363 doctors to inform parents and teachers that they can report the health impacts they are witnessing from prolonged mask use of children. The health issues were exhaustive and included irritability (60%), headache (53%), difficulty concentrating (50%), less happiness (49%), reluctance to go to school/kindergarten (44%), malaise (42%) impaired learning (38%) and drowsiness or fatigue (37%).” Nearly a third of the children sleep worse than normal, and quarter of the children had developed new fears. Hundreds of children were less cheerful, less playful and most were unusually irritable.</p>
<p>Even more concerning, (29.7%) had shortness of breath, (26.4%) experienced dizziness, and hundreds of children suffered from feelings of weakness, a feeling of disease, accelerated respiration, tightness in the chest, and short-term impairment of consciousness. Universal mask wearing is destroying the health of children, making their immune system more susceptible to disease....</p></p>

        <p>This is very obvious to people who can actually think for themselves - but the fact checkers think masks work.    They might work for short periods of time if they are clean but nobody, especially kids, can properly wear clean masks for 8 hours a day or more.</p>

        <p>haha true. i’m open minded but partly i saw that url as a liability in terms of sharing it with doomer friends or family, and stopped reading.   I expect more and more of these findings to come out as we get further from march 2020s panic.</p>

        <p>Yeah when I see unknown sites like this I usually check them for links to original sources. Surprisingly, more often than not they provide them (which is better than a lot of mainstream media articles).</p>
