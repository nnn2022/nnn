    <strong>"For the greater good"</strong>
    <p><p>There are far too many people around here telling us that we need to undergo a medical procedure we do not consent to in order to benefit "the greater good". </p>
<p>Let's extend that argument a little. There are many people out there who are relying on the goodness of others to survive via blood donation, bone marrow donation, organ donation...</p>
<p>For most people, donating blood has no long-term side effects, very little risk, and is a quick and easy procedure. Does this mean that we should <em>force</em> everyone to donate blood regularly? It would benefit the greater good! Yes, there are some people out there who cannot donate blood (eg people who have medical history of low blood pressure), but the vast majority of people are perfectly safe to donate blood. Therefore we should force them to do it regardless of their personal feelings on the matter.</p>
<p>Similarly, bone marrow donation...sure it's a whole surgical procedure but you're not gonna die from it and the person you're donating to will die if they don't get it, so we're gonna force you to do it.</p>
<p>Similarly, organ donation - sure, let's lop off a bit of your liver to help someone else, you can grow it back. Sure, let's take one of your kidneys for someone who needs it more, you've got 2 so you'll be fine. </p>
<p>It is unconscionable to force someone to undergo a medical procedure they don't want. There is <em>always</em> some amount of risk with a medical procedure. Donating blood is considered pretty safe...but suppose you got a bit dehydrated, fainted a few hours later and smacked your head on the fall, doing significant damage. It doesn't matter how safe it is or how much benefit it might do somebody else, you cannot force people to have medical procedures they don't want. </p>
<p>If you feel so strongly that we must act "for the greater good"...if you feel we must take whatever measures necessary to create the smallest benefit for somebody else...if you believe in mandatory vaccination...</p>
<p>Then I'd like to see you donate blood as frequently as you can, actively search out opportunities to donate bone marrow and organs, and give up as much of your healthy, functional body as you can in order to help someone else. Lead the way and show us what "for the greater good" means. </p>
<p>Have told anyone that they must get vaccinated? What would you say if they told you to make one of the aforementioned body part donations for them? </p>
<p>My body my choice. No exceptions.</p></p>

        <p>Good post.</p>
<p>These covid fanatics aren't going to donate any blood, much less a kidney.  You're talking about virtue signalers who literally step over homeless people on the sidewalk every single day on their way to Starbucks.</p>
