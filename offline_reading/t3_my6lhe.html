    <strong>The Real Truth of Who You Are</strong>
    <p><p>We are living in a matrix. A complete illusion of what you "think" is real vs "what is." You have been conditioned from the moment you have been born by your parents, society, role models, education, health, science and etc. We live in a world (western) that is essentially governed by institutions that keep you controlled.</p>
<p>You go to school, get indoctrinated, taught that the only way to get ahead is to follow these set of rules, and if you obey them you will lead a happy life. Make money, pay your taxes, have a few babies, retire at a set age and die. This is the illusion of thinking you're free when you're not. It's done by design to keep you in an invisible cage.</p>
<p>But then you wake up. You have a moment of clarity that things aren't what they are. Perhaps you have an experience such as myself - near death experience, brain cancer at 26 - and are thrusted into the present moment. Where the illusion disappears and you see what matters. You begin to connect with a part of yourself that's much larger than your physical form. An aspect of you that is known as your "higher self." The unseen force that gently nudges you and at times can smacks you across the face to wake up.</p>
<p>This is what happened to me at 26. I almost died (brain cancer) and realized the divine truth of who we are. We are spiritual beings having a human experience. The intent is to grow as the soul from the collective experiences we call life. To learn certain lessons and to evolve as spirit.</p>
<p>What's happening on earth now is a total shift in consciousness. And the human spirit is rising. That's why everything outside is collapsing. The control mechanisms - media, government, science, education, police, and etc are all crumbling. If we're truly going to rise above we need to acknowledge that we've been under control, manipulated, and deceived. And perhaps the most important thing here is to forgive. To forgive those who have wronged us and to forgive ourselves. </p>
<p>If we are truly going to move forward as a species it's not going to happen if we keep victimizing, blaming, shaming, and killing one another. We need to love, have compassion, and have forgiveness. This is the way of the spiritual warrior.</p>
<p>Stand strong my fellow brothers and sisters. We got this. It's already been done. Love and light always prevails.</p></p>

        <p>You have a more positive outlook on where the world is going. I saw "outside the matrix" young too, with severe rare diseases and was given 18 months to live before. I don't see a great awakening but a great asleeping. LOL People who see through it all are being deemed "enemies" already or labeled "crazy". I was a conspiracy theorist/bible prophecy person when I was a fundamentalist Christian [deconverted but still have spiritual beliefs] the world is going into a dark time that is going to make WWII look like nothing. I am glad I am older and not young. I do think we need to have love and compassion, that part I agree with but the world is growing more cold and dark by far.</p>

        <p>You are here on Earth at this precise time because you have a mission, even if you are not yet aware of it. This times are hard for everyone, but you need to stand strong and be mentally ready for whatever the future will bring (I also expect more darkness to come in the next years), letting go of fear is the way.</p>

        <p>Understand, I feel for any people who are young today. Consider most remote self sustaining life you can get, I know they have put up economic cages for everyone just about. We are in our 50s, husband late 50s. Scares me I have to live in such a snake pit being this disabled.</p>

        <p>Very very well said, but it is incredibly difficult for people to make such drastic changes. Most of us know no other way of life, so it’s going to be an uphill battle. I do believe we are experiencing a great awakening though. It’s usually the most chaotic and painful process, but the other side is where true freedom lies. Stay strong and we will get to the other side in time. 😊</p>

        <p>The elite and lucifarian cultists are controlling everything. Mocking god/Jesus and the rest of us. </p>
<p>The only way out if this is to pray. Pray for yourself. Pray for your loved ones. Pray for those that are trying to enslave us. </p>
<p>Until this pandemic I would call myself an atheist. I would look to science for all the answers. Appealing to these institutions is dangerous. They are there to control and manipulate. Feeding truth mixed in with lies. We are in the Matrix. A matrix where we are unable to tell fact from fiction. </p>
<p>They pull their shills in on both sides so that every narrative other than the one they want us to believe seems crazy. </p>
<p>Wanna see the truth? Look at the things they are attempting to silence.</p>
<p>Things aren't crumbling because the spirit is assending. Things are crumbling because these lucifarian cultists wish it. They are in charge. But Jesus is coming to wipe the floor with them. They are scared of that day - and they should be. </p>
<p>Glory to God! He will triumph over all evil!</p>

<p>I didn’t have a near death experience like you, but I thought I was going to die alone in a state far from home that I moved to for work last year. My friend dropped everything to save my life and help me get out of there. If he hadn’t I don’t know if I would be alive.</p>

        <p>I did it all. Kept up with the Jones’s, bought a house, new car, had kids and now at age 54 I see it was a rat race for nothing. For material possessions and being in debt for nothing.  </p>
<p>Now that the kids have gone my husband and I realized we grew apart and I blame being distracted and driven by all of that garbage instead of taking that time to continue to know him. Now I’m divorced and seeing someone who is as carefree as I am. My ex  bought a house and a new car and continues his pursuit of happiness. </p>

        <p>Agreed. All of this is much in line with the Biblical Book of Revelations. A 2000 year old scroll accurately predicting a dystopian future for the entire planet that has never been possible before in history and is unfolding before our very eyes. </p>
<p>The great awakening will come, but before it come the tribulations. Not all will awaken.</p>

        <p>Yes! Well written. People are waking up at an astronomical rate although it may appear "slow" it's happening faster &amp; faster! It happened to me right after 12/21/12 and now I'm seeing it happen to SO many people. They come looking for help understanding what is happening to them.</p>
