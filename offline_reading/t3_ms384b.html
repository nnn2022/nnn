    <strong>They are going to ramp up tyranny so we have a duty to resist</strong>
    <p><p>They have everything planned with even microchips coming real now which were once things we were laughed at when we talked about. They have their disgusting tentacles in everything. Great people have resisted the elites previously and we must do so too. </p>
<p>Microchips, vaccines which sterilize you, drag queen perverts in schools, Biden’s gun laws, a stolen election, the destruction of the United States economy. They are trying to instill communism. We must resist them before we are put in camps with guillotines to kill those of us who didn’t take the vaccine.</p></p>
