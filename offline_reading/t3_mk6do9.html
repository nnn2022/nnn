    <strong>I'm getting the vaccine. The pandemic is over for me personally.</strong>
    <p><p>I support what you guys are doing. These restrictions are insane. Governments all over the world are going crazy restricting basic, basic, freedoms. </p>
<p>But the vaccines are here now and I'm gonna get them. Initially I was skeptical, but reading up on the science I feel comfortable with it. I understand what they're doing and I fully support them. I think these new technologies are the future of vaccines and viral diseases.</p>
<p>After the vaccine, I can go about daily life without being scared. And I really am scared of coronavirus, for instance, when I get back to my building I wash my hands before I eat. I haven't gone to any club or party with 100s of people. I realize that it's not "just a flu". It's more severe, unpredictable, and of course killing people. So if you are concerned, you are NORMAL. Sometimes ppl in this sub will think you're crazy for being worried. And I just wanna say USE YOUR OWN HEAD. I don't have to trust the media narrative, but I don't have to blindly accept you guys either. </p>
<p>I'm done following any covid protocol after getting vaccinated. I'm going everywhere maskless even if your business requires one, unless I get explicitly told to leave. And if someone asks, I'm just gonna tell em that I'm vaccinated. Fuck the whole, "ohh you still have to do what we tell you after getting vaccinated". Nope, not gonna listen. At some point I have to evaluate my own personal freedom and liberty.</p>
<p>I think masks and lockdown don't work, but I do believe that we're in a pandemic, and you should exercise good precaution based on your risk factors. What I don't like is some bastard dog barking orders at me over the PA system, in an Orwelian voice, "PUT YOUR FACE COVERINGS UP AND MAINTAIN SIX FEET DISTANCE AT ALL TIMES" over and over.</p></p>

<p>I would just like to point out that complying with what you are told to do in order to "get your freedom back" with the only insurance of a promise from politicians that make empty promises for a living isn't exactly the best move if you value your freedom.</p>

        <p>But it won't be over for anyone.  They haven't even gotten together and coordinated their lies about whether people who have vaccinated can go about life as before Covid.</p>
<p>It's about control and they are not giving that up- and they'll parade out variant after variant to maintain it if they have to.</p>

        <p>So far the vaccines work against variants and I'm fine with taking booster shots as new variants increase down the years.</p>
<p>Honestly variants are not a concern. The vaccine can be developed against any new variant in a matter of months. That's how this mrna tech works it's super fast.</p>

        <p>They aren't as effective as you might think. The ones from Pfizer and Moderna are ... AstraZeneca is shit...  You don't know what are the long term secondary effects, they produced it in one year.... Doesn't that ring a bell? Who guarantees your health when you cannot sue them? Who says you will not develop auto-immune diseases? It is your choice as it is mine not to take it....  I had covid, lasted 2 days... a headache and that was it.

        <p>Well, the fact that 100 million ppl in the US already have been vaccinated is some reassurance in my decision that I'm not the only one. The side effects are being recorded and to my evaluation, the fatal ones are super rare. </p>
<p>These vaccines were actually ready in months. The year it took was because of the trials. It's the nature of this vaccine tech; it's super fast. And that's why Im not worried about variants. You just swap out the RNA genetic payload in the vaccine platform, and you're good to go for new variants.</p>
<p>Yeah...I know they're back to fear mongering again. Historically governments are reluctant to give back freedoms once they've taken them. We're gonna have to fight this. For instance, look at 9/11. You still have to strip for the bastard pigs at airport security. You fucking can't even take a water bottle with you. But once you cross security you can buy all the bottled water in the world?? Wtf??</p>

        <p>I am talking about the LONG term secondary effects. The fact that 100 million people took it, doesn't mean anything. Let's talk in one-two years. I might be wrong, but right now I am going to be skeptical. I just read that in Japan there is a new variant that is vaccine-proof, like wtf? My father is 72 - diabetic and went through the disease. He is fine and healthy. If you know how to treat yourself, then you will have no problems. I agree with the rest.</p>

<p>Except that won't be up to you if your local supermarket still requires masks and social distancing in spite of being vaccinated. </p>
<p>It also won't be up to you if your state governor issues a mask mandate, social distancing and another vaccine for a new variant. </p>
<p>&rt; The vaccines are very much effective. 95% against illness and 100% against death and severe illness.</p>
<p>Only until the government's "experts" move the goalposts again, and require you to continue doing what ever they say in order to enjoy what ever amount of freedom they're willing to return to you.</p>

        <p>Well I'm not as scared as I was tbh. But at the back of my mind it's the fact that there is a disease out there killing millions, and leaving tens of millions in a horrible state. It truly is the first modern pandemic.</p>
<p>Even if I do get covid, it will probably not be the worst medical issue that Ive been through, cause I've been through a lot. </p>
<p>Also, I think that being vaccinated is a good choice to limit the spread of this virus. We can separate the medical science, and the politics.</p>

        <p>You talk about reading up on the vaccine tech, are you aware that mRNA technology was abandoned by most Pharma companies because of the serious side effects? They couldn’t get it to work in over 30 years, but somehow got it right this time in less than 6 months. Did you ever read the Wikipedia on mRNA vaccines?</p>

        <p>So you believe that they solved the inherent issues with mRNA side effects in 6 months? I don’t. You sound just like the propaganda I hear everywhere about how safe the vaccines are. I hope it works without the usual serious side effects down the road. It’s your gamble to take, I really don’t want to say “I told you so!” in a few years.</p>

        <p>Yea look, I find your fear to be not proportionate to the disease. But as a germaphobe, I'm always for sanitization :D I'm as afraid of Covid as I am of a common cold, which is not at all, I just like things clean. And my hands. And I don't like masks. I know how 90% of people are using them and it can lead to a serious respiratory infection. Which may be blamed on Covid in the future.</p>

<p>Some of it is the early shock from back in March april last year before we knew what this really is. </p>
<p>Rn I'm not as scared as I was. I know that it's not gonna kill me. But we do know that a somewhat significant portion of covid patients develop long term chronic issues. Chronic illness scares the fuck outta me as I have a few chronic illnesses my self. That sh*t can be on your mind 24/7 if you have a chronic condition.</p>

<p>If you are at risk, by all means do what will ease your mind and what will protect you. However, whoever is sensitive should have known to watch themselves properly even before Covid. You know very well you are responsible for your health. Habits should not change. I will always advocate personal hygiene.</p>

        <p>I have never really had a problem with this specific vaccine. I just dont believe it is going to kill us all, although I do think people are signing up to be human test subjects.</p>
<p>But by consenting to all this BS you are basically saying yes to a bio-surveillance system that will turn into a social credit system very shortly.</p>
<p>In my opinion, <em>that</em> is the reason for all of this.  The virus is hyped so that everyone thinks that the nastiness will only end via vaccine. And then a vaccine-monitoring system can be built up around us without any resistance. Plus .. wars are always good for business, and this is going to be an eternal war against an invisible enemy that can never be beaten.</p>
<p>You are basically consenting to a whole new world of vaccine and virus concerns.  A new normal of scanning and checks and "green" and "red".  Where you want to do something and the first thing that people need to do is check their vaccination status.</p>
<p>It will become a ubiquitous part of our lives.</p>
<p>I reject that new normal existence over a virus that is essentially a "triple flu".</p>

        <p>Yeah some of what is said here I really resonate with. But, other things I find it hard to agree with. Open discussion is always good. This whole situation is so unprecedented I doubt anyone knows the whole truth.</p>

        <p>The whole truth is that germ theory is a lie. Please read more about it.  Contagion is a myth. The house of cards falls when everyone realizes that there is no such thing as a pathogenic virus. One has never been isolated or purified, EVER!</p>
<p>The virus myth was used to save the germ theory because the germ theory turned out to be a false  </p>
<p>The virus myth is an excellent business model for BIG PHARMA to sell their snake oil (vaccines, pharmaceuticals, etc.)  </p>
<p>What people ignorantly call “viruses” are literally your own genetic particles that have a 16-stage pleomorphic cycle that respond to your body being poisoned and being mineral deficient. They’re not the cause of illnesses.  </p>
<p>Any symptom you experience is the body’s response to being poisoned. Your body is a self-healing organism and it will do anything necessary to get rid of toxins. It’s that simple  </p>
<p>These genetic particles have never been proven to be contagious. People only believe in this nonsense because of constant indoctrination and fear.  </p>
<p>Germ theory and virus myth is all based on contagion. Contagion is a scientific religious belief system that promotes this false threat of microorganisms. It was used to create a “boogeyman” out of your own body. It’s all based on superstition, blind faith, etc.  </p>
<p>Contagion was created out of straight ignorance and unawareness, nothing more.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately this belief system has been used by very powerful &amp; wealthy people in esoteric groups to gain more social &amp; financial control over people. And unfortunately it has worked for centuries, especially within the last 150 years.  </p>
<p>please reconsider  the poisoning of  your  brilliant and beautiful body.</p>
