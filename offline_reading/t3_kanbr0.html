    <strong>"I hope society won't be dystopian", I said in 2016.</strong>
    <p><p>(This was first posted in r-Coronacirklejerk, but was removed for being offensive and was meant as a "reply" to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/k64tvm/a_delicious_recipe_from_the_1979_irans_islamic/">another post</a>. I don't understand how this is offensive, but the two memes I made aren't - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCirclejerk/comments/jkj5z5/western_world_on_face_covering_before_and_after/">HERE</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCirclejerk/comments/jxylak/western_world_on_face_covering_before_and_after/">HERE</a>.)</p>
<p>In 2016 when I was 16 years old, I once had a conversation with a friend of mine. I was known for having opinions seen as political incorrect and controversial ones about a lot. In that conversation I said I was skeptical about new residents bringing new culture to my country and I was concerned if someone wanted it to become laws like forced facial covering, strict rules on what's allowed/not allowed and not allowing fun things (E.g. food types, some parties type and relationship types). </p>
<p>I wasn't against people moving to my country or them living their lifestyles - as long it's an individual choice. I was just skeptical to some of their culture, values and belief system becoming laws and everyone else having to follow it. I wanted freedom, democracy, gender equality and similar, like a modern teen. I said "I hope society won't be dystopian. This ain't looking good". My friend then replied "It won't be happening. Most people won't support it. Only a few would. I won't support it either". <strong>Now I'm not against people choosing what they wants to believe in and their lifestyle choices, but I'm against making certain customs to laws - to clarify.</strong></p>
<p>Now in 2020, it did happen. The dystopian did happen. It came from the government. Most people who brought with them new culture from different places never told us to cover our face, to stay at home, what to think, which entertainment were "permissible" and "not permissible". Yes, Some were conservative, but most were pro-choice and accepted other living modern lifestyle. Many of them were fine not everyone following their belief system. It's the government, the previously pro-freedom people (E.g. feminists) and my social circle - who in 2016 said they would never support authoritarianism - that supported the lockdown and the restrictions. Yes, there is a disease here. Yes, it has a science feel to it. No, it's not an old belief or ancient books. But the virus has 99,9% survival chance. So, the restrictions and lockdown aren't justifiable. Not only are it affecting the economy and education, but also mental health, human's/civil rights and freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Funnily enough, the people who preached for freedom, mental health and live life to your fullest, are now in 2020 screaming "lockdown harder and cover your face!"</strong></p></p>

        <p>I knew the world would become increasingly technofascist and dystopian in my lifetime as well, but I totally thought it would mainly be around combating “climate change” or the response to another 9/11 (not that both are still not possibilities as well, especially the ramped up climate alarmism). I didn’t think they would use a scamdemic and happen so fast, and the way they've used it for almost a total power grab makes it seem like it nothing could have been better for the elite class. War is the health of the state became health is the health of the state real damn quick.</p>

        <p>I thought things could go wrong again since humanity's mistakes are constantly repeating itself, something you can see when opening a history book or reading old newspapers. But I didn't believe this would happen or that my country would be affected very soon.</p>
<p>I thought an overreaction to climate change and a pro-green lifestyle would be happening internationally. I also guessed some wars, terrorism etc. would continue existing in some countries. But I never expected a dystopian virus fearing society or an apocalypse like mood. Maybe it's because of most of the earlier epidemics and pandemics didn't affect the whole world very much. It only affected some countries. I'm fully aware of "the black death" and "the Spanish flu" affected big part of the world. I can't remember reading about a full lockdown over "the Spanish flu" though.</p>

        <p>Well that was quite a revelation in your OP. When I started living on my own back in 1980's, I was already afraid some big revolution was going to happen and much worse in some parts of my country than in others. My job was teaching high school, where I first encountered the idea of LOCKSTEP and one size fits all education no matter how much they talked about unique learning styles, bleh bleh bleh. And I saw a lot in the media to scare me about Sharia law. I taught the novel, Brave New World for many years straight, and every year more students would recognize things coming true. But just like you, I could not have guessed such global doom over such an obvious scam by so many. Never could have guessed this would turn out in my lifetime. Thank you so much for sharing.</p>
