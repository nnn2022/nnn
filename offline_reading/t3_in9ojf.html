    <strong>Lockdowns have put my baby making plans on hold.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in California. Lockdowns have been harsh. I’m only 20 but my husband and I have been thinking about having a baby. We were trying for a little bit but I got back on birth control after I got injured and had surgery. </p>
<p>After I heal, I don’t know if we’re going to try again. Things are scary right now. I’m not scared of covid, I’m scared of the government. I don’t want my kid to grow up in a world where the government controls when you can go outside. We’re probably leaving soon, his job is really in demand in rural areas but we live in a suburb right now. Even then I don’t know if we’re going to keep trying. There might be nationwide lockdowns if a certain candidate wins, and the problems with China are just getting worse. I can see the third world war happening in my lifetime with China. I don’t want my kid to live in that.</p>
<p>I’m really upset over this. I have my chance to be a young mom like I’ve always wanted, my husband is 27 soon and has a great job. I have a good job and decent savings. I have my chance to do what I’ve always wanted and the fucking government is ruining it. I want to die.</p></p>

        <p>This happened to me, too. We were going to start a family this fall. It’s devastating to put it on hold. I’m much older than you, though. I grew up poor and it was important to me to get to a place of financial stability before having kids. I worked and worked and worked, and finally got there. Then covid and the lockdowns happened. Now I can’t bear to bring a new life into this scary, dark shithole.</p>
<p>Doesn’t help that when I share this sad news with friends and family they are like “oh yeah, you should wait because IT’S SO DANGEROUS RIGHT NOW.” Omg dude that’s not what I meant. It’s not covid. Could you be <em>more</em> asleep at the wheel?!</p>
<p>Anyway. You have so much time. And so much can change so quickly. No harm in waiting and re-evaluating. I also absolutely encourage you to move if you’re in a suburb of a big CA city. It sounds like a terrible place to raise a family anyway and is very dystopian there.</p>

        <p>Also, I too am nervous AF about China. I’d prefer a war (that’s saying a lot considering I’m a pacifist) to them just infiltrating our media and social media and values, subversively. Destabilizing our governments and political systems, and then just creeping on in. That’s what I fear is happening. I’m extremely unnerved. It all feels like fiction, including the fact that no one seems to be paying attention.</p>

        <p>It is all fiction - in fact it's like the Matrix. Very little of what is reported as news is real in any sense; the vast majority is mind-warping propaganda that bears zero relation to reality. I wouldn't be so concerned about China though, it's not them who is infiltrating the media. China is owned by Western elites and has been since at least Mao (really it's much, much earlier but I don't have enough hard evidence to make a compelling case). Mao was funded by Jewish bankers and his troops were trained by OSS, the precursor to the CIA. Mao rapidly industrialized the country and forced people into cities where they could be more easily controlled and used for labor. Under Nixon Kissinger began moving US manufacturing to China, leading to US dependance on Chinese exports. A large majority of US pharmaceuticals come from China now. Today, Xi Jinping is controlled by Robert Lawrence Kuhn of the Kuhn bankster family. The East-West paradigm is flawed, since the ruling elite attained full worldwide control in the aftermath of WWII. The only relevant question nowadays is which trillionaire families own which countries. It's true that the West is collapsing, but it's not China that's causing it - it's the cosmopolitan elites migrating to a new power center with a new (fully technocratic) management regime.  They are destabilizing their own counties on purpose to facilitate the transition, selling division and fear in the media and pretending that Russia or China is behind it. They think they can get away with it, and so far they have, but I think they just cannot stop themselves. As parasites they used to be in some kind of equilibrium with their host, but with the advent of modern technology they are running amok because they never learned to rein themselves in from their bloodsucking. If you want any sources for the claims I have made just ask.</p>

        <p>Excellent post. I have a few comments.</p>
<p>China may not be causing it, but they are buying up a lot of companies in Canada. They may not be in charge, but I do feel like North America is being set up for a takeover. </p>
<p>Is the Kuhn family not one of the 13 families who own the Fed? Isn't it really just the same bankers behind both sides, kind of like WW2?</p>

        <p>I'm Canadian, and I agree China is making significant inroads in Canada, from real estate, to business, to immigration. I just want to point out that while at the level of individual Chinese people, they are just following the incentives in front of them, at the highest level those incentives are manipulated by the elite to achieve the power transition I described. </p>
<p>Yes, Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., along with J.P. Morgan, set up the Jekyll Island conference where the Federal Reserve was conceived. It is exactly like the bankers funding both (all) sides to control them.</p>

        <p>I agree with spongedrunk. I am 34 and my partner and I want to have a baby soon also. For several years I had bought into the MSM fear mongering and had decided I would not have my own family because of all the doom upon us. I even did a session with a group of female therapists about grief over climate change taking away our desire for motherhood. But then I realised that I am grateful for the life I've lived, and that even when I had a near death experience at 18 I was grateful for that too. Living is a risk, and it's one worth taking! If you and your husband know you can give a loving experience to an incarnating soul by all means bring a beautiful child into this world.</p>
<p>We need free thinkers now more than and ever, and conscious parents raising conscious children!</p>

        <p>Ignore those people.  I don't know anyone who regrets having kids young, in a stable situation like yours. But regretful older women with fertility problems are a dime a dozen.   Waiting til 30 to have kids is a very silly cultural value with no justification.</p>

        <p>You’re young by most middle class standards. My in laws married at 21 and first kid was at 22. That was in the 50’s and all their friends were doing the same. I’ve known coworkers who had kids in their 20’s. By their 40’s, they are close to being empty nesters with many years of vitality ahead of them. Makes a lot of sense.</p>

        <p>I feel you 100% I'm the same age as your husband. I am too scared to bring a life into this world in the state it is in. I don't want to bring a new life into the world that could be a full blown dystopia. It sucks.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm your husbands age not yours</p>

        <p>I think you should have the kid. There will always be problems in the world, there is no right time. If there is going to be a world war then it will happen regardless. Time and tide wait for no man. (Or woman)</p>

        <p>My fiancee and I were in the same boat but we've ultimately decided to go through with having a baby. The elite want this. They want depopulation--whether it be through crashing the economy, forced vaccinations, or people scared from the uncertainty. This is the whole point of this damn situation being forced on us. Don't let them win. Don't let them have their way.</p>

        <p>I feel guilty having a child who will be old enough to remember the Old Normal, in the New Normal (because I 100% believe this is permanent).</p>
<p>I wouldn't have kids. Absolutely not. It's tragic but in this sort of dystopian hellscape? Unless things get better - nope.</p>
