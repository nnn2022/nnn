    <strong>Did anyone lose their innocence this last year and become a new person?</strong>
    <p><p>Since March 2020, I feel like I became a new person. I feel like I was naive and innocent prior to then, and now I am awakened. </p>
<p>I now know that many people around me would do and have done things like:</p>
<p>&rt; Call the cops on a friend or neighbor for having guests over</p>
<p>&rt; Yell at, shame, and scold their neighbor for jogging outside without a mask on</p>
<p>&rt; call the cops on a business for not enforcing masks</p>
<p>&rt; post a picture of an undocumented landscaper online because he wasn’t wearing a mask while doing yard work outside and alone in an attempt to destroy his life</p>
<p>&rt; cheer when the police arrests a bunch of kids of color for having a party (whilst complaining that the police is racist)</p>
<p>&rt; advocate for the destruction of businesses and jobs, and offer nothing but “well the government should give more assistance” as their excuse for not caring about other people ending up homeless </p>
<p>&rt; beg for forced v@CCin@tions and humiliation of people who don’t want them. </p>
<p>That’s just a small handful of things. </p>
<p>I’ve absolutely lost trust in a large number of people. </p>
<p>Both sides of my family fled tyrannical and oppressive regimes outside the USA. I used to wonder how that shit happened. Now I understand. People went along with it. People  not only allowed it to happen, but wanted it to happen.</p></p>

        <p>I stand in awe at these people who have been reprogrammed by all the media shit for the last year, like "did you volunteer for the mindfucking of did they pay you?" And then I think about the stay home handouts that have gone on all year long.. yep, they paid people for the courtesy of brainwashing them.</p>

        <p>Ive had some personal shit around that time so i think that had more to do with it, but aside from that this whole situation made me loose faith in the medical system. From now on, with any symptoms i first do my research myself, then i look at potential treatments, chemicals, side effects, etc. I simply dont take their word point blank anymore. Same goes with vets (google lepro l4 jab, for example if you have a dog).</p>
<p>To me maintaining health from now on will be: good lifestyle, a lot of sleep, good food, little to none of their chemicals, exercise, and little stress. The rest i leave to chance. Thankfully for me its been years since i last needed a medical intervention. </p>
<p>Ive also lost trust in a lot of left leaning fellow citizens whove directly wished death upon me just for disagreeing with them. Sometimes these were strangers, but sometimes these were people i used to go to school or work with. Im disappointing to see such a thing dividing us, but i dont want to deal with their blatant lack of respect and consideration for people with different opinions to their own. Im also real, so i refuse to pretend otherwise. If im wrong thats fine, but i stick to my own. Only with facts i will change my mind. I dont deal with demagogues. </p>
<p>I dont even consider myself "far right" but i think our youth is concerningly far left. They all want that horrible oppressive shit otherwise known as socialism.  Its just shit, man. People in general are far less trusting, ive had a few friends with very good positions tell me they dont want to discuss these things online anymore, only offline for fear of being "found out". We're talking about high ranking people. To me that was a really concerning sign of how we lost our free speech.</p>

        <p>One time I needed a doctor of the right kind to figure out what was wrong with me. I didn't know why I lost my voice for a month and had throat issues. It was based in stomach acid affecting my throat.</p>
<p>Anyway, have you noticed how big pharma will define a health problem in a way that serves their drug selling agenda. For example heartburn is too much stomach acid. Therefore you need their drugs to lower your stomach acid. I realized the stomach is supposed to be acidic." The real problem is stomach acid getting where it doesn't belong. The chemicals in the water are contributing to that. I believe it's the chlorine, because I've been around multiple types of tap water. Drinking even "filtered" water makes my stomach acid problems worse. </p>
<p>Your heart problems are from too much cholesterol or too much bad and not enough good cholesterol. Therefore, you need our cholesterol altering drugs. </p>
<p>At this point I don't believe in full democracy anymore. Maybe some limited form with various qualified people. That still might not work, because you've got to consider what the evil overlords can corrupt.</p>
<p>As far as socialism, we're not supposed to have the government taking care of us. We're supposed to have the government leaving us alone, so we can take care of ourselves. Although, I would be interested in government programs to encourage intelligent, productive, law-abiding people to breed more. Right now the government is paying the worst people to have children.</p>

        <p>Too true! My bfs doctor was shocked when he lowered his cholesterol by eating better and exercising more instead of using the prescription he gave him. The doctor didn’t even tell him that was a possibility, luckily he does his own research too! This past year has really made me lose my faith in doctors. Any one who would advise me to get the vax, I wouldn’t trust.</p>

        <p>I read a book once where an anti-big-pharma doctor was saying what really matters with cholesterol is the difference between HDL and LDL. The LDL patches things up and HDL removes stuff. You want some of both. Too much LDL and there's too much patching and blockages occur. Something like that. You might have a lot of both and a good balance going, though. There are people with high cholesterol that are not having heart problems and people with low cholesterol that are having heart issues. It's not even as certain as they try to make it out to be.</p>
<p>As far as general and long-term health, doctors are often in a situation where people who don't care about their health are going to them and paying them to care about their health for them. It doesn't work like that. The doctors often tell people to eat right and exercise, and their patients don't do it. Also, "eat right" and "eat healthy" are open to a lot of interpretations. I actually heard someone say a sugar-laden, white flour muffin was "healthy" recently.  Seems like most people have no idea what actual healthy eating is.</p>

        <p>Oh I’m sure this doctor was definitely used to just medicating people who don’t want to be responsible for their own health. It was a cheap, public clinic, so I’m sure a lot of their patients have no idea how to eat right. My bf is from London and he’s often talked about how our health system is so much more focused on overmedication as opposed to preventative or therapeutic care. He grew up with ADHD, and never even heard of adderall or riddlein until he came here, he just learned to deal with it. I still wouldn’t put our government in charge of healthcare though! Lol</p>

        <p>I had GERD for years.  They wanted to operate.  What it may turn out that you need is more stomach acid, not less.  (It helps the valve stay shut.)  Apple cider vinegar works great.  Also, you need to correct whatever nutritional problem is leading to the low stomach acid.</p>
<p>The more heartburn you have, the more you're going to have it.  You need to let the injury heal.</p>

        <p>It seemed like drinking ACV would make it go away. </p>
<p>I think tap water exposure is causing the stomach problem. I could probably use a shower filter, but I'm not sure if it'll be a good enough filter. I try to avoid drinking it as much as I can.</p>

        <p>For me that was a long time ago, being a VERY infrequent visitor to clinics or doctors in general. They always seemed to be in a hurry, I used to tell people "This doctor doesn't even care about my symptoms or distress - he has one hand holding his clipboard, the other is on the door handle to leave the room - doesn't give an air of concern or interest at all'.</p>
<p>And even then? <br>
All they ever did was give a pill anyway, which may or may not have worked.</p>

        <p>Thank you for mentioning the Lepro 14 jab, I feel terrible I just got my pocket pittie his annual vaccines and looked to see this was given. I also have a rescue Bernese that I haven’t taken to the Vet in over a year because they always gave me antibiotics and steroids for easily home remedied skin issues. I wish I could find a homeopathic Vet that cares about the animals and not making bank. I lost faith in doctors when my son’s allergist prescribed Montelukast and this happy, athletic, funny kid was asking about the meaning of life and what is the point of living. He would cry daily, I thought it was puberty but researched this drug and found out other children had same reaction. FDA has https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-requires-boxed-warning-about-serious-mental-health-side-effects-asthma-and-allergy-drug I stopped the pill and he went back to his normal self. Who would have thought a pill for allergies could cause suicidal thoughts?</p>

        <p>From what I understand SSRI’s inhibit general fear. </p>
<p>Fear of a dreadful future, fear of crowds, fear of rejection. Fear of consequence. When it inhibits fears it can have a positive effect. It can remove or lessen the symptoms of depression, anxiety etc. It can also lessen the fear of spiders and thus cure arachnophobia while active too.</p>
<p>The problem is that it would also remove the fear of giant spiders trying to eat you. </p>
<p>Another negative effect would be removing the fear of consequences of harming yourself of your environment. The SSRI’s can thus be very dangerous for ppl with intentions to harm ppl. In self hating ppl it can and will increase self harm and suicide. In ppl hating other ppl it can and will increase abuse and murder.</p>
<p>It’s a very dangerous drug to prescribe to cause of their developed trauma is still daily present.</p>

        <p>My theory is that the govt. unleashed the most powerful propaganda force ever known to man at some point around this time last year.  It was just about the time I would have expected them to have fully processed how it was used in 2016 by other governments etc and develop and perfect their own social media manipulation psychological operations division.  </p>
<p>They admit to this forces existence but said it wasn't to be used domestically and I'm sure we can trust them on their word, just like they told the Tuskegee subjects they were trying to help them.</p>

        <p>I honestly believe that all of COVID—both the “release” and the media reaction—was manufactured because of the massive amount of data that world governments have on their populations from social media usage. We already know that social media can predict what you will buy and thus advertise those things to you. I think that’s the tip of the iceberg. They knew it would almost perfectly divide society the same way that the past presidential elections did.</p>
<p>And honestly, the more data they collect, the more easily they will be able to shape public opinion by manufacturing more events that are designed to push our buttons.</p>

        <p>I'm from Missouri, the "show me" state. I'm also an only child and grew up with two parents and one set of grandparents in the same household. Most of my friends were older than me and I spent most of my time around adults. I came home one day from elementary school, I don't remember what age but pretty young, and I said "Mom I figured out what happens to all these dumb kids. They grow up to be dumb parents." I said that after witnessing some really irrational overly harsh and stupid pronouncements by my friend's parents. My mom repeated this story to me for the rest of her life on occasion when it became relevant. I think it's relevant now.</p>

        <p>I remember in my freshman year of college during some kind of group project, a classmate was laughing and  recounting a time when he broke the family TV by accident and his dad <em>punched him in the face.</em></p>
<p>At the time, I was shocked, but also young and dumb so I kept quiet. Another classmate said that his dad sounded insane. The guy was also in a fraternity and told a story about how he once got so drunk during a party that he blacked out and woke up alone somewhere unknown. Again, I was young and dumb so I kept quiet, but as an older adult now, I cringe because so much bad shit could have happened to that guy. </p>
<p>I remember a time when my mom told me that some parents only care about <em>things</em> but not their kids’ behaviors. This guy’s dad taught him that it’s wrong to break the TV. But he didn’t teach his kid not to let himself get drunk around a bunch of stupid frat brothers who will abandon him in a strange place.</p>

        <p>My parents didn't teach us to drink or do drugs. They were not into that stuff, but my oldest brother got into it. My mom was unstable, though, and would be yelling and screaming like a crazy person. So I think that messed up any parental relationships we'd have. It also made my dad look bad for tolerating all of this and doing nothing about it. My oldest brother was always out looking for bad stuff to do.</p>

        <p>Especially in March, people were scared out of their minds. Even now, some of the doomer people I know are people that I considered very nice prior to all this. As someone else said, it just reflects how deeply fear mongering panic can penetrate otherwise rational and kind people.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. A part of me is angry and frustrated that others can't see through the lies... but I was also fooled for so long and still doubt myself sometimes. </p>
<p>In a way, I'm glad that I only felt ignorant fear in March 2020. I can't imagine the emotions if I knew what I know now.</p>

        <p>i think there's little shame in falling victim to the most powerful propaganda machine, combined with fear.</p>
<p>i was in panic once because i developed a head cold after grocery shopping and thought i could have passed covid on to some vulnerable relatives (bumped into a cousin at the store, some of her family was vulnerable).</p>
<p>honestly I'm not sure i can really blame most people. i think a lot of them are still locked in that fear. having been there and snapped out of it, i know how strong it is </p>
<p>and even the hypocrites are mostly brainwashed by the propaganda.</p>
<p>it's horrific.</p>

<p>i know when i was terrified, i couldn't even consider that stuff. the fear was really all-consuming, a constant low-level buzz. </p>
<p>i literally snapped out of it around November, when I saw the actual death rates. Just this sudden realization that "oh, this is about as fatal as the flu. we don't do this for the flu. I've spent my whole life risking death by the flu. what am i even worried about?" </p>
<p>so i try to understand where people might be coming from if they're stuck in that fear stage.</p>
<p>but what I don't understand is why other people haven't had similar realizations by now. maybe it's naïve to hope they will. maybe I'm being too generous in my assessment of them.</p>

        <p>Well, I can give you a good answer. </p>
<p>For a long time I've had that feeling of 'hmm, this doesn't seem to be that dangerous' but I literally just assumed I was wrong because scientists said so. </p>
<p>It sounds hyperbolic but it was only last week that I thought to myself 'hey, wait a minute... is this bullshit?'.</p>
<p>It took me about 10 minutes to find this subreddit and I almost instantaneously knew that my faint suspicions were correct. It's weird but I legit asked myself 'is this bullshit?' and I felt like I snapped out of a dream.</p>

        <p>what do you mean by actual death rates? Covid is WAY deadlier than the flu, its gotten like 500,000 people while the flu gets like 20k or something. Its death rate is around 1% from what ive heard.</p>
<p>however if youre younger than like 60 the deathrate is comparable to the flu. is that what you're talking about?</p>

        <p>If I was 75 or vulnerable, I would honestly want for the healthy members of society to fully engage while I sheltered so we would reach herd immunity faster and I wouldn’t when to shelter as long.</p>
<p>In March 2020, I had reason to believe I may be vulnerable (I soon realized my “combordity” was irrelevant to covid andI was not at risk) and I was scared to catch covid at the time, and this is what I honestly urged for on the main coronavirus subs.  I was not at all in favor of prolonging the spread, thus prolonging my own house arrest.</p>
<p>I still believe in this tactic and believe it would benefit everyone, including the vulnerable who wouldn’t have to shelter for as long compared to if we chose a “covid strategy”.</p>

        <p>It's not 1%. IFR is <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13554">0.15% overall and 0.05% for those &lt;70 years old</a></p>
<p>In other words, measurably but not insanely more lethal than flu for over 70s, and less lethal than flu for under 70s.</p>
<p>Your numbers would be far different if the world spent 18 months hyper-focusing on the flu, incorrectly using PCR tests to pick up flu cases, and labelling any deaths within 28 days of a positive test result as a flu death. We don't even test for the flu.</p>

        <p>Well, I think we could've had a lot more money or things that are bought with money if they weren't constantly robbing us with taxes for bullshit and even inflation based on money printing or digital money creation based in making loans with only a fraction in reserve. As long as you could have something and not have your daily life interfered with, you could forget about THEM. Now THEY are ramping things up to full crazy.</p>

        <p>I agree they abused the money system and make it more and more impossible to live. Think about our level of technology now, we could have far happier life if a bunch of greedy sociopaths weren't out to ruin it. Yeah we could have lives before. They are interfering directly in our lives and have destroyed our social ties.</p>

        <p>&rt; “Democrats good Republicans bad” </p>
<p>Yesterday I was in the politics subreddit and came upon a discussion about reparations.  The liberals in the discussions stated that they unequivocally believe giving reparations to black people are the right thing to do in moral and social justice grounds, and that we as a nation need to “right our wrongs” and that the reparations payouts would help black people climb out of poverty, access more opportunities, and mitigate the miseries of the poverties they suffer as a result of our nation’s wrongdoing.  Then they said they can’t not adopt it on their platform because it’s a poison pill and they would render their team unelectable in every election where they adopt it in their platform.  They then went around chiding others in the thread who support officially taking on reparations and accused them of being saboteurs and right wing trolls.  Everyone who called for the party to adopt the very policies they claim to value were downvoted to oblivion and buried.</p>
<p>I was aghast.  Regardless of my own stance on reparations, I can’t believe I was witnessing a group of people who took the time to virtue signal about how much they morally cared about a certain issue, only to openly call for dismissing it on the basis of seeking power.  </p>
<p>Democrats are empty vessels of virtue signalers.  It’s not just a meme.  They have no principles.  The only thing they care about is gaining power and control, nothing else.  They will happily betray the values they claim publicly to hold in the pursuit of power. They claim to represent the interests of minorities, but only when it advances their narrative.  Any minority who strays from their narrative, any minority exists outside the designated paradigm they keep us pigeonholed in, is demeaned, discredited, unpersoned, canceled, and labeled as brainwashed, uneducated, race traitors, and only slandered with racist epithet like “Uncle Tom” and “house n<strong>gger”.  My own city’s public school school board literally called Asians “house n</strong>ggers” who “use white supremacy thinking to get ahead” because their narrative fails to explain why our minority group is defying their expectations.  Instead of celebrating a minority group achieving success despite the odds they suggested, instead of revising or updating their narrative when it has been proven wrong or outdated, they chose instead to apply the evil white supremacy label to a minority group in an effort to devalue our accomplishments and vilify the very notion of minorities finding success simply because it threatens their narrative.  They would rather minorities suffer if it means protecting their narrative.  In fact, they are willfully holding minorities back by telling them they’ll never succeed on their own merits in this country simply due to the color of their skin, a trait minorities can never change.  They call meritocracy evil and racist and pointless for blacks people to participate in, and then when the stats show black people are participating and competing in meritocratic system at lower rates, they’ll blame it on white supremacy to justify the necessity of perpetuating their narrative. It’s all about power, and minorities are seen as stepping stones so long as we continue to buy into the narrative and remain useful as a prop and a voting block.</p>
<p>Democratic politicians are evil.  I used to be a democrat myself but once I scratched through the surface level virtue signaling and saw the beast in it’s true form, I can never unsee what I was blind to before.  I’m glad you are able to see through it as well.</p>
<p>I’m not a Republican either but that’s a different story.</p>

<p>I've in the same position as you. As the solstice gets closer I keep remembering how I was feeling and what I was doing even just a year ago. I thought covid was going to blow over coz by then it was obvious that it was just a flu. I've seen similar things to you in the past year and  a half. I always had a thought in the back of my mind that most people were capable of this, but I thought I was just a misanthropic asshole. I was naive and brainwashed.  I read alot when I was a kid, and all the first-hand accounts from people living in totalitarian regimes make sense now. I never thought it would happen here.</p>

        <p>Ive always been pretty libertarian and anti-government and always questioned authority. But I believed there was some good in the authority and government and that they still had some care to American values, I mean the real ones of freedom and liberty that we were founded on, and cared about us. This last year I have become unquestionably and entirely opposed to our government and all authority to a degree like never before. All the government wants is more control and more money and will stop at literally nothing to get it, including manufacture a virus in a lab and release it so everyone comes running to mommy government to help and hand over their freedoms willingly.</p>
<p>Government is the single greatest source of evil and corruption in this world and I stand by that.</p>
<p>Go ahead, put me on a watch list for anti government extremism, see if I care. You've already destroyed us as a civilization. I won't back down. This is the hill I die on.</p>

        <p>Here's a tip for anyone planning to do public speaking in the future. Instead of imagining everyone naked, remember a large proportion of the audience would lock you in your home, prevent you from seeing your loved ones, take your bodily autonomy and medical freedom.</p>
<p>Never be scared of people again. They'd prevent you from buying food if it came to it.</p>

        <p>OP, I have been particularly cursed with being observant of many of this types of behaviour and incidents happening from the start, and suffered a few myself.</p>
<p>It has been nothing short of destructive in my joy, loyalty or even membership in the country of Canada. The social contract has been broken in so many ways, to me Canada is just an address where I live now.</p>
<p>Never felt so trampled on, disrespected, devalued (non-essential), dismissed and discarded as I have through the last 14 months. No one cares about rights, only their own. </p>
<p>Also, if Canada was so easily cowed and overthrown, it destroys my faith in long-term investment or even having a future now  - AT ALL. In anything.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was the goal. To "Build Back Better" and to 'restructure our world', the goal was to destroy our sense of self and place in the world, to destroy our expectations about our rights and freedoms, to destroy our incomes, to destroy our dreams and goals...</p>
<p>In that way, I cannot allow it, but I'm saying yes - it is felt by all of us.</p>
<p>and most importantly; HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH COVID-19 ITSELF</p>

        <p>I saw glimmers of it after the 2016 election when the media ramped up the anti-Trump propaganda (I have zero feelings about Trump and voted D both times, but I can’t help but see the bizarre and obsessive ways people act about him). </p>
<p>My family left an oppressive country too. Some of my family members are scared that it’s happening in the US and I ignored them as paranoid and ignorant. Now I see it how their fears are reasonable.</p>

<p>Your ring doorbell reports directly to the police. You've got a microphone directly patched to the NSA in every smart device you own. The government is making our money worthless while ramping up spending to unheard of levels. 
Your toxic FDA approved McFood is so bad that US lifespan is now decreasing. Those rights we temporarily gave up to fight terrorism in 2001? Fuck you American wage slave you have no rights. </p>

        <p>Honestly I got here with age and watching the world burn. I'm 38 I was never like this. I was always well mannered and polite and friendly to everyone. It got me nowhere. After this past year I almost think if myself as smarter than most of the masses and their stupidity kills me so I can't fake pretend anymore. At work I keep to myself since I work with too many idiots. I lost a lot of friends because I shut down this past year. I went from social butterfly/life at every party to I can't look at people the same. So now I keep a small group of people like me and my husband and that's all I need.</p>

        <p>No, I knew that people were like this long ago.  However, I didn't think that it would go this far.  I thought that 50%+ knew that the media and politicians lied to them, and they wouldn't go along with it.  I thought that we had enough MEN that we wouldn't see tyrants assaulting wives and mothers.  I thought that we had enough patriots that if tyrants arose, that they would be dealt with like all tyrants should be.</p>

        <p>Totally not, i ve been aware of human stupidity since long, since ppl talk about multiculturalism, feminism, veganism, climate change, religions, fiat money, etc. Covid is only another hoax or bullshit that adds to the moronic believes of all those idiots.<br>
Back in the days, neighbors called the cops for some weed smoke, before that because they were jew, before that because they suspected heresy or fornication ... just the same thing. It has always existed, and will always exist. And ppl are still burned at the stake, it's called doxxing, public shaming or canceling nowadays ...</p>

        <p>Our public schools are teaching CRT but not about our rights, and where the government stands in relation to that.  College graduates can tell you all about micro aggressions and systemic racism and manspreading, and they can list all 400 genders and lecture you on pronoun politics, but they have no idea what our constitution says, why it exists, and why it’s important.</p>
<p>All over Reddit I constantly see the stupid spelling of “freedumbs” to diminish the importance of personal freedoms and natural rights.  I see everyone repeating the same brainless refrain “your freedom ends where other people’s safety begins” to justify condemning hundreds of millions of innocent healthy Americans with no sign of illness to months and months of prolonged house arrest in direct violation to the spirit of the “innocent before proven guilty” principle that stands as one of the pillars that made our country so great at one point.  Instead, they now wholeheartedly believe “guilty before proven innocent, and even when proven innocent (with their own covid tests showing negative for active infection) the innocent must still be treated as if they’re guilty and subjected to restrictions and punishments.”  They don’t realize they are using the same argument that forced the illegal internment of  innocent Japanese Americans during WW2 under the guise of “public safety” and the next time “public safety” is brought up to justify removing the rights of innocent Americans they will once again jump at the opportunity.  They’re all shilling for pharma companies to sell as many vaccines as possible using any means necessary, including social shaming, bullying, and coercion.  When everyone who is willing to succumbs to vaccination, they will use the same tactic to force uptake of the yearly booster shots.  And all the while, they imagine themselves as morally superior heroes for committing these egregious acts against their fellow citizens in service of the the same mega corps they previously condemned and the same government they previously said was corrupt.  In truth, they are barely sentient.</p>
<p>I didn’t see it clearly before, only glimpses of it, but I see it crystal clear now. </p>

        <p>Actually, I've been aware of the massive media manipulation, and how crazy cultish those people who have TDS are. It's just been amplified a shit ton more in 2020. The moment they kept repeating the cumulative data of infected/death and never the data of those who recovered, i get this strange wiff of unsettling pattern that somehow, we're being manipulated to see only 1 thing. And then the that censorship came in pretty much put the nail in the coffin into almost everything covid related.</p>
<p>I'm just in the process of figuring how is it that people can outright support an agenda that literally destroys their own society to justify their fear.</p>

        <p>Yes.  I've learned that media lies and obfuscates in very real terms.</p>
<p>I've learned that I'd been letting news affect my thoughts and moods, when it's all being done as sophisticated propaganda.</p>
<p>If it doesn't smell authentic, I ain't buying it, any more.</p>

        <p>I used to think that people complaining about satanists were far-right Christian radicals who considered everything secular to be satanic.</p>
<p>Now I realize, no, we're actually dealing with a large group of secretly practicing Luciferian pedophile cultists and their minions, who are in positions of power and influence in every area of public life, and who are trying to normalize and push their demented agenda and achieve complete world domination over a much less populated world.</p>

        <p>Their symbolism is all over the place, from the Pope's Audience Hall to the disturbing Gotthard Tunnel opening ceremony, attended by world leaders, to popular culture - movies, television shows, music, art, architecture, design - to corporate logos, and more. A good intro for those new to this is "Out of Shadows Official" on Bitchute, which, while very disturbing, only scratches the surface.</p>
