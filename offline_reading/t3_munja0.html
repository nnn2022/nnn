    <strong>What a day in Canada is like</strong>
    <p><p>Shopping alone in H&amp;M,
Minding my own business,
With no one around me,
Talking on the phone, 
With my mask down,
The lady working there,
Who looked overweight,
Comes to me,
And says,
"Hello sir, if you want to stay in the store,
You need to put up your mask,"
With a little blow to my heart,
And my mental health,
I oblige. </p>
<p>I used to be a happy-go-lucky guy, thinking that people are good. Moved across countries with that naive spirit to land in the libtard land of Canada. But oh, God, every waking moment that I spend outside, I'm reminded of the inherit selfishness and stupidness of people and how much they don't care. If you don't do what they believe in, they'll destroy you and then feel good about themselves. I need to be careful so as not to offend anyone and God forbid show my smile. What a sweet country with its polite people!</p></p>
