    <strong>Help needed</strong>
    <p><p>My mother wants to get the V because she thinks that it will get her more freedom and we have to take it to continue normal life.
She has a lot of health problems..
I tryed to stop her from wanting to take it but we are arguing and it never stops..
I'm tired and don't know what to do.
What will I do if she get problems or even dies from it, I know i will not forgive myself.
She keeps telling me that I waste too much time on the internet and that I must not trust what I saw.
I responded that she must not trust the television either and we start arguing again and again..
What must I do? Forget about it?</p>
<p>Warning : this is not a joke.</p></p>

        <p>It is not your responsibility to make her choices for her, all you can do is give her information and let her decide. I know it's a difficult thing to understand, I've gone through the same thing with my mother. You can't take that burden on. I know you love her, but you have to let that go. Honestly, it would probably be best for someone other than you to expose her to the truth, she will always look at you as her child and therefore thinks that she knows better than you</p>

<p>I second this! Went throught this too and I got to the point where I don't talk about certain topics because she thinks she knows more than me or the "truth".</p>

        <p>Yep, both sets of our parents got the V, even grandparents on my wife’s side got it and now it’s killing her grandma.  Her body just couldn’t take the shock.</p>
<p>We talked to all of them about the possible side effects of getting it and they all made their own choices.</p>

        <p>It's truly remarkably how indoctrinated people are. Brilliant minds and billions of dollars have gone into brainwashing people, and it's worked so well. People immediately went out and subjected themselves to these injections and didn't think twice. I can understand the old people doing it, they grew up in a time where the media and the government were somewhat trustworthy. But young people have unlimited access to information and have plenty of proof that these institutions are corrupt and evil, and even though they are not at risk they went out and took it as well.</p>

        <p>I would probably show her how well following the rules has worked for the people of Los Angeles County and leave it at that. First they stayed home. Then they wore the mask. Then they got the vaccine. And now they are ordered to wear the mask again. Doing what they are told with the promise of getting their freedom back has continually failed. At the end of the day it’s your moms choice. You can’t blame yourself if she gets the vaccine &amp; dies. My parents at 72, dad got the vaccine despite underlying health issues, recently finishing chemo and a pulmonary embolism. So far he’s ok, just had severe arm pain after the first jab. My
Mom got the vaccine despite 72, underlying health issues and having breast cancer. She got the first jab just before the double mastectomy in February and the 2nd jab after it. So far so good. I wish they hadn’t gotten the jab as we have no way of knowing what the long term effects are.</p>

        <p>My mums hasn’t worked for over a year and a half and badly needs to go back to work but she believes the news and the vax lies. Nothing I can say will make her change her mind. I tell her all the time I won’t get the jab and she hates that but I am her son but she thinks that people that don’t have it are daft. It’s draining trying to convince someone of something they don’t believe. I had to nag her for two years to stop smoking as it was killing her, she couldn’t walk up a flight of stairs. She’s stopped now and can breath. It covid was real then it would of killed her but it’s just the flu. The fear kills you and the vax may do.</p>
