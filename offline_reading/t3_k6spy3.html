    <strong>I want to end my life, but I'm too afraid at the same time</strong>
    <p><p>I'm probably gonna get banned again but before that happens, I just want to say this.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you're in your 20s or younger, <strong>there is no future</strong>. None. Zilch. Nada. There is also <strong>no hope for the future</strong> and <strong>nothing to look forward to</strong>. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Many people who have committed suicide during this scam-demic did so because they knew what the future would behold and didn't want to live in the NWO. I also believe that back in January, Kobe Bryant knew what would happen in the coming months, took his kids on that helicopter, convinced the pilot that this would all happen, and purposely crashed the helicopter in an act of suicide. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've talked to people about how I hope I get a heart attack so that I'll die and not experience the NWO sooner rather than later, and they all refer to me as a "spoiled brat" because I'm "not thinking about their feelings." Really? <strong>They would be wise to die with me</strong>. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Oh, we can fight back if enough people revolt!" No, we can't. Yes, we outnumber the national guard by shit-tons, but they have sophisticated weapons that could wipe out a crowd of 10,000 in only three minutes. <strong>There is no fighting back</strong>. Any resistance will result in more lockdowns, more stringent laws, and loss of freedoms. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Honestly, as sociopathic as this makes me feel, I feel lucky for those who have already died/suicide. Why? Because they won't have to experience more lockdowns, loss of private property, FEMA camps, society barring (no vaccine, no participation), cashless societies, the successor to the dollar which will make gas $20/gallon and you'll be taxed 99.8% of your revenue with no loopholes, death if you're right-wing, and vaccines every day for the rest of your fucking life!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The reason why I'm afraid of suicide is because of the concept of Hell. If Hell is in fact a real place of eternal torment, and those (even believers) who commit suicide automatically end up there, I won't be able to go along with it and will be stuck here on earth for at least two more decades. That is, unless I "accidentally" break one of the rules which will result in robots shooting me dead. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Be thankful for what you have <strong>right now</strong>, because by December 4, 2021, you won't have any of it. You'll be dead (if you're lucky), in prison getting raped every other day because you broke one of the endless rules, or in a FEMA camp working hard labor 22 hours a day and getting mercilessly whipped while doing so.</p></p>

        <p>Not all of them. Maybe look for a GP or Psych NP. That’s what I did. I’m 27. It’s bad but not as bad as you’re describing. Please get some help! There are great Christian based therapy options.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s that uncommon, just not spoken of very often. My point being, there is help and there are providers out there who still deeply care about conservative values. Usually they market themselves as faith based providers but they’ll definitely respect someone like you. Please look into it.</p>

        <p>A few things here. Your life has meaning, it matters. If you decide to terminate your life, you are letting these psychopaths, and anti-human bigots win. Do NOT give them satisfaction! </p>
<p>Some of us are fighting back however we can. Remember while these billionaire parasites, government goons and their collaborators can kill our businesses, attempt to take away our freedoms, they can not kill the idea that men are born free and there men and women who will fight to be free.</p>
<p>While those people who have committed suicide, I disagree with the reasons why they ended their lives, and which is of least excuse, I do not think they to be mentally weak or sick, they simply just didn't understand all of their options.</p>
<p>The people instigating these lock downs are very evil people, they are willing to let you think like you are now, and have no problem having people starve to death, lose their homes, livelihoods, spouses and including their lives. That's how evil they are, to them, they want to convince you, and you're believing it, that your life does not value, so please kill yourself. That is what they want you to believe. But if you can hear us out, if you can read this, your life has meaning and value. You don't think it does because of the Kool-Aid by the mainstream media, and their collaborators. Remember, the American Revolution was not won over night, many people suffered but they suffered for a good cause, the right to live, the right to be free. </p>
<p>I'm not saying go out there guns blazing, and shooting folks. I am saying you should fight like we are, by speaking out, by living and telling these billionaire parasites, these government goons, and their collaborators that you are not going to go down this easy in the night, that you're going to fight until your last freaking breath, and oppose them at every step of the way.</p>
<p>Also, if you need to do the unthinkable, please talk to some one, any body. You have us here.</p>

        <p>The point is not to win, the point is to destroy your opponents will to keep fighting. Ever read the book the Art of War by Sun Tzu? The Vietnamese used the very tactics Sun Tzu used against us. Technically, we wiped the floor with the Vietnamese. We never lost a battle but they killed our spirit to keep fighting. Same thing with American Revolution, we lost the majority of battles against the British Empire, the most powerful army at the time, but guess what? We killed their willingness and spirit to keep fighting. </p>
<p>Look at Iraq and Afghanistan, same thing. We have beaten the insurgents in every battle, but they have killed our willingness to keep fighting and stay in those countries. Keep in mind, we have the most powerful weapons, and military but for some odd reason those pesky Taliban Mujehadeen fighters, and Iraqi insurgents keep fighting.</p>
<p>Destroy your opponents will to fight, and he will surrender on your terms. Read the book the Art of War, and you will see the answer is right before you. Understand yourself, and understand your enemy, and in 100 battles you will see victory. However, if you understand yourself, and not the enemy, in 100 battles, you will see 50 defeats. But if you neither understand the enemy or yourself then in 100 battles, you will most definitely see 100 defeats.</p>
<p>The answer to your question is to not fight at the enemies advantage, you must force them to fight at your advantage, once you have done that, the path to victory is not in doubt.</p>
<p>Here's the book of the Art of War, I highly recommend it. Once you have read, and understand Sun Tzu's view of the world, then employing his tactics will be trivial. Remember, the greatest battles ever fought were fought with the intellect and not brawn.</p>
<p>The book is so powerful that you can apply the tactics to every day life, that is another discussion. If you want, we can discuss offline. I have read this book countless time, and it is probably one of the most enlightening book I have ever read.</p>

        <p>Wow. The pessimist and optimist have one thing in common, both tend to be right.</p>
<p>If you choose hopelessness, you will die. But if you choose hope, you are one of the living because men don't die when their pulse stops, of old age or heart attack. Most die way before that, when they lose their hope.</p>

        <p>i hope this message reaches you in time: you are loved and you matter and there will ALWAYS be a group of us rebels who will find a way, by any means necessary, to live free. even in the matrix a society of people existed outside of the sheep world. even in the hunger games a large plot to overthrow the elites took place. (you know about how they use movies to program...) the rebel spirit is alive and we will always support each other and fight to the death. you are not alone. we need more soldiers. please stay with us. we need you.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your words, but we'll never have enough soldiers. Just look at another post on here that says that 250M people in India are revolting, but nothing will happen. They're just making it worse for the rest of the Indians when they go twofold on the draconian measures as punishment.</p>

        <p>This is exactly how I’ve been feeling deep down ever since this started. I’ve also had the added bonus of considering that maybe Hell is a place made up by The Powers That Be to keep the potentially unruly peasants (I.e. us) in line &amp; keeping them safe from us while they do the most depraved shit.</p>
<p>That said, consider this: they WANT you to kill yourself. It’s a win for them: one less slave to deal with. Yes, they want to chip you, but they don’t mind you dying either. They did say depopulation was on the agenda. EVERY DAY you stay alive, being happy, living your life ACTUALLY NORMALLY, is an act of rebellion, and the ultimate fuck you to these bastard Satan-spawn tyrants.</p>

        <p>I asbolutely feel where you're coming from and in most ways I even agree. I've even had the same dark thoughts about how my dead friends and family members are the <em>lucky ones</em>.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>I've come to the conclusion that for 99% of human history, life has been pain and war. It's only in the last 60 or so years where we in the west have been raised to think that life is all about positive progression, equality, roses, and rainbows.</p>
<p>Be prepared to fight. Be prepared to be done wrong and treated unfairly. Be prepared to die. <strong>Life is pain.</strong> You might as well stick around and see what happens because no matter how bad it gets, it's only temporary.</p>

        <p>Wow, this really shows how much different perspectives change reality. </p>
<p>I see the same future you do, and I am absolutely pumped. I hope they accelerate their bullshit and lock me out of society ASAP.</p>
<p>Everyone intelligent and mentally free will be forced into independent communities, where I can find them. Living in a cabin, free of surveillance tech, surrounded by unique people sounds like heaven.</p>
<p>I would rather spend 2 weeks there than 200 years in this new structure. Before this global reset started, society wasn't doing great to begin with, barely worth the effort. </p>
<p>I feel optimistic and excited for the future.</p>
<p>If you want to feel better you should go for a run or exercise, eat a good meal, and stop being bleak and afraid. The future for us is great. The future for people who hate us are fucked, but they like getting fucked so leave them to it.</p>

        <p>I've come to the exact same conclusions as you, but you're wrong that there is no future. You don't need social interaction, leisure, and stuff like that for greatness. You just need your mind and to surround yourself with other great people.</p>
<p>I hope you will hold on, because much better times are coming. The only way to thwart their overwhelming domination is by the intervention of an even greater power. Can't go into the details, but I know of a realistic plan to activate that power that someone is working on. It might take some years - but once it's there the sheep can get unblinded and we can easily take back power by sheer numbers alone.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I'm still doing what I can to wake people up. It may seem hopeless, but to me, I still have hope. It's just that right now, they are doing things so fast that it's a house of cards. If enough people see it for what it is, then it will all be over. </p>
<p>I have faith that it won't end badly, and I think that this sub has seen an explosive growth and hence more people are aware than there hasn't been. But even if it goes badly, then suicide becomes the only way out. </p>
<p>But before that, I'll do what can to wake others up.</p>

        <p>Statistically, liberal echo chambers have a way higher amount of mentally ill people, and they kill themselves far more often.</p>

        <p>No, the mentally ill ratio is the same, the difference is that those in other places, people are willing to admit it and get help for their issues, no matter how minor they may be, unlike other areas that ignore it because they think it makes them tough to not admit that they might have a problem or think others will see it as a weakness to exploit and therefore don't seek help to fix it.</p>
