    <strong>Pertinent Quote from Rules for Radicals</strong>
    <p><p>In an effort to educate myself on the avenues that we have available to break the spell that most of the world is under, I have been reading through <em>Rules for Radicals</em> by Saul Alinsky. The following quote jumped out at me:</p>
<p>&rt; Just as the clash of interests with the Have-a-Little, Want Mores has bred so many of the great leaders it has also spawned a particular breed stalemated by cross interests into inaction. These Do-Nothings profess a commitment to social change for ideals of justice, equality, and opportunity, and then abstain from and discourage all effective action for change. They are known by their brand, "I agree with your ends but not your means". They function as blankets whenever possible smothering sparks of dissension that promise to flare up into the fire of action.</p>
<p>Now I don't really care for the Marxism inspired class distinctions myself, but I still find that this quote accurately describes a great number of people in this world, many of whom are on our side (if only in secret). </p>
<p>Want to know why the people (if only the sizeable minority of us who are opposed to the madness) have not already revolted? I think that this has alot to do with it.</p></p>
