        <p>This is what I’ve been saying all along. The virus was already spreading all over the globe with international travel out of China. </p>
<p>Sooo what happened from December 2019 to March 2020? Nothing. Life was NORMAL. No panic. No hysteria. No masks. No social distancing. Hospitals were not overwhelmed. </p>
<p>We went to concerts. Ate at restaurants. Traveled to see family for the holidays. </p>
<p>The only difference now is the media: we weren’t being bombarded with fear porn and daily tracking of cases and deaths. </p>
<p>All this madness needs to stop.</p>

        <p>Has anyone come up with an argument against this? I know doomers like to explain things away, but I can think of a good reason why this hasn't been spreading since it was first known about.</p>

        <p>So to those of you keeping track, since then we've had Hanukkah, Christmas, New Years, Chinese New Years, Super Bowl, Mardi Gras, Valentine's Day, and some of St. Patrick's Day, as well as all the countless sports events, concerts and gatherings. Yet we've managed to convince everyone that this was only around beginning in mid-March. If we weren't in danger then, we're certainly not in danger now. The only difference is that testing, media fixation, and public neurosis about it have gone way up since then.</p>
