        <p>Content of post until post is approved in r/Conservative:</p>
<p>I have a long story and will try to condense it to the best of my ability.
I‚Äôm Matthew, lifetime conservative, currently entering my Sophomore year of college, but today that doesn‚Äôt matter. Today, I‚Äôm just another college student who wants to be able to go back to doing what I love: being a music major concentrating in vocal performance, minoring in political science, studying the Japanese language to become an ESL teacher and learning law as I study to become a lawyer.
My university is Hofstra University, which some of you probably at least have heard about because they seem to host a ton of presidential debates there.
For my entire life I have grown up with a medical disability that has resulted in my severe dairy allergy, eventually mutating into an allergy to cousins of Penicillin and even Ibuprofen. I‚Äôm probably allergic to more substances I have no clue about. Today, I got a signed statement from my nurse practitioner that said she agreed based upon my allergy assertions that I should be deferred the COVID-19 vaccination until further notice. Well apparently following all the exemption protocols wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúenough‚Äù for Hofstra. Instead they decided to hell with a licensed professional‚Äôs opinion, they want ALL of my medical records supporting my reactions, an updated signed statement from the NP saying the time period of the exemption and which EXACT ingredient I am certified allergic to (note that is like saying go get the shot and if you die woopsie not our problem, but hey if you survive you now qualify for an exemption! Wow gee thanks didn‚Äôt think of that üòí). Just to clarify here, I‚Äôve gone anaphylactic at least 10-11 times since age 11 where I was or should have been hospitalized. Many of those times we don‚Äôt know the allergen that put me fully over the edge. I have almost died from my condition on MULTIPLE occasions. Even my work, schools and activities have all made appropriate accommodations for me. Even my DEPARTMENT is very supportive of me, but the university has fought me tooth and nail on this issue to the point that there isn‚Äôt really any recourse other than the tort system in NY which is also VERY unfavorable to people in my position.
I know many commenters may say ‚Äúgo to a different school‚Äù well that‚Äôd be great and all except I‚Äôm in very niche programs and transferring would NOT be in my best interests. I‚Äôm definitely not high on funds, but I‚Äôm working towards organizing a fundraising page and getting more students to co-sign onto this. A university that backs professors whom allowed students to openly mock me for speaking the truth of conservatism in an American Politics class and now refuses to hand an exemption despite opening the door to a swarm of liability should not be able to continue its malicious practices! Please stand with me.

This case could really mean life or death for me, so I‚Äôd appreciate your support for choice in any way you can!
Donations can be sent to https://www.paypal.me/matthewtrani. Please if you choose to donate mark doing so, it will make it easier for me to place those contributions aside until I can figure out a more permanent solution.
Good night, god bless, keep fighting!</p>

        <p>You are exactly right. The doctors are insane. Clearly you should be exempt. But they love their power and control and like you said they won't know you, they will disavow you if anything goes wrong. Stay strong!! Don't get injected. Take a gap year if need be.</p>

        <p>Also found out I‚Äôm allergic to polyethylene glycol because I‚Äôm allergic to Ibuprofen.  Now the uni won‚Äôt even have that excuse.  We cannot let them get away with this!</p>
