    <strong>Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. And, weak men create hard times.</strong>
    <p><p>Today in quebec a group of 260 gyms who threatened to open their gym tomorrow despite goverment puting them on lock down backed down from their threat.</p>
<p>This is really symtomatic of a deep problem of why this is being aloud to go on. Ut truly feels many men are simply weak because have had such a long period of good and easy times. Men have luterally forgot how to fight for their rights and the importance to do so.</p>
<p>Because this is a society of weak men living off the benefits of past societies of strong men. We are heading towards extreme hard times</p></p>

        <p>I was just talking to someone this morning about what soft bellied dogs we have become. No one has the strength or fortitude to make a stand, everyone wants us to lock down again to sit on their ass and get paid to eat and watch movies out of “fear for the virus and their lives” ha. Our country was founded by people willing to die for their rights, and now its run by people begging them to get them taken away to FEEL safe, not even actually BE safe (they can’t grasp the long term consequences of this). Hard times to be in indeed.</p>

        <p>That's actually looking at the symptom, not the root cause.</p>
<p>The real cause is tendency for people to gather together in one, super densely populated area, causing overpopulation.</p>
<p>John Calhoun was the scientist behind what became known as the "mouse utopia". He wanted to see the effect of overpopulation on cities in developed nations.</p>
<p>All the symptoms shown by the mouse utopia are shown in human societies today.</p>
<p>-Increased violence.</p>
<p>-Fight over resources and land despite being plentiful</p>
<p>-Socially Recluse</p>
<p>-Strong females, and females that become head of the family. Conversely, the males turn out to be weak</p>
<p>-Sexual perversion(same gender, multiple partners, etc)</p>
<p>The thing is, overpopulation alone isn't enough, because third world countries do not show this issue. The second factor is economic prosperity. Overpopulation has to be combined with prosperous economies.</p>
<p>The mouse-land didn't have any predators and had water and food beyond what they needed. You can see Japan is at the forefront of societal problems, because they are heavily overpopulated, and are very rich. Relatively recently I've heard South Korea is going to quickly overcome Japan in this regard, because they are even more densely populated.</p>
