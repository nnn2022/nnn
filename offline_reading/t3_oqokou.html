<title>People who have cared for a really sick person know it’s a 24hr/day commitment. Do you have someone who can devote their life to caring for you if are injured by the clotshot? Can you do this for someone else financially/emotionally? Are you/your family in a position to endure a lifelong disability?</title>

        <p>If you are stupid enough to take the vaxx and suffer significant injury from it, you will find out the government sees you as less than human, a piece of trash that needs to be kicked to the curb. Watch some of the testimonies on <a href="https://c19vaxreactions.com">c19vaxreactions.com</a> to understand what I'm talking about. Dirty, soiled underwear has more value than a vaxx-injured person.</p>

        <p>I’ve thought about that. I’m middle aged, and I’m healthy. I live alone. I have no children. I have no family close by. I live a solitary independent life. If I took that shot and had a stroke at home, I would die alone in my house. If I lived, I would end up losing everything and get moved into a nursing home until I die. The state would take my home to pay my medical bills. That is not how I want to go out. I know life has risks and I could have a stroke tomorrow without the shot, but I’ve decided I’m going to minimize my risks. And not taking that shot at least removes that risk. I may still be at risk for catching covid, but I’m still at risk for catching it WITH the shot. People calling me selfish for not taking the shot….well, are they going to step up and take care of me when I can’t talk, feed myself, or go to the bathroom on my own? I think not. All of this rabid foaming at the mouth rage, from people wishing a painful death on those of us who chose not to take the shot, frightens me. The division and hatred caused by a shot has been mind boggling. I never took a flu shot either, and people don’t freak out every year and wish death upon me for that. This world has gone insane.</p>

        <p>What's worse than death? Lifelong disability with no one to care for you. If that's not a valid enough concern they should be handing out million dollar settlements with every injury.</p>

        <p>Civil lawsuits are not really an option for the average person anyway. Lawyers cost a lot of money, their fees will eat into your damages payment. It may take years for your case to be heard in court. You're up against a big company with fancy lawyers. You have no guarantee of winning.
It's best to avoid a lawsuit if possible.
Winning this particular lawsuit won't make you regain your health.
It's even better to avoid sickness or injury.</p>

        <p>Those reports can be made by anyone and you people seem to think the vaccine is supposed to make us immortal. Just because someone dies after taking the vaccine due to a discrete cause doesn’t mean the death was caused by the vaccine. People die everyday and with hundreds of millions of people getting vaccinated (most of them being old and/or with underlying conditions) its highly likely some people will die after receiving the vaccine. Doesn’t mean the deaths were caused by the vaccine.</p>
