    <strong>What is happening to /r/coronavirus lately? It's improved so much in the span of only 2 months!</strong>
    <p><p>It's so surrreal, I would've never expected this, but I've seen plenty of posts here and on coronaviruscirclejerk about so much based comments lately, coming from that subreddit, which used to be considered doomer central. The tide is changing so fast and it's amazing!</p></p>

        <p>Honestly I think this is because a lot of people on r/coronavirus expected to be going back to normal once a vaccine comes out, which is why they were really doomerish last year. But now that the vaccine is being distributed and news articles are coming out stating that "vaccines aren't a silver bullet" and "why you need to indefinitely socially distance even after vaccination" they are getting pissed and are finally questioning whats going on.</p>

        <p>I'd wager that every goalpost-movement shakes off a few doomers to our side. This one was definitely a big one. I just wish we would all stop complying. There's nothing the government can do about it except complain.</p>

        <p>Exactly, like with these fucking lockdowns, whats stopping every business from not complying? I promise you if every last business in a town trying to impose a lockdown refused to shut down the government couldn't do shit about it, not enough fines could be handed out, at worse a strongly worded statement would be put out, but who gives a fuck? Those statements are worth less than toilet paper.</p>

        <p>I think ultimately the disconnect with this entire situation is that if you believe restrictions are really necessary, then there is no logical reason to ever stop restrictions if the virus is not eradicated, so the loop never ends. The only logic being used is that if something may reduce the spread it needs to be mandated, and since that will never change there is no way out. That’s why we need to go back to a clear decisive goal like widespread access to the vaccine or no overwhelmed hospitals.</p>

        <p>Exactly, everyone's been told it was the last goal post ever since this started. Most only complied with shit just to get to this goal post. Now that we are here, no one will allow it to be moved again, they've already decided this is it, and after that they're going back to normal.</p>

They have decided it has been taken over by bots (btw the trope that any opinion you have being rejected en masse must be a result of “bots” needs to die)</p>

        <p>It really is bizarre that only r/coronavirus has changed, but whether it’s bots or not, it helps us. I will say that sub does seem to be going over the top with vaccines to an almost comical level, so maybe the bot/shill emphasis has went that direction.</p>

        <p>I’ve been saying for a while that the availability of the vaccine is the line in the sand for most people when it comes to tolerating all these restrictions. I think we’re seeing that play out.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m not encouraging people to get the vaccine and I’m not getting it, just speculating about how the average person thinks. But downvote away I guess 🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>Conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>The same bots that spread fear that sold the pandemic to the masses, have been reset to spread calmness.  </p>
<p>The big tech companies have made fortunes and now if life doesn't get back to normal soon, their won't be a country left to suck wealth from.</p>
<p>USA will be reopened 100 days after Biden's inauguration.</p>
<p>PCR tests tuned down, vaccinated population will be high, and most of all it'll be nice weather again.</p>
<p>My guess, the bots have been programmed to spread hope and calmness as opposed to 24/7 fear.  They have to slowly shift the narrative now so people will be ready to be back to normal.</p>
<p>Hell, check out the top post of /r/news right.  Its the top post about cuomo sending covid positive nursing home patients back to their nursing home.  We've known about since May 2020.  But now, they're exposing it.  </p>
