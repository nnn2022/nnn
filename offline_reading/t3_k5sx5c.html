    <strong>Reactions over coworker “testing positive” are awful</strong>
    <p><p>This is just from my experience. This morning I went to work and was informed that a coworker had tested positive for covid (who cares; big fuckin deal). On one had, we all received the usual email “one of your coworkers tested positive,” while saying they can’t reveal the identity (why would they, anyway?) for privacy reasons. And on the other, another supervisor just comes out and says who it was (small store in a large company, few employees, it would be very obvious anyway, but that’s no excuse). </p>
<p>So beyond the disturbing violations of privacy and medical health records, other coworkers reacted negatively against this employee. One kept repeating that he couldn’t believe this person would put them in “that position” (employee had a minor symptom for a couple days, went to work while awaiting test results, and happened to touch another employee as per usual). He said “he’s a nice guy, but...” as if perfectly normal behavior a year ago is now somehow a character flaw. Another employee remarked “so-and-so tested positive for covid! And he came to work anyway!” or something along those lines (again - exhibited minor symptom, got tested, went to work while waiting for result). </p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever worked  at a company where everyone stayed home when felt sick. In fact, someone calling out because they’re sick was considered somewhat of a bad thing - everyone else shows up sick, why can’t you? You must not be a very dedicated employee. Now we shit on the people who might continue doing what was once a normal thing, or be dedicated to their job, or just plain don’t know how to act without proof. I really hate what this fearmongering has done. These restrictions and infringements on our liberties and rights need to end. </p>
<p>(Fearmongering and security theater are also appropriate flairs, I think.)</p></p>

        <p>Covid is now a moral failure somehow and I truly can’t understand how we’ve gotten here. It’s a virus doing what viruses do, there’s no reaction like this to <em>literally</em> any other common illnesses, so why now? </p>
<p>Oh yeah, because it’s The Deadliest Disease Ever, silly me</p>

        <p>Why do people keep running out and getting tested, especially when they don’t intend to stay home? Although, I do think people should stay home when sick.  I understand why people go work she they don’t have sick leave.</p>

        <p>I literally got called out on Slack by our office hypochondriac this week after mentioning "I had Covid a couple weeks ago, but not to worry because I hadn't been to the office anywhere around that time". (I work with a small company and we've been remote since March, but still go to the office for various things now and then.) </p>
<p>I was up there a month ago for about 30 minutes while this person was at a desk about 25 feet away from me, so no contact at all really. We have a loose policy of wearing masks if you're in the office, but few of us rarely do, self included, so of course I was maskless. </p>
<p>After all the "omg are you ok? How was it?" etc. replies to my announcement the first thing this person says is "You were at the office Nov 2 and didn't wear a mask." </p>
<p>I replied yeah, but that was about 13 days before the earliest onset of symptoms so there's almost no chance I had it then, and besides that it was a month ago so obviously it doesn't even matter because no one else got sick. </p>
<p>Their reply: "Well you just need to know that there was a risk there and a real reason to worry because you endangered me by not wearing a mask."</p>
<p>Fuck. Off. Karen.</p>

        <p>Having covid if your fault, you somehow did something wrong to catch it, and if you spread it, that is your fault and you didn’t do enough to protect someone else. /s </p>
<p>This is the way, apparently. It’s a disgusting thought process. I’d say spreading covid is now perceived as badly as knowingly spreading hiv, but California lowered the punishment from a felony to a misdemeanor, so here it’s probably actually considered worse.</p>

        <p>Another reason I'm simply not going to get tested no matter how I feel. The test is irrelevant. It brings no benefit to me, only costs and drawbacks. If I do experience symptoms, I will lie about and conceal them. If absolutely necessary I will call in one or two generic sick days.</p>

        <p>We had a temp call in sick on a Monday, and got a new temp to temporarily replace her (sounds weird) for the rest of the week because of it. Right now, the idea of being sick at all is an unnerving one because they’ll treat you like a leper in case you might have that darn covid.</p>

        <p>Thankfully this isn’t the case with my company, at least not yet. We had another coworker “test positive” for covid a month or so ago, and there wasn’t the same negative reaction. But he was a custodial type position, always wore gloves because he was cleaning the building during the day, so he didn’t stay in one place too long. I guess everyone assumed they were “safe” with that one.</p>

        <p>We've all been remote since March and my company still sends out emails naming the person who got infected and saying if anyone has had any contact with them to be aware... I wouldn't even tell my work if I had it I'd just call out sick if I was sick and that's it.</p>
