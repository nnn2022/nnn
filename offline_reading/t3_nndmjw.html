    <strong>I identify as vaccinated.</strong>
    <p><p>Whatcha gonna do about it?</p>
<p>I mean.. biologically, I did not get injected with messenger RNA, but I <em>feel</em> like I have. </p>
<p>Wait, you have a problem with that?</p>
<p>Are you some sort of intolerant, xenophobic POS?</p></p>

        <p>I sexually identify as vaccinated. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of walking into Kroger shooting masks onto disgusting Trump supporters. People say to me that herd immunity is impossible and I'm fucking anti-science but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a tattoo artist ink a copy of a vaccine card and a picture of the virus with a mask over it on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Jabby" and respect my right to virtue signal on Facebook. If you can't accept me, you're an anti-vaxxer and need to check your scientific privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.</p>

        <p>I've had an MMR, Tdap, HPV, and a number of others so when people ask if I've been 'vaccinated' then yeah, I have been, and I know at least one was made by pfizer so it's tempting to say: Yes, I did get my vax, the pfizer one. But I don't. I prefer to let people know not everyone is getting it. I also don't think engaging in transphobia is beneficial because it's going to repel a lot of possible allies and the LGBTQ+ would be a powerful ally.</p>

        <p>You do realise no one is claiming to change their chromosomes and shit, right? Gender has been proven to have very little if anything to do with anatomy. Sex =/= gender, they’re two different things. Sex is biological, meaning said chromosomes and shit.</p>

        <p>&rt;You mad the left decides one can decide its own biological state of being</p>
<p>No one is saying any such thing, but it's understandable that you might think that. No one is saying that a transwoman is biologically an XX woman, or that a transman is biologically an XY man. To present such an argument is a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">straw man fallacy</a>.</p>
<p>So what is being said?</p>
<p>Transgender people were born with brains that more closely match the brains of the sex they weren't born as. As such, they feel more comfortable transitioning their bodies to more closely match their brains, and living their lives in a way that makes them feel more comfortable and happy.</p>
<p>Do you have a problem with that? Let me guess, it's "unnatural"? Let's talk about that.</p>
<p>Is left-handedness unnatural? Is down syndrome unnatural? Is being a twin unnatural? Are heart transplants unnatural?</p>
<p>My point is that not everything that is natural is a good thing (skin cancer, down syndrome), and not everything that's unnatural is a bad thing (organ transplants, cell phones).  Being transgender happens to be naturally occurring (Google transgender figures in history, it's not new), though hormone treatment is not natural. But we don't make fun of someone for being born with a fucked up heart. He offer our condolences, and hope their heart surgery goes well. Same with transgender people. They were born with a mismatch, so we offer our condolences and hope their surgery goes well (or whatever their doctor recommends).</p>
<p>Identifying as "vaccinated" though, is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard. But I'll take your word for it, if you're willing to prove it. Get injected with COVID-19. Not the vaccine, the whole virus. If you "identify" as vaccinated, you'll be fine! If not...</p>

        <p>&rt;homosexuality is not natural, but it's not a distortion of reality.</p>
<p>I know this is the last thing you said, but homosexuality occurs in nature, making this statement the easiest part to disprove.  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/us/gay-penguin-couple-egg-zoo-berlin-trnd/index.html">Gay penguins</a>, are usually the easiest example to jump to. <a href="https://www.earthtouchnews.com/videos/wildlife-raw-uncut/homosexual-giraffes-do-what-comes-naturally/">about 5% of giraffes are gay.</a>. There's <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior">even a Wikipedia page</a> listing quite a few animal species that we've observed homosexual behavior in, including some groups you wouldn't expect, such as fish and insects. Homosexuality is a lot more natural than you might think.</p>
<p>I probably don't need to tell you that human homosexuality isn't new either, but just in case, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_homosexuality">you can take a scroll through this Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
<p>Okay! Back to what we were talking about before.</p>
<p>&rt;Why do men HAVE to be stoic and assertive? Why do women HAVE to be quiet and agreeable?</p>
<p>I don't believe this. I apologize if I gave that impression.</p>
<p>&rt;What is a 'male brain'?</p>
<p>&rt;What is a 'female brain'?</p>
<p>This is a really good question, and one that gets a bit complicated. The first important thing to mention is that our brains are more similar than they are different. Differences that create gender, political beliefs, identity, etc. are very small and detailed in comparison to the whole structure. The second important thing to mention is that science hasn't fully mapped out the brain yet, and has a LOT to learn about it going forward. This is not a completed science in the way electrical engineering might be considered to be.</p>
<p>The third thing is that the idea of a "gendered brain" is highly controversial. I used that terminology in my previous statement because it makes communication of ideas simpler and easier, but the truth is that things are much more complicated. Some neurologists say that when you account for size differences between men's brains and women's brains, the major structural differences we have documented disappear. Others argue that there are structural circuitry differences in the brain, and will point to certain regions or grey matter/white matter ratios. For a non-neurologist like me to try and parse through this controversial debate is difficult. It's not something I feel confident I can give a good answer about.</p>
<p>So why did I say transmen's brains more resemble cismen's brains, and transwomen's brains more resemble ciswomen's brains?  <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/research-on-the-transgender-brain-what-you-should-know/">Because of articles like this.</a>. Here are a few insightful quotes:</p>
<p>&rt;“When we look at the transgender brain, we see that the brain resembles the gender that the person identifies as,” Dr. Altinay says. For example, a person who is born with a penis but ends up identifying as a female often actually has some of the structural characteristics of a “female” brain.</p>
<p>&rt;“We’re also finding some functional similarities between the transgender brain and its identified gender,” Dr. Altinay says.</p>
<p>&rt;In studies that use MRIs to take images of the brain as people perform tasks, the brain activity of transgender people tends to look like that of the gender they identify with.</p>
<p>&rt;“Research in these areas is extremely limited, and more research needs to be done to find conclusive results,” Dr. Altinay notes. “But we’re already seeing definite trends.”</p>
<p>I recommend checking out the whole article, it's pretty interesting.</p>
<p>We know enough to know that one's gender identity is hardwired into the brain, but we don't yet know enough to understand why that is. It's like how we know that the speed of light is the fastest any particle can go in the universe, but we don't understand why that is yet.  Hopefully we find better answers in the future, but for the time being this is the limit of our knowledge.</p>

<p>This is not a normal vaccine. In fact, by definition, it's not a vaccine.</p>
<p>Unless they recently changed the word's definition.</p>
