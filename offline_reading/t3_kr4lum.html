    <strong>They are just blind.</strong>
    <p><p>They really are sucked in to a false reality. A virtual reality where they see bodies all over the place. In real life, we are just not seeing that. We are being shown numbers and being told they're caused by something we should be very afraid of. </p>
<p>I do not deny this virus exists. Im not qualified or in any position to deny or confirm its existence. I can only go off what I see, and the information I receive. </p>
<p>I believe it probably does exist, and is deadly for those with weakened immune systems. </p>
<p>Same with the vaccine, I can not say it is either safe or not safe because I simple do not know. Chances I have weighed up in my own mind from things that I do know, is that it i seem to be more at risk from potential adverse reactions from the vaccine than I would be from the virus. </p>
<p>I think I have a fairly balanced view on both the virus and the vaccine. Yet as soon as I mention a doubt I have about the vaccine (which is perfectly normal) to a friend her automatic reaction is to remind me that the virus exists. As if I have denied it!</p>
<p>"I know people who have had it and who have died <em>stupid fucking monkey face emoji</em>" 
Fucking excellent. I also know people who have supposedly had it. I also know that you do not know any one person who has died from it and these are second hand accounts youre telling me about that you've seen on Facebook. You inform me of everything, remember! </p>
<p>"There are side effects with everything though" as I tell her the effects that people could face from the vaccine. Completely blinded to the fact my chances of being affected by the virus are miniscule to non existent. </p>
<p>"You don't know that it won't kill you. My friends friend died and they had no health problems" 
So there is a freak chance it kills me, yes. I fucking wish it would at this point. 
But there is more data and evidence to suggest that I would not be knocking on deaths door if I caught the virus. The evidence is not there to say that that wouldn't be the case if I took the vaccine though. </p>
<p>Why can't people see this. There is more evidence to show that healthy individuals will be fine if they caught the virus, than there is to suggest a healthy person would be fine if they took the vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>You’re a more evolved mind than the people you speak of. That’s the simple truth. They are utterly delusional. Trapped in their dogma. Trapped in fear.</p>

        <p>Yes, yes, yes!</p>
<p>I fucking hate that argument "it may kill you". The fucking flu may kill you, but we don't routinely jab the healthy for that because it's a waste of fucking money.</p>
<p>I agree with absolutely everything you have said. Just because you think you would be better off gaining natural immunity rather than taking a vaccine (a view which I share btw), does not mean you deny the existance of SARS-CoV-2, and it does not mean you deny that it can kill some vulnerable people. You live in reality, all these hysterical dunces do not.</p>
