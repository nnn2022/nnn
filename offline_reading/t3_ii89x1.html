<title>The anthropogenic global warming theory, as a distinct part of this revolution, was never really about the climate, any more than defunding the police is about systemic racism. The whole thing is about power. It is a pretext for seizing power.</title>

        <p>Central to both is promoting the results of computer models as scientific truth.</p>
<p>Computer models are very useful in science as adjunct <em>tools</em> to develop useful hypotheses. Scientists always modeled their ideas - inside their head.  The computer allows vastly more input data to be used, and the testing of many more variables.  Yet, it is a creation of the programmer, no more, no less. the programmer must weigh the importance of each variable, the accuracy and coherence of the input data, recognize and eliminate their own biases, and most critical, create the best model of what's happening in reality.  It's not just "garbage in, garbage out" but also, "weak/sloppy programming, garbage out".</p>
<p>The final test of a model is to run it using past data to ensure its output reflects today's conditions.  Pretty much all of the climate models failed that test, skewing much warmer than reality.  And the older modeling runs from 10-20 years ago resulted in exactly the same thing: it's much cooler in 2020 than they predicted.  But the researchers wanted to keep getting grant funding, they so kept saying that the models were the reality. And the politicians kept funding them as long as they continued to predict doom.</p>
<p>I can't believe that Ferguson and his Imperial College team weren't laughed out of the room at the beginning of all this. Their models sucked - and on all previous diseases, overestimated infection/death rates by orders of magnitude - as they did this time. It seems that their garbage predictions were accepted in spite of that, to use as a pretext for political action.</p>

        <p>I disagree.  I think that people in power feel like they are obligated to use their power to save the world however they never have enough to actually solve the  problems so they need more.  Things like climate change and racism are legit problems.</p>

        <p>The guy who produced the hockey stick graph used in An Inconvenient Truth, refused in court to release the information backing his graph. It's a fraud.</p>
