    <strong>Happy Mask-Free Monday to the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</strong>
    <p><p>Masks are no longer required by law, but apparently you can be thrown off Transport for London for not wearing one ðŸ¤” What's your experience so far?</p></p>

        <p>I live opposite a Junior/infant school, it was wonderful to see this morning, in glorious sunshine all the parents taking their kids to school maskless, laughing and joking, talking to each other at the gates, kids laughing and playing</p>
<p>Instead of the previous year of scurrying past, head down , masked up, avoiding eye contact and dragging their kids along as fast as they could and occasionly shouting hello to each other from across the road</p>

        <p>I went to tesco this morning. Was expecting to see lots of happy smiling faces. Unfortunately like all cults when the narrative gets challenged they defend their ideology more vigorously. Would say 90% of customers were wearing masks and 50% of staff</p>

        <p>That was the same around here when they finally dropped the mandate. Took a couple months, but now hardly anybody is wearing one.</p>

        <p>Around 20% are choosing to breath normally today. Many are still wearing masks because "cases are going up", although without any context ie amount tested, this is not a straightforward understanding. Also, if cases are going up, masks obviously didn't work anyway.</p>

        <p>I have not been wearing one on the tube for a long time now and have just been carrying on as normal. I think more and more people will slowly take them off even on London transport now.</p>

        <p>Same thing happened to me at a pub a couple of weeks ago with my brother and his mate. The beer garden had atleast 50-70 people and inside there was about 30. No one was wearing masks, you could order your drinks at the bar. It was brilliant.</p>

        <p>I was stoked to go into town on my break at 09:30 and was looking forward to seeing smiling faces everywhere.  </p>
<p>I was hugely disappointed to see about 50% of people IN THE STREET wearing masks!  You are outside!  Wtf!</p>
<p>Contrast this to being on the crowded beach at West Wittering at the weekend and not one mask in sight. </p>
<p>I went into the CoOp. One staff member was maskless, and two other customers as well as myself.  Iâ€™d like to say that was a slight win, but one of the maskless was an old man who had evidently forgotten to pull his up from under his chin.  </p>
<p>But, the more people do away with the theatre props, the more others will follow. They are only acting upon bad information.  </p>
<p>It was good to see two estate agents with maskless workers inside.</p>

        <p>I haven't worn a mask for months and nobody has said anything to me.  Sometimes people will go to sit down near me on a train, notice i am not wearing a mask and they will carry on to a seat a bit further away. Win/win for me.  Shops, trains, busses etc.  All the same.  Stop complying.</p>
