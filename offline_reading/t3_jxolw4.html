    <strong>How quickly would this has gone away if people never started wearing mask?</strong>
    <p><p>How else would you scare 300 million people with something they can’t see? The videos of hospitals overwhelmed were quickly proven wrong when other people went to the hospitals and showed them empty.... when people went to testing sites and there was no one there.. after the news had showed lines for hours...their were not bodies piled up in the streets.. The huge makeshift hospitals they made stayed empty...The only way to get us to continue talking about it and never forget is seeing the mask everywhere you go... what other sign of Covid taking of the world is there??? MASK!</p></p>

        <p>The CDC has never once declared masks as being effective against the spread of influenza.  100 years of the CDC telling people masks are useless in stopping the spread of that virus despite it killing people every single year.  Every year influenza kills more and more people and no one wore masks because everyone KNEW masks wouldn't help.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>BuT wE hAvE a VaCcInE!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And it still kills people every single year.  Sometimes even a hundred thousand in America alone and that's WITHOUT inflating numbers.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden masks are the holy grail of virus protection?  Without even one single explanation as to why they were useless for the last century?</p>
<p>Covid spreads EXACTLY like influenza- even causes the exact same symptoms.  So if anyone wants me to wear a mask, that person is going to have to explain 100 years of error to me first.  I don't think that's too much to ask.</p>

<p>The most important factor that made this "covid" hoax so much more successful than the past ones is the fact that today almost EVERY GODDAMN IDIOT has a smart phone, and media was not alone in spreading rumor and fear. Sheeple did it for them.</p>

        <p>You have a point there. If I did not see people wearing masks everywhere, I would not even know that something was going on in the real world.</p>
<p>My neighbors are still letting their kids play together, no masks necessary.</p>
<p>My neighbors are still going out to malls, Wal-Mart, etc. and a good portion of them refuse to wear the face diapers anymore.</p>
<p>Basically the only thing that makes me even know that this virus existed or exists is that the fricking thing killed my mother and father.</p>
<p>But wait! That was due to the negligence of a rehab center sending Dad home to Mom and I KNOWING that they had CV-19 cases at their rehab center/nursing home without doing a CoVid-19 test.</p>
<p>Something that the Maryland health official was incredulous about when I told them about that when they called and I told them about Dad's death and the circumstances around it.</p>

        <p>I'm still in work, in the UK, and it's what I see daily it's the real world around me. </p>
<p>My journey is way quicker on the empty roads. Spontaneity has gone if I want to pop out for a meal or a drink, I'm in an office of 3 people that usually holds 30, we have to wear masks on site, everywhere even at our desks, an inspector checks at random times through the day and takes out temp. Yes the information is constantly pounding us from screens and radios and posters, there were always part of the world and have changed too.</p>
<p>Things are very different IRL.</p>
<p>Definitely agree on the misery front. It's all just draining, arguing the endless nonsense, seeing the same 'rules' played out over and over and hoping for different results, just giving up arguing the toss as it's draining, folks have given up arguing for or against it, they're just plodding on now as it's easier.</p>

        <p>We have protests and the like here, but they are pointless, it all falls on deaf ears. The control over lockdown in the UK is more to do with businesses not being able to open, and to open freely without restrictions. If they did and other people saw many folks just getting on with it as usual they'd realise it's not the scare story we are led to believe.</p>
<p>Trouble is the business owners, mostly small independent folks would lose their licence, livelihoods and be closed down.</p>
<p>Most civilians would still love to go out, to shop, eat, drink, work - but nowhere is open.</p>

<p>You are getting the wrong people to protest then. Our local sheriffs have made national news coming out against the restrictions. They have vowed not to enforce any of them. The only places that a really at risk are bars since the state could pull their liquor license. Every other business is basically free to do as they wish.</p>

        <p>Right! Revolution, meaning millions of people in the streets demanding our right to be free is the ONLY solution, not vaccines, not testing and certainly not masks. Viruses are a natural part of life and even if we 'licked' this one, which won't happen, there's going to be Covid-21, Hoopla 96 and Ooshibob 500! Are we going to have crazy restrictions and lockdowns forever? Insanity, you know, is doing the same thing over and expecting a different result. Or, in the words of Dr. Phil, "how's that working for 'ya?"</p>

        <p>Empty office blocks and signs on EVERY single shop, some required by law, some posted as additional virtue signaling and streets that are usually full of people are nearly empty.  Not everything is closed (but a lot are) but there are far fewer in the stores and restaurants than should be.  This is the reality up in portland, ME.  At least it makes parking easier when I drive in.</p>

        <p>Maybe on a regional level, but overall not true. I had a 95% normal summer. Bars and restaurants were open and not enforcing mask mandates. We have several large parties (500+ people) just as we normally do all summer. We had maybe 2-3 weeks of a hardcore shutdown where things really did empty out, after that, business as usual. Mask signs on the doors, X's taped to the floors, and everyone ignoring both. I only know 1 person that got covid and he said he's had common colds that were worse.</p>

        <p>Let's say we turned off the media in all forms (tv, internet and papers) all we would see like you've mentioned is people wearing masks and masks being mandatory at stores that we would go to. The hospitals are empty (at normal capacity for this time of year) and we would see testing sites of people testing which is driving up the number of "cases". We would just chalk this year up to it being a bad flu season and nothing more than that honestly. The current narrative that we are being driven is the one we have at hand, the casedemic situation!</p>

        <p>Yes very true - another way to link it to the real world -instead of it only being on a screen- and create panic on top of it is -coincidentally empty stores-. </p>
<p>Which gives another opportunity to blame the victims ("people are so stupid") and mock them - when it really was artificially created (or at the very least deliberately started or increased).</p>

        <p>No, it's declaring healthy people sick, and misleading the public and the authorities by diagnosing people on the basis of pcr positives without any other symptoms. It should be very well known by now that this disease is spread primarily by people with symptoms, symptoms which are well known to the public by now. Mass indiscriminate pcr testing is keeping the fear train going. We don't do this with the flu - we tell people to stay at home if they're displaying symptoms. This, I think, is what 'living with' covid would mean - treating it like any other viral respiratory infection, and not as a special and unprecedented threat.</p>
