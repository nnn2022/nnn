<a href="https://rozenberg.substack.com/p/new-challenge-to-travel-restrictions">https://rozenberg.substack.com/p/new-challenge-to-travel-restrictions</a>  </p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>I am a UK solicitor and businessman with two school-aged children. Upon return from our summer holiday in Croatia we have in simple language been placed under house arrest (now known as quarantine). </p>
<p><strong>My case</strong></p>
<p>Like many other holidaymakers, business people and other travellers, our lives have been significantly affected by this policy. Additionally, many people have been put off travelling and this is destroying the travel industry both here and abroad. Accordingly, we have decided to challenge these regulations. </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>As a result of new government laws that took effect in June 2020, tens of thousands of people visiting or returning to the UK from many countries including EU countries are being subjected to 2 weeks of house arrest.</strong></p>
<p>The Grounds of the judicial review, which set out the legal case in full, are <a href="https://static.crowdjustice.com/case_documents/R+(AB+Others)+v+SoS+-+Grounds+FINAL_Redacted.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What's at stake?</strong></p>
<p>Children are having to miss school and families are unable to return to work. The impacts on daily life both financially and socially are significant. Unlike during ‘lockdown’ which for many was bad enough, these regulations are even more stringent as you are not entitled to exercise outside of your house or flat. My family and I live in a flat and we are not even allowed to step outside for some fresh air. In fact, only one member of the household is allowed to get the shopping.</p>
<p>Many have unquestioningly accepted this state of affairs as the government has misled us to believe that these measures are backed by science. They are not. </p>
<p>People will be stunned to learn that the government has introduced these draconian measures without any scientific studies to back them up. In other words these measures are entirely arbitrary and irrational. As such it is my contention that these laws were passed illegally.</p>
<p>The government has done so on the pretext that it is for our protection. If that is so, one has to query why they have not provided any scientific evidence. On the contrary, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and SAGE have advised against it.</p>
<p>I travel abroad with my family around six times per year which, if these regulations are allowed to continue, would potentially mean having to be under conditions of house arrest for almost a quarter of our lives each year.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Until 2020 house arrest was something reserved for criminals. In a free and democratic society, it is unacceptable for governments to make laws depriving individuals let alone large sections of the population of their fundamental right to liberty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
<p>I would ask all those who feel the same way especially those in the travel industry who have been devastated by these measures to back our legal battle and donate on CrowdJustice.</p>
<p>Our initial target is £10,000 to cover the legal fees of issuing Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court. The total sum needed to progress this complex and important challenge will be many times this. Once the initial target is met, the stretch target will be increased as the case goes on. Substantially more funding will allow me to instruct a solicitors firm and to acquire more resources that will be needed to take on the government in a case of great importance to all travellers and the UK economy</p>
<p>We publish the grounds of appeal above and will publish other court documents and keep the public informed of the key steps in the legal battle.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support!</p>

        <p>Good luck but I won't be donating. I donated to Simon Dolans campaign which was bringing a case against lockdowns and we won't even be getting a hearing for that one and this is absolutely destined for the same fate. </p>
<p>You can't fight against something ingrained within the very system you are trying to use to fight it, you would be better off joining and expanding the protest movement instead, as opposing this will require stepping outside of the law for any progress to be made (and even then, it's 99% likely it will be crushed under foot and end up pointless as well).  Best of luck and I hope you prove me wrong - 10k is a pretty small amount compared to the other campaign so there is a decent chance you'll get that.</p>

        <p>Understood. Hard not to be black-pilled. My friend plays to win, and will certainly not go down without a tenacious fight. I admire him most of all for that, since my instincts are remarkably close to yours.</p>
<p>Something about Dolan - a millionaire, crowdfunding - that never sat right with me.</p>

        <p>You know Simon Dolans campaign is getting a hearing at the Court of Appeal during the week commencing September 28th right? I don't think that legal battle is quite over.</p>
<p>I wouldn't expect Simon Dolan to pay for the entire lawsuit out of pocket. </p>
<p>I respectfully disagree on the protest movement approach. The approach somewhat diminishes the legitimacy of the movement. I believe legal action is the right way to go, and I wish Dolan as well this lawsuit good luck.</p>

        <p>It's just going to be kicked out of the court of appeal, I will be completely shocked if it gets through.</p>
<p>I was never one to distrust someone just because they are successful, I donated a fairly large amount of money to the Dolan campaign and I certainly don't expect him to swallow the entire cost of the case. If the appeal is successful somehow and more money is required I will donate again, I just need to see some sign that the system isn't totally rotten before throwing money into a pit.  Hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised.  I also don't see how legally protesting is deligitimising the case, I mean the main reason as far as I can see that it was thrown out was that 'no jury would rule against the government when the measures taken were for our own safety', well the protest movement shows there are plenty of people who would.</p>

        <p>Well hopefully Dolan can show to the appeals court that the measures were not taken for our own safety, but for optics and political benefit.</p>
