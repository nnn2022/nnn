    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 33/x: No matter how low the Incidence is, the Teachers Association demands at least 3 tests per week and at least 14 days mask mandate after summer break.</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;Teachers' association calls for a "safety phase" after summer vacation<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Association for Education and Upbringing (VBE) is pushing for a "safety phase" after the summer holidays with increased tests and a mask requirement in schools, regardless of the incidence rate. ‚ÄúAt the start of school operations in particular, we have to exercise increased caution. We therefore demand a security phase of at least 14 days after the summer holidays, ‚Äùsaid VBE boss Udo Beckmann to the editorial network in Germany. During this time, more tests must be carried out.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Berlin could serve as a model. According to the information, the capital wants to test students three times in the first week and twice in the second week. In addition, the mask requirement in the building and in class should be reinstated during these two weeks, demanded Beckmann. ‚ÄúOf course this is not the start that we would like. But it is better to be careful than to be left behind - and we have had enough in the last few months. "</p>
<p>At the moment the Incidence in Germany is at 5.7 (no, i did not forget a number. Five Point Seven). And it is still decreasing by at least 30% per week. 38 countys are reporting a Incidence of 0.0</p>
<p>Between the 16 states in Germany, the Incidence varies between 1.8 and 9.9 at the moment. And still the Teachers Association want to torture the kids even more then before. </p>
<p>And remember, it was only 1 week ago, when the Health Minister announced that masks must stay in autumn and winter. It will never end in Germany. Never.</p>

        <p>Teachers were always crying how they love to help kids.
Now, when they have a real chance to rise up and help them, they are cowards.
They are bunch of lazy idiots, who are hiding behind pandemic, so they don‚Äôt have to work.</p>
