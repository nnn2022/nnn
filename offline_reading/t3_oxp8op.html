    <strong>It's interesting that all the vaccinated shut-ins get the virus and we don't</strong>
    <p><p>This honestly really confuses me. I keep seeing all these posts from vaccinated people somehow managing to catch the virus while triple-masked and socially distanced. They even make sure to point out that you can count the number of times they've left their house in the past 18 months on one hand. How is it that all these people who are obsessed with taking precautions and never go outside somehow manage to catch it? My only theory is that they've nuked their immune systems from doing exactly that, and now they're leaving themselves susceptible to stuff even worse than COVID.</p>
<p>I've been going to the gym nearly EVERYDAY since February. I don't wear a mask, and don't bother with social distancing. I also recently got hired as a security guard and I've had LITERALLY THOUSANDS of people come within touching distance of me as they pass by. I'm not wearing a mask and they're not wearing masks.</p>
<p>I've never caught COVID. </p>
<p>According to the doomers I am a living paradox. Is this similar for anyone else?</p></p>

        <p>It’s because the tests are faulty and only doomers get tested.</p>
<p>I had a bad cold this spring and guess what I didn’t do? Get tested. I stayed home and slept it off like I would with any other illness. </p>
<p>Even if it was covid 2.0 (I think I had the original one a long time ago - so I doubt it, it seemed more like a normal cold than when I think I had covid) how would it benefit me to get tested? I didn’t need medical treatment, I was fine, just a weird shitty cold/fever. </p>
<p>It only makes sense to get tested if you’re sick enough to need medical care. Otherwise just stay home and take care of yourself until you feel better.</p>

        <p>Same here. Never been tested and never will be. </p>
<p>My husband had covid, so i almost certainly did too, but we never got tested because we didn't want to add 2 more "cases" to fuel the hysteria. And besides, it didn't fucking matter. I felt nothing, and he had just fatigue, muscle aches, and loss of smell ... for three whole days. We both stayed home for 2 weeks anyway, ya know, just like we'd do if we had the flu. </p>
<p>He caught it from a fully vaccinated person who then tested positive and fell ill, by the way.</p>

<p>That's what my husband said - it was like a mild flu, but "different". Said he could just feel that the thing making him sick was not natural.</p>

        <p>&rt;A really different feeling cold/flu that we recovered from perfectly fine.</p>
<p>I'm convinced at least one student of mine had it in late November or early December of 2019. She had a mild fever and was a bit lethargic and her throat was bothering her, but since both her strep and flu test were negative, her parents sent her to school anyway. By the end of the day she was miserable - she looked like she was coming down with a migraine - and I let her put her head down on her desk and rest for the last period. She didn't come to school the next few days, but was feeling completely fine within a week.</p>
<p>Two days later, the girl in front of her had the same symptoms (also in school  because strep and flu tests were negative), then the next week I had 4 students out with the flu. I'm assuming it wasn't really the flu but flu-like symptoms and parents didn't bother taking them to the doctor.</p>

        <p>They nuked their immune system as you said, by not coming in contact with germs, and putting anti-bacterial cleaners on everything... they also did not get the natural Vitamin D from the sun.  In a lot of the CV deaths, the people had very low levels of vit D.</p>
<p>I took precautions the first 6-8 weeks because I really didn't know what was going on and it was better safe than sorry, but since then, I don't wear masks and live my life like I normally would and have not been sick.  We even hosted a wedding earlier this year, with 100+ people at it - dinner, dancing, drinking, etc.... no one got sick.</p>

        <p>I love it when you go to the doctor and some nurse asks you if you've recently come into contact with somebody with covid.  It's like how the hell should I know since doctors have spent the better part of a year telling us so many covid carriers may have no symptoms.  Is this like a rhetorical philosophical question?</p>

        <p>In the same boat, Since the pandemic started, i never stayed home, i was out as much as i could. I never used sanitizer and washed my hands as little as usual. never used mask unless forced upon me. During all this time I shaked hands and kissed my friends when greeting them. No sign of Covid yet. Maybe i got a very strong immune system. I dont know. I know people who had Covid, but only 2 people who die, both men over 85 with other co-morbidities.</p>

        <p>The vaccines initially result in immune suppression which makes the recipient susceptible to all infections, including Covid. After that there may be a brief period where it gives a small amount of protection but then this wanes. Then antibody-dependant enhancement or pathogenic priming can occur and the person becomes much more susceptible to infection with Covid than if they were unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>I live in central Florida, take what you said and extend back past February to April of 2020. We (myself, my extended family, my kids' homeschool co-op, our friends, our church, our BJJ gym) have been living normally, no masks (except when required which was until about Feb this year for grocery store), no distancing, regular meals and hugs with grandma, daily full contact workout at BJJ with about 40-60 other people, parties, school plays, BJJ tournament in May, restaurant outings since last summer. </p>
<p>A handful of people in that group got sick, isolated themselves for a week while everyone else carried on, then rejoined when they recovered. </p>
<p>I seriously don't know exactly what the people pushing so hard for continued masks, lockdowns, and general disruption of civilization are thinking. What exactly is their explanation for how some people have been living relatively normally for so long without experiencing any of the outcomes they use as scare tactics? See also: Sweden.</p>

        <p>I got the virus (never tested but I had the loss of smell for a week and it was after a party where several others had symptoms and tested positive). Mind you, it took attending anti-lockdown protests, BLM protests, outdoor and underground parties for almost a year before I got it.</p>
<p>As time goes on since the virus first appeared, if you haven't got it yet, you are less and less likely to get it at all. That's what herd immunity is about: as more people gain immunity, they become a buffer zone between the virus and you. The virus tries to spread to me, can't, and dies before I can pass it to you.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is the disease, the Delta varriant.</p>
<p>They ain't even testing for variants. They can't, because they've never even isolated covid. </p>
<p>They just assume anyone who tests positive who is vaccinated has the Delta varriant because they're narrative is that the vaccine only protects against OG covid, not the variants so you need another injection.</p>

        <p>Somewhere, and I can't find it at the moment, I saw a study that the 2003 SARS had given people protection that still exists today. I've wondered if some of us got it back then, possibly asymptomatic, and if that is what is keeping us from catching this. Or maybe we are all doing certain things for our immune systems that others are not. Based purely on comments I've seen on Reddit for years, many of them would not even take a Tylenol for a headache unless they've read 75 peer-reviewed studies and visited a doctor who advised it. So I'd think they'd be quite unlikely to take any supplements or vitamins or improve their diet, get exercise and fresh air, and so on.</p>

        <p>I work in a huge mail sorting facility that employs thousands of people in the NY/NJ metro area. When the pandemic started, we didn’t have masks, hand sanitizer and even enough hand soap and toilet paper. Almost everyone eventually got COVID in my building. In the beginning of the pandemic several people in my facility got really sick. Two died. Yet most of us barely had any symptoms. Fast forward to today, even though we are still required to wear masks, most people wear them under their chin. You have some that wear two masks, a face shield and sanitize everything. However, the majority of us are more relaxed. The one thing I am noticing is the amount of people complaining about adverse reactions from the shot. One coworker got swelling and bleeding in his left eye. BP through the roof. He was out for 5 weeks and now takes off constantly for medical appointments. Another has been out for over a month due to seven blood clots. Personally, I supplement with zinc, quercetin,vitamin d and I eat almost no carbs or sugars. My main foods are nutrient dense like beef, eggs and salmon. I don’t over sanitize. I breath lots of fresh air except for brief periods when I have to mask up to go into a store. Usually the people that go overboard with the masks and hand sanitizers are also the ones eating fast food and drinking sugary sodas. I guess it’s true. When it comes to health, lifestyle choices matter. Also, having a doctor that is open minded and not under the spell of BigPharma is key.</p>

        <p>We may still be getting exposed to the virus daily and developing neutralizing antibodies for it. Isn't that the reason they claim kids are getting that RSV outbreak is because they were shut in forever?</p>
