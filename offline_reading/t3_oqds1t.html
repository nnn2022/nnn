    <strong>Totally alone against the vaccine cult.</strong>
    <p><p>I had already said I was all alone when it comes to vaccine refusal among my circle some days ago, and I am still standing alone.</p>
<p>But today I was confronted about my choice by none other than my grandpa, which I thought was an intelligent and prudent man. Basically, today I met up with the closest members of my family to have dinner and once we were over with it he came right up to me and tried to talk me into taking the vaccine, seeing it as my sister has had it recently and I'm the last member of my family not to take the poison.</p>
<p>I don't even know what he wanted to achieve which such a conversation (as if I were to switch my perspective 180° and suddenly want to vaccinated because he told me I should do so!). He spilled the most bullshit that I have ever heard together, ranging from the usual "trust the science"  to "but every medicine has its side effects". I always kept my tone calm and exposed every single argument I have to back up my position.</p>
<p>I am still young, I just became an adult this year. The last thing I needed to hear from my only remaining grandpa, who I used to hold very dearly until today's event, is "you have disappointed me, I don't understand what you've become".</p>
<p>I learned to shield myself so it doesn't hurt me the slightest. But I find it deppressing that such a situation can ruin familiar bonds just like that . We're meant to be supportive to each other. </p>
<p>This whole conversation with my grandfather just made me realize it's a cult we're dealing with. I don't wish him any bad, but I want my grandfather back, this can't be him.</p>
<p>This sub is my last space to vent because as I said, all my friends and family have succumbed to social pressure and now I'm feeling as lonely as ever, summertime isn't helping as I can't even meet up with many of my friends, which don't even feel like so anymore.</p>
<p>English isn't my first language, excuse any mistakes in my grammar. I'm happy to be here, and I hope everyone has a good day.</p></p>

        <p>I've made peace with the fact that in all likelihood I will never see my grandparents again. They will not allow anyone to visit who isn't vaxxed. They're quite old, and in very poor health (it's amazing how quickly they went from great health to very poor health after getting the vax), and likely won't live long enough to change their minds.</p>
<p>Plus a trip out to visit takes a while to schedule anyway (different city and all that), but it still sucks.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that. I'm lucky mine will see me just " with social distancing and masks till your vaxxed" its quite difficult watching my grandparents and parents are choosing to spend their last years living in fear.

        <p>No you are not.  I know medical doctors who will not touch that thing. Its not some sort of conspiracy but why would I trust a company that will not stand behind its own product. Why would you ask for immunity for liability when your product “ works “. Wait a minute break through infections are happening at the moment.</p>

        <p>I told my grandpa exactly that. Yet he told me I was nuts for believeing there's a higher interest behind all these masa vaccinations and most of doctors taking the vaxx are just following orders or are afraid to speak up. There are people to back every side of the argument wherever you wanna look, but he went as far as to say all doctors agree it's safe. And then I'm the nutjob.</p>

        <p>There was a drug that treated morning sickness. During manufacturing the product was a mirror image of the molecule. It cased birth defects and the company producing it denied it for years. I believe its called Tholidmide. Maybe your grandpa should read about that. I dont blame anyone for not taking the vaccine. If the vaccinated are protected from those without a vaccine why push it. You dont need to vaccinate the entire population this is not some hepatitis B type of virus. They aren’t preventing anything with the vaccine not even infection or death the data is unclear. No one can say the vaccine prevented hospitalisation without considering other factors like age, medical history, asthma and other factors. Throwing a vaccine on it and claiming it work is nonsense. Not how we do science no evidence for that claim considering a large portion of the population been infected.</p>

        <p>Wish everyone could read your comment- it's spot on. Seeing Thalidomide babies still does break my heart. These poor women just trusted their doctors/pharma co.'s/the science and took something for morning sickness- no biggie. Then a whole generation of their kids were born without limbs. It really is horrifying and so sad (google pics if you dare). 
Then there are the pics of picnicking families getting sprayed with clouds of DDT engulfing them while they smile and eat. The chemical affected generations of their children. People need to wake up.</p>

        <p>Yeah I have seen it and seen something even worst recently with anti hypertensive medications. Some medication like ARBs and beta blockers cause cancers. Even SSRI medication like Laxapro cause Afib. Its not an uncommon think that you can treat something and give yourself something even horrible. The justification that some physicians have for is the fact that people will not live long enough to see side effects. The problem with that mindset is some do and get treatment for cancer and then hear that maybe their anti hypertensive gave them cancer. </p>
<p>I know people who were on the medication and end up with cancer then got upset after they found out. Its messed up studies take time and it really matters what type of study you do. Dont tell that to liberals they got this weird belief system that has nothing to do with actually science.</p>

<p>I just replied money isn't buying my safety and it's the same situation playing in the modern day, algo brought up the vax trials end on 2023, but he was very set on his idea and wouldn't listen to me.</p>

        <p>You should also tell him eggs are unhealthy and there are studies out there worded in a way that would make you think they are fine in large qualities. </p>
<p>However a couple of my friends who are practicing physicians in some of the most prestigious hospitals. Say no more than 2 eggs a day. The studies are funded by companies that produce eggs. Cigarette were recommended by doctors back in the day because studies back then didn’t mention long term effects of smoking. Now a days its all over the place that cigarette cause cancer. Who funded these studies cigarette companies did and still do.</p>
<p>Its pay short term and make people buy your product long term.  J &amp; J’s baby powder causes ovarian cancer they are current filing for bankruptcy.</p>

        <p>So I don’t know every countries policies on vaccination liability and compensation but many offer protection against certain legal liability and those that are injured from vaccines are paid out of a vaccine injury fund. I wouldn’t call it immunity but it’s not unique to the Covid-19 vaccines. </p>
<p>I work directly with many doctors. All except one I know are vaccinated. They spent a huge portion of their lives studying medicine. I see anecdotally posts here frequently about he said she said stuff but this sub is very much an echo chamber and it has many conspiracy theorists. It’s okay to have some concerns about the vaccine but i think you might benefit from seeing a doctor and asking him your questions.</p>

        <p>Ok first of all, state-administered injury funds just underline the fact that the manufacturers themselves don't stand behind their product. Second, the amount of time a medical professional has spent in their specific field of expertise does not imbue them with some kind of special knowledge of brand new, insufficiently tested medical technology which even the people producing and selling it are still learning about. Doctors make mistakes all the time, often terrible ones. Medical science is not magic, and it's disturbing to see people accepting such glib assurances from the same people responsible for the opioid epidemic, among other things. Your doctor knows about what they know about, and for everything else they simply defer to the industry status quo. And unless they've been, at a minimum, experimenting with treatments instead of just recommending the vax and tossing people on ventilators, covid is not something your doctor knows about. At all.</p>

        <p>Well if liability was on the pharmaceutical company we would have virtually no vaccines. Jury’s at trial have awarded plaintiffs money from pharmaceutical companies with little to no concrete evidence their product was responsible for injury. So the government created this work around so vaccines can be made. Imagine the tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis vaccine caused colon cancer. Almost everyone in the US has had it. The company would be instantly bankrupt. The risk wouldn’t be worth it and no one would make any vaccines.</p>
<p>And lay persons can’t interpret medical studies accurately. I’m not making fun of anyone but HQC and ivermectin had horrible studies and I see people here talk about them frequently. OP is younger and unless very unhealthy would likely be fine with Covid. I don’t typically care about people’s choices if it doesn’t impact me. But unvaccinated people allow the virus more/better opportunities to mutate into new stronger variants. So misinformation is dangerous to the general public.</p>

        <p>Yes because we should shut everything down when a flu comes around wiping out extremely old people?  This disease didn't drop the average age of death in the USA. Plus I personally know plenty of people that suffered side effects from the vaccine. I know that's anecdotal, but at this point my eyes are all I trust. I don't know anyone that died from Covid. I don't know anyone that knows anyone that died from Covid. Old and morbidly obese dying is not justification for funneling money from small business to Walmart and Jeff Bezos.</p>
