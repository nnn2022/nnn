        <p>He described having coronavirus As “definitely the roughest I’ve felt from any illness in my adult life”. And went on to thank scientists who made the vaccines because without it he believes his fate would have been far worse and says the vaccines saved his life. </p>
<p>This is the script now as these ‘rare breakout infections’ become not so rare ..</p>

        <p>HAHAHAHA. Buddy. My GF and I had covid. Spent one day taking naps and feeling a bit warm. She had some sniffles, I didnt. Next day a little groggy but otherwise fine again. Third day we were doing home workouts again. But maybe your obese ass should be more scared about it.</p>

        <p>I have no fight in this &amp; I tend to look at both sides but seeing as how the CDC itself keeps backtracking every-time they “recommend” something is quite alarming; to call itself “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention” they are doing a pretty terrible job at it.</p>
<ol>
<li>It was everyone needs to mask &amp; social distance</li>
</ol>
<p>2.then it was “vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks”</p>
<p>3.it’s then announced that they might need a 3rd dose</p>
<p>4.we have gone full circle back to being told we need to wear masks whether vaccinated or not</p>
<p>As I said I have no fight in this nor am I subbed to this specific subreddit (Yes I did get vaccinated) but I won’t shove that decision down anyone’s throat.</p>
<p>IMO governments all over failed people miserably &amp; caused others to pay the price for it.</p>
<p>I see the argument for getting vaccinated falling apart more and more everyday.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with the vaccinations is that you can’t sue the companies that made them if they cause injury or side effects &amp; most importantly if a person dies from said vaccine; guess what you can’t hold them responsible. Below is what another user comments in a different post.</p>

<p>Interview with Dr. McCullough on how the illogical government response makes him believe they wanted to make things worse so they could use the situation to push vaccines to acquire more power and control (honestly the video makes him sound like a bit of a nut, but the world has gone so nutty in the past few years that maybe the one-eyed man is king and the guy is extremely well credentialed and he makes sense, so I think the video is worth a listen): https://www.bitchute dot com/video/dJDl0QUDbiLA/</p>

        <p>wishing death upon someone vaccinated or unvaccinated is completely idiotic. I find you rude and quite frankly completely disrespectful. Science is important and most of these people here are skeptical for good reason. I have had all my prior vaccinations and I have even had the flu vaccine a couple of times, but this is a completely rushed and abnormal vaccine. If you want to attack people personally and wish death upon them, then maybe you should talk to a therapist.</p>

        <p>He tested positive for the virus. 
The bs PCR test merely indicates there are traces of the virus in your system. That’s all. Testing positive for the virus isn’t equal to having Covid19.  You can be quadruple vaccinated but if you come in contact with the virus then you can still test positive. I wish we could all understand the difference between the virus and the illness, between testing positive and actually being ill with covid.</p>

        <p>And I wish people would understand why these imperfect vaccines are so dangerous.</p>
<p>And alot of people seem to believe that getting the shot will stop transmission. You yourself just admitted that it doesnt. Anyone who understands how the vaccine works knows that it doesnt block transmission but only limits symptoms.</p>
<p>Natural immunity LIKELY does stop all transmission and infections, like its supposed to. We should not let imperfect vaccines like this be used on a mass scale because it will likely create variants that will kill the unvaccinated since they are not protected from the symptoms. Can't you see? That was their entire goal with this man made virus.</p>
<p>They want anyone who doesnt take the shot, to die and you people are gleefully dancing around the corpses.</p>

        <p>&rt; Sir Patrick said: "Vaccines are not 100% effective. They're very very effective, but not 100%</p>
<p>They're very very effective, but not 100%. Source? My ass. </p>
<p>More like 1.3% effectiveness. The ~70% immunity is bullshit as per usual. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2666-5247%2821%2900069-0">Source: The Lancet</a></p>
<p>&rt;"As a higher proportion of the population is double vaccinated, it's inevitable that those 10% of that very large number remain at risk and will therefore be amongst the people who both catch the infection and end up in hospital."</p>
<p>10%? Source? My ass. </p>
<p>100% of the vaccinated no matter the amount of times they were injected are at risk of catching and spreading it.</p>
