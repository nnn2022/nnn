        <p>The younger generation has been successfully brainwashed. The two craziest thing I've noticed is they all fight over victimization points and they completely trust the government and media.</p>
<p>Both these happen in other generations too but definitely the younger the more extreme. For example, I see more young people at my gym wearing masks than old people.</p>

        <p>I sort of think younger people have always been this way, it's just that the media messaging changed. 60's and 70's pop culture encouraged "rebellion" in a way that wasn't actual rebellion, and kids took that to heart. Now they just don't encourage it at all and push woke stuff that kids follow.</p>

<p>Not a single mask outside of employees annnnd the one early 20-somethings couple who we watched take their masks down to eat and put them back up when they were chewing.</p>

        <p>I mean like holy shit, they didn't even offer a moment of brainpower to think that one through did they? lmao.</p>
<p>Anyone with a damn brain would instantly know 'hey, if my parent who's paying for everything leaves to go to jail, how will I continue living here with no job and no income?'</p>
<p>It's like they think she'll go to jail and they'll have instant access to their savings or something like that along with all the government support to keep the house going along with all bills. What a fucking childish way of looking at something, and in their early 20s no less.</p>
<p>That dude is a massive idiot and will prolly go no where in life ever. Prolly another one that will look around one day and realize they're 40 and have accomplished nothing along with having no offspring either...</p>

        <p>Jesus. I remember I moved out when I was 18 just so I could live in my piece of shit car so that I had a shorter commute to work. These kids are pampered and some of these parents have failed them to a pathetic degree. Imagine being so disconnected from reality that you would turn on your own blood for regular human behavior.

I don't even know what I'm going to do for the rest of my life. I really hope most people around my age are not like this guy. I'm not sure whether to be ashamed or remorseful of my generation.</p>

Kids will get parents fined or arrested and parents will even sell out their own children.  This has been proven time and again by history.  I don't talk to doomers.

        <p>A few months ago I read a girl denied her mother's pleads for a visit, tickets were cheap to fly and see her she's having a really hard time. Daughter wouldnt do it, couldn't risk getting someone sick. Mom killed herself. Daughter said she's sad but she'd do it again because she wouldnt want to infect anyone at the airport etc. Most heartless thing I'd ever read on here.

"Sanitation, expiration date? Question everything Or bow-down and be a victim of authority!" runs through my mind all day!  I was born and lived before the internet.  We lived, we learned.  If you were a pussy, you got your ass beat till you figured it out.  But then the Soy Boy generation came.. And now you do what they told ya.. Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!  Punk Rock, Alternative Rock,  Death Metal,  and Gangster Rap was truly necessary for me to be Woke in a world FULL of sheep!  How does the world produce guys like this!?  He is willing to Rat 🐀 out his mother for "the greater good"?  He truly is a victim of his shitty ass environment.  I worry for the future!</p>
