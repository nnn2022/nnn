    <strong>(Genuine) question from an outsider regarding public health &amp; safety mandates</strong>
    <p><p>(I'm not completely sure if this is allowed, so by all means remove if not) </p>
<p>I'm a pretty strict rule follower when it comes to covid regulations (I think it's the right thing to do, I probably don't have reasons you haven't heard before). Admittedly, I commented here yesterday in a douche-y manner (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/m5soik/im_sick_of_the_cdcfauci_bullshit/gr3628k/?context=3">here</a>) mostly just to be a dick, but the premise of it made me want to pick your guys' brains a bit about government overreach and pre-covid public safety rules. </p>
<p>I ask in good faith and out of genuine curiosity (and with an apology for trying to annoy everybody here yesterday), and I'm hoping to gain some insight. </p>
<p>- Is "public health" or "public safety" ever a good justification for creating and enforcing rules and regulations? If so, how do we discern what public safety risks are worth making rules for? If not, what public safety rules do you think go too far (covid rules aside)? </p>
<p>- We follow a ton of public health and safety rules in our everyday lives. For example, say you want to go out to a restaurant: </p>
<ul>
<li>When you drive to the restaurant, you follow public safety rules on the road </li>
<li>You aren't allowed to drive until you have a license proving you understand how to drive safely  </li>
<li>You have to get your car inspected (a car that had to be built to certain safety standards) </li>
<li>You have to follow the speed limit, stop at traffic lights/stop signs, and use your turn signal-- failure to do so can result in consequences </li>
<li>When you get there, you walk into a building that wouldn't be allowed to open without public safety measures </li>
<li>The building had to be built to code </li>
<li>The building has to have fire/emergency escapes in it </li>
<li>When you order food, there are measures taken so it's safe to eat </li>
<li>The employees have to wash their hands and wear a hairnet </li>
<li>The food has to be stored at the correct temperature </li>
<li>The food can't be unsafe or expired </li>
<li>Contaminated food is supposed to be disposed of </li>
<li>If applicable, you may not be allowed to smoke within a certain radius of the building </li>
<li>The restaurant has to undergo inspection to make sure public health rules are complied with, and if those rules are not complied with, there are consequences </li>
<li>The food products they purchase are bought from places that also follow public health rules-- i.e., meat or poultry has to be produced to a certain standard, in many states milk can only be sold if it's pasteurized </li>
</ul>
<p>Do you support these public health and safety rules being enforced? If so, what makes them different from mask/social distancing rules? If not, why? Did you ever push back? </p>
<p>- Who did we listen to for guidance when these (and other) public health rules were created? </p>
<p>- I often hear that, should we stop adhering to covid mandates, that those who do not feel safe going out due to fear of catching covid should remain at home. Can this be applied to other public health laws? For example-- should it be optional to follow traffic laws, and those who do not feel comfortable driving should stay home? Should it be optional for cooks to prepare food safely, and those who do not feel safe eating out should refrain from doing so? Should it be optional to have fire escapes in buildings, and those who fear getting caught in a fire should refrain from entering buildings? </p>
<p>I don't intend for these to sound snarky, I'm just trying to understand what it is about covid public health mandates that grinds people's gears more than the public health rules we already have to follow. </p>
<p>Bonus question: did you discover any hidden pros to mask wearing? Personally, I gotta say I love the extra nose warmth in winter (the price is foggy glasses though)</p></p>

        <p>But isn't it, in some ways? Redundant example, but if you buy milk at the grocery store, you expect a few things: it's not being sold to you expired, the expiration date is readily available to you, and it's been pasteurized. The reason they mandated pasteurization is because the bacteria in raw milk can make you seriously ill. In fact, not only is it illegal to buy and sell raw milk in some states, but there's a federal law preventing dairies from distributing milk across state lines if it's packaged for consumption (meaning, you're only allowed to ship raw milk across state lines if it's going somewhere for pasteurization or for cheese making). </p>
<p>Theoretically, you could look out for your own health by not buying raw milk. But if I was a dairy farmer who had absolutely 0 responsibility for your health, should I be allowed to sell you unpasteurized milk and not inform you? </p>
<p>If I was a cook preparing your meal at a restaurant, would it be acceptable for me to use expired food that fell on the floor? If I have no responsibility towards your health whatsoever, why are there mandates preventing me from doing this?</p>

        <p>No. I know when milk is spoiled, because I smell it. It’s my fault if I get sick.</p>
<p>No. If I’m served spoiled food at a restaurant, I took my own risk eating something prepared by a stranger behind closed doors. What’s to keep you from doing that is keeping your business in good standing.</p>
<p>I’ll say it again, my personal health is no one else’s responsibility, no matter how much the government or my peers try to interfere.</p>

        <p>I drink raw milk regularly it is better for your stomach once you get used to it and the taste is better but that isn't relevant. </p>
<p>The idea that you would use dairy, specifically processing, I find funny. The processors in the dairy industry who have been propped up by combursome regulations have driven dairy farms to poverty. Dairy farms dont make any money and a lot of family farms are going out of business becuase of bad regulations defending practices that hurt individuals.</p>
<p>The laws you are advocating for are propped up by lobbyists, I suppose that is who you want making our laws becuase they are always right or are featured in the news?</p>

        <p>Public health measures are fine if: </p>
<p>They make sense</p>
<p>They are supported by data</p>
<p>The have broad general support by the people</p>
<p>A year ago, while I was skeptical of the actions being taken, I don't think they were necessarily ridiculous. Based on the limited data we had at the time, there was some logic to imposing temporary lockdowns to help  "flatten the curve" so as not to overwhelm healthcare systems. Even though we didn't have a lot of data, there was probably enough to merit taking things seriously. And at that point I think most people were somewhat on board, or at least not opposed to what was being done. </p>
<p>But this mentality was only somewhat valid for about 1 month last March. After that, what was being done didn't make sense, wasn't supported by the data and there were enormous segments of the population that were completely ignored and forced to comply with things they adamantly did not agree with. </p>
<p>Today lockdowns, masks and other restrictions simply don't make sense. It's a total exercise in futility and arrogance. They have not proven to be effective at what they were promised to do, and to still think they will eventually "work" if people would just "do it right", is absurd. Lockdowns and masks did nothing to stop the initial outbreak last spring, and did nothing to stop the outbreak last fall. And the idea that we can control an endemic, highly contagious, airborne, respiratory virus through government mandates makes no sense at all. Maybe on a theoretical, individual basis, in a lab or computer model, there is logic to lockdowns and masks to slow viral spread, but as long term public policy that requires actual humans everywhere to comply at extremely high levels with unprecedented requirements that have tremendous costs, is absolutely insane. There is a reason why lockdowns and masks have never been recommended (let alone mandated) before, even though there have been plenty of global pandemics over the last 50 years. There is a reason why the CDC, WHO, Fauci and every public health expert prior to 2020 advised against lockdowns and masks. Lockdowns MAKE NO SENSE. And now the numbers completely destroy any notion that lockdowns and masks work. There is no correlation between restrictions and good covid numbers. None whatsoever. The actual results from actual government mandated lockdowns and mask wearing in the actual real world for the last year clearly show that they don't work. They don't stop or slow the spread of sars-cov-2. They just don't. And when places decide to loosen restrictions, there is no increase in spread. And in the end, at this point, lockdowns and masks are opposed by too many people to justify ignoring their opinions and implementing them regardless. It would be one thing if opposing lockdowns and masks was some fringe position held by a small group of extremists, but that's not the case. It's a mainstream position and ignoring it is not justified.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Every restriction has been imposed in the name of "science", but they've all been implemented in the most unscientific ways imaginable. Rules are set with no end conditions, no control group, no consistent tracking or monitoring, no enforcement, no definition of terms, etc. They are arbitrarily set, expanded, changed, loosened, and constantly meddled with. It's a joke.</p>

<p>Yes. How we know is that the rules do more good than harm, unlike the dystopian covid rules that ruin lives. The rules you listed harm no one.</p>
<p>"Do you support these public health and safety rules being enforced? If so, what makes them different from mask/social distancing rules? If not, why? Did you ever push back?"</p>
<p>Sure. Like I said already, what makes them different is that they don't do more harm than good and actually they are proven to work. Loads of covid rules are not scientifically proven to do anything nor do they make common sense. One example is putting on your mask to enter the restaurant and taking it off when you sit down.</p>
<p>"I often hear that, should we stop adhering to covid mandates, that those who do not feel safe going out due to fear of catching covid should remain at home. Can this be applied to other public health laws? For example-- should it be optional to follow traffic laws, and those who do not feel comfortable driving should stay home? Should it be optional for cooks to prepare food safely, and those who do not feel safe eating out should refrain from doing so? Should it be optional to have fire escapes in buildings, and those who fear getting caught in a fire should refrain from entering buildings?"</p>
<p>Again, the difference is in the harm the measures do. Following traffic laws etc. doesn't cause people to become depressed and suicidal or to lose their jobs, homes, business and become destitute. So no, following those rules should not be optional. Watching your business that you worked for years or even decades go under in front of your eyes so you could maybe give 90 year old Doris an extra 6 months to live should be optional.</p>
<p>"Bonus question: did you discover any hidden pros to mask wearing? Personally, I gotta say I love the extra nose warmth in winter (the price is foggy glasses though)"</p>
<p>I don't wear one.</p>

        <p>my right to drive an automobile is nowhere in the constitution. the government may tell me when where and how to drive. they can tell me that I cant drive ever again!!  i wish I had a right to drive in the constitution, but alas, I don’t. 
I have no right to a building in the constitution. If I own one, i have to submit to the regulations that are in place tho. most of these regulations have been in place for a long time too. I wish the constitution said I have a right to a building. Then I could do whatever I liked with it. 
food. This is what we call regulation. None of the regulations on the food industry violate my rights in the constitution. It sucks for the restaurants, but the gov can regulate food all they want, and I have no right to eat in the constitution. I wish it said in the constitution that I have a right to food. 
I don’t necessarily support all of these regulations, but I accept that most of them have been voted into law over time, and i know that they are for safety bc they have a proven track record. 
A good example of guidance in auto regulations is ralph Nader. Hes why we have seatbelts and such. Of course, the establishment tried to silence him, but he won. 
Again with driving. There are rules of the road that we all follow. If you dont want to follow the rules, you can stay off the road. Or stay home, or walk, or take a bus, or a train, drive with a friend, etc.
They grind my gears bc they violate my right to assemble and are not laws. 
Hidden bonus to wearing mask is having an excuse for not stopping and talking with people who u recognize.</p>

        <p>(One counter point) Car Inspections - laws vary by state and a state cannot enforce another states inspection requirements. If you never want to inspect a car register it in Michigan. I register my cars in Rhode Island and never drive there so no I don't get my car inspected becuase fundamentally I disagree with the need for it. In my opinion it doesn't effect safety, like in MA if you have visible rust it fails. That is bullshit I drive a beat up work truck paint chips and it rusts. Visible rust isn't a safety issue and when I drive, people dont accuse me of hurting others becuase I decide to opt out of a stupid system.</p>
<p>To answer you in the general these regulations are not backed up by scientific consensus and the pandemic is being used to push a narrative counter to our individual liberties. If a mask mandate or vaccination requirement is actually the will of the people create it through the legislature not the will of dictatorial edicts. Everyday you comply with a law you morally object to you sacrifice your freedoms and when laws are not passed through the legislature you sacrifice your representation giving up the only thing that matters. Liberty or death blah blah blah lol</p>
<p>If all of these regulations and mandates are so important and so accepted why are they being enacted through executive action? Why don't your representatives legislate the requirements? Why can't anyone dissent without being destroyed publicly and personally?</p>

        <p>You are getting rules and laws confused. The examples you have stated above ( driving, food safety, fire escapes etc.) have LAWS in place to protect the public. Yes, they should be enforced , they are laws. As a society we have laws and agree that we give a certain amount of personal freedom to protect the public from bad actors. These laws are not the same as the “health mandates “ . Mandates are not laws. The current covid rules are not laws. To act as such (by theses stores or any business) is a direct violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title II. Therefore the enforcement (denied entry, harassment ,etc.)of such mandates are unlawful.</p>
