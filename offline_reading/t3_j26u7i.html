    <strong>Ignoring The Obvious</strong>
    <p><p>So here we are. Some of us have not been wearing masks since the onset of the "recommendations" and mandates. Are you dead yet? Did you kill your grandma with your filthy diseased breath? This begs another question, how can they still go on making these claims when the DIRECT evidence in front of them says opposite of the MSM/doomer message?</p>
<p>I told my wife yesterday I can feel there is little to no need to argue our perspective at this point. The painfully obvious is about to arrive. Also, if we're as stupid and obtuse as they claim why do they feel the need to send the brigade to silence us?</p>
<p>They may feel like we're winning but for me I have no desire to win. I only want the truth. The truth doesn't need likes, upvotes, awards, or accolades it stands on it's own. Sure it takes it's sweet time, but when it arrives no lie can stand against it. My advice? Sit back....grab your tea...and Kermit the frog outta this bitch.</p></p>

        <p>I do admit, this virus IS somewhat like the flu. A much, much more dangerous virus than the flu, but the symptoms are similar. However, you have no way of knowing if you're sick or not unless you get tested. Better safe than sorry. Also, this virus literally can travel through thin air. That's why social distancing guidelines exist.</p>
<p>Yes, it's like the flu. But it's about 1000 times more dangerous than the flu.</p>

<p>It's not "a thousand times more dangerous", especially if you even admit you don't know you have it unless you're tested.</p>

        <p>I'd ask how many flu deaths there were this month, but it isn't flu season so it wouldn't really work. The flu is far less contagious and has a lower mortality rate than COVID-19. It's just better to do whatever possible to slow the spread, even if that does mean leaving the house as little as possible and wearing masks. Even if you don't show symptoms, it is very possible that you still have the virus. As I said, better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>OBVIOUSLY the 1000 times more dangerous thing was an exaggeration. How is it that you can't understand hyperbole?</p>

        <p>The rona is only deadlier than the flu in elderly/infirm individuals. Otherwise, the mortality rate is equal to - if not lower than - the flu. More contagious viruses are often less deadly. If COVID was allowed to spread to young healthy people, it would most likely become just another seasonal common cold.</p>

<p>I am pretty old, and this is the most bizarre thing I have ever seen. Every little corner of dissent must be trod upon. I am beginning to suspect some kind of mind control is at work. It is just too depressing to think that most people are this dumb.</p>

        <p>Reddit is a heavily shilled place. I think there are armies of people (or bots) that search whole reddit by specific keywords and downvote or comment on threads they disagree with (or are paid to disagree with).</p>
<p>Lately I have started to avoid naming hot-button topics directly. For example I try to not use the name of current virus directly, but refer to it as just 'a virus' or similar.</p>

        <p>It's very frustrating to deal with these types, not just because they're annoying, but because they are getting in the way of progress in reversing this hellscape. I agree, it is not worth the time arguing with them. It won't do any good because they don't even try to understand our perspective, as they don't want to because they are philistines. </p>
<p>I only created a reddit to connect with likeminded people to help me stay sane. I don't give a damn about likes or upvotes. I find the whole brigade thing rather silly, but now I understand why people criticize reddit.</p>
<p>I just hope they don't "win" in the real world because if they win, government overreach will get even worse. And the same people bitching about us now will be sorry later on when tyranny prevails.</p>

        <p>I’d normally like to say that sucks and hope she gets better. I find it weird you’ve never mentioned this and continue to post on The Office and PcMasterRace while your mother is on a ventilator in a hospital.</p>
<p>Not gonna call BS but seems suspect to me</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Person said his no mask brother got covid at a car show and gave it to his no mask mother and she’s now on a vent. He deleted the post instead of just calling me out so that’s that I guess.</p>
<p>When you want to prove you’re the moral one, I’d think you’d post the truth and not lie. I mean why would you have to right?</p>
<p>If that is a true story. I hope all the best to you and your future PC purchases and I also hope you enjoy the new Office reboot</p>

        <p>What is your DIRECT experience with COVID? Was it as bad as they said? Did 10 people you know get infected? Was it more? Was it less but a close family member? Two? Out of the 200 or so people I know 3 had it. Only one was severe and they lived. I haven't seen them since before the "pandemic". If I were a possible spreader I would have been contacted by now by contact tracers. That is unless the system in place isn't very effective which would suggest that this indeed isn't as bad as they say due to the low death rate in consideration of the US's large population. You can do the math on percentages of 200,000 out 300 plus million.</p>

        <p>I listen to scientist as well. It's when they contradict themselves repeatedly and proceed to advise the government to implement questionable mandates is when I have a problem. Especially when those mandates do nothing to combat the "spread" and end up destroying the very fabric of human interaction and cause mass paranoia as you've demonstrated above. I don't have a 1/6 chance of catching covid by the way so comparing me going about my day in a normal fashion to Russian roulette is illogical. I'm sure you'll be hearing from u/RandomJew567 about your false equivalency...at least you should if he is even remotely consistent with him having no official position and all....</p>

        <p>I mean, it's less of a logical fallacy and more of a figure of speech. You'll find that, on this sub, people do tend to hold the beliefs of something along the lines of "I'm not scared of the virus, so i'll risk it". While it's obviously an exaggeration to claim that doing so is Russian Roulette, the comparison is there, that being to risk your life on a low percentage chance of death.  </p>

        <p>For one, I haven't taken a perspective on the mask argument or anything. All I did was point out that your post lacked logical reasoning. I didn't even claim that your statements were incorrect, all i've done is showcase that they were ascertained with a highly improper methodology. You really can't deny that it's something of a stretch to associate what i've done so far with the quote that you listed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you're saying that the pro-mask equivalent to your argument would be the quote you listed? Sure, maybe, and I'd disagree with the logical throughline of that quote for similar reasons as well. Hypocrisy on both sides doesn't make you correct.</p>

        <p>Interesting your logical mind can't see the absurdity of your initial question which is pulling something entirely different from what was said and the fact that it was meant to be taken literally. </p>
<p>The only reason I mentioned the pro mask equivalent is to show the polarity of that type of thinking and that despite being on the other end of the spectrum they're identical in their emotional reasoning which they put in place of logic. I'm glad you're able to at least gather that much between the two, kudos. </p>
<p>Equally amazing is coming on to thread to point out improper methodology while multiple governments and health agencies have implemented measures that fit the very definition of that. You really can't make this shit up....</p>

You stated that that the “obvious” evidence that refuted the opposite side of your perspective was that you didn’t wear masks, and you and your grandmother weren’t dead.

&rt;Here is LITERALLY what I said: "Are <strong><em>you</em></strong> dead yet? Did you kill <strong><em>your grandma</em></strong> with your filthy diseased breath?"<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I said nothing about my own grandmothers, both of which were dead before I was born. I asked if any of the people who are against mask mandates (those that wear them but are against them and those who refuse to wear them at all and all in between) are <strong><em>they</em></strong> dead yet. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I've refuted the other sides stance on the issue repeatedly in various posts with pro mask articles and studies that say they <strong><em>believe</em></strong> mask works but the efficacy is <strong><em>marginal</em></strong> at best and no difference at worst, and that more study is needed.  They always say the same thing, findings <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> they work but there is still an ongoing debate on the issue due to varying participation, the low quality of test, and the fact that what is done in the lab cannot be replicated in the real world due to unexpected variables. Again, take what you will from my statement since I have no control over the hamster that turns the wheel in your mind.</p>

        <p>You're partially correct. I misspoke, I was just restating the specific way the you phrased your original post, that being "you and your". I do apologize for the confusion caused, however, it really doesn't change the fallacious nature of your argument.</p>
<p>To elaborate even further, you were saying, rhetorically to your audience, that since somebody's not dead, and their grandparents weren't killed by corona, it's obvious that corona's being overblown. This is still a terrible argument, it's citing hypothetical evidence and drawing an unsubstantiated conclusion, but I digress.</p>
<p>My point is essentially questioning as to why you'd cite or mention that in the first place. In your original post, you even described it as direct evidence.</p>
<p>From there, you seem to be backpedaling, I asked you (albeit incorrectly) if that was your argument, which for all intents and purposes, it was, and you responded by saying that the pro-mask crowd makes similar arguments. Whether or not they do is entirely irrelevant, as it's faulty either way.</p>
<p>You go on to say that you were just highlighting the other sides' polarity in their thinking, which for one, isn't really relevant, as you were the one that made that argument, not "them", and it's pretty clear that this post wasn't just satirizing the arguments made by the other side or something.</p>
<p>Then, last comment, you (correctly) rectified my understanding of the situation, and pointed out my misunderstanding, however, you're still yet to refute why you made the faulty argument in the first place. That's all I'm debating here. </p>
<p>Sure, pro-maskers don't have consistent beliefs, sure, there's tons of articles refuting their viewpoints, sure, the test sucks and is useless, sure their projections can't be applied to the real world. None of that's relevant. </p>
<p>All I'm questioning is the validity of that argument in your first post. We seem to be getting a bit off topic, so again, how is your original argument valid?</p>

&rt;<br>
&rt;200,000 dead after <strong><em>models</em></strong> initially predicted 2 million by this point. I would say that fits the description of overblown. Whether that was due to over reliance on predictive models or human error alone is debatable but the result is "they" were undeniably wrong in comparison.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"My point is essentially questioning as to why you'd cite or mention that in the first place. In your original post, you even described it as direct evidence."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The direct evidence I'm referring to is admittedly anecdotal, though I would argue ALL evidence is anecdotal due to someone having to personally witness it and record it but I digress, but is still far removed from people's predictions I would quickly succumb to infection if I didn't wear a mask or that I am putting anyone else in danger without ascertaining my personal hygienic practices. No they assume I'm a filthy dirty human who is obviously inconsiderate, hence the tongue in cheek question, "are you dead yet?" Maybe you didn't take it as satire but that was the intent. The main point of the post was it <strong>WILL</strong> be clear to some soon on the other side of this debate that a). the mask are meant to be permanent b). that this hardly had anything to do with preserving the publics health but to break the publics sense of community and to slowly erode any ideas of individuality or resistance.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Perfect anecdotal experience was what happened to me this weekend. I went to the supermarket to pick up a couple of things and saw a woman in a blue dress with an a attractive figure. She stood out for some reason. I walked right by her without making eye contact nor did she attempt to make eye contact with me or ANYONE. Everyone stares straight ahead at the supermarket now who wears a mask and avoid eye contact frequently. I paid for my 2 items and leave. Pull into my apartment complex and park and see my neighbor do the same. Lo and behold it was her and it hit me like a ton of bricks what mask end up doing to the communal psyche, it absolutely obliterates it.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Now, you can take whatever you want from this discussion but understand this, the emotion on this subject for me is completely removed just as the emotion on a debate over whether the sun will rise in the east tomorrow would be. I <strong>KNOW</strong> where this is going and mask are only the first step. Ignore at your own peril.....</p>

        <p>If you had substantiated your original post with "the models predicted 2 million", and then linked those models, I would have absolutely no issue with your post.</p>
<p>Instead, you basically cited "You and your grandmother aren't dead" as evidence that Corona's overblown. This is my issue with your post. That is objectively terrible evidence.</p>
<p>I don't care to debate  the topic of masks, I haven't attempted to do that.
The reason why I'm still responding, is because you're yet to admit that your original argument was a mistake or attempted to defend it properly.</p>
<p>If it was satire, it was poorly made satire, as nobody in the comments understood that. I didn't, the other people against your argument didn't, and the people supporting your argument didn't either.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, you guys are being brigaded hard, I obviously don't support stuff like that. I'm generally against most viewpoints that are held here, but people just spamming threads with "You're an idiot" and mass downvoting only helps propagate the whole "red-pilled" concept. I tend not to respond to brigadiers, because for one, they oftentimes get immediately banned, and that doesn't really leave any room for discussion, or no argument is even made in the first place. Take this thread as an example; pretty much everybody who was downvoted besides me had their comments deleted, presumably, because they were being unreasonable.</p>
<p>&rt;"I've got a nice cup of peppermint right now. Let the incoherent flailing, cheap insults, and outright lies begin."</p>
<p>This seems to be more so just referring to how you phrased your post and how the sub is being brigaded rather than the actual content within it. You titled it "Ignoring The Obvious", which, while I don't have a problem with it, does tend to frustrate people who have different beliefs than you, no matter the argument inside.</p>
<p>&rt;"I'm not dead yet and my grandmas already were, so I'm good."</p>
<p>Sure, it's humorous and phrased like your post is, but it's agreeing with the supposedly satirical sentiment in your post, albeit in a humorous manner. At best, it's ambiguous as to what it's actually supporting.</p>
<p>Just another thing, when another guy in the thread, u/glix1, didn't feel as though you made a proper argument, you didn't say that the argument was satirical and was meant to poke holes in the opposing perspective. Not only is that another person who missed the fact that this is supposedly satire, but you go on to defend the supposedly satirical ideas with legitimate, albeit rather flawed, logical reasoning, with quotes like:</p>
<p>&rt;"What is your DIRECT experience with COVID? Was it as bad as they said?</p>
<p>This isn't indicative of a satirical post. This just defends the anecdotal rhetoric used in your original flawed argument.</p>

        <p>Smh, how about I send you a rough draft of my next post so not to cause further confusion? I'll outline every sentence with its emotional intent in parentheses and wait for your approval. Will that make you happy?</p>
<p>And for the record there is no requirement for me to remain satirical in the comment section of MY post. If I want to change up the tone it is my prerogative. I don't care if the other guy or you felt I made the proper argument especially since you have no stake in the matter which makes your input that much more questionable. Why are you here? If you don't have an official position why comment at all? I think you're trying to show off your intellect but instead you come off as annoying. My advice is lighten up and quit taking yourself so seriously.</p>

        <p>Why do you keep brining up emotional intent? As far as I can tell, neither of us have cited anything of that regard in terms of our direct argumentation. That's never been what my issue with your post was. If you'd like for me to proofread your posts in the future, then by all means, PM them to me.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure that you fully understand what you've claimed your post to be. You used the flawed argument of roughly "Neither you nor your grandmother are dead, therefore Corona is overblown". I questioned you about this, and you claimed that you were satirizing the pro-mask side's argument about something along the lines of "My grandmother has Covid, therefore everybody's grandmother will die".</p>
<p>This, alone, is fine. Sure, you made a purposefully bad argument to poke fun at the other side. I don't personally find it satirical or anything as people in this sub do legitimately use that argument, but I can understand that an attempt at satire was made.</p>
<p>Where that idea begins to fall apart, however, is how, in responding to somebody's comment, you started to defend the whole "direct evidence" idea, and explain the rhetoric behind its validity. That's not satire. That's how you debunk satire. </p>
<p>Here's an example of a satirical post you might find on a pro-mask subreddit:</p>
<p>"You guys are such SHEEP!!! Reading studies and being educated, SMH my head. On my favorite subreddit, r/nonewnormal, we don't care about all of those big pharma SHILLS!!! Instead, I choose to inject ESSENTIAL OILS like a #BOSSBABE!!!.</p>
<p>Regardless of your opinions on the topic, even if you agree with everything that was said satirical, which I hope you don't, you should still accept that it works as an effective satire. That person clearly doesn't hold those perspectives, and is instead poking fun at people who do.</p>
<p>If somebody in the comments said, "Actually, you need to use essential oils for aromatherapy, not injection", that creator of the satirical post doesn't respond with journal articles and arguments that defend the usage of injecting essential oils, they downvote the comment, and respond with "r/wooosh" .</p>
<p>You did the former. Instead of responding to either of your critics, who supposedly missed the joke, by telling them it was satire, you started to try and make legitimate arguments  that defend the usage of the flawed argument. That's the <em>opposite</em> of what your satire was supposedly trying to accomplish. If the other side to your perspective, the pro mask side, was making arguments like that, all you've done by defending your post like that was make validation towards their argument. If your goal was legitimately to satirize that argument, you responding like that was entirely counterproductive.</p>
<p>As to why I'm here, mainly because I enjoy argumentation. I saw that you made a bad argument, so I called that out to try and start a discussion. You continued to make contradictory statements to try and defend or excuse yourself from that argument, so I argued against that, and showcased why your perspective was wrong. I enjoy that, it's entertaining for me. If it's not for you, then that's fine, you're not obligated to respond.</p>
<p>I'm not attempting to brag about how intelligent I am or take myself too seriously. I treated your argument like an attempt at legitimate debate. That's not r/iamverysmart material or anything, that's what I'd expect from a subreddit that supposedly favors intellectual discussion. If looking for a valid discussion is "taking myself too seriously", then I really don't know what to say.</p>

<p>Curious. Is that truly fulfilling? I honestly imagine it can't be, or that the euphoria you get is fleeting. Most people prefer to get along. I tend to get more satisfaction  reflecting on pleasant memories rather than arguments but to each his own. </p>
<p>For someone who claims to be able to point out flawed arguments you sure tend to misquote often which is important if you're to counter an argument properly. </p>
<p>"<em>Neither you nor your grandmother are dead, therefore Corona is overblown</em>" </p>
<p>Again I said nothing of my own grandmother. This is the third time you've done this despite being corrected and you admitting you misunderstanding initially.</p>
<p>Here is the second: "<em>Instead, you basically cited "You and your grandmother aren't dead" as evidence that Corona's overblown. This is my issue with your post. That is objectively terrible evidence.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Instead of responding to either of your critics, who supposedly missed the joke, by telling them it was satire, you started to try and make legitimate arguments that defend the usage of the flawed argument</em>."</p>
<p>You seem to forget there is some truth to humor. A joke in passing is fun, but if you have to break it down it loses that magic. That is you in a nutshell. I can address people on an individual basis as I please. It appears the majority of your interactions are online which is why you expect (it seems a little more like demand to me) people to remain consistent in tone when quite frankly, someone with my personality finds that boring and a bit anti-social. You definitely are not invited to many parties I bet. If you are you might cause someone like me to get blackout drunk if you ever were to join in on a conversation. </p>
<p>"<em>If looking for a valid discussion is "taking myself too seriously", then I really don't know what to say</em>."</p>
<p>Says the user who proceeds to write a whole essay on what he thinks is appropriate satire, lol! Seriously?! In all honesty it is entertaining to see someone so serious go to such great lengths to educate me on the subtleties of humor. LMAO, thank you universe/God.</p>

        <p>Is argumentation fulfilling? No? I don't comment on people's post on reddit to get a sense of fulfillment, I do it because I have some downtime and there isn't anything more pertinent to do in the moment. It's not as though I get euphoria from doing something like this, I mean, would you call being in a debate team or something a euphoric experience? </p>
<p>&rt;For someone who claims to be able to point out flawed arguments you sure tend to misquote often which is important if you're to counter an argument properly.</p>
<p>I didn't quote you in my last comment, I paraphrased your viewpoints. I delineated between quoting you, and paraphrasing, by prefacing my paraphrase with "roughly" and "something along the lines of". That pretty clearly shows that I wasn't attempting to make a direct quote. The misunderstanding is on your part, not mine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you missed that for whatever reason, and legitimately assumed that I was directly quoting you, then why did you assume that I was talking about your grandmother specifically? You stated "your" grandmother, addressed to your audience in your original post. Me quoting that wouldn't make it refer to your grandmother, it would still be referring to who you referenced - your audiences' grandmothers.</p>
<p>&rt;You seem to forget there is some truth to humor.</p>
<p>You're right. There is some truth to humor. That, out of context, is a valid statement. The reason why I'm pressing you about this specifically, though is because what your humor was trying to achieve - making fun of pro-maskers by using a faulty argument - is entirely undermined by you then defending that argument. The "truth" to the satire you were supposedly using would be that some people legitimately hold that viewpoint - in your perspective, on the pro-mask side - not that a viewpoint of that caliber is correct. </p>
<p>&rt;You definitely are not invited to many parties I bet.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure why you're just insulting me at this point. My dude, if you don't want to have a discussion, you're not forced to. I mean, I could call out Ad-hominin, but you'd probably interpret that as "too serious", so.</p>
<p>&rt;Says the user who proceeds to write a whole essay on what he thinks is appropriate satire</p>
<p>It seems as if that still wasn't enough, given that you neglected to respond to...any of the points that I made. I didn't say that your satire was inappropriate. I didn't say that the original joke was poor, I didn't say that it was factually incorrect, I said none of that. I said that, in summation, it was contradictory to your actions; it didn't make sense. You made a satirical joke, then contradicted that joke, by defending what it was making fun of. Was it funny? Comedy is subjective, I'm not the judge of that, but I can tell you that the way you approached it wasn't particularly sensible. You're yet to refute that.</p>
<p>It's pretty clear that you're not looking for any sort of discussion at this point. I fully elaborated on my viewpoints and gave examples, and your retort was that I'm not fun at parties and speak online a lot, ignoring how you have significantly more text submitted through reddit in 6 months than I've had in almost 3 years. I mean, that much is just hypocritical. I'll leave the discussion there, and hope that you understand, in the future, where you were wrong in this conversation.</p>

<p>You are not here for discussion you're here to be argumentative. That is clear in your statement above which is literal and also obvious since you choose remain on the fence on a controversial subject, even though you yourself said you tend to disagree with many post on this sub. Contradictory in my opinion.</p>
<p>"<em>Is argumentation fulfilling? No? I don't comment on people's post on reddit to get a sense of fulfillment, I do it because I have some downtime and there isn't anything more pertinent to do in the moment</em>."</p>
<p>This is fascinating since most people on this sub don't go to covidiots to do what you're doing here. Nope we stay right here and form a sense of community. I personally do something far more constructive with my downtime that is more enjoyable.</p>
<p><em>"The reason why I'm pressing you about this specifically, though is because what your humor was trying to achieve - making fun of pro-maskers by using a faulty argument -</em> <strong><em>is entirely undermined by you then defending that argument</em></strong>*. <em>The "truth" to the satire you were supposedly using would be that some people legitimately hold that viewpoint - in your perspective, on the pro-mask side - not that a viewpoint of that caliber is correct."*</em></p>
<p>I chose to address someone individually, it is allowable due to the fact that human nature is messy. It's like watching a movie and everything is all good next thing you know the main character is going to be sacrificed. Everyone is crying and then the comic relief comes in, next thing you know the audience is laughing and wiping away tears at the same time. Then the honorable death comes and the mood is somber. I have no control over what people ask in the comments. I do have control over whether I choose to respond to them and how. I can continue the sarcasm and satire or I can change direction completely, there are no specific rules to follow. You're arguing just to argue and that is quite frankly annoying and I expressed that earlier, yet you continue to press on. I have done what you're doing in the past and I'm seeing how I looked very clearly now and find that when people were kurt or short with me it was most definitely warranted.</p>
<p><em>"You made a satirical joke, then contradicted that joke, by defending what it was making fun of. Was it funny? Comedy is subjective, I'm not the judge of that, but I can tell you that the way you approached it wasn't particularly sensible. You're yet to refute that."</em></p>
<p>Again, I addressed another commenter individually. That person decided not to answer my question, in fact they said:</p>
<p>"<em>Don't need any experience, I listen to scientists and public health officials, you play Russian roulette</em>."</p>
<p>Which doesn't make sense because we all have experienced covid on some level whether someone we knew has been infected/died of it or not yet I'm the target of your mental prowess, lol!</p>
<p>You haven't seemed to grasp that you're not the authority on what I post or how I respond to you or anyone else. I can do as I please, even to your dissatisfaction believe it or not and I happily acknowledge you have the same freedom. Don't be surprised if you get your feelings hurt from time to time due to your "pressing" on some subject matters. Honestly if you are so butt hurt by my quip you should find something better to do on your downtime to avoid further emotional discomfort from what you call a "discussion".</p>
