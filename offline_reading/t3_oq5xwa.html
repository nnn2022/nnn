    <strong>This entire situation has me wondering something</strong>
    <p><p>How many people slept through the previous wars? We're there people that just shook off what was happening without a care for the future like what we see today? I don't have kids, but I try to wake my siblings up to what the future holds for their kids if they don't wake up and fight and they just do not see a problem and think it's all just fine. Did people not care about their kids in the past as well?</p></p>

        <p>Normal people just have too much shit on to take any notice of the bigger picture. They have rent or mortgages to worry about. Maybe a business to keep going. They don't need any more worries. Best enemy though ... An invisible one...</p>

        <p>No excuse. I run 3 companies and I stay engaged. I think it's part of a CEO's job to be aware of shit going on in the world. I'm watching my fellow business owners destroy their own livelihood due to irrational fear.</p>

        <p>That is of their own doing, and a lot of their 'business' and distraction is what they create themselves.</p>

        <p>Short answer- yes. Longer answer would be too long to post. I can give a slight look into Bush's "GWOT" though- one complaint from Democrats was that 'Americans are not suffering enough". Yes, they wanted everyone to suffer even then. Some wanted to reinstate the Draft to force young men to the military that the military didn't want. Not for need for the war effort, just to create suffering.  The country was divided by one small group "Rah! Kill 'em all!", another small group "this was is stupid!" but the majority "Meh, how's my stocks doing?"</p>

        <p>In my opinion, the rise and grip of Feminism in the West, and the seeking of selfish needs and the rising percentage of general narcissism means:  </p>
<p>Yes, Moms care less about their kids, and more about themselves.</p>
<p>They stick their kids into daycare from a young age so they can pursue a career.</p>
<p>They can't have silly kids get in the way, so they will vax and mask them up and drop them off at the school as part of the game. Mom's not gonna stay home with her kids to make a point or assert her rights.</p>
<p>Dad's not around either to temper this or give any  guidance. If he is, he's probably been cucked and shamed into submission, or threatened with divorce so decides to 'go along to get along' and has no say in the household.</p>
<p>So yes, people care about their kids less these days, and the number of Masks I see on kids on a daily basis - like today during a beautiful blue sky, forced to wear Masks at Mom's direction.</p>
<p>Thank-you, I know await the downvotes from triggered fems and NAWALT advocates :D</p>
