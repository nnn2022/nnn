    <strong>Boyfriend refuses to wake up. Advice?</strong>
    <p><p>My (f/30) boyfriend (m/37)of almost 3 years wants to break up because we have different ‚Äúvalues and beliefs‚Äù surrounding the nwo agenda and this Covid nightmare. I have been spelling everything out for him since Covid hit. I have sent him countless pages of evidence and all kinds of information almost every day since last March. I was hopeful because he agreed not to get the vax. He also admitted that the government is corrupt but he simply will not admit that this all is happening. Even though v passports and digital currency are literally out in the open at this point he refuses to believe that this is all a part of a broader plot. When I try to talk to him about this he can‚Äôt come up with a logical reason why this isn‚Äôt happening the way I am explaining it is. He just says he doesn‚Äôt understand how all these countries could come together to roll out this plan. </p>
<p>He says all I bring is talk of the nwo, masks ect but it‚Äôs hard not to when this is the end of humanity/freedom as we know it. I don‚Äôt even talk about it that much anymore just when something major comes up. </p>
<p>All I want to do is live off grid because that‚Äôs all I can come up with as a solution and he says he doesn‚Äôt love me enough to do that. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm scared. The only hope I had to escape what‚Äôs coming is to live off grid with him and now that isn‚Äôt happening I just feel like a sitting duck as a single female alone in a city. I could hypothetically live off grid by myself but that seems near impossible to pull off and really not ideal safety/sanity wise.</p>
<p>I really love this person and I‚Äôm just really heartbroken. I need a partner through this. I‚Äôm terrified and literally alone without friends or family. He is my best friend but no matter what he refuses to wake up because he says it messes up his whole ability to have hope for his life if he admits that this is really happening. Can anyone relate? What have you done or how have you come to terms with this ending relationships with loved ones?</p></p>

        <p>My long term relationship ended when this all started last year. Some people just don‚Äôt get it, no matter how much you try to show them. She left me. You might have to be prepared for a breakup if it causes that much of a divide between the two of you.</p>

        <p>Yea I‚Äôm realizing now how damaging it was to never be believed. Like I‚Äôm not making this shit up. It‚Äôs bad enough that the media coins people who are trying to point out the truth ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù much less my own partner not believing me. It was too much. The gravity of this situation is intense. If it was buzzing collectively that we were on the verge of totalitarian takeover and basically getting poisoned or being stripped of the ability to feed ourselves everyone would be panicked. But no...people are ok. It‚Äôs ‚Äúnot that bad‚Äù because they‚Äôre willfully ignorant. I realize now that I was feeling gaslit by my ex about this subject simply because he was playing devil‚Äôs advocate and did NOT want to believe it. So frustrating.</p>
<p>And yea I really love him and miss him too. Sucks that it had to go this way.</p>

        <p>Same. We promised each other we wouldn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs weak. Plus it adds context as to why he broke up with me. My idea was to get out of the rat race and onto some land - he would rather submit his body to this shit. We are not the same. He is a nurse in NJ and I guess they were requiring it? I feel sick, this is a nightmare. At lease I did everything I could to inform him.</p>

        <p>You are not alone sister, there are many more like you. We are separated, but not alone. You need someone like-minded on this journey we are in, or a community that is like-minded that will support their members in need. Ask around, find something local. Best to have 1 friendly neighbor than 100 fake friends. </p>
<p>There really is no more escaping this in the future, this is not a drill. Unfortunately, it is likely you will probably let go of him, and find someone more like-minded, because you will only drift further apart in the future, especially when measures will become strict and more principal choices will have to be made in life.</p>
<p>Thinking to get off the grid is a wise idea. Stick with it, find ways to achieve this. God bless you.</p>

        <p>I was not religious either, until I started reading the Bible. The whole world, how people behave, including all the lies we see, today, made sudden and complete sense. It is shocking when you see ageless wisdom and truth written down and recognize it to be the truth, because that almost never happens.</p>
<p>If you just read one part of the Bible (if you can get past all the hate and ridicule they deliberately plant in our heads against the book), read Matthew, KJV.</p>

        <p>It has been manipulated, that's why you should avoid all modern versions if possible. The haters tell you it's fake, because of this. I say the opposite: all the manipulation is showing you one thing: they don't like the truth of the book, and they need to change it for their own purposes. 
That doesn't mean the core of the book still stands as a house. It is the most researched, referenced, and fact-check verified book in the world, no matter what they try to tell you.</p>

        <p>"He says all I bring is talk of the nwo," this is your issue; just drop the subject altogether if you want to keep the relationship happy. You don't need to agree about everything
"All I want to do is live off grid because that‚Äôs all I can come up with as a solution" 
Take a deep breath and relax. If this was not your lifestyle plan when you too first dated, then of course he'd want to bail out if you suddenly changed your future plans</p>

        <p>My MIL absolutely REFUSES to see anything wrong with what's going on. I pointed out how fascistic Joe Biden's tweet was this morning and she just scoffed and shook her head. Showed her the videos of the dancing nurses - same response. Pointed out how many people die in India every damn day yet she still insists the pandemic is real and that what's going on over there is super serious. Some people just don't or can't admit that we're being fucked with here.</p>
<p>Luckily my wife sees through most of it but has no strong opinions either way so she's kind of caught in the middle, which sucks.</p>

<p>Okay then. There you go. As hard as it is, you said the most important thing in the entire post right there. What a waste of time and emotion if he doesn't love you enough.</p>
<p>Sorry this seemed cold. I'm sure you love them. I don't know how to get someone to open their eyes who refuses to. I definitely wouldn't comply to gene therapy to make him happy. Maybe he could argue that's you not loving him enough. Maybe it's not compatible / meant to be?</p>

        <p>Yea, it seems like it's about a lot more. You guys have completely polarized perspectives on what is happening in the world. This will make you want to live your lives in entirely polarizing ways. The things you want in life based off of that world view are the things he does not want to be. You sound like you want someone to take you away form the madness and to love you and live the most natural life possible despite the state of the world. Sounds like he wants to remain in that world because he doesn't see the state of it as bad as you do.</p>
<p>I will pray for you, I'm just sorry that I don't know how to change someone's views on what's happening</p>

        <p>Yep. Same boat. Would you should consider showing him how much it effects the woman‚Äôs reproductive system to be around a vaccinated man?

        <p>These type of people are the ones that you show things  to make them see a new way. I'm not only saying it with what is happening right now.

        <p>I couldn't be with someone who's not awake to most of what is going on. My plan in the future is to live off grid as well. I could only do that with a like minded man, but I'm single and have been for years, so I have zero problem doing it alone. Get some big dogs, get some basic self defense training, and get some guns, and you won't have to worry about safety as much. </p>

        <p>Relax a little.  Get off of social media.  BOTH of you back out of politics and reconnect.  I do NOT understand why people are letting this get in the middle of relationships.  Losing all hope is a very big deal.  I went through it when I was waking up.  My husband began to understand the process had to be slowed down.  I came very close to going nuts because of the this is the end of the world mentality.  If he agreed to not get the van count your blessings and relax.</p>

They're poisoning us through a thousand other means, no need for jets to spray anything into the air, trust me.</p>
<p>Maybe point out the significant differences between reality and the reality they want us to buy into as portrayed in the media.  We don't all have a full picture of everything going on, but what we do know is that it isn't right.  It's something we can all feel in our gut, and I'm sure your boyfriend can feel it too.</p>

        <p>I agree with what you're saying, but in my opinion, at a certain point you have to stop and see if you're being as anti mask crazy as some of the pro mask crazy people.</p>
<p>Again, not to say that you're wrong, but you admit that you can't stop talking about all this stuff going on. I think that would get on anyone's nerves, no matter what side of the aisle you're on. </p>
<p>I resist by living my life as normal and not letting all the hysteria that the media causes get the better of me. If you're letting your relationship fall apart because of this, then maybe it's getting the better of you. </p>
<p>I'll probably get downvoted for this, but that's just my perspective.</p>
