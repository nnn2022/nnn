    <strong>Everyone here is an idiot</strong>
    <p><p>How do you <em>want</em> more people to be affected, it just doesn't make sense, you say you want us to go back to normal, sure when a thousand people aren't dying per day, then we can go back to normal. People like you are the reason people are dying.</p></p>

<p>Out of roughly 59,000,000... that's roughly 0.0017%...... Yeah, influenza does a better job than that each year.  Not worried.  I'm a healthcare worker and I have a better chance of dying in a car crash than I do of dying from this virus.</p>

        <p>The worst way to think is to act as though a third party's actions could have prevented the people who died from dying. The overwhelming majority of people who have died from this are the kinds of people that have the chance to die anytime they get sick from anything. When you're over the age of 70 - it's crunch time. Human beings don't naturally live as long as we've managed to make the norm.</p>
<p>We're talking about 75+ year old people are the ones who are dying, they're already fortunate to have made it that long. I know young people think they'll all live into your 80s and higher, but statistically you won't. You'll get old, catch a cold and die. It's very unfortunate, but every flu season this happens to this same group of people. Life isn't a bell curve, once you hit your mid point - that end point can be much closer than you think if you haven't been taking care of yourself</p>

        <p>If you're really concerned about human life, you should listen to a nurse--Erin Olszewski.  In this video, she documents that her hospital in Tampa, Florida was empty in April/May and NONE of their "Covid patients" died.</p>
<p>So she volunteered to go to the "epicenter of the epicenter" in NYC because she was concerned about human life:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDsKdeFOmQ</a></p>
<p>She found that many of the cruel "health care workers" in NYC were murdering these "Covid" patients by ventilating them to death and other means in order to goose Fredo's death-o-meter he's been running on CNN for the past 7 months.</p>
<p>Or read Erin's book "Undercover Epicenter Nurse: How Fraud, Negligence, and Greed Led to Unnecessary Deaths at Elmhurst Hospital":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Epicenter-Nurse-Negligence-Unnecessary/dp/151076366X">https://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Epicenter-Nurse-Negligence-Unnecessary/dp/151076366X</a></p>
<p>This nurse from Elko NV went to NYC during the same period and saw the same thing:</p>

<p>Pardon her crying during the video--but she is concerned for human life.</p>
<p>If you are really concerned about human life, you might consider the UN's estimate that 10s of millions of 3rd world human beings will starve to death due to the disruption of the world's food economy.  Fredo doesn't mention this on CNN, nor like Fauci is he familiar with cost/benefit analysis, so you may not have heard about it. But if you're really concerned about human life, you should vet Fredo's narrative by considering other sources who are concerned about human life.</p>

        <p>Are you concerned for the lives affected and that will be affected by these lockdowns and mandates?   Are you aware that a rise in unemployment causes a rise in deaths that will have nothing to do with covid?  Do they not matter?  For a virus that still has not been isolated and uses a sketchy test that produces false-positives.</p>
<p>The impact of this 'new normal' crap is going to have a far worse outcome than the virus ever would.  BY FAR.  You should be concerned about that.  When you are out living on the street in the cold of winter because you lost your job, your home, couldn't pay bills, and don't have any food..  at least you wore your freakin' mask.  Sleep well.</p>
