    <strong>Governor Dim Walz Pretends like he’s Trying to Lift Restrictions by Setting a Vaccination Threshold to End State-Wide Mask Mandates</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.kare11.com/mobile/article/news/local/governor-walz-minnesota-covid-reopening-timeline/89-aabd04b6-9535-4600-a60f-0cc3bf1e1d0c">Gov. Walz details timeline to end Minnesota COVID restrictions</a></p>
<p>The Glorious Leader Dim Walz is saying that if 70% of people over 16 get the vaccine by July 1st they will end the state-wide mask mandate. </p>
<p>This is another “lock everything down” type of action. If you look at the vaccination graph, it’s starting to level off at around 48-49% for the state of Minnesota. He waited until the graph started to plateau and then picked an arbitrary number above that (that we all know we’ll never hit) for the threshold of when masks will be lifted. By doing this he gets to say “I did everything I could” (just like most governors did with lockdowns) and everyone will be angry at the “AnTi-vaXxERs” instead of him.  I’m not sure if the vaccination graph is for all populations or just those eligible for the vaccine. If it’s the former, we need another 20 percentage points for this to happen...not likely; If it’s the latter, we need another 6-7 percentage points for it to happen, easier but still unlikely.</p>
<p>The article reads:
“There will be no new safety requirements for businesses, though they must maintain their plans to keep their employees and customers safe – as they have from the beginning of the pandemic – guided only by a minimal universal state guidance document”</p>
<p>So basically every restaurant will continue to force you to wear a mask for the 20 foot walk to your table where you’re able to then take it off. Brilliant.</p>
<p>“Remaining face covering requirement and the requirement for preparedness plans will end. Work on vaccines will continue, and local jurisdictions and entities may set their own mask policies.”</p>
<p>I may be wrong but I ran the numbers and I think there is about a 0% chance that local entities will be lifting their mask mandates. The only way they would stop is if Walz pulled a DeSantis and told local entities it was basically against the law to require masks, which we all know will not happen. It’s just more kicking the can down the road; More dangling the carrot in front of people’s faces so they feel more justified in confronting and berating people into getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>I’m glad the vaccinations are waning (a lot sooner than I thought they would) but this is all just optics to further separate the consequences from the root of the problem...PEOPLE/GOVERNMENT NOT THE ILLNESS.</p></p>

        <p>Yes it sounds like he is doing exactly what Uncle Joe is but on a smaller scale. Promise a reward for a goal you know you’re not gonna hit and then punish them for not hitting the goal. Although I think it will end up with them starting the whole vaccination process over since they claim it’s only good for 6 months. We will never get the carrot, only the stick.</p>

        <p>I thought he was saying he'd get rid of the mask mandate on July 1st, or when 70% are vaccinated, whichever comes first. </p>
<p>It's possible July 1st will come around and he'll say, "Well, we can't lift the mask mandate because we're not at 70%" but that's not what he said today.</p>
<p>But I do agree with you that all the blue counties will just put in their own mask mandates unless prohibited from doing so.</p>

        <p>Yeah I can’t tell what the policy is. Someone else pointed out another article saying it’s whichever comes first but in this article is not clear.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the media sucks. (Not just because they're biased, but most articles are just really unclear or lack important details). <a href="https://mn.gov/covid19/stay-safe/overview/index.jsp">Here's a link to the State's website</a>, which does suggest that their current plan is no masks on July 1st, no matter what.</p>
