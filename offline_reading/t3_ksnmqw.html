        <p>This is a sarcastic post, but I think I'll add some interesting data to go with it.</p>
<p>Men aren't grandpas for as long as women are grandmas. They are older than women when they have their first child and die sooner.</p>
<p>In the United States, men are about 25 when they have their first child. Women are 23. Men live to about 76 and women live to about 81. This varies across socio-economic factors and personal family planning, but it's good to illustrate that grandpas die sooner.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, this would be the family tree of decay:</p>
<ul>
<li>Man and Woman have their child at 25 and 23 years old.</li>
<li>Child has their own child at 25 if a guy and 23 if a girl. That means that the Man is a grandpa at 48-50 and the Woman is a grandma at 46-48.</li>
<li>However, Grandpa only has 24-26 years with their grandchild compared to Grandma who has 31-33 years.</li>
<li>In addition, it's likely Grandpa is only a Great-Grandpa for 1-3 years whereas Grandma is a Great-Grandma for 6-8 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are less grandpas because they're already dead.</p>

        <p>There have been several posts here claiming  women are the primary victims of covid.  The feminists never let a crisis go to waste.</p>
<p>It's sickness of the mind.....</p>
<p>It is against the law to discriminate against people based upon gender.   Not one of our female engineers has been laid off.  Not one.</p>

        <p>Back in June my dad tested positive for it prior to going in for a routine colonoscopy. He was fine and survived it. No symptoms at all.  But if my mom would have gotten it, I'm sure she'd be dead.</p>
