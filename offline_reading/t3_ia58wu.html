    <strong>On this day, 51 years ago, Woodstock Music Festival began. An estimated 400,000 people attended despite the 1968-69 Hong Kong flu still raging.</strong>
    <p><p>From August 15-18, on a dairy farm in New York, the Woodstock Music festival took place.</p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock</p>
<p>During that time, the Hong Kong flu pandemic was raging. </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_flu</p>
<p>The world population in 1968 was 3.5 billion people, less than half of what it is today. Worldwide death estimates range from 1-4 million deaths. Adjusted for population, that would mean today there would have been 2-8 million deaths. What's funny is that an actual second wave happened with this pandemic in 1969-70 that killed more people.</p>
<p>It's barely a footnote in history anymore, just like the 1957 pandemic. Life didn't grind to a halt, nothing was cancelled months or years in the future and no one was quacking about a "New Normal". Masks weren't mandated, social distancing wasn't a concept. Life went on as normal.</p>
<p>400k people attended Woodstock without a care in the world, no distancing or masks at all.</p>
<p>What happened to us?</p></p>

        <p>Social media and the internet have the ability to override your lived experience. Think about if this was going on in 1980. You'd go through your day and see people living normally. Maybe you'd know a distant relative affected and read about the virus in the paper the next day, calmly over coffee.</p>
<p>Today you can live in an alternate reality, burrowed in your house as every oddity in a world of 7bn is pumped to your phone. Yes the outside world looks fine to me, but why are they telling me a 21 y/o died in the UK who was "perfectly healthy"?</p>
<p>These stories wouldn't have been a blip on the national radar decades ago, now they can serve panic from your own home.</p>

        <p>Reaction outside of the U.S. is because every country takes their cues from the World Health Organisation and "experts" that all parrot the same story.  Together with controlled media (eg: Operation Mockingbird), any narrative desired can be spread throughout the world.</p>

        <p>No Trump wasn't president, and the DNC back in the day was reasonable and was basically what the Republican party is today, its a shame what's happened over the past few decades, maybe we need a good dose of McCarthyism and hopped up hippies again.</p>

        <p>Interesting observation, thanks.</p>
<p>~~daily newnormal rant mode engaged~~</p>
<p><em>What happened to us?</em></p>
<p>1) The ever-advancing regulatory state and the bureaucrat/lawyer-driven fear of "negligence".</p>
<p>2) Add in identity politics with the mask stuff and the human fear of contagion and you get some of the most disgusting psychology the human population collectively is capable of. In Nazi Germany, they were trained to think of Jews as "contagions". I am claiming something big and possibly offensive, but I sincerely believe true: the exact same group-psychological impulses are going on here. It is a reminder of a fundamental aspect of human nature (apparently).  I am going to bet that the people in this sub have much higher-than-usual disgust tolerances. I believe I do.</p>
<p>We have self-selected because we are not these contagion-oriented people. Contagion fear makes people sheep(er) and authority-abiding, somehow. This whole thing has been a reminder that people are slaves to their non-conscious instincts in ways which we cannot normally observe on a large scale. We don't have this instinct; this is why everybody here is saying "what is happening, am I taking crazy pills" all the time (rightly). We have self-selected into two substantially different psychological groups in society <em>because of the unceasing pandemic fear-mongering</em>, which has never been present in past pandemics. I worked in a hospital in 2009. There were policies for that pandemic. There was not a mask in sight. Society carried on.</p>
<p>So I am only freaked out by the <em>people freaking out</em>, because I have a dialed-down version of this contagion instinct, which makes these other people seem foreign. We would not be snitching on our neighbors in East Germany because our minds are less beholden to the sheep-following-(evil)-shepherd instinct, for whatever reason. We are possibly people who are slightly more likely to fight back one day, penned up in a concentration camp, even if it meant death. Talk about a hagiography I am writing for us! Am I wrong?</p>
<p>Politics is personality and not much more. The reason we came up with human rights and social contracts is to put hard limits on how the frail human personality can intrude onto another personality. The people in charge these days consider the old social contract quaint and won't make decisions based on bedrock principles of free society. </p>
<p>3) Modern politics is built around a million disparate people yelling "do something, government!" about every problem, every imagined fear, because there is no understanding of what a reasonable "social contract" looks like any more. Meanwhile they don't want to pay any taxes for the government to "do something" about anything. Which, though, is kind of fair, because governments, who would seem to have vast pricing power, cannot spend money worth a damn because they've become designed to be slush funds for employees and contractors.</p>
<p>Well, you say to me, didn't you also yell at your local government today. Yes, but I yelled at them to <em>do nothing more</em>. That is the key and why I feel justified. All I am asking for is what democracy itself already provides. I asked the government to do nothing, but because nothing isn't something, it is not given credence. And these city councilors and other pols don't build their egos and their brands by <em>failing</em> to put more words on paper and "consider both sides" (all of which restrict society more). There is no brand power in "principles" any more. The councilor who replied to me sent a generic long email that was the usual "both sides" drivel (TBH I was amazed there was anything for my side re masks). They have no bedrock principles on which to make important decisions. They pretend to hem and haw and then they step one step closer to fascism because fascist ideas feel "safe", and the sheep don't feel "safe". (There are places where I can understand that, even. Where I am is not one of them.)</p>
<p>🔮 So that is what I think is happening thank you goodbye</p>

        <p>Definitely think you’re right about point 2. Illness has simply never been in the “concern” box for me. My parents were really low key about illness growing up. We handled illnesses as they came. My parents never rushed me to the hospital and just used their instincts to get us back to health whenever we were sick. We weren’t hypochondriacs. It was just known that sometimes illness causes death but most likely won’t so stay hydrated and keep the fever down and get through it. I’m not scared of getting sick. I don’t blame people for spreading illness because it just happens. And being surrounded by people who can’t accept that illness is something that just happens has been truly insufferable.</p>

        <p>Great post. One of my key learnings in all this is that fear itself is something to worry about (maybe FDR was onto something). When the lockdowns started I wasn't fearful of losing supplies, but everyone else was and that led to shortages. Not the virus itself, but the panic. Next time around I'll be prepared and take people panicking seriously 🙄</p>

        <p>Wow, I appreciate that, thanks. (And this is the stuff I rattle off without trying to improve on. I wish that I had the "social surplus" to write essays under my own name for publication, and take the hostility that it would engender, but I don't. Or I would. There are other reasons beyond hostility that it would not be a good idea for me in particular. It's a loss for me.)</p>

<p>I'm the first to admit it's really under-utilizing a lot of time and/or skill to write that much into a small sub and not even be on topic for the post (Woodstock-era pandemic vs now)!! It's my weakness.</p>

        <p>There you are again with your great perspective, reddit friend. (I was going to say that separately, but never got back. I'm saying it now. You have amazing perspective for someone in their 20s! And period, of course. You said your age publically to me so I'm assuming you don't mind me bringing up here in bottom-of-page-land.)</p>
<p>I don't want to get off topic, but I find that the traditional stereotypes behind "conservative and liberal" in personality typing are becoming meaningless these days.</p>
<p>I read a certain "lefty" web site a lot, and they have really low tolerance and non-disgust levels in a lot of ways. I find them to be highly conservative in personality style a lot of the time. They are always "disgusted" with something.The people most ardent about "woke" politics are intolerant people in very meaningful ways. Does anyone honestly think a "woke" woman on twitter (seen on r/stupidpol the other day) who says something like "Give me one example of white culture NOT appropriating someone else's culture. We have stolen everything from other cultures" is not in some way disgust-oriented, intolerant and highly conservative along certain personality dimensions?</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>

        <p>Sorry for the late reply! I upvoted the other night, but was too tired to reply, then I got a migraine and some Reddit drama with a troll I shouldn't have fed lol</p>
<p>Thank you for the compliments! :) No, I don't mind my age being brought up at all. If anything, I want people to know, because I want to counter some of the stereotypes regarding my age group. That said, I'm vague about my exact age for privacy purposes and so people can't use it as a "gotcha!" because I'm "too young" or "too old" for something.</p>
<p>I agree that the dichotomy between "liberal" and "conservative" is losing meaning, if it ever really had any. At the very least, left vs right is a gross oversimplification, as there is much more nuance to be had in politics and philosophy. For this reason, the left often accuses me of being a far right/alt right troll, while the right often accuses me of being a leftist troll. Both sides often mistake me for a man and vehemently deny that a woman would have my values or speech patterns.</p>
<p>Yeah, I read the comment that claims conservatives have higher disgust reactions and my immediate though is "Disgust toward what though?" because of precisely what you said: many liberals also feel disgust toward many things. A particularly relevant example being disgust toward uncovered faces and people within 6 feet of each other. Not that all liberals are pro-mask or pro-distancing, just as not all conservatives are anti-mask or anti-distancing, but there certainly seems to be a correlation between the left and authoritarianism, and another correlation between authoritarianism and COVID control measures. I have a pet theory that it has a lot to do with changes in hormone/neurotransmitter levels induced by changes in population density, exacerbated by the media bringing us all closer together so that our cognitive/emotional functions are spread thin over a much bigger pack. Or more like a hive.</p>
<p>Yeah haha, anyway.</p>

        <p>Very astute observations! I would argue that we too are beholden to our instincts, though perhaps with different dominant (NOT domineering) instincts than the hysterical masses. Personally, I have an instinctive aversion to allowing anyone but those closest to me (my husband, perhaps other females we acquire) to touch or examine my body. I've always felt this way, which is why I don't go to doctors or hospitals, and my desire for medical self-sufficiency is a major driving factor in this passion for medicine/biology I've had since early childhood. I'm also not truly devoid of the contagion instinct, I'm just concerned with different contagions. Particularly MRSA and C Diff. Things that smell bad, reminiscent of rot.</p>
<p>As for those millions of disparate people yelling for the government to do something, this is why I'm a decentralist. If you want something done right, do it yourself, or find/build a community of shared interest that genuinely cares for each other. But I know that's much easier said than done.</p>

        <p>Completely ignoring the fact that today there are not only proportionally more older people in the world than in '68, which is the demographic that was most affected by the virus, there are millions and millions more obese people. The adjusted for population figure of 2-8 million may have been even higher than that today if accounted for the overall health of the population.</p>

        <p>Great comments on this thread. I’d like to add that the news media in the 1960s was still functional compared to what we have now. Also, they didn’t have even the 24 hour cable news cycle spewing as much drummed up content to justify its existence, nor the constant stream of stupidity and manipulation that social media brings. Most of the Woodstock generation may not have even been aware that there was a “bad flu” going around that year. Heck, I don’t remember hearing about it in 2009 because I was too busy at the time working on college coursework.</p>

<p>People keep saying that boomers are the ones overwhelmingly in support of lockdowns, and while I'm sure there are some, it appears the vast majority of the pro-lockdown crowd are in the 50 and under age range.</p>

        <p>I don’t think you guys are understanding me. I’m not saying that I think boomers are overwhelmingly supportive as an age group, or even the biggest drivers of the lockdown. I’m just saying I’ll bet that aging, hippies are more likely than not to be pro lockdown.</p>

<p>For one thing, do you think these people still hold the exact same values they did back when they were young? People can and do change, especially politically. </p>
<p>Also, again, we are not seeing this overwhelming support for lockdowns from old people. It's coming from people in the 20-50 age groups.</p>

        <p>From my experience, Boomers and Gen-Xers tend to be more pro-lockdown. Not young people, not old people, middle-aged people. That said, you have a point about the aging hippies. At least SOME aging hippies. Many have become authoritarian COVID-phobics, yet perhaps just as many have become more anti-authoritarian with age, such as my anti-lockdown mother. My mother-in-law is the same age, but was decidedly NOT a hippie and is more-or-less supportive of the lockdowns. Though she seems to be coming around.</p>

        <p>I usually dump on boomers more than the next person, but on average I’ve seen less people in this age group being crazy lockdowners despite the fact that they’re more at risk than younger people. And tbh, I blame them less when they are scared because of their risk. It’s really the GenX and millennials who are driving the lockdowns and the ones who make my blood boil for doing so.</p>

        <p>Your statement still confirms the posts intent.  The only reason we consider Covid to still be 'raging' is because of constant testing, and the media blasting us with it everyday.  Hong Kong Flu was still around during the time of Woodstock, and did have second waves in parts of the world in the Fall of '69.  Yet life went on without major disruptions to society.</p>

        <p>It might not have been "raging" because we really didn't test for it. Hell, even in 2009 with incredible advancements in diagnostics and technology we were barely testing for H1N1. We can't know if it wasn't still raging even in the US by August.</p>
<p>But because we are extremely aggressively testing for COVID, we are seeing cases everywhere even though the incredible vast majority of them are sub-clinical and asympttomatic. It makes little sense to keep track of so many cases at this point.</p>
