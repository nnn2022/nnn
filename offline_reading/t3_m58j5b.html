        <p>Do you know that the types of masks that have a significant level of resistance to flow are not the same kind the public is being instructed to wear? They are medical masks used for safe intervals by medical professionals. </p>
<p>The masks the public need to wear have gaps at the sides through which oxygen can enter. Oxygen can also get in through holes in the mask, yes with maybe a bit of resistance but no blockage. They are the best mix of protection from viral particles and breathability that has been come up with so far</p>

        <p>Where I'm from cloth masks are equally recommended as medical masks. If there are "gaps for oxygen" to enter, then any aerosols may also freely enter. If masks work, why do you think so many healthcare workers who religiously wear masks still got covid? I believe they tried their very best and followed the rules and went even further, but still many got sick. What does this suggest?</p>
<p>If masks are so effective, what need do we have of a vaccine? For any virus? Not all are airborne, of course, but if we can take simple measures against the spread of viruses, why have any vaccines at all?</p>

<p>No one method is going to be perfect. By combining them you give yourself and others the best chance of avoiding infection</p>

        <p>Firstly, no one's making the argument to get rid of seatbelts or airbags for any reason. </p>
<p>Secondly, you didn't answer my question. I don't care about the size of the particles or molecules, I care that people who wear masks still got sick. And I care that worldwide, governments have ruined people's lives over a seasonal flu that doesn't kill any more people than average. So either deal with the facts (masks don't do anything) or move on.</p>

        <p>I’m talking about seatbelts because it’s an analogy to show you how dumb your argument is. I know no one is trying to get rid of seatbelts. That’s my point. People who wear seatbelts can still die in car crashes. People whose airbags go off can still die in car crashes. The point is that those things make those tragedies <em>less likely</em>. And that’s why no one is protesting against seat belts because “boo hoo don’t wike how dey dig into my shouldews”</p>
<p>My analogy was an answer to your question. You really think having to wear a piece of cloth on your face “ruins your life” more than being stuck in a hospital on a ventilator? You need to grow up and face facts. Masks have been proven to decrease the spread of covid. Those are the facts. That doesn’t mean no one who wears a mask will ever get sick, it means <em>fewer</em> people will get sick.</p>
<p>If you really think this is just the flu then jesus fuck I don’t know how to help you. I don’t know how to help someone so wilfully ignorant.</p>

        <p>But you didn't answer my question. What about the many hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers who are required to wear masks, and who likely wear masks in their personal lives also, that got covid? Refering to seatbelts isn't an answer.</p>
<p>Let's compare open states, or perhaps Sweden, to masked areas. We will quickly see masks don't have the positive effects you say they do. </p>
<p>It is just the flu. People have always died from the flu. Most people survive though.</p>
<p>And it's not about just masks, you short sighted buffoon. Look at the rest of the effects that came after people gave in to mask mandates. The side effects of the governments' actions have far outweighed the few covid deaths.</p>

        <p>You're not getting it. You don't need to be a scientist or work next to someone who is about to start their PhD (lol) to know oxygen molecules are smaller than the holes in the fabric of masks. We're making fun of this stupid straw man argument that mask-loving bootlickers bring up every time someone mentions difficulty breathing. If the mask 1) restricts enough of what is coming out of your mouth to "slow the spread of the virus", then it also 2) restricts enough of what is coming into your mouth to make it harder to breathe. The joke is at the expense of people who believe #1 but not #2. Thanks for your attempted contribution though.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t though. Just as a sieve will let water through but not larger particles, a mask will let oxygen though but not the virus. You acknowledge that the hole size is smaller than a virus droplet but larger than an oxygen molecule but don’t seem to connect that to the idea that oxygen will be able to get through the mask and the virus won’t? Did you never get one of those “peg and hole” toys when you were a kid or what?</p>
<p>Yes airflow will be slower but it won’t be blocked. You can breathe in a mask, as evidenced by the millions of people who have been wearing them no problem. Even before covid, doctors have been wearing masks for hours on end in surgery and other clinical environments.</p>

        <p>To be more clear, the virus itself is very small but it does not float around in the air by itself it exists in respiratory droplets which are blocked by masks as long as it's not neck gators, bandanas, or vented masks. 
Even the whole thing about the n95 micron rating where people said "see the virus is smaller than the micron rating". First off we go back to the droplet things. Those are larger. 2nd, the rating doesn't mean n95 doesn't protect against things smaller. If you actually look up how the n95 works, it actually captures things smaller than the micron rating. The micron rating is actually the size it is least effective at, and that is 95%. So smaller or larger ad it's more than 95% effective. You can easily find this info if you choose to.
Now, the whole.philosophy behind the public wearing masks to beat a pandemic is not to protect ourselves so an n95 is unnecessary. The philosophy is we all wear it so we don't u knowingly infect others. If we all do it the virus has no where to go. 
The reason this has gone on so long is because people only wore masks when they had to but continued to eat at indoor restaurants, go to bars, gather with friends and family who don't live in their household while not masked. 
If we had not done these things, had we been prepared and ready to mask up and not go outside of our house while we pinpoint where the virus is, quarantine those who need to be, we could have beat this thing. 
Other countries who were ready did, and they didn't have any lockdowns. Look at Taiwan and there are various other examples. 
Sad thing is not only were we not prepared but we haven't learned a damn thing and people scoff at over half a million dead like that's no big deal. It's sad and I hope the next novel virus that hits the US is taken more seriously and we have a plan. Otherwise, if it's in any way worse than covid, millions are going to die who don't need to. And we might have lockdowns again which aren't necessary.
If you were to play a game where you have to stop a virus what would you do? You'd have the people take preventative measures ie wear masks if you have to go out and don't socialize for a short period to stop the spread, pinpoint where it is, quarantine it appropriately, stomp it out, and then return to normal. It's so simple my 4 year old understands it. 
But people don't want simple they want political. And that's why we're in this mess.</p>

        <p>Masks only block particles, not molecules. and the ones people use in public nowerdays only very slightly restrict airflow, not enough to even make it difficult to breathe under heavy exercise.</p>
<p>The mask I wear from time to time at work however, it does restrict airflow quite significantly but it is still not difficult to do my physical job</p>

        <p>Do you want me to be perfectly honest, there is a reason why people with knowledge in physics and biology are making this call</p>
<p>I personally think that face masks are bull shit for a whole host of reasons and ai refuse to wear one, closest to one I wear is my gas mask which I use at work from time to time to not damage my lungs with actually harmful particles.</p>
<p>But saying that a thin fabric mask is suffocating people is just plain wrong, not even rubber can perfectly seal in oxygen and nitrogen from passing through it so how the hell should a thin fabric do it?</p>

        <p>Because we’ve worn clothes for hundreds of years. That is normal. Wearing masks is a new development. </p>
<p>The fact that you are trying to ease us into wearing masks by comparing it to already established norms is telling. You are trying to normalize this shit and make it part of our lifestyle for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <p>It already is normal. That’s the point. It’s easier and less obstructive than putting on pants on yet you have no issue with that. You just don’t like it because someone is telling you to do it. Literally a physical representation of selfishness.</p>

        <p>Correct, I am selfish. I don't care in the slightest about your safety or your life. Your health was not my responsibility when I went out in any year prior to 2020; it certainly is not my responsibility now.</p>
<p>Are you forgetting that wearing masks was supposed to be a temporary measure? How in the world are you going to argue that masks should be normalized just because they are mild inconveniences?</p>

        <p>No one is going to continue listening to us? LOL! That's why even more states recently lifted their mask mandates, right? People are done pretending they care about you. If you die, you die. (aka, the attitude we held in every year prior to 2020)</p>

        <p>Caring about others in society is one of the best parts of living in society. I care about your health even though you may not care about mine. I got the vaccine not only for myself, but to hopefully protect others as well. Same goes for wearing masks, I do it because there’s a decent chance it reduces community spread and it’s not really inconvenient at all.</p>

        <p>It's very comparable PRECISELY because it's a form of oppression. This is made even worse by the fact that the mask is pointless from a medical point of view. THE MASK DOES NOT DECREASE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS! It even says so in the box!</p>

"In  this review, we did not find evidence to support a protective effect   of personal protective measures or environmental measures in reducing   influenza transmission. Although these measures have mechanistic support   based on our knowledge of how influenza is transmitted from person to   person, randomized trials of hand hygiene and face masks have not   demonstrated protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza, with 1   exception (<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article#r18"><em>18</em></a>)."</p>

        <p>Once again, from the editorial in the study that the article is based on stating, in your words, that “masks harm children” </p>
<p>“EDITORIAL NOTE:
This study is based on a survey regarding the adverse effects of mask wearing in children. Due to multiple limitations, this study cannot demonstrate a causal relationship between mask wearing and the reported adverse effects in children. Most of the respondents were parents, and the survey was distributed preferentially in social media forums that, according to the authors, “criticize the government’s corona protection measures in principle”. The limitations of the study include sampling bias, reporting bias, and confounding bias as well as lack of a control group. The use of masks, together with other precautionary measures, significantly reduces the spread of COVID-19 and is considered safe for children over the age of two years old.”</p>
<p>Please read that last sentence and then go ahead and quote this as a source to support your stance... muppet.</p>

<li>An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the <strong>University of Illinois</strong>  concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as  self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control).

<p>This from the European CDC:</p>
<p>“In areas with community transmission of COVID-19, wearing a medical or non-medical face mask is recommended in confined public spaces and can be considered in crowded outdoor settings.
• For people vulnerable to severe COVID-19, such as the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions, the use of medical face masks is recommended as a means of personal protection in the above-mentioned settings.
• In households, the use of medical face masks is recommended for people with symptoms of COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19 and for the people who share their household”</p>

<li>There is<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798"> increasing evidence</a> that the novel coronavirus is transmitted, at least in indoor settings, not only by droplets but also by <strong>smaller aerosols</strong>.  However, due to their large pore size and poor fit, cloth masks cannot  filter out aerosols (see video analysis below): over 90% of aerosols <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">penetrate or bypass</a> the mask and fill a medium-sized room within minutes.</li>
<li>The <strong>WHO</strong> admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 <a href="https://swprs.org/who-mask-study-seriously-flawed/">mask policy update</a> was due not to new evidence but <a href="https://twitter.com/deb_cohen/status/1282244773030633473">“political lobbying”</a>:  “We had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the  evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political  lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.” (D. Cohen, BBC  Medical Corresponent).</li>
<li>To date, the only <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT)</strong>  on face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting found  no statistically significant benefit (see above). However, three major  journals <a href="https://swprs.org/the-suppressed-danish-mask-study/">refused to publish</a> this study, delaying its publication by several months.</li>
<li>An analysis by the <strong>US CDC</strong> found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4">85% of people</a>  infected with the new coronavirus reported wearing a mask “always”  (70.6%) or “often” (14.4%). Compared to the control group of uninfected  people, always wearing a mask did not reduce the risk of infection.</li>
<li>Researchers from the University of Minnesota found that the <strong>infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2</strong> is just 300 virions (viral particles), whereas a single minute of normal speaking may generate <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2030886">more than 750,000 virions</a>, making cloth face masks unlikely to prevent an infection.</li>
<li><strong>Japan</strong>, despite its widespread use of face masks, experienced its <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/">most recent influenza epidemic</a>  with more than 5 million people falling ill just one year ago, in  January and February 2019. However, unlike SARS-CoV-2, the influenza  virus is easily transmitted by children, too.</li>
<li><strong>Austrian scientists</strong> found that the introduction, retraction and re-introduction of a face mask mandate in Austria had <a href="https://corona-transition.org/maskenpflicht-brachte-in-osterreich-keinerlei-messbaren-nutzen">no influence</a> on the coronavirus infection rate. Moreover, German analysts found that <strong>N95/FFP2 masks</strong>, too, had <a href="https://twitter.com/DaFeid/status/1366318079228149761">no influence</a> on the infection rate.</li>
<li>In the <strong>US state of Kansas</strong>, the 90 counties without  mask mandates had lower coronavirus infection rates than the 15 counties  with mask mandates. To hide this fact, the Kansas health department <a href="https://sentinelksmo.org/more-deception-kdhe-hid-data-to-justify-mask-mandate/">tried to manipulate</a> the official statistics and data presentation.</li>
<li>Contrary to common belief, studies <strong>in hospitals</strong> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736">found that</a> the wearing of a medical mask by surgeons during operations <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493952/pdf/annrcse01509-0009.pdf">didn’t reduce</a> post-operative bacterial wound infections in patients.</li>
<li>During the notorious <strong>1918 influenza pandemic</strong>, the use of cloth face masks among the general population was widespread and in some places mandatory, but they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/">made no difference</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Asian countries</strong> with low covid infection rates, most of them neighboring China, benefited not from face masks but mainly from <a href="https://swprs.org/the-zero-covid-countries/">early border closures</a>. This is confirmed by Scandinavian countries Norway, Finland and Denmark, which didn’t introduce mask mandates but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2020/05/08/denmark-norway-relax-coronavirus-restrictions-but-borders-remain-closed/">closed borders early</a> and saw very low covid infection and death rates, too.</li>
<li>German scientists found that in and on <strong>N95 (FFP2) masks</strong>, the novel coronavirus remains infectious <a href="https://fh-muenster.de/gesundheit/forschung/forschungsprojekte/moeglichkeiten-und-grenzen-der-eigenverantwortlichen-wiederverwendung-von-ffp2-masken-im-privatgebrauch/index.php">for several days</a>,  much longer than on most other materials, thus significantly increasing  the risk of infection by touching or reusing such masks.</li>

        <p>So now that you've looked up what an aerosol is, assuming you put in the effort to actually read the definition, do you understand how a mask limits the amount that escape your mouth and nose?</p>
<p>You're going to need to provide evidence of asymptomatic people not spreading the virus because that has been a major factor of how this virus has been spreading. Also it's funny how you suddenly trust fauci.</p>
<p>I'll stay in reality but you can continue to play pretend with your friends here and act like you're more than just selfish idiots who have dug in too far to realize they've been lied to so more people can die for the sake of corporations.</p>

        <p>You can inform them that it is the first mRNA “vaccine” that was rushed out in under a year, has no liability for damages, doesn’t prevent you from getting or spreading covid, and didn’t go through standard testing protocols. If they still think there is a problem with being skeptical, then you really don’t need to worry, because they lack all faculty of thought.</p>

        <p>&rt;If you think the entire world is forever under a dystopian fascist rule with private companies performing genetic experiments on us you're not a doomer? Because it sounds pretty bleak to me.</p>
<p>I want to think this is an honest question.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the "2 years to flattten the curve", the "vaccine" has not only been rushed but it hasn't been approved by the FDA (since it was only authorized to be used as an emergency) but not only that, certain countries have even discontinued different versions of said "vaccine" due to the high mortality rate and adverse side effects. Then there's also the the fact that some countries want/have a vaccine passport, which punishes you for refusing to take this experimental treatment and on top of that, you are on your own because nobody would be liable in case this exerimental mRNA gene therapy causes some serious consequences in your body. Is there any reason to think the "vaccines" work or that thy are not trying to control us? </p>
<p>While I don't fully get the whole concept behind the word "doomer" it boils down to the following: You only claim things are ebad (for example, the virus being incredibly deadly, hospitals being overcrowded, symptoms being awful, so on and so forth) because that's what you were told to do even if pretty much everything around you is just the opposite of what you were told to say/think. There's  a picture somewhere (on this sub I believe) that portrays this concept perfectly. </p>
<p>So the doomer is dressed in a raincoat and is holding an umbrella (inside of their own home, in front of a TV) because the TV is telling him the weather is awful and the rain is just brutal, however, if you look around the character you can notice that it's not only not raining but that the weather is just fine outside and people are safe and sound. So essentially they are the ones spreading doom wherever they go because they are just following the narrative.</p>

        <p>Doctors have practice data - ie what happened when I gave a patient something. Although they are generally experts relating to a medical issue, virus infection is not something they study day in day out. They see patients with a virus, maybe run a test to see what it is, and advise a treatment plan.</p>
<p>If a doctor gave every flu patient chocolate ice cream and they all recovered, that doctor would say that chocolate ice cream cures the flu..</p>
<p>The only problem is a control because we all know that your body fights viruses and most of the time you don't need intervention. If a study was done, properly, a Randomized Controlled Trial, the study would find that chocolate ice cream has no causation for treating viruses and is not useful.</p>
<p>The doctor would scream bloody murder about how chocolate ice cream works because their experience validates it. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>This is why you get hit constantly with people challenging your premise that doctors say masks don't work, because doctors aren't performing RCTs to test that hypotheses. The beauty of RCTs is that they are challenged, checked, peer-reviewed, and done over and over to validate the results. If more sensitive equipment becomes available and the results change, the conclusion changes as well. Check the studies, as you clearly are well-read, and see for yourself what the data shows and the conclusions made from it. </p>
<p>Masks won't protect you 100%, but wide spread (and proper) use reduces the spread and the severity of the infection when it fails. Hopefully soon there won't be any need for them as hospitalizations go down and we return to normal.</p>
<p>If you need some studies let me know, I'll happily drop some for you but I suspect you'll want to find your own so you know I"m not just cherry picking them.</p>

        <p>Wow what an amazing argument you put forward!</p>
<p>I'm going to assume you don't actually care to engage in good faith consideration of the benefits of widespread public mask usage, if you are blithely pretending there is an absence of scientific data reinforcing the assertion that widespread public mask usage reduces the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 still. I'll still post this for anyone else who follows along later.</p>
<p>Most of the linked studies are from last year or older. Newer information more specific to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is certainly available.</p>
<p>Look at the Davies study section "Prevention of Droplet and Particle Dissemination When Coughing" and the van der Sande section on Outward Protection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic">Testing the Efficacy Of Homemade Masks, Davies et al, 2013</a></p>
<p>&rt;The median-fit factor of the homemade masks was one-half that of the surgical masks. Both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers, although the surgical mask was 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the homemade mask…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/">Professional and Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure, van der Sande et al, 2008</a></p>
<p>&rt;Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323085/">SARS Transmission, Risk Factors, and Prevention in Hong Kong, Lau, et al, 2004</a></p>
<p>&rt;In addition, frequent mask use in public venues, frequent hand washing, and disinfecting the living quarters were significant protective factors…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5153448/">Effectiveness of vaccination and wearing masks on seasonal influenza, Uchida et al, 2016</a></p>
<p>&rt;The result showed that vaccination (odds ratio 0.866, 95% confidence interval 0.786–0.954) and wearing masks (0.859, 0.778–0.949) had significant protective association.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23505369/">Influenza virus aerosols in human exhaled breath, Milton et al, 2013</a></p>
<p>&rt;Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold reduction in viral aerosol shedding</p>
<p><a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v1">Face Masks Against COVID-19: An Evidence Review, Howard et al. 2020, preprint</a></p>
<p>&rt;Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high. The decreased transmissibility could substantially reduce the death toll and economic impact while the cost of the intervention is low. Thus we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07353">Calibrated Intervention and Containment of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Tian et al., 2020 preprint</a></p>
<p>&rt;…if 70% of the general public wear masks and contact tracing is conducted at 60% efficiency within a 4-day time frame, epidemic growth will be flattened in the hardest hit countries. Even with masks at a moderate efficacy of 50%, reduction of the transmission rate can be substantial when practised by the whole population.</p>
<p>Since last year,  more data has been collected. Widespread public mask usage is one of the cheapest and effective ways of reducing spread of respiratory diseases, such as Covid-19.</p>

        <p>Your mask lunacy has debunked repeatedly.  It's a waste of time to keep showing you doomers the actual measured data because you're enamored with the idea of magical doilies that violate all known natural laws and miraculously filter things they are incapable of filtering.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798"> increasing evidence</a> that the novel coronavirus is transmitted, at least in indoor settings, not only by droplets but also by <strong>smaller aerosols</strong>.  However, due to their large pore size and poor fit, cloth masks cannot  filter out aerosols (see video analysis below): over 90% of aerosols <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">penetrate or bypass</a> the mask and fill a medium-sized room within minutes.</li>
<li>The <strong>WHO</strong> admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 <a href="https://swprs.org/who-mask-study-seriously-flawed/">mask policy update</a> was due not to new evidence but <a href="https://twitter.com/deb_cohen/status/1282244773030633473">“political lobbying”</a>:  “We had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the  evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political  lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.” (D. Cohen, BBC  Medical Corresponent).</li>
<li>To date, the only <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT)</strong>  on face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting found  no statistically significant benefit (see above). However, three major  journals <a href="https://swprs.org/the-suppressed-danish-mask-study/">refused to publish</a> this study, delaying its publication by several months.</li>
<li>An analysis by the <strong>US CDC</strong> found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4">85% of people</a>  infected with the new coronavirus reported wearing a mask “always”  (70.6%) or “often” (14.4%). Compared to the control group of uninfected  people, always wearing a mask did not reduce the risk of infection.</li>
<li>Researchers from the University of Minnesota found that the <strong>infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2</strong> is just 300 virions (viral particles), whereas a single minute of normal speaking may generate <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2030886">more than 750,000 virions</a>, making cloth face masks unlikely to prevent an infection.</li>
<li><strong>Japan</strong>, despite its widespread use of face masks, experienced its <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/">most recent influenza epidemic</a>  with more than 5 million people falling ill just one year ago, in  January and February 2019. However, unlike SARS-CoV-2, the influenza  virus is easily transmitted by children, too.</li>
<li><strong>Austrian scientists</strong> found that the introduction, retraction and re-introduction of a face mask mandate in Austria had <a href="https://corona-transition.org/maskenpflicht-brachte-in-osterreich-keinerlei-messbaren-nutzen">no influence</a> on the coronavirus infection rate. Moreover, German analysts found that <strong>N95/FFP2 masks</strong>, too, had <a href="https://twitter.com/DaFeid/status/1366318079228149761">no influence</a> on the infection rate.</li>
<li>In the <strong>US state of Kansas</strong>, the 90 counties without  mask mandates had lower coronavirus infection rates than the 15 counties  with mask mandates. To hide this fact, the Kansas health department <a href="https://sentinelksmo.org/more-deception-kdhe-hid-data-to-justify-mask-mandate/">tried to manipulate</a> the official statistics and data presentation.</li>
<li>Contrary to common belief, studies <strong>in hospitals</strong> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736">found that</a> the wearing of a medical mask by surgeons during operations <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493952/pdf/annrcse01509-0009.pdf">didn’t reduce</a> post-operative bacterial wound infections in patients.</li>
<li>During the notorious <strong>1918 influenza pandemic</strong>, the use of cloth face masks among the general population was widespread and in some places mandatory, but they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/">made no difference</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Asian countries</strong> with low covid infection rates, most of them neighboring China, benefited not from face masks but mainly from <a href="https://swprs.org/the-zero-covid-countries/">early border closures</a>. This is confirmed by Scandinavian countries Norway, Finland and Denmark, which didn’t introduce mask mandates but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2020/05/08/denmark-norway-relax-coronavirus-restrictions-but-borders-remain-closed/">closed borders early</a> and saw very low covid infection and death rates, too.</li>
<li>German scientists found that in and on <strong>N95 (FFP2) masks</strong>, the novel coronavirus remains infectious <a href="https://fh-muenster.de/gesundheit/forschung/forschungsprojekte/moeglichkeiten-und-grenzen-der-eigenverantwortlichen-wiederverwendung-von-ffp2-masken-im-privatgebrauch/index.php">for several days</a>,  much longer than on most other materials, thus significantly increasing  the risk of infection by touching or reusing such masks.</li>

        <p>My wife is a real believer, so have to walk on eggshells with her on this topic.  But yesterday she was listing off for me all of the people she knew who've had adverse reactions to the vaccine.  One person had to be hospitalized.   I asked her "And how many people do you know who've contracted covid?"  She changed the subject because she knew the answer was "Zero."</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but I don't trust this game of telephone. 
How many is "all of the people" and what are "adverse reactions?". FYI the fever, achiness, sore arm etc are not adverse reaction and are expected with many vaccines. Every person's body is different and when your immune system kicks in creating antibodies and mounting a defense it presents symptoms in some people.<br>
What was the person hospitalized for and how is it related the vaccine? 
Last I checked the numbers over 76 million people vaccinated and there were 1300 reported deaths following the vaccine but none have been linked to the vaccine. That's just statistics with that many people. A certain amount of people die every day. Some will die shortly after the vaccine. That is just fact. That does mean it caused it.
Let's say for the sake of argument though every single one of those people did die because of the vaccine. From the data we have, if 76 million people catch the virus, how many of those will die as a result of catching the virus? I'll let you look that up on your own because if you actually value fact and truth you will and you'll find it is orders of magnitude more than 1300.</p>

        <p>Maybe you should talk to an actual vaccine scientist instead of peddling propaganda. It wasn't "rushed". An emergency use authorization means that they go to the front of the line with the FDA, even with dedicated groups in a rolling approval instead having gated approvals every step of the way having to wait in line with 100s of other groups. That's why it normally takes longer. Not because they've done less work or shown any less levels of data and safety than when they have to wait in line and it takes longer.
Anyone believing the vaccine is a magic shield against covid is wrong however the vaccine does prevent illness (meaning if you get exposed you may not get sick at all when you would have without it) and severity of illness meaning if you get exposed and do get sick your symptoms may be lesser and time sick lessened. It absolutely is preventative it just is not a full immunity cure. 
I could provide sources if you're interested and I invite you to share yours if you have any. Otherwise that's all I'm going to say.</p>

        <p>All of this can be explained with the fact that the vaccine was needed ASAP. Apart from it not stopping you from spreading or getting it. Which no vaccine does. It just makes it easier for you to survive it. I have read through the side effects and there is nearly nothing serious, the worst being if you got a bit of pain at the point of injection, maybe some tiredness. These are all nothing compared to having the actual virus, which if we did not have the vaccine you would get eventually.</p>
<p>Sure, say you are skeptical, but do some reasurch about it instead of just saying 'nah not for me' like the selfish prick it makes you look like.</p>

        <p>If you've already had the virus then its fair if you don't want the vaccine because you have effectively already had one. If a person who has not had the vaccine was infected with the virus they would be infectiose for more than a week. If a vaccinated person was attacked they would be infections for maybe a day. That is why younger people need to get vaccinated, so that they are infectiose for a shorter amount of time so that the spread is slower. Older people need to get vaccinated because to them its deadly. Do you see how you are selfish now?</p>
<p>I'm not afraid at all, I'm 17, the virus will be nothing to me. But if I get it, I won't be able to go home because there are people in my home who are immunocompromised, like thousands of others in the country. They can be any age, if they get infected, there is a very high chance they will die. So its my responsibility to not get infected so that they don't catch it and die. Its that simple. You are selfish.</p>

        <p>Source is that it is common logic, You are infectiose for the whole time you are infected, you are infected for less time if you have the vaccine as your body fights it off quicker than if you had not had the vaccine. This aint QED.</p>

        <p>You believe that a type of medication used for the first time on humans isn't "the first," when it is. You believe that the mRNA technology studied on animals put into use to create a vaccine in less than a year isn't rushed, when it was. </p>
<p>You believe that any side effects will be mild and last a maximum of two days? There are no facts that claim that, so that's faith on your part.</p>
<p>When something has been tested for a few years and has been proven to be safe and effective, I'll consider taking it if necessary. But I'm not Big Pharma's guinea pig.</p>

        <p>I mean it's not the first vaccine for a rna virus, for the flu as an exemple.It wasn't rushed or better we do all the necessary to make it safe faster.I was wrong in not providing document,yes,but they are publicly available and backed up by the studies of schools and university.I didn't say mild,they aren't,it makes you feel very dolorant,but the vaccine isn't dangerous.I'm ok with not wanting the vaccine now,but the mask off shit isn't a good idea</p>

        <p>It's the first one to be USED ON HUMANS, as I said. Back in 2019, Moderna started Phase 1 testing on humans for an mRNA flu vaccine, but they knew that they had years of testing ahead before it would be approved for general use. After all, early testing phases are only used to determine efficacy and immediate adverse effects. The later phases both confirm those results and look for more long-term effects.</p>
<p>You have no idea what long-term effects will result from the use of this "vaccine." No one does. And as long as acceptance of the shot is voluntary, I have no problem with the global population being used as volunteers in the Phase 4 testing.</p>
<p>When someone can prove that a simple piece of cloth can actually reduce, control, or stop the spread of any virus, that's when I'll listen. But real-world evidence shows no benefit.</p>

        <p>It's not the first on human either?the flu vaccine has been going and changing for more than 70 years.there has never been any long term effects of any vaccine.Sure we don't know,maybe only the coronavirus will have it,but the general consensum agrees  that it isn't even remotely a problem.Mask works there have been plenty of study of different type.The most famous of wich is the hamster one.Obviously they aren't a 100%  protection.the classic flat one protects others and not you,and the "beak" ones are the one that protects you and others.The mechanism is simple,the mask stops the droplet from your mouth,they are the one that carries viruses.it can't work perfectly but wearing mask and respecting the 6 foot rule the possibility of it spreading are mininal. Hope i was clear. If not feel free to ask.</p>

        <p>We're speaking in circles.</p>
<p>There has never been an mRNA vaccine used on humans before now. By definition, these are the first ones.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, one of the swine flu vaccines had a risk of narcolepsy, so what you said was a lie. EVERY medication carries a risk of short- or long-term effects. Most vaccines have short-term effects like fever, chills, or pain at the injection site, but since those symptoms are much milder and safer to the body than the disease the vaccines fight, they are worth the risk.</p>
<p>You can chant your "droplet" mantra all you want, but pieces of cloth are not magic breath filters. They don't stop virus from escaping my nose and mouth any more than they stop virus from entering yours. They may inhibit droplets from coughs and sneezes from shooting straight out, but they do so by shooting the droplets out the sides, top and bottom. And they are not proven to filter breath, either inhaled or exhaled. (By the way, have you ever seen anyone's glasses fog up when wearing a mask? What you see is droplet condensation. If that person wasn't wearing glasses, the droplets would continue to float upward into the surrounding air, waiting for the next person to inhale the invisible cloud.)</p>
<p>I'll follow the advice I've followed all my life: cough or sneeze into either my elbow or tissues, wash my hands frequently, and stay away from people if I'm sick. These actions are proven to be effective.</p>

        <p>Yes?no one said mask works 100% there is a certain area in wich the virus travels when not stopped that is limited by the mask.They aren't invincible shieldes,they are piece of cloth designed to do the best job they can do.That's why we have the 6 foot rule. I think we were talking of different things on the vaccine for rna virus.And i agree that i didn't aknowledge that flu case.That doesn't mean vaccine are lethal,I suggest not taking them now if feeling scared of it,it's reasonable,the vaccine isn't perfect and some people may have worse reaction to it than others.So it's better leaving them to people more endangered.The vaccine were tested btw, by volounteers.</p>

        <p>I don't claim that they don't work perfectly. I claim that there is no proof that they control viral spread, particularly when worn by people who aren't sick.</p>
<p>If there is no proof that they are effective, they should not be mandated. People who wish to protect themselves can take whatever precautions they choose.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is definitely not traditional, but I absolutely consider it a religion/cult at this point. It requires absolute belief, shames and attacks dissenters, and is unwilling to listen to any criticism. Fauci and other figure heads are their priests. Their doctrine is “science” which cannot be questioned (the antithesis of true science), and they are willing to use violence to further their ideology.</p>

        <p>The original reason muslim women wear the veil once they are married, is so that other men are less likely to hit on them.</p>
<p>If you wanted to say, stop people reproducing, because maybe you felt the population was too high, ensuring people can’t see each other’s faces and get horny, why not make them stay away from each other and cover their faces?</p>
<p>And make sure they’re terrified of an invisible threat that you must believe in, much like an all powerful god or... I don’t know, a virus that flies through the air.</p>

Just warning you maybe you should leave if you’re not looking to associate with close-minded straw-manning bigots.

        <p>Based on the number of upvotes those types of posts and comments get I’d have to disagree with you. And while it is good to be skeptical of things, this sub is not about that. They say they are, but they’re not. So many posts full of misinformation that the members all seem to believe blindly. You can do what you want but if I were you I’d try to find a sub more in line with your values, or if there isn’t one then make one</p>

        <p>I'm genuinely curious with the people in this sub. Do most of you believe COVID-19 is a hoax, or that most governments have acted too stringently dealing with it, that masks are useless, or something else I'm not understanding?</p>

        <p>I would say that the general consensus around here is that the virus is real, and that governments have acted way too heavy handed in their dealing with it. We have no problem with masks as a recommendation, even though it is mostly just to make people feel safe. The problem is the enforcement of these policies for over a year, when we have all seen by now that there really isn’t much to be afraid of. There is a 99.8% survival rate, and we all know they have been cooking the books to make the virus seem much more deadly than it actually is.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the respectful comment. My viewpoint is that even if the United States' continuous handling of coronavirus has been too strict (which I agree has some issues), it will always be the best course of action to err on the side of caution, taking a prophylactic stance. Of course this is all on a spectrum, so I respect all of your opinions. </p>
<p>However, I would say that this attitude of wanting to return to normal without going through the proper courses of action (e.g. New Zealand) is not really beneficial to ending this pandemic. In China, there's a proverb where a farmer, in an effort to have his plants grow faster, pulls them up slightly out of the ground so that they appear taller. In the morning, the plants are dead, and the farmers efforts have been counter-productive. In my eyes, this is how I see this sub: trying to achieve something all of us want but doing so in a dubious manner. </p>
<p>Let me know what you think. I hope not to offend anyone with my words; I'm just interested in your viewpoints.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in educating yourself, here’s a really good article that reviews the literature on masks, distancing, and eye protectors for COVID (as well as SARS and MERS). I know the large amount of literature can be daunting so in this one they’ve already read them for you and done a nice summary. If you want further reading, you can use the works cited section of this paper to find the original papers it was based on. There’s also lots of resources out there to show you how to navigate research databases to find more scientific sources</p>

        <p>How can people still be in support of burqas?  Burqas are evidence that women in the western world have it so much better than some of these eastern girls.  It would be different if wearing a mask or burqa was optional in some places, but in there not optional in a lot of places.  I don't care if anybody does or doesn't wear a mask or burqa, it's about being able to live wear it's not required by law to do either.</p>

        <p>Hi I am not going counter the whole anti mask and vaccines, but about the muslim women covering themselves up. I need to counter that as I personally am not a muslim however I was intrested in learning more about their religion and have done lots of research into this subject. Muslim women aren’t forced to wear a niqab or a hijab, however they chose to, people in their religion don’t wear either if they don’t chose to. For many of them it is a way to be closer to their God, one person even said it was being surrounded by her God, protecting her like armor. It also allows them to be more modest, and be judged by their personality and not by their looks. The aforementioned women married without her husband ever seeing her face, he fell in love with her personality not her body. Again it is their choice whether they cover their hair, face or whole body, it is not the law, nor is it because their husband forces them to. The mask is to protect people's lives, the niqab and hijab is to help them to grow closer to their God, and to protect their modesty! If you want to learn more from a person who wears a hijab try “Saleh Family” and if you want to learn more about the niqab try “Ninja Mommy”. They both have short, but informative videos on misconceptions on Muslims and make it fun, informative and non-judgmental! Please check them out!</p>

        <p>Nice try in your radical Islam brainwashing comment over here, but your comment is an utter BS to say the least.</p>
<p>Women in most Arabian countries where they have the Sharia law don't have any saying whatsoever if they want or don't want to wear their coverings. Same goes for tourist women in those countries BTW.  If a girl in Iraq for example doesn't wears it ,she'll be severely punished in public if not executed. Women in most countries under the Islam law will also not be allowed to leave their home nor see any male (even relatives) wo her husband. It goes as far as shading the windows on lower parts of the apartment blocks so someone can't see them accidentally so ,so much about how much choice they have in their modesty. </p>
<p>Islam is the greatest plague there is for the women's rights and that's all what there is to it.</p>

        <p>As someone who has been to Saudi Arabia (right before this covid bs, actually), I can say definitively say that women there are NOT forced to wear niqabs (face coverings). In the year that I was there, I interacted with many saudi women. Some wore the face covering, some did not. I'm sure there's always societal or familial pressure, but there's no law dictating that women's faces had to be covered. They do ask that women wear loose, duster type coats over their normal clothes, just because that's the cultural dress. I stayed in one of the more conservative cities im saudi and no, not once was there a stoning or beheading, especially not of a woman. I don't think we can transplant western values into other cultures and ask that they adapt to us.</p>

        <p>&rt; . I'm sure there's always societal or familial pressure, but there's no law dictating that women's faces had to be covered</p>
<p>Well there was no law on it in the countries i've been either (ASF AS IK) i never said there was ,that's why i said i was in the "modest" places ,but i believe that in many places there is. But ,even if there is no law on it in some countries, you prolly realize that  the "family" pressure in some more conservative families ends up in "honor killing" many times and of course the perpetrators rarely see any justice.  Not saying it's like that in all the cases, but the data shows it happens quite a lot ,even in countries like Turkey and then you have those fuckers wanting to enter the EU, so yeah keep the Islam out of Europe. It's a fact that it's the most hostile religion towards women ever.</p>
<p>&rt;  I don't think we can transplant western values into other cultures and ask that they adapt to us.</p>
<p>Interesting ,that they certainly are free to  try their very best to get the West to adopt to their "values" when they crawl into the Europe or US as the economic migrants tho. I've been to Switzerland's ghetto and it literally felt like Iraq at times. I've heard that French and UK's No-Go zones aren't that much different either.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply! I wish I could go and see how everything is with my own eyes, but COVID isn’t the only barrier unfortunately! Your comment is the first one to agree with me so thank you again! I’m glad you had a positive experience and I hope that women are not forced into anything, but I was hoping to give people more information than just one side of the story! And thank you for adding more information and experience to this discussion!</p>

        <p>This girl I worked with in a healthcare profession school said she was offered to work in a country for a few years where there was Sharia law and they were going to forgive a lot of her student loans.</p>
<p>I remember she said she can work without a burka on in the hospital but has to make sure it's on outside. She said she's almost considering it but poked fun at how it could fly off in the middle of walking from work.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your reply, I’m not even going to try and change your opinion, there is obviously no changing it right now. All I am going to say is do a bit more research, ninja mommy has lots of videos on this topic if you want to see this from a Muslim’s point of view. I can’t say for sure one way or another as I have never been there. If you have please tell me, but if all your info comes from the internet and all you see is the horror stories and the bad stuff, I don’t understand how come you are on a thread designated to discuss those horror stories about COVID. Again thank you for your reply and please help me gain more information about this topic!</p>

<p>Well as you've said you never been in any of those countries ,so you can't say shit apart from what you saw on Yt. I've actually been to Egypt and Tunisia (one of the more modest places) and i've seen how they treat women down there with my own eyes. I've seen a girl being hit by a guy in the middle of the street and no one blinked an eye at it and again that was in the "modest" Islam countries ,so i can only imagine how they roll in the less modest places. </p>
<p>And forget about Africa or Asia ,even so called European Muslims in Bosnia or Albania treat women like shit, i've been there too as i've traveled a lot. And i saw and heard about it.  This is all coming from my first hand experiences in Muslim countries ,so i don't need any Ninja Mommies to explain to me that what i've saw was not real as i have pretty good grounds to believe it is real, coming from my experiences ,not to mention on what objective sources online say.</p>
<p>Iran was a moderate country as you've described in the 70ies ,before the Taliban revolution, i'll give you that, but unfortunately those days are long gone for the majority of Arab world.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your reply, it’s true most of my info has come from the internet that’s all I have access to right now unfortunately. Thanks for letting me know about your travels, your right there is definitely oppression and abuse. There is everywhere unfortunately, but my main reason for this comment was simple. I don’t want women like me who want to follow their religion and get closer to their God to get hate. They do simply because of experiences like that, of people who saw the worst of what their religion and culture can be not what is beautiful. I am Christian and I have to be careful how I tell people that because people take it to mean that I am pro life and anti LGBQ+. That I’m going to start screaming at them and telling them they are going to hell. Not what I see which is a relationship with my saviour and a father who loves me no matter what. My goal is not to paint everything black and white but to show people every single colour in the rainbow. My comment was to give people access to information of people who love their religion and the way they dress. Everyone has heard the women can’t go anywhere by themselves story, but I want to show people the rest of that book. If all everyone heard was that point of view a culture and religion that means a lot to people gets hated and turned on them instead. Obviously the way those countries behave towards violence against women is wrong, but there is more to the story. I hope this sheds some light on why I commented in the first place!</p>

        <p>&rt; I am Christian and I have to be careful how I tell people that because people take it to mean that I am pro life and anti lesbian.</p>
<p>May i ask who thinks that? I'm from Slavic Europe and my country is predominately atheist ,although traditionally Christian  ,but no one would think you are anti lesbian or pro life ,just for saying you're Christian. Christianity is our official religion and is pretty well respected around here. </p>
<p>I myself am an Atheist but i have no problem with religious Christian or Catholic ppl as long as they don't try to brainwash me with their religious views. </p>
<p>And sure ,not everything is black and white anywhere ,i'm not saying that ,but there is a lot of oppression and violence under the name of the God and Especially in Islam, which is the most hateful of religions IMO. Don't take my word for it, just check it out yourself. Not to say there aren't violent Atheists out there either,tho. I just really hate violence towards weaker ,that's why i shared my POV with you. And yes if a girl wants to be fully covered by her own choice that's one thing, but mandating it is wrong in my book.</p>

        <p>I completely agree! </p>
<p>My teacher and my class were having a awesome discussion about abortion, but as soon as she asked if I was religious and I said yes she immediately shut down the topic for fear of offending me! I am from Canada and the United States. Unfortunately Christianity is not as well respected here (from my experience), there is still many believers, but because of the loud ones who shout and complain my religion can be hated. I have a bisexual classmate who has dealt with far too many people telling her she is going to hell because of who she loves. Even people in my own church I avoid talking about certain topics with them (despite considering them a part of my family) simply because they don’t believe in the LGBQ+ community. </p>
<p>I wish everyone thought of Christianity like that but unfortunately not. My church is currently doing a series about how people see the church, they asked people on Facebook to fill in the blank for Christianity is<strong><em>_</em></strong> and most of what came back was hate and anger against the religion. My current church is very open and loving to everyone thankfully which is why I still continue to attend! Not all church’s are like that anymore, churches seem to be separating people instead of bringing them together!</p>
<p>Your 100% right there is violence and hatred because of religion no matter which one you are a part of. Christianity has more than its fair share as does Islam which is unfortunate, but people just find every reason to hate and start up violence! I don’t know how to stop the violence as it just seems to be a part of human nature, but if I can spread a bit of love and acceptance for people who need it, I want to do all I can! And I do not want anyone forced or mandated to cover up unless they wish to either. I apologize if I went a touch far, I hate violence as well and wanted to stand up for the Muslim women who loved their religion as well as the ones who are forced! I also have quite a few more people who got heated about my opinion and wanted to also explain my reason for the comment to everyone not just you! Thank you for sharing your point of view! It was very enlightening and helped give me a much deeper understanding of the situation in our world!</p>

        <p>Sure, NP. I've seen churches getting radicalized as well. It mainly happens in US in my experience as some Christians there seem to be more extreme as the country is more religious overall, but there are extremist churches all over the world prolly. It's the reason that, if i was religious i'd prolly just practice the religion for myself and i'd skip the church and group part. Who is a man to know what's the God about anyhow.</p>

<p>What about the many Muslim women living in western countries who willingly dress modestly rather than expose themselves. Rather Islam is the greatest thing for women's rights. At a time when women had virtually no rights Islam lifted them up high. </p>

        <p>I know in some countries they are free to choose, but there are other countries where it is mandated, and they will be punished if going in public without them. That is what this post is comparing to. Not all Muslim women, obviously.</p>

        <p>Based on the research I have done only one country actually forces women’s to wear a niqab, the rest call for modest dress and a hijab. Now obviously some men and families are toxic or over religious and ask that all women wear the niqab. But it is not law quite like you say, I get that some people are forced, but people are forced into things all the time. I don’t think it’s a necessarily a good thing, but it certainly isn’t a reason for you to stop wearing a mask. I was forced to go to church as a child and now have found a amazing family in my church. My sister is forced to cross the street to get over her fear of cars (only when safe of course). But again in only one country is it a law that they dress exactly like the photo shown. Also in previous comments you stated that Saudi’s Arabia it is law, but from what I can tell it seems to be they only ask for “decent and respectful” not a niqab hijab or abaya. I just don’t understand how a religious garment is being compared to being asked to wear a mask for the health and safety of everyone.</p>

        <p>Yes but a grown women can make her choice who she wants to be attached to and where she wants to live. Obviously not everyone can or will leave an oppressive or dangerous situation. However I don’t want everyone to look at a women wearing a hijab or a niqab and think oh no look at that poor women. Look how oppressed she is her husband is forcing her to wear a face covering. This post most likely comes from the US or another large country it’s main audience is also most likely from a similar country. This is adding to the problems a women faces if she chooses to wear a hijab in the US not helping spread acceptance and diversity. Besides you could argue that society in the US forces women to dress a certain way. Women all across the country are facing depression and anxiety based on their appearance. Facing criticism and rude comments because of their weight or their clothes. My best friend has told me far too many times how many people she has had comment on her weight and how much that adds to her depression and anxiety. It’s a massive problem across the world but posts like this make it harder for women to chose to accept and love their religion and culture in countries where they are able to chose what they believe in.</p>

        <p>Thanks for adding more information to this discussion! Your right, not everyone got the choice on whether or not they cover up or not, obviously I don’t want anyone to be forced to wear or do anything they don’t feel comfortable or happy wearing! Many women are forced due to societal pressure or from family, however I saw a post that stereotyped Muslim women. Into a depressed and oppressed person, however I want to break that stereotype and many more. My goal was to give people more info and another side to the story, I should have mentioned that not everyone’s experience will be the same! I hope she is happy and comfortable in her body, religion and clothes now, but I also hope that you will seek out more opinions and sides to this story! Don’t become part of one problem while trying to help another!</p>

        <p>I've had enough opinions from Islamic men cat-calling me (and my Iranian friend ) whores because we wouldn't cover our heads. And this was not in Pakistan or something, this was in Rosengård. She gets special mistreatment because they call her a traitor: in Islam apostasy is a death penalty crime.</p>
<p>I'm not doubting that some Muslim women enjoy wearing head covering religious clothing, some people also really enjoy wearing medical masks, or following strict kosher diets or whatever, but inevitably when things become moral norms they are FORCED on unwilling participants, and that is a big part of the theme of this whole subreddit.</p>

        <p>That is very accurate! I’m very sorry you and your friend had that experience! It shouldn’t happen anywhere for any reason, my main comment was because of women like I referenced. In America and Canada we have an opposite problem, people see someone with a head scarf and they think look at that poor woman. People see hate and sadness with a garment that brings only love for these women and I was hoping to clear that up. I also hate that  wearing a mask to help protect people is being compared to a religious garment that some women want and love to wear. I hope this clears everything up and I hope every country learns to accept and respect every persons opinion and choice! Thank you for your reply, it helps broaden my knowledge so I can make a better and more informed opinion in the future!</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply! My goal with this comment was to help spread support for Muslim women who chose to dress like this. It was also to help stop spreading this stereotype about women being forced to dress this way by law. I cant imagine how annoying it would be to have someone ask if you were being oppressed simple because you chose to be modest! You are 100% right tho! Extreme is not good for anyone, I hate that women are being forced to dress a certain way if it makes them uncomfortable or not happy. I long for a day when everyone can choose their own religion and clothing without being forced. The law part is also triggering as from what I know only one country actually forced women to dress exactly like the picture by law. Many others face societal and family pressures which isn’t any better, but the comparison used as way to stop people from using masks is what made me comment on this post! I hope this clears things up! Thanks for adding more information into this discussion!</p>

        <p>I know this is off topic, but I think it's important to note some things here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it is true that in most Arabic speaking countries neither hijab nor niqab are mandated by law</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some/many women choose to wear it even when not mandated by law</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not being mandated by law doesn't mean it's not forced. Think about it: we call it "forced" when the gov threatens to punish those who don't wear it. What if you believe that God will punish you if you don't wear it? Doesn't that make it equally forced? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>humans are good are rationalizing. A lot of times we think we are doing something for reason A while we're really doing it for B. Women claiming they are wearing it for modesty might think so, but would they still do it if they didn't think God might send them to hell if they didn't?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the rise of hijab correlated with the rise of political Islam a few decades ago (and there are early signs of the trend reversing as the general sentiment is moving away from political Islam). This makes me think it's not so innocent. Look at pictures/movies/videos of many Arabic speaking societies (especially outside Arabia, where hijab might actually be a cultural tradition) in the 50's and 60's and you will see that hijab was very rare. Did women back then not care about modesty or having an armor or whatever? or is there some very different dynamic happening here?</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>Not reasons that would affect someone else’s health. You’re taking my words out of context. But if you choose to not wear a mask, it puts people in danger who are at risk. It doesn’t matter if you agree, because it’s a danger to another person.</p>

        <p>Wasn’t that always the case with the flu? A virus that kills many more children than covid. Isn’t there always going to be potentially fatal viruses that can spread? Does that mean masks should be mandated until no one has the potential to get sick ever again? And all this is assuming masks work, which they do not. You can live your life in fear and take all necessary precautions, but your fear is not important to me, and I will live my life without a mask.</p>

        <p>Flu kills more children, but COVID-19 is overall more dangerous, especially to the at risk. First of all, yes there will always be some fatal virus somewhere. But this virus is easily transmitted and the only liberty you have to give up is to wear a mask out in public. As for masks not working, even if you don’t believe the peer reviewed studies that state that masks significantly reduce infection rates, common sense would dictate that coughing or sneezing would reduce germ transmission. Tl;dr: You want to kill your own grandma, fine. How about not mine when she’s in a store? And riddle me this: why don’t you complain about having to wear shirts in public? Same concept but it doesn’t save lives.</p>

        <p>That is true, but there are still a lot of stores where you can’t order or pickup, like clothing stores. Contrast that pickup and delivery system with just wearing a mask, and I don’t think that seems like such an unreasonable alternative.</p>

        <p>First of all, clothing was one example. For the most part, locking yourself inside for a year is not viable any way you put it.

        <p>First of all, that's the example you gave me.  And I haven't told anyone to lock themselves inside.  In fact, I haven't told anyone what to do at all.  <strong>You</strong> on the other hand have made it abundantly clear that you want to dictate to others what they should do.  Secondly, you're not making any <em>points</em> at all.  Everything you come up with I've been easily able to make a mockery of, and you know it.  Thirdly, why should <em>what</em> bother me?

The <strong><em>vast</em></strong> majority of us won't be dying from C-19, sorry if that disappoints you.  Fifth, you were never concerned about respiratory illnesses, <em>ever</em>, before, and you never wore a mask either, even though it was <em>possible</em> you could have contaminated someone.  So you are a gullible hypocrite.  Sixth, I avoided the name calling in order to have a discussion, but your 'argument' is so weak that you had to resort to it.

        <p>Alright. One, I’m saying that masks are an easy ALTERNATIVE to locking yourself inside. You still refuse to address any of my points, which I assume is because you can’t. I am also referring to masks bothering you. How does it hurt you to just wear a mask? I also think taking more precautions for COVID 19 is warranted due to the higher death toll, it’s not that I didn’t care before, before there wasn’t a pandemic.

        <p>Stop being afraid of death. We are all going to die someday. Demanding that we should be as afraid as you is selfish. We aren't making any demands of you, unlike you who is demanding that we give up our liberty in exchange for the illusion of temporary security. Not going to happen, no matter how hard you try to manipulate our emotions or virtue signal about "SaViNg LiVeS".</p>

        <p>I get that, but masks do indeed save lives and you aren’t giving up ‘liberty’ or some bullshit like that, it’s just a precaution. I’d say that is more selfish</p>

        <p>&rt;even if you don’t believe the peer reviewed studies that state that masks significantly reduce infection rates</p>
<p>They don't. </p>

"In this review, we did not find evidence to support a protective effect  of personal protective measures or environmental measures in reducing  influenza transmission. Although these measures have mechanistic support  based on our knowledge of how influenza is transmitted from person to  person, randomized trials of hand hygiene and face masks have not  demonstrated protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza, with 1  exception (<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article#r18"><em>18</em></a>)."</p>
<p>In fact, masks harm children:</p>

<p>And we now know that even N95 masks won't help:</p>

<p>"Germany:  Bavaria made N95/FFP2 masks mandatory (e.g. shops and public transports) from January, 18th. Other states in Germany didn't.  6 weeks later: N95 masks make no difference, the curves are absolutely identical."</p>

        <p>First of all, the study was conducted on influenza, which is different. Second of all, I don’t know if you only look at the parts you like to, but later in that very study it recommended them. Think about it like this; with the flu you notice the symptoms nearly 100% of the time, so you can just stay home until you are better. Covid, not only more dangerous, has a significant percentage of asymptomatic carriers.</p>

        <p>I know this is hard to stomache for you, but I base my opinion on scientific data and statistics. RAW DATA.<br>
not what the media makes out of it.</p>
<p>its available. you should take your time and look into it.</p>
<p>as a little example. german media is now making it sound HORRIBLE that B.1.1.7 is 10% (or so) of the current infections and that it hits younger people at a higher rate.<br>
uhhhhh, sounds dangerous, no?</p>
<p>in reality it does hit younger people more ofter right now.<br>
in reality the death numbers are rapidly declining too.<br>
in reality younger people have absolutely nothing to fear of this virus.  </p>
<p>the news that now younger people are getting infected instead of old people is actually a good one, but media makes it sound like its bad.  </p>
<p>only idiots deny scientific evidence.<br>
and only idiots look at just 1 metric.</p>

        <p>where did I deny that masks "work".<br>
in the sub its not about wether or not they work AT ALL and much more about to what degree they do.<br>
studies have shown that mask sort of work, but its largely neglectable.<br>
now, glasses (regular or sunglasses) also work to a similar degree according to a danish study.<br>
glasses and maks in conjunction have the largest effect. one which is bigger then the cumulative effect of both individually.</p>
<p>are you wearing your safety glasses?<br>
"the sciece" says you should.</p>

        <p>Claims sub is not about masks, then goes on a misinformed rant about how masks don't work.  </p>
<p>Like I said before I'm sorry easy science is hard for you to grasp.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7253999/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7253999/</a>  </p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24–0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11–0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36–0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials and observational studies.</p>

<p>lol I'm sorry is poor eyesight is not something that is contagious and can be spread to others. Like I said before I am sorry easy science is hard for you to grasp. Im sorry that you also cant read a scientific paper showing how masks work. Im sorry that you lack the critical thinking skills and education needed to do this. Im sorry for you in general.</p>
