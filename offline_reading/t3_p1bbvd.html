    <strong>Washington state mandates state employees to get the vax.</strong>
    <p><p>From: Governor Jay Inslee &lt;Governor.JayInslee@governor.wa.gov&rt;<br>

Subject: COVID-19 vaccine mandate  </p>
<p>Dear fellow state employee,  </p>
<p>I am writing today to let you know that I am requiring, by issuance of a proclamation, that all employees who work in state service for executive cabinet agencies must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by October 18, 2021, along with on-site contractors and volunteers. I have also mandated vaccination in some private health and long-term care services. I am taking this action pursuant to my emergency powers as Governor of the State of Washington found at RCW 43.06.220.  </p>
<p>This is not a decision I made lightly. I directed my staff to listen deeply to stakeholders, including labor organizations and department managers, to understand the many challenges facing state government as we respond to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of you are critical frontline workers and serve the public in positions which were not able to be performed remotely. You have been courageous beyond measure. Many of you shifted your approach and managed to achieve continuity of services from your homes in a way we have never asked of you before. This was hard and you persevered in providing excellent service to the state in extraordinarily difficult times while some of you experienced personal and professional losses due to the disease. This has been a grueling period for all.  </p>
<p>Now, we have the most effective tools available to operate safe workplaces and strengthen our commitment to the public – the COVID-19 vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines have been deemed safe and effective by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and comparable agencies around the world. Timing couldn’t be better because we are also facing a new strain of the disease that is more easily transmitted and more aggressive, especially for unvaccinated persons. Hospitals are jammed and health care personnel are exhausted.   </p>
<p>In arriving at my decision on how best to keep employees and customers safe, I considered permitting an employee to elect to test on a regular routine rather than mandating state employees be vaccinated against COVID-19, but ultimately determined that option was not suitable. I would like you to understand that thinking.  </p>
<p>First, we have implemented a routine testing process in many of our 24-7 facilities for unvaccinated staff and it has not prevented outbreaks. Unfortunately, outbreaks have continued to occur affecting employees, clients and families and we have lost dedicated staff. We owe it to those in our care and their families to do everything in our power to prevent these events. We owe it to you, our employees, and your families as well.Increasingly, the scale of a testing approach to across the entire state enterprise is costly and administratively burdensome. Sustaining a strategy which permits staff to test weekly would cost more than $66 million per year and still would not provide the protection in our work and care settings that we need. As we head into another surge of COVID-19 outbreaks across our state, driven by a rapidly increasing presence of the DELTA variant, it is more important than ever that we all act now to protect ourselves, our co-workers and our communities.  </p>
<p>I understand we may not agree, but I hope this letter has helped you to understand the thinking which led to this decision. I expect your agency leadership will be communicating with you on details and, where applicable, with exclusive bargaining representatives on the impacts of this mandate. Our agencies will also work diligently to support individuals with medical or religious beliefs to require accommodation from this directive. I am confident the time we have between now and October 18 is adequate to effectively implement this requirement and do what is needed to protect the safety of Washingtonians.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your compassion and service. Together, we can combat COVID-19.  </p>
<p>Very truly yours,  </p>
<p>Jay Inslee</p></p>

        <p>At least over here on the east side, there's always little getaways to Idaho. We're supposed to go to a wedding in Kent next summer, but that will probably be the last time we visit that area. Politics aside, Seattle is a shit hole.</p>

        <p>Same. Feels like there is no government mandate or restriction that could be too oppressive for my neighbors here. I feel totally out of touch with the majority here.</p>

        <p>Exactly. What happened to Washingtonians mostly having a "don't tread on me" attitude? I guess it's because of the mass influx of Californians spreading like cancer and ruining the politics here.  I've lived here my whole life and have noticed a stark change from how it was in the 90's even.</p>
