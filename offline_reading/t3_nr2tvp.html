    <strong>Family member announced that the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù for her and her immediate family means no contact with unvaccinated people</strong>
    <p><p>My cousin who is 37 sent an email to our entire family today. She has been dealing with an unknown liver issue, and Mass General believes it is one of the five extremely rare autoimmune diseases. Weirdly enough, she got the vaccine for COVID a month before she started getting testing done at hospitals. </p>
<p>She said that because of this she can not risk getting COVID because she can‚Äôt take medicine anymore since it will accelerate her disease. Her and her husband decided they can not be around anyone who has not been COVID vaccinated or flu vaccinated. They also have two children they want to protect since they are too young to get the vaccine. </p>
<p>I am torn because I don‚Äôt want to be separated from my family for life, but I refuse to get this vaccine. I am 23 and we don‚Äôt know what this does to fertility yet. Plus I have had both strains of covid and was fine, so I have the natural antibodies. I just don‚Äôt trust this and I would feel uncomfortable in my skin if I got it. But now I can never see my family again? And my decision is going to prevent my dad and mom from seeing them too? Feeling very depressed about this and stressed out and confused. How has our world changed so drastically for the worse :(</p></p>

        <p>Detach with love. It‚Äôs something we learned about in a recovery program I was in.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre allowed to cut people out of your life, forever, even if you still love them. That doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person. It just makes you someone that realizes the interactions you have with this person are harmful towards your health and well-being. 
Would you think of your situation differently if your cousin was pressuring you into using narcotics?</p>

        <p>It sounds like you just won't be seeing this cousin, her husband and kid again.  This is crazy but less crazy than a lot of people's fears- as least she has some legit illness. It doesn't have anything to do with your parents. It just means you can't see her until she comes to her senses and this stuff passes.</p>

        <p>I know you're sad and that this hurts, but in the long term, what would hurt more is giving up your integrity for the sake of pleasing others. Especially when they've fallen for a false narrative.</p>
<p>I've lost friends (no family yet) in regards to this topic and I sleep very well at night knowing I'm following my path. I wish the same to you.</p>
<p>Edit to add that I honestly believe this false narrative WILL NOT last forever. It's coming to a point sooner rather than later. Things are going to be exposed. So take strength in that.</p>

        <p>Well, she's nuts! Sorry, but that's the facts. Even if she never leaves her house ever again, at some point, hubby &amp; kids will need to go out in the scary real world. Where they may meet someone not jabbed. According to the "science", they are less likely to catch or have symptoms. So, NBD! If false, she might as well live too....</p>
<p>To ban your parents for your choice is full crazy, no stop. Again, they will have to live in the real world &amp; will meet others who are not jabbed. </p>
<p>Unless everyone is fully planning to stay inside 24/7 &amp; never EVER encounter another human being, they may meet someone not jabbed.</p>

        <p>Truly if you wanted to offer an accommodation, you could always request an antibody test, and when you get results ask when you should retest if at all. Then you could tell her your results, but what will help is just saying "No pressure, I miss you guys but I want you to make the best decision for you". I get what you're saying, because I think you empathize with her, it's been a heck of a year, she has a legitimate autoimmune disease and even if she's being overcautious I wouldn't blame her for literally not knowing what to trust anymore, yet you all miss each other. Rather than trying to talk each other into your differing viewpoints, I think just this act alone would show that you do want to respect her autonomy while retaining your own, and letting them process things at their pace. You're not obligated to do any of it but I think you're wondering if there's any compromises that can be made. We're in a similar boat with a family member who wants to vaccinate their diabetic son, but also doesn't want to. They're vaccinated. But with him, they're on the fence and have been taking every precaution and are just exhausted with all the limitations and back and forthisms. I'm not getting vaccinated, but I've been very supportive of all the limitations they're using just to play it safe. So we did zoom get togethers, virtual games, this year we gathered outdoors and they were fine without me wearing a mask because I've been social distancing and masking with an N95 (is it great, no, is it better than nothing, I think so). Kids weren't rushing up to cling on all of us anyway they wanted to run and play. But regardless when I made my plate of food or used their bathroom I put my mask on, not because they asked me to, but just to show that I DO support them, even if I am making different medical decisions.</p>

        <p>Just- if you don't want it. Don't get it. It sucks I know. I'm not the only one. My girlfriend doesn't want the vaccination either and she vowed not to get it. While her family isn't forcing her to get it- they might be getting it themselves. </p>
<p>This will surely be a divide amongst families and I KNOW it's hard. We must go through the pain though, the struggle, the emotions. Trust me, I know how you feel. </p>
<p>But I promise you- everything will be okay in the end. If it's not okay- it's not the end. </p>
