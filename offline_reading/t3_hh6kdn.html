    <strong>Anyone else refusing to go anywhere unless mask and social distancing are lifted?</strong>
    <p><p>I just heard about amusement parks reopening in Ocean City New Jersey. Can’t believe I actually got excited for this news, I was naive to think that they wouldn’t make everyone wear masks, operate at 50% capacity, and try to enforce social distancing. I’m going down there in July but there is no way I’m supporting or conforming to any of this garbage. I rather just not go than be uncomfortable.</p></p>

        <p>I had typed up a reply telling you not to give up so easily; to go maskless and enjoy your life; if you stay home then they win, etc.  On the other hand, not supporting a business that enforces the NewNormal is just as legitimate way to protest.</p>
<p>I'm keeping a list of businesses that harass me about going maskless and I will not be giving them any more money, even if things do return to the old normal.</p>

        <p>It was never actually about the numbers or real statistics this is all theater to ruin trump’s campaign and attempt to save the radical left agenda he is currently destroying. The virus will disappear the minute he is re-elected and then the real fun starts as we sue and charge all these corrupt politicians with crimes against humanity for ruining people’s lives over a relative hoax and sending infected patients to nursing homes to increase the death toll and receive federal funds. They’re all still operating like they’re above the law which is hilarious because look who the president is... deep state isn’t there to save them anymore.</p>

        <p>There is no radical left agenda on the truly political questions, like economics. There isn't a dimes worth of difference between a moderate Republican and Moderate Democrat. That's why everything is always about Russia or some silly thing. Because they have to find some way to pretend to be different from each other on important issues. </p>
<p>But I do agree, Dems think this will help their loser neoliberal Biden win. I don't think he will.</p>

        <p>One, we need to sue them now.</p>
<p>Two, I agree with you that this is all political theater, but personally I don't think it's about ruining Trump. I think it's general run-of-the-mill totalitarianism brought on by people with controlling mindsets, whose moral outlook revolves around policing the behavior of other people. And therefore, this shit isn't going to end after the election, assuming we even <em>get</em> an election. We very well may not.</p>

        <p>It's definitely about hurting Trump too. Why else do you think they keep trying to blame him for everything? He's done nothing but help since this virus became news. I'm not gonna get in a fight with you over this but I urge you to really think critically about whether or not the Democrats seem to be purposely trying to come after Trump time and time again. If you think they're going to drop the virus if they win the election you are sorely mistaken. The Democrats will double down and make the virus seem like an even bigger threat to push more totalitarian laws. Our future as a civilization globally depends on Trump winning the next election. If Biden wins the devil takes over earth via a one world government. I really wish I was wrong but after 10 years of investigating all these "conspiracy" theories I have no doubt that's what's happening.</p>

<p>That's exactly the point that I'm making. I'm saying that it has little to do with Trump other than his obvious mental retardation and his complete mishandling of the crisis, including his unwillingness to stick it to governors subjugating their citizens with this crap. </p>
<p>A lot of these people who support this crap are doing it specifically <em>because</em> they want to destroy society. A lot are communist or anarchist who want to dismantle society and put their own socioeconomic models in place. A lot are SJWs or moderate Democrats tagging along for the ride. They want to take control of it and impose their own will on the American people whether they like it or not, and the virus gave them the perfect opportunity to do so. </p>
<p>They're doing this not to get rid of Trump, but to impose a nanny state on the American people. They are the kind of authoritarians who say, "I know what's good for you", and it shows.</p>

        <p>For fuck's sake, he had a perfect opportunity to rally his conservative base and guarantee winning re-election simply if he had doubled down against the lockdowns and used executive orders to force states to reopen, but he didn't. Instead he, too, allowed himself to be cowed by their crap. And instead of putting an end to all of this he fucks off and plays golf.</p>

        <p>This is exactly how I feel too. They have made life and society so dystopian that I won't be going anywhere or traveling until things go back to old normal. What is the point of going to the mall or to a restaurant if people are wearing masks, standing and sitting behind plexiglass, "social distancing" (dystopian term) and businesses are spraying a bunch of chemicals every hour to disinfect (way to create antibiotic resistant bacteria that will become a huge problem in the future). This is our life now? People participating in and accepting this "new normal" (most dystopian term ever) shit . What is the point if trying to do normal life activities you once enjoyed looks like an Orwellian nightmare? No thanks, I'll just wait till society starts acting sane again, which they will have to by the end of the year if they want to avoid total economic collapse.</p>

<p>I never thought about that, but you're right. It's evolution at work. They're helping natural selection along, removing the weak from the ecosystem and ensuring that only the strongest, which can withstand our disinfectants, survive.</p>
<p>I was already rolling my eyes about places' "sanitizing" everything, and that gives me good reason to roll them even harder.</p>

        <p>I'm with you on this. It is tricky and nuanced issue though. We need to support our small businesses and communities. They're the hardest hit. But at the same time, I don't want to support the ongoing lunacy. But if they don't follow the guidelines, they risk having licenses revoked, being shut down, losing their livelihoods, etc. So I understand it on that level.</p>
<p>When Costco announced they would be requiring masks to enter, and I saw a gigantic line spanning the entire outside of the building because of social distancing, I never went back. When my 2nd option after Costco started looking a little too much like that, I stopped going there too. Thankfully there were still some options to shop without ridiculous measures (<em>some</em> measures are there, but most people behaving normally regardless and no one seems to be freaking out there). </p>
<p>If it comes down to it, I will make the hard choices including but not limited to changing jobs and moving locations. We need to be able and willing to do the right thing, even if it's the hard thing.

        <p>I just resigned from my job today, because I'm not willing to go back and wear a mask all day, every day. Thankfully, I was able to find other work online that I can do. I know not everyone is in that position. I'm making less money and things will be tight, but it's worth it to me.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what they want. Do you think those in control actually care that much about a fucking mask? They want us isolated, dehumanized, and slaves to big tech. They want small businesses ro shut down and us to stay home. Dont let them win. Also, many businesses dont really have a choice.</p>

        <p>It's a certain level of feeling micromanaged. I don't want to go somewhere that makes me feel like I'm being constantly watched. Places that try to enforce social distancing and masks beyond signage, i.e. confronting patrons over it, can absolutely go fuck themselves, because that's a step too far.</p>

        <p>Yep. I’ve got about 5 places I know that haven’t said anything to me about masking. Im spending more time outdoors. Having friends over or going to their places. Ordering stuff online. Most people I talk to hate masks but they want to be respectful. In our area there’s a small but vocal group of women who are actively making phone calls and sending emails to try to force everyone to mask. 100% of them are part of the unemployed volunteer class in their 50s-60s. One of them ripped off her mask after getting winded going up two flights of stairs, so there’s that.</p>

        <p>pretty much, yeah. im only down for protests and public parks. in public parks, lots of people go maskless and everyone there disobeys social distancing. no one's there to enforce those policies. there are signs reminding people to distance and wear masks, but they are ignored. at protests, lots of people wear masks but no one practices social distancing. social distancing is way more bothersome to me than masks are. </p>
<p>when gyms open up, there will likely be too many restrictions. so ill choose to workout outside. i have a bike, suburban cycling is fun, and i also enjoy walking around nyc. i can also purchase exercise equipment from amazon (agility ladders, exercise bands, etc...) to widen my options for non gym workouts. i miss the gym, but i need to avoid the restrictions in place. </p>
<p>i dont intend on going to the movies, retail stores, malls or amusement parks. and i think ill also avoid other places where social distancing and masks are enforced</p>

<p>I said a long time ago that social distancing and masks should be an either/or proposition. If you want me to social distance, then you have no right to ask me to wear a mask. If you want masks, then the hell with social distance.</p>

        <p>I haven't been anywhere that a mask is required. </p>
<p>I go to the grocery store that doesn't require masks, to a local coffee shop, or to the park, where no one is ever wearing a mask. </p>
<p>It bothers me that I do so little, but I'm so uninspired. I just can't participate in the weirdness, so Im just hiding from it. I'll say 90% of my interactions with others are online. Im trying to keep my morale up and at least stay curious about life instead of just numbing out and dumbing down.</p>

        <p>Masks are harder for me than social distancing. I have a lot of anxiety around "doing things correctly" and this is a new layer of standards. I'm at home now second guessing if I was wearing a mask in the ice cream place today. </p>
<p>Social distancing I don't really follow. I do what I normally do, get as far from strangers as possible and act normally around friends and family who see it the same way I do.</p>

        <p>Yah, I'm not a fan of that level of conditioning, too many dodgy experiments in the 20th century shows what happens. Pavlov, Stanford, Milgram the more well known ones. I don't want to be a rat following instructions implanted by behavioural psychologists.</p>
<p>My psyche, my spirit, just won't tolerate it. I try to make nature my anywhere when I can. Doesn't make sense anyway when paranoia and anxiety is at times encouraged now for services that only existed as distraction and fun before.</p>
<p>As soon as some places offer the competition of ending restrictions I'll go there to help show what the market wants. </p>

What we embolden, we grow.</p>

        <p>If I have the choice between multiple businesses, some which enforce masks and others that don’t, then I will choose the ones that do not enforce it. Case in point: AMC theaters. I was sad when they were close to going under. But then they caved to the Twitter pressure of mandatory masks. Unfortunately, this means I will not patronize their business. Cinemark and Megaplex do not require masks; thus, I will go there instead. </p>
<p>However, if I do not have any other alternatives, I will wear the mask as required — but I will bend the rules whenever possible. My area of Utah has a good amount of water parks but only one amusement park. The amusement park requires and enforces masks in queues, only as of the past few weeks. Well, I have a life to live, and I’m not letting the paranoid people stop me from living that life. My trips to the park will be much shorter now, and I will probably spend more time at the water parks instead; however, I still will go to the amusement park and I plan on bending the rules when I can. We’ll see how it goes. But I will still do what I want, when I want, with whoever I want. The part that is missing is “and however I want to do it”.  </p>
<p>I’ve ordered a “No New Normal” sticker from Etsy, and will be sticking it on my laptop right next to my science and tech stickers. That way when I’m in college classes and have to wear the stupid mask, at least people will know I’m pissed about it.</p>
