    <strong>If you still think the vaccine works, check out Chile</strong>
    <p><p>Most Western countries have no problems right now because it's summer, when the virus disappears. The UK has about as many people in the hospital for COVID19 as it did one year ago on this day. It's a mistake to look at the current numbers and conclude that the decline we've seen has been due to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Chile is in the Southern Hemisphere, they fully vaccinated most of the adult population and yet there's no decline in deaths visible there.</p>
<p>It's clear from looking at Chile that the vaccine doesn't work, although the media will tell you that it's the Chinese vaccine that doesn't work. However, nobody has ever come up with a satisfying explanation that would explain why the Chinese vaccine somehow makes no meaningful difference in deaths, whereas the Western vaccines work fine and more importantly, will still be working fine this winter.</p>
<p>It takes a handful of single point mutations in the receptor binding domain and you're dealing with a virus that is now immune to the antibodies your body produces against it.</p>
<p>Worse, there's a real risk that we're going to be dealing with antibody dependent enhancement in people who were vaccinated, meaning that we'll merely end up with more deaths this winter.</p>
<p>It's now just a matter of waiting a few months and then you will see that we'll be dealing with an explosion of new variant strains with mutations that escape vaccine induced immunity. Here's a study done on the subject:</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250780">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250780</a></p>
<p>&rt;Our structure-function analysis revealed that epitopes for RBD-targeting nAbs overlap one another substantially and can be evaded by escape mutants with ACE2 affinities comparable to the wild type, that are observed in sequence surveillance data and infect cells in vitro. This suggests that the fitness cost of nAb-evading mutations is low. We then used evolutionary modeling to predict the frequency of immune escape before and after the widespread presence of nAbs due to vaccines, passive immunization or natural immunity. Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to vaccines or other prophylactics that rely on one or two antibodies for protection can develop quickly -and repeatedly- under positive selection. Predicted resistance timelines are comparable to those of the decay kinetics of nAbs raised against vaccinal or natural antigens, raising a second potential mechanism for loss of immunity in the population. <em>Strategies for viral elimination should therefore be diversified across molecular targets and therapeutic modalities.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Take a good look at that last sentence. It's arguing that merely vaccinating people against the receptor binding domain is not a sustainable solution, because it mutates so easily to escape antibodies. In other words, when we take the emergence of new variants into consideration then the evidence would suggest that the Western vaccines are merely going to be even more ineffective than the Chinese inactivated virus vaccines are proving to be so far.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The only real solution we have right now is prophylactic treatment.</p></p>

        <p>It's made up propaganda. Pretty much anything is labelled Covid and if people die or get sick then it'll be blamed on Covid. Courts have already ruled it was a fictional narrative.</p>
<p>https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/frontlinenews/lisbon-court-rules-only-0-9-of-verified-cases-died-of-covid-numbering-152-not-17000-claimed/</p>
<p>The likely scenario for this winter is that anyone dying from the vaccines is considered a Covid death and all flu, cold, or other illness are recorded as a Covid case. They'll use the false data to blame the unvaccinated and push harder for mRNA injections or booster shots.</p>

        <p>Yup. Thatâ€™s exactly what I think is going to happen this fall/winter. And you bet your ass, they will come for the unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say "the vaccine doesn't work". I'd say "the vaccine doesn't promote health and wellness". I think the "vaccine" is doing what it's designed to do.</p>

        <p>I've known for a while now that the vaccines don't work. Look at Seychelles, The Maldives and Cambodia, three highly vaccinated countries. Not only have these vaccines not decrease the number of cases and deaths there, but they have only increased since vaccination have started in them. In fact, Cambodia didn't have a single recorded Covid death, until vaccines were introduced there. Now, it has hundreds of Covid deaths.</p>
<p>If the vaccines actually worked, this all wouldn't be happening.</p>
