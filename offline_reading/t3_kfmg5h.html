    <strong>can I just freaking RANT for a second</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Australia. I graduated uni in April (well, I went to uni for 5 years to not even have a ceremony) and I applied for a J1 visa to do a Disney internship in Orlando back in March which I was so eager to do and it all got cancelled. Disney rules states you need to have graduated within the last year, and they won’t be back for god knows how long so that whole 4 month chunk of my life that I had plans for went to shit. So instead I was unemployed for months because it was meant to be my pathway to a more ‘adult’ job after graduating. </p>
<p>I just applied for a camp counselor position at a camp that I thought was absolutely perfect and I got super excited and thought well it’s not Disney but it’s close enough, and I hadn’t heard back so I emailed asking if I can assist in any way and they told me that they aren’t hiring international people right now because of what’s happening. </p>
<p>I am so fucking DONE with plans being up in the air and in Australia we literally get 20 cases and we’re talking about lockdowns again and I just can’t fathom how anyone can make any plans ever again if we are gonna do this open close bullshit?!?!?! I’m in my early to mid 20’s and I can’t fully accept how much of my precious life and these perfect years to travel and explore are being utterly wasted while I sit and stare at the wall wondering what could’ve been. Life is short and it all just seems like an absolute fucking scam to be spending it like this</p>
<p>I get that for most people this sounds petty, people are dying from this virus. But guess what, people are also dying from the lockdowns. I can see how people who are already suicidal or depressed may be pushed to the edge. And then there’s the fact that everyone’s issues are valid even though they are different for everyone. Maybe someone has a minor inconvenience this year and I still think they should be allowed to be pissed like I am. I will never ever ever fucking forgive the world governments for this torture. </p>
<p>And while I’m at it, I hope that in the next few weeks to months we see a lot more people converting to our side, the side of rational critical thinking and anti-propaganda. I hope you all are doing something every day to push for this shit to end. I for one am looking at starting media channels to have a platform to talk about this stuff, TikTok videos are so easy to go viral, anything to get people to just step back and THINK. Don’t underestimate conversations with people in your life. I have converted many people into rationality this way. </p>
<p>I’ll leave you with an Orwell quote “We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it”. Guys, we all know this shit ends when we say it does. Stop complying. Stop allowing others to comply. It will never end if we don’t make it.</p></p>

<p>I'm going to place an extra poster next to some "Benches not in use due to COVID-19" signs. Words to the effect of: "if we can sit down at work, we can sit down here."</p>
<p>It's not an attack on the pandemic's reality or the need to tackle it, just the horrific arbitrariness of the way our human leaders have decided to do so.</p>

        <p>I feel your pain man. I’m young and had many plans, and now it’s all gone to shit. There is so much evidence that there’s some bullshit going on, but no one will budge. They’ll just keep believing everything the media and government tells them.</p>

        <p>I came here to see the wildlife, like one goes to a zoo. But this may be better then the zoo, because while I feel bad about the caged animals, I don't feel bad about watching little cunts have a sook.</p>
