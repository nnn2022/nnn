        <p>Who is being imprisoned? Asking someone to isolate for a couple of weeks so they don't spread a potentially harmful illness doesn't come close to "imprisonment." When I needed to travel to Mass and back to Maine, nobody stopped me. Nobody questioned my out-of-state plates. When I needed to return to Maine, it was the same. I took five tests for that process, but that was entirely my own choice.</p>
<p>Why are you so wound up about this? Nobody's freedom of movement has been forcibly restricted. Are you upset that you're being asked to wear a mask when entering stores?</p>
<p>If a person is ill, their treatment is primarily between them and their doctor. If what you're saying is that, should you become infected, you're demanding the right to infect others, then you're just being an asshole.</p>
<p>Are we being lied to? Sure. Every time a testing methodology is simplified. Every time someone describes the disease process of covid-19 (as we don't understand it very well.) Are we being <em>lied</em> to? Certainly people are reaching a lot of incorrect conclusions, that's for sure.</p>
<p>If you see a conspiracy, then... fine. Knock yourself out. Please don't argue that covid-19 doesn't exist, or is a purposeful attack of some sort. Do politicians and corporations take every advantage they can from world events? Yup. No surprise, there. Are you saying that the spread of the disease is being boosted by wealthy billionaire puppeteers? That's a pretty gigantic claim. You're going to need more than speculation to substantiate that.</p>

If you don't want the government to have the power to imprison healthy people in their homes with no due process, you do not give them that power.
I'm mad that it started with wearing masks in stores, but now that means that schoolchildren are forced to wear masks all day in spite of no evidence that it would be a beneficial practice and abundant evidence that it can be harmful. That's child abuse buddy, and it's grotesque that the practice is encouraged, particularly by a public health apparatus.

If you don't see a conspiracy, fine... but keep your mandates, emergency powers, and debasement of liberty to yourself.</p>
