    <strong>Has anybody been getting marketing calls for the covid vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been called about 3 or 4 times by a phone number I didn’t know, they never left a message the first one or two times they called. I figured it was standard post-lockdown/covid spam/robocalls. I saw the number a few weeks ago, and finally answered; it was a woman that mentioned the covid vaccine. I didn’t even let her finish her sentence and just said “Yeah, I’m not getting that,” and hung up, then forgot about it. Just saw the same phone number calling me right now, and told them that I wasn’t interested in the vaccine, to remove my phone number. The guy tried to keep talking to me after saying he would remove it, so I just hung up. Is anyone getting similar phone calls?</p></p>

        <p>Holy shit that is freaky. It truly baffles me how many people would take that call and be like "wow I guess the government is really concerned about my health these days!!!"</p>

        <p>Yeah, if I wanted the vaccine, I would go get it. According to my coworker, who was practically tripping over himself to get it as soon as possible even though he is young, the location he went to didn’t ask for any information, they just gave him the vaccine without question. Not sure why they would need to call people to get it if they’re just giving it to anyone who shows up.</p>
