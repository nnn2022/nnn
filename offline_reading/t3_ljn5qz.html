        <p>Me and my bf went to his parents' house for dinner on Friday, after not seeing them since mid-December (due to lockdown). As I said on my post earlier today, Israel is going through a lot right now with the vaccines and delegitimisation of peoples' right to avoid the vaccine.</p>
<p>So we were in the middle of dinner and suddenly his parents started talking about the vaccines and asking why we haven't gotten it yet. I explained my position on the matter and then they just began spouting everything that the media is saying and said that people who don't get vaccinated should stay at home because they're putting everyone else at risk.</p>
<p>WTF. Why did you even get the stupid vaccine if you still have to be afraid of other people? I'm not endangering anyone! I barely even go out, I see maybe 3 people a week - at most! How am I a danger to society? How did we even get to this, that parents are turning against their children instead of understanding us and protecting our autonomy over our bodies?</p>
<p>Me and my bf are both young and we're planning to have kids soon, so why the hell would we risk our health with an experimental vaccine when we aren't in a risk group? We're both healthy, he never even gets a cold! What sense does it make to hastily put unknown things inside our bodies? I don't believe our government at all, I don't trust them and I know that if anything will go wrong with the vaccine - we won't have anyone to turn to. And besides, how can people even support a system that functions this way with divisive rhetoric and essentially bullying people into vaccinating? Isn't it a huge red flag?</p>
<p>I feel so betrayed by his parents. It's not enough that everything is going on around us, but experiencing this pressure from people close to us? I don't even want to see them anymore, to be honest. I have enough trouble to manage my anxiety, I don't need any more of it.</p>

        <p>How do you respond when you’re minding your business and get yelled at for not wearing a mask outdoors? </p>
<p>I was yelled at and chuckled and shrugged it off.  I saw the guy who yelled at me days later and I confront h about yelling at grown men in the public street.  This guy was hyper emotional and reactive - a lost caused so I walked away.   </p>
<p>I pride myself on being still and no reactive, but I just had an urge to stand up for what is right.  I feel a breached my stoic inner self.  Should I feel conflicted about reacting and standing up for myself?</p>

        <p>You should definitely stand up for yourself. I am torn because I am a small woman. I have not been yelled at for not wearing a mask outside (yet). But if it happens, I am torn between standing up for myself or just ignoring them all together because I'm so small and can't fight..lol.</p>

        <p>I got in a couple verbal altercations last week and it's an uncomfortable feeling that lingers for sure.  I've also been pretty even-keeled my whole life.  But I feel like I would be more bothered if I didn't say something.  Now I didn't raise my voice or get emotional or weird or anything, just spoke my mind.  I think it's important that we recognize extraordinary circumstances can require an out-of-character response.</p>

        <p>&rt; How do you respond when you’re minding your business and get yelled at for not wearing a mask outdoors?</p>
<p>Probably by putting one on. I'm assuming you're leaving out context and weren't in the middle of an open field but walking on a street or similar where local guidance was to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Hey all you who come here to yell at us. I just want you to know you're doing an excellent job of affirming our beliefs in the lies the media is peddling and how anyone who <em>doesn't</em> ask any questions is a brainless sheep being calmly lead to the slaughterhouse and thanking the butcher the whole way there. Please keep up the good work of insulting people in the hopes of changing their minds. If you're that terrified of us and people like us, feel free to stay in your homes for the rest of your lives while we move on with our lives.</p>
<p>I'm going to disable comment notifications and ignore all your responses telling me what a shit human being I am and how I'm killing grandma. If you desperately need to, if you cannot live one more hour without insulting me, you DM can me.</p>

        <p>Just got word that a cousin passed away this morning. He'd tested positive weeks ago when he went into the hospital. The medical team acknowledged that they caught his case pretty early, and they were familiar with studies on hydroxychloroquine, but they didn't give it to him. When we asked why it couldn't be an option, they didn't give us an answer. Doctors knew he was fading, but they didn't allow any family, including his wife or his mother, to be with him in his last moments. They didn't let his children come at any point to say goodbye. My family is hurt, it all feels like a strange dream, and it seems that a sense of closure was taken from us.</p>
<p>Call me crazy (I've been called worse), I'm not angry with nor do I blame anyone for what's happened. I still think these lockdowns are harmful, that we're being lied to about many things when it comes to this virus, that we should/do have a right to choose for ourselves how to continue our lives. I'm not angry at the world for trying to keep on living. What <em>does</em> make me angry is that the leaders of the world have been sitting back watching our suffering, and are content to make us suffer more. And enough is enough.</p>
<p>This rant went on longer than it should, but I just wanted to say this: Stand up for what you think is right. Don't give up on what you believe. Take the time to hug your loved ones and tell them you love them. Our time in this world is so short, so make the most of it that you can, because no matter how small, this life is <em>yours</em>. No one can tell you how to live it.</p>

I am still blown away that my elderly grandmother had a doctor smart enough to prescribe her HCQ last year...she was better within just a few days. This could have been your cousin's destiny too💔

        <p>I don't blame the "deniers". I don't blame "doomers" either. It's not anyone's fault that he got sick. It just happened. But that doesn't mean I can't be angry at the fact that no one could hold his hand as he died, that there's potential treatment being withheld from people because the "heroes" are playing politics, or that everyone - you, me, all of us - have been hurt in this past year and we never get a chance to heal because our leaders want us locked up even more.</p>
<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with being upset over those things, but feel free to disagree.</p>

        <p>People get sick all the time and it's nobodies fault. So why is it different now? The flu kills a significant amount of people every year and we don't hold each other accountable in the same way. It just happens. It's also natural selection to some extent too like you pro maskers keep pushing. Granted modern medicine is amazing and I'd be dead without it there's somethings that just happen and you won't change it no matter what you do. Like cancers and flu and other illnesses. Things like weight can be controlled. Diabetes if developed from being overweight can be prevented and controlled. But it's up to the individual. And if you try losing weight but don't then see a doctor. Help yourself. People have to help themselves.</p>
<p>I'm over weight too and I'm aware of it and I'm working to be healthier and lighter. It's my responsibility no one else's. </p>
<p>People get sick and die. That is life. Depends on how well your body is designed to deal with illness. You look out in nature and nature is brutal. That's just how life is. Yet we become more and more death adverse when it's a natural part of life and people die all the time and there's nothing you can do to stop it.</p>

        <p>Actually, I don't think you're sorry. I think you're sitting on a moral high horse, jumping into this sub full of "denial" to lecture about how wrong we are. And you didn’t read what I said very well - I didn't deny that covid existed, I said we were being lied to about it.</p>
<p>And yes, we asked about hydroxychloroquine because we thought doctors would consider all options. If covid is such a death sentence, what is the harm in seeing if it could maybe ease a patient's suffering?</p>
<p>But I'm the one in a denial group, so what do I know, right?</p>

        <p>How much do you know about Hydroxychloroquine? </p>
<p>You would have to be insanely naive to believe what the experts are telling you when what they say contradicts themselves within the span of weeks or months.</p>
<p>This whole thing has been politicised to an insane degree. Do a little bit of research on these topics before spouting nonsense.</p>
<p>Honestly these people should be charged with crimes against humanity. They are responsible for tens of thousands of people dying unnecessarily.</p>

        <p>See https://hcqmeta.com/ for an overview of proper randomized controlled trials. Results:</p>
<p>&rt;HCQ is effective for COVID-19. The probability that an ineffective treatment generated results as positive as the 205 studies to date is estimated to be 1 in 28 quadrillion (p = 0.000000000000000036).</p>
<p>&rt;Early treatment is most successful, with 100% of studies reporting a positive effect and an estimated reduction of 66% in the effect measured (death, hospitalization, etc.) using a random effects meta-analysis, RR 0.34 [0.27-0.44]. </p>

        <p>It's shit. 2/3rd of my friends have lost their jobs because of covid. They're all suffering really badly mentally atm. I've another friend whose the opposite. She never wants things to go back to how they were yet she's stuck at home with her abusive mum. And talks about how she just wants to move away from people and live in a cabin. And I'm like, you think you'll be able to do that if lockdown continues? Yet she wants more of it and her mental health is taking a nosedive I think its just how she's coping but it doesn't seem healthy. </p>
<p>My friends with jobs don't want to let the friends who've lost their jobs complain about the fact they've lost their jobs. It's just not healthy at all because no one feels they can talk about what's happening and it's making it worse.</p>

        <p>I was unemployed when this "pandemic" began and I'm still unemployed now, mainly because I hardly feel a reason to live let alone go out and do anything. It would be different if we knew for certain when the lockdowns were going to end but the constant goalpost-shifting has me feeling really hopeless. God-willing the Democrats have their fill of ruining our lives for their own gain by spring so that things can open back up but knowing them they'll milk this for all it's worth.</p>
<p>Part of my problem also is that my closest friend when this all started now wants me out of her life because I'm a covid skeptic. I'm focusing on making new friends who actually have the critical thinking skills to question the government in case something like this happens again but I know I'm going to have trust issues for a long time regardless.</p>

        <p>Mask compliance is starting to dip again in my area. For awhile it was like 95%, near 100% and I ultimately caved to wearing them about everywhere since I didn't want to be the outlier, but now that it's down to 75-80%, that it's enough people not wearing them to give me the confidence to do so. Curious if other people feel the same way? If could get to where about 1 in 4 aren't wearing mask all over then this charade will finally drop.</p>

        <p>indoor compliance is still near 100% where I live but fortunately I'm able to get away with not wearing one at least in larger stores. my doomer roomate insists that she's seen a ton of people doing the same but I never have, not once, so maybe she's just paranoid idk. she's certainly the type to believe that if everyone wore them things would be fine</p>

The article said something like "people here are more scared of getting Ebola than covid-19".  Why does that need to be said?  One kills 50-60% of those it infects and the other kills 0.3% of those it infects.</p>

        <p>A covidian in my family (wearing 2 masks, in our home with no one else in the house) just informed me that everyone in the house now has to wear two masks, because the new strain of COVID is twice as deadly. I laughed out loud, but he was being 100% serious. </p>
<p>I told him that all of this is nonsense and laughably non-scientific, and he insisted he had done the research and double-masking is “proven to work by countless studies”. I asked him to show me these studies and he refused. He pleaded with me to wear two masks when I go out. I told him I’ll wear one mask. He said to me, “chudslayer, I’m scared and it would make me feel more safe if you wore two masks.”</p>
<p>It was a sad and disturbing statement to hear. The devastating power of this campaign of psychological terrorism by our media and government to reduce us into cowering, mindless, conformists is plain to see. </p>
<p>He joked, “why would they lie about masks? To make profits for the mask industry?” I told him it was about social control, about training us to obey and to engage in doublethink. He dismissed that suggestion as ridiculous.</p>

        <p>He actually used to be pretty in tune with alternative media. He was the one who got me into it. But all I hear from him now is the TV narrative. I don't know what happened.</p>
<p>I once asked him, "Why do you trust the MSM now after all the lies? They always lie! You know this." He said he still doesn't trust the MSM, because he thinks the pandemic is actually <em>worse</em> than they are telling us. I was speechless. I thought to myself, "This is psychosis."</p>

I only ask because my own dad has degenerated mentally over the years lol something happens with people as they get older they lose any ability to think critically and think for themselves.

        <p>Brother, actually. Although he likes to act like he's my dad.</p>
<p>My best guess is he has just succumbed to fear. And I think he's more comfortable living in fear of COVID-19 than accepting that we live in a world where everything we think we know is a lie, where nearly every government in the world would coordinate together to orchestrate such an amazingly massive and malicious deception (Which I can kind of understand; it is unprecedented, and I wouldn't have predicted they were capable of this), but the evidence indicating that that is exactly what is happening is overwhelming at this point for anyone willing to look at it. </p>
<p>If the government and the media wanted the numbers down, if they were trying to do damage control, they would talk about vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. They aren't doing that because they want the numbers as high as possible, because the more afraid we are, the more they can control us. But he won't listen to this. Crazy, cuz he's also a 9/11 truther. I'd have thought he'd see through this. But then again, the 9/11 war on terror wasn't a war on <em>us</em>, while the "pandemic" is. So it didn't hit as close to home.</p>

        <p>Tbh my personal conspiracy theory is I still think most governments are leveraging this pandemic to wipe out elderly populations. With boomers expected to put massive strain on an already strained system as they get older and require more care, they need to make room for that. Hence why LTC homes are suspiciously more affected. Going off that same theory, I wouldn't be surprised to have another pandemic in 20-ish years of a virus that conveniently kills old people the most.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I think it's about eugenics. The real agenda seems to be be about addressing "overpopulation", based on what Bill Gates and Co are saying at their WEF meetings. My suspicion is that the campaign to vaccinate the world is a covert mass sterilization program. Perhaps it won't sterilize us personally, but will sterilize our future children by altering our DNA. This way the effects won't be noticed right away and it won't be easy to prove a link to the injections. I think the billionaires view this as the "solution" to climate change.</p>

        <p>I read earlier today that over in Hawaii, their lieutenant governor is considering on mandatory vaccines and or COVID testing for domestic travel and for even gatherings and events such as weddings and events. This really set my ire off because if Hawaii imposes this, there is bound to be a domino effect where all the states could impose this. I told off their lieutenant Governor on a Hawaiian news website comment section because of this saying "FUCK you for proposing this forced compliance!" I am at wits end with all of this COVID BS and all this forced compliance continuously being shoved down are throats as has been for nearly a year!</p>

        <p>My biggest concern is now long term restrictions on travel. Masks are a problem too. but having to take a bogus PCR test to go to where I want or do what I want is a whole other thing. WHY hasn't there been any class action suits on the unconstitutionality of forcing US citizens to prove they don't have a virus that disproportionally effects the elderly and that over 99% of people are barely effected by?</p>
<p>I don't see people being too eager to get vaccinated but I don't see many people calling out the testing regime nearly as much as they should. And I don't see this going away anytime soon. I'm sure it will be about some other virus in a few years. There will always be some new strain that requires having to get a test. If they make you get one to travel domestically, that's the end IMO. It will become a permanent invasion, just like the TSA's gropings. Fake negative results will only get you so far if it becomes normalized and electronic. I don't see an easy way out of this unless there is aggressive legal action and we form our own airlines.</p>

        <p>I'm in Michigan. After the state supreme court told Whitmer she couldn't declare indefinite emergency rules she just started ruling through the state health departments. Whatever wacky bullshit she comes up with is enforced by store and restaurant owners or else the health department will shut them down. Currently restaurants can open at 20% seating and use outdoor seating. A tent full of people is considered outdoor seating because that makes sense.</p>

        <p>I cant with this world, I want to fly home but my toddler wont wears mask and theyll try and force him too, I also dont want him too, if lungs gotta be fucked up let them be mine not his. Everything is wrong and people just wont see it.
Also can can "health professionals" just sit by and let us get so fucked over this? Theres so much out there that shows what works and how not deadly it is, but still let the farce go on?   I like having a job as much as the next but I'm not willing to sell my soul for it.
Why are people so damn keen on sacrificing the young for the old? Why has all of a sudden it become our job to look after others health? I dont get it, my brain hurts, I dont want to exist anymore, just kind of living and hoping for something better, I'm so depressed watching people just throw away my boys future, I'm just sigh, enough. 
And forced vaccinations why is it suddenly becoming a thing? What is in them that they are trying so hard to get everyone to take them? If this goes through goodbye bodily autonomy

        <p>Valentines sucked, i’m really finding it hard to be excited or happy about anything these days since my main coping methods all involved getting out of the house, seeing people and generally doing things that stopped me overthinking. My partner is brilliant in a lot of ways but not one to think of cute little surprises or anything so Vday was like any other weekend where I find it impossible to get out of a negative headspace. This was the same for my birthday last month - no gift or special plans for either, they were just like any other day in this hellish lockdown. (UK)</p>
<p>That paired with seeing other people online enjoying themselves, making the most of it, and my housemate taking over the living room for a makeshift picnic with her partner and watching films on my tv just pushed me over the edge. Sometimes I get these sorta emotional breakdowns maybe once or twice a year (already had 3 this year go figure lol) that often end in me self harming but sometimes recently result in me throwing/breaking objects which I did last night and threw what I believed to be an empty coffee cup which was actually full of some kinda chocolate pudding which went all over my kitchen and newly cleaned clothes. I cleaned it then ran upstairs to self harm but managed to use breathing techniques and talk myself out of it but as a result went to bed at 7pm and have just been lying here until now it’s 4am and I just can’t stop overthinking about how bad everything is and how little there is to look forward to. I feel like I waste every weekend unable to relax. And there is no solution because every coping method I have is gone and every day is so boring it leaves me with nothing to do but overthink.</p>
<p>I think if I didn’t have a job to go to (thank god) idk if I would still be here, I see no end to this</p>

<p>thank you so much for the offer, I may take you up on it, would be good to have someone to talk to who shares the same views as the few friends I have left seem to think I am stupid for being this worried about covid restrictions :( for now i’m gonna try to get some sleep, but thanks so much kind stranger</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry to hear you're having a rough time. It's quite understandable. This is not how human beings are supposed to live. Humanity is about sharing laughter, togetherness, food, dancing, joy and celebration with each other. This has been frowned upon for too long now and in many cases taken away. You're feelings are completely valid. I don't know about you, however I've found when I go to those dark places in my mind, that meditation really helps me. I download this free app on my phone called Insight Timer. Even just 2-5 minutes a day makes a huge difference to my mental health.  I also find keeping up my spiritual health is key. everything I consume mentally has an impact on my thinking. I don't know what you've tried in the past, however, life can and will be bright again. How you're feeling is temporary. Trying some deep 4 count breathing just to start and make sure you're taking are of your basic needs. Eat clean food and drink clean water if you're able. Much love and light to you.</p>

        <p>thank you so much for the advice, I will definitely give the app a go, have used headspace in the past but found it a little cringey in parts but willing to give it a go again on another app. You’re right about mental consumption, my best coping method in past has always been something to take my mind off it/distract but there is obviously very little we can actually do right now. Being able to take my mind off it mentally with meditation would be an amazing skill to learn </p>

        <p>You're doing a wonderful job. Sometimes just making the next right choice is all we can do. I've found acknowledging the emotion I'm feeling " anger", sadness, whatever it is, and just recognizing it and telling it, "hi", yes, it's you again, and reminding myself that it's temporary and can pass, is really powerful for me. It's important with emotions to remember that we are NOT the emotion. I'm not angry, or sad, or mad. I am feeling this feeling.  I am feeling helpless. Hopeless, etc. when we do that we take back the power of our humanity and not let the emotion or feeling drive us. It's so hard when the world feels really dark. It really is a habit of mind and that's why I use that free meditation app to help me train my mind and develop habit. I'm still learning and have a long ways to go. You can do hard things. You are brave.</p>

        <p>When anybody claims to have any absolute principles they live by, they are lying.</p>
<p>Humans have an ideal world they are striving toward, and "principles" are usually a way of concealing what they really want, by pretending to live by some completely impersonal, abstract value system. eg "Every human life is valuable" - but then, they turn around and wish for somebody's death, gloat over the deaths of their enemies, etc.</p>
<p>First figure out what someone's ideal world looks like (because they might not openly tell you, might not even admit it to themselves) - then you can easily predict their reaction to any individual event or hypothetical scenario.</p>
<p>That's where most "gotcha" stuff in politics comes from - you can EASILY skewer anybody based on the principles they pretend to have, because it won't always align with the ideal world they (generally secretly) want. And in politics that's usually about 90% "I want my enemies to suffer horribly and die", plus a smattering of less important ideals (eg "free healthcare for all").</p>

        <p>I need support you guys please. no one is listening to me. I'm drinking and eating so much out of sheer stress I'm putting on a lot of weight even though I exercise a lot on in my free time. I'm fully on the boat of the pandemic being an exercise in control and authoritarianism(I'm in Scotland). what's worse is the ruling party here have set this up as a political point scoring exercise on the way towards gaining independence from the uk. if Boris says give it 2 weeks our supreme leader says give it 4. for no reason other than to look better than Westminster. I'm fucking sick of it and I don't know anyone else who agrees. even my partner has said stfu to me</p>

        <p>What can I do about always wanting to eat now?  Not only does life suck now but I have to put up with food cravings like a pregnant woman but I’m older and don’t have the metabolism for that. </p>
<p>Any advice?</p>
<p>I’m sure this is happening because I have no life anymore and my brain is craving dopamine.</p>
<p>When I’m not at work all there is to do now is be home alone either doing housework or scrolling through apps or watching Netflix and I don’t like doing any of that, I wanna have my friends back and go to each other’s house to chill and goof off and I wanna be making travel plans. But no . . I’m in my little pod trying to not do or own anything and still be happy.</p>

        <p>Are gyms open where you are? If you have a consistent workout routine it will be easier to help regulate your appetite. Also try a food journal but write down everything you will eat the night before then use it as a checklist. I guess everyone is different so the methods I use may not work for you but hopefully it will be some help</p>

        <p>Where are the mods on this sub? Almost every post I read has a handful of thoroughly downvoted comments from people who believe this is the new normal (you know who they are). I’m just curious since I know many other subs remove comments/posts that go against what that sub stands for. I know those people are trying to get their point across but they can do it elsewhere.

        <p>unironically calling people sheep; the sure sign of an intelligent user-base, and definitely NOT a fringe conspiracy sub!!  </p>
<p>also funny calling people sheep while simultaneously crying that you have to see their dissenting opinions (which often contain handy facts and sources).</p>

        <p>I don’t mean sheep in a derogatory sense, actually. I just think it’s a decent comparison for a group of people that follow each other based off of what another person does or says. </p>
<p>Not crying about dissenting opinions at all, I actually am always open and interested in hearing the opinions of others, but am genuinely curious why people who do support this “new normal” choose to spend time on a page that is literally called “no new normal.”</p>

        <p>Posted in the other daily thread but an hour later it was taken off the top of the subreddit replaced with this new one. </p>
<p>Well guys, I got covid around 7(9 days now) days ago and have been fine other than loss of smell or taste of a few foods, but last night I had a really bad panic attack due to a case of shortness of breath,which has given me hella chest tightness the day after. My blood oxygen levels are completely fine so I know ill be fine and as I'm younger in age, but it's awful. </p>
<p>I still agree that there shouldn't be a new normal created out of this/masks forever and fuck China for releasing it, but I'm not gonna lie, im definitely on board with getting a vaccine each year to not feel this shit every 6 months/continuous scarring of lungs, just don't take away my fertility pls.</p>
<p>More BLUNT things I can add about the experience is:</p>
<p>-If you're a fat fuck, lose the fucking weight, and do it fast. I wouldn't call myself a fat fuck but i feel like alot of fat fucks would get grounded to shit by a bad case of rona. I find myself never wanting to be in a shit situation health wise ever again so I've genuinely not had any appetite for sugar/High carb foods, none.</p>
<p>-you do find yourself thinking about the people you may of been around after you unknowingly got the virus and think for a second "ah shit granny killer". But don't think that, please. There is most likely an asymptomatic person in that same exact store who had a likelihood of passing it to granny anyway.</p>
<p>-now/after I've gotten over the big C I will not be consuming any media, the negativity of it all factored into my basic house arrest in isolation is what most likely was a factor in the panic attack, no wonder everyone's mental health is going to shit. It can be a bad virus but Holy shit we KNOW it can be but it also can be passed through much more than just the mask so stop pushing for masks for god knows how long, it's literally just science theater. My girlfriend is a carer and the only way she could have gotten covid is through her fucking EARS with how well protected the equipment is that they recieve, and apparently that can happen.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns have taken practically everything away from me. I can't take it anymore.</p>
<p>My PhD research is stuck at a very early point, because I cannot leave the country to access the necessary sources. I have not played piano publicly in eleven months. Having my pieces played by an orchestra is now a pipe dream, there are no concerts of contemporary music whatsoever. My weight is increasing and my body is becoming frail, more and more every week. The brain fog is blurring my memories, my skills and the ability to communicate. There is no hope that this is ever going to change, and I have never been so close to ending it all.</p>
<p>I can't describe how I miss having something to look forward to.</p>

        <p>I moved back in with my family because the lack of socializing was getting me to how you feel and I couldn't take it any longer. </p>
<p>I've tremendously cut down alcohol and have started taking a lot of vitamins to counteract the binging I've been doing and I'm starting to feel great again. The alcohol was killing me. Even just socializing with my parents I feel a million times better too.</p>
<p>Ive accepted i will never marry or have kids at this point. I bought a home gym bench and adjustable weights and a hex bar for partial squats, and a mountain bike. I'm looking to start a new line of work. Things are looking up.</p>

        <p>I feel like I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown again. I hate this new world and the new normal. I hate everything about this world. Not just the lockdowns. People have changed. The normies I mean. Everyone is apologizing for stuff they don’t need to apologize. I’m afraid of this world, my whole existence rejects everything about it. I feel like I am surrounded by delusional psychotic people, a mass psychosis and I’m the only one holding on to the normal. People are tiptoeing about misgendering at work even though there are no trans. I don’t know. I am really close to breaking down again. I feel like I am losing my mind. I’d rather be born into a horrible life in poverty in 1700s than this. At least I could trust that the material reality is real. Now I feel like I’m the last person on earth who still knows what even the scientific method means. That there’s gravity. That the earth is a globe. A planet. That the sky is blue. 
I wish I had a community in real life like this sub. I feel like I’m totally losing it. I hate everything about this world. I can’t find a single good thing living in these times anymore</p>

        <p>I’m getting married in July, and I’m starting to get so nervous about my wedding. My fiancé and I both have large families, so there’s not many people we can cut out if we have to. I want all of our family and friends to be there to celebrate with us. Also, I know this seem minor, but I am so sad about the idea of wearing a mask on my wedding day. I want to be able to see my fiancé’s face when we say “I do!” And I want to be able to see my family’s faces. I was feeling better about it when we initially were planning back in August/September. The summer wasn’t that bad. But now that people are getting the vaccine and we’re STILL being told we’ll have to wear masks and keep quarantining even after that, I’m losing hope. I just want all of this to end. </p>
<p>No one is forced to come to our wedding. If anyone doesn’t want to because they don’t feel comfortable, that’s fine! But it’s infuriating and upsetting that we have to take all of these precautions even though the people we’ll be with are the people we see all the time anyway, and they are willingly taking the risk of coming out to our wedding. I’m trying not to focus on it too much, but it’s hard.</p>

        <p>You all are very concerned with your freedoms being taken away. I have to ask, have you given much thought to facial recognition’s impact on freedom? Facebook had technology that was as accurate as a human at identifying faces. It used to be a crime to wear a mask in public in many places. Now you are free to exist in public without a record of your every movement being sent to the servers in Utah. Covid likely set CCP scale facial recognition surveillance back 10 years.</p>
<p>If mass surveillance doesn’t bother you, but closing some non essential businesses is tyranny, can you stop bleating about your freedoms? You don’t care about freedom, you just like consuming goods and services. </p>
<p>What freedom was taken? There’s more gun owners than ever. More protests than any time in the last 50 years. The Internet has unleashed a torrent of speech, for better or worse. Unemployment paid enough to pull millions out of poverty in the spring and to be free from their bosses. </p>
<p>What is freedom to you? Because freedom to me is being able to do what I want without coercion. Freedom isn’t paying people to provide goods and services. If it was, we’d be able to purchase Kalashnikovs, blowjobs, and shamanic psychedelic journeys.</p>

        <p>I see people wearing winter coats and hats. What a bunch of fucking sheep! LOL! I did my own research and found out that only 1500 people die from hypothermia in the US per year. That's only 0.0005% of the population. They live in fear of something that 99.9995% of people wont die from. It gets better, a lot of the people who died from hypothermia were wearing coats and hats, and they still died! Coats dont work!</p>

<p>Is it a hoax? Is it biological warfare? Is it China vs the world? Is China working with the democrats? Are all countries working together?

        <p>Again, not the virus itself, but the concept that it was chaotically created. You have to place a causal actor behind it for you to be able to rationalize its existence at all. </p>
<p>Truth is, nature doesn’t care about us, and sometimes millions of people die for no reason other than a virus. No conspiracy, no mass control, no shadow plot. Just sickness and death. Accept it, do your part to prevent it, and shut the fuck up</p>

        <p>Again, it’s clear you don’t fear the virus. This is much more fundamental than that. </p>
<p>Maybe not you, but the vast majority of people attributing this virus to an outside actor (other than nature) subconsciously (and probably consciously to a degree) fear the chaotic and unknown. </p>
<p>For something this terrible happen, or, to be perceived to happen, it must be rationalized as implemented by an authority. This causes the entire perspective to be built on a false assumption and it’s a confirmation bias cascade from there.</p>

        <p>You don't get it. There is very little to fear in the first place. It's a lame virus that prolly jumped from a filthy animal to humans on the other end of the world. The terrible part is the bullshit fear mongering that's been going on for almost a year. The actual threat is miniscule. If you're terrified, it's because you don't understand math.</p>

        <p>None of the above basically.  People have speculated on the origin in terms of being from the <a href="http://english.whiov.cas.cn/About_Us2016/History2016/">Wuhan virology lab</a> but that really isn't the important point of discussion.  The main point to take away is that all of the measures being done to combat corona are not justified by the impact of the disease itself.  Even more important than the present and last year, the changes that are happening will not easily be rolled back once the "pandemic is over".  Even more troubling than that is the fact that there isn't any clear criteria for it to end.  Most people I asked about how long they plan to wear masks etc. said that it would just be until we have a vaccine but now we have the vaccine and people are saying that we still have to wear masks for an indefinite time going forward.  The <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">Great Barrington Declaration</a> is a good reference for what this sub is all about.</p>
<p>Basically it's a big overreaction.  If the virus was actually as deadly as what is portrayed in the move Contagion, maybe some of this would be justified.</p>

<p>You can still transmit the virus even if you had the vaccine. And you will probably only have to wear masks until herd immunity is achieved.</p>
<p>&rt; If the virus was actually as deadly as what is portrayed in the move Contagion, maybe some of this would be justified.</p>
<p>Not sure why you folks keep parroting this. The virus is deadlier than the flu but the main reason lockdowns exist is to prevent a massive flux of people who might require hospital care while they recover from the disease. There aren't enough beds, oxygen or personnel to attend all if too many people require aid at the same time.</p>

        <p>&rt; You can still transmit the virus even if you had the vaccine
The last research I saw said they haven't been able to disprove the possibility of vaccinated transmission but I wasn't aware of any change in that research, do you have a link?  Or are you just assuming the worst due to lack of conclusive evidence?</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember the simpler times when it was only just 2 weeks to avoid hospitals from being overrun.  Some how it never happens though.</p>
<p>I actually remember a specific chart from the local dweeb, Mark Ghaly trying to scare people out of being able to spend Christmas with loved ones.  The chart literally projected the hospitals to be overrun on Christmas day itself at the current transmission rates.  And sure enough, there was a big spike after that press conference but some how the doomsday event never came, even after at least another month supposedly huge spikes.</p>
<p>The doomsday predictions never come true even after Trump totally botched it as everyone says.  I understand the need to plan for the worst case scenario but it does not seem worth while to continue to take measures that have real and immediate consequences.
I don't know what to tell you if you think all of the damage being done to society and individuals is worth the lives its saving.  I do realize there are people out there who's lives improved because of corona because they get to work from home and save money etc which is part of what is making people not wanting it to end.</p>
<p>Perhaps the worst thing that they have done has been the campaign to demonize the anyone who doesn't tow the line and causing an society to turn our neighbors, friend and family into dangerous enemies that want to kill you.  Scapegoating is always morally reprehensible but it's even crazier that people are fine with turning against their fellow man when the actual enemy isn't even living and it's sole purpose is to do exactly what it does, infect.</p>

<p>The 1889 Russian Flu was probably caused by a novel coronavirus, OC43. And 130 years later, it's still circulating all over the world. If you're waiting on herd immunity for this virus, you could be waiting forever. If that's cool with you, go for it. But I've dumped the masks, declined the vaccine, and I'm moving on with a normal life. You are free to live in endless terror of covid19 if that's what floats your boat.</p>

If it is a hoax, they dont have to be scared anymore so they use confirmation bias to convince themselves and anyone who will listen (not crazy if you're not the only one right?) that it's all a conspiracy.

        <p>So your stance is "vulnerable people have always died when exposed to illness and viruses, what's a few more dead vulnerable people?"</p>
<p>Believe or not, the media is a tool to help spread information. Reddit is media, youtube is media, newspapers, TV shows, physical letters, twitter.... its ALL media. Using your logic, it's the media (just in a different form) that has convinced you "it's just a cold". No shit the media told us it's our duty, we wouldn't know people were dying as a result of our actions otherwise. Not everything you read in the news is a conspiracy dear.</p>

        <p>No, my stance is "you didn't give a damn about vulnerable people until you were told you had to".</p>
<p>&rt;has convinced you "it's just a cold".</p>
<p>Actually, it was just a cold. I get one every winter.</p>
<p>&rt;we wouldn't know people were dying as a result of our actions otherwise.</p>
<p>How long have you been alive that you didn't know people die? I learned that when my age was still in the single digits, <em>dear</em>.</p>
<p>Humans are not immortal, and never will be. People die. People in my family have died. Hell, another of my relatives may die this year (great-grandma is 100).</p>
<p>You can kill someone just by making them five minutes late and causing to them to have an accident they could've avoided if not for that extra five minutes. This is not revolutionary.</p>
<p>And I said vulnerable people were protecting themselves long before 2020. They didn't need the media to tell them to do that.</p>

<p>Yes... yes they were protecting themselves.. with vaccines. Vulnerable people shield, take medicine and are vaccinated. That is how they protect themselves and the reason they do/did this was because information was spread via the media that advised them on how to stay safe. How else would they know a flu vaccine (closest thing we can compare to covid) even existed without being informed via the media?</p>
<p>Before media? Hundreds of years ago before we could pass information so easily? They died... lots and lots of people died and lived a poor quality of life. The plague, the spanish flu, measles, rubella, polio, tuberculosis, smallpox etc etc all killed people in masses. They dont anymore because we protect people with vaccines... if there isnt a vaccine or treatment, it is a threat to vulnerable people and if you had a shred of a conscience, you would do your bit to help them until they can go back to protecting themselves.</p>
<p>Dont worry, your life will be back to normal in the next year or two and you can continue not giving a fuck about other people. In the meantime there are a lot of people without the means to protect themselves because there wasn't/isnt a vaccine or medicine to protect them...</p>

<p>Let's see if you have that same attitude when somebody close to you gets ill and you rely on other people giving a shit about them to help them.</p>
<p>What a horribly depressing outlook you have to have such a lack of consideration for other people. We are all human and we all need eachother. We need, doctors, nurses, surgeons, veterinarians, garbage collectors, supermarket workers, builders. Without people giving a shit about eachother, we wouldn't be where we are today as a species. Working together is literally the key to our success. 
The doctor that gave enough of a shit to deliver you as a baby and make sure you were breathing okay. Why didnt they just let your mom give birth at home and risk infection/complications? Why are you alive and educated enough to read today? Because total strangers gave a fuck about you.</p>
<p>You're a victim of this detached modern world where every fucker is just out for themselves. The world and human race progresses, in spite of people like you. Thank fuck you are the minority because the society would crumble in a single generation if we all had your attitude. It's nothing to do with internet points and everything to do with having a clear conscience knowing you did your part to help another person through life.</p>

<p>Wow. You are late. I said above people in my family have died. Lost my grandmother to cancer, lost my great aunt last year, and I said I'll likely lose my great-grandmother this year. I myself have been in three nearly life-ending incidents.</p>
<p>Keep trying.</p>

<p>&rt;we wouldn't be where we are today as a species</p>
<p>We as a species have ruined the world and consistently wiped out the habitats of other species. This is not a good thing.</p>
<p>&rt;Why didnt they just let your mom give birth at home and risk infection/complications?</p>
<p>Because they signed up to be a doctor. <em>That's their job</em>.</p>
<p>&rt;Why are you alive and educated enough to read today? Because total strangers gave a fuck about you.</p>
<p>Those "total strangers" were paid. And my mom taught me to read, not preschool.</p>
<p>I have a $930 bill for an ambulance ride where I never received any care whatsoever, in the ambulance or at the hospital. Keep pretending everyone is altruistic. I guess it helps you sleep.</p>

        <p>You honestly think care workers get into that field because of the money? Do you have any idea how badly paid a careworker is in comparison to the work the undertake? How naive can you be? No... they do it because they care. The paycheck just allows them to do the job they love whilst being able to afford necessities like food and rent. Nurses like helping people, builders like building homes, vets like helping animals etc.... as for your ambulance bill... that's America for you... remember, the world isn't just America. A large amount of countries have free health care that is paid for by everyone in the country. America leads the way in dog eat dog capitalism so I suppose I cant blame you for thinking that way. </p>

        <p>There's people here with actual scientific backgrounds who've done scientific research before who are still concerned about the vaccine. Just like there are genuine doctors who also oppose the methods being used. Science should never been one sided. If it is, you're doing it wrong. Stephen hawking proved one theory then did everything he could to disprove it and that is how science works. Yet we are not seeing that because governments and pharmaceutical companies are muddying the waters so we don't get the whole picture. Which is what I personally have issue with. And there are many people who do too here.</p>

        <p>The only one here denying science is the single digit IQ simpleton unable to comprehend that this virus has a 99+% survival rate, and that’s with verifiably inflated numbers. And the sruvival rates are even dramatically higher for those under the age of 75 and those without 2 or more of the following comorbidities: asthma, diabetes, ovesity, hypertension, autoimmune disorder. These people, also, are the most suceptible population to any disease and the flu could prove fatal to them. Sad, but not a result of Covid-19. Wake up buddy. You’re being spoon fed lies.</p>

        <p>Well, I never claimed to have evidence of what % of science deniers have died from the pandemic or not. I'm sure there's no real research or statistic for that, so I never made that claim. The guy above did.</p>

        <p>Hey you should probably wear THREE masks! Fauci said it only stands to reason that more mask means more protection. Also, stay away from cats and dogs they might be carriers! Don't eat ICE CREAM (Covid-19 was found in ice cream shipped from China) Make sure to take your vaccines!! Both of them because one won't do it you need a booster, but it doesn't matter if they're not the same... Oh wait nevermind they changed it again! Don't mix and match vaccines!! Oh wait turns out again it could be fine you just might bleed from your ears. It's ok though for you because you don't seem to use your ears anyways...</p>
