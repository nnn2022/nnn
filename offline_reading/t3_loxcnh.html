    <strong>Education severely disrupted, so glad I found this sub</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously, I feel like I've been living in some alternate dimension the past few months. No one questions anything! Everywhere bans discussion that is critical of the current media narrative when it comes to covid.</p>
<p>Here is my experience: When covid was first discovered, I was rightfully scared like everyone else. The videos of people dropping in Wuhan were really worrisome. At that time, lockdowns and restrictions seemed feasible, because we didn't know what we were dealing with. Now we have a wealth of information, and most people are ignoring it.</p>
<p>I believe covid can be serious. One of my family members died in one of the nursing home outbreaks, so I have seen firsthand that when it comes extremely vunerable elderly people, they need extra protection like the vaccine. However, governments are starting to mandate the vaccines for young people in some countries, young people who statistically are only affected by covid at a miniscule rate.</p>
<p>How can no one see this is medical authoritarianism? Every major forum and website censors any concern about mandatory vaccination or potential side effects. Major news outlets lump everyone who doesn't want the covid vaccination in with radical anti-vaxxers who either don't want any vaccines or believe Bill Gates is microchipping them, when this isn't reality. I can't believe that fellow left leaning people blatantly accept this narrative when it is using coercion to force people to have a medical procedure and give them no choice. </p>
<p>I have several illnesses and I don't think it's wise for me to get the vaccine when there is no longterm study data, specifically in regards to the issue of autoimmunity. Which brings me to another point... People keep talking about the long term side effects of covid, but postviral illness has been around much longer than covid and no one cares about it. </p>
<p>ME/CFS is a horrible illness where you experience dehabilitating fatigue, neurological problems, exercise wipes you out, really horrible things. Often it is caused by EPV, mono, and things like that. You have to suffer these symptoms for 6+ months to qualify as having CFS, for example, I've had it for multiple years.</p>
<p>Yet the media says that any symptom, no matter how mild, lasting 2 weeks after you've come down with covid, is going into long covid territory. Seriously? If you have ME doctors make fun of you, ignore you, force you to take psychiatric medications (since there's no diagnostic tests currently they like to act like it's all in your head) yet we are putting billions of dollars into long covid research and taking it super seriously. They pretend as if this thousands of people aren't suffering daily from ME, it's all about covid. Maybe if they put this vigor into studying other diseases we would have far less sick people and comorbidities that actually do put people at higher risk for covid complications. </p>
<p>That's just one example of the clown world shit I've noticed. Another thing I've noticed is the education world has gone batshit too. I'm studying at university and I cannot count how many ways I, alongside other students, have been ripped off, wheeled, and dealed by institutions of higher education and our governments. </p>
<p>For example, travel bans and covid restrictions prevented me from showing up at my university halls of residence for several weeks. This caused me to miss all of the events where you meet other students, faculty, and tour your uni. I barely have any friends because I'm so damn isolated, I have not had a single in person class/lecture all year. I have autism and communication is difficult for me, my uni gives pretty much 0 support and chalks it up to covid rules. I still haven't been refunded rent for the weeks where the government physically would not allow me to be at university.</p>
<p>My school has also hired covid marshals to try and police people from sitting together or taking off masks outdoors. It's a bloody joke. If you say anything about how this is creeping into dangerous territory, some privledged virtue signaller activist students will say you literally wanna kill grannies and we are in the midst of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>The majority of my uni's students got infected with covid and no one got seriously ill, but this meant pretty much everyone was in quarantine before more lockdown were reinstated. My degree is very hands on, and we only had 1 practical work session all year, which I couldn't attend due to the aforementioned covid restrictions. The other session was cancelled due to covid quarantines I'm pretty sure.</p>
<p>I am being charged several thousand extra for practical/laboratory fees. These labs are not happening. My university refuses to refund me and my complaints have gone unheard. Whenever I went to seek help with this complaint, I was told online learning can be adapted to suit the needs of the degree, and I would have to prove that it wasn't good enough. Students are being scammed and getiing sub par education, and no one is helping us, they say we all have to make sacrifices because of the virus.</p>
<p>You can see some students going into food banks, terrified looks on their faces, because they can't ask for help from their uni. Even if their families lost jobs due to covid, if they don't have the money to pay their tuitionright on time, the unis threaten to deport them and revoke their visas. News outlets have reported this, yet there is radio silence.</p>
<p>How can people not see how fucked up this is?</p></p>

        <p>You've hit the nail on the head. I sometimes wonder if I've slipped into some living nightmare. None of this is normal and everyone in charge appears to have lost their collective minds. The fact you cannot even discuss how mad this is without being called a conspiracy theorist shows the year long propaganda has worked. None of this is normal and the level of government overreach in our daily lives is something the Soviet Union would be jealous of.</p>

        <p>It really is crazy. My partner accuses me of being a conspiracy theorist simply for stating that most people I've come across have recovered from covid, and that I personally do not want to take a vaccine yet with no lonngerm trials when I have several illnesses already that put me at risk for autoimmune fuckery.</p>
<p>Because I have disabilities, when I go outside sometimes I have to sit down and rest as walking can be painful. My partner has jumped down my throat saying we can't sit down because two people (who live together) can't be outside loitering during covid lockdown. Every time we go grocery shopping he meticulously checks the cases and acts like we are going into some kind of war zone.</p>
<p>I am very careful about washing hands, keeping my face covered, and giving people their room, but the way people look at you in public as if you have ebola or something makes 0 sense to me. I understand they are scared, but this is something else.</p>

        <p>Yes, I have a lot more empathy now for those whose lives were destroyed by the draft.  My dad was drafted into the Navy and was a bombadier in the Vietnam War, and while I have always known it was a big part of his life story I never fully appreciated what that meant for his psychological wellbeing until this past year. He was just living his bachelor life in NYC and all of a sudden, through absolutely no choice of his own, he's bombing innocent people halfway across the world. Of course COVID lockdowns are not the same as war, but having your entire life and society uprooted from idiots in charge is traumatizing.</p>

        <p>&rt; COVID lockdowns are not the same as war</p>
<p>That's merely a minor distinction in semantics. Make no mistake, war is still being waged against us, except the differences now are the types of <a href="http://www.stopthecrime.net/docs/SILENT%20WEAPONS%20for%20QUIET%20WARS.pdf">weaponry</a> being used, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctvt0ansKkw&amp;feature=youtu.be">people</a> wielding them and the <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/483271-france-severely-limits-movements-elections/">enemy</a> at which they are aimed.</p>
<p>War has always been a rich man's game. In the past, they had to con young men into believing that their brothers from Over-there-istan were monsters who wanted to destroy them. We're still being conned, only this time we've been made to believe that an invisible enemy that lives <em>within us</em> needs to be destroyed.</p>

        <p>I agree with you the bill Gates stuff is mega cringe. I specifically said that is being used as a distraction from people's actual concerns, cause of how ridiculous it is.</p>
<p>When all the elderly/vunerable people are vaccinated, it shouldn't matter if asymptomatic young people are carriers or not, as the individual's immunity will provide protection.</p>
<p>The asymptomatic spread debate is still going though, it seems like there is not much of a consensus as to whether or not it is a big factor at play in the infectiousness of covid. A lot of our predictions are made using models, which don't really accurately reflect the real world data. </p>
<p>"Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease physician at the University of Alberta who has been reviewing the available literature on the topic, said studying asymptomatic transmission is extremely difficult.  Van Kerkhove was referencing modelling data that estimated anywhere between six per cent and 41 per cent of the population may be infected but not have symptoms.</p>
<p>Saxinger said that modelling data is "flawed" because it makes assumptions about how many people are asymptomatic and then runs a simulation on how many people could then transmit it."</p>

        <p>My story is very similar to yours - I'm even also autistic. Last spring was the final semester of my master's program - I didn't get to defend my thesis in person (instead it was over Zoom, yay 🙄) and the overnight shift to online learning was an absolute joke. Thankfully I only had one class left, but it was ultimately useless and I learned nothing. </p>
<p>I also lost an elderly relative in May of last year, and I was completely on board with protecting the vulnerable. But this has gotten completely out of hand and I think I'm close to believing it was all orchestrated from the beginning. If this past year has taught me anything it's an understanding of how people become radicalized.</p>
