<p>- Katie Clack was a 23 year old nurse</p>
<p>- She did not want the swine flu vaccine (Pandemrix) but was required to have it for her job</p>
<p>- A coroner concluded that it is "most likely" she developed narcolepsy as a result of receiving the swine flu vaccine</p>
<p>- Her narcolepsy led to depression and suicide</p>
<p>- A class action lawsuit was launched on behalf of 38 Britons, including 19 children, who developed narcolepsy after having the vaccine</p>
<p>- Scientists from the former Heath Protection Agency (HPA) said there was evidence of a link between the Pandemrix vaccine, which was manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and narcolepsy in children</p></p>

        <p>Good question. </p>
<p>It seems the UK government had to pay compensations to victims because they had indemnified GSK.</p>

<p>This article mentions a civil case against GSK but I don't know what the outcome was:</p>

        <p>This is a lecture given by the "virologist" (Marc van Ranst) in charge in belgium aswell as the "virologist" (Ab Osterhaus) whose on stage there aswell who is the "expert" in the netherlands, about how they pulled this same scheme with the mexican flu using fear and manipulation and how they did it.
Both are animal doctors that took a course in virology and became vaccine marketeers.</p>
<p>There is a clip easily found of ab osterhaus celebrating the first child infected with mexican flu and him recieving an order for vaccines from the government (for that same vaccine) celebrating it with a bottle of whiskey.
But that's a different clip and in dutch so most of you wouldn't understand what's being said there and the dutch people on this sub have probably allready seen it.</p>
<p>Anyway here is the lecture, please watch it, it is appaling.</p>

        <p>Wow. What he says about the football team cheating to get the vaccine and him making a big deal out of it to make the vaccine seem desirable really resonates. </p>
<p>I remember many articles and news stories about how some people were cutting the line for the Covid vaccine - either the young pretending to be older or the rich using their money/influence. This really drives the message that the vaccine is desirable.</p>
<p>Similarly, I read a comment the other day on reddit about how people in other countries really want the vaccine and some people here (presumably they meant the US) don't. But the thing is that in any population, you will have people who want it and people who don't. </p>
<p>Yet we don't see many news stories about the Indians who don't want the vaccine. And if it does get mentioned, they make sure to mention misinformation and superstition, and it's just "that one village".</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing the video, it's super interesting.</p>

        <p>Agreed, I find their attitude very condescending.</p>
<p>I also noticed how quickly he skipped over his conflict of interests statement at the beginning.</p>
<p>"Lectures and/or advisory boards for GSK, Sanofi-Pasteur, Merck, J&amp;J, Abbott, Biocartis"</p>
<p>GSK, the manufacturers of Pandemrix...</p>
<p>I'm also find quite manipulative the idea of going to a funeral just in order to score marketing points.</p>
