    <p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRZRqSjfPgKTFv68fjvh-FIbWjS95xAZha6QXgTUyKNTpe97_hCzMtZOe0eirzBH1PkGbHV60gse3Js/pub">Here is a flier I made yesterday. The same day my workplace reinstated mask mandates.</a></p>
<p>I'm planning on buying a printer and just printing as many of these as I can, and start spreading them around my city. At Targets and Walmarts and Churches and Neighborhoods and Courthouses. I will do this until the tide of the narrative starts returning in our favor. I will do it with whatever free time I can. I will be respectful, and not do anything that makes people uncomfortable, nor attempt to break any laws. The goal of these fliers is to 1.) get the public on our side. We can do that if we are 1.) Consistentand 2.) widespread, 3.) Simple.</p>
<p>I realize people love to nitpick - I realize this message doesn't perfectly incapsulate all of our frustrations. But still, I think the writing is effective because 1.) It doesn't make the narrator sound like a conspiracy theorist 2.) it is straight to the point. Too many movements like the WhiteRose have people tune out because they have too many different types of stickers with too many words.</p>
<p>I will do this alone in my city if I have to. But IDEALLY, if we all spread it - If we all just spam it and make the news that these fliers are showing up all around the country, with the *exact same message*, we will provide people a consistent, effective narrative that will be the kryptonite of the CDC and MSM, which is gaslighting and manipulating our way into a Tech Dystopia.</p>
<p>Our strength will not come from just the fact that we are right - it will come from the fact that our message is simple, and consistent.</p>
<p>"Demand normal now, or we will never get it back."</p></p>

        <p>Not a nitpick but by stating Delta variant is from India, you are confirming the entire variant narrative to be true which many think is a fabrication to push more jabs &amp; to vilify the unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>The “new” variant quite possibly came from the jabs and the jabbed. Merely a new variation of persuasion to get more people jabbed. “Normal” is gone and was never really normal anyways.</p>

        <p>Be careful and don’t make the mistake of thinking - assuming you live in the US - that you’re assured first amendment protection. The government has become increasingly “mask off” (no pun intended) about treating political dissenters as hostile enemies. I don’t think they would do anything that would get you convicted, but you could definitely be harassed by the authorities and potentially held overnight.</p>
