    <strong>Polio vaccine actually killed more people than organic polio</strong>
    <p><p>This was the precedent for the current "science." Inventor Dr. Ochsner was so gung ho about his beliefs, he killed his own grandchild with the vaccine attempting to prove its merits. Then he gave it to Americans and killed or infected 100s of 1000s with polio.</p>
<p>But for some reason, US history lauds him... why?</p>

What Oschner did was considered a tragedy at the time not because the vaccine was flawed but because the vaccine was tainted. It was considered a massive scandal in the US at the time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_polio">And the polio vaccine was one of the most important medical discoveries of the 20th century. It was an endemic disease that paralyzed and killed around half a million people a year.</a> </p>
<p>and if affected children particularly hard... in many cases crippling them for life. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk">And the man who is credited for inventing the first truly effective vaccine was actually Jonas Salk</a> who refused to profit off his vaccine because he considered it too important to commercialize. </p>
<p>I come to NNN because the dangers of covid are overwhelmingly small.. like bad flu small for the vast majority of the population. Covid affects the already sick and dying and extremely (85+) elderly and the response by society is not at all a measured or appropriate response. </p>
<p>Polio by comparison is orders of magnitudes more dangerous to society and it affects children by crippling them. </p>
<p>And I don't want to be associated with people who think its A-OK to catch polio and want an end to all vaccines.</p>

        <p>Actually, his "link between smoking and cancer" was Judyth Vary Baker's discovery and what led her to work for the CIA, thinking she was creating a cure.</p>

        <p>Its always the links, they make link between a condition and cause. Paralysis still exist in India but they say they eradicated the polio virus, immunodeficiency is linked with HIV there were studies that found no evidence regarding it. Covid/breathlessness is linked to corona viruses too. Still so many ppl recovered normally after getting positive. The condition which ultimate ends to death is always much more complex than simply getting positive. In India many ppl died due to oxygen supply ran out and it was being sold in black market.</p>

        <p>After injecting his grandchildren to prove his <strong>Faith</strong>, maybe he lost faith in the vaccine, and pushed them onto the public, knowing they were dangerous, so they would have to suffer the same fate he did.

        <p>Ochsner also researched weaponizing cancer for the military and was flown down by them to Argentina to privately treat Juan Peron for a back injury. He sent Ochsner's wife an alligator purse as a thank you, it's in his memoirs.</p>
<p>Peron was a Nazi, btw. If anyone cares about that stuff anymore.</p>
