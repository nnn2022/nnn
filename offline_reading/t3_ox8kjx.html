        <p>This has nothing to do with any particular decision (although SCOTUS did strike covid restrictions on churches in other cases) - this is about how the judiciary fundamentally operates. </p>
<p>The judiciary is not a legislative body - they adjudicate only “cases and controversies.” This means that they can only give decisions when that decision actually resolves an existing dispute. </p>
<p>For example, if Texas passes a law (on anything), and Joe Blow is charged with breaking the law and challenges it, that’s an existing dispute. If the case is pending and Texas decides that Joe Blow is right, there’s a problem with the law, and repeals it and drops the charges, there is no dispute anymore - and whatever issue Joe Blow had asked the court to decide is now moot. The federal court cannot issue a decision on the case because it would have no impact (no action would be taken, no right established, etc); issuing a decision once the issue has become moot would be legislating, not adjudicating. </p>
<p>This is a very, very well established principle of law that has been applied many, many times on all sorts of cases since the founding of the US: no federal court has jurisdiction to issue a decision or even <em>hear</em> a case in the absence of an existing “case or controversy.”</p>
<p>That is all that happened here: a church asked SCOTUS to rule on an issue (covid restrictions on churches) even though there presently aren’t any covid restrictions on church. The decision would not settle a dispute - there is no present dispute. It would essentially be an advisory opinion or, worse, legislation from the bench. </p>
<p>If the restrictions are reinstated, the church will have a case and SCOTUS very likely hear it and decide for the church; until then, SCOTUS literally lacks jurisdiction - they have no constitutional power to hear this issue because there is no case or controversy.</p>

        <p>This is misleading. </p>
<p>The restrictions have already been lifted, so there IS no existing case or controversy which means the federal judiciary has no jurisdiction. </p>
<p>The church has basically asked:</p>
<p>&rt; hey SCOTUS, there’s no problem now but can you make a ruling preemptively just in case there’s a problem in the future? </p>
<p>The correct answer is always no. </p>
<p>It’d be totally different if there were restrictions in place (there’d be a case or controversy to adjudicate), but that is not the case. </p>
<p>This title is false.</p>

<p>It's absurd to think there can be no ruling on the powers of the government to enact such laws, or maintain them.</p>
<p>The title is spot on. After a year and a half of government-gone-wild under covid, there has yet to be a single case in front of the SCOTUS on the topic.</p>
<p>There is no limitation to the government's power as long as they cry "Pandemic", according to the law.</p>

<p>Ruling on that is literally the judiciary’s job - but the judiciary, and SCOTUS, can only do that in the context of a case or controversy. It cannot rule on <em>anything</em> outside of a present case or controversy. </p>
<p>&rt; After a year and a half of government-gone-wild under covid, there has yet to be a single case in front of the SCOTUS on the topic.</p>
<p>That is a different issue, and you are wrong - SCOTUS has ruled on covid restrictions on churches. </p>
<p>However, SCOTUS’s performance on this issue has been very poor, both in terms of hearing cases (very few) and their rulings (eg only partially striking the CA restrictions on churches). SCOTUS has been deeply disappointing this past year … but that in no way changes the fact that legally <strong>this</strong> decision was 100% correct - SCOTUS lacks jurisdiction because that particular issue is moot and there is no case or controversy. </p>
<p>&rt; There is no limitation to the government's power as long as they cry "Pandemic", according to the law.</p>
<p>And “the law” is completely fucking wrong then. However, this is a separate matter of procedural law - judicial jurisdiction - and this one decision is procedurally and constitutionally correct. </p>
<p>It can be true that</p>
<ul>
<li>covid restrictions on churches are unconstitutional,</li>
<li>SCOTUS has dropped the ball and failed to uphold the constitution when given opportunities, AND</li>
<li>this one particular rejection was correct.</li>
</ul>

        <p>I agree, I am not looking to get into a legalease persnickety discussion over procedures. I don't care about them. At all. I'm lashing out at the principle of "The Justice System" in America and a SCOTUS who has allowed a year and a half and counting of Governors and local officials stepping all over the constitution and individual human rights in the United States of America.</p>
<p>So - fuck their procedure. and Fuck them.</p>
<p>"The Supreme Court won't block Maine's Covid restrictions on churches <em>because of some stupid procedure</em>" might be the only adjustment to the title I can imagine that would make it <em>more</em> accurate than it already is...</p>
