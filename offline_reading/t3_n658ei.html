        <p>Or you could just be a specialist that won't have any big push from big pharma. I went to the dermatologist yesterday and he had all kinds of advertising in his office, but it was all for stuff to make your skin look better, not stuff from big pharma. I went for skin cancer check up, so its not all vanity in that specialty. But, then again people have serious concerns about the look of their skin so you could find cheaper alternatives for stuff like cystic acne so you don't have to push the expensive stuff. That could really change someone's life and make them feel so much better about themselves. Or an audiologist, they push questionably overpriced hearing aids. But, I'm sure there are also cheaper ones you could research and really be a life changer to some poorer people who have bad hearing. </p>
<p>Point being, there are tons of things in the medical field that don't push vaccines. You could change the specialty you were planning and make a huge difference in people's lives without being a shill for big pharma.</p>
