    <strong>MSM back to double standards again: minimizing all vax side-effects while over doing it with the the rare young person dying from unknown circumstances</strong>
    <p><p>There's a plethora of comments on social media about people complaining and being worried about side-effects after taking the vax.  The only thing the MSM is reporting on this subject is that the odds of dying from the vax is infinitely small.  Nothing about some of the more serious side-effects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I've notices articles l<a href="https://globalnews.ca/video/7818511/southern-alberta-community-grieving-teens-sudden-death">ike this being all over the</a> news, about the 1 in a million teenager who had the misfortune of passing away from unknown circumstances.  While no autopsy has been performed (yet) to confirm reason for her death, the article states her parents believe it was due to covid.</p>
<p>Do people no longer engage in critical thinking?</p></p>

        <p>I work at a high school. I’ve had about 20 kids who have had symptomatic covid. They are all fine. And those are the ones who actually had symptoms. I’ve known 10 teachers who have had symptomatic covid, they are also all fine. No long haul symptoms, no hospitalizations. Maybe I’m lucky, but I just feel so badly for the kids. About 1/3 actively don’t give a shit, another 1/3 play along but do what they want (sports, see friends, god forbid party) and the other 1/3 are so scared I feel so badly.</p>
