        <p>The Bottlerock festival in Napa is something my girlfriend and I have attended for the previous three years buying 3-day passes at around $500 each and now it looks like we are no longer welcome at this almost completely out-door open air event that is held at the Napa fairgrounds.  Expecting people to stick a Q-tip half way into their skulls to go to a concert is not an acceptable compromise since getting a medical test to for weekend recreation is an unreasonable expectation.</p>
<p>There have been massive outdoor gatherings in operation in California and elsewhere in the country and world that have been operating without any major outbreak incidents that I am aware of so I don't understand the logic behind this decision.</p>

        <p>Are you kidding?  I got it in May and was horrible!  The damn nurse made my nose bleed and laughed about it afterwards! One of the worst pains I've ever felt in my life.  I'm not exaggerating, at the time I was telling my fiance it could be used as a form of torture!</p>

        <p>To be fair though, my coworker told me there's another covid test is different from the mainstream one, where they just swab an inch or so on the inside - so maybe that's what the person I responded to is talking about.  Benefit of the doubt and all that.</p>

        <p>So all who enter sign a waiver of liability for injuries.  We do it all the time.  Ever gone horseback riding?  You don't get on the horse without signing that.  Insurance does not dictate the extent of our freedoms</p>

        <p>Sure, I get that. But it’s up to insurance companies to allow a liability waiver. They might just not play ball there at all. So I’m that sense, insurance would have a significant say over our freedoms. Any legal battle would take years to fight out.</p>

        <p>They aren’t. They are, if I remember correctly, about 70% less likely to spread COVID. Which means y’all got injected with an experimental drug- if you got the mRNA version, a drug that has been found to be unsafe in dozens of trials since the 90’s and never approved- and you still have a 30% of catching it and spreading it. <em>slow clap</em></p>
<p>Also the immune response from any of the vaccines is about 6-12 months shorter than natural immunity.  so get ready for your semiannual boosters. </p>
<p>Meanwhile those of us who have recovered from COVID have like 99.9% lower chance of catching or spreading it, and no experimental jab.</p>

        <p>If there was extensive testing, if they waited a year or more before release and distribution, transparency all across the board when it comes to side effects, no pushing people to get it if they don't want it, and no trying to pass the deaths from said "medicine" off as some kind of coincidence.  Since that's never gonna happen, I will never trust the vaccine and they'll have to inject it into my cold dead corpse.</p>

        <p>70% less likely is a huge reduction and would save thousands of lives each month if all of you stopped being such babies and just took the vaccine.</p>
<p>I'm fine with getting semiannual boosters if that's what it takes. Getting the vaccine was a painless and quick process, had no side effects from it.</p>
<p>I also love how you believe that the vaccine is untested so you can't possibly risk taking it while you're okay with getting a virus that nobody fully understands and we have no way of knowing what getting that virus will do to you long term. Many people continue to see horrible side effects from covid months after their infections. Various studies show major long term health effects. And you somehow think getting covid is the better alternative than getting a shot that a few hundred million people like myself have gotten now without any side effects or issues. </p>
<p>Also mRNA has been seen as effective for vaccines since the early 90s which if you did any research into this you would understand how that undermines your point, not helps it. The reason pharma companies thought it was a failure was that you can't make good money on vaccines, they much rather have a situation where you need to take a mRNA dose on a regular basis (that's way more profitable than a vaccine you only have to take at worse twice a year). So they were really bummed out when the delivery system caused major side effects when they tried to treat actual disease with it. When using it as a vaccine you don't need the toxic delivery system and studies going all the way back to the 90s have shown using mRNA for vaccines was not only safe but extremely effective. So we have a vaccine that's been studied since the 90s that you think is unsafe but covid which we didn't know anything about until less than 2 years ago you think is okay to put in your body for immunity.</p>

        <p>Never said it was approved. What I said is they did know since the 90s that mRNA makes great vaccines since you don't have to worry about the delivery system. But they also knew there wasn't much money in that so they ignored it even if studies showed it as being extremely effective for that.</p>
<p>You're very concerned about the unknowns of this vaccine that has been studied since the 90s and hundreds of millions of people have now gotten without any serious side effects (most had no side effects at all). How concerned are you about the unknowns of covid (a disease we just learned about less than 2 years ago that has killed millions of people, and caused major long term health issues for millions of others)?</p>

        <p>What government is forcing you to do anything with the vaccines? </p>
<p>You didn't answer my question on how you analyzed risk in the case of vaccines vs getting covid. With covid without vaccine you have a 2% chance to die and a close to 10% chance to end up in the hospital. I don't know the exact percentage of people that get serious health issues from covid but that chance is extremely significant (especially since we have no clue what having covid will do to you long term). Millions of people have died. </p>
<p>By the same token over a billion people have taken the vaccine world wide now (a vaccine based on mRNA which has been studied since the 90s). The vast majority had no side effects (I fall in that group). A tiny percentage (less than 0.01% had what would be considered a serious reaction). Some felt sick for a day. Nobody has died from the vaccine itself. Getting the vaccine makes it insanely rare that you'll die from covid and extremely rare you'll develop any serious conditions from covid. You'll also be 70% less likely to spread it if you do get it. </p>
<p>So how is no vaccine the smarter choice here?</p>
<p>Also on the topic of God let's say you don't get the vaccine and get covid then spread that to others and somebody that gets covid from you dies in a slow painful way. How do you think God will feel about that? God gave you a tool to help not spread this disease to others and you refused to take it because you're living your life in fear. If that leads to you killing someone what will you tell God on judgment day?</p>

        <p>Yup, and there is no evidence they will ever cause major issues.</p>
<p>However, you know what has killed millions of people so far and caused serious health issues for tens of millions of others in just over one year? Covid. Something a simple vaccine using technology that's been around for almost 3 decades will prevent. </p>
<p>So why are you so scared of this vaccine and how do you not see the irony of how illogical that fear is given the alternative?</p>

        <p>My objections aren't about the vaccine technology.  They are about compliance for societal goals.</p>
<p>Medicine must only be practiced with that patient in mind.  It violates the hypocritic oath to push compliance with any medical procedure, recommend vaccination is fine.  Mandates and penalties are not.
Movement controls sold as vaccine passports are not.</p>
<p>There's nothing illogical about defending core liberties in the face of the latest great emergency.</p>

        <p>You pretend this is some freedom fighting bullshit. When in reality you're just scared of what you don't understand. And that fear is making you turn into a giant whiny baby.</p>
<p>If I own a business I have the freedom to only want vaccinated people around me at my workplace. You don't get to pick and choose what freedoms you like. If a state or country doesn't want you flying into their airports without a vaccine they have the freedom to do that as well.</p>

        <p>If I say the sky is blue you can't just come back and say "thats like just your opinion man". No it's not an opinion. You forcing your paranoid lifestyle on me and others while putting us all at risk isn't freedom. You do have the freedom to put all of us at risk, including all the loved ones around you. Nobody is saying you don't have that freedom.</p>
<p>But we have the freedom to point out what a selfish coward you are and to shun you for it. Putting others over yourself used to be something everyone in this country celebrated. Now we have cowards like you that think selfishness is the virtue we should all live by and you want the rest of us to reward you for it.</p>
<p>You're even too scared to listen to anyone that doesn't live in fear like you do and point out how illogical you're being because you're too scared to think about what a baby you're being. If your logic that this is just a trial is true, if you truly believe that, you should be able to acknowledge anyone that participates in this trial is a hero. And when the vaccine is FDA approved according to your own logic this will be then the largest and most thorough trial in medical history. Yet you have no respect for people putting themselves at risk* taking the vaccine. </p>
<p>And even after this largest trial in medical history where over a billion people have already participated you still won't take it.  Which is just the most moronic thing ever since once approved this vaccine will have more testing than any other drug or medical procedure ever. </p>
<p>How do you respond to this? Not with logic or reason. But with a childish "I won't comply with you". You and everyone else like you here are spoiled entitled children that are fucking it all up for the rest of us. Congrats.</p>
<p>*<em>I'm pointing out your dumb logic by the way, the risk is virtually nonexistent and getting the vaccine is far less risky than risking covid</em></p>

        <p>I'll take the shot in fall 2023 at the earliest once all the ADE reaction risk is more apparent.  So referencing the billion people who have taken the immune therapies so far doesn't mean anything for medium term or long term safety now does it ?</p>
<p>But other than that you are completely incorrect about my assumptions.  I don't actually care about my well being all that much.  I care about a society with free will and the right to make ones own choices - even if the media says those choices are unapproved.</p>
<p>You consider the below paragraph a reasonable response to me not joining a medical trial for an immune therapy that doesn't have sterilizing immunity against covid ?</p>

<p>Its clear we care more about different things.  That doesn't make you a hero or a coward - just someone who listens to the establishment.  Follow them wherever they want to go if you want - I'm not going.</p>

        <p>Ok friend this will be the last reply.</p>
<p>&rt;If yo think the billions of people that took the shot are participating in a trial do you think those people are doing an honorable thing?</p>
<p>I don't think they are joining a medical trial - they have joined a medical trial.  If done for others protection then sure that's brave.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you think the people that took part in the actual early trials are heros?</p>
<p>Yes for all medicines.  Right to try experimental drugs is essential.</p>
<p>&rt;What other medication or medical procedure have you used these standards of yours on?</p>
<p>All of them.  I read the science literature and try and understand the risks prior to agreeing to any medication or course of treatment.</p>
<p>&rt;If you don't care about yourself will you vow to not seek medical care and eat up hospital space if you do catch covid and have a serious reaction?</p>
<p>If France gets its way this will happen in 2 months.  You agree that this is ethical ?</p>
<p>I live in Canada, we have single payer government run health care.  I'm happy to have the system skip over helping me once it returns my tax dollars so I can pay someone else for medical care.  Until that time I'll let the state pay, I am ultimately one of its citizen's.</p>
<p>&rt;Also how do you still not understand that you're not only putting yourself at risk?</p>
<p>The vaccines don't provide sterilizing immunity, only reduced spread risk from lower viral loads in vaccinated vs unvaccinated people.  Then there's the CDC data showing nasal swabs levels of covid in infected vaccinated and unvaccinated people for delta.  Some bad news friend (bottom paragraph): https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/covid-science-antibody-test-reliability-faulted-new-predictor-of-covid-19-severity/ar-AAMLnie</p>
<p>&rt;If you get infected you are going to spread the virus before you even know you have it.</p>
<p>If I get infected while social distancing under a partial lockdown and while it's legally required to wear masks where I live.....</p>
<p>&rt;With the vaccine not only are you lowering your chances of spreading it by huge margins you're helping society out by helping eliminate it altogether (making all those regulations about isolation you're so concerned about obsolete).</p>
<p>It lowers your chance of spreading it by around 50-90% depending on strain.  That's not foolproof and certainly isn't going to eliminate covid because there are 5 billion other humans who haven't gotten it.  You're lying to yourself if you think the current crop of vaccines will be enough to wipe out covid.</p>
<p>It will keep mutating to become more transmissible and less deadly - and likely go away on its own like every coronavirus.</p>

        <p>Are you doing any thinking in making that choice or did you simply flip a coin and decided it landed on "vaccine bad"? </p>
<p>Because what I posted isn't just supporting arguments as if this is a high school debate team. This is something that affects not only your life but the life of everyone around you, including the people you love. By refusing to get vaccinated you're not only putting yourself at risk but you've decided you're okay with gambling with their lives. Don't you see how selfish that is?</p>
<p>As you must know we don't fully understand covid and have no way to know how it will affect those people years later that might have only gotten minor symptoms or no symptoms at all. We do however understand how the immune system generally works and that these vaccines are safe. So the risk analysis is simple in this case, yet so many people like you are refusing to put any logic or thinking into it.</p>

<p>Well vaccination does reduce transmission in the vaccinated there's some pesky new data that shows nasal swab levels of covid were the same for delta in vaccinated and unvaccinated confirmed cases.
https://reason.com/2021/07/29/what-does-the-unpublished-evidence-cited-by-the-cdcs-new-face-mask-guidance-actually-show/</p>
<p>Lockdowns, vaccine mandates and vaccine passports also effect people's health including people you love.</p>
<p>&rt;By refusing to get vaccinated</p>
<p>By refusing to join a medical trial under lack of future outcomes data available in order for me to provide informed consent.</p>
<p>&rt;you're not only putting yourself at risk but you've decided you're okay with gambling with their lives. Don't you see how selfish that is?</p>
<p>Simply existing while not sick is not a crime.  Nor is it selfish.  You are attempting to restrict my right to exist, speak, associate, freely travel, work, date, access medical care because I refuse to get a medical treatment.  Sounds like coercion, which is not compatible with informed consent.</p>
<p>On top of all that the vaccines don't provide sterilizing immunity so your two class medical segregated society will still see outbreak cases from the vaccinated even if all the unvaccinated were to say disappear.</p>
<p>&rt;As you must know we don't fully understand covid and have no way to know how it will affect those people years later that might have only gotten minor symptoms or no symptoms at all.</p>
<p>Agreed.  Sars screwed some people up longterm.  That's a legitimate risk.</p>
<p>&rt;We do however understand how the immune system generally works</p>
<p>Lets say I'm concerned with future ADE reactions of other strains with the spike protein predominately affecting the vaccinated. Could you help me out with some data showing that is impossible or extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>&rt;the risk analysis is simple in this case, yet so many people like you are refusing to put any logic or thinking into it.</p>
<p>No it isn't.  This is about freedom of choice.  We give them vaccine passports, mandatory vaccines and medical segregation the logical end game is democide and a technocrat run police state.  The deaths from covid pale compared to the deaths from democide even in the last decade.</p>
<p>Here's the thing I'll never comply, you'll have to beg the government to hold us down and inject us under duress.  Why not skip the outsourcing of violence to the police and come do it yourself ?</p>

        <p>You keep pretending you're against this because you don't want to be part of a trial. Forget for a minute that emergency FDA approval is only done after trials are done and shown to be safe. Will you get the vaccine once it is FDA approved?</p>
<p>Over 1 billion people have gotten the vaccine (one billion with a "B"). You can't cite a single case where someone died from it and the adverse reactions are so tiny they're insignificant (less than 0.01%). These adverse reactions are way less dangerous than the reactions to covid.</p>
<p>If you believe this is a trial this is the largest trial ever taken in history of any drug or vaccine. We'll be a year into that trial at the end of this year. If by December it's clear the vaccine is safe based on the results we see from what at that point will be billions of people will you get the vaccine then? No? Then explain to me how much time do you need and what other medication/vaccine that you've used you've applied that standard to.</p>
<p>Finally I didn't say you're a criminal for gambling with the lives of the loved ones around you. I simply said you're selfish, which is exactly what you are. And being selfish seems to be a virtue for a ton of people like you these days. </p>
<p>Even if your absurd belief that this is a trial is true wouldn't that mean anyone getting the vaccine is a hero for letting such an important vaccine be tested on them? So be a hero, stop being a coward.</p>

        <p>It’s hard to think critically or outside the box right? You’ve never associated the 600 000 thousand deaths to a glaring reality that in the US, and for that matter, all of western culture, we have a massive obesity problem… so much so, that it kills more than starvation right now… what’s even more insidious… is that it is promoted and normalized in a corportocracy led existence… lol it’s nice to think Russians or North Koreans are brainwashed by the state but theres no way a westerner can’t be… lol… a “western altruist” should be an oxymoron at this point… </p>
<p>You just keep cradling yourself thinking the most enlightened pharmeceutical scientists or the pinnacle of intellectualism in the realm of genetics cant sometimes overlook things or worse get something wrong… is it too scary to admit that the <em>slightest</em> variable or nuance could’ve been overlooked even with the best intentions… or you just piously believe in their abilities… like there’s no way we as a species tend to collectively have our heads so far up our asses to think we can control nature or an <em>endemic</em> virus at this point with a manmade medical technology… </p>
<p>Or if you want to scoff off the very real potential for antibody dependant enhancement and the implications thereof… that’s cool too… </p>
<p>If you want to deny the reality… and fauci’s recent statements suggesting the viral load in vaxxed and unvaxxed recipients who catch covid is exactly the same… it’s only that the vaxxed have less severe symptoms… so even if you segregated all the vaxxed from unvaxxed… ya know “medical apartheid” something you brown shirts really want right now, the virus will continue to mutate in the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike… since it’s endemic now… </p>
<p>You don’t want to consider the law of declining virulence… you don’t want to consider that dwindling hospitalizations attributed to vaccine success which we can admit they are… could also be attributed to natural immunity and or a combination of the two… </p>
<p>You don’t want to think that doctors and specialists that have raised “concern” and “speculate” that some downsides to mass vaccination could have some potential adverse and unforeseen consequences… even when they admit to there “concerns” and admit it’s “speculation” they’re still labelled quacks, censored or silenced… even though this very notion of contrarian thought in debate and discussion is a <em>pillar</em> of the scientific method!! </p>
<p>If you don’t think it’s strange that the vaccine campaign and resources attributed to all its marketing and advertising could’ve “equally” been met with just as much of an emphasis on empowering people with healthy lifestyles EI eating 10 servings of fruit and veggies a day… daily exercise… balanced diets… and an aversion to processed foods and too much meats and the profound impacts a healthy lifestyle has on increasing youre chances from avoiding hospitalization from covid… and basically every other known disease and sickness associated with poor lifestyle and nutrition… maybe people would be more trusting of big pharma and govt… but no it seemed that way of thinking is a little bit to opposing to corporate ideals… </p>
<p>if you’re at risk, extremely unhealthy, and want to continue smoking or eating fast food everyday for lunch… and don’t want to exercise or improve your overall personal life then by all means take the vaccine… and you’re right people can still take precautions… social distance… wear masks… not walk into old age homes with pre licked popcycles to hand out… </p>
<p>I’m wondering have you seen the protests happening right now in Europe like France, Italy and the UK? You don’t find it worrisome that it’s not reported by mainstream media? That news on issues and events like that should be <em>objective</em> regardless of your covid outlook… because it happens to be a “truth” that is going on in the world… you don’t find that censorship strange?? </p>
<p>Even as new data surfaces daily… all I ask… is to explore other narratives or information maybe it’s a mix of truth from everything… broaden your horizons… I read the exact same mainstream narrative… the established doctrines put out by doctors and scientists on msm, r/coronavirus, CNN, that you do… more so I try to be conscious that’s it’s all propaganda FOX is, the NNN is, every goddamn media platform is… but which ones are completely non partisan? Independant? I don’t know…. Maybe a transparent debate would help? Otherwise… I know I could be wrong… led astray… cognitive dissonant… dunning Kruger afflicted hypocrit… do you ever question yourself? Or the experts? You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to do so… which leads us to the other problem that we tend to look down on uneducated people.. demean them… to a point where the narrative right now suggests that they don’t even deserve a voice… it’s fucked up</p>

<p>I have, I live in Europe. E: And it is reported by mainstream media as well</p>
<p>&rt;Even as new data surfaces daily… all I ask… is to explore other narratives or information maybe it’s a mix of truth from everything… broaden your horizons… I read the exact same mainstream narrative… the established doctrines put out by doctors and scientists on msm, r/coronavirus, CNN, that you do… more so I try to be conscious that’s it’s all propaganda FOX is, the NNN is, every goddamn media platform is… but which ones are completely non partisan?

<p>That's literally why I'm here, to explore your narratives and see what drives you to this amount of distrust</p>
<p>It's not hard to think outside the box. I think the "hard" part is knowing when to do it. That's the critical thinking part. It's very very difficult, I agree with you on that entirely</p>
<p>If you wanted to really talk about things, it's not a good start to patronise and put words in my mouth</p>
<p>I trust my government, and our health officials. They are experts in their field. You will probably say I'm a fool to do so, but that is my simple explanation to you. This leads me to an easy conclusion as to whether I should take the vaccine or not, and the simple answer is yes, because I don't want to put friends, family and friends' families, or anyone at all at risk. If i trust the word of our health officials, then the best way to avoid that is to get vaccinated and follow our common guidelines</p>
<p>Yes, that includes proper nutrition as well as standard vitamins and all, and yes that is general advice in my country always. Nothing has changed</p>
<p>Now you know my side of the story. I think our biggest difference is simply whether we have trust in our governments or not</p>

        <p>Well For me, when I was 21 years old I was perfectly healthy and about to start a new school year of college studying oil painting  when I collapsed in the Dr's office following Hep B vaccination.  My life was never the same.  Two days later while cooking breakfast I suffered a major stroke.  I lost the ability to use the right side of my body.  I had multiple blood clots in the year following and eventually was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis as well. I had to drop out of college and spent the rest of my 20's trying to recover.  The medical industry was oh so happy to take me for all I was worth during this time and even with insurance I accrued tens of thousands of medical bills.  On that predatory industry note, my mom was having migraines when she was in her early 30's and the Dr's prescribed her Benzodiazepenes, now those drugs have destroyed her life and she is unable to stop taking them without having seizures, even after completing medical detox programs.  They are now trying to outlaw those drugs .  The condition my mom had was now shown to be a B12 deficiency .. they did not even LOOK for any causes only wanted to sell her drugs basically.  Please let's not pretend people don't have very. very valid reasons for mistrusting Big Pharmaceutical, an industry more comparable to Big Tobacco than any other . A corporate machine that  has demonstrably put profit over people time and time and time again not to mention taken quite the wrecking ball to my own life and in many ways unfortunately defined it.  That's lovely that the same companies which brought us the Opioid Epidemic are now saving the world and you don't have any questions.  But please don't pretend that there is not any reason to question when profits of the magnitude we are seeing ---33.5 billion alone for Pfizer this year--are involved.  That is a dangerously naive attitude which quite frankly ignores all of recorded history.</p>

        <p>Also, in general WORKING CLASS people (and I mean REAL blue collar working class-- I come from coal miners in West Virginia) and minorities mistrust the government because historically we've been totally screwed by it and have experienced that in real time, day after day after day.  Most people I know who unquestioningly support these dictates and proclamations from the govt, come from well-off backgrounds where they have never happened to truly find themselves at the mercy of their own government , only to realize the extent of the lack of concern or care.  White collar liberal workers in Ivory Towers don't understand the govt mistrust quite simply because they have never been in a vulnerable position where the govt could choose to help or harm them and the govt has chosen harm over and over again.  So they live in a fantasy world where nothing is corrupted and health officials tell the truth and nothing is influenced by money.  I'd like to see those individuals live ONE YEAR in the life of a REAL WORKING CLASS person subjected to the whims of government with no safety net and see how they feel about all this after that.  I was a lifelong progressive before this happened, which is why I live in Santa Cruz, California . I was vehemently anti- Trump. Now I am so ashamed I ever voted blue and will never make that mistake again nor will many of my friends.</p>

        <p>In Canada right now nothing gets reported… most people do not know of the civil unrest in Europe there is no mention of it… it is completely omitted from local news reports. </p>
<p>Everything I’ve mentioned above is the reason for my reservations regarding the vaccine… however, I like you, still conduct mayself following safety regulations and restrictions… I mask, social distance and avoid any unnessary interaction… </p>
<p>For a personal example, I work with a gentlemen that outright denies covids existence… he is in his mid fifties… smokes a pack a day… is overweight and doesn’t exercise, in my mind I believe he should consider the vaccine… however I’d feel odd forcing the vaccine on him… or telling him how to eat and live his life… it’s his decision to make… however it is the most altruistic thing to do no? </p>
<p>I think another thing to consider is your “walk of life”… I’ve had to work through the pandemic in private aviation… medical contracts in organ tranfer, medical personnel, and patient tranfers have deemed us essential, not to mention the faceless millionaires who got to travel with impunity… so I’ve worked through the pandemic, my wife lost half her business and had to make ends meet by having to work half her clientele through video sessions (personal trainer) 1 on 1 with her own studio which could have been easily controlled with distancing measures and mask mandates… in fact all small businesses could’ve conducted business with easier enforced regulations then the huge corporate stores such as wal mart, etc… where mask mandates are an act of theatre or ballyhoo… most people are ok with any type of face covering even though proper mask mandates need an approved N95 style mask… but I digress… it makes people feel safe… even when it droops under the nose or people touch and adjust them and pull them down to reiterate miscommunication… however throughout our lockdowns you could still book a massage… what has your personal experience been like?</p>

<p>I don’t think your a fool for taking the vaccine at all… I think it’s beneficial for those “at risk”. I don’t know you’re medical history… and if your decision is a sense of altruism and you’re belief that it lessens your detriment on your family and community I’d have to disagree… with what we know now the vaccine actually puts demographics of people who have taken it into a false sense of comfort… the viral load is the same in vaccinated and unvaccinated… you’d just have less severe symptoms but could still spread it… hence why the cdc recommends vaccinated continue to wear masks… we also have to worry about ADE in the years to come… especially since countries are already being preemptive with booster shots… like my prime minister who has purchased them from Pfizer until 2024</p>

        <p>If they can scare the population to the point where they are willing to inject foreign chemicals into their veins that alter your DNA, they have the power to do anything they want to them.  Your life may not have changed, but people have died from the vaccine, miscarried, suffered brain bleed, paralysis, and a whole slew of side effects.  All that and now they bring back masks?  And now they also say the vaccinated can spread covid just as easily as the unvaccinated, but in the same breath they tell you to get the shot.  It's all ABOUT power, I don't understand how you can't see that.  Their mandates were never voted on, never codified, and one by one were struck down by the state Supreme Court in certain areas of the country.  Why do you think that is?</p>

        <p>You're correct, it wasn't. JHU study showed all cause mortality wasn't any different than any other year, even when you broke it down into age ranged cohorts. It got quickly redacted and corrected because it didn't fit the narrative, but it's still out there last I checked. Sorry to break it to everyone using deceased friends and family as the crux of giving this bullshit legitimacy, your Grams or morbidly obese friend was gonna die this year either way.</p>

        <p>You mean that JHU economics professor that gave an online presentation about it?</p>
<p>&rt; Woolf said in an email that the lecture video instead presented a “very unsophisticated analysis, in which the speaker uses crude death counts for one year (2018) as the basis for comparison and performs simple subtraction from 2020 values for her assertions. Any reputable analysis of excess deaths is based on statistical modeling that computes seasonal averages over a period of many years, and this is done to adjust for random variation from year to year.”</p>
<p>&rt; “For example, our studies use Poisson regression modeling. Statistical modeling is necessary to know whether differences in death counts are statistically significant,” he said. “The speaker admits to merely eyeballing the trend lines for 2020. Researchers prefer to use statistical modeling to know whether a supposed change in counts is random variation or a statistically significant trend.”</p>
<p>I’m glad you like to spread the words of an economics professor who can subtract over statistics professors who actually compared the mortality across multiple years to normalize and account for random variation.</p>

        <p>Na, it was a research paper, not a lecture from an economics prof. Big fails for joo. There's also no reason to account for random, seasonal variation: the numbers were nearly identical in 2020 and 2019.</p>

<p>Think about that and self reflect. It seems like that’s a case of turning your back on studies when it doesn’t fit your own narrative REGARDLESS of the stats. Which I’ve seen a lot on this sub....</p>
<p>No, I’m here trying to understand why people like you here favor one narrative with statistically insignificant evidence over the others with much more evidence and research. Obviously the top layer of the onion is because one fits my narrative and the other doesn’t. But digging deeper, is it because of an ego problem? Is it from trying to not fit in with what mainstream thinks? Is it distrusting the government because in my past, I have had my trust betrayed? Idk, that’s why I’m on this sub trying to figure out and understand....</p>

<p>Because I've been to college, I've seen the brainwashing factories they are, and understand how money/influence works. One of my mentors works as a professor at a local university, and openly broadcasts his disdain for the total lack of integrity when it comes to externally funded research and university transparency. He laughs every time someone references scientific studies and asks "Yeah? Who paid for the grant? Oh, wonder if the results are in line with their agenda".</p>
<p>&rt; is it because of an ego problem? Is it from trying to not fit in with what mainstream thinks? Is it distrusting the government because in my past, I have had my trust betrayed?</p>
<p>I have worked for the US government for 16 years in a mid-high level capacity. In that time, I've sat in on enough TS briefs and read official documentation that directly contradicts the released cover stories for said events. I'm not talking aliens, or lizard people, or any other of that nonsense. What we're talking about isn't secrets in late night History channel sense, it's more 1984-Ministry of Truth shit. All of the events of the last 3 years have gone down in line with national destabilization publications we use against other countries. I've been involved in enough unconventional warfare in other nations to know when it's being used at home, or in this case, worldwide.</p>
<p>I'm distrustful of the government because I deal with our nation's lies on a daily basis. While some of the shit on this sub is legit tinfoil hat garbage, some of it is not far off from the truth. 20 years ago, I fully believed that our country was the unequivocal good guys. In the last 10, yeah, not so much. </p>
<p>There's an entire thread stickied here with all the accumulated research documents. I dare you to read all of them. But first, consider looking places other than just "the science" at the loudest political figures screaming for masks, while they are photographed days later at "super-spreader events", no mask in sight. Of the recent G7 conference where cameras rolling as everyone doing elbow bumps and standing as far away as the camera can handle, only to be hugging and grasping shoulders inches away as soon as they think they're off the air. Look to the obvious: that it's all a choreographed act, and flat out propaganda. If you're truly interested in seeing the other side, then actually try. </p>
<p>My stance is entirely devoid of ego: it's the antithesis of how wrong I was 20 years ago.</p>

        <p>Fuck concerts.. weren't even worth going to before covid.    Nothing like standing in a room/Field full of people draped all over you, what an experience 🤣🙄</p>
<p>P.S. sorry, I know lots of people still like concerts..I worked in the music industry for quite a few years (before switching to maintenance), I'm over it. I'll listen to a song just a handful times a year.. much rather listen to talk radio these days.</p>

        <p>Concerts aren't for everyone but we always had a good time at this.  I'm out of touch with all of the latest bands so I'd make a little project about researching bands and getting familiar with the acts we wanted to see by making playlists.</p>
<p>Because they moved the data to the Fall it will be around the same time Hardly Strictly happens so hopefully we can just go to that which is always free admission instead assuming it will be held again this year.</p>

        <p>Hey - not to be weird but these were some key readings which I think you should see and gave me deeper views on last year , on amplitude cycles https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html and at the end of last year the WHO finally provided new accurate guidance on how to process samples and all the sudden numbers crashed (around the same time as vaccine became available) https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2020/cdc_updates_faqs_to_include_info_on_cycle_threshold_values.html  and Bill Gates has a favorite book ‘How to Lie with Statistics’ which is too good a detail ( https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/How-to-Lie-with-Statistics) , but there are good scientists proving asymptomatic spread didn’t happen among 10 million samples https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w prospective similarity between covid 19 spike proteins and human endemic retroviruses used in reproduction https://virological.org/t/response-to-ncov2019-against-backdrop-of-endogenous-retroviruses/396 sketchiness with labeling deaths as covid without covid test result for CARES $ubsidies https://www. (Gate way pundit ) .com/2020/04/huge-mn-senator-dr-reveals-hhs-document-coaching-overcount-covid-19-cases-copy-document-video/ and it associated document - read Conclusion - https://www.scribd.com/document/455607875/US-HHS-Document-to-Doctors-on-How-to-Certify-COVID-19-Deaths-including-Related-Deaths  Kaiser has also had amazing reporting - in particular about the private health care companies takes billions/trillions in the name of covid (and not providing Universal Healthcare) https://khn.org/news/article/covid-relief-law-health-insurance-boost-aca-cost-analysis/  and then there is the DARPA side of all this , American military hiring out Chinese labs to do research on gain of function viruses (https://unlimitedhangout.com/2020/04/investigative-series/all-roads-lead-to-dark-winter/) and of course you must be familiar with Event 201 the pre pandemic rehearsal in 2019 (https://hub.jhu.edu/2019/11/06/event-201-health-security/) this is sadly a long and complicated story I won’t even going as far as Fauci forcing AZT down aids patients throat even tho it was killing the patients and making it punishable by law to pursue other treatments https://www.huffpost.com/entry/whitewashing-aids-history_b_4762295  (gay history lesson/Dallas Buyers Club) apparently his wife is the head of ethics for who which must be a joke, as are his obvious lies about funding Peter Daszak and the Chinese bat last  -  https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/ - they may claim not to fund Gain of Function viruses but ecohealth alliance just uses in lab species to species transfer to achieve the jumping up to human, like an organic style compared to literal genome GOF - - Also there was a leaked phizer study from Japan which showed the vax accumulated into ovaries of rats https://www.pmda.go.jp/drugs/2021/P20210212001/672212000_30300AMX00231_I100_1.pdf it’s in japanese but the tables in English show the numbers. Pretty scary given how many women report strange post menopausal bleeding experiences (even younger ladies) after vaccination. And many doctors observed sperm counts dropping like rocks and stops sperm generation from the virus itself - COVID-19 disrupts spermatogenesis through the oxidative stress pathway following induction of apoptosis 
The virus enters via the ACE2. Cell receptor which incidentally is blocked by 420 ❤️ ace2 density is highest in our reproductive organs which is crazy BC Gates and his Sanger family of planned parenthood fame have always had an angle towards depopulation just generally of non white people. And non white people have suffered the most in this crises. Anyway, risks outweigh reward here. Stay healthy take vitamins, be healthy and use your own eyes and ears to inform your truth not the same news networks and agencies which told you Trump isn’t a criminal. </p>

        <p>so vaccinated people don't need to be tested, but can be spreaders.  And they want to get all the not sick, unvaccinated people to stand in close proximity to the vaccinated spreaders....so that the unvaccinated won't get sick because they tested negative orginally?</p>
<p>I mean even pretending for a minute that you can easily get covid at an outdoor event....their logic still leads to a zero value added policy while forcing medical testing on people who wouldn't have otherwise needed it.</p>

        <p>I’m jabbed (and regret it) but I will never use that status to to prolong this tyranny.</p>
<p>I stand in solidarity with everyone yearning for true medical freedom.  These are dark days but we must unify and refuse to comply with anyone enabling this disgusting segregation.</p>
<p>Hell, I expect to join the ranks of those “dirty unvaxxed” when I tell them to fuck off with a booster shot.  I expect it to become mandatory.  I’ll probably lose my job or something but I don’t care.</p>
<p>I want freedom.</p>
<p>Yeah Branch Covidians.  I’d love some of them freedumbs.  Peaceful divorce may be the only option at this point.  You can live in constant fear of some virus (that I caught and recovered from just fine) and stay in your covid loop.</p>
<p>Is there an island or country somewhere for us that just wanna live our damn lives?  Give me dangerous freedom over tyranny.  This oppression is killing my soul and I don’t like it.</p>
