    <strong>Lives &gt; Economy thinkers</strong>
    <p><p>How are these people not understanding that a healthy economy is detrimental to our survival? My province released additional measures and all these people who think they can run things better keep saying that our government values jobs more than lives.</p>
<p>How can someone be for saving lives from the virus, but not care about saving lives from poverty? Not to mention the surging rates of mental health decline and suicide. </p>
<p>I’m utterly emotionally exhausted. Please tell me it’s just Reddit filled with idiots, and not the whole world?!?</p></p>

        <p>Most privileged asshats pushing for lockdowns think the economy is just numbers in their stock portfolios. They think their nice WFH salary will always be there. These are the people who made memes in the spring about rednecks wanting to “be selfish and go back to their shitty minimum wage factory jobs” as if they go to work for fun. These are the people who expect everyone to lock down but still want food at their grocery store stocked and delivered to them and still want restaurants churning out take out. They think anyone who wants to go back to work is just bored or dim, they use their minimum wage status as a slur against them, they think people just want haircuts and to eat out at Applebees, they don’t realize we’re watching entire industries crumble and jobs get eliminated that people won’t be able to return to. </p>
<p>These people are imbeciles who don’t understand how the world works beyond their front door. </p>
<p>The economy IS lives. It’s food on the table and a roof over your family’s head, it’s keeping health insurance for your family too.</p>

        <p>It's been a real eye opener and if i'm honest, I'm generally disappointed. It's actually sad how ignorant a lot of people seem to be with fundamental things like economics.</p>

        <p>It's not.  I used to a be a truck driver, and here in the US, that's the one job that underlies the whole economy- if you're not a subsistence farmer, your job flat-out doesn't <em>exist</em> with them.  Want to end the lockdowns?  Shut down the transportation sector.  Before the week's out, people will be at eat other's throats- and that's not a metaphor.</p>
<p>I've also been living-out-of-my-car poor.  I actually had a roof over my head, but that was due exclusively to chance.  I've survived- I can't call it living- off of plasma donations, and spent years knowing that one big unexpected expense could finish me off.  Money's like air and sex- it's only important when you're not getting any.  But when you're not...</p>

        <p>It's because they don't care about the economy. The virus came from China, orchestrated by the CCP. It's going to end up with everyone under socialism as soon as they inject enough people with the vaccine with the microchips.</p>
