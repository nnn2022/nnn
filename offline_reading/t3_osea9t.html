    <strong>How vaccination center work in a 3rd world country.</strong>
    <p><p>I've read about how vaccination center in the West are just basically anyone with a bit of training can jab people with a needle and I find this absurd so I want to shed some like how it works in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The government has always been always Authoritarian so let's skip the lockdown part.</p>
<p>But, vaccination centers are hospitals. There's clinical diagnosis and doctors run test to make sure you're a healthy individual with no medical problems like obesity, hypertension, etc. People WILL be refused the vaccination if their health doesn't meet the basic requirement. Doctors also talk very openly about the side effects because it's a fact and say there's no reason to get it if you're young and healthy. Why isn't this done everywhere ?  Would you have taken the shot if this was done ? This has always been a standard medical procedure and now it's just completely dropped, now everyone is expert that recommend everyone to get jabbed.</p>
<p>Now, this could change very soon because our government is really really stupid and we had a limited supply of vax available but at least almost every doctor I know understand that there are risks with every vaccine and if you're willing to get jabbed, the risk is on you.</p></p>
