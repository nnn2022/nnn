    <strong>Why is Freedom Worth Fighting For? End GENOCIDE Now.</strong>
    <p><p>Dear hearts. I hope you know how special you are and how unimaginably important you are to this world, to the lives of your family and friends. This is why we can NEVER give up speaking up for humanity. I applaud each and every one of you in your listening to your heart and mind and knowing something is WRONG with the dystopian nightmare placed upon us as the "new normal". Thank you for saying "no" to the brainwashing. For standing up for humanity. I am sharing with you a video I hope will encourage you to educate yourself on genocide as well as to be inspired to keep standing up for what you know is right. Tyranny can ONLY continue to exist with compliance. Keep pushing for open dialogue and science with integrity. Much love. </p>

<p>The NPC's have been trained to actively hate and fear freedom. Bring it up with them and they'll mock the very concept.</p>

        <p>It's very traumatic because then they must question if they themselves are free. And the best kind of slave is the one that doesn't know it's imprisoned...</p>

        <p>&rt;they must question if they themselves are free</p>
<p>That would imply that they give a shit in the first place or even understand what "freedom" means. Most these days are perfectly happy living in an assigned commie block and receiving UBI for the rest of their days as long as they have media to entertain them and a constant stream of hedonistic activities to partake in and spend their money on. They would rather have freedom from discomfort than freedom as it has been understood for the majority of western history.</p>
