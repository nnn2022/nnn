        <p>I do not understand peoples unwillingness to get together even for a once a year normally culturally huge meal. So you are saying you are not willing to take a not even 0.5% chance of getting infected with a diease with not even a 0.1% mortality rate to get together for Christmas? Glad to see how important family is to you..</p>

<p>You mean redditors. Reddit is full of people who just hate their family. No matter what sub you go to you'll see people just ranting. I have to wonder though, because most people on reddit strike me as really insufferable, if <em>they're</em> the ones with an issue.</p>
<p>Like I guarantee my sister comes here and bitches about my family but she's legitimately crazy with unchecked mental illness and fucking difficult to deal with.</p>

        <p>Lots of people have extremely abusive or neglectful families. In my case, I'm the only person in my family with my head screwed on correctly. But of course I can't vent about it because people like you assume that I'm the problem. Give people a break, you don't know what they've been through.</p>

        <p>Hey I'm not trying to attack people personally; I have a lot of friends who have come from really abusive situations so I know it's not out of the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>But when the majority of what you see on this site is overwhelmingly anti family you can't help but wonder. Especially since a lot of the posts the user just comes off extremely snotty and entitled. And maybe that's because of the subs I used to frequent. The age demographic for this site is 17 and under as well so that probably plays into it.</p>

        <p>I feel like there are fewer redditors saying, “My family is legitimately toxic and I’m avoiding them for the sake of my mental health,” than “So glad I can bail this year. Who needs real human contact when Netflix and video games exist? #introvert” (Social anxiety and agoraphobia =/= introversion. Not insulting agoraphobes either, I am one.)</p>

        <p>My mom died when I was 11. After that my family spiraled into some kind of bullshit. Everyone was mean and nasty. I became some sort of punching bag for everyone's misgivings. It sucked bad. Since then, things have improved drastically. Sure there were definitely bumps. In my 20s and early 30s I was always the topic of conversation on how much of a perceived trainwreck I was. One day I just spilled the beans on how tired of shit I was. Cut off someone for months. After that they seemed to come around. So now I can enjoy holidays more. I did feel like I was a problem for a long long time. I realized I wasn't. </p>
<p>I do see both sides of the coin though. Some people are effing delusional.</p>

        <p>Yup. And as a more closeted skeptic...I have to admit I definitely used covid as an excuse to get out of going to thanksgiving and my grandmas bday a few weeks ago (same people at both things). They were in the middle of my finals period, it’s a two hour drive one way, and all my life I (and my parents) have been the black sheep in that family and I’m just tired of going to these get togethers where it seems like they don’t actually like me much and there’s some bad blood with how they’ve treated me in the past (like turning a blind eye to my mental instability when I stayed with them to the point I had to call my parents across the country to help me out of a suicide attempt bc they didn’t care).  It worked like a charm. In some ways I feel bad, but also...I don’t. And everyone I know who decided not to see parents for the holidays has some serious issues with them and I can almost guarantee covid was the golden ticket of excuses. This excuse has become extremely addictive</p>

        <p>I know people like this, including my sister who said she didn't want to do Thanksgiving to protect my mom but them ended up going to her boyfriend's family. People just want excuses. They don't want to travel or give back to their parents'. They are lazy and selfish. So many entitled brats like this bc now they can commit to even fewer things. They don't have to be a part of anything even their own goddamn family. Fuck community, fuck your ties. Just being alone in your room on the internet caring about no one and doing nothing for anyone, including your own parents!!</p>

        <p>I am an older millenial and I just can't believe how many millenials simply can't commit. There have been times I've had to cancel things like when I would be up all night crying and felt like shit or my fridge went out and I had to buy new asap. I always feel bad about it though. I feel like covid is the grand poobah of excuses for these types of people.</p>

        <p>Dealing with this currently. My future SIL is refusing to come to our wedding in a few months but when I explain to her that my brother (who is an ICU doctor and been treating COVID patients) will be there sans mask with his small children it’s like her time spent in the house watching the fear mongering overrules his medical training. It makes my brain bleed trying to have an educated conversation with her at this point.</p>

        <p>Absolutely and it's not even a helpful suggestion... get the vaxx and then what? The vaxx doesn't even help with transmission, it maybe at best might help reduce the symptoms of the flu but then people that notice symptoms get it so mild anyways... Clown Planet</p>

        <p>This nurse I went to high school with is at disney world right now and also went on a few other vacations this year. This other nurse I know flew to a wedding in north carolina last week. Healthcare workers have lives too and many of them want to get on with their lives as well. Also fuck this dude, his mom has probably been working with covid patients all year and just wants to see her son. this guy probably just sits around all day playing xbox + ordering grubhub thus he thinks he’s some covid saint</p>

        <p>How sad. I have an in law family member who will come but she wears a mask. My kids don't understand why she's wearing it when no one else is and why they can't hug their auntie. It's ludacris. None of us want her to wear it and yet she still does. No one can say anything either because then she'd probably never come around again. UGH it's so freaking frustrating. She's not coming to Christmas Eve with the great-grandparents even though they DGAF. She's doing her part.</p>

        <p>My mom wouldn’t have Thanksgiving or Christmas with us.  She actually tried to give me an air hug on her birthday.  I was like, “fuck that”  and made her hug me.  And this is with masks on....in the house.  God, that’s embarrassing to even type.  Lol   Basically, she’s low key conveying the message that we’ll take her out by touching her or breathing the same air.  It sucks.  Idk what her deal is but she’s clearly watching way too much tv. She thinks she’s so in danger because she’s in the senior category.  My mom is healthy as a horse, mind you.  She’s just completely out of control with this.  But at the same time, she knows better than to trust a vaccine.  It’s so weird.  It’s like she can’t just make the full leap onto the side of complete rationality.</p>
