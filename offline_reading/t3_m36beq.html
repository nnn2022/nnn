    <strong>What I Don‚Äôt Understand About This Vaccine...</strong>
    <p><p>If you can still get and spread COVID after taking it then why should everybody get it? The whole idea surrounding herd immunity is pillared on the fact the if you‚Äôre vaccinated you can‚Äôt get or spread the disease you were vaccinated for. </p>
<p>And when the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù say that they aren‚Äôt sure if vaccinated folks can still spread it please know that this clearly means they can. A 3rd grader could devise an experiment to determine this. So they definitely know you can still spread it and just don‚Äôt want to say it. </p>
<p>So wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense for ONLY older people to get this shitty vaccine? Especially since data shows the elderly do better with the vaccine than Covid and young, healthy people do better with Covid than the vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>It‚Äôs not a traditional vaccine. More like gene therapy</p>

        <p>Well, no. The scientists behind this vaccine are probably okay. It‚Äôs the bureaucratic and corporate layers of bs laid on top of it that makes it have no logic behind it.</p>
<p>Take the idea of ‚Äòvaccine passports‚Äô for example. Moderna spent $280 million on political lobbying last year (source 1). Tell me how forcing people to get the moderna vaccine in order to travel doesn‚Äôt have a clear conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Or how they say we might need more than one round of shots. Or more masks. Or more face shields. Or more hand sanitizer. The fat cats of the American healthcare system have found a gold mine, and they intend to ride on it for as long as they can.</p>

        <p>It's no use debating them on this point. They set the rules of the discussion, they control the test data, they pay very smart people to come up with a narrative and then use their propaganda machine to force these ideas onto you.</p>
<p>It's like in war, if you start a rebellion you don't fight battles in the open, it's a lost cause, point and case and expert who questions the narrative loses their license and credibility. You have to fight to your strengths.</p>
<p>That's why I focus on the legal side on things, because there they don't have a leg to stand on, and they are blatantly hiding information. Which is why they can never force this on people, because this would not hold up in court for more than a hot second. It's also why these "vaccines" will never go beyond experimental status, because if they're approved then the producers and governments become liable, and they can't have that.</p>
