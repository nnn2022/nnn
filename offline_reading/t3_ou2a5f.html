        <p>People communicate meaning through language.  You're getting hung up on implying things that aren't intended because you ignore the language.</p>
<p>The % positive for covid are only like 5% out of all the tests taken.  People go in with all kinds of symptoms and they do not get a positive.  So it's not as simple as 'popping' a positive because it 'finds something'.</p>
<p>The false positive happens when the cycle thresholds are run at 40 and it starts picking up 'dead' or 'broken' genetic material that isn't indicative of infection or an ability to transmit.</p>

<p>Can you share what leads you to believe the current PCR test IS able to differentiate between Flu and CV-19?  Reading that line from the linked article, it is reasonable to infer the test being pulled cannot differentiate.</p>

        <p>Their current kit is not able to differentiate, because (according to the CDC) it is not first able to DETECT flu.  It is a "sars-cov-2 only" test.</p>
<p>"Differentiate" is not a term that is used when talking about tests that are alleged to detect a single agent.<br>
"Detect and differentiate" is only used when talking about multiplex tests, which is the context in which it was used in this lab notice.<br>
The interpretation that's running amok has to do with confirmation bias and an unwillingness to look at what they objectively are trying to convey to labs.</p>
<p>Why people think the CDC would casually 'admit' that their tests read influenza viruses as sars-cov-2 really escapes me.  It's infinitely more likely that what is being said is simply being misinterpreted to align with a certain bias - NOT that I personally feel this bias is unwarranted. I say all this apart from my own personal opinions in regard to the PCR tests, how they work, and how they have been interpreted.  </p>
<p>I'm just taking a step back and acknowledging that the CDC's intent w/ this notice is worlds apart from how it is being interpreted by very opinionated and (rightfully) distrusting people.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why people think the CDC would casually 'admit' that their tests read influenza viruses as sars-cov-2 really escapes me.</p>
<p>What are the metrics being used to justify business shutdowns, lockdowns, masks, etc. Could it have been the rolling, 7-day positivity rate? I know in my local jurisdiction, it is [still] reported EVERY DAY by the health department what the "positivity rate" is in the county. This is the positivity rate of SARS-CoV-19, <strong>NOT</strong> the flu. If the test cannot differentiate between the two, then we are being misled about the severity of the situation (it is the flu that is being picked up by the test, not CV-19), and the justifications for the restrictions. </p>
<p>There were countless articles in the last 6 months about the absence of flu being used to justify these restrictive policies (see a small sample of examples below). <strong>Yes, this is a casual admittance that the test failed to properly detect CV-19.</strong> The test frequently misidentified the flu as SARS-CoV-19. That is exactly what the CDC article is saying. Please share anything you can that states the PCR test is capable of making this differentiation, or that the PCR test IS NOT identifying the flu as CV-19. You already stated it is designed to identify a single agent.</p>

        <p>That isn't what it's saying, which I've already described at length.  It's just TERMINOLOGY that you refuse to interpret in the context it is routinely used.</p>
<p>Nowhere in that release does it say their test misidentified the flu as SARS-CoV-2.  You are just implying that because you, again, are misappropriating the use of the words. I've explained already that they only use the words 'detect and differentiate' when they are testing for multiple things in ONE test. This is not the same as being able to correctly identify the presence of one particular agent.</p>
<p>I don't think the metrics are justified for the reasons they allege and I don't think it has anything to do with 'public health'. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Results are for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 <strong>RNA.</strong> SARS-CoV-2 RNA is generally detectable in upper and lower respiratory specimens during infection. <strong>Positive results are indicative of active infection with SARS-CoV-2</strong> <strong><em>but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses</em></strong><strong>.</strong> <strong><em>The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.</em></strong> Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all results to the appropriate public health authorities.</p>
