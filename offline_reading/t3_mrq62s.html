    <strong>I'm tired of people thinking they're doing me a favor.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everybody; this is a throwaway account because I can't log into my original account for some reason (sorry about that, and apologizes if this does not make much sense I'll try not to make it be too much word vomit)</p>
<p>To preface, I am 24 and have medical conditions that have made my immune system compromised. They aren't a fault of my own, but they are something I deal with, have dealt with, and will deal with for the rest of my life on a daily basis. I take care of myself the best I can by eating right, exercising, and taking my medications, but everyday can present  new challenges with my illnesses. Nonetheless, I'm considered an 'immunocompromised' person. </p>
<p>Something that has been getting under my skin throughout all of this are people throwing the term 'immunocompromised' around, and making the notions that if somebody like me would ever dare to go outside, I would die.  And a huge reason why people are doing lockdowns/etc. are supposedly for people like me. It seems incredibly performative to me, especially within the government mandating these laws/regulations for the 'sake' of immunocompromised people. </p>
<p>I think this way because my medications for my illnesses are <strong><em>thousands</em></strong> of dollars, and if I did not have good insurance, I would be fucked and dead within a week at best. People have died because of a lack of access to medical care or medications; there are countless news articles talking about it. Governmental agencies have at least some leverage to combat the price-gauging of the things that are proven to keep me alive, but don't do anything, due to so much greed between them and Big Pharma. They would let me, and others with the same conditions as me, die because we aren't able to cough-up thousands every month for the medications and supplies deemed necessary. </p>
<p>It's ironic, too, because at the beginning of the pandemic, I was incredibly worried for my health. I remember seeing videos from Wuhan of people dropping like flies in the street. I have extreme anxiety too, especially when it comes to my health. I always have been this way. When I shared my concerns with people, they would say "Don't worry, it just affects immunocompromised people." As if they weren't talking to somebody who fits into that category. They don't actually care about me and my health, it feels more so like they want to feel like they are doing some sort of civic duty by going along with everything. </p>
<p>I've also had people talk down to me about my illnesses and treat me like I'm my diseases, rather than just a person. If I show any symptoms that I cannot help showing, people have said the nastiest things to me. But now, people are promoting all of these regulations that I never asked to be made at my/everybody's expense. 'Immunocompromised' has become such a buzzword for people to feel so righteous and give themselves a pat on the back, even though at the end of this, my medication prices will still be inflated, I will still have to deal with my sicknesses with no cure (or much research going into developing one), and deal with people being really misinformed, disingenuous, and downright nasty when they actually interact with me, a sick person. I'm not contagious. Just sick. You can't catch what I have, but people believe that they will catch COVID from me or vise versa, even when they (or myself, in this instance) aren't sick. </p>
<p>Does this make sense what I'm saying? Sorry if this was just confusing to read. I thought this would be a good place to share my feelings about this. I don't dare bring it up with anybody else, as I think it's quite an unpopular stance amongst people with various medical conditions like mine. </p>
<p>Thank you for reading. I hope you're having a good day (or night) wherever you are.</p></p>
