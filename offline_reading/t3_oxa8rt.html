    <strong>“Precovid” is equivalent of “pre-9/11”</strong>
    <p><p>War on Terrorism = War on  Disease. See the similarities? Other common phrases would be,</p>
<p>“Global pandemic” 
“The new normal”
“We’re all in this together”
“Trust the science”
“Do not panic, we just want you safe”</p></p>

        <p>The main difference is the "war on terror" eventually became extremely unpopular. The "war on disease" is still quite popular. Lets hope it becomes as unpopular as the "war on terror".</p>

        <p>Unfortunate, we certainly are not 'all in it together' as the divide and conquer has worked so well (let alone the absolute and ultimate minority 'elite' that are actually doing this to us). The manipulated naive majority are being turned against the free and critical thinking - it's barely a fair fight. </p>
<p>The way this has been orchestrated is so that the most resistant and opposed to this new regime are going to be singled out and torn apart by their own side essentially, their own neighbours, friends, brothers and sisters. </p>
<p>It's quite quite sinister. Classic divide and conquer to the absolute letter.</p>

        <p>Might I add that once whatever is coming is done with and just a part of history, the said majority who did the controllers bidding are simply going to claim (and frighteningly rightly so) that they were 'JUST DOING WHAT THEY WERE TOLD'.</p>
<p>There is a clear pattern here, there are a multitude of very scary and outright horrific events throughout history where this has been the case unfortunately. </p>
<p>It seems that people by and large (often no matter how smart or nice they can be) are just fundamentally quite simple and easy to manipulate.</p>

        <p>The war on terrorism was the never ending war, the war against an invisible and all pervasive enemy who could be anywhere at any time. It was those in powers wet dream for a constant state of emergency, with which they could write infinite blank cheques, wage illegal wars, and bring in whatever draconian  domestic laws they desired.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, and here we are with a global virus.
This virus is the ultimate invisible and all pervasive enemy that is all around you all the time and is never going away.</p>
<p>The parallels are astounding. The war against the virus is the war on terrorism x1000 on steroids.</p>

        <p>There was a presentation by Pascal in 2019 about China's New Normal. It was about how Chinese tech was revolutionizing how Chinese people lived and organized their life. It's really fascinating, I recommend the watch on YouTube.</p>
<p>It's just interesting that Biden and Obama claimed that China never invented anything and just copied what they saw, back in 2014. This was naive and arrogant.</p>
<p>I get the suspicion that they're trying to fast forward the west to catch-up to China. By this I'm referring to installing obedience (which is a big mistake, because china's Confucius history and their CCP earned their people's respect via the political system's internal meritocracy and numerous public survey questionnaires; this can't just be 'adopted in a western country'), and forcing people to stay home and figure out how to operate an economy completely online.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this. I've long suspected that the West was always in awe of the Chinese model, despite them constantly criticising it.</p>
<p>The West is not the East also as you say, there are many differences.</p>
