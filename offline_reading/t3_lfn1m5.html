        <p>I'm in a similar position. </p>
<p>My partner often just gets angry and refuses to discuss verifiable facts or simply tells me I'm wrong or calls me "just a conspiracy theorist". She seems to know deep down that a lot of this stuff is bullshit and can't actually debate the science or facts with me, but says "well we needed change anyways". I think she's just afraid and the bigger issue is almost all of her friends are very left leaning so it's a conformity thing for her -- she doesn't want to stand out.</p>
<p>There's also the smug feeling of superiority calling others "uneducated" and "trump supporters".</p>
<p>She hated trump so much that now that biden is in I think she just prefers to look the other way. Especially because she wants to conform to her social group/friends.</p>

        <p>See that's the biggest distinction I try to point out to her everyday.</p>
<p>There is a difference between education and ability to discern factual information.</p>
<p>Education is only as useful as what those doing the "educating" are teaching.</p>
<p>It's why so many doctors are seen as unquestionable paragons of holiness in this new scientism religion. They went through the priesthood and have attained the holy title of MD.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if their allopathic training leaves much to be desired when it comes to side effects of drugs prescribed, or dangers of vaccines. It doesn't matter that doctors receive very little training in vaccination beyond the basics and that they're "safe and effective".</p>
<p>This all goes back to Rockefeller essentially buying medical colleges in the US, creating the precursor AMA, and redefining "medicine" as being about prescribing drugs and surgery (and later vaccination).</p>
<p>For thousands of years healers and medicine men and women knew the best way to promote health and wellness was to look at the body holistically.</p>
<p>Ever since Rockefeller and his colleges redefined what "medicine" meant, we have seen a slow and steady decline in health over generations. </p>
<p>Today holistic doctors are few and far between, and have to go receive "alternative" education.</p>
<p>This entire scam would not be possible without people viewing "education" and "experts" as the end all be all. Thinking for oneself and looking at the bigger picture be damned!</p>

        <p>I can relate to an extent. I’ve been called a conspiracy theorist by my husband and I’ve had some heated arguments because his parents think people who don’t want the Covid vaccine are selfish. He tends to side with them and he refuses to hear my logic. He just gets mad. It’s gotten milder over time, but we don’t agree on anything.</p>

        <p>Not a spouse but a significant other. She got pretty upset with me when I expressed that I wouldn't be getting the vaccine, and doesn't like that I don't wear a mask. Definitely frustrating. I don't think she fully understands the gravity of all of this though...I don't think she is wise to the fact that I DO think the virus is real. I am well aware that it's real, I'm well aware that it's deadly. I just would rather not take my chances with an unpredictable vaccine, and don't see any reason to wear a mask</p>

        <p>Oh I've tried. It's tough to get through to people though, people don't want there to be compromise. Either it's the end of the world or it doesn't exist. Can't be anything in between. I don't know, we'll see what happens. A year from now one of us will be right and the other won't, until then there's really no sense in arguing too much about it</p>

        <p>I'm single and still very much in love with my ex. I am so disappointed in her right now though. She's Team Mask, posts stuff like "wear your damn mask" on FB, complained on FB about neighbors having a party, agreed with local gov't cancelling one of their biggest annual events. However I have never heard her advocate for violence - either by private citizens or the state - against non corona cultists. I have never heard her advocate for private citizens or businesses being forbidden from activities (or forced to wear masks) due to the pandemic.</p>

        <p>People can have whatever beliefs they want, but if he is calling you names and putting you down, that is totally unacceptable and you may want to reevaluate if you really want this guy in your life.  This is not just disagreeing.  He is mistreating you.</p>

        <p>100% divorce like the others are saying. He's a sheep that'll never be convinced. Best bet to treat the relationship from now on as one where he is an abuser. Consolidate you stuff and leave asap.</p>

        <p>Is he at risk? Are you living with sick elderly people? If not, or if you are and they don't mind, go outside and live your life how you please. He can come with you or he won't, its not your problem. You can't put your life on hold for him. Let him stay home and give him some factual reading material on the lack of asymptomatic spread and ineffectiveness of mask wearing. Will this cause a rift? Maybe. But it's not really your problem what he feels about it. I was in a similar situation but just went about my life and shared some facts with him, and now he's on the same page as me. Made some friends along the way that share my views too.</p>
