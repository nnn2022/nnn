    <strong>How did all of this happen so fast?</strong>
    <p><p>When I hear my family talking or when I'm taking a walk and in my job as well I feel like in a dystopian movie or something. </p>
<p>In 2019 and before we had no fear to stay close to a person, to hug, to kiss, to hook-up and meet friends. We could enter a shop quickly and mind your own business. You could recognize someone on the streets and start a conversation with them there. We could breathe fresh air and not be scared of anything and anyone.</p>
<p>Now it's mind-blowing how everything morphed into a scary fear- mongering situation. If people dare to live their lives, they're meet with scrutiny and ridicule. If you dare celebrate your birthday or meet some friends, well you're killing grandma and you're a right-wing nazi that should be tortured. Yes, I live in Brazil and I heard that once. </p>
<p>Now to enter a shop or any closed place you have to put on a mask, wash your hands and maybe have your temperature measured. </p>
<p>If you post a selfie on the beach, someone is definitely gonna reply, where's your mask? Stay at home! </p>
<p>Suddenly we're not allowed to live anymore and the worst is that people are okay with this! </p>
<p>My grandparents put on a mask everytime they step outside their home just to see the neighborhood. Like, they're still close to the door, no one's around, but they put on a mask. My mom, she uses that all day, at home and at work. </p>
<p>I mean, I'm lucky to live in a city where the mayor refuses to close the city and not everyone agrees. I love when I'm taking a walk and I see maskless people and sometimes we even greet each other. I went to the beach February and I was happy to see the place crowded and no one wearing a mask, just having a good time. </p>
<p>But I wish I could see more. I wish there wasn't so many people blinded by all of this. I personally know people who haven't left home since last year!</p>
<p>I'm a loner, I don't have friends beside coworkers but I'm happy to go out, buy books and hook-up. I enjoy breathing fresh air and not feel like I'm doing something wrong and that at any moment the police is gonna come and fine me because I dare show my face.</p>
<p>How did we let this happen so quick? How everyone became so afraid of each other so fucking quickly? How did we change our behavior in such a drastic way?</p>
<p>I'm only 21 but I'm afraid how life is gonna be ahead of us. </p>
<p>Sorry if this is too long, I just wanted to put my thoughts out there because this is the only place I can share that.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. I don't recognize the world we live in anymore. It's not just the masks. It started with that. Now there's racial divided and mass shootings and election fraud on some level no matter what side you're on. I worry about the generations that come after as well. Less than 2 years and this is where we are. Not only as separate countries but as the world at large.</p>

        <p>It's easier and easier to just look around and become more and more of a nihilist of some sort. Like, there's no point trying to tell people something is wrong. I feel like deep down they know or at least feel something is wrong but they refuse to be uncomfortable and question what's happening. Everything is being made to divide us in every way possible so that we are easily manipulated. We are seeing the results right now.</p>

        <p>They know. The sad part is I think most of us do too. But at the point of survival what are you willing to sacrifice for your next breath, paycheck, dinner, etc. At some point the powers that be will learn that the most frightening thing on this planet is a SURVIVOR. What we loose to get to that point....</p>

        <p>It feels like it was fast but it was actually decades in the making. IMO social media was what allowed them to accelerate it. 
Also I firmly believe there’s something not quite ‘human’ involved. Alchemy, spells, whatnot. There just isn’t any rational explanation how they got the whole world into masks in six weeks.  And now the real weapon of course.</p>

        <p>I’m in Florida right now, you really wouldn’t know anything was going on if you didn’t tap into the news other than the occasional person wearing a mask. You would probably just think they were weird. I am visiting from a crazy restrictive place, but even I had to consciously tell myself to unlearn some of what I’ve been made to do to work and live life. People really are going to have to deprogram themselves if life will return to normal. And I think the more fanatical a person is the harder it will be for that person.  I don’t know how I’m going to go back and not be angry all the time.</p>

        <p>Spot on. But most people want safety, they hate being uncomfortable so they will do anything the government tells them to feel a false sense of security. And yes, sometimes I'm scared to go out maskless because I fear someone is gonna come and I have to consciously calm myself and say that I'm living my life, that's not a crime. But I think that those more fanatical are simply lost, they learned to see those who are different as the enemy.</p>

        <p>Most people are weak and don't want to lose their comfort. A vast majority of people have never had to face any real confrontation, nor have they had to really call out lies and manipulation of this scale. They don't want to face backlash or ostracization, especially when that backlash can be amplified by social media, so they just keep convincing themselves its not that bad. As long as they have their homes, go to work, watch TV, etc. A lot of the boomer generation grew up unquestionably trusting authority, whether that's government or "science".</p>
<p>Also, with how much the government and media has intruded into families and divided them, people are scared their own parents or kids will criticize them or try and ruin their lives for not being obedient. This is extremely bad for parents whose university "educated" kids still live with them.</p>

        <p>24/7 propaganda.  It doesn’t even have to be the news media anymore.  Just plant a bunch of seeds on social media about how this is the scariest virus ever and watch it bloom.  It doesn’t hurt to encourage people to post mask selfies so that they can maximize their likes.</p>
<p>For most of this I haven’t been convinced that this was planned out, but it’s getting harder to not believe it with everyday.  I’ve been noticing the following things:</p>
<p>For the last 10 or so years there’s been a big push (especially on the internet) against anti vaxxers.</p>
<p>The internet started worshipping scientists and experts like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Carl Sagan.  </p>
<p>“Going with your gut” gets ridiculed in favor of logic and reason, and it seemed like everybody started coming out as an atheist at the same time and replacing religion with science.  It became trendy.</p>
<p>Basically, it seems pretty convenient that we’ve been flooded with this kind of stuff for 10 years or so and then this happens, and we’re constantly told to “trust the experts”, “follow the science” and “take the jab”.</p>

        <p>I agree it happened just when technology/infrastructure was prevalent enough to make that happen, with Amazon deliveries, curbside pickup etc. </p>
<p>I also think 2020 must be the first time in history when a critical mass of people have been able to feel “alone in the mass” while they are actually at home, also thanks to technology. This is identified as the state in which people are most easily influenced by propaganda.</p>

        <p>Stupid but most notably and more horribly the lazy. Those pathetically lazy people that had a meltdown when all this shit started. We had the information at the beginning but their fear, intellectual laziness,  conformity and most importantly their lack of courage then and still has fucked everyone. </p>
<p>The only good thing that came out of all this is those people that would laugh at “conspiracy theorists” now see with the loudest most obviously idiotic example in history, how ridiculous it seems when someone calls you a conspiracy theorist. God forbid You think it’s a good idea to ask questions before busting out the knee pads and start slobbing knobs while thanking them for the opportunity to do so. </p>
<p>For those of you that are astonished as to why you didn’t see this bullshit before take that same tbhiught process and think about all the other conspiracy theories you discarded as stupid in the passed. Many of them aren’t so stupid and they’re almost as obvious as covid. </p>
<p>Most of the time, like with covid, the information was never really hidden because they don’t have to waste their time doing so. Often you’ll see important people to the story randomly die and you’ll think oh shot that’s unfortunate. What a coincidence. Until you realize that that type of shit happens all the time. </p>
<p>Someone literally, per the police report, committed suicide by themselves in the back of the head, twice. It was not an automatic weapon. Shit it might have been something as stupid as a 45 revolver. Fucking forget who this was, will have to check but they just so happened to have crucial information in to help out away some piece of shit that’s still walking around. </p>
<p>I call these random deaths being Clinton’d. </p>
<p>Fuck another stupid obvious shenanigans infested fuckfest with the last recession. </p>
<p>Also include literally Every single time the government instituted that emergency funding thing for a vaccine. </p>
<p>9/11 isn’t as cut and dry as you think it is. In fact it’s so unbelievably fucked you’ll scratch your head wondering why no one talked about it at the time. They did, just no one gave a fuck like always. </p>
<p>Take This approach to literally to everything that seems even a little fucky and you’ll be even more surprised just how colossal the mountain of suspiciously fucked up events really is and just how easily we ignored them and moved on. It’s insanity. </p>
<p>I rant because I’m hoping at least one of you will start asking a few more questions.</p>

<p>I suggest blocking anyone on facebook or instagram that gives you grief, and just live your life like you always did. The CDC says you just moved out of the 99.998% survival age range and into the 99.95% age range (For everyone under 50...)</p>
