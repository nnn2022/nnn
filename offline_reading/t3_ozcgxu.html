        <p>NAC is good if you’re able to buy it online. It had great support as a Covid treatment before FDA decided to ban its production conveniently.</p>

        <p>Wash your hands and don't pick your nose lol... Covid was a mild cold for me. No treatment. If my job didn't require testing I wouldnt have even suspected COVID. I'm probably twice your age and overweight. There's almost no risk from COVID for a healthy highschool teen. You're life and health is at more risk traveling to and from school. Take your vitamins, eat well, exercise, limit stress and don't worry about it. If your parents are worried I'm afraid there's nothing you can do to ease that.</p>
