        <p>They're intubated due to bacteria pneumonia and sepsis, not Covid.  I'd say something, but I'm probably banned there too.  Doesn't matter that I have professional knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>This "nurse" is making an emotional plea.  That's how you manipulate people.  Deflect their facts with the "horror" of the Covid ICU.  Truth is the ICUs were less busy than previous respiratory seasons.  Hospitals laid off nurses ffs.</p>
<p>In my wife's hoslital all the patients on the Covid unit are there for other reasons.  Covid is an incidental finding.</p>
<p>In short, NEVER EVER believe an argument based on emotional pleas.  The person is only trying to garner sympathy, get followers or manipulate you.</p>

        <p>My aunt is a nurse that worked in a covid ward for a bit. She said there were "healthy people" that were getting taken out by this virus. I pulled the thread a bit and it turns out what the health care system considers a healthy person is horrendously skewed. If you can walk up a single flight of stairs you are basically a healthy person according to her definition.</p>
<p>So as someone who runs ultramarathons and eats a diet almost exclusively of meat and vegetables... I need to fear covid... which I already had... ok aunt "F"</p>

        <p>This has been going on all along.  The media uses terms the public believes means one thing, but they actually mean something else.</p>
<p>"Healthy" can mean no medical history.  Well, if somone never visits a doctor, then they have no medical history.  Doesn't mean they have no health conditions.</p>
<p>Or, a headline the says "75 infected in super spreader event, 15 die".  Most people believe 15 died of Covid, but it turns out they died in car crashes or cancer or something else.  Yet, nothing in that headline is technically untrue.  That's how the public has been fooled.</p>

        <p>Honestly i think a lot are slaves to their jobs, either because they need to pay off student loans or they need the salary to support their lifestyle. It’s been Made clear that any doctor that goes against the narrative will be ostracized, discredited, and have their accomplishment’s erased, so in fear, no one speaks out.</p>
<p>Writing that out made me realize it reminds me exactly of a scene in hbo’s Chernobyl where the head scientist is threatened with that exact punishment by a kgb agent if he goes against the official narrative. We are a lot closer to totalitarianism and 1984 style ministry of truth that it might seem.</p>

        <p>That was exactly my thought. I mean I would be horrified but I imagine you have seen people die all the time and the kind of scene you describe is just part of a normal day in ICU. I know I went there once with my husbands grandma and saw someone pass away during the first 20 min there.</p>

        <p>But was it bacterial pneumonia caused by a bacteria or viral pneumonia caused by COVID? Or they may have coexisted in some patients? And at first when they were basically intubating everyone and people were dying because of it, maybe it was true that there were more deaths than usual? I do know many hospitals in general were much, much less busy but don't know about ICUs specifically. That's the problem. You can't trust anything. Not the media, not the internet. Everyone lies. The only people I trust are my closest friends and family. That's why I feel we will never know the actual truth.
That's interesting about COVID being an incidental finding. I'm sure that was true for quite a few people. So.. nurses saying they were experiencing more death than ever before are exaggerating for sympathy/likes? I guess I just don't understand that mindset. I agree that an argument based on emotional pleas is not sound or as believable as one that is not. I would love to see true numbers. Not CDC numbers. The facts. But like I said, we will probably never know. Thanks for your reply!</p>

<p>Remember we only heard from a small, vocal minority.  Anyone that went against the narrative got censored.  Those who supported it got rewarded.  If you’re trying to be internet famous and get your Go Fund Me up and running, supporting the narrative and telling sob stories was the way to go.</p>
<p>&rt;But was it bacterial pneumonia caused by a bacteria or viral pneumonia caused by COVID?</p>
<p>It's secondary bacterial pneumonia, just like happens with the flu.  Covid pneumonia has its own ICD code.  The one for bacterial pneumonia was used.  Fauci was urged to recommend vaccination for pneumococcal pneumonia early in 2020.  He repiled to those emails that they should but made no public announcement.</p>

<p>Coulda sworn the narrative about masks last year was that they protect <em>other</em> people, not yourself, which is why everyone had to wear one. Funny how the maskers shift to whatever is most convenient to feel virtuous.</p>

        <p>Around the beginning of the pandemic at least in America, some people didn't want to wear masks as "it won't protect against COVID" or "it restricts oxygen flow". Both of these can't be true as in size COVID particles is around 100 nanometers while CO2 for example is around 0.33 nm in diameter. So if oxygen (inhale)/CO2 (exhale) can't go through a mask, how come COVID can?</p>

        <p>Exactly. They flip flop as much as Fraudci does! Now the maskers are wearing their masks because the unvaccinated are a danger &amp; COVID has shown them how dirty other people really are. In a way their mask came off. Now they no longer hide their true feelings. It was never about anyone else, they never cared about anyone but themselves.</p>

        <p>weird to you perhaps, but some people feel very lonely and not accepted, or insecure....this drive goes back from the whole history of being mammals in a social species. Thousands of years,  not being accepted, meant being ousted and left to fend for one self, which usually meant quick death. The acceptance of likes ties to chemical rewards, that are the same as any form of receiving acceptance and praise. This is ingrained in our DNA. The question is, did we design social media the way we did BECAUSE of this need, or did we just happen to tap on it strongly - probably the former.</p>

        <p>Part of the challenge with the issue is that it has been so politically weaponized that anyone who dares to discuss instances outside the "approved" narrative are subject to attacks, and censorship if they use social media.</p>
<p>There will invariably be elements of truth to each case but because of these "uncertain", and "unprecedented" times (as far as restricting discourse) the only acceptable narrative must feature COVID as the central character in each case.</p>

        <p>Stories like this are true. COVID definitely fucks up a lot of people. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean that masks work. It doesn't mean that lockdowns work. It doesn't mean that vaccines will end the pandemic. It's still a relatively small percentage of the population who end up in the hospital gasping for air. But it is a real virus that does mess people up good. People who work in hospitals are often exposed to higher viral loads when they get infected, so they often have more severe cases than someone who might have picked up a milder infection at a grocery store or something.</p>

        <p>I know a lot of people in medicine, here in Los Angeles. These stories are consistent here - from people who work all over the place, every hospital. I have heard things directly from at least 5 different doctors working in 5 different places, never mind tons of different people in other related jobs - that are this story, and a whole lot more. Most people in medicine, never dealt with something like this in their careers and a lot are leaving medicine, becasue of it. Someone commenting here may live in a city that didnt get hit very hard, or was a lot more isolated from travelers. To put blanket statements across the  country of how every medical facility is, is ridiculous, either side of what you feel about this. Many hospitals around here were having to use meeting rooms and other rooms, even still into this year, to deal with the amount of patients needing ventilators. People watched their loved ones die in their yards of heart attacks and other things, because there were not enough ambulances to deal with them. </p>
<p>For those commenting below, death is not always "known", and most dont do autopsies anymore. So a lot of causes of death are best guesses, based on the evidence presented. A great many where my partner works, died early on, probably from Covid, but were never labeled as such. These were people (elderly) already sick and struggling, but their deaths still didnt make sense to those treating them. In hindsight, they think it was probably covid. So for all those saying "people are just labeling deaths covid when they arent", there are also a lot of deaths being labeled other things when they probably were covid.</p>
<p>Source - doctors I know. Take it for what it is, but I watched and communicated closely with these people through this whole pandemic here in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In hindsight <em>everyone</em> thinks they had covid.</p>
<p>I cant count the number of people who now say they had covid if they had any kind of flu- or cold- experiences since summer 2019.</p>

<p>Someone is conducting medical malpractice. Also, why won't you ask the government to send you more funds, so that you have more equipment and personnel, so that you aren't as exhausted as you say you are?</p>

        <p>You know it's hard to say.  I don't doubt that there are people who are traumatized.  I'm sure there are nurses that are traumatized.  There are also nurses who should probably consider transferring from ICU work to maybe a podiatrist's office. </p>
<p>A nursing degree doesn't prove any particular level of basic or social intelligence.   So it's totally possible.   Then again, this being reddit, it could be a 13 year old boy.</p>

        <p>&rt;Do you know what it’s like looking in their eyes as they know they’re dying? </p>
<p>The thing about this stuff is that a nurse in ICU does this all the time.  This is "normal", dealing with people in terrible situations and in great pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>After a while you just kind of get used to stuff like that, and it becomes "a normal day at work".</p>
<p>So these kinds of stories are always a bit odd to me.</p>
<p>Should we feel worse about a covid victim than a 13yr old kid who comes in dying from an overdose, or a 23yr old with half of his throat blown out from a gunfight?  Should a nurse?</p>
<p>Nurses deal with deal all the time. They deal with dying people all the time. Much "worse" deaths than Covid deaths.</p>
<p>Why are <em>these</em> ones suddenly so special?</p>
<p>It's just all a bit forced.</p>
