    <strong>Unvaccinated vs fully vaccinated death numbers are proof of failure even if adjusted for the vaccine blocking infection (reposted after immediate removal for lack of flair)...</strong>
    <p><p>These numbers have been pulled from <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/07/03/fully-vaccinated-people-have-a-885-higher-chance-of-death-due-to-covid-19-than-people-who-are-unvaccinated-according-to-official-data/">the following article</a>, which is in turn <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/997418/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_17.pdf">sourced from a British study</a>. Those numbers were then Extrapolated for the "per 100,000" figure.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated</p>
<ul>
<li>44 deaths from 53,822 infected (ratio 81.75 per 100,000 infections)</li>
<li>44 deaths from 831 hospitalizations (ratio 5,294.83 per 100,000 hospitalizations)</li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccinated (2 doses)</p>
<ul>
<li>50 deaths from 7,235 infected (ratio 691.09 per 100,000 infections)</li>
<li>50 deaths from 190 hospitalizations (ratio 26,315.79 per 100,000 hospitalizations)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a rate of 8.45x more likely to die from infection and 4.97x more more likely to die if hospitalized. Now, overall death risk from covid is insignificant as vaccinated or unvaccinated was still less than 1% of infections resulting in deaths (rates 0.08% unvaccinated, 0.69% vaccinated 2 doses) based on the numbers from the sample studied. However, the vaccine makes you significantly more likely to die from infection if you are infected, and that much is undeniable.</p>
<p>Even if we assume the vaccine is 60% effective against the delta variant which just HYPOTHETICALLY changes the death rate to 0.08% unvaccinated, and 0.28% vaccinated 2 doses if the vaccine actually blocked infections (still 3.5x greater than unvaccinated). However, the vaccine neither prevents infections, nor transmission. Rather, the vaccine only lessens symptoms while adding symptom-like side effects. Therefore, I stand by the initial numbers.</p>
<p>To put these numbers in comparison...</p>
<ul>
<li>General US deaths in 28 days: 62.90 per 100,000 population</li>
<li>Unvaccinated infection deaths in 28 days: 81.75 per 100,000 infected population</li>
<li>Fully vaccinated infection deaths in 28 days: 691.09 per 100,000 infected population</li>
<li>Fully vaccinated (with 60% assumed infection prevention) deaths in 28 days: 276.44 per 100,000 otherwise infected population</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, this is slightly skewed as some of the normal deaths we see occur within covid, such as people dying of heart failure with covid who might have otherwise died of just heart failure. Still, it's safe to assume that fully infecting a completely unvaccinated population nationwide would roughly double annual deaths, while doing so to a fully vaccinated population would increase annual deaths to over twelve times their normal number (or increase annual deaths more than five times their general number assuming a 60% level of infection blocking effectiveness).</p></p>

<p>TPTB has always been honest about 'flattening the curve.' We just assumed that it meant C19 hospitalisations and deaths. They meant freedoms, economy, employment, supply chains and population.</p>

        <p>Haha holy fuck you unironically believe that the covid vaccine will cause a new world order. This is golden. Nah man, if you’re right that it’s a conspiracy, then the conspiracy would be that the vaccine gives you immunity to a gas/chemical they’re going to drop over the world, killing off all those who disobeyed them.

        <p>No you wouldn’t. If the government is going to do anything regarding the vax, they’re going to make it to where they kill the anti-vaxxers off. You’re a conspiracy nut job, but if you want to believe in a conspiracy that is the most likely one. They wouldn’t want to give a deadly vaccine to people that obey them. They’d want to kill the disobedient people. So like I said, if you’re right, it’s you guys who will die, not us :)</p>

        <p>All you need to do is to look at VAERS and the zillions of Go Fund Mes launched to vaxx deaths.

<p>Hahahhahaha. I am fully vaxxed. And I’m all for open discussion around it. I acknowledge some people can get blood clots, although it’s incredibly rare. I’ve yet to see any research showing that the vaccine is more dangerous than Covid though. And I doubt you have either. </p>
<p>And I’m not even a liberal lmao. Just don’t like being associated with extremists who think the government is trying to murder them and think this is all a hoax. What benefit would the world have by shutting down the economy and fucking themselves over. If covid on its own and also covid vaccines are a hoax, then it was the most elaborate, effective, and most backfiring hoax of all time. You essentially have to hold the belief that the government wants people dead if you’re calling covid an inside job. Which means you actually think every country got together, despite how much they hated each other, and agreed “let’s all kill off a large chunk of the population with a vaccine!” Just LOL. </p>
<p>Got the vaccine months ago. I feel great. When does the death start to kick in?</p>

        <p>Not surprising... This is British, so different agencies, but probably still the same policy. The plan all along has been for them to hide the vaccine deaths under the delta variant and then use that to force more vaccines. Please link to the CDC info if you get a chance so that so I can post to the wider community, or do so yourself if you prefer. Either way, it's definitely something people need to know.</p>

        <p>Not surprising. However, as I mentioned in another comment on adjusting the levels to allow for more infected or would-have-been-infected</p>
<p>&rt;... even if we assume that all infection rates are directly tied to the vaccine and any difference are people who were not infected for the vaccine, adding a number of uninfected people presumed saved to adjust for the roughly 7.4x as many unvaccinated infected still yields a net increase in deaths resulting in 113.59% rate of deaths from infection for vaccinated compared to those unvaccinated after accounting for the presumed protected missing. Not as bad, but still worse than no vaccine and the opposite of protection.</p>
<p>However, that assumption is a pretty big one. Regardless, even if it's only slightly less than useless, there's still the associated risk and side effects, plus unknown long-term issues we're still finding out about, so this still begs the question of what was the point...</p>

        <p>The death rate isn’t lower in unvaccinated vs vaccinated individuals at all. They’re actually the same according to the stats that OP provided for U.K. if you actually consider how many are vaccinated and how many aren’t (though the numbers are too low to infer significance).</p>
<p>Confirmed cases and hospitalisations, however, are much lower in vaccinated individuals, which suggests that the vaccine is effective.</p>

        <p>Hmmm. Wonder why. Maybe because the people who got vaccinated and hospitalized got vaccinated because they were at significant risk? And the people unvaccinated didn’t get vaccinated because they were at very low risk? So when the vaccinated people DID get it, they were more likely to get very ill even though they had a vaccine. It just means those dead post vaccine would’ve died anyways.</p>

        <p>There is no reason to use confirmed cases as your sample when you have accurate numbers on vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals. You cannot say “this many people who contracted COVID with the vaccine were hospitalized vs this many who contracted COVID without he vaccine were hospitalized, therefore the vaccine isn’t effective” without actually looking at how many of the whole population are actually vaccinated/not vaccinated, and I’ll demonstrate why by repeating the analysis. Remember that those who have already received 2 doses are going to be older and more likely to have comorbidities that make them vulnerable to serious illness because they’re prioritised. I’ll break it down for you now:</p>
<p>25M people have received 2 doses of the vaccine, 21M people have received 0 doses of the vaccine.</p>
<p>As per this table:</p>
<ul>
<li>53,822 unvaccinated Delta cases (0.256%)</li>
<li>7,235 fully vaccinated Delta cases (0.0289%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Without assessing p-values, we’ll say that roughly 10x increased risk of contracting the Delta variant if unvaccinated.</p>
<ul>
<li>831 unvaccinated Delta hospitalisations (0.00396%)</li>
<li>190 fully vaccinated Delta hospitalisations (0.00076%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Without assessing p-values, we’ll say that roughly 5x increased risk of hospitalization with Delta variant if unvaccinated</p>
<ul>
<li>44 unvaccinated Delta deaths (0.00021%)</li>
<li>50 fully vaccinated Delta deaths (0.0002%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Without assessing p-values, no difference in deaths rates with Delta if unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Do you understand this? If I just say “0.07% cases in unvaccinated died vs 0.69% cases in vaccinated died” without actually considering that the chance of contracting the disease in the first place is far lower if you’re vaccinated then you cannot say “the vaccine therefore increases your risk of dying from COVID”. That is flawed.</p>
<p>If you don’t understand, feel free to ask questions. I’m sure that your intentions are to actually understand the data, which is easily misrepresented, so I’m willing to take more time to explain it to you. Also do remember that there are a plethora of other compounding factors that make this “face-value” analysis (including my own) completely flawed because the two populations that we’re comparing are very different. Recognize that unvaccinated are far more likely to be younger and healthier, yet the rate of hospital admissions in this population is still 5x higher.</p>

        <p>There is a reason... BECAUSE THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO MEASURE, AND IT IS THE SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENT THE STUDY USED!!! Unless we're going to be given access to the raw data, using "science" built on assumed numbers won't work. You can't say "200 people died in a sample of country x, and country x has 50 million people, so therefore" because it is apples and oranges, a sample of a thing compared to the actual thing.</p>

        <p>Which part of what I wrote do you disagree with? Where is the flaw in the stats that I used? I’ve explained why the “study” you linked is flawed. The numbers of vaccinated individuals in the U.K. is accurate because it’s tracked. I’m not just guessing. And no, my comparison isn’t apples to oranges - it’s a direct calculation of risk of hospitalisation due to COVID in those who are vaccinated vs those who aren’t. This is like banging my head against a brick wall…</p>

        <p>The parts I mentioned. Apples and oranges. We wanted a measure of dangers to infected individuals of being vaxxed, so that's what we measured. If I want to measure the distance from the washing machine to the door, I don't need to hear about how that's wrong because you wanted to measure the distance to the fridge. That's just muddying the waters. Your 25M who got the shot? That's not the sample. It's not what's being studied, nor what we are studying at the moment. You want to talk about how many people didn't get infected? Fine... But that's a different topic, not a rebuttal. Your entire methodology is flawed because it's built on an unsound premise even before we start to look at the fact that the vaccine doesn't prevent infection.</p>
<p>Now, I've addressed other people in other comments about the allegedly protected people who took the vaxx, and I'll tell you what I told them:</p>
<p>&rt;... even if we assume that all infection rates are directly tied to the vaccine and any difference are people who were not infected for the vaccine, adding a number of uninfected people presumed saved to adjust for the roughly 7.4x as many unvaccinated infected still yields a net increase in deaths resulting in 113.59% rate of deaths from infection for vaccinated compared to those unvaccinated after accounting for the presumed protected missing. Not as bad, but still worse than no vaccine and the opposite of protection.</p>

        <p>Your quote makes absolutely no sense. Care to share your working because I can’t make head nor tail of it.</p>
<p>You can cherry-pick specific samples, let’s roll with that for a minute. Admittedly, I didn’t realise that this was what you were doing because it makes absolutely no sense but at least I can now see how you got to the wrong conclusion. So let’s summarise: vaccination greatly reduces infection and hospitalisation rates. The ~0.03% who are vaccinated and do get infected have a higher risk of hospitalisation/death according to your stats, even though the overall hospitalisation/death rates in vaccinated individuals are far lower. So what’s the conclusion and explanation? Could it be that those who contract disease despite vaccination were already at risk of more severe disease? Or that the vaccine itself makes you more susceptible to serious disease if you do contract it? Or, just maybe, could it be that vaccinated individuals are older and have more comorbidities and you are therefore, as you put it, comparing apples to oranges?</p>
<p>I’m wondering what your response is to the fact that your own data shows that vaccination protects against  both infection and hospitalisation, contrary to what you’ve erroneously written. </p>
<p>Finally, how is exactly is my methodology flawed? I’m using the numbers that you posted. Highlight where I’m wrong.</p>

<p>Measuring a specific thing isn't cherry picking. If I want to know how much gas a gas tank holds, and you say "no no no you're not accounting wiper fluid and oil and other fluids", it's not cherry picking to say that's not what we are measuring. IT'S JUST NOT WHAT WE'RE MEASURING!!! Cherry picking would be only measuring gas tanks that are half full, or have more than 5 gallons. You want to talk about general population infection rates on a post referring to studies about the infected rate of death in a sample. That's like going on about literacy rates in New York because I did a survey about how many people in Brooklyn read The Old Man and the Sea. IT'S NOT RELATED. Frankly, infection rates are subject to too many individual variables of lifestyle. Are vaxxed more secure because they have treatment and therefore going out to clubs? Are they naturally more paranoid about illness and therefore self-isolating? This one variable scale throws the whole deal off because behavior modifies infectability. Exposure is THE vector of transmission.</p>
<p>&rt;I’m wondering what your response is to the fact that your own data shows that vaccination protects against both infection and hospitalization, contrary to what you’ve erroneously written.</p>
<p>It doesn't. That's just more based science based on assumptions. They don't show that the vaxx protected against transmission. They show that the sample size of vaccinated is smaller. Again, that's not the same thing. There are too many other variables at play such as geography, initial locations of exposure, population density of demographics measured and behavioral patterns that would need to be considered, but are not considered in this study. If you took vaccinated people and unvaccinated people in similar samples and exposed both via the same means of transmission for the same time, THAT would be usable to measure immunity levels between vaxxed and unvaxxed.

        <p>The whole thing makes no sense. What the hell does “adding a number of infected people presumed saved to adjust for the roughly 7.4x as many unvaccinated infected…” mean?</p>
<p>If you’re saying that lack of control makes my analysis unsound then the EXACT same thing holds for the analysis that you linked, and it’s going to be compounded by the fact that they’ve further reduced the sample size. Are you actually not able to see that or are you just being facetious at this point?</p>
<p>“They show that the sample size of vaccinated is smaller”. Again, what does this mean? The U.K. to date has 34.2M people fully vaccinated, ~46M with at least one dose. As I’ve repeated multiple times, at the time of your study there were ~25M fully vaccinated and ~21M unvaccinated. According to the stats in the “study” that you posted, there were 53822 cases in unvaccinated (0.26%) and 7235 in fully vaccinated (0.0029%). How does this NOT infer protection if vaccinated? With a sample size of over 20M per group, the data is going to be as normal as can be, and certainly more normal than of you only look at confirmed cases (~60k). But again, if the data really is that skewed then the conclusions given in your post are equally as erroneous. So which is it? Are we both completely wrong or does the vaccine protect against infection?</p>
<p>It’s incredibly frustrating repeating the same thing over and over to somebody who simply doesn’t understand what they’re saying but I hope that you can at least appreciate my patience.</p>

        <p>Exactly what it said: If the numbers would have otherwise been equal, just as an illustrative tool, and people would have been infected or not in the same numbers, it STILL wouldn't justify the vaccine.</p>
<p>Lack of control is not an issue in what's being studied, but the study didn't control for things it wasn't studying. Why would it, after all...</p>
<p>It means that the sample size of the vaccinated was smaller. It's not rocket science... I figure you understand from context alone I'm talking about the number of people, not midgets.</p>
<p>If it's frustrating repeating the same things over and over, QUIT DOING IT!!! That's not how information is spread nor conversations are held... and it's not going to convince anyone to keep saying obviously wrong things over and over.</p>

        <p>&rt; The ~0.03% who are vaccinated and do get infected have a higher risk of hospitalisation/death according to your stats, even though the overall hospitalisation/death rates in vaccinated individuals are far lower. So what’s the conclusion and explanation? Could it be that those who contract disease despite vaccination were already at risk of more severe disease? Or that the vaccine itself makes you more susceptible to serious disease if you do contract it?</p>
<p>Okay, I see the problem that OP is getting at, but you passed over (This is not meant to be a dig at either of you).  </p>
<p>From another post, it seems there is roughly a 50/50 split between vax and non vax.</p>
<p>We see a significant drop in cases and hospitalizations. </p>
<p>However, the number of deaths is the same.</p>
<p>I'd argue that the vaccine is reducing the number of cases/hospitalizations for the healthy or those that have marginal health, but the unhealthiest are still at risk regardless of vaccination.</p>

        <p>I’d draw exactly the same conclusion and this is supported when you look at age distribution of deaths. Tiny numbers so it’s never going to be accurate but only 2 deaths in vaccinated (one dose, none in 2-dose group) were &lt;50yrs vs 6 in unvaccinated. Also, a pedantic point but absolute number of deaths have fallen rapidly since vaccination was introduced.</p>

        <p>I actually understand what you're saying and think you are correct but it is nonetheless interesting that while your chances of being a "case" when unvaccinated are much higher (most cases are asymptomatic) your chances of dying are roughly equal according to your analysis.   </p>
<p>This basically suggests that vaccines at BEST slightly reduce your chance of non-fatal hospitalization.</p>

        <p>It is interesting. I wouldn’t be surprised if deaths were in immunosuppressive individuals for whom the vaccine isn’t going to have much of an effect. It would be interesting to look at deaths on a case-by-case basis. There are likely other compounding factors. The numbers are also too small to offer significance, so while one definitely can’t say from these stats that it reduces risk of death, one also can’t say that it doesn’t. I will say that I think the reduction in infection and hospitalisation rates are substantial, though.</p>

        <p>The evidence large says otherwise. The information coming forward now suggest that many of the vaccine deaths involve the immune system becoming confused and attacking the body, and the spike protein from the virus may further trigger this.</p>

        <p>I’d love to see this information. Considering that only 2 of the deaths in vaccinated individuals were &lt;50, and neither of these were fully vaccinated, it seems far more likely a result of demographic differences. Obviously conjecture and I’d review my position if I was shown evidence to suggest that it’s a result of “confused” immune system and resulting autoimmunity.</p>

        <p>&rt;  The numbers of vaccinated individuals in the U.K. is accurate because it’s tracked. </p>
<p>I'd like to make two points, at least for the US.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html">As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like the CDC is no longer monitoring breakthrough case numbers as thoroughly as before.</p>
<p>I could be completely wrong in my interpretations.</p>
<ul>
<li>My employer (Community College) has received guidance from the state that we are not required to test vaccinated students/faculty/staff starting this fall.  </li>
</ul>
<p>We were a major source of data locally, as we conducted over 25,000 tests between September 2020 and May 2021, regardless of vaccination status.  Again, I could see this under counting the actual number of cases out there.</p>
<p>If we aren't reporting all breakthrough cases or even testing vaccinated people, I don't think we can say that you're 7x more likely to get COVID.</p>
