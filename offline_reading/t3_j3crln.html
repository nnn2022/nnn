    <strong>From The "Hello Captain Obvious" Files - In This Scam-Demic, PC Matters More Than Human Lives, Our Economy, Or Our Personal Freedoms!</strong>
    <p><p>When the Shanghai Shivers first became a thing, we had a small window of opportunity to control its spread here. At that point, when the population was on board and infection numbers were small, a halt to incoming flights from China, land border closures, and a two-to-three-week (no extension allowed) targeted lockdown might have nipped this thing in the bud.</p>
<p>But kissing China's ass was more important.</p>
<p>Mind you, from the behaviour of our politicians and "health care experts" in the early stages of this Scam-Demic, I honestly believe <em>they wanted it to spread.</em></p>
<p>This glorified flu virus has given governments unlimited powers - and they have discovered they like it.</p>
<p>This toothpaste ain't going back in the tube easily...</p>
