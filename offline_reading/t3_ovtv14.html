    <strong>Anybody have a list of sources showing fully vaccinated people catching covid or ending up sick in the hospital from it?</strong>
    <p><p>I keep hearing about breakthrough cases and how ineffective the vaccines have been in the real world as opposed to the lab setting. </p>
<p>If anybody has a doc or just a list of links they could share I would appreciate it. Having a comprehensive list of evidence is important.</p></p>

        <p>The White House has refused several times to release numbers on breakthrough cases and their respective origin.  One can only presume because it would counter the narrative that only people that haven't gotten the shot are suffering.</p>
<p>And stop referring to them as vaccinated.  It's not a vaccine.</p>

        <p>yes - try the original application studies submitted to the fda / ema</p>
<p>pfzier, moderna, J&amp;J etc</p>
<p>those were "real world" studies. They all showed jabbed people catch covid.</p>

        <p>Yep, this isn't even news. Those of us who were paying attention knew this from the beginning. I buy that mainstream media didn't know because they are ignorant. Did the CDC not know, or were they just biding time with the information and pretending they didn't know?</p>

        <p>What surprises me more is how many members of this sub are acting surprised.</p>
<p>Remember when the absolute risk reduction vs relative risk reduction controversy broke? this covid vaccine not working perfectly data was widely shared.</p>

        <p>Taken from a page talking about the Pfizer treatment</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"It gets even worse. One of the criteria of a ‘case’ in the trials was <br>
that it should be contracted not earlier than seven days after the <br>
second jab. That helped keep the number down enormously – to only eight –<br>
 in the vaccinated group. This is because so many vaccine recipients <br>
have Covid-like symptoms in the first few days after the jab. </p>
<p>A subsequent analysis, hidden away in a report by the US Food and <br>
Drug Administration, found that when Covid-like symptoms reported in <br>
those first few days were included, there were 407 cases among the <br>
vaccinated compared with only 287 in the placebo group, an entirely <br>
different risk-benefit picture and one consistent with many studies <br>
showing an increase in death rates among the elderly immediately after <br>
the jab. "</p>

        <p>Many countries are removing "priveliges" that go with being vaccinated for cofid-19. If you websearch any Nation and their Department of Health guidelines, you should have a lot.</p>
