        <p>I was wondering if anyone on this sub was going to acknowledge what’s happening there. People dying on the street in front of hospitals,  hospitals running out of basic supplies, trucks carrying oxygen tanks escorted by armed guard because of desperate thefts going on, totally overwhelmed hospitals means many more cases and deaths going uncounted.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty fake, they’re probs making this all up to “fear monger.” AKA this is not really happening, I deny that this is real. Etc etc etc</p>

        <p>Have you got any evidence of this? I know hospitals in the UK aren't overwhelmed, I've never seen armed guards protecting oxygen from them pesky oxygen thieves, hospitals always run out of supplies so this isn't because of covid, I have seen many Freedom of Information requests sent to major hospitals and many are returning with very few or no deaths. That you can't argue with. I'm not saying there's no virus but what I'm saying is the main stream media are totally exaggerating the entire thing. They are the ones fear mongering. Check the CDC website for precise death figures and you will be shocked.</p>

        <p>Of course I did but this article doesn't tell me much. I read a report about a hospital in the UK being overwhelmed and patients had to wait for beds. Turned out that the covid unit had four beds. More cases doesn't actually mean more covid cases, it merely means they have tested positive for a virus, which could have laid dormant in their body for decades. The PCR test is pointless according the the guy who designed it, so why is that being used as an accurate measure of covid cases? I've recently seen a video from a nightclub in India where nobody wore a mask, and there was obviously no social distancing. They had a huge spike on cases in Leicester, UK last year but it turned out that they were testing more and more, therefore guaranteed to increase the number of cases based on a flawed testing system. You know the CDC have downgraded around 90% of covid deaths now, right?</p>

        <p>I can't speak to the UK hospital thing, I've not seen it. I thought you were attributing the article's report on India to the UK, so I was thrown by that.</p>
<p>The claims about PCR being called useless <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-who-pcr/fact-check-the-who-did-not-say-pcr-testsare-invalid-a-canadian-article-has-misrepresented-quotes-in-awhonotice-written-for-professionalscientists-idUSL1N2M10ID">by its creator and the WHO are literally fake news.</a></p>
<p>Similarly, so too have the multitude of claims about downgrading virus deaths been misinformation.</p>
<p>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53999403
https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/no-the-cdc-has-not-quietly-updated-covid-19-death-estimates-67902
https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/cdc-hasnt-reduced-covid-19-death-toll/</p>
<p>The CDC's own website reports 560k+ deaths, so I don't know where this is coming from: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days</p>

        <p>I can confirm that hospitals in Sonoma County in the Bay Area in California in the US aren’t being overwhelmed, but this fact doesn’t have anything to do with what’s happening in India rn. The UK has vaccinated like half of their population so idk why yr comparison would hold any weight regardless.</p>
<p>For some reason we in the west are capable of seeing images of war on the other side of the world and noting how bad those situations are (while we aren’t seeing any war in our own neighborhoods), but when covid ravages a foreign region, we are able to deny that it’s happening and ask for hard evidence.</p>
<p>(Actually scratch that— we are able to claim that such things are propaganda when doing so helps us conform to an extant perspective/political belief, so maybe that’s what we’re doing).</p>

        <p>Oh I do acknowledge it. But this just started more than ONE YEAE after we've gone into lockdown. Until now there has almost been no cases of covid without any lockdowns. What a coincidence that this mutation appears just now after India started to massively vaccinate the population. The same coincidence happened with the UK variant.</p>

        <p>It doesn't seem coincidental to me that after Indian PM Modi condoned mass maskless gatherings for religious and political purposes, there is a huge surge in cases and deaths. In fact, that sounds like exactly what I would expect to happen.</p>

        <p>I was wondering the same thing so I searched India on this sub.  There is a post alluding to the fact that most of the current deaths are because of vaccination not covid.  This sub just ignores actual world events.  It is such a weird place in here.</p>

        <p>I argued here a month ago with someone who pointed to the big unmasked protests in India as proof covid is fake. He didn't seem to get that it takes a while to contract and die from it. And now here we are.</p>
<p>I'm surprised I haven't been inundated with comments about how Reuters is fake news.</p>

        <p>And I hope they don't get an increase in cases, especially as more vaccinations are making it more unlikely. But again, this was literally the argument people used with India's mass gatherings, and now they <em>do</em> have a huge increases in cases. If gatherings without caution elsewhere don't, it doesn't mean that it couldn't have. It's like playing Russian Roulette, getting an empty click when you pull the trigger, and saying "it didn't happen that time, it won't happen next time."</p>
