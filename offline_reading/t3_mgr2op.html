    <strong>Anyone here ever seen the King of the Hill episode "Apres Hank, Le Deluge"?</strong>
    <p><p>In that episode, the town of Arlen is evacuated because of a coming flood and the evacuees are housed in the middle school gym. Bill Dauterive (for those who don't watch the show: a depressed loser who always obsessively latches on to anything that makes him not feel like a loser, be that bodybuilding to the point of rectal prolapse, going AWOL to sing with a men's chorus, playing Santa well into January, etc.) is made the shelter leader instead of Hank Hill (an all around competent, smart, and level-headed man) because he wore his dress uniform to the shelter and people assumed he was in charge. As shelter leader Bill is entirely incompetent but very well liked and the other evacuees see him as a hero. At the end of the episode it is revealed that the storm has been over for days and that Bill never told the people in the shelter because he didn't want to give up the authority and validation that he felt as shelter leader. </p>
<p>While that was going on, Hank was faced with the decision to open the floodgates to save the Arlen dam (and therefore most of the city). It's not made clear if opening them was actually necessary or just Hank being his usual overcautious self. When he gets to the shelter, Bill pins the blame on him as the Arlen Flooder. The episode ends with the people of Arlen loving Bill and hating Hank, the perception of their roles in the crisis being basically the opposite of reality.</p></p>

        <p>And the guy who’s supposed to be in charge of the dam completely throws Hank under the bus. </p>
<p>Hank is DeSantis, Bill is Cuomo, and Peggy is the doomers- regressing into childhood, waiting to be taken care of by Bill.</p>
