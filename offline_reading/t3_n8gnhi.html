        <p>OP Sources:</p>
<p><strong>On cancer,</strong> CBC News: https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cancer-tsunami-screening-delays-covid-1.5844708</p>
<p><strong>”Oncologist fears 'tsunami of cancer' after COVID-19 lockdowns limited screening”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;"What we're worried about, of course, is that there may be a tsunami of cancer out there that's going to suddenly show up," said Dr. Keith Stewart, director of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto. </p>
<p>&rt;Cancer specialists are worried about the significant drop in the number of cancer screening, referrals and diagnoses in Canada since the pandemic began in March.</p>
<p>&rt;It doesn't mean that cancer rates are dropping — experts say it means that cases are being missed and people aren't getting the treatment they need.</p>
<p>&rt;During the first wave of the pandemic — from March 15 to May 31 — there was a significant decrease in screening for three major cancers in Ontario compared to the same period in 2019, according to Ontario Health:
* A 97 per cent decrease in screening for mammograms through the Ontario Breast Screening Program.
* An 88 per cent decrease in Pap tests through the Ontario Cervical Screening Program.
* A 73 per cent decrease in fecal tests through ColonCancerCheck.</p>
<p>&rt;With less screening, there are fewer early diagnoses so people are presenting with more advanced cancers that are harder to treat successfully. </p>
<p>&rt;”The options for treatment are fewer, and the outcomes tend to be worse," said Stuart Edmonds, executive vice-president of mission at the Canadian Cancer Society.</p>

<p><strong>On opiod crisis,</strong> an archived Globe and Mail article: https://archive.is/TbRzt#selection-1805.0-1809.156</p>
<p>&rt;Drug supply changes, physical distancing measures and the curtailing of social services during the COVID-19 epidemic have led to a dramatic spike in overdose deaths in Ontario, with more than 2,200 people anticipated to be dead in 2020.
&rt;The grim figure, contained in a new report released Tuesday, is a 50-per-cent increase from the death toll of 2019, the province’s deadliest year on record.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>On suicides,</strong> CNN: https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/28/asia/japan-suicide-women-covid-dst-intl-hnk/index.html</p>
<p>&rt;In Japan, government statistics show suicide claimed more lives in October than Covid-19 has over the entire year to date. The monthly number of Japanese suicides rose to 2,153 in October, according to Japan's National Police Agency. As of Friday, Japan's total Covid-19 toll was 2,087, the health ministry said.</p>
<p>&rt;Japan is one of the few major economies to disclose timely suicide data -- the most recent national data for the US, for example, is from 2018. The Japanese data could give other countries insights into the impact of pandemic measures on mental health, and which groups are the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>&rt;”We didn't even have a lockdown, and the impact of Covid is very minimal compared to other countries ... but still we see this big increase in the number of suicides," said Michiko Ueda, an associate professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, and an expert on suicides.</p>
<p>&rt;”That suggests other countries might see a similar or even bigger increase in the number of suicides in the future."</p>
<p><strong>NOTE from OP on suicides:</strong> A deceptive article came out saying suicides are down from last year in the US. This is patently false as suicides are now listed as covid deaths because of the impact of the pandemic on mental health - when it’s the impact of our REACTION to the pandemic, namely lockdowns, that are at fault: </p>
<p><strong>The CDC counted 11,227  “Intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events” in their covid death counts:</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</p>
<p>&rt;Ontario counts suicide victims as COVID-19 fatalities. If someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 commits suicide, the Ontario Ministry of Health will record their cause of death as COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt; “COVID-19 cases marked as fatal are included in the public health reporting databases whether or not COVID-19 was determined to be a contributing or underlying cause of death. This is an inclusive approach to reporting on COVID-19 related deaths to ensure that all deaths linked to the disease are captured.”</p>

<p><strong>On global famine, maternal deaths and stillbirths:</strong> The New York Times archived article: https://archive.is/Y1JyQ#selection-389.0-389.79</p>
<p>&rt;Global hunger, maternal deaths and stillbirths have soared during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt;The number of people worldwide requiring urgent food aid hit a five-year high in 2020 — reaching at least 155 million — while the risk of maternal and newborn deaths surged because of a shortage of at least 900,000 midwives, or one-third of the required global midwifery work force, the United Nations said in a pair of reports produced with other groups.</p>

        <p>Even more catastrophic is the UN had to adjust their those at risk to famine numbers from 135 million to 260 million due to economic downturn caused by COVID policies.</p>
<p>More people will die from this than COVID. And unlike COVID, famine always comes for the young first.</p>
