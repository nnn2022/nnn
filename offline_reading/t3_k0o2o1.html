        <p>It is too scary and too much paperwork and cleanup to go into the real covid ward. You can film the same footage just by dressing up random people in PPE.</p>
<p>Fake footages and recycling footage has been a problem in media since forever. Sometimes it's the laziness, sometimes it's the lack of money to actually get to the place, sometimes it's safety (filming protests or wars is dangerous, and studio is safe). </p>
<p>COVID wards exist, they are not a conspiracy, I've seen one in my local hospital. People get sick, it happens.</p>

        <p>The problem is the news is not saying this. They're saying that this is all real and then they add their lil dash of unnecessary fear and you need to take it all at face value. Had they shown regular wards (which are also existent but less scary) with the patients not in space suits, people would yawn and stop faithfully listening. <em>That</em> is a problem.</p>
<p>Edit: I mistyped and it came out wrong. It is real, people are in the ICU, but not in the volumes they are suggesting for the reasons they are suggesting.</p>

        <p>They could've filmed the real COVID ward in a scary way. It is not hard to do. Scary stuff happens. People die sometimes. Having COVID on top of diabetes, asthma and amiloidosis is no fun, and dying people gasping for air is a scary thing to see. </p>
<p>However, 'quality is not our priority' and 'our viewers are so dumb they not gonna notice' is the attitude that leads to these cringey scewups. </p>
<p>Quality propaganda is possible. You can always find facts that suit you, and focus the spotlight on them. Some journalists just don't believe in quality, just like in any other profession there are people who try to do the minumum quality they can get away with, and coicidentally they rarely get away with that.</p>

<p>You are right about that, and what I typed didn't come out right. Its real, yeah, but their focus is on the very small percentage of those who warrant an ICU admission compared to the rest of the population, for the sole purpose of fearmongering, to the point where they feel the need to create a fake hospital setup to scare people. <em>Any</em> patient dying is no fun to watch, but they're making it seem like any case will turn into this.</p>

        <p>No one says covid doesn't exist- what we're saying is that there's no need to fake the shit.  Why fake it at all?  Because it creates fear and panic.  I also work in a hospital and I have not seen a single flu patient yet this year- nope- they're all covid patients.  Influenza took the year off.  </p>
<p>Why?  </p>
<p>Because the flu isn't scary and covid tests are easy to fake.  In fact, the Portugal court ruled that the PCR test has a track record of 97% false positives.  They ruled it unreliable.  NYT wrote an article stating that 90% are false positives.  The creator of the test- the guy who made it- said it's not a valid means for diagnosing a patient.  </p>
<p>Why? </p>
<p>Because hospitals and labs and testing sites everywhere are running cycles above 40.  You're not supposed to run it above 25.  Anything above 25 is a false positive.  That's why it has only a 10% (at most) accuracy in diagnosing covid-19.  Hell, even the FDA declared it unreliable in the test's documentation.  </p>
<p>So yeah, that's why this was faked.  If hospitals and testing sites tested properly and if the media was honest, covid wouldn't be scary anymore.  The WHO has begged people to stop using lockdowns.  The CDC has declared the death rate to be 0.003%.  Can't we stop being afraid of what's been proven to be just the flu?</p>

<p>Because it is easier and cheaper.</p>
<p>Real COVID ward footage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a hospital that will give you a tour</li>
<li>Driving there</li>
<li>Doing all the cleansing to go in and out (including the equipment)</li>
<li>Endangering yourself and your family (journos are themselves scared of the virus)</li>
<li>Dealing with private medical information (real hospitals will not let you film peoples faces)</li>
</ol>
<p>Fake  COVID ward footage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab 3 PAs</li>
<li>Dress them up in PPE</li>
<li>Film it in the studio, no need to go anywhere</li>
</ol>
<p>This is why</p>

        <p>I work in a hospital.   And it's still not worth faking.  I have worked in this hospital for years and I'm not anymore afraid of covid than I am of influenza.  They both do the exact same thing, but the flu is worse because it strikes every single year and kills more healthy young people than covid.</p>
<p>Covid tests are 90% false positives as per the NYT and the Portugal Court.  It's unreliable as per the FDA and the creator of the test.</p>
<p>There is NO REASON TO BE IN A COVID WARD AS A TV CREW.  They shouldn't have faked it because it's stupid for them to even be in one in the first place.</p>
