        <p>My dad (71) passed away from a stroke on March 10th, 7 days after his 2nd Phizer vaccine. I'll never know if he'd still be alive had he not taken it. I'll be the first to say that it may be a coincidence, but especially the Phizer vaccine has increased chances of stroke. I will never know. He certainly wasn't counted as a vaccine death, and they have no way to know if it was or not. Had he tested positive for Covid, he would have been counted in those numbers though, even if it had been an unrelated stroke. So there's that.</p>

        <p>Honestly it's probably the same story as the virus, it kills people who had underlying conditions. Many of whom didn't know about them. </p>
<p>I hate that in order to travel as normal I had to get the vaccine as I'm in my 20s and fit and healthy and would have survived covid, most likely without even noticing. But I also didn't notice the vaccine effects. It sucks that we got to this point but if you wouldn't die from the virus, then barring allergies, you're not likely to suffer from the vaccine.</p>
<p>I survived Dengue fever twice (once barely symptomatic, once severe) I know that I have a decent immune system. The vaccine didn't kill me as neither would the virus. It sucks but I've forced to take it by government intervention. If you had nothing to worry about from getting the virus then you have nothing to worry about from getting the vaccine which puts everyone who is healthy in a lose-lose situation due to government overreach.</p>

        <p>Yeah it sucks because, I’m in my 20’s like you, and the line of work I’m planning on going into involves me living overseas. If they require the vaccine to travel internationally I’m not sure what I’ll do. </p>
<p>My main concern with the vaccine is not knowing how it could affect having children, and that’s not really something I want to take a risk with. If I had already had kids and wasn’t planning on having anymore I don’t think I’d care as much.</p>

        <p>I got a bunch of spermies frozen so don't have to worry about that. But I highly doubt it will affect male fertility enough to cause issues in the majority of the general population, female fertility is far more fragile. Either way I'm not too worried about anyone's fertility, but the long term health effects aren't studied. The ones more sensitive to it will die and not reproduce, those who can survive it will and will most likely be able to reproduce. Even if only some can still reproduce there's no way they figured out even remotely close to 50% sterility in 2 jabs.</p>
<p>IE I'm not worried about fertility but I am scared of lymph node cancer or something. Even still, by the time it could affect me I'll have had a decently long life.</p>

        <p>I know this happened, but I have some real questions and concerns.</p>
<p>This is the same problem I see with a lot of media, picking back incidents because that's what makes money. They did the same thing during the BLM stuff, early days of war on terror, during the bath salt stuff.</p>
<p>What is the actual rate of adverse reaction of COVID vaccine? Is it comparable to the flu or tetanus vaccine?</p>
<p>What constitutes an adverse reaction? I remember my arm being sore and stiff for days after tetanus shot, but no health issues. Does that count?</p>
<p>I'm not making light of deaths from anything, I just feel like these are questions that should be asked.</p>

        <p>I dont remember having an adverse reaction to any vaccine. However, I know this is anecdotal, but I know people who've had bad reactions. My mom had to take off work. Both doses made her sick. My aunt got sick. Several people said they had fevers of over 100. </p>
<p>I dont know if the cdc is tracking reactions, but they seem common in my circle. Yet I know a 70 year old who had covid and only had indigestion and a thrown off sense of smell. He still got the vax. </p>
<p>"Its better than catching Covid," is what I hear.</p>

        <p>I cant be certain but I'm pretty sure I caught it and it just felt like a really nasty flu. Never had the breathing problems but everything else was there and it was strong, lasted about 7 days.</p>
<p>My biggest concern is that it has no FDA authorization and was extremely rushed. A valiant effort by Trump and any sciency types who worked on it, but I'm gonna wait a few years to see what happens.</p>

        <p>I just want to state I agree that yes, the vaccine will cause deaths and it's good it's being reported/looked into and it's good to discuss the cons of a vaccine.</p>
<p>However, I have a legitimate question for you all, not trolling. If the vaccine is truly this dangerous/deadly, why am I not seeing bodies droping everywhere? Most posts here go on about how no one is dying from covid, it's a hoax, if it was as bad as the news says there would be bodies all over the streets. But on the other hand, I keep seeing posts here about how the majority or a great number of people are droping dead from the vaccine and how it's gonna severely harm most people who get it. </p>
<p>I feel like it's two sides of the same coin. You got some people out here saying the vaccine is harmless  but covid is the deadliest disease ever. And then you got this sub where the vaccine is the deadliest thing ever but covid is just a cold/not real. I feel like both sides are trying take have their cake and eat it too, and I'm just curious why you see one as being the most dangerous thing ever, and the other completely harmless.</p>
<p>Anecdotal: Fwiw, I am fully vaccinated against covid, and the most me or anyone I know has just experienced typical vaccine side effects. Also, while I know people who got covid, most recovered although I know a few people who died.</p>

        <p>The difference is that the government paid hospitals more if people died with COVID. People "with" COVID were counted as COVID deaths no matter what. People "with" the vaccine who die are considered by the government to have died from some underlying condition.<br>
Less than one percent either way so there's really no pandemic. And no reason to be under a state of emergency everywhere. People are dying at the same rate, just classified differently.<br>
If there was no government reaction and some people were worried about a harsher cold (corona) going around this year then people would or wouldn't get the vaccine and nobody would even notice.<br>
Just like any year, I'd be like...sucks for those taking the vaccine but that's their choice. No big deal.<br>
But all signs point to forced vaccinations. We will be injected without our consent. If you do not believe the government would do something like that you may have missed a whole year of people being confined to their homes by the same government that you claim would not do something so horrible as injecting the unwilling.<br>
So yes, we will point out how dangerous this is and that it isn't some harmless procedure that we should just go ahead and do "for the good of society". It is a possible death sentence.</p>

        <p>You bring up a good point. I really hate how lenient a covid death is, and I think the covid death/infection rates are inaccurate. I do disagree with you on covid not being a pandemic, as even though most people do not die, it's still infectious and spread all over the globe. I do believe that covid killed a significant amount of people than would have died in a year without covid, but again, whatever actual number they have out is bullshit. This goes both ways, as I believe some countries underreported their deaths, and others overreported.</p>
<p>I do think the government is shitty in multiple ways. And I agree, it looks like it will end up in some forced vaccination. While I'm very much pro-vaccine and think everyone who can get it should, you shouldn't have it forced onto you. (Although I have different opinions towards children getting the usual, non-covid, vaccines, but that's a completely different debate). Double standards have been awful, especially with people preaching one thing and doing another. I'm vaccinated, as are most of my peers (nursing students) yet I'm still supposed to wear a mask whenever I do anything, even if it's meeting in a small study group with others who are vaccinated. I understand that we can still be vectors for the disease, but at what point do they let up? It's pretty bad that they don't have a end in site yet.</p>
<p>Just wanted to add I really appreciate the response. I enjoy conversing with people who have different opinions and beliefs :)</p>

        <p>Thank you for the reasonable response. Unfortunately for the medical field this whole thing has made trusting medical professionals very difficult. My wife almost died because our first thought when she had a medical problem was not going to the hospital but staying away from doctors, with the possibility of becoming quarantined.</p>
<p>Fortunately the pain was too much for her to bear and I got her to the emergency room. She would not have made it otherwise.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry to hear about your wife, but I am glad things ended well. That's the part of the pandemic that isn't talked about enough- as people have been avoiding seeking care because of the fear of either getting covid or an unnecessary quarantine. I'm fortunate to have not experienced anything like that, but my heart breaks from stories like your wife or those news articles back from last spring of women who had to give birth alone, without their partner. </p>
<p>I think the government has definitely fueled this medical distrust. I hate how politicized everything with the pandemic became. I cannot wait for the day where people don't have to fear seeking healthcare, be it from covid related fears, medical distrust, or financial ones.</p>

        <p>Well I live in the UK where the covid deaths count as any death that occurs within 28 days of a positive test unless there is another obvious cause of death e.g trauma </p>
<p>You've always got to consider the longer lasting effects of covid, the damage that it has and the deaths that have occurred because of it which don't count as covid because it has left the system </p>
<p>My point still stands, the vaccine doesn't make you immortal and people are going to die after taking it, doesn't mean its from the vaccine</p>

<p>Deaths that are completely unrelated to covid, covid is found in the body, that's a covid death. Put it on the stats. Totally okay with you.</p>
<p>Completely healthy people dying immediately after taking a vaccine. You don't see any link there.</p>

<p>Clearly you didn't read what I said properly, any death that occurs after 28 days of a positive test is counted as a death UNLESS there is an obvious cause of death e.g trauma, so for example if I get tested and it's positive and then on the way home I get ran over it won't be counted as a covid death because I got hit by a car</p>

<p>What would you constitute a 'link'.  There are a growing number of these accounts where people who were not medically compromised, had life-changing injuries or deaths anywhere from a matter of hours to a few days after being administered the vaccine. </p>
<p>Short of the vaccine literally popping up and saying 'hi, that was me by the way', what kind of link are you expecting?  Are you that <strong>determined</strong> to reject logic when it's currently slapping you round the face like a stale kipper?</p>

<p>What do you think constitutes as a link? It'd be obvious if there was a link or not to the death but when the point of post is to paint vaccines as something dangerous and they use headlines saying there was no link between the vaccine and the death its kinda stupid and pointless </p>

        <p>I'm just exhausted, day in, day out, of talking to people like you.  Nothing anyone says to you will make a difference.  Nothing.</p>
<p>You're clearly a troll.  I think the link constitutes a link.  You know how if you have a house, and the walls are fine.  And you live in it for 5 years.  Then you buy a plant.  And the very next day, there's a patch of mold on the wall over the plant.  And then you say, nope, I don't see a connection.   Yeah, I'm done with you.</p>
<p>Also vaccines, in general, save a lot of lives.  Said vaccines have been proven, for a lengthy trial period, and then in some cases for decades more.  But the covid vaccines haven't.  And they use experimental techniques that haven't ever been tested prior to the 'pandemic'.</p>
<p>Also, as has been proven...globally...daily, whereas the prevalence of covid-deaths occur among the elderly, the side effects of the covid vaccines have been more occurrent among younger people; and remember the vaccines have tended to be distributed downwards in age - the fact that cases of side effects are growing is especially disturbing as it points to a trend of younger people being more susceptible.</p>
<p>This means, in case you aren't following, that there is a greater chance of someone younger having serious side effects or death from the vaccine, than if they contract covid.  </p>
<p>And that includes any 'long covid' anecdotes you're ready to throw back; there's no proof that it's any more unique than long-term effects some people get from the flu.</p>

        <p>Because they died within a short amount of time after getting the vaccine isnt good enough evidence that they died from the vaccine, I understand your point and analogy but it just isn't like that. If I said that someone tested positive for covid and then the next day they died with no links to covid you'd say nope, doesn't count.</p>
<p>Clearly someone as educated as you should know how the reasons how and why the covid vaccines were made within a year compared to other vaccines which take, in case you don't ( I wouldn't be suprised ) I'll tell you. Funding and volunteers. The covid vaccines have had tremendous amounts of money pumped into them so they can get made as quickly as possible, they pretty much had unlimited funding and therefore didn't have to wait for more money. Another factor is volunteers, it takes a long time to get enough volunteers to get fair and effective trials, for example in the US alone there were 32,000 volunteers for just the AstraZeneca vaccine. Another reason it took so little time is because its just another strain of coronavirus which we've already studied and have vaccines for, this virus isn't anything new. In the UK (idk about america) there's 4 new flu vaccines every year to combat the flu season for that year, it changes every year, I don't hear anyone complaining about how quickly they come out.</p>
<p>Now I'm unaware of the differences between the effects of long covid and long-term effects from the flu </p>
<p>Common long COVID symptoms include:</p>
<p>extreme tiredness (fatigue)</p>
<p>shortness of breath</p>
<p>chest pain or tightness</p>
<p>problems with memory and concentration ("brain fog")</p>
<p>difficulty sleeping (insomnia)</p>
<p>heart palpitations</p>
<p>dizziness</p>
<p>pins and needles</p>
<p>joint pain</p>
<p>depression and anxiety</p>
<p>tinnitus, earaches</p>
<p>feeling sick, diarrhoea, stomach aches, loss of appetite</p>
<p>a high temperature, cough, headaches, sore throat, changes to sense of smell or taste</p>
<p>rashes</p>
<p>Compared to flu complications </p>
<p>Sinus and ear infections are examples of moderate complications from flu, while pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from co-infection of flu virus and bacteria. Other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis) or muscle (myositis, rhabdomyolysis) tissues, and multi-organ failure (for example, respiratory and kidney failure). Flu virus infection of the respiratory tract can trigger an extreme inflammatory response in the body and can lead to sepsis, the body’s life-threatening response to infection. Flu also can make chronic medical problems worse. For example, people with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have flu, and people with chronic heart disease may experience a worsening of this condition triggered by flu.</p>
<p>This covid strain is something and we're always finding out new stuff about it, there's lots of other things missing from the covid list such as loss of taste and smell. I wouldn't compare covid to the flu anyway, covid is far more dangerous.</p>
<p>The techniques aren't experimental, they've been studied and tested for a decade, for example Zika, influenza and Rabies trials used the RNA method so it was tested before this pandemic.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that younger groups are around 10% more likely to show side effects from the vaccine than older groups however a side effect could be anything, the most dominant side effect is pain at the site of injection which I think is a small price to pay to be getting effective and proven safe vaccines </p>
<p>Anyway I want to know why you brought up half this stuff? The conversation was meant to be purely about the news headlines but you somehow brought up a bunch of random stuff.</p>

        <p>I actually don't think it would be a very easy thing to say conclusively that the vaccine was the cause. From my admittedly limited understanding of these things all they can really say for sure is that they recently got the vaccine and then something killed them. I don't think it would be obvious unless it was super common or if someone noticed a commonality. So in short, the articles say "no link found" and such, cause they don't know for sure. It could be a coincidence, it could be the vaccine, I don't know if they've studied it enough yet. Based on the complaints I've heard about vaccine side effects though, it wouldn't surprise me if it could contribute to the death of someone who was sick to begin with.</p>
