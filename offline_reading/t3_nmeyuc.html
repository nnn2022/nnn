    <strong>Beyond anything else, aren't you ANGRY?</strong>
    <p><p>Politicians and bigshots now have deleted a full year of our lives we'll never get back under the pretext of a <em>pandemic</em>.</p>
<p>But it's leaking. It's leaking everywhere. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any health professional with a different discourse is being silenced or discredited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you look past the propaganda, you learn that most "COVID deaths" were very old and vulnerable, and would have probably died from the seasonal flu at this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also know people dying from countless reasons are being tagged as 'died from COVID'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their creepy insistence on taking the experimental shot. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want proof something is <em>really wrong</em>, just look at Australia, or New Zealand, who keep locking down millions for a handful of cases (not sick people, CASES). Wash, rinse and repeat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many have alluded to a <em>new normal</em>. Justin Trudeau recently said that the <em>vaccines</em> won't be enough, that we'll have to keep masking and distancing afterwards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I just hope these f***ers will be tried and executed for crimes against humanity.</p></p>

        <p>What makes me most angry is peoples' ignorance and tolerance towards what's going on. All of this shit is happening because these brainwashed, obedient morons keep allowing it. They keep saying "Just a little more. Almost there. Just a little more". Step by step we watch governments around the world remove peoples' rights, and the historically ignorant sheep just keep allowing it!</p>
<p>We've been tricked into fighting each other while the government skims off endless trillions of dollars and implements tyrannical measures. The ignorant deserve what they get, but I'm so sick and tired of being dragged into their stupidity. This crap is the reason I'm a libertarian.</p>

        <p>I wish there was a fairly simple way to split up. Just break our country into two countries, one where people live caged up for perceived safety, and one where everyone is left alone to live how we see fit and public health is basically waste management services and occasional advisories ("pollen count is high today, if you have allergies be aware" etc.)</p>
<p>Secession is possible, but since the political divide isn't strictly regional, it would get messy.</p>

        <p>I'm planning on going to grad school to further my career in healthcare, but if this keeps up, there is no way I can progress in that sector without getting a vaccine and bending over to the fearmongering and propaganda. I need to sacrifice my medical autonomy in order to pursue my career, or at least that seems where we're headed.</p>
<p>The hopes and dreams of our youth is being put behind a paywall, and the price is our freedom of choice and taking government poison. You're god damn right I'm angry, because much of what I've worked for in my career will go down the shitter unless I go against my principles and my beliefs.</p>
<p>We should all be fucking angry.</p>

        <p>Not really angry, confused. I think the biggest reason why the theatrics and hysteria creep me out so much is because this pandemic has not affected me at all. I don’t say that in a selfish way, as in it hasn’t affected my health, but no one I know has had it. The people I know whos friends / distant family members may have gotten it were perfectly fine. One of whom took ivermectin and it cleared up in 2 days. According to many people on Reddit this was an anti-science Trump voter. I haven’t seen anybody keeling over in a store coughing up a lung or anything..</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing has changed except more people wearing masks. If nobody wore them the pandemic would cease to exist. It is the only thing keeping it alive.</p>
<p>This is being worded quite poorly, I’m just saying it’s like you had to play along with mass psychosis and then act as though you were affected by it the same way others were. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Are you the type of person like me that doesn’t like the music you hear on the radio? You don’t wanna see the latest superhero movie? You may not even use social media? Well then why are we surprised if we don’t follow the same group think for the popular health trend.</p>

        <p>I hear you. We've avoided the "news" for the last ten years or so, tend to keep a low (social media) profile and generally don't care what anyone thinks. "Playing along with a mass psychosis" is how I've felt since the beginning.. I didn't sign up for this ride.</p>
<p>I just smile, nod and change the subject as quickly as I can.</p>
