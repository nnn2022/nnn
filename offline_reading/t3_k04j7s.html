    <strong>Thanksgiving gatherings</strong>
    <p><p>First time posting here..almost feel guilty like I have to look over my shoulder. But I wanted to have a discussion on the recommendation to cancel thanksgiving gatherings with family. 
Iâ€™m trying to be responsible (I have a newborn baby and also care about the grandparentsâ€™ health). It seems wrong that weâ€™re being told we canâ€™t share a meal with family members but  itâ€™s still ok to go to Walmart. It just doesnâ€™t add up. 
Also, I had Covid (while pregnant no less) and I was fine. My kids all got it and barely had the sniffles. 
So Iâ€™m trying to balance what I know from personal experience (the virus is like any other cold) vs the total doom I see in the media. 
Also the extreme guilting and being made to feel like youâ€™re somehow weird or delusional if you donâ€™t think Covid is super scary.
I mean...people are dying right? Hospitals are struggling...right? It canâ€™t all be a lie. I want to do my part to help my fellow humans but at the same time Iâ€™m having a hard time believing all of it. 
My kids want to see their grandparents, and Iâ€™m tired of being isolated. I canâ€™t decide whether to go to thanksgiving or not. My husband also works in a high exposure setting (law enforcement). Itâ€™s hard to know the right thing to do sometimes. 
What is everyone here doing? ðŸ¦ƒ</p></p>

        <p>If youâ€™ve all had it you wonâ€™t give it to people. This is the first time since weâ€™ve understood viruses that people are suggesting that people get re-infected. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m not sure what your concern really is. If they feel ok coming over itâ€™s not an issue. Apparently Cuomo is having is elderly mother over. </p>
<p>Sure people are dying, itâ€™s not a fake disease. But you do realize people are dying every day of flus and other viruses before all of this? Your parents could die in a crash on the way over but you probably donâ€™t even consider that.</p>

        <p>well, you were told you and the kids had covid if you can believe anything you hear.</p>
<p>if it was a PCR test, there are all sorts of problems with that.</p>
<p>people are dying right ? yes, but oddly at the same rates as years prior.</p>
<p>Hospitals are struggling...right?   nope.</p>
<p>ASK YOUR GRANDPARENTS , ASK WHO IS HOSTING.</p>
<p>if they feel at risk, they should act accordingly.</p>

        <p>Husband tested positive and definitely had it from his work. The rest of us got sick at the same time with the same symptoms so just assuming we had it. Then I tested positive during labor and delivery but I wasnâ€™t sick anymoreâ€¦ It was a week after my symptoms disappeared.
Itâ€™s been a couple months so I would think we would still be immune? </p>
<p>Anyways, none of the family who is hosting Thanksgiving is worried about Covid at all. They are very relaxed about it. I guess Iâ€™m the one who has some reservations just because of everything Iâ€™m seeing in the media. The government and pretty much everyone surrounding me is pretty adamant that we should not be holding Thanksgiving get togethers.
   But it just doesnâ€™t seem to add up to me.</p>

        <p>You are immune and so is the rest of your family that had it. Think about past years. Thanksgiving is always during the flu season is it not? Your grandparents are probably already susceptible to certain things like the flu and Covid is not any worse. By all means I'm not saying you're grandparents shouldn't be cautious during this season but this year is no different than any other year. The msm would just like you to believe it is.</p>

        <p>Not trying to be harsh... but what threat do you pose to your parents if your entire family has already had covid? </p>
<p>Have they seen they grandchild yet? Do they want to see you for the holiday?</p>
