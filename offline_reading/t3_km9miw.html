    <strong>where did peoples' sense of respect even go???</strong>
    <p><p>Here are some replies I got on Pinterest after commenting on the uselessness/idocy  of masks and the vaccine:</p>
<p>(My original comment)</p>
<p>"MASKS DON'T WORK!! I don't wear one and there is no way on God's green earth i will ever take the vaccine. Ya'll really are a bunch of hypocrites. You go on and on about "my body my choice". But you FREAK out when someone is doing something like not wearing a mask. Last I checked it's still their body. You also say that masks are "effective" because you can't lie with science and science doesn't change. But DR FAUCI (an idiot) SAID MASKS WERE NOT EFFECTIVE AGAINST COVID. But now they are? Wow, yep science completely changed within a matter of days didn't it? They don’t work, sorry for bursting your fake safety bubble. I got COVID when I was wearing my mask everywhere. I don’t wear one now. It’s my choice. You have your choice too, and I respect that. “My body my choice” remember?? Y’all crazy. Also, I don’t support abortions, I’m just quoting y’all. Abortion is murder. Also, the survival rate for COVID is 99.6%, just sayin’.You'll just blindly follow orders like sheep. Do research, make your OWN opinions."</p>
<p>(the replies)</p>
<p>" shut your white trumpanzee a** up girl"</p>
<p>" JUST WEAR YOUR FRICKING MASK PERIOD"</p>
<p>"don’t wear a mask and get corona, maybe that’ll help with population control"</p>
<p>"just wear the mask it takes no effort on your part to put a piece of cloth over your mouth and face"</p>
<p>"Love, if you're not going to get the vaccine, ok, nobody here could care less wiether you die or not"</p>
<p>These are from people who "care about everyone's lives".  I checked a lot of their bios, and they all say things like "No judgment or hate here" "BLACK LIVES MATTER" "My body, my choice" Give me a break. Can they not see their own idiosyncrasy?  I am ashamed to be a part of my own generation.</p></p>

        <p>This is about left-wing political control over society. It’s very political. Your generation doesn’t get it, but there’s a reason why millions fought against and resisted communism. Regardless of how Gen Z hipsters frame it, communism was brutally inhumane. That’s what this is, communism. The science of the virus almost doesn’t matter. The destruction of small business and in particular restaurants and mom-and-pop retailers is the modern equivalent of “liquidating the Kulaks” (middle class farmers) in Bolshevik Russia. You take out the middle class and then the academic/intellegentsia/media classes take over and put a brutal yoke on the working class. Everyone who can see this is fighting back.</p>

        <p>Because they have spent the last 4 years being congratulated for being extremely hateful people because Hillary wasn’t handed the presidency like she deserved.  This is how they think normal, rational people are supposed to act.</p>
<p>I am sure a percentage of them also proudly have the Hate has no home here signs in their front yards or windows and are unable to see the irony.</p>

        <p>my favorite type of comment... "don’t wear a mask and get corona, maybe that’ll help with population control" and "if you're not going to get the vaccine, ok, nobody here could care less whether you die or not" </p>
<p>As if catching coronavirus=instant death and the only thing to save you from instant coronavirus death is a rushed vaccine. How are people this delusional after almost a year? Turn off the TV, folks.</p>

<p>I know the feeling. Many in my circle of acquaintances are like that but in the next breath will talk about needing to silence those not in agreement with all their stances. I consent with my silence about it because I dislike conflict. Believe speech, even those we disagree with, should be tolerated. </p>
<p>Don't think it's your generation. Think it has always been like this. Unsure what the answer is.</p>

        <p>There's been one RCT study conducted on masks and it could not conclude that they were effective. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">Here. </a> Then there's the recent study from the University of Florida which proves there's no asymptomatic or presymptomatic spread, so it doesn't make sense to mask healthy people. And then there's the obvious that microscopic virus particles are gonna get through the spaces in the fabric in the millions. I personally don't care if they work, I care if they're effective. Specifically, effective enough to justify a mandate.</p>
