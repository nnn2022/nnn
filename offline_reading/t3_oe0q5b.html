    <strong>Old literature shows us that following the mainstream media and everything society expects of you is the perfect path to be an unhappy nobody.</strong>
    <p><p>Never in history the perfect citizen in the eyes of the government was a free and happy one. Censorship in a totalitarian state has always been an issue being fought against. This is no different in the world we have today with every government wanting you to get a jab, wear a mask, listen to MSM and never complain.</p>
<p>I'd like to illustrate that with a poem from 1939:</p>
<h1>The Unknown Citizen</h1>
<p><em>W. H. Auden</em></p>
<p><em>(To JS/07 M 378</em><br>
<em>This Marble Monument</em><br>
<em>Is Erected by the State)</em></p>
<p>He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be<br>
One against whom there was no official complaint,<br>
And all the reports on his conduct agree<br>
That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a saint,<br>
For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.<br>
Except for the War till the day he retired<br>
He worked in a factory and never got fired,<br>
But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.<br>
Yet he wasn't a scab or odd in his views,<br>
For his Union reports that he paid his dues,<br>
(Our report on his Union shows it was sound)<br>
And our Social Psychology workers found<br>
That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.<br>
The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day<br>
And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.<br>
Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,<br>
And his Health-card shows he was once in hospital but left it cured.<br>
Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare<br>
He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Instalment Plan<br>
And had everything necessary to the Modern Man,<br>
A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire.<br>
Our researchers into Public Opinion are content<br>
That he held the proper opinions for the time of year;<br>
When there was peace, he was for peace: when there was war, he went.<br>
He was married and added five children to the population,<br>
Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his generation.<br>
And our teachers report that he never interfered with their education.<br>
Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd:<br>
Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.</p></p>
