    <strong>Fucking CovIdiots.</strong>
    <p><p>I thought this pandemic would unite America, but instead, you decided to take the rona's side. You're the main reason this pandemic didn't end after two weeks.</p>
<p>All you have been asked to do was wear a facemask properly in public, and not stand super close to strangers. The latter of which I thought people generally preferred anyways, but apparently are willing to get up in arms about regardless.</p>
<p>The death toll, the economic fall out, the irreparable damage to the next generation's lives, it's all your fault.</p>
<p>When you go to sleep tonight, please have a good thought about your actions and their consequences.</p></p>

        <p>Can you please tell me what any government in Canada or the US has done to increase hospital beds, ICU capacity, and staffing levels in the last 10 months? And by how much?</p>
<p>Or, have they all committed fully to the sole strategy of blaming and punishing the public? </p>
<p>Destroying businesses, careers, and mental health. Restricting freedom of movement and assembly. Treating us like children, or so many denizens of halfway houses on probation for the imagined crime of maybe being sick.</p>
<p>I said it in March and it has become more apparent with each passing month… there is a complete void in the western world where leadership should be. Such a lack of vision, imagination, and resourcefulness, that all anyone can think of is a pale mimicry of the policies of the authoritarian communist dictatorship in China. Only with less zeal and more greed, as the profiteering and cronyism we excel at here accelerates.</p>
<p>And we as a people have proven ourselves spineless. Too decadent, spoiled, and cowardly to risk living our lives and maybe getting a virus mild in comparison to what our ancestors witnessed around them every day of their lives.</p>
<p>So disrespectful that we take zero risk to stand up for the rights for which our forefathers bled and died to give us. </p>
<p>It's a cop out to say it's temporary; it's insane to say this is an emergency worthy of setting this dangerous precedent. </p>
<p>We don't deserve to be given better; what we need to do is demand and fight for better. Expect to be given what you ask for. If you want to be controlled and directed, to mollify a manufactured fear, we will surely continue to get that, and only that. Enjoy the nanny state.</p>

        <p>Ontario has 384 hospitals, and 385 people in ICU and 10,000 in acute care with the rona. We have capacity for almost 3,000 in ICU's with ventilators, over 21,000 acute care beds. These are all for Covid. Flu and influenza is so low during flu season it's not being tracked. Can you please explain to me how our hospital system is at the breaking point. I used something called math, and it's not adding up to over 90% capacity. Can you tell me why the government is not disclosing covid deaths solely but grouping them with comorbidities?</p>

        <p>I'm actually not really into Reddit. I'm not browsing many other subreddits. I've been posting a lot here lately sharing facts and experiences, but I get downvoted each time. Literally posts describing what I go through living in a COVID hotspot city. So now I have to wait 10 minutes between each post because of the low karma, because people thought my contributions "do not contribute <strong>to</strong> the <strong>subreddit</strong>" (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette?v=705a6c52-2c8d-11e3-8bb1-12313b0230fe">https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette?v=705a6c52-2c8d-11e3-8bb1-12313b0230fe</a>).

        <p>Maybe. The purpose of the sub though is:</p>
<p>&rt; Discussion about skepticism regarding the "new normal" that stems from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
<p>Would that not include counterpoints to the skepticism? Or, is the idea that because the people here perceive the rest of the internet as an echo chamber (when people share facts about COVID with them), that this place is allowed to be an echo chamber for anti-lockdown folks? A safe space of sorts?</p>

        <p>Hey, fellow Torintinian here. Did a quick scroll through your posts, hoping to verify your claims. But...</p>
<p>A) hell of a lot of comments for someone "not really into Reddit"
B) All I saw related to Covid was conjecture and parroting Doug Ford and MSM. Not "facts and experiences".</p>
<p>So, no. I'm happy for real counter points and intellectual debate. Even shit-disturbing humour. But this isn't what I saw.</p>

        <p>I think we're coming from two completely different perspectives. I shared information about masks and COVID, including links to what I consider reputable sources, like the WHO. I also talked about the measures my work took and how I changed my daily habits as a public transit user in Toronto. That's what I meant by facts and experiences. If you don't believe the WHO is a reputable source, then I understand why you don't think my contributions were useful.</p>
<p>Regarding Doug Ford, I'm not "parroting" him. I'm acknowledging reality, including measures the government has put into place. Believe me, I wish he'd be gone. I've donated to political campaigns against PC MPP candidates and I regularly spend time with a local transit advocacy group in the city to work against the damage he does. But this is different. It isn't political, it's us working together to navigate a pandemic. Seeing you use the term "MSM" also shows me how out of sync we are. If you don't trust the media, the sources I've shared here will of course mean nothing to you.</p>

        <p>Yes, the WHO that said don't wear masks, and that lockdowns are not an effective solution. Organizations that talk out of both sides of their mouth and say virtually everything aren't reliable for anything. Kind of like Trump. </p>
<p>And yes, if you think CBC is a thorough and reliable source of information on Covid, then we aren't going to agree on much.</p>
<p>Regardless, Reddit is built for echo chambers.  Subs for like minded people. It's fine if you want a dust up, but keep your expectations realistic 😉</p>

        <p>Noted. My expectation was downvotes. I shall take them in stride. :P</p>
<p>I am an open minded person. I've actually learned a few things so far reading things people have shared here. Notably that cloth masks aren't considered very effective (surgical masks really are the only type considered effective) and that the WHO may at some point in time have recommended against lockdowns. I'm aware of them switching their position on masks, but I understand why. I'm not aware of their positions on lockdowns though, including the details and whether they've changed their position on it. I'll need to look into it.</p>
