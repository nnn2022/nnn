        <p>California is one of the only states with a recall law. No recall law in Maryland, no recall law in Delaware, etc. etc. etc.</p>

        <p>&rt;Recall organizers say they have collected more than half the nearly 1.5 million petition signatures needed to place the recall on the ballot, and they have until mid-March to hit the required threshold.</p>
<p>Only halfway there? After an entire year of this tyrannical bullshit? </p>
<p>Jesus, California.</p>

        <p>A big part of me believes that Newsom's political agenda is to humiliate Californians as much as possible. His entire administration is so incredibly embarrassing, I don't know how any of his supporters find the dignity to even make eye contact or look in the mirror. </p>
<p>While the parking lot was shut down at my local park and beach over the 4th of July, with tape and warning signs around every playground, his winery in Napa remained open for tastings.</p>
<p>The PlumpJack Group (different restaurants and bars he partially owns) received about $3 million in covid aid money via PPP loans. One particular entity he has an ownership stake in, with 14 employees, received almost $1 million in covid aid. The average aid for a California small business with 14 employees is ~ $130,000.</p>
<p>His Aunt (Nancy Pelosi) got caught getting a blowout without a mask inside a salon in San Francisco. All the salons in the area were restricted from indoor operations due to his covid restrictions. Around that same time, I had to stand up directly outside a salon, with a trash bag over me and a mask, to get a haircut in the sun. The honorable Speaker claimed she had been set up by the salon, and then demanded an apology (???). </p>
<p>He then gets caught at the French Laundry, at a birthday party with lobbyists, inside without a mask, zero social distancing. The cost of the dinner was about the same amount as the only stimulus check Americans received during this 'pandemic'. He then had the audacity to lie and say the dinner was outside, even though there are pictures of him inside? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, already $400 million in fraudulent unemployment benefits have been incorrectly paid out. Convicted murderers, as well as state and local inmates are among the recipients. One DA thinks the total fraudulent payments may amount to $1 billion. So incarcerated murders are getting unemployment, while law abiding citizens are still waiting? </p>
<p>Even if covid made people explode on contact, that would still not excuse Newsom's behavior. If Californians don't recall him at this point, I think we should just build an impenetrable dome around the state and move on.</p>
