    <strong>We should create a government petition.</strong>
    <p><p>Let's all start a petition and hand it around. We can get it into parlament and maybe they'll consider giving us some freedom again.</p>
<p>I'm cracking up as I write this.</p>
<p>The entire system is broken. Change starts with the people. Stop being obedient.</p>
<p>Here's what change you can make:</p>
<p>Take off your mask. Never put one in your pocket again. When some authoritarian prick gets in your business and tells you to put it on, tell them "I don't wear masks". When they ask "do you have an exemption?" tell them "it's none of your business". They'll fuck straight off.</p>
<p>Here's the game changed: Start telling other people to the same thing. ANYONE who looks like they don't want to wear their mask, say "You look like you don't want to wear that". When they say "Not really" tell them to take it off. Tell them what I just told you - "This is how you stand up for yourself". And tell them to spread the word.</p></p>
