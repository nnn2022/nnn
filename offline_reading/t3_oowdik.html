    <strong>I‚Äôve been o serving those around me who are double vaccinated and it‚Äôs been interesting.</strong>
    <p><p>They seem different and not in a good way.
I‚Äôm only making a generalized observation and, by no means, attempting to state that they ARE different or the vaccine has done <em>something</em> to them.</p>
<p>However, they seem more irritable, moody, discontent, and mildly aggressive. My place of employment used to be a lighthearted and fun place to work‚Ä¶now it‚Äôs not. Even new people who join the team quit quickly because our place is a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù environment. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve, also, noticed that my friends seem different. </p>
<p>Anyone else notice something similar?</p></p>

        <p>Probably because they know deep down they got duped into an experimental trials with no legal ramifications against the manufacturer while retaining all the potential adverse health complications for themselves.  Adding into some nice propaganda that "doing the right thing" has still led them to a singular point of "wear the mask anyway" because you can still die of Covid.  </p>
<p>If I was that fucking stupid, I'd have alot of internal rage too and rather than critical thinking of WHY im angry (because I lacked it in the first place) I'd turn outward to a segment of the population that I'm being told is causing my misfortune. </p>
<p>This sounds all too familiar... I feel like this happened somewhere in Europe.</p>

        <p>It really isn't hard to draw the same parallels. There's literally a Netflix show on How To Become A Tyrant. First episode is Hitler's rise to power. </p>
<p>Sure, let's be optimistic and assume it will never get to that point again and I truly don't think it will. </p>
<p>BUT what's important is that it can, has, and may. </p>
<p>All we need is a giant economic depression, in which many will be homeless out of a job and starved. </p>
<p>Then giving them something to blame, Delta Variant, and who's attached to it.... The unvaxxed. Voila. </p>
<p>They ran a huge propaganda day on Monday in the US on this exactly.</p>

        <p>Great analysis. Good to have you awake with us here bro ‚úäüèº I've been meaning to check out that series on Netflix. Havent watched much on there, but many shows are definitely directly or indirectly a part of the woke programming agenda. </p>
<p>Let's pray to the divine creator that all these sheep are taken out before it gets to that level, if necessary, so as not to jeopardize everyone else who loves freedom and being left tf alone üôåüèº</p>

        <p>For sure. I do wish ill will to anyone who supports totalitarianism and stealing my inalienable rights. That's not something 1 has the right to be ignorant and supportive of. Sometimes evil people must die, so others can live.</p>
<p>I'm under the hunch that many who took the jab and support authoritarianism, their souls have made a contract to leave this earth.. a karmic reaping so to speak. They're not ready for the new earth of peace that we speak of.</p>
<p>As the Bhagavad Gita states, a wise men does not grieve for the living or for the dead. Never was there a time that you did not exist nor will there come a time when you cease to exist, knowing this how could you ever kill or ever be killed?</p>

        <p>Ooof. That's a rabbits hole all on it's own, lol. There's a book written by Norman Finkelstein that describes that particular narrative of WWII as being a long term psy-opp where the very mentioning of questioning the official narrative results in the same reaction of questioning the covid narrative. Also what's interesting is observing the MSM vilify anyone making comparisons of the two even if you believe the official Holocaust narrative......</p>

<li>17 year old family friend collapsed during the waiting period after her shot. Unclear whether first or second.</li>
<li>Father in law got the shot two months ago. After getting home from second shot, he collapsed in his bathroom. Was found hours later by his wife. He seemed good for a while after that, but he has suddenly become sick now.</li>
<li>My dad got the Pfizer three months ago and was so excited at first. Now he is "tired all the time" and "can't do anything because he runs out of breath." He has since gone on antidepressants. He doesn't call me anymore. When we do talk, it's like he's not there.</li>
<li>My wife's exercise friend got the shot and was sick for a week. She no longer exercises with my wife anymore.</li>
<li>A night-owl coworker got the shot and doesn't understand why she's so tired. Doesn't meet up at night for gaming anymore with her group.</li>
<li>Another coworker became "burned out" after getting the shot. She consulted a doctor and has gone on antianxiety medication.</li>
<li>A dockworkers lives behind my brother-in-law. We see him at backyard parties. I saw him 4 hours after his first shot, and he looked dead. This is a young, fit guy, but he was slumped over and... He just seemed old. He tried to hand something to my bro-in-law and failed. Bro-in-law says, "WTF is wrong with you? Why did you hand it to me like that?" And the guy looked like he was going to cry and said, "I... I don't know man. I just... I'm falling apart." And then left and went back inside.</li>
</ol>
<p>But you know, I'm sure this is all just "anecdotal" and "coincidence." /s</p>
<p>Or, as I've been told before - I'm "making it up for Reddit karma." /s</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. Because Reddit is so important to me, lol.  This dumpster fire of a social network can burn to the ground, good riddance. I do like NNN though.</p>
<p>But not enough to make up side effects stories that aren't even all that "exciting." I mean, these people are all still alive. They just don't seem to be doing real well... :-/</p>
<p>I've never seen people change like this after getting a shot before.</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly! I should add, though, that none of these people will admit that the vaccine has to do anything with it.</p>
<p>Even my father in law says, "Oh it was probably a reaction to the sandwich I ate earlier, maybe it had some bad tuna."</p>
<p>Every one of these people I listed -- except for the dock workers -- is very "pro Covid."</p>
<p>The dock worker is a sad story because he REALLY didn't want to take it, but it was either that or lose his job. And the company gave him 10 days off for taking it, which was a really big deal for him. Getting two weeks PTO when you have a low wage job like that is a big deal. (Which also surprised me because -- I've never heard of companies giving time off at a job for a shot.)</p>
<p>Oh! I should mention that side effects from people at my work were severe enough (people feeling sick/tired/brain fog) after that the company officially gave anyone who gets the shot 2 days off, and they will give more time on a one by one basis if someone reports symptoms to HR.</p>
<p>This is <em>really</em> weird.</p>
<p>Another thing is with the whole lockdown and sending us from home -- our work was the FIRST to know anything... And this was consistent with what we learned from Event 201. In Event 201, the government "communicates through the employer, because the employer is someone they are more likely to trust than the government directly."</p>
<p>So... how much do they know, at the top?  I also know that there are higher ups in the company I'm at that don't want the shot themselves.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I just remembered another employee who has since left --- she had severe brain fog for a week after taking the shot. She just "couldn't think." And this girl was otherwise very healthy and successful. (She's actually semi-famous and has a huge Patreon following.)</p>
<p>So these side effects are real, and they are significant.  And the DENIAL of them, and the CENSORSHIP of them... It's all very suspect.</p>
<p>And then there's the big question we all have... Will there be more longterm side effects?</p>
<p>Here are some notes I took if you care to look up this doctor's interview. He seemed credible to me:</p>
<p>&rt;Dr. Charles Hoffe: MRNA Vaccines ‚ÄòWill Kill Most People‚Äô Through Heart Failure &amp; 62% Already Have Microscopic Blood Clots<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The vast majority of people who are getting injected for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) will die within a few short years from heart failure, warns Dr. Charles Hoffe, M.D., a medical practitioner in British Columbia, Canada.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;‚ÄúSo, when the platelet comes through the capillary it suddenly hits all these COVID spikes and it becomes absolutely inevitable that blood clots will form to block that vessel,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúTherefore, these spike proteins can predictably cause blood clots. They are in your blood vessels (if mRNA ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô) so it is guaranteed.‚Äù<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It turns out that these blood clots are different than the ‚Äúrare‚Äù ones spoken about on the media that show up on CT scans and MRIs. These are microscopic and do not show up on tests, as they can only be detected using a blood test known as D-dimer.</p>
<p>If this is true it's VERY concerning. And the doctor also said the effect is cumulative, so every time you get a shot -- there are MORE clots.</p>
<p>Now think about Canada's plan to have shots every year for the next couple of years followed by two shots the year after that.</p>
<p>WTF are they doing?!  It doesn't make sense that they can "know Covid-19 will continue to be a problem" that long unless they are making it a problem (which obviously is what they are doing.)</p>
<p>But what's going on with these shots?!</p>
<p>And then there's the SPARS Pandemic Scenario document, published in 2017. And if you read that --- yeah there's just no way this is coincidental. No way.</p>
<p>At some point a person is an oblivious fool if they don't heed the warning signs.</p>
<p>Oh, about the doctor that said that -- he didn't say EVERYONE who gets the shots would die in a few years -- that was an exaggerated headline. He said people that exhibit those clotting conditions (62% of his patients) may die in 3 years.</p>
<p>He also said the brain fog, breathing difficulties, and miscellaneous issues were all a result of lots of little small clots happening in the body, and doing damage to organs they settle in.</p>

        <p>That's terrifying. I feel Somene gave me the spike protein as they were around me after the shot. Now I have breathing difficulties. Is this going to end me? Can your doctor say on shedding?</p>

        <p>San Diego, but my dad is in Dallas area.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I don't know if "fucked up" would be the right description. I mean -- it is, but I don't want to oversell it.</p>
<p>Again, none of them are blaming the vaccines (except the short term sickness/brainfog they experienced right after, and the girl that fainted on site. But even she is still very pro-vax and thinks she "just had a reaction.")</p>
<p>But still, it's enough that I don't want it.</p>
<p>I eat healthy, get exercise. I'm not worried about Covid-19, I'm worried about an bio-security authoritarian takeover. I mean --- <em>it's happening.</em></p>

        <p>I would never take this shot but all of my family have. Can't say I've seen any of them change or slow down. Most got it really early and I have a hunch that they got a saline solution instead. Otherwise we'd see the higher number of deaths. </p>
<p>I on the other hand haven't had vivid or its supposed vaccine but feel tired a lot.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs difficult to put into words, but I‚Äôve noticed something different. </p>
<p>Vaccinated people on the whole seem to be more apathetic and tuned out of present awareness, almost like theyre sleepwalking. It‚Äôs not a dramatic difference, but it‚Äôs definitely noticeable. They just dont seem to care as much, aren‚Äôt as invested in life and living...like I said: complete apathy</p>

        <p>I probably would be pretty down too if I believed anything that's in MSM especially after these years of constant propaganda. </p>
<p>What bothers me more is how they can recommend others getting it and in the same sentence complain how they barely can move their arm, not feeling like they haven't woken up from bed since they got the shot, dizzy, watching how someone had to be carried out from the vacc station from an adverse reaction while they where getting it.</p>
<p>All these examples where overheard today lol.. From 4 different people around 20 years old. Imagine the minuscule risk that they'd die from the actual "thing".</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs so weird I was just having this thought when I saw your post pop up. What I was thinking is, is there going to be jealousy from vaccinated people to the unvaccinated people. The Labour Party in the UK is apparently going to oppose the vaccine passport and insist that testing is the method of entry to venues (still not ideal) If this scenario happens will the vaccinated feel jealous that their unvaccinated peers will be able to move through society with the same ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô as them. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if on a subconscious level they know they‚Äôve taken a risk and the mere fact that we exist and won‚Äôt be joining in the experiment fills them with a fear they can‚Äôt understand? Why didn‚Äôt you drink the kool aid!? I drank the kool aid. We will be living examples to them of an alternative route they could have taken.</p>

<p>I fear a <strong>lot</strong> of this is happening. I recently had to fire my sponsor of two years because she just could not let it go that I didn‚Äôt want to be vaccinated. Even went so far as to bemoan about how she cared about my safety and health AFTER previously telling me that Covid was nothing more than the flu.</p>

        <p>I had a customer I've been serving for 8 years look at me and ask how I knew to speak to them in French.</p>
<p>We live in a predominantly English community so when my fellow Francophones come in I speak to them in French.</p>
<p>It seemed like he was looking right through me. Asked how I knew him what my name was and how long is been working there. Again, I've been there for 8 years and am on a first name basis with 95% of the customers. It was scary and sad.</p>
<p>My 2 co-workers have been noticeably different mentally.</p>

        <p>I am concerned for a 41 year old female client of mine.  In one session about a month or so ago she anxiously joked about concerns over being ‚Äúconvinced‚Äù to get the shots.  Last week she was having an existential crisis because for all intents and purposes she is experiencing heart failure.  If she doesn‚Äôt recover, the doctors said she will need a pacemaker.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve noticed that as well. Some people experience a sense of euphoria about being ‚Äúcompletely protected‚Äù by it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve, also, noticed a lot coming to the awareness that the vaccine will only make their symptoms mild and then the deeper sense of awareness that they probably would‚Äôve experienced mild symptoms without the vaccine.</p>

        <p>It's like a religion. Covid is their mad god, the holy science is the holy spirit and the vaccine is their messiah or their second coming. Once they are "saved" it's not enough, they must also "save" all the infidels, by force if necessary. I do not think the injection itself rewires their brain or anything crazy like that, I think the psychological campaign started since well before the vaccine was available has activated a savior complex of sorts in them. "You must be made as holy as I!"</p>

        <p>I don't know if it's related to the vaccine specifically, but when you lock people down, lay them off, close down "things to do" and what not, it's probably going to have a negative effect on their mental health.</p>
<p>The whole political polarization/alienation/propoganda doesn't help either.  </p>
<p>I have had a therapist for several years now, because I suffer from chronic anxiety/depression.  She has said their practice has seen people come back after years of not needing any services.  It's too the point that they are not accepting new patients.</p>

        <p>People I know who had underlying health conditions prior to getting vaccinated seem suddenly to have worsened in only a short period of time. Of course the doctors wouldn't look for obvious correlations in any of those cases. I wonder what the medical staff is thinking. If there truly were no connection, why avoid the necessary tests like the plague, if they are indeed, a statistical possibility.
Ofc the people I talk about suffer a lot of anxiety now, but I think you were asking more about purely psychological changes. Those I have noticed in the last couple of years, but not immediately after vaccination.</p>

        <p>A big part of that is that they‚Äôre covering their asses‚Äîmalpractice suits often allege that some obscure test would have detected the issue, and that a doctor‚Äôs failure to order that test is grounds for a multimillion dollar malpractice settlement.</p>

        <p>I can tell that almost all of the people in my environment changed since covid. I don't think it's the vaccine alone.</p>
<p>The whole fuck is just frustrating and even vaccines don't give the old life back.
We follow the carrots "just one more month" since 1 1/2 years and you can't do a single thing.</p>
<p>Now people I know split apart into vax and non-vax.
The vaxxed are annoying and require anyone to get it and the non-vax turn away from the others bc they are targeted the whole time. It's sad</p>

        <p>This is weird you bring this up. </p>
<p>My 18 year old daughter got vaccinated because she was going on vacation and didn't want to not be able to fly.   Turns out she didn't even need it. </p>
<p>We have been asking her about any odd symptoms, she has seemed ok other than being sick the day after the second shot - but - we were only asking about physical symptoms.  Now that I think about it, her mood has been.. off.  She was always a very "speak her mind" kind of person, and not worried about what others think but she was always a very patient and caring person.  Lately there have been a few times where she has just been extra irritable, and just not herself.  Gets frustrated very easily,  and I guess has a more "angry" vibe. We had just figured it was PMS or something, but it's now been persisting for weeks.  Just a complete change of mood.  Really hope it isn't a permanent thing.</p>
