    <strong>Certification agency in my State threatening to revoke exam if people don't wear mask properly.</strong>
    <p><p>Dear ,  </p>
<p>What we thought would be an  outbreak that would be under control quickly, raged on to become a  pandemic, with the additional complexity now of new variants that are  even more infective.  </p>
<p>While  most certification bodies in North America limited or shut down their  operations, the EOCP has continued providing its stakeholders with all  the services provided prior to the pandemic, albeit with safety  protocols in place, and that is the reason for this email.</p>
<p>A COVID-19 Safety Plan has been developed for the EOCP office, and locations where EOCP staff invigilate exams: </p>
<ol>
<li>Operators are not to attend if they are ill</li>
<li>Physical distancing of 2 metres from Operators and staff </li>
<li>Reduced room capacity so fewer Operators are writing at the same time </li>
<li>Use of hand sanitizer upon entering the facility and when leaving </li>
<li><strong>Wearing a mask that covers both the nose and mouth for the duration of the visit to the exam location</strong> </li>
<li>Avoid touching of eyes, nose, and mouth </li>
<li>Tables, chairs, devices, lockers, and other contact surfaces are sanitized after each exam session </li>
<li>New or sanitized laminated formula sheets are provided </li>
<li>HEPA/UV-C air filters are in use at the EOCP office </li>
<li>One-way traffic flow </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Because  of recent incidents with examinees removing their mask or pushing their  mask below their nose part way through an exam, the EOCP staff team in  future will shut down the exam of any person who does not adhere to this  requirement.  The examinee will then be asked to leave, will be  disqualified from the exam, and will have to wait 30 days to rewrite the  exam.</strong></p>
<p>We recognize that masks  are not comfortable, but know that they are more comfortable than  intubation.  Masks protect you, your fellow examinees, as well as the  EOCP staff.  Please work with us on this.  </p>
<p>Chris Lawrence, Board Chair</p>
<p>Kalpna Solanki, CEO</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The technicians can just tamper the mask and the organization won't know that!</p>
