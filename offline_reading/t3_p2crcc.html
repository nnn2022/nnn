    <strong>Isolation and Dreadfulness</strong>
    <p><p>This whole thing has me so anxious and nervous to how my future will turn out to be. I feel so alone and I don’t know anyone in my age group (18) who hasn’t got the vaccine. The college I was going to go to is requiring it pretty soon and it’s so hard to plan for the future.</p>
<p>My brain is constantly overflowing with thoughts and all I hear is stuff about the vaccine. It’s gotten to the point where I get super nervous whenever I hear the word even if it’s not directed to me.</p>
<p>I live in Cali so most people here would see my problems as irrational and stupid. I used to hate going on this sub Reddit because I dreaded reading about how everything that was shoved in my face is wrong but now I at least know I’m not completely alone but we all know it can’t really replace real life interactions. </p>
<p>My moms partner has considered moving out of state I don’t know to where and if he’s even that serious about it but at this point I’m ready at any moment. It’s so hard to be made out to be the villain by the people I grew up with. </p>
<p>I’m just wondering how do you keep yourself from going insane and not feel super isolated. I know it may vary from state to state but anything helps. Thanks for reading.</p></p>

<p>I'm wondering about that one, too...  </p>
<p>These days the only peace or sanity I get is when I'm asleep --- and alas, I don't get much sleep because I now have tinnitus.  :(  </p>
<p>All I can say is that there are a lot of different people of all ages, walks and backgrounds who are in the same boat as we are.  Things are headed in a bad direction, but there is some push-back.  </p>
<p>Time will tell where all this leads, but nobody is in a good place right now --- especially those who've taken these dodgy injections.</p>

        <p>You have tinnitus as well? I got it back in March 2020 right before lockdown and it was 2 weeks after I got a meningococcal and hpv shot on the same day. Doctors did all kinds of tests and couldn’t find anything wrong and apparently some got it from side effects from the same shots I took. How did you get yours?</p>

        <p>It developed after I moved from a more rural environment to an urban one --- as far as I can tell, it seems to get worse with exposure to microwave radiation (the signals from wireless routers and mobile telephone masts).  I'm stuck in a town now and so I'm submerged in an electromagnetic ocean, therefore there's not much I can do about it...</p>

<p>None of my family are being vaccinated and we plan to resist</p>
<p>I feel alone too as very few people are going to go this far,. I have no peers who are serious about the resistance,. Although I know a few medical staff who say that they are,. I feel that when things get real they will bow to the vaccine </p>

        <p>All this resistance and war stuff makes it sound like Star Wars to me 😂 I don’t know if you’re a fan of that but I am so I had to make the comparison. But yeah I think a lot of the dread comes from the anticipation of something big happening and not being able to do nothing about it. I don’t know if I have much hope anymore but I seriously wish one day it all turns out ok and even then I wouldn’t want to taunt and tease people who got the shot because in reality it’s not their fault. They were just going off the info they were force fed and that was me even just a year ago.</p>

        <p>I have an imperfect situation </p>
<p>You see o grow food keep ducks and live within a few miles of the sea </p>
<p>But if cyber polygon or food shortages or anything of the like was to happen </p>
<p>I'd have a load of " friends " and family and all their friends turn up in need </p>
<p>Also the UK I very very over populated </p>
<p>And there are many large cities within 60 miles of us </p>
<p>66 million on a small island</p>
<p>I am therefore planning to escape to forest plantation for atleast 3 to 4 weeks if all goes to shit </p>
<p>In which time the farm will likely have beenraided for everything of worth </p>
<p>But if I stay there with the fam we will not be able to fight everyone off and most certainly not able to feed all the needie that will show up a d quickly go from " friends" to agressive fast zombies essentially</p>
