    <strong>Telling my family about the NY bill A 416</strong>
    <p><p>I’m sure this has been posted about before, but I saw the NY assembly bill A 416 quite a few months ago that would allow citizens to be taken from their homes and placed in “designated medical facilities” (detention camps?) if they’re accused of being sick. I just unexpectedly came across it again tonight and I casually told my family about it, but they absolutely <em>will not</em> believe it. I shouldn’t be so surprised, but I am. My mother says its fake news. I went to the government site to show her the bill and she won’t trust it. Fake website, fake bill, etc. I said “what more proof do you need than an authentic government site posting this bill??” She said “you never know what’s true or not, its probably fake! Bla bla bla” and it made me so bewildered that even if there isn’t much we can do to substantially stop it, people are vehemently <em>ignoring</em> fascist authoritarianism, even refusing to acknowledge it. Whatever, I guess we can't open their eyes for them. I’ve just lost all hope in the majority of humankind. My own family is now on my ass about “misinformation” even though it is right fucking there. I'm just the joke of the family, the annoying conspiracy theorist. They just say “well <em>we</em> don’t live in NY so we’re not bothered!” Yeah, until it comes to our state, then what? This is sadly the only place I won’t be mocked for challenging and scrutinizing this shitshow. I’m done trying to inform people at this point. Just trying to stay sane, God help us all. Hang in there you guys.</p></p>

        <p>I had a conversation with a doomer several months ago that went like this:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Me: The covid death count is vastly overstated, since they count anyone who dies with covid as a covid death.</p>
<p>Doomer: That's bs. No they don't.</p>
<p>Me: They do. Dr. Birx said as much during a White House press briefing.</p>
<p>Doomer: Yah, no she didn't.</p>
<p>Me: Yes she did. Here's a link to the video.</p>
<p>Doomer: That's taken out of context.</p>
<p>Me: What context is missing? The reporter asks her to clarify how coronavirus deaths are being recorded, and she responds, "if someone dies with covid-19, we are counting that."</p>
<p>Doomer: Dude, she's just another Trump lackey, I don't believe anything she says.</p>
<p>Me: She was hired into her current position by the Obama administration.</p>
<p>Doomer: Yeah but now she works for Trump so she's become another Trump lackey.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>People see what they want to see.</p>

        <p>Here is what I learned from this scam:</p>
<ul>
<li>People will believe everything the media tells them (see toilet paper fiasco)</li>
<li>People will ask their overlords how high they should jump when their overlords ask them to jump (see mask mandates)</li>
<li>People have lost their critical thinking skills and have not bothered to question what they're being told (see Kary Mullis on PCR)</li>
<li>People will do everything they're told just to keep in the good graces of their overlords (see pro-maskers attacking people not wearing masks) </li>
<li>People are acting like the Germans did when the NAZIS took power (see Karens acting like the mask gestapo)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I can go and on, but the people you have engaged (e.g., person you encountered above), clearly can not think for themselves because they allowed the media to think for them.</p>
<p>Isn't it interesting that since the SCAM, er, I mean pandemic started, people have mysteriously lost their critical thinking, logical deductive reasoning and analysis skills? May be that is the virus, the loss of critical thinking, logical deductive reasoning and analysis skills!</p>

        <p>This is exactly why nobody believes ANY of the truth... Because it's all so horrible and they're very scared, (and no offense to your mom, cuz my family is same way) frankly dumb little sheep-people. They are cognitively blocking out the uncomfortable truths because they need to, to cope. They would break, and break down, if they allowed themselves to accept even a fraction of how enslaved and duped they are, and how evil their captors and dupers really are.</p>

        <p>I get the same reaction. I’ve also noted how if it is in one state it’s likely not too far behind in others.  Also mention history repeating itself with specific examples.  Unfortunately, it will not bother someone unless it happens to them or someone they know.  They sure won’t hear about this on the news.</p>

        <p>If I WERE to tell my family my opinions they would respond the same way, so I just don't. When they get Bell's Palsy, die from the vaccine, or get put into camps themselves then they just might. I'll let them figure it out. smile, nodd and walk away is my way of conversing with them, but I've had 4 years of practice so I'm used to it by now.</p>
