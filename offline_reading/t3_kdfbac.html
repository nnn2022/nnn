        <p>This jumps out at me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Thanks to everybody that didn't follow the rules because you went to Zuckerberg University. You made a beautiful woman uglycry tonight.</p>
<p>Why does he believe that things would be different if people were to follow the rules? It doesn't matter the compliance to all social distancing, masks and lockdown orders and the virus would still "out there".</p>
<p>I see it all the time. We'd go back into lockdown again and people would get upset "at all the partiers and people flaunting the rules and not social distancing. They're ruining it for everyone and drawing the pandemic out!"</p>
<p>The original point of the lockdowns, in fact, was to lengthen the pandemic. It wasn't to stop anyone from getting sick ever, because that is an impossibility; it was to 'flatten the curve' and stop ICU's from being overwhelmed by everyone getting sick at once. As soon as the curve is flattened and everyone is allowed some social mobility again, cases will rise. It's inevitable.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*As an aside: the fact that "two weeks to flatten the curve" has become "month 10 of the pandemic and here's some more lockdowns" is a big part of why I'm suspicious of government intentions. The goalposts keep changing and shifting to ever more impossible standards and no one seems to care.</p>

        <p>I'm wondering if the reason that the standards are ever shifting is because they found some huge long term side effect of having CoVid-19.</p>
<p>I'm talking sterilization equivalent to mumps. If they found that... for frick's sake... just come out and say that is extant! That would actually be something to worry about!</p>

        <p>My problem with the people not listening to the rules stated by the government, <em>is</em> your point exactly. It was to flatten the curve, to not let the virus gain traction, which was exactly what happened over the last couple months. Because people didn't follow the rules, a hard lockdown had to be enforced, to flatten it out again so the hospitals and caretakers can manage the worst cases.</p>

        <p>I am tired, so it's possible I misread your comment.   </p>
<p>I can't really speak to how things went down in your area. In my experience, we started locking shit down early to flatten the curve, and largely succeeded. The problem is that they didn't give breathing room after things improved. They aren't short term, quick and hard lockdowns to slow spread - they're long, grinding, and don't let up enough when things improve. As they wear on, losses become permanent, and people's good will ebbs away.   </p>
<p>Even if we agree that a hard lockdown is needed to flatten the curve in the first place, it doesn't change the fact that the reasons and rhetoric lately has shifted over time. We stopped talking about flattening the curve and started talking about locking down to reduce death rates. We stopped talking about death rates and now we talk about cases rates instead - because those are currently taking off and death rates are staying stable (at least in my area). Vax's being the light at the end of the tunnel has shifted to "you'll need to keep doing what you're doing after the vax."</p>
