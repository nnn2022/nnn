        <p>Just stating the obvious:</p>
<p>Since "having to take a vaccine in order to return to normal" in itself is not "normal", that argument is not convincing.</p>
<p>That train of thought in OPs title sets an incredibly dangerous precedent, where over the years, eg every 2-5 years, more and more experimental meds could be used to remove and give rights to citizens as wished, which is one of the worst dystopias imaginable.</p>
<p>Also important:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are other ways to deal with Covid-19 than with masks, school closures and experimental mRNA-injections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covid-19 in itself is far from "damaging enough" to even begin this train of thought</p>

        <p>George Washington literally required his troops to get inoculated and we all know what a tyranical dictator he was. forcing more and more medical experiments on his soldiers until they hulked out and tore the British to pieces. Expecting you to not be a selfish piece of shit is not the same as a dystopia. Also I never said anything about requiring you to get a vaccine, I just said that you should.  Think before you type</p>
<p>Also over 600k people have died of covid in the US. More than any war besides the civil war (depending on how you want to count it, the civil war could go either way) and it did that while basically shutting society down, so it is bad enough</p>

        <p>Now now, i won't get into your demeaning emotional way of communicating,</p>
<p>but indeed Washington forced vaccines, for a certain illness that was deadly for a very very large percentage of the infected. At least if i am informed correctly.</p>
<p>If Super-Ebola was sweeping the world right now with 20% IFR, i would be the first to hide in my basement until a vaccine is out that sorta increases survival chances - and go get that vaccine. I aint stupid. Covid is in a very very different ballpark is all im saying.</p>

        <p>I was specifically referring to the US, which was hit much harder than many other first world countries (which that study admits it mainly looks at). being hit harder drives up death rates due to lack of hospital availability. Which of course has also caused people that don't have covid to die due to lack of space. There's also the fact that this study looks at deaths reported as covid fatalities, and during most epidemics/pandemics, especially with a new disease, numbers tend to be under reported</p>

        <p>The US, until recently, has used PCR tests at 40+ cycles to diagnose. There is a nonzero # of false positives at that level. That number does also not distinguish between dying from vs dying with COVID. Average age of person dying is higher than the average life expectancy. That number also does not take into account all the people who got COVID but were never tested for it. </p>
<p>The number 1.6 % is not accurate...it is inflated. By how much? We don’t know. The gov’t and alphabet soup organizations have lied throughout his fiasco.</p>

<p>600k people have died with a +PCR test on file. Also even if it is real a virus it is not an enemy soldier, it is a part of nature. More people have died from any number of things than our biggest wars.</p>

        <p>We are trying to protect large portions of the population…. from total tyrannical government control, and not this exaggerated virus. What part of this person’s “science” supports the fact that masks and vaccines protect a “large portion of the population”? The PCR tests that this same person most likely followed were based entirely on poor data and fake science.</p>

Vaccinated individuals have a 99.999% survival rate, unvaccinated are 25x more likely to die, or 99.975% chance of surviving. If that’s not blatant exaggeration by using different formats of numbers to confuse the public, I don’t know how to convince you what is. This supports my argument of it being exaggerated.</p>
<p>My source for the actual science of this claim will come from the official <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home">CDC website.</a></p>
<p><strong>Cases Total</strong> 35,991,203</p>
<p><strong>Deaths Total</strong> 615,778</p>
<p><strong>US Population</strong> ~330M</p>
<p>Do the math and you’ll see that the virus has roughly an 11% infection rate in the US, and a 1.71% death rate in those infected in the US. Not to mention most of the people dying are either obese, elderly, or already critically ill from an underlying condition. Why ruin the lives of so many people and steal the youth’s youth just so already-dying people can get a few more knocks in at deaths door?</p>

        <p>You are asking for data. Here is the deal. For every single argument you put up with a scientific paper and  link there will be someone on here with a counter argument and a scientific paper. Your job is easier as everything we put forward has been censored and pushed under ground because of the press and politics.  </p>
<p>Just one question. Why!  Ask why. Question everything you know and believe before questioning others, because we are being lied too. There is a deliberate push to have the general population at each others throat, to hide the fact that we are all being screwed. Pick the subject. Politics/ religion/ sexuality/ race/ covid/ and right now, this vax. </p>
<p>And yes, we probably are putting the vaxxed at risk by being asymtomatic, because that demographic happens to be the one to be at risk from dying from the delta varient (per UK stats) but we are not to blame for their deaths. That lies on the shoulders of political puppets forcing the vaxx on everyone and by suppressing alternate treatments.</p>
