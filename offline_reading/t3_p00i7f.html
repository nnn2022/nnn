    <strong>Crying wolf was one of the earliest lessons we learned as children.</strong>
    <p><p>Every child alive has embellished a story or two in order to get what we want.  If it works the first time, 100% we do it again.  Once our parents catch on to our antics, they tell us about the boy who cried wolf.</p>
<p>Aside from the moral, ethical, and legal missteps this whole situation has caused, it’s possible we haven’t even seen the detriment it’s truly going to cause.</p>
<p>Anyone that has taken a basic statistics course can tell you the virus and it’s mortality rate aren’t something that needs the response it has gotten.</p>
<p>Eventually even the people that made their entire identity about wearing a mask and getting the jab will see through the bull shit.  Eventually it will become impossible to continue the charades.</p>
<p>What I fear is an actual virus or bacteria that has a much high mortality rate, perhaps spreading even faster, coming along down the road.</p>
<p>Covid will have made all of us skeptics. </p>
<p>Covid will cry wolf until we no longer give a fuck, just in time for something real to come along, and all these stupid ass protocols that don’t work anyway will be what we use for the real deal, and I think we can all agree, that would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>A real virus will feast on us just like the wolves.</p>
<p>Anyway…. Have a nice weekend you guys!</p></p>
