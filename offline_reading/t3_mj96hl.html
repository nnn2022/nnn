        <p>Covid-19 Quiz: Which of these statements is/are false?
1. On October 18, 2019, one month before the reported outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, China, there was a simulation called Event 201, simulating a worldwide coronavirus pandemic, and it took place the exact same day the Military World Games began in Wuhan, China. Furthermore, the participants of the simulation, including Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Johns Hopkins, as well as others, are now financially benefiting from the pandemic.
2. Kary Mullis, the inventor of the PCR test that is being used to diagnose coronavirus cases, died August 7, 2019, shortly before the coronavirus outbreak, and prior to his death had stated that Anthony Fauci was a liar, a fraud, and the face of agendas, who was misusing his PCR test to falsely diagnosis cases of disease and illness. He also challenged Fauci to a debate, which Fauci ignored.
3. Anthony Fauci said at Georgetown, in Washington D.C., the nation's first Jesuit university, on January 10, 2017, there would be a surprise outbreak and pandemic in the time of the Donald Trump administration, ten days before Donald Trump took office.
4. California Governor Newsom said in March of 2020, as he locked down his state, that in 8 weeks (56 days), 56% of California would get 'coronavirus', a very specific prediction, with two uses of the number 56 --- which matters because in Gematria, the practice of coding numbers into words, all of the following equate to 56 --- coronavirus, covid vaccine, Anthony Fauci, Gavin Newsom, Washington D.C., Society of Jesus (Both Newsom and Fauci are Jesuit educated), mind control, all seeing eye, unemployment, toilet paper (think about it).
5. 56 year old Boris Johnson read a 56 page “winter plan” for coronavirus in 2020, before announcing the new and more infections U.K. Strain, which was reported to be 56% more infectious, before locking down England on remember, remember the 5th of November, Guy Fawkes the Jesuit Day, the day leaving 56 days in the year.
6. Pope Francis, the first Jesuit Pope, wrote 'Fratelli Tutti', a name equating to 56 in Gematria terms, his encyclical about what to do about 'coronavirus', as well as 'climate change', the latter also equating to 56, reminding that Francis is similar to France, where the Jesuits were created, and more specifically 'Paris, France', also equating to 56, which is the home of the “Paris Climate Accords.”
7. Pope Francis was born 'Jorge Mario Bergoglio', equating to 201, the same as 'Ignatius of Loyola', the founder of 'The Jesuit Order', a name also equating to 201, and he is the first Pope to live at Suite 201 in the Vatican, known as the 'Domus Sanctae Marthae', also equating to 201. ***Again, Event 201 was the name of the coronavirus outbreak sim.
8. Mainstream media has actively been reporting cold and flu cases are down 98%, while coronavirus cases (which are very similar), are way up.</p>

        <p>So they've changed the Event 201 website. It used to have a PDF of the scenario where it stated the model pandemic began as coronavirus in bats that moved to humans. Now it says it began in pig farms in Brazil. PLEASE tell me someone else out there has seen that document, or was smart enough to save it!</p>
