    <p><p>Someone please tell me I'm not alone in foreseeing our inevitable outcome. </p>
<p>The same NWO that has been openly advocated for decades has been recently rebranded as "The Great Reset." With the echoing phrase "Build Back Better" being touted by the G7 leaders, it's quite obvious of the mutual plans. Don't overlook it for what it will truly be, a One World Government. </p>
<p>If that is too hard for you to grasp, you are ~~no different~~ worse than those who dismissed Noah and his warning. Because unlike having to rely on hearsay from a stranger, we actually have legitimate proof. It's as simple as flipping over your US dollar bill and studying the latin &amp; esoteric/satanic symbolism. Divulge into the history of the Federal Reserve, more importantly the Rothschilds and how they obtained power/control of entire countries through deceit. Educate yourself of the philosophy pushed by the Rockefeller's specifically their dominance over people scenario "Operation Lockstep" (<a href="https://archive.org/details/rockefeller-foundation-operation-lockstep/Rockefeller%20Foundation%20Operation%20Lockstep">https://archive.org/details/rockefeller-foundation-operation-lockstep/Rockefeller%20Foundation%20Operation%20Lockstep</a>)</p>
<p>It greatly troubles me how people without any justification reject the idea a billionaire, such as Bill Gates could have wicked motives/agendas. They ignore the fact his experimental vaccine caused paralysis in over 450,000 Indians, caused polio outbreaks in Africa and Afghanistan, who's father created Planned Parenthood, who openly preaches for population control and even allows his ex or soon to be, to wear an upside-down crucifix on national Tv. </p>
<p>For Pete's sake, don't be naive to the influence and control these people have. "Those who have the gold make the rules."</p>
<p>Let's wrap it up---</p>

<p>The scariest part (IMO), integrate technology with biology/human beings. </p>

<p><strong>Revelation 13:16 "</strong>It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, <strong>17</strong> so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.</p>
<p><strong>18</strong> This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666." </p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the technology and doubt its capabilities, I'll gladly link all of the info/research I have, as per request. For starters look into DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Agency)</p>
<p>Perhaps, more people will critically weigh the benefits of incorporating technology into their <strong>temple</strong>. </p>
<p>Crash/Reset the economy, transition to a new currency (crypto) that also relies on the same technology that is being coerced unto the masses. </p>

<p>Adopt the Mark of the Beast "WO-2020/0<strong>6</strong>0<strong>6</strong>0<strong>6</strong>": <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020060606">https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020060606</a></p>
<p>Now you can "freely" travel with the new benefits of not having to touch yucky germ infested screens at airports: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/travel-reopen-touchless-vaccine-passports-1.6061433">https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/travel-reopen-touchless-vaccine-passports-1.6061433</a></p>
<p>Just scan your wrist and go, unless you don't have a ‘<strong>Luciferase</strong>’ branding, then I'm afraid you cannot leave your "district."</p>

<p>You can't deny the fact this mRNA tech is being heavily forced/advertised for what statistics show to be for a minor threat to certain ages/health. You've got to ask &amp; wonder why. Why do they want us to adopt this foreign control over our bodies? This shit isn't normal people. Please wake up. To clarify, I'm not saying this specific 'medical treatment' is the beast itself, I'm suggesting the same technology is the transition and introduction of it.</p></p>
