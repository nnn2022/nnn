    <strong>Clown world, everywhere</strong>
    <p><p>I can't even go to a fucking brewery and enjoy a beer OUTDOORS without having to participate in covid theater.</p>
<p>You thought the "mask-on when not at your table" restaurant rule was bad? Listen to this.</p>
<p>Here, you're sitting <em>out-fucking-side</em> and you have to order your beer on the website with a QR code, otherwise the server doesn't even come to you. When the server comes over - in a mask <em>and gloves</em> - you must also put your mask on. 🤡</p>
<p>I didn't realize this was a rule until I saw that the the server with the beers was standing away from our table and looking at me. My friends told me to put my mask on because otherwise they can't come by the table.</p>
<p>I almost lost my shit. I put the mask on because otherwise I wouldn't get the beer I already paid for, but suffice it to say that I didn't order another one and I will never be back there.</p>
<p>This is in a state that has <strong>50 "positive cases" per 1 million people</strong>.  That's a positivity rate of 0.003% and these CLOWNS are literally creating theater <em>outside in fresh air</em> and refusing to even fucking bring my beer over because I am not wearing a mask. Note: ALL official restrictions were lifted last month. But businesses are free to enforce what they want. But this behavior is bonkers.</p>
<p>This is a fucking cult. I try really had to be empathetic but when people are this robotic it's honestly hard to relate to them on any human level. I cannot imagine what its like to be so brain washed that you will not put a beer on a fucking table unless a person sitting a meter away from you is wearing a piece of useless cloth over their mouth. How did we get to this idiocy?! </p>
<p>Thanks for listening to my rant. Apart from one of my friends and my family, you guys are really the only one to understand how this feels. I don't even want to tell my family this stuff anymore because its fucking depressing. The businesses in these blue state that put up this clown show are absolutely guilty of perpetuating this theater and I have no idea how to combat it except abstain from eating or drinking almost anywhere. Basically stop participating in society except the essentials like work and food shopping and things that don't require fucking mask/vaccine/virtue signal theater. And then get out of this blue clown state if I can.</p></p>

        <p>My friend took me to a pub last week (UK) As we walked in the owner asked my friend if she had a mask. My friend replied she doesnt wear a mask. For some reason the owner didnt even ask me but she made her contempt for both of us really obvious. She then showed us to our table and we had to walk past all these other customers who were already seated, without masks. They nearly all glared at us. That's the first time I've been in a pub since xmas day and the comedy is off the charts. They all somehow believe that the breath coming out of your mouth is safe, just as long as you're sitting down, but the minute you stand up the deadly covid breath starts infecting everyone. The other dumb thing was, the owner puts this qr code thing down on the table and says 'you have to check in' so as she turned around, I put my hand over it and said 'beep' lol</p>

        <p>Yeah the UK theatre surrounding all of these restrictions is currently pretty silly. I've started to only comply if explicitly asked to, so that people can get more and more used to seeing others behaving sensibly and maybe do the same.</p>

        <p>It is because polarization, because the level of division of our society. It is not fear anymore. It is not to be prudent. It is not because someone ordered. No. </p>
<p>It is all to sustain a narrative. People are ignoring information, labeling other people as enemies given their opinions. We are back to the tribe wars. But now an individual have several “mini-tribes” to defend, consuming all his/her mind to fit the reality in their narrow horizon. </p>
<p>And we aren’t safe from that critic. We started to see rivals everywhere too. And it seems impossible to settle our differences now. </p>

        <p>I agree, it's indoctrination. After I saw the Instagram of that brewery it turns out they are super woke. So that sort of checks out. But people who know this stuff is bullshit and comply are part of the problem. The friends I was with think it's BS for the most part but they were obediently going along with the orders because "it's the rule". When I asked what the science was behind putting a piece of cloth over your face when the server comes over, they said " don't question it".</p>

        <p>In other countries you also have to show a daily updated negative corona test and if possible the vaccination status. All on top of the masks</p>

        <p>kinda your fault for going there.  </p>
<p>personally, i wont be going anywhere until everything is completely back to normal.  for the same reason you wrote this post, it hurts my mental health and I cannot ignore the stupidity of it all.  </p>
<p>i only frequent a local vape shop that is owned by someone who sees through this so i can feel normal in there.  </p>
<p>why subject yourself to this clown show if you dont have to?</p>

        <p>Like I said, I had no idea that this place had these idiotic rules. I walked up to the table without a mask and no one said anything, so I assumed they were chill (I was wrong). Not only until I actually made the order did I find out I was wrong :)</p>
