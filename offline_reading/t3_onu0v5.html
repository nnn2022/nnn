<title>57 year old Iraqi mother in Sydney who died of "COVID" in fact died of a heart attack shortly after receiving the vaccine (which she likely took due to media and political pressure on her sons for "spreading the Delta strain"). Media still calling it a COVID death.</title>

        <p>That' s the fucked up thing we need to battle now.</p>
<p>They will try to classify those who die <em>because of the experimental jab</em> <strong>as</strong> "covid virus" deaths.</p>
<p>The only way to know if someone died like they said "of covid", it to check that person if they had the vax. If they had the vax the correlation it's clear.  To hide the correlation, they employ in the same tactic as last year by mislabeling the deaths. They will just assume the vax was safe and scapegoat on other causes.</p>
<p>Same story we've seen when the pandemic started - they classified <em>anyone</em> with <strong>existing</strong> heart, diabetes, pulmonary, etc <strong>fatal disease</strong> <em>as if the covid caused that death - when in fact they didn't even know the severity of the "covid virus" -</em> <strong><em>they only assumed it's severe and based on that assumption they turned the world upside down - by releasing global regulation and starting the propaganda machine 24/7.</em></strong></p>
<p>For anyone wondering how the pandemic started with the wrong classification as "covid" cause of death, check the WHO official document in my last post.</p>
<p>Same will happen now if we don't ring the bell loud enough and actually call them from the beginning, the whole pandemic was based on false assumptions.</p>
<p>There is no time to fear the labels friends.üôè</p>
