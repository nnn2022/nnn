    <strong>A Disheartening Day in My Little Town</strong>
    <p><p>Throughout this total absurdity, and  even on the worst days when the world appeared hopelessly brainwashed, I was always able to seek solace by just merely going for a walk where I would see people in my community behaving rationally and relatively normal. Having this to lea on was very comforting and allowed me to maintain my composure, transcending the madness. But, on my daily walk with my dog as I was passing through the beachfront I noticed a fairly large gathering of people on a hillside. As I began my approach, i realized that the group of people were all mothers and at the core was a gathering of children all dancing and singing to background music. For a fleeting moment, my spirits jumped and i could feel the warming of my heart as the smile widened across my face, but upon closer inspection I began to realize that all these people were masked, even the children...It was obvious, they were putting on a virtue signal performance that they were video taping which I am absolutely certain will begin to circulate on local facebook accounts...In a heartbeat I went from being the most inspired that I've been in a long time to a sensation of total disgust. Of course, dogs are a children's delight so on my way past the children's attention was distracted and all you could here was the clear commands to turn their attention back towards to "coordinator"... Since most of the mothers were gathered on a public walkway, i made my way through them, kind of hoping someone would comment but they refrained, so I just continued my course without making eye contact. Honestly all I could think was if someone addressed me my only word would be "I would gladly die from COVID if it meant your children could live a free life without being bombarded by irrational fear at every turn"</p>
<p>We are at the end of March 2021 and to see this in a town that has seemingly maintained it's sanity throughout this ordeal becoming a part of the narrative is appalling. I cannot believe that mother's of all people would subject their children to this life altering abuse. On a side note, there were some onlookers at a distance, including some with children who were not masked so they all got a big smile as I passed by them lol...</p></p>

        <p>Should of recorded some of it to show that it was clearly a publicity stunt. It helps to be able to see the director the DP, and cameras.</p>

        <p>WTF people ?   Thanks to your idiotic thinking, we are STILL dealing with this pandemic and cases are going back UP.    Stop thinking only about yourself - think about the people who have died and WILL DIE as a result of your ignorance and stupidity.   You really look like a bunch of fools, carrying on with this riduculous bs.   Our beloved country needs you to WAKE UP and do the right thing.</p>

        <p>Let me be as blunt as possible. I don't care about your healthcare. I don't care about cases. I will go on carrying on with the old normal, as we've been doing in Florida for 9 months. And you'll continue do nothing about it. Because you can't.</p>
