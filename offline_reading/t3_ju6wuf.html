        <p>The welfare state supporters are fighting against charter schools- Thomas Sowell</p>
<p>The base of the welfare state party is blacks, the highest group of supporters for them are black people, who vote at majority democrat... That same left then fights to destroy their education, the only good thing going on for them in education is charter schools.</p>
<p>It goes back to the Homeless Industrial Complex, where they need the problem to always exist and keep growing so they can keep on getting billions of dollars in funding to "fight" homeless. This is the same concept with blacks, the democratic party has to keep them uneducated and poor, so they keep voting for the welfare state. They are incentivized in the destruction of their voting base, just to keep them voting for them.</p>
<p>Evil evil stuff the left and the welfare state do to people... Too bad some are too dumb to connect the dots until it's too late. If the deep state and the socialist rig the elections and biden wins, get ready for hell on earth America. It's gonna be a long 4 years for you guys.</p>
