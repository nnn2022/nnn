    <strong>Am I alone?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a reasonably social adult. In 18 months of a global pandemic I directly know less than 5 people who has been infected with covid. None of those had more than a 2 day cold.</p>
<p>However I'd estimate that about 30-40% of my friends and work colleagues who have been vaccinated have complained about the after effects or had to take time off work.</p></p>

        <p>Lol, yes, I have seen many videos of empty emergency rooms &amp; empty hospitals  &amp; empty hospital parking lots. From uk, Canada,  usa, Germany. They've been deleted from YouTube &amp; fb. In the uk, they arrested ppl for posting the videos. I think a guy filming in Canada was also arrested</p>

        <p>There are 337 million people in the US, give or take.     There have been about 600 thousand deaths directly attributed directly to or comorbid with SARS. Think about the ratio of population to deaths there. I know exactly one person who passed away from COVID and no other morbidity was involved. I know of about twenty people, give or take, who had the virus, isolated and recovered without medical treatment. 
 We have county and state health officials, employees in place to take cadavers to morgues and funeral homes, cremation centers so they are not left "outside". 
 The hospitals in our area were absolutely packed, at one time, with COVID patients. The second and third waves here were minimal and the medical techniques were better. Infected are kept in rooms, not in the lobby, which may be why you can't walk in and see them drowning in their own fluids at the end of their lives. If you wanted to see them the staff wouldn't be able let you up there under any circumstances. 
 I'm glad you haven't lost anyone and haven't had to listen to what the disease does to the people it kills, it's heart rendering. Stay safe.</p>

        <p>Fuckin' right. My teenage daughter had to be hospitalized after a suicide attempt due to severe depression (direct result of the lockdowns). They tried their best to give me as many hoops as possible to jump through in order to even visit her. But I got through soon enough.  </p>
<p>Hospital was a fucking ghost town. No panic, no chaos, no bodies piled on top of each other. Nurses doing their usual shit - standing around chatting with each other, pretending to look busy, sitting at reception desks doing fuck all. She was there for three weeks. I visited her as much as possible (at least once each day). There were supposedly two COVID patients in the ICU during that time. In a city of 230,000 people. Sure, not the biggest city by any stretch, but plenty big enough.  </p>
<p>Absolutely ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Same. I have a large circle of friends. No one ever caught covid. Also, I know many people who got vaxxed both at work, my relatives and close family members. Most co-workers got very bad reactions and were out for days. My evil bosses who got vaxxed said they had no adverse reactions, not even a sore arm. My relatives and close family members who got vaxxed only had sore arms. So I suspect some placebos are given out.</p>

        <p>If I didn’t live on a college campus, we’d be in the same boat. At work the only people who still wear masks are the vaccinated ones and they hall have symptoms for 2 weeks plus, meanwhile everybody I’ve known that’s gotten sick (and that’s a lot because of the campus thing) recover in a few days.
