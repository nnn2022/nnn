    <strong>I've been thinking: Did most people actually live before all this?</strong>
    <p><p>It's summer, so obviously the rules are a little bit less strict. I've come to notice that most people are not concerned with losing their freedom, but with not being able to go to a bar or a restaurant. When that was allowed again, everything was fine for most people.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder... did people actually live before all of this? The ancient Romans knew it already... bread and games. Give the people enough food and something to take their attention (professional sports for many), and people mostly won't rebel.</p>
<p>It's ridiculous...</p></p>

        <p>I'm an introvert I was mostly "locked down" voluntarily before the coof.  About the only difference these days is that I have things delivered instead of going to get them.</p>
<p>For me personally this has been an amazing year.  My profession has gone full time remote now so I will never have to go into an office again.  I bought a new house too.</p>
<p>My friends are introverted too and we hang out in each other's places or online.</p>

        <p>I work as a server at a restaurant that for a time was asking to see proof of vacation or mask up. The vast, vast majority of boomers had no problem with this. They happily showed their card or put on a mask. But tell them the wait will be long to get their food because three people were out sick today, or they can't add chicken to their iceberg lettuce salad, or that we don't have appetizers tonight because we are so low on staff??? Geez, they all loose their minds or walk out fuming and ranting about how this is an economic collapse, young people not wanting to work is the real crisis, etc. My conclusion is that people want to be served more than they want real freedom and wellbeing. It didn't matter to them before COVID that the entire restaurant industry is built on excess and waste, and mostly below poverty line pay. And it doesn't matter to them now that getting served means the people serving them are coerced into taking a pharmaceutical product they don't want. Screw this BS, I don't want the old normal any more than the new normal.</p>

        <p>Idc about restaurants, bars, movie theaters and so on. I just hate the constant vaccine in your face. I’m fine with just parks, cooking at home, I have my home, college online so nothing really changed in terms of restrictions lockdown.</p>

        <p>I did all kinds of stuff, all the time, in the past. This covid nonsense has made me way more introverted though. Not because I’m afraid of the virus but I feel mentally broken and hardly trust anyone except my partner and immediate family</p>

        <p>I guess it depends on what you call 'living' &amp; what you call 'freedom'. I called living &amp; freedom being able to travel, to go to concerts, bars, or every other business I could think of. For those inclined, even to church. </p>
<p>What does "living" &amp; "freedom" mean to you?</p>
