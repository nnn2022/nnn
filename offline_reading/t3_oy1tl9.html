    <strong>Do you actually know anybody who's died of COVID?</strong>
    <p><p>Or even anybody who's gotten seriously sick from COVID?  </p>
<p>I know  two people who had asymptomatic cases, but that's it for me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I doubt I'd even know COVID existed if COVID wasn't all over the news and people weren't wearing masks. (Even the people I know who had asymptomatic cases probably wouldn't have gotten tested in the first place if COVID wasn't such a media obsession.)</p></p>

        <p>My grandpa died with it.  He was 88 and had collapsed lung in his 60s and failing health. It was heart breaking but not surprising at all.  </p>
<p>My grandma with dementia had it and beat it. I joke that she just forgot she had it. </p>
<p>My mom had it. It roughed her up good but she beat it.  </p>
<p>The entire time my uncle was watching over them. He has fucked up lungs from the navy and smokes.  He was around them non stop for 3 weeks and never caught it.</p>
<p>This first hand experience along with data is why  I reject the new normal and anyone who promotes it. I will never get the shot and will fight for my rights.</p>

        <p>Yes, 2 people’s deaths labeled COVID.  Both over 65.  One had been critically ill the year before, I hate to say it, he was walking on borrowed time.  The 2nd was a close friend and as far as I know, perfectly fine until Covid.  I was shocked by his death.
Another friend, age 62, him and his wife both caught it. He ended up in ER, lost bunch of weight, he said it was the sickest he’s ever been, but his wife barely had a reaction.<br>
On the other hand, most I’ve know that caught it, quickly recovered .   98% of people I know were over it in 3-4 days.<br>
It’s a very confusing thing. I’ve know situations where someone had it, were at a party and literally no one caught it from them, no masks worn.<br>
I had a client in my office 2 weeks ago that notified  me they tested positive, I didn’t catch it.
I don’t think Covid is a joke, people do die from it (not as many as they say), but I am firmly against the jab/lockdowns/etc.  I have more faith in my own immune system than I do a rushed out gene manipulator.  I’m against the government forcing these things on people; thereby ruining their businesses, mental health and potentially long-term health.  That is not normal.</p>

        <p>Could it have been the flu in some cases as is coming out now that the pcr test can not distinguish between flu and covid ? I saw a video of a guy stating that the us had a bad flu epidemic in jan/feb 2020 (if I remember correctly).</p>

        <p>The difference is, people die with covid and not off of covid.
Many died off underlaying issues, which normally would die anyway.</p>
<p>But it's easier for the governments to label them as covid deaths, cuz, you know, the narrative.</p>

        <p>I know quite a few people that died "with COVID". Every single one was a resident of the nursing home I used to work at, and every single one was older than 70 and had multiple chronic illnesses. Most of these people had one foot in the grave already when I last worked there, a full year before the plandemic happened. Don't let anyone gaslight you into thinking that COVID-19 is a reason for young and healthy people to shut down their entire lives for.</p>

        <p>I personally know nobody who has died from covid. I only personally know one person who was hospitalized, but it was for pneumonia that she got after getting covid and she is obese. I also know of, not personally know, one person who was in the hospital for 6 weeks on a vent (the teller at my mom's bank, my mom talked to her, I didn't). I personally know a lot of people, including obese and vulnerable people, who got covid and were fine.</p>

        <p>1 of my coworkers was renting rooms out, another coworker and his gf stayed with him (total of 5 people there), those two went for dinner with a cousin, the pregnant GF tested positive but I guess felt fine besides headaches, only got tested because the cousin told them to after he tested positive, they all quarantined but nobody else tested positive </p>
<p>My elderly next door neighbor both husband and wife caught it from their grandkid, they looked like death but both pulled through </p>
<p>A bunch of us at work all got really sick Jan 2020 too but there was no tests yet, I’m almost positive it was Covid as I do remember not having taste on top of other flu like symptoms but my boyfriend who lives with me never got it from me </p>
<p>2 other people said they had it near the very beginning </p>
<p>I think that’s only people I personally know that actually said anything, but no deaths </p>
<p>And it’s like all my coworkers talk about and none of them know of any deaths either and very little positive cases</p>

Neither my dad n'or her kids could see her and all I can think of is how her last days went. Terrified in a hospital where she already doesn't know one day from the next, and no family or friends around.</p>

<p>1 said it was the worse thing ever, though he doesn't look worse for the wear.  He is also very overweight.</p>
<p>1 didn't know he had it except a test said so.  Still doesn't think he had it.  Nothing happened.</p>
<p>1 woman didn't know she had it except for a test.  Nothing happened.</p>
<p>None died.  The woman is like 60 something.</p>
<p>I also know of nobody who has had side effects of shots.  Granted, I don't run around asking who has but assume everyone at work around me has.  I could be very wrong.</p>
<p>Having said that, we had two out of the office today due to sinus/allergy issues.  I tend to agree that's what it is.</p>

<p>Not in my immediate family but in my extended family there were a few cases.  All mild with the required quarantines.  Same deal at work mostly but some middle aged guy in another department died from it they said.  I don't know his case history at all (co-morbidities etc.).</p>

        <p>My grandma died with it (she was in her nineties and had dementia/Alzheimer’s). </p>
<p>My cousin got roughed up. She still has trouble walking. Maybe in her fifties, heavy and a smoker. (Not saying she deserved it or anything like that, just trying to give context).</p>

        <p>I know of one person who got incredibly sick and almost died. </p>
<p>Dude is in his 60s and (at least) 200 lbs overweight and could barely walk better than a shuffle before catching Rona. </p>
<p>Took him months of recovery but still pulled through. Solid Pandemic eh?</p>
