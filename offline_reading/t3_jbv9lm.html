    <strong>I'm doing a project on government control and Covid19 and I want to use this sub. I am required to get demographic data. If you feel comfortable, answer as many as you'd like.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm using the posts in this sub for a project on government control. It's for a statistics class and so I need demographic data.</p>
<p>If everyone could share a few details about themselves that'd be great as it'd help me raise awareness on this troubling issue. </p>
<p>Answer as many as you'd like. I'd use a poll but it's disabled. </p>
<p>Demographic data:</p>
<p>What country and state are you a resident in?</p>
<p>How old are you?</p>
<p>What is your sex?</p>
<p>What is your race?</p>
<p>Opinion and extra info about your thoughts:</p>
<p>What political side are you more in support of? (Democrat or Republican)</p>
<p>Do you support the current president?</p>
<p>Do you believe the government is brainwashing people?</p>
<p>Is Covid19 a hoax?</p>
<p>Is Covid19 something that should be paid 0 attention to?</p>
<p>Feel free to add anything else but I'd prefer it if everything is kept rather short and to the point as I will need to read all of the replies. Yes No and single word answers are appreciated where appropriate. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p></p>

        <p>I said answer all which you feel comfortable with. Aka don't answer any if you don't want to and don't answer all if you don't want to. What else should I ask instead? I need a demographic to include in my project. If you don't know who my demographic is I can't even put any of the good info of this sub in my project.</p>

        <p>Yea I know it is which is why I'm saying they can if they <em>want</em> to. No one is forcing them. If they * would like to* answer some I'd be happy to read them and use the general data to plot out some graphs, pin point a few places on a map, and present the info from the sub with the demographics.</p>

        <p>&rt;What country and state are you a resident in?</p>
<p>Norway.</p>
<p>&rt;How old are you?</p>
<p>20 y/o.</p>
<p>&rt;What is your sex?</p>
<p>Female.</p>
<p>&rt;What is your race?</p>
<p>Why does it matter?</p>
<p>&rt;Opinion and extra info about your thoughts:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;What political side are you more in support of? (Democrat or Republican)</p>
<p>Neither. I'm normally a social democrat and leaning to Bernie Sanders. I don't like the democrat or republican. Neither have good solution on healthcare and education imho. I'm more unhappy with the democrat's view on lockdown since it's not helping poor people.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you support the current president?</p>
<p>I'm not American and I don't support Donald Trump normally. I still think the lockdown hurt the economy, mental health and many young people's lives.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you believe the government is brainwashing people?</p>
<p>I think most of the governments around the world got no clue and don't see the long term consequences. They can only see short term and ignores flaws. I don't think most governments are consciously trying to do mistakes, but a few does. Dictatorships in many 3rd world countries for example does it for control. The government in my country and neighbor countries are probably just clueless. I don't think they've bad intentions.</p>
<p>&rt;Is Covid19 a hoax?</p>
<p>The virus is real. It's similar to a flu, but with a different name, different cause and different appearance (has crowns). It's not as deadly or dangerous as first thought. Media blown it out of proportions.</p>
<p>&rt;Is Covid19 something that should be paid 0 attention to?</p>
<p>COVID19 should be treated like any other flu. Vaccines should be voluntarily, normal hand hygiene is good enough, cough in the elbow or in a tissue and stay at home if sick. Apart from that commoners should be allowed to live normal lives with as few restrictions as possible. Hospital staff should off course follow strict hygiene rules, but they've to do it regardless if COVID19 exist or not because of other injuries and illnesses patients have.</p>

<p>Male</p>
<p>&rt;What is your race?</p>

<p>&rt;Opinion and extra info about your thoughts:</p>
<p>You're not asking the right questions below.</p>
<p>&rt;What political side are you more in support of? (Democrat or Republican)</p>
<p>No.  The bipolar political system is killing this country.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you support the current president?</p>
<p>No, and I won't after he wins re-election either.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you believe the government is brainwashing people?</p>
<p>Lol no.  But the Healthcare Sector and all who derive profit off it are, as is the main stream media.  The government is BEING brainwashed.</p>
<p>&rt;Is Covid19 a hoax?</p>
<p>No, but the response <strong>dramatically</strong> fails to incorporate hardly any scientific knowledge we've accumulated over thousands of years.</p>
<p>&rt;Is Covid19 something that should be paid 0 attention to?</p>
<p>No. It should be a wake-up call to everybody that they need to start getting good healthy amounts of all the nutrients the immune system requires to function properly.</p>
<p>&rt;How do you feel about masks? Do you think they work?</p>
<p>ALL talk about masks is for preventing discussion and mind share of the more important question of: what can people do to be more healthy.</p>
<p>&rt;How do you feel about the virus and government as a whole?</p>
<p>Obviously all governments care about power and Doctrine, not health.  Nutrition is the foundation of health, and people don't get enough.</p>

        <p>&rt;What country and state are you a resident in?
US, OR </p>
<p>&rt;How old are you?
Middle millennial </p>
<p>&rt;What is your sex?
Female </p>
<p>&rt;What political side are you more in support of? (Democrat or Republican)
Neither, I am not registered to any party. I am to the left of Bernie Sanders</p>
<p>&rt;Do you support the current president?
No, not a Trump supporter</p>
<p>&rt;Is Covid19 a hoax?
No, the virus is real, and some people have died from its complications. The reaction to the virus is massively overblown, however. </p>
<p>&rt;Is Covid19 something that should be paid 0 attention to?
Not <em>zero</em>, no. I guess we should pay about as much attention to it as we pay attention to the flu during flu seasons. </p>
<p>&rt;How do you feel about masks? Do you think they work?
No I don't think they work really. Maybe a little. The data doesn't support this idea that 100% of the population should be wearing masks every time they go out in public, even if they aren't sick. Asymptomatic cases aren't the main driver of spread, for one. Masks have a lot of negative side effects too - it's a huge impedance to normal communication since we can't see facial expressions. It's dehumanizing to have everyone masked and I've noticed people are ruder to each other as a result - we can't see disarming smiles. It's a disaster for hard of hearing people who need to read lips to parse what someone is saying. Also, some people simply cannot wear masks for legitimate medical reasons (PTSD, asthma, etc.) and these people are being completely dismissed and harassed. It's horrific and ableist. </p>
<p>&rt;How do you feel about the virus and government as a whole?
Vague question, but the government response has been a disaster that has destroyed many businesses, and for what? Was it even effective? Nope.</p>

<p>Also I asked for sex not gender. I don't believe in more than two genders and the questions I am supposed to ask don't ask for more than two options for sex.</p>

        <p>I am only including demographic data here that I have already shared in other posts.</p>
<p>What country and state are you a resident in? California, USA</p>
<p>What is your sex? F</p>
<p>What political side are you more in support of? (Democrat or Republican) Prior to lockdowns, Democrat. Now I despise both parties. </p>
<p>Do you support the current president? No</p>
<p>Do you believe the government is brainwashing people? The media is, via constant fear porn and ritualistic shaming of anyone who dares to go out and socialize. </p>
<p>Is Covid19 a hoax? No, and I'm sick of "researchers" asking this meaningless question. You might as well ask if we "believe in science" while you're at it.</p>
<p>Is Covid19 something that should be paid 0 attention to? Not zero: about as much attention as is typically paid to seasonal flu, as others have said.</p>
<p>How do you feel about masks? Do you think they work? https://aapsonline.org/mask-facts/</p>
<p>How do you feel about the virus and government as a whole? It's being used as the excuse for massive power grabs in the form of surveillance and intrusive policing. Like the "war on terror", but 100000x. </p>
<p>Other thoughts: there needs to be a reckoning where those who imposed lockdowns, and the media who did constant social distancing shaming and silenced dissident views, are publicly held to account for the enormous human costs of the lockdowns. Everything from mass starvation of the global poor, to increases in suicides and drug overdoses ("deaths of despair"), to neglect of other health treatment such as cancer treatment, to the loss of our civil rights.</p>

- Germany</p>
<p>How old are you?
- 39</p>
<p>What is your sex?
A bit irregular at the moment.</p>
<p>What is your race?
Caucasian</p>
<p>Opinion and extra info about your thoughts:</p>
<p>What political side are you more in support of? (Democrat or Republican)
Neither</p>
<p>Do you support the current president?
Yes (The one of the US?)</p>
<p>Do you believe the government is brainwashing people?
Yes. (They generally don't mind)</p>
<p>Is Covid19 a hoax?
Yes.</p>
<p>Is Covid19 something that should be paid 0 attention to?
Yes.</p>
<p>How do you feel about masks? Do you think they work?
Insane. </p>
<p>How do you feel about the virus and government as a whole?
Well, the countries of the world took the loans, austerity is coming. Look at who controls the big banks who will profit (aside from Bezos and the likes). Apart from this, the president of Burundi exposed the hoax and quickly died and Lukashenko who said he didn't care about Covid got a Maidan. Even Putin didn't dare stand up against the international banking mafia. Make ur own conclusions.</p>

        <p>Country/State: Texas, USA</p>
<p>Age: 21</p>
<p>Sex: Male</p>
<p>Race: White</p>
<p>Political Alignment: Republican, somewhat libertarian </p>
<p>Do I support the president: Yes</p>
<p>Do I think COVID-19 is a hoax? The virus itself, no. The severity of it, yes. </p>
<p>Do I think COVID-19 is worth no attention? No, it's still a serious illness, and needs to be dealt with. </p>
<p>What do I think of masks? I believe they're causing more harm than good. People being forced to wear them will do the bare minimum to get by, but not enough to use masks correctly.</p>
<p>Do masks work? They can work, but it would require everyone care to wear medical grade masks correctly, which as I mentioned in the previous response, won't happen.</p>
<p>Thoughts on the virus and the government: if the government acquiesces to impose unreasonable, non-scientific restrictions out of an unfounded societal fear, then it is not to be trusted.</p>
<p>Other thoughts: I'm an atheist, having left a religious cult about 2 years ago. The beliefs of people who favor lockdowns and mask mandates don't know just how cultish they're acting, and is one of the many reasons I cannot support those views.</p>
