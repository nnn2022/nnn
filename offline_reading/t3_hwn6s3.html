    <strong>Working Together to the Bring the Facts Out (Xpost from r/lockdownskepticism)</strong>
    <p><p>In 1800, Wordsworth, commenting on modernity’s mental impoverishment, said, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rt;“For a multitude of causes, unknown to former times, are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of the mind, and, unfitting it for all voluntary exertion, to reduce it to a state of almost savage mental torpor. The most effective of these causes are the great national events which are daily taking place, <strong>and the increasing accumulation of men in cities, where the uniformity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident, which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies</strong>.” </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was largely of the same opinion in February. It seems like westerners were so bored with antiseptic mundanity that they relished the excitement of an encroaching boogeyman. People may as well have been licking their chops. This was irritating but tolerable until life began to be suspended, and that suspension was protracted… again… and again… and again. Invasive ordinances began to increase in severity – measures that not only have no basis in epidemiological precedence or present data, they fly in the face of all previous pandemic response guidelines. Media gaslighting, flagrant data manipulation, questionable iatrogenic responses, etc., etc.; you all know the story.  On top of that, we’re projecting unconscionable global tragedies: over a million children dying worldwide, collapse of economies in the global south, and countless deaths of despair. To date, we’ve already estimated 600,000 - 900,000 new cancers have gone undetected in America. All for a virus that, as far the data shows, we wouldn’t have even noticed if we didn’t look for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sub, among other recessed pockets of the net, have been one of the few glimmers of hope in world increasingly benighted by its own self-congratulating, alacritous hysteria. The best thing about it is we’re a motley crew. Lockdown skepticism is a pied piper: people of all stripes color the concept (I’ve even seen a controversial mini-celebrity I follow commenting on here lol). And just like the pied piper led the rats of plague out of Hamelin, I think a cooperative, proactive strategy from lockdown skeptics can get this sham of pandemic out of our world and our lives back to normal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe this is already going on and I’m out of the loop, but maybe there are other people out of the loop. In any case, I think if a number of us are vocal about their specialties and skills, we can develop tactics to 1) collate and collect discrete strata of info, 2) saturate the public sphere with these actual facts, and 3) approach local and state/province/region governments with data, as well as information on how to generate legitimate models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, as far as 1 goes, I know we have the resource page on the megathread sticky, but maybe we can do different things for media issues/epidemiology/stats. Maybe some users have been paying close attention to the media, so together they can put together a well-evidenced chronology of media gaslighting and revisionism. Maybe they can categorize it according to figures, governments, or institutions: e.g. a chronology of Fauci’s backpedaling, Cuomo’s policies, the Sweden ‘debate,’ masks, etc. Other users maybe have been following the math. Others the science. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On point 2, there’s evidence that around 200,000 twitter bots were used to encourage lockdown across the world. Even now, on YouTube and on Reddit, you can see users that are clearly paid (some that are clearly bots) commenting aggressively on videos/posts that cast doubt on the accepted COVID narrative or running games like, “why can’t you just wear a mask.” I don’t know if people want to go that route – if ethics prohibit imitating that tactic – but at least we can see that prolific repetition of messages across these media have significant impact. Maybe there’s some users who have skills in these areas that can . Similarly, users with backgrounds in production, entertainment, etc. could be working together to throw up content. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for point 3, obviously relying on governments is a bit dubious at this point. Nevertheless, it’s important that the facts are actually brought to them. I don’t think it’s at all a far-fetched assumption to guess that the majority of legislatures are merely acting on the information presented in the news. If they’re prevented with real data and research rather than the manhandled excuse for epidemiology curves the media touts, then they have the option to change their mind. To that end, it’s also a propitious strategy to approach universities. Titles have power. Getting PhDs on board will go a long way to ending this. Encourage academics to assess the data and they may also engage with governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are all just ambitious examples of things that can be done. Obviously, we may just go on dissenting in our individual way, privately or publicly, and that’s fine. The main point is that we must intrepidly champion the facts. Don’t let the aggression of ideologues cow you into comprising truth. If they flame at a collocation of “covid” and “flu,” let them self-immolate. Most of us have vacillated throughout this ordeal, following the research as it developed. Now, the data is in. There is no more debate about what’s been going on, only obfuscation of facts. Most of all, we must not allow them to rewrite history and spin this into them being the heroes. That is nothing short of an invitation for remorseless authoritarianism.</p>
