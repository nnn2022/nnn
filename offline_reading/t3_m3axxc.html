        <p>I would just be a troll on that sub since I see it as futile to convince  them otherwise. I would even go so far as to title it in a way that appears to use the article as support for lockdowns just to see if people agree with me... but what good would that do, besides give cheap entertainment and confirm what I already kind of maybe know...</p>

        <p>The author is trying to redefine "pandemic" by asserting that it must have a certain age distribution of the dead because historically there was a trend in age differences.</p>
<p>I like that he linked to the WHO definition which was also changed. It used to be any worldwide spread of a disease, not just a new one.</p>
<p>Edit: They don't seem to be taking into account advances in medicine. :-/</p>

        <p>Yes, and by any definition and measure, the case and death numbers are similar irregardless of restrictions and lockdowns (as well as suspected incentivized over reporting deaths  w COVID as the primary cause...) thus leading to lockdown skepticism. 
Which is why it is futile to try to convince lockdown supporters, because if it isnâ€™t obvious then why argue with stupid...</p>

        <p>But I also try to see a silver lining in everything and in my opinion it was an unprecedented experience. One that in my opinion failed, but an experience to learn from nonetheless.</p>
