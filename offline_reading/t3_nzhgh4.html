        <p>Obviously you don’t know how the virus works. When you get infected you have (up to) two weeks before you start to show symptoms. In those two weeks you can infect other people, also some people are asymptotic, never showing symptoms but can also spread it.</p>
<p>COVID has a 2% mortality rate, it would probably be a lot higher if we flooded the hospitals if we didn’t do anything, but an argument could be made that the majority of the deaths are from old people and people with weak immune systems. That boils down the COVID death rate for young, healthy people to around 0.03%. People on this sub are saying that the COVID vaccine death rate is too high for them to take it, but the vaccine death rate (if we count any death after taking the vaccine a vaccine death, no matter how unrelated) is ~0.0017%. That tells me that either people are lying (or have an flawed reason) on why they don’t want to take the vaccine, or people do think that the COVID death rate is in fact too high for comfort.</p>

        <p>the death rate is not 2% the numbers are inflated. But for the sake of the argument I’ll go with 2%. the death rate would be a lot lower if we used ivermectin, HCQ and budesonide and advertise/give out vitamin D and other supplements. Here are some prevention measures that should of been discussed/advertised. </p>
<p>Suggesting to people that working out at home and losing weight during this 14 month lockdown would reduce the numbers. Considering the fact that 78% of those who were hospitalized are obese. You can lose a lot of weight in that time. They should of had enough data within 3-6 months to start suggesting this. When they had this data they started offering cheeseburgers, fries, beer, donuts etc. Sure that won’t make people fat right away but, the point is they’re giving you something unhealthy when a lot of the deaths are related to obesity. Doesn’t really help with the vaccine “hesitancy” people have. </p>
<p>Informing the public that 95% of the deaths had an average of 3 or more comorbidities. List the exact comorbidities that covid patients are more vulnerable too. Those people should be advised to wear n95, face shield and goggles. They redesigned factories to manufacture ventilators. im sure they could make n95’s for those suffering from comorbidities. Advise those same
People to order groceries online and to remain home. </p>
<p>Also your argument saying that we need to quarantine because of asymptotic people isn’t logical. People with the vaccine can still be a  carrier. Although they have less chance of death compared to those who by now have chose not to get it they’re still considered a asymptotic spreaders just like the unvaccinated. You now have a bunch of people who can still spread it vaccinated or not, only difference is the unvaccinated are facing the 0.03% chance of death which is on them. They’re in no way increasing the chance for those vaccinated to get sick. Vaccine does not reduce the spread, only the symptoms. </p>
<p>People don’t want to get the vaccine because it does not have long term data. The animal trials were not successful for covid-19. We are the human trials. mRNA has been around for a couple decades but, they have never created a successful mRNA vaccine that has been used for the general public. We simply do not know the long term side effects, that is a fact. Especially if we are going to be needing boosters from all these variants they’re talking about. I have a family friend who was hospital a few days after her vaccine from paralyzation From the waist down. She managed to walk again after help from a rehabilitation program. I know it’s extremely rare case, but people suspect that they’re not reporting the adverse reactions accurately because their reporting systems are overwhelmed. We also have censorship from doctors speaking out, that is another huge red flag. The point is people will take the extremely small risk of dying from covid than this vaccine. Especially if you’ve already had covid! They say x amount of covid cases, well how many cases are there? we are walking around asymptotic does that not mean we would technically count as a confirmed case if we got tested? Overall the way this pandemic has been handled has been nothing but sloppy. We have failed to distribute accurate information accordingly which has caused distrust between the government and the public.</p>

        <p>But there are asymptomatic cases, that's why the quarantine was put into effect worldwide. It's estimated that as many as 80% of people who catch covid are asymptomatic, and they would never know they were infectious unless they tested constantly. </p>
<p>Those mandates aren't meant to threaten healthy people, it's to keep people who are likely infectious but are unaware of it at home.</p>

        <p>But being asymptomatic is the problem. It's not about people surviving without having symptoms, it's about the people they unknowingly spread it to who might end up in the hospital because of it. That's been the big issue and why quarantine was put into place, because it's very contagious and you don't know if you're spreading it to others. </p>
<p>How many more millions of people need to die for you to consider covid as deadly? Shouldn't the fact that it kills/leaves it's survivors with lifelong health problems enough to consider it a threat? Do you just want to keep extending quarantine and have more people end up dead because you don't want to take a vaccine that has led to zero deaths?</p>

        <p>An asymptomatic person spreading covid to five people still leads to one person in the hospital. And those people who are asymptomatic could each spread it to another five people, leading to more people being hospitalized and dying. Without quarantine and masks, covid would have been even worse than what it already was. </p>
<p>I don't have to pick one or the other, because it's a fact that most people who caught covid won't end up in the hospital. But it's also a fact that it kills people and leaves it's survivors with life long health complications in the brain, heart, and lungs. </p>
<p>It doesn't have to be a "massive killer" to be deadly, because the fact that it kills anyone at all is enough for me to want to prevent the spread of covid. Just because most people won't die from it doesn't mean that it hasn't killed mothers, fathers, siblings, friends, sons, or daughters. And it will continue to do so until herd immunity is reached.</p>

        <p>You don't even believe that people can spread a disease, so why are you arguing with me? Do you think that you'll convince me that people can't spread disease if they aren't coughing or sneezing? What do you mean by a factor of five? The fact that covid is spread is still the issue, not that only a minority of people end up in the hospital. </p>
<p>The true solution to stop quarantine and mask mandates is for herd immunity through vaccination, but you're probably going to tell me that the vaccines are unsafe and infringing on your freedoms.</p>

        <p>What does that have to do with anything? A low death rate still means that people are dying, why wouldn't you want to reduce the spread of a disease that could kill the people around you, even if that chance was less than 2%?</p>

        <p>Do you mask up and close down your business every flu season just to reduce the spread of the disease? According to you it’s important to stop the spread even if it’s less than 2%</p>

        <p>No, because flu isn't spread through air particles it's spread through contact and fluids. Which is why people get vaccinated annually for it, wash their hands, sneeze into their elbows, and sanitize door knobs. The chance of spreading covid isn't less than 2%, that's the death rate for people who catch covid.</p>

        <p>But the virus has an incubation time where you are symptomless and can spread it. Or you might never develop symptoms and are still infectious. And I’m not using my 10 combined PTO and sick days to stay home from work when sick. Those are for my well deserved vacation. Hope they thought of a way to prevent those scenarios.</p>

<p>Most of the people here agree with staying home if you are sick. I really don’t think there are many of any people that sick people walking around. The issue most here have is simply that lockdowns shut down the economy.</p>

        <p>That little piece of cloth has been shown in lab experiments to drastically reduce the number of airborne water droplets that get ejected after a sneeze/ cough or even while talking. It is believed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is uniquely transmitted through these droplets, and does not just float around in the air on its own. That’s why masks help reduce transmission.</p>
