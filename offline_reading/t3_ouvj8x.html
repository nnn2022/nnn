    <strong>Thank the heckin' Lord that we're technologically advanced enough as a species to be able to limit all social contact, work from home and track who's "got" the virus!! LIFE WITHOUT NETFLIX WOULD SUCK SO BAD, YOU GUYS!! OMG! #DeepThoughts</strong>
    <p><p>I was just having another one of my many #DeepThoughts on the toilet and you guys... we're SO LUCKY we are so technologically advanced as a species that we can sit at home and have all our favourite movies and tv shows streamed onto our teles, do all our important office work from our cramped little box rooms and communicate over Zoom calls, otherwise this pandemic just wouldn't work!! OMG imagine though, spending over a year locked inside WITHOUT NETFLIX. I can't even!</p>
<p>Also it's super conveniant that we have apps on our phones that can tell us if we've possibly come into contact with someone who's had the virus!! Like, imagine how difficult it would be to keep track of all the people who might have the virus if we didn't have those apps, you guys!! We'd possibly have to return to normal life or something, who knows!! How scary is that, you guys!? Also if we didn't have QR code scanners on our phone we couldn't do track and trace or any of that handy surveillance shit!! OMG THE HORROR.</p>
<p>Thankfully our benevolent technocratic overlords can monitor the spread of the virus through our phones and feed us ~~propaganda~~ news 24/7 via the internet, Facebook and our insatiable media consuming culture!! This will make it so much easier for them to make everything digital and remove the threat of real life from real life!! Let's face it, we're in need of a good RESET. Maybe even a GREAT one. People just need to stay inside from now on, because we can.</p>
<p>I've just finished my giant poo (I always do my best thinking when I'm squeezing out an arse-shredding log the size of a caterpillar cake, I don't know about the rest of you) and my chocolate starfish has been splashed by the toilet water, alleviating the sting a little. I don't know why I'm telling you this but I couldn't think of a better way to end my post. Hope you all enjoyed my #DeepThought for the day. Byeeeee.</p></p>
