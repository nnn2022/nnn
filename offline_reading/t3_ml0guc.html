    <strong>Why do people say fuck the police and want healthcare reform and know that the government is corrupt then turn around and yell at people for not placing their lives in the government’s hands with covid?</strong>
    <p><p>The same people who see what the government does and say fuck the police and that we need healthcare reform and KNOW that the government is corrupted will turn around and cancel you for not trusting it when it comes to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Do you think they all suddenly became extremely unselfish, saint people just because there’s a pandemic? Why would you think for a second that they aren’t using this pandemic and milking it for money and power?</p>
<p>Why do you not see the connection? What makes it different in a pandemic? Why do you blindly trust a system that is failing everyone so horrifically?</p></p>

        <p>At its' core, it's a distinct lack of self-confidence which they try to improve by seeking validation from others. </p>
<p>They do so by outwardly projecting whatever the perceived "safe" opinion is at the time, in the hopes that other people will subtly pick up on it and think "what a nice person." North America doesn't have a social credit score because we don't really need one; it's already taken care of at a subconscious level.</p>
<p>In short they are grinding out trace amounts of social credit; IE virtue signalling. They don't actually care for the stance itself or that it may appear comically hypocritical when compared with other stances they've taken, only how it may potentially make others perceive them in that fleeting moment. And they'll just do it over and over again for every little issue that comes up.</p>
<p>This was around long before covid and it'll be around after as well.</p>
<p>I vehemently point to Kony 2012 as the start of all this.</p>

        <p>Spring of 2012 there was this super high production quality video that went viral across Facebook saying some warlord in Africa (Joseph Kony) was kidnapping children and recruiting them for his child army, and they needed YOUR donations.</p>
<p>It was only a year or two after I graduated HS so all of the classmates I still had added who were directionless or just struggling to "find themselves" began aggressively sharing the clip. If you commented something like <em>"why does this affect me?"</em>, these people whom you otherwise were on good terms with and remembered quite fondly from high school, would jump down your throat or accuse you of being racist. It basically split your graduating class into two groups: <strong>cultists</strong>, and <strong>people who wondered WTF was going on and found the whole thing laughable</strong>.</p>
<p>Each viral social issue from that point on, was a repeat of Kony2012. Little by little you'd watch a portion of your Facebook feed - at this point in time largely classmates or people you knew from organized sports - go completely insane over something that didn't even affect them.</p>

        <p>This is why we need free markets. Humans are inherently selfish. This fact cannot be changed. The ability to breath, eat food, defend yourself, make a living, take care of your friends and family is all born out of selfishishness.</p>
<p>You can either deny human nature and build a socialist society, or accept it and build a free-market capitalist society. You can have a mix too. You can get away with denying it for a long time, but it eventually catches up to you once the economy collapses and people lose their homes and are starving. The irony is that socialist states always collapse because of selfishness, but mankind seems hellbent on repeating history.</p>
<p>People only support the police/state when they think it benefits them. Most people never break free from the duopoly.</p>

        <p>yeah i think that makes sense. If you have more government regulations theres gonna be people abusing that power.</p>
<p>On the other hand if companies can go unchecked and get monopolies and arent stopped from trying to control the government, thats another issue.</p>

        <p>This is the problem there's no balancing act because the people paid to balance are corrupt. Take the ACA for example it was allegedly supposed to help people get affordable healthcare. There were no checks on the insurance companies so the public got fucked into a giant tax. It wasn't reform it was more money stolen from the people. Then people call for universal healthcare like those same government leeches are really going to give you good access to care. Come the fuck on. Everything that's done in healthcare is to profit. They are not trying to heal or care for anyone. <em>15 years in healthcare and I want to die</em></p>

        <p>I'm from Chicago and all I will say is that the Chicago Police is corrupt as h#ll. They are racist also but that's side point. On the other side, the CPD has, rarely, enforced any covid bullshit.</p>

        <p>Exact same groups of people say the same thing.  “Government is corrupt!  Healthcare reform! Why won’t they cancel student debt?!?” And in the same breath, “government needs to mandate masks forever!  They need to defund police!!”</p>
<p>It’s just mentally exhausting.  My theory?  This group of people don’t have enough REAL, PERSONAL problems to deal with, like, paying for their own health insurance, paying for their own cars and wireless bills, figuring out how to start and maintain a meaningful career, so on.  Most of the loudest crowd are self-proclaimed activists, and have too little to actually worry about.</p>
