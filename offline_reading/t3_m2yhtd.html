    <strong>Haven't seen my boyfriend in months</strong>
    <p><p>My boyfriend is British, I'm German. Last time I got to see him was November. It is currently illegal to travel from Britain at all, and if I were to travel there (I can't because relationships are nOt EsSeNtIaL like yeah, tell that to my fucking depression lol I need a goddamn hug more than anything) I'd have to pay upward of 200 £ for a testing kit on top of the 200€ to fly at all.</p>
<p>I'm so fucking done. My mental health is in shambles. At what point is it enough? At what point is it over? Are we just going to do this every fucking year now during flu season? I don't want to fucking live anymore. Uni is impossible for me via distance. My father might lose his job. I lost my first job. I hate the governments so goddamn much.</p></p>
