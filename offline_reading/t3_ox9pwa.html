    <strong>Post vax miscarriage and cancer</strong>
    <p><p>I had brunch with some college friends. </p>
<p>One was saying that her sister got the vax in February and was diagnosed with breast cancer in March, and the doctor was saying that something in the vax (she said, but I can't remember what) triggered the cancer to grow. She's been in chemo for the last six months and scheduled for a mastectomy this week. </p>
<p>My other friend said that her coworker got the vax and had a miscarriage two days later.</p></p>

        <p>Obstetricians are both offering it and encouraging it in cases.  Also, getting the TDAP during pregnancy is considered a very good idea (and has years and years of evidence to back it up).  I’ve had the TDAP during both my pregnancies and had absolutely no adverse affects.  My doctor asked me at each appointment if I wanted the Covid shot (I gave birth in the middle of March) but each time I said “not at this time.” She dropped it after she asked the question I assumed she was mandated to ask.  <em>My</em> doctor wasn’t pushy.  But I’m sure there are plenty of young moms out there who trust their OB (why wouldn’t they??) and those OBs are abusing that trust by pushing this EUA “vaccine.”  They’re getting bad medical advice.</p>

        <p>If she’s getting chemo before a mastectomy(this is called neoadjuvant therapy) then the tumor would have been fairly large at the time of diagnosis and they are using chemo to shrink it prior to surgery. Even if this was a very fast growing tumor, it would have started long before she got the vax. Simply put, breast cancer doesn’t grow fast enough for the cancer to have started in February when she received the covid vaccine.</p>

        <p>What OP said was something in the vaccine trigger the cancer to grow. We all have a “healthy” amount of cancer In our bodies some growing at an extremely slow rate and some possibly growing at a faster rate. He is saying that something inside the vaccine triggered the cancer or reacted with the cancer and caused it to start growing (obviously at a much faster rate). Just being the devils advocate</p>

        <p>You’re right in that our immune systems are constantly fending off threats such as roque cells that could develop into solid tumors. However, if the vaccine triggered these cells to grow faster, it would still be at the microscopic level when she got the vaccine. Even fast growing tumors only double in size every 30 days or so. Patients typically have tumors measuring in centimeters when this type of treatment strategy is used.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure about the logistics or specifics on this, I know as much as you but that sounds like a fair point and argument and I appreciate your reply. This is how I learn, when someone actually replies with a viable fact based argument I grow as a person. So I appreciate that. I hope you have a wonderful day.</p>

        <p>FWIW, my friend (despite both her and her sister testing negative for the breast cancer gene) has an insane family history of breast cancer - her mother, grandmother, all aunts, a cousin (I think?), and her other sister have all had breast cancer. My friend has had screenings every year for almost a decade. It's entirely probably the tumor already existed and the vax simply aggravated it.</p>

        <p>Oh wow. That’s terrible. We still have a lot to unravel about cancer. Makes you wonder if there’s other genes related to it that just haven’t been identified yet. </p>
<p>It sounds like the Dr believes she still in the curable window. Best wishes to your friend.</p>

        <p>The chemo shrank it enough that they can't find any evidence on scans; it's because of her family history, they are just doing the mastectomy to be safe. The prognosis is really good (thank God!).</p>
