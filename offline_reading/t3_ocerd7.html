        <p>Pure Keto is nonsense.  Pure Vegan is nonsense.  Pure Carnivore is nonsense.</p>
<p>We have been omnivores for all of history.</p>
<p>Traditional diets are what you need.  Eat what your ancestors ate when they lived off the land.  Seafood, butter, meat, plants, grains- it doesn't matter.  There is no homogeneous human diet.  The expression of your genes is determined by food, and the genes you have were shaped over centuries of locally available nutrients.</p>
<p>People with dark skin don't absorb Vitamin D3 as well, so they need more sunlight each day.  Very few of us of any skin color get enough.</p>
<p>America is very different than the rest of the world because very few of us have any level of access to our personal traditional foods, in great part because of the lack of genetic homogeneity.  This is not bad in principle, obviously it's wonderful that people from different backgrounds find love and community together, but the dietary and lifestyle needs of a child born of Korean and Nigerian parents or a child born of Norwegian and Aboriginal Australian parents are drastically different than either of their individual parents and nowhere close to the bleached wheat/refined sugar/low fat/low vitamin/soy diets that are offered to us at every corner of every street.</p>
<p>Combined with unsustainable farming practices that strip the soil of nutrients, excessive pesticide use, and breeding for bland vegetables and sugary fruits, we have lost 80-90% of vitamin content in many common produce items.</p>
<p>Getting real food in America is hard.  And our diversity is wonderful, but it produces dietary challenges that our medical and food establishment has chosen to ignore.</p>

        <p>That isn't my point, though I agree with most of what you said. Most people will sell their birthright for a bowl of soup. That's all I'm saying.</p>

        <p>&rt; Although I will say that at no point in history until recently have our ancestors ever eaten, or even been capable of eating, seed oils like are being fed.</p>
<p>Linseed oil has been used as a food ingredient for centuries in central europe. The oldest operating mill I know of was built in 1650, but there are manual mills much older than that. It was used to help conserve dairy products by floating it on their surface and was mixed into things like quark to improve taste.</p>
<p>Olive oil has been produced and consumed in large amounts since at least 8000 years ago across the mediterranean basin.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are other examples, but these two are the oldest I could think of.</p>

        <p>Totally yes. I'm talking crisco. Flax is wonderful, olive oil is great, coconut oil is great.</p>
<p>Vegetable oil is actually inedible seed oil and it's poisonous. They call it vegetable but it should have never been called this.</p>

        <p>1650 is a relatively short time ago compared to 8000 years. But anyway what you say and the comment you reply to aren't mutually exclusive. We have consumed certain vegetable oils for a long time but not to the same degree. We certainly haven't been using a lot of the mechanically recovered oils we now see in our food for a particularly long time.</p>

        <p>This was a very interesting, well written post.</p>
<p>I was reading a journal in a trade magazine the other day that talked about how in under 100 years time, supposedly 'soil erosion' will have rendered much of our farmland inadequate for growing crops.</p>
<p>Just an anecdote and I have not looked into it particularly, but interesting none the less.</p>

        <p>No point in checking, since you can just vomit up any poisons, amiright? Just like the "vaccine". If it hurts you, just fuckin puke it out! C'mon, guys... Not that hard. </p>
<p>Ohh, what? It's injected and I can't puke it up? That's ok. That just means they're extra-certain that it won't hurt me. There's no way that the experts would give me something they're not 100% sure is safe. </p>
<p>That's why, when they told me I could take oxycontin as a non-addictive alternative to morphine for my pain, I believed them. And ya know what? It works so well that after 20 years I'm STILL on it! </p>

        <p>I was thinking the same thing. I will definitely try to use this. </p>
<p>If someone asks me "Have you had the vaccine" I just offer them some random vitamin pills I pull out from my pocked and say "do you want to take one of these really quick?" </p>
<p>If they decline, I will just reply "fucking anti-med clown!".</p>

        <p>I've tried the food analogy. I get a lot of "obesity only effects the individual!!" and get stuck in that loop despite the fact that we're now expected to take an experimental jab to protect those people.</p>
<p>Before some idiot comes in with "bUt grandma!" : I had 6 elderly family members get covid and survive without any ill effects so I suspect most elderly who died had other health issues (ex: crappy lungs from a lifetime of smoking, obese, or, even if a normal weight now, their organs are fucked from years of fat encasing them)</p>

        <p>It could go something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Have you taken the vaccine yet? </li>
<li>B: Have you tried these pills yet? (pulling out some random pills from my pocket)</li>
<li>A: What are they? </li>
<li>B: I'm not telling what they are. Also I take no responsibility if you die or go blind if you eat these. You want some?</li>
<li>A: No thanks. </li>
<li>B: Fucking anti-medicine science denier conspiracy fool! Don't you care about others?! </li>
<li>A: What? </li>
<li>B: These pills might help everyone to get a stronger immunity. If you don't take them people might die. You're selfish! </li>
<li>A: What are they even? </li>
<li>B: I did some research on my own and found that they might help - you don't need to know more and I take no responsibility if something bad happens to you if you do take them. Are you going to eat some or not? </li>
<li>A: No thanks. </li>
<li>B: Okay fine! I guess someone doesn't care about others than! I hope you fucking die!</li>
</ul>
<p>but in all honestly, if someone asks me about the vaccine I just excuse myself and never talk to that person again, nor answer then nor acknowledge their existence. I have come to realize that it just isn't worth the risk to try to be casual with people who if this Totalitarianism continues, will just turn you in to the government if they know anything bad about you.</p>

        <p>It's honestly fucking weird.  Our skin has evolved to maximise vitamin D synthesis.  Doesn't matter - modern humans have to be modern humans - can't do anything in moderation...the sun will give you cancer, so avoid it at all costs. All or nothing.  So...nothing.   Even just 15 to 25 mins direct summer sunshine? No bro, you'll die.</p>

        <p>Yeah, people are wearing sunscreen in the freaking HOUSE. I baffles me. You need to be in the sun without SPF everyday. No, not for hours. 15-30 mins? Yes. I've always practied safe sun exposure and I do with my kids as well. We rarely get sick and when we do it's barely anything.</p>

<p>A vaccine is more like a bridge. Sure you could ask for the materials list and blueprints of a bridge before deciding to drive over it, but it's very unlikely you'll have any capacity to understand the implications of how it was built and with which materials. And if you try and argue with the engineers who built the bridge, you'll almost certainly look like an idiot.</p>

        <p>If engineers were not legally liable for the bridge collapsing, and other engineers who questioned the safety of the bridge were censored, and the bridge building company received payment every time someone drove across the bridge, and portions of the bridge did cause injury and death to some people but they had to fight in a special "bridge injury court" for compensation and the compensation was attached to a court-issued gag order... I might have a few doubts. Even more so if then a bridge was built with new technology and everyone was told they had to cross it immediately. Offered a donut if they do and loss of freedom if they don't.
Sounds legit.</p>

        <p>They just claim the bridge is where the rock lies, and because of your lack of faith make the bridge <em>not working</em>. And because other did not cross enough that pond then it has already collapsing yet still there. Those cultists are only driven by faith.</p>

        <p>That's not comparable at all, yet you are an anti-vaxer when declining an mRna injection. I mean, that's not even a vaccin. So the analogy is correct.</p>
<p>Your bridge analogy is wrong. When I want a bridge, I expect a bridge. Here you don't have a bridge workin with those vaccin: the bridge is half done and you have to swim to the other border by yourself; Some people even drown. Guess what? You can keep your shitty bridge cause I don't need to cross the river at first.</p>

        <p>There's nothing wrong with being distrustful of an ingredient you're unfamiliar with, but you act like there is something other than laziness and unfounded paranoia preventing you from researching it. Most additives aren't that complicated to understand, especially after they've been in use for decades.</p>

        <p>Shhh you're tearing apart their analogy.</p>
<p>Honestly I don't spend a great deal of time obsessing over additives because I know roughly enough about the common ones for my peace of mind. We should apply the same logic to most things, Including the vaccines. You perform whatever level of checking is enough for you, weigh up any potential issues you forsee and make the choice yourself. If anyone gets angry at that they have to explain why to you and have a discussion. If they have valid facts you missed then you can discuss it civilly. For example, I spoke with a relative recently about the vaccine they had, they were still under the false assumption it introduced dead/inert viruses into their body even though it was an mRNA vaccine. I didn't even try to change their mind on the vaccine (I am not nearly as concerned about it as many posters here), but furnished them with a crude understanding of the difference.</p>

        <p>&rt; You know what I’m saying</p>
<p>I can only guess. What you said doesn't make much sense, simply because of what a chemical is. Maybe you're not sure what you mean, either?</p>
<p>&rt; if you want to play stupid</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with playing stupid. I know what a chemical is and I was curious what you <em>actually</em> mean by "chemicals".</p>
<p>&rt; but I’m not indulging your idiotic game by explaining 😊</p>
<p>If you don't want to explain, that's your choice, but the only game you're currently indulging in is "not explaining what you're actually talking about".</p>

        <p>Enjoy your experimental vaccine, thanks for being the lab rat so the rest of us can sit back and watch what happens to you over the years.
Hope it’s not like the first round of polio vaccines that caused lifelong severe disability 😊</p>
