        <p>They don‚Äôt even know what they are talking about when they reference masks in other countries. They‚Äôre such experts yet don‚Äôt even know that pre-pandemic, Asians only wore masks when sick or poor air quality. Not to go to the gym and the mall and the grocery store.</p>

        <p>Sorry but if I feel fine I am not putting my life on hold. I am going out in public if I want or need to. If that scares you, YOU stay home. It‚Äôs not like I go out coughing and sneezing and spitting on people for fun. And I shouldn‚Äôt have to wear a mask with no symptoms of anything. Let me guess, you support masks being permanent for everybody?</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs the thing: even in the midst of the global pandemic we all can go out and live your lives and that‚Äôs great! Only inconvenience is, we have to put on a more-or-less simple cloth when getting into close contact with strangers because as I said: we don‚Äòt know if we currently spread the virus until several days later. 
I don‚Äôt fancy doing this at all but I recognize that it‚Äôs a temporary inconvenience that will help us to come out of this the best we can.</p>

<p>Your privilege is showing.  You think it's "just an incovenience"?  Try working a public-facing job where you have to wear a mask for 8+ hours a day, especially one which isn't exactly high-paying.  And just for shits and giggles, try adding in summer heat and heavy lifting.  That gets you my husband's job.  And it is hell.  And there are many people like him for whom masks are a great deal more than an "inconvenience".</p>

        <p>Again this is one of the few considerate posts in a thread that largely shows contempt for science, scientists and for some part general decency when speaking with each other. Thanks for that! 
You‚Äôre right, I must say that I am indeed privileged and do not have to face a situation like you are describing in my job. Therefore: yes, we should probably make more differences in who must wear a mask and who can be exempt. I get that it could be helpful for some. Then again, for the most part these are not the voices I hear. The loudest to clamor are often those who make a big fuss about themselves when they are ‚Äûforced‚Äú and ‚Äûsuffer‚Äú to mask up for 10 minutes in the grocery store. At the same time ‚Äûvictims‚Äú and ‚Äûbrave rebels‚Äú and I have really no sympathy for these strange wannabe-tough wimps. (Sorry for the final rant, it really is an emotional topic after all.)</p>

        <p>I had this thought just the other day. Masks, if ever, will be the last thing to go. They will allow full capacity (with masks), concerts and sports (with masks) etc. Im really starting to think masks will be either long term (2 years) or permanent. Its absolutely awful</p>

        <p>That's why no one should show up if muzzles are required. JUST DON'T GO. If no one shows up, they'll get it. They won't want to lose the revenue that comes from huge sports/concert venues. Money is God to them. The teams and musicians can't stand playing without their fans. They want those stadiums packed. It may be hard at first, but show them up front,  that no way will you spend your time and money in a place that makes masks mandatory.</p>

        <p>The problem is people will show up because there seems to be large numbers of people that don't mind masks. I don't understand it, as I can't breathe properly in them, but many people seem able to. I see tons of people walking outside wearing masks, sometimes far away from anyone or even jogging/biking with masks and young, healthy looking people to. If masks bothered these people even 1/10th as much as they bother me there is no way they would do this. No one enforces mask wearing outside and there is no need for it when not near other people. Even if you are strong mask believer, you could wear it under your chin and then pull it up anytime you see someone coming but I see people wearing it over their mouth and nose when walking down the street with no one else in sight. I can only conclude that for whatever reason, they are not particularly bothered by it. I even had a coworker who told me he plans to keep wearing his even after the pandemic is over "to be safe".</p>
<p>So good luck getting these people to not go to events. The smaller crowds will also attract people as parking will be easier, lines shorter, etc. You know that lovely feeling when you show up somewhere on a day when it was supposed to rain or something and you basically have the whole place to yourself? That alone will be a draw for certain types of people.</p>

<p>I have two theories about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A lot of people are very socially awkward and the mask gives them an "out" with human interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They actually <em>are</em> uncomfortable, but the social pressure is really getting to them.  Case in point, the ones who wear masks all the time on hiking trails, even when no one is close by.  They probably feel anxious when someone approaches and it's "time" to pull the mask up, so it's easier for them to simply wear it the whole time and avoid that feeling of anxiety.</p>

        <p>But what I'm saying is, if that's the case they can't be bothered much by the mask or else the natural urge to pull it down would outweigh that momentary anxiety. Today on my way to the store I saw a girl riding a bike with a mask over a dangerous bridge (lots of traffic, narrow bike lane) where there are rarely any pedestrians. About a mile down I passed by an old lady walking down the sidewalk with a mask. So the only two people I passed by both had masks and like I said this area has very few pedestrians. If you saw someone coming you would have plenty of time to walk more than 6 ft around them and/or put a mask on. It's a wide open area, there are no sharp bends where you would be surprised by someone.</p>

        <p>My concern with that, is that it will send the opposite message, and they'll think people are scared and no one is showing up because they aren't doing <em>enough</em> safety theatre... and then it will just get even worse.  Need a way to make it clear what the reason is that we're not there.</p>

Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees. ‚ÄúA COVID-19 vaccine is likely not going to provide sterilizing immunity the way the measles vaccine does,‚Äù he tells Yahoo Life. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to still need to take protective measures for some time period, potentially until a second-generation vaccine is developed.‚Äù</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; Cennimo says masks may be a good option in the future for high-risk settings and settings with close contact ‚Äúeven after COVID-19 has died down.‚Äù Masks could also help prevent the spread of the common cold, rhinoviruses and the flu ‚Äújust the same‚Äù as COVID-19, since they‚Äôre transmitted similarly, he says.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other similar tidbits in here, but yes, this is not clickbait, they are basically saying we need to wear masks for a long, <em>long</em> time.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm probably going to regret this but I believe we have to finally overcome the partisanship that is showing in nearly every modern issue and especially the corona crisis. Therefore: they said masks ‚Äúmay be a good option‚Äù even after the covid crisis, just like they have been for many years in Asian countries where they are considered to be polite. In western countries we did not see this as common or necessary before. I expect some will continue using them in a regular flu season, some won‚Äôt. 
The expert suggests it might be a good idea to consider wearing them even after the pandemic. Nowhere do they say that they should be mandatory after the acute crisis has been dealt with.</p>

        <p>Okay, so you‚Äôre saying it shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory in a situation of an acute pandemic. But the general public says we would all benefit from it. How is this different from not texting while driving, not letting a loaded firearm lying unattended or not lighting a bonfire in a dust-dry forest? It‚Äôs all generally considered dangerous and therefore they were at some time prohibited. In the case of say bonfires temporarily, until the situation has changed and is less dangerous to the general public.</p>
<p>Edit: unfortunately people will rather downvote a question and opposing stance than engaging in the discussion. I know it‚Äôs the draw of the personal bubble but I wanted to try and leave my bubble for a change.</p>

        <p>There will be some endgame, but we can influence whether it costs more or less lives. We have learned to tame several deadly diseases, especially within the last hundred years. Either we will have gradually better vaccines, the virus will get weaker over time (there are some hints to that already) or we will finally reach herd immunity at the cost of countless of preventable deaths if we discard the effective measures at hand. 
First generation vaccines will possibly not be strong enough to make up for all other measures, like the article said. But research will go on and we will see better vaccines emerging in 2021 and 2022. This is a temporary crisis, and it is up to us how good we manage it and how we will come out of it.</p>

        <p>Maybe there really is some different perception. It‚Äôs a pretty strong stance if you say you would rather be a victim of covid (and by not wearing a mask also victimize others) than having to endure wearing a mask. What kind of misery is there in it? Compared to the misery of severe respiratory disfunction and possibly death for some? 
Are we so easily irritated and delicate that this is unbearable? People have compared this crisis to a war at the beginning and though I don‚Äôt like the undertones of that I also see where it came from: we‚Äòll have to deal with some inconveniences for some time in order to win in the long run. 
I don‚Äôt fancy wearing masks either, but it really could be a lot worse. And if there‚Äôs a rainstorm I put on a coat, if there‚Äôs a global pandemic I‚Äôll put on some more or less simple cloth in front of my mouth and nose. No big deal.</p>

        <p>It won‚Äôt be indefinitely. And none of the professionals in the article said something about indefinite, mandatory mask usage despite the click bait title. They simply ponder the idea that people in western cultures might grow more used to using masks and some might keep the custom even after the pandemic has ceased. 
Regarding the self-sacrifice: it‚Äòs not like the virus would care. No one will suffer less for people who are willingly contracting it. Quite the contrary. I‚Äòm afraid this doesn‚Äôt make much sense to me. </p>
<p>I get how certain measures like prohibition of events will also have vast negative effects and even kill people. Specifically the measure of wearing a mask - not so much, though.</p>

        <p>It wasn‚Äôt exactly a weeks difference but I agree that this has been harmful for the whole process.

<p>But maybe they really found new evidence, be it like it is: it‚Äôs the very nature of science to constantly produce new findings and to contradict what past science had been holding to be true. That is the very thing we call science: building new theories upon results that people gain from research. And if you are confronted with a new phenomenon like a new virus, thousands of scientists start studying it and I would expect nothing else than occasional shifts in what they find out about this nasty little vermin.</p>

        <p>If you are infected, the virus starts to transmit a couple of days before you even recognize that you have it. That is the reason why people are asked to wear them even if they feel healthy. It‚Äôs because there is no way you can tell if you are currently healthy or not. To stay in the metaphor:
We are all drivers, that‚Äôs not a choice unless you self-isolate. You might text and drive and turn out fine. You might even do it several times and not hurt anybody or yourself. That doesn‚Äôt mean you do it because you know you won‚Äòt crash. You can get lucky but there is a good chance that you won‚Äôt, especially if you do it several times a day. When you have close unprotected contact with people several times a day in the current situation there is a good chance people will rapidly transmit covid to other people.

        <p>Yes there are easy ways to tell your healthy. How about do you feel good? Is your temperature normal? Are you having pain or inflammation?  Do you have a sore throat?</p>

        <p>As I said: you will feel perfectly healthy and still be infectious if you carry it. The disease / feeling sick only shows after you have distributed the virus for a couple of days, then after some days you might realize you feel sick. It‚Äôs too late to take back the infections you have caused in the previous days.</p>

        <p>This will be my last reply to you. Clearly your belief in indoctrinated corona virus fear is too intrenched in your psyche.  One of 2 people who I know got it, he didn't manage to spread it to anyone else in his family or his girlfriend (my wife's sister) who he had been intimate with and slept with up to the point where he got tested. In fact he wouldn't have known he had it if his job hadn't required him to get tested. Had a party and saw him a week after he felt better. Shook his hand and gave him a hug for good measure. Surprise no one at my party got sick and there were no masks and certainly no social distancing.</p>

        <p>&rt; But the general public says we would all benefit from it.</p>
<p>The "general public" is a bunch of stupid, panicky animals, most of whom don't understand simple math.  The general public, historically, does things like persecute astronomers who insist the earth revolves around the sun, insist homosexuality is a mental illness, treat other races as inferior, etc.  Just because the general public "says" something does not make it right.</p>
<p>&rt; How is this different from not texting while driving, not letting a loaded firearm lying unattended or not lighting a bonfire in a dust-dry forest?</p>
<p>Because a car accident and a forest fire are risks to all, and bear a far, FAR greater risk of dying.  For <em>everyone</em>.  The data is there.  We <em>know</em> COVID only kills 0.6% of the elderly, and even then there is usually some comorbidity.  We <em>know</em> who we're really supposed to be protecting--not healthy young people but the elderly and the immuno-compromised.  As far as masking goes, sure wear masks in public spaces that are "essential", like public transportation and grocery stores.  However, movie theaters, sit-down restaurants and hiking trails are not essential places.  If someone is in the vulnerable category or lives with someone who is, it is on them to minimize their own risk by avoiding non-essential places.  Even with masks and physical distancing, the risk of going anywhere is not zero.  If you are vulnerable and go to these places, you are accepting that the risk--any risk--is worth it for you.  And you do not have the right to make these experiences miserable for the majority by insisting everyone accommodate you.  If you live with someone vulnerable and go unnecessary places, you are saying that your ability to have fun is more important than minimizing exposure for your housemate, which is pretty damned selfish if you ask me.  </p>
<p>In short, I am perfectly willing to mask up to go somewhere that is necessary to everyone.  I am <em>not</em> willing to mask up and be uncomfortable while doing things that are non-essential and fun, just so someone else can do those things with reduced (but non-zero) risk.  </p>
<p>In general, though, masks seem to be doing very little to "slow the spread", anyway.  Places like Spain and CA are highly mask compliant, and it seems to make very little difference.  I am willing to accept that masks work in a laboratory setting, and with perfect usage, but as a policy they do not seem terribly effective.</p>

        <p>I should have worded the part about the ‚Äûgeneral public‚Äú differently and I can see myself reacting to that the same way you did if I had read it. Let me put it differently:
Nearly all people believe that our society has trained capable scientists (at least that‚Äôs in Europe but I hear the US‚Äô universities aren‚Äôt so bad, either. /s). And nearly all of society relied on the findings and qualified predictions of those scientists when the pandemic hit. I just don‚Äôt understand people who are sitting in their armchair, with no relevant qualification for the question at hand, pondering that they of all people have figured out what hundreds of highly trained scientists have not figured out about the virus yet.<br>
Speaking of which: 
I do think your 0,6% figure for the group of elderly doesn‚Äôt match up. All reputable scientists I hear say that we have to treat the numbers with caution, since there are many factors who play a role in altering the overall lethality. It varies from country to country but I never heard it to be as low as you said it would be for the elderly. 
One last objection before I agree to one of your points: Regarding masks that don‚Äôt work: how do you know how our numbers would look like if we hadn‚Äôt used mask the whole time? You can‚Äôt. And evidence is rather pointing to them working. So for me and most others it‚Äôs just no big deal going along with it. 
Now that that‚Äôs out of the way: you honestly got me thinking on the last part. Thinking about who will be more at risk and making individual choices based on that might be a more important vector than it currently is. Maybe this could be a way to gain more normalcy for a part of the public. Maybe we can see some changes in that direction in the following months. But for some time to come it will still be a lot of weighing up and so far most of us in Europe are not that unsatisfied because we see that things may have gotten far worse. (And probably will get so in the months to come.)</p>

        <p>It gives governors the permission to make them permanent. Saying this a vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective that constant mask wearing and other restrictions are the only way tin‚Äùprotect‚Äù everyone </p>
<p>Notice how there is almost no discussion about when mask wearing will end. Not even a hint from people in power</p>

        <p>Well, every pessimistic worst-case scenario prediction of overreaction I've thought of has already come true, so I'm just gonna come out and say it.  I predicted masks would become permanent because too many hypochondriacs and doomers would become complacent and just let it happen, and lo and behold, that could be coming true.  And I'll keep saying this:  we are NOT a majority or even, unfortunately, much of a significant minority.  We're losing.  And I am saying this from a state that didn't even lock down.  I see too many doomers even here, and even though he didn't mandate them, our governor is trying to get the mask propaganda out there by offering a butt-ton of money to a PR firm that wants to do it.  We continue to lose.  Good gravy, my generation SUCKS.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve been thinking this since the beginning, masks will be the last to go. They will allow full capacity sports/concerts/nightlife/movie theaters before there‚Äôs any serious talk about mask mandates being relaxed. </p>
<p>I live in NJ, a pretty blue state, and while people are adhering to the mask mandate in indoor businesses, almost no one is wearing them while doing stuff outside. If you go to the park in my town, you‚Äôll see maybe 1 out 3 people wearing a mask, and people are hanging out in 10-15 person groups without them.</p>
