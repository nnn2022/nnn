    <strong>I don't ever want to hear these virtue signallers mention mental health ever again.</strong>
    <p><p>What has been happening for the past 6 months has been an absolute travesty in terms of mental health. Suicides, anxiety, depression, etc. They are all on the rise in astronomic levels. Before the pandemic these guys would always talk about how important mental health and taking care of it is. Well, where are they now?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, they're caught up in the newest trendy thing to virtue signal about. All the outlets people would normally use to cope and heal their mental health have been taken away and these doomers are absolutely gleeful of that fact. You're now called selfish, sent hate mail and death threats for daring to want your normal life back. Let's get this straight: <strong>you're not selfish for wanting that back. It's them who are selfish to take it away from you because they're scared.</strong></p>
<p>If you are dealing with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, you're not alone. It wasn't long ago that I was going to become just another statistic in the suicide counter due to these lockdowns. But just remember that you don't matter to these people, they don't and never cared about you. Look how quickly they abandoned you for the next fad.</p>
<p>I know that I won't forget, and I won't forgive. So to you, the doomer, take that little blue Twitter checkmark and shove it. I don't ever want to see you talk about mental health ever again. In fact, I don't want to hear you talk about any societal issues. You've shown your true colors to the world, that you only care about looking good in front of others, and I hope the world doesn't forget.</p></p>

        <p>The closure and/or limited capacities of gyms and the mask mandates while exercising in gyms are two of the facets of the current situation that annoy me to no end. </p>
<p>I also went on my first business trip since the COVID craziness started this past week. Either the airport food vendors were totally closed, or they had limited menus that offered chips, snack mixes, candy, pizza, burgers, fries and various soft drinks and alcohol. There wasn't anything remotely healthy. McDonald's, which was operating in the Denver and Orlando airports, has a limited menu that now excludes any type of salad. The Starbucks in each of these locations also lacked any salads. I know healthy airport eating can be relatively difficult even in the pre-COVID time, but also in Denver currently, the water fountains were inoperable with a sign on the wall above them saying it was this way to stop the spread of COVID. </p>
<p>Could there be more manipulation to make people unhealthy?! (I'm sure there could be--I'm just incredibly irritated to say the least.)</p>

        <p>ugh yeah this whole thing is such BS</p>
<p>my gym just cancelled my group yoga classes until "everything is normal" and when i pressed for what that means, they said it means a vaccine</p>
<p>my yoga classes are effectively cancelled forever</p>
<p>i have to tell you fine people that cancelling my best chance for a good workout and stress relief is probably not great for my mental or physical health</p>
<p>about six years ago i started taking these yoga classes and it really helped me get in physical shape and was great for my mental health, and i have a gym that i love that i've been going to for two years, and now that's cancelled.</p>
<p>yoga has always been a place to go after a long or stressful day at work, and Saturday morning yoga was one of my favorite weekend activities. i just feel better after yoga. group classes hold me accountable. i like working out with other people. i like working with an instructor who knows what they are doing.</p>
<p>i'm really afraid my mind and body might actually go off the rails, and i'm only missing out on group yoga. what the fuck about people who can't get to a therapist or afford medication? people are already sinking into depression and anxiety and anger without an outlet for group sports and workouts. </p>
<p>PEOPLE NEED THE GYM FOR A REASON, ASSHOLES. WE CAN'T ALL AFFORD A SWANKY HOME GYM AND A PELETON AND A PERSONAL TRAINER. MAYBE SOME PEOPLE NEED A LITTLE HELP FROM THEIR FRIENDS.</p>
<p>well, if it saves one life, i guess my mental health can get bent.</p>

        <p>Out of everything that we can't do right now, i think the thing i miss most is not being able to go to the gym, believe it or not. Having not been able to go for awhile now, I've noticed my physical and mental wellness are declining rapidly.</p>
<p>I live in CA, and feel like i have absolutely no idea when gyms will be coming back. I used to think that things were a month or 2 away from getting better, but now i have no reason not to believe that they won't be back until well into 2021.</p>

        <p>One of the problems for us is that CA opened up a bit in late June, but then shut again very quickly. That hurts us mentally because if CA opens up again, we know Newsom could shut it down again just as fast.</p>
<p>I got my hair done a few weeks ago and it was a totally clandestine operation. Park in the back, go through this one unmarked door, etc. it felt like a going to a speakeasy during Prohibition.</p>

        <p>I am in California as well. My mental and physical health rely heavily upon social connection and exercise— both of which I received from social dancing (partner dancing, such as swing, Latin, ballroom). I was in the best health of my life— quite the accomplishment with a lifelong nervous system disorder which makes daily living painful and mental health a struggle. I knew right away, when they wanted to “lockdown” that I would be fucked. I honestly have no idea how I have managed to live this long in this hell. Each and every day is a struggle, and the “invasive thoughts” are near constant.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry. I am right here with you. Honestly my mental health is pretty bad anyway, but the gym is the one thing I have that gives me a break from all that and that makes me feel good. I was borderline suicidal during lockdown and the gym opening was the one thing that “saved” me. Now where I am gyms are opening in a few wks finally but they require masks with no exemptions. I have ptsd and asthma and cannot wear a mask, especially when my breathing is already labored so apparently no gym for me still. </p>
<p>This week has been a saving grace, I’m back home with family and gyms are open here. Unfortunately most have taken the state mandate (that includes medical exemptions) to mean no exemptions whatsoever and the gym I was going to earlier this summer no longer lets me work out without a mask even for med reasons. I found 1 in my area not requiring them and it’s so nice. Nobody wears them, we all talk and spot each other, no crazy distancing or half the machines closed, just normal gym. My mental health has taken such an upswing this week and I’m so sad I have to go back to where I live normally, where god knows how long it’ll be until I can go to a gym. </p>
<p>I feel you and I’m right here with you. Guess my ptsd isn’t as “important” as Covid, even though mental health awareness was all the rage months ago. What a sad state this world is. I hope they come to their senses and start your classes again.</p>

        <p>A little late to the party but man did your comment hit home with me. </p>
<p>I love yoga. I found yoga by accident and it has had such a profound impact on my life both physically and mentally. I even did teacher training. Since the lockdown, my studio has been offering a ton of Zoom classes but it’s just not the same. I know many are able to have a home practice but to me being in a class full of like minded individuals was energizing. I fed off it and my practice improved because of it.  There is no virtual replacement for a teacher who can read the room and offer adjustments and suggestions for taking a pose further.  I’m not faulting the teachers here. I taught a few zoom classes myself and it sucked. The students gave positive feedback but I just didn’t like it. I felt like I was narrating a home practice which I’ve already said I’m not great at.  They asked me to continue but I just couldn’t bring myself to to it because I teach by feel. How do you get a sense of where your students are at from a tiny screen of thumbnails?</p>
<p>Now, my practice is a shadow of its old self. My mental and physical well being is deteriorating.  All while continuing to do zoom classes as often as I used to do in person classes. It’s crazy, I’m quite introverted but yoga was different for me.  Being around others made me a better person. Just to have it all ripped away by an irrational fear stoked by politicians and the media. </p>
<p>I’m sorry to unload on you with my rant, it’s been on my mind a lot lately and seeing your comment brought out my frustration.  I am frustrated that my life had to change because a small percentage is “at risk”. I feel marginalized because my well being is irrelevant.  I feel anger because I’m told I’m selfish for wanting to do what is best for me. </p>
<p>I just want to be the best me I can be, but it feels like the deck is stacked against me. I’m not giving up, I continue to force myself to do the zoom classes but it’s starting to feel like a chore. </p>
<p>Thanks for letting me rant. Here’s to hoping we can get back to working on us soon.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, the "suck it up" attitudes that are being pushed on depressed/anxious people just speeds up the process. </p>
<p>As someone who deals with a lot of depression/anxiety, its hard to deal with such an indefinite timeline. The idea that we "have no idea" how long things will take is one of the most frustrating things I've ever experienced. And to any doomer reading this, yeah I know the "virus doesn't care about time" so you can shove that right up your ass. </p>
<p>Anyway, yeah I better not hear any virtue signaling bullshit about mental health anymore. Ill just continue to work on myself, I dont need you</p>

        <p>All of those recent years of discourse about the importance of mental health and of destigmatizing mental health have been exposed as completely empty virtue signalling, all of it, the whole thing. This issue in particular is really what has brutally confirmed to me, a formerly woke liberal, that the whole edifice of woke politics is built of virtue signalling and nothing else. When you believe in a principle, you don’t just believe in it when it’s socially easy. You stick to your guns when your peers turn against you. None of these gutless moral cowards did that because they never gave a shit about mental health in the first place. “Mental health awareness” was just the accessory that it was fashionable to wear for a season.</p>

<p>Precisely. I stand up for LGBT rights, I've verbally announced that I support them. In this extremely conservative country that I live in (seriously it will make the bible belt look like states that do daily Pride Parades), I've been verbally and physically threatened. Thankfully, a few friends who know I have a different mentality were able to calm the situation before it got out of hand. You don't get to advocate for them just because it gets you social brownie points.</p>

        <p>I've been dealing with social anxiety, deep loneliness, and suicidal thoughts for years, and had finally started to really commit to changing myself and my life from last year until March this spring. There was a craft brewery that was near my house that had live music and a good crowd once a week and a social club that met at my church once a month, and I committed to going each time no matter how uncomfortable it made me. I made a lot of progress, all of which is totally gone now.</p>
<p>But what really makes my blood boil is seeing the things I've suffered from being inflicted on millions of kids, and scumbags that have never had to feel that kind of pain acting like it's a minor inconvenience rather than a debilitating curse. For example, some of the thing's that have caused me big problems over the years is an intense fear of being touched by other people, the inability to look others in the eye, and a near total lack of ability to read and recognize faces. How many kids are going through whatever developmental window that allows them to learn to read and recognize faces seeing nothing but masks and dark sunglasses on everyone? Bumping in to friends or family at an unexpected place and not recognizing them is incredibly embarrassing, as well as not picking up when someone is sad or mad, and it all makes you second guess yourself all the time. Nearly every kid I saw among the customers at work this past spring and summer was hiding behind their parents and keeping their eyes down. I've never been able to fix that problem in myself; how many of these kids will be trapped in the same behavior as well? No one trusts you if you don't look them in the eye. And the worst of it is all these hysterical nutjobs screeching at their kids to fear human touch. Being afraid of touch is a horrible way for a human to live, and near as I can tell there's just no way to fix it. Not being able to be comforted by a hug is absolutely miserable, and is just the start of problems being afraid of touch causes. The idea that millions of kids could be forced to grow up to be just as unhappy as I've been makes me see red.</p>

        <p>I’ve felt exactly what you and others here describe on a deep, visceral level. For all their talk about “mental health”, they’ve sure changed their tune when it comes to pushing the almighty globalist agenda. What this will do to children, never mind what it’s doing to the rest of us, is criminal and unconscionable.💔</p>

        <p>I both work in mental health and have had my own mental health struggles. These people <em>never</em> cared in the first place, they merely pretended to when sharing mental health and suicide awareness posts mostly on days it seemed most beneficial to their image - <em>RU ok day?</em> in Australia, and any mental health awareness days or weeks. Professing that mental illness is real and serious, it's ok not be ok! Please ask for help! You can talk to me! </p>
<p>It was all a lie from these people, now attacking those struggling as selfish. The narrative is back to <em>just get over it</em>, <em>suck it up</em>, <em>we are all in this together and if I'm fine you are fine, now get over yourself</em>... mental health is a non issue now and this attitude is costing lives. The damage done by lockdowns and all this will continue costing lives long-term, including in children now suffering mental health problems. The seeds for future suicides have been sown. </p>
<p>I hate these people. The top cause of death for 15-44 year olds is suicide in my country. It's third for 45-64 year olds. Depression is also the third top cause of DALYs (healthy years of life lost) for the entire population, and for younger age groups it's the top cause. It's not just death that is significant. But sure, dismiss mental health...</p>
<p>Edit to add - I know people professionally and personally who have ended their lives as a result. Or attempted to end their lives. I myself am struggling not to do the same.</p>

        <p>To people who have lost the ability to do their hobbies and feel malcontent as a result, I suggest getting out in nature anyway you can. It adheres to «social distancing» norms, and has a calming influence that is used in many kinds of therapy and treatment. People underestimate the wonders being in nature does for you.</p>
<p>One super-enjoyable way to do that nearby is often on a kayak or canoe.
At least for me it gives me everything I am missing when working from home. 
Also: consider bringing a fishing-rod.</p>

        <p>This is absolutely correct. Not only have people with non-Covid physical illnesses been ignored, but the lockdown has affected people with a) existing mental health issues and b) people who were happy previously, but found themselves in a lonely depression after - I simply don't understand how they can begin to fathom justifying this.</p>

        <p>Well, I don't believe in a grand election conspiracy. Maybe 10% of it is true. The media will probably stop screeching about it after the elections.</p>
<p>After reading a lot of the research published about this for 7 months and looking at regional data and curves, plus my own medical background, I'm firmly in the camp of it's going to burn itself out before we can distribute a vaccine.</p>
