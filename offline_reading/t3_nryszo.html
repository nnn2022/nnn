    <strong>If the virus was manufactured, what’s the point? (Not a troll post, genuinely asking)</strong>
    <p><p>Why would the government intentionally release a virus, or manufacture a hoax about a virus?</p>
<p>They are already in control of the people and infrastructure, so it doesn’t seem like that.
They already track us through phones, so it can’t be that.
It could be to make money, but the economy has been destroyed and thousands of potential tax payers are dead.</p>
<p>What is the argument for it all being manufactured or a hoax, as I cannot see it?</p></p>

        <p>Could i recommended watching a few videos by James Corbett? He explains things quite well.</p>
<p>You ask why would the government create this hoax, which government are you referring to? Because this has happened in most countries of the world. It's not one government organising this, there are many many different interests pushing at the same time. Just look at who benefits.</p>
<p>Governments all around the world have increased emergency powers to basically create marshall law at a whim. How many trillions have vaccine companies made in the last year? The richest have gotten richer and the poor have gotten poorer. There's a graph somewhere on this sub showing the extent of this wealth transfer. At the same time, it's even more ok now for social networks to just remove anything they want and control the groupthink.</p>
<p>Many groups are benefiting from the covid panic</p>

        <p>Releasing and manufacturing are two different things.
They could create one just for the sake of research but release could be accidental.</p>

        <p>Your question is a false dilemma of either or. It's manufactured or it's fake </p>
<p>In March 2020 the WHO predicted an infected mortality rate of 3.4%</p>
<p>The worlds Governments reacted to that number.</p>
<p>That number was 1200% off. It's .02% </p>
<p>The problem is the Governments are still reacting like it was 3.4% and have known it's .02% for over a year </p>
<p>As to what's the point? We had the largest transfer of wealth from the middle class to the ultra wealthy in modern history.</p>

        <p>Gain of function research. Or a bioweapon, and I only mention it because Fauci’s emails refer to a covid strain as such. Release was most likely accidental. Researchers at Wuhan lab were sick with mild symptoms before the mass spread began(to our knowledge). I don’t think it was intentional.. just a giant mistake that was horribly mishandled.</p>
<p>Look into gain of function research to see why they even make animal viruses more infectious to humans.</p>

        <p>Like u/johnkyle4 said, "your question is a false dilemma".</p>
<p>It has always seemed like the lab-leak hypothesis was the obvious suspect given the crazy viral research facility there in Wuhan and I feel dumb for buying into the wet market hypothesis now.</p>
<p>What was the point of the research?  Obviously an engineered virus could have all sorts of messed up capabilities as a weapon by only targeting specific demographics etc.  I don't think there is much compelling evidence that supports an intentional release v. accidental.</p>
<p>I don't really understand what you mean by hoax though.</p>

        <p>The government is not in control of the population in the same way as North Korea &amp; China, for example.  You can control what people see, hear, say, do, wear, eat, and think to much much greater degree than what we have now.  Tech, politically interested billionaires, and governments have been sewing the seeds, and Rona was the supercharged fertilizer...but trust me, it can get worse. Read about North Korea (Try Yeonmi Park, In order to live) and read about China's social control (anyone who speaks against government on text or social media is thrown in jail, gov organ harvesting, social credit system etc) .  They don't yet track us internally, but Gates himself has been openly talking about doing this for years, and has been working on that technology, one can only conclude to use it.  As for it all being hoax, if Fauchi's email leaks, the researchers and doctors speaking out that have been cancelled, the manipulation and social control of Zuckerberg/Facebook etc, Gates, Event 201, and the actual numbers they give you (a tiny tiny number of people die from covid  during the same time period the claim nobody died from flu as they did in previous years in numbers) This is not a "deadly virus" this is a bad flu virus which the vast majority are capable of fighting and building their own Life-Long natural immunity to</p>
