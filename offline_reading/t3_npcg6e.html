    <strong>Covid might be old? Or viruses lab made? Personal story</strong>
    <p><p>This is long but hear me out:
//
In 2012, I went to a trip down South India. I came back and after a week, had fever, chills, shivering, diarrhoea, tingling sensation in hands and feet and difficulty breathing. Was hospitalised and diagnosed with dengue. Spent two days in delirium then a week later was discharged. Don’t know what drugs I was given. Have no reports of those tests except the report mentioning I had dengue.
//
Then a month later, I was travelling, and had the same breathlessness issue. Was rushed to ER and put on oxygen for the night. Heart rate was up (the doctor said) but it was a makeshift kind of clinic, so didn’t have proper reports. 
//
Came back home and consulted doctor. Said anxiety and weakness due to dengue. Tried to prescribe anti-anxiety pills. Didn’t take after first dose as it gave bad dreams. Didn’t go back to the doctor though did take Vit D and Calcium supplements. Then again same attack a few months later while eating dinner. Back to ER. Same heart rate stabilising med.
//
Then the next four years of feeling breathless, always in the evening and oftentimes at night. Weird feeling that wakes me up to find my heart pounding. I begged my body to heal from this, as I didn’t want to put drugs into it. Long difficult road to recovery.
//
Then, one day, out of a sudden in July, I feel a burning/tingling sensation in my lower leg side at night. I rub it and it subsides after an hour. I go back to sleep and over the next days, I start feeling unexplained pain and numbness/tingling in arms, back, hips, legs, shoulder blades, neck. But always on one side of the body. And now it has been 5 years of this. Shown to doctors but they don’t have any answers. 
//
No more desirous of being a Guinea pig/wasting money. 
//
If this happened now, I would be diagnosed as Covid and a long-hauler.
Never known anyone with similar dengue. 
//
So, how come dengue virus acts so similar to Covid? I didn’t have any rash, any muscle/bone pain in 2012 as symptomatic of dengue. Only fever but low - 102. My mother had dengue in 2010 and her symptoms were these, but not mine.
//
So what if I was misdiagnosed? Or if viruses are lab made (can’t discount after Covid), are they being introduced into populations since some years back?
//
My life has completely changed since 2012. Whatever I had I always felt was not natural ... like a gut feeling. Since I was travelling, I can’t say how I got it.
I have had such good health before that. Never falling sick. Never availed sick leaves in school/college/or work.
Because I am mentally strong, I haven’t let this affect me in any major psychological way - still work, do household chores more than an average person. I am from India and this whole COVID vaccine scene has made me question - important: I was the only completely asymptomatic Covid person with Ct 17 in my family this November. My father was hospitalised, my mother and brother showed cold and diarrhoeal symptoms for two days. 
//
I was a zoology (cell biology, microbiology and immunology) major back in the days. Now I am questioning that science and viruses. 
//
Any inputs welcome. Thank you if you read this far. Just wanted to see how others think about this. (I was suggested to test for IgG for dengue to confirm but this is all so old and I don’t want to go back to that phase. Not Lyme/Bartonella/etc.). I don’t take any medicines for my issues. Just want to live as free as possible until death has me.</p></p>

        <p>Have a look at German New Medicine if you haven't already. Might not be for you but I think everyone should at least understand what it's about. 
Big Pharma has made and kept a lot of western society sick whilst also suppressing true and natural treatments and remedies. As well as this, the true nature of the illness is rarely delved into as it doesn't make financial sense to cure people.</p>

        <p>I am trying to understand the terrain theory. My symptoms do resonate with the phasal concepts that describes. But since I can’t pinpoint the trigger, I only have the option of eating healthy and staying healthy and not putting more medicines in me. Thanks for this.</p>

        <p>Guys. </p>
<p>SARS 2 is 100% lab made. How else did it acquire HIV sequences and the germ of malaria, a parasitic, non-viral disease? Why are They forcing Nobel laureates and scientists to recant their testimonies and recall their papers?  </p>
<p>100% lab made.</p>

        <p>I meant maybe something similar to it was there in the population at that time too - 2012. Such bats exist in South India, too. Who knows where all such experiments have been happening since when funded by who knows whom! I am a vegan and only ate cooked food and never wandered into forests that time. So whatever I had was acquired through respiratory/airborne route. But because it’s symptoms are so freakishly similar to covid, I don’t know what to think ...</p>

        <p>SARS2 is BATCoV + SARS 1 + HIV so not natural. Also, the bats were 1000km away from Wuhan Inst Virology. They used a bat virus as the backbone and claimed bats were the natural reservoir for a lab made virus. You were misdiagnosed, for money, it sounds like.</p>
