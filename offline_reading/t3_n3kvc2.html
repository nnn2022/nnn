    <strong>I got to be bare faced in a business for the first time in over a year</strong>
    <p><p>I was waiting my turn in the lobby of a place doing service on my car. All the other customers were masked, but I noticed the woman running the place would keep hers on my chin as she came in and out from the garage to the service desk. Then I heard two other people in the back say “oops there’s customers, guess I gotta put the mask on” so I knew it was safe to pull mine down too. So I got to have a nice, genuine interaction with the woman as I got checked out. It was bizarre, and it was bizarre that simply smiling at someone was bizarre, but it was really freeing. Too bad I can’t go there more often, it was a family business too. Just wanted to share the nice, normal moment I had, lol.</p></p>

        <p>Stop being scared and just walk into stores without it even on. Fuck that chin diaper shit, just don't wear it at all. If the business won't let you enter and you must shop there, take it out of your pocket, but keep it below the nose once you get out of their line of sight. No sense risking bacterial pneumonia.</p>

        <p>My stance is if a business requires a mask .. force them to force you out .. or outright boycott their store .. I personally don't get out too much but when I do .. I absolutely refuse to put on a mask and never will</p>

        <p>A good way to tell if it's OK is to look for the owner or manager. If they don't have a mask on or wear it below their chin, you're probably good to not have one.</p>
