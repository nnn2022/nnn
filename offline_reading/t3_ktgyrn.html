    <strong>Psychological warfare</strong>
    <p><p>My thoughts, this has been years long psychological warfare and it is going perfectly for the elite. This is the art of war, Donald Trump as a member of the elite, was used to separate the people who would fight back and challenge the New Order. He was put in place as the leader and rallied the fighters just as designed. Then he is publicly defeated and he probably will be humiliated in some way because of the psychological effect of defeating his followers. This makes it easier for the New Order to be implemented because many of the followers have now already been defeated mentally. </p>
<p>The psychological campaign in MSM will continue to punish him and his followers, a fear tactic to keep any freedom fighters quite. </p>
<p>Relinquish your property, relinquish your guns, work and be happy to eat the slaves are all one. We are only safe when we do what they say.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, this gives power-players <em>way</em> too much credit. They aren't omnipotent or omniscient. They would love it if we thought that, and many of us would love them to be as it makes our struggle so much more heroic, but they aren't: they are just exceptional networkers colluding to acquire wealth at others' expense on a larger scale than most people. Donald Trump makes sense as a rogue oligarch who genuinely upset them - e.g. the Gracchi brothers - but another stooge of a shadowy cabal? Nah. They torn up their own self-serving norms to get him out; they made identities and motivations public. They took risks. There is no strategic reason to do that unless the threat is real. <em>That</em> is the Art of War.</p>
