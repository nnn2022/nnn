    <strong>70% of America will be vaccinated by September 1st</strong>
    <p><p>According to recent projections, it's expected that 70% of the US will be vaccinated. Almost 3/4 of the country. That number blows my fucking mind. Sometimes, when I read shit like that, it makes me wonder if I'm the crazy one. If I'm actually an idiot, if I'm the one who's wrong. How can 3/4 of the whole country be wrong? Does anyone else ever feel this way? Ever feel like maybe you're doing the wrong thing? In my gut, I don't think so. I'm fairly certain that I'm not insane like they say we are. But shit like this makes me doubt myself.</p></p>

        <p>First of all I dont believe the numbers.</p>
<p>Second of all, they initially promoted 70% as the "herd immunity" threshold. But something tells met hey'll move the goalposts.</p>

        <p>They already have moved those goalposts.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin "Blackface" Trudeau said six months ago we needed only 70% of the population to get vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity.</p>
<p>Now in Canada, we're at 80%.  And now they are introducing vaccine passports in many parts of Canada.  </p>
<p>They want it to be 100%, so we won't be able to recognize the vaccine doesn't work, and that won't be able to recognize the long-term side effects when people start developing issues a few months/years down the road.</p>

<p>This is exactly why proper medical trials have a "control group" who live a similar life but are not given the actual drug.</p>

        <p>Agreed.  <br>
I dont even buy the need for "emergency use authorisation" for it as a 99.9% survival rate doesnt seem like an emergency to me.  </p>
<p>There is an anthrax vaccine which was granted EUA back in  2005.   I see terrorists with anthrax as an emergency, first responders for that type of thing might need it in an emergency, but cirtainly not the entire population.  Anthrax is very deadly, covid is &lt;.1% deadly.</p>

        <p>Forget about the vaccine, just learn history. Many big events happened because a minority, sometimes an extreme minority, didn’t follow the majority. Take a look also at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum</p>

        <p>This isn't about wrong and right my man. It's about personal choice, what choice is better for your health. That's why doctors matter so much and the government shouldn't be pushing medical procedures and censoring certain doctors. The only thing truly wrong with what is going on is the governments actions and ignorance.</p>

        <p>This is how I feel as well. If those numbers are correct and 70% of folks want the jab, good for them. If you don’t want it, that’s your choice that you’ve made for yourself. The issue here is that the powers that be are now trying to make you do something you don’t want to do it, to your own body no less.</p>

        <p>Absolutely and it is clearly a power grab going world wide. The fact that certain doctors are being censored is also a very wrong and scary thing going on. That is what I will fight for. If people want an experimental injection with no long term safety that is YOUR choice! That is the best part, you get to choose.</p>
<p>I will stand up and fight the minute they truly try to take that. Idk how to fight the censoring yet but I am trying to think of conventional ways to make it more obvious to the population. They take your freedoms slowly but they take them and never give them back.</p>

        <p>First off, numbers like that are a part of the propaganda to make you feel the way you do right now. Making you feel isolated, alone in your thoughts &amp; beliefs, and man’s desire to “belong” are all powerful tools that have been used historically and currently as psychological manipulation for compliance. Recognize it, rise above it, and turn off the TV. There are millions of us out there. </p>
<p>Second, are you making a mistake about what exactly? Not taking a supposed preventive measure for a supposed disease with a 99%+ survival rate? </p>
<p>Lastly, you’re forgetting that the majority of human beings are not very bright. Most have herd mentality and do things so they can feel like they belong. Most lack critical thinking skills and deductive reasoning. Their reality is literally formed by the things they’re told on TV or by their friends. So even if the 70% number is true, that’s pretty great news because it would mean that there is potentially way more of us out there than originally thought. Maybe 30% instead of 5% or 10%</p>

        <p>Sometimes I think the same way. I think that it is always good to doubt yourself. If I, for example, was 100% set in my beliefs and not willing to move an inch, how is that much different from the folks we disagree with?</p>

        <p>I asked my partner that yesterday?  Are we wrong?  I still feel in my gut I’m not.  There’s this article out of the UK where some doctors admit that the vaccine not holding up to Delta is proof that may not be the ONLY way to her immunity. </p>

        <p>It's 50% fully vaxxed right now, is the 70% one shot/two shots, 18+ or 12+ ? Also, it's a projection based on trends, they scared a lot of people recently and are now using the bump to convince more people that they are a dumb minority and need to get the vaccine. It's all propoganda. </p>
<p>If you think this is bad or unusual look at prohibition in the US in 1920's, they even made that a constitutional amendment! Prohibition lasted 13 years! </p>
<p>At least we aren't at those levels, we just need to resist. The majority of people in the US don't agree with mandating vaccinations, if they did we would have actual laws by now, these are largely localized outspoken minorities and they need to be reminded that most people don't agree with them.</p>

        <p>I'm in Canada.. which has one of highest vaccine rates, 80%. </p>
<p>I know how you are feeling, I feel it too sometimes.. </p>
<p>But then I talk to people who've had the vaccine and hear their reasoning why:</p>
<p>I had to because of work.</p>
<p>I have to travel and I'll need it to travel.</p>
<p>I didn't want to but I felt pressured because everyone else got it.</p>
<p>My family made me.</p>
<p>I just want things to go back to normal.</p>
<p>These reasons don't sound like they're coming from people who love their decision.. are proud of it.. I'm never hearing reasons like "to save lives!" Unless it's coming from a troll on reddit and tbh, I don't even know if they are real, they could be a bot for all I know..</p>
<p>What this all sounds like is they were bullied one way or another into doing something they weren't sure about because God forbid we proceed with caution.</p>
<p>I know we are surrounded by media promoting these numbers that seem like so many people are vaccinated, believe in it, are happy with their decision.. but if that were the case, I'd see it in real life around me, and that's just not the case.</p>
<p>I only know 1 person who is crazy for the vaccine. She bullied her entire family.. who happen to be my in-laws, into getting it. This includes my fiance. I question her motives too tbh.. she focuses on going to restaurants, traveling, getting back to "normal"..  I'm never hearing "because it works!"</p>
<p>And all I got to say is, if its so great and such an easy, smart decision, why do you gotta bully and THREATEN people to take it?</p>

        <p>I’m glad you mentioned this. </p>
<p>I’m also in the U.K.  The other day I <strong>merely floated</strong> the idea, to a few people, that maybe, just maybe, what if the uptake numbers aren’t correct? What if they’re being used as a sort of peer pressure? Of course, the idea was shut down, because people don’t want to even consider the possibility, even if it’s minute, that the media is capable of lying. </p>
<p>After all, a great way of getting people to do something is to convince them that everyone else is doing it, that they’re in the minority. Then you experience feelings like the ones /u/MrNameGuySir speaks about. You start to doubt yourself again. You start thinking about just getting the jab and maybe being one of the lucky ones who won’t experience any side effects. </p>
<p>Or you start to wonder about how shit might hit the fan when everyone around you finds out you’re unvaccinated - there’s all sorts of heavy feelings. </p>
<p>How do we know for sure that 90% is the true uptake rate? Isn’t it possible that a government that is capable of covering up death numbers and choosing not to report on mass protests taking place around the world, is also capable of lying about uptake numbers in order to pressurise everyone into getting it? </p>
<p>It’s just simple linear thinking 😂. Try saying this to anyone however and you’ll get poo-poo’ed. </p>
<p>I’m also still of the opinion that Boris wasn’t in hospital due to Covid way back when. Again, showing me a picture of the outside of a hospital, does not mean that he’s 100% in there. You haven’t shown me he is, you’ve just told me. He may or may not be. He’s Schroedinger’s Boris. 😂 </p>
<p>Serious question - am I crazy for thinking like this?</p>

        <p>I admit that this is a broken way of looking at things, but I pay attention to comments, either here or on YouTube. On Reddit I’ve noticed the majority seem to be pro-Covid vax. Yes there are probably a lot of bots. </p>
<p>YouTube is where it gets interesting. It could be the channels that I’m watching, but the comments are very often leaning in the opposite direction. Channels like TalkRadio hold polls and they sharply lean against the direction we’re heading in. Sky News posts a story that is pro-narrative and the comments are full of dissenting comments, and so on. </p>
<p>I’m aware it’s a broken way of gathering information 😂. But for a general idea I don’t think it’s the worst thing to do, as long as you’re aware of the existence of bots and whatnot, as well as of who you’re consuming content from.</p>
