        <p>well we've had pregnancy tests for women of child bearing age at the hospital/doctor since they were invented because of insurance and liability or whatever, so i'm used to being a second class citizen by now. clearly a potential fetus is way more important than my painful UTI, but you're right, let's make this even more uncomfortable and difficult!</p>
<p>(for the record i completely understand why hospitals do this, especially now as i'm trying to get pregnant, because no one wants to harm a fetus in utero inadvertently, but my god is it an infantilizing and annoying question. the first priority should be to help the woman. anyway, i'm sorry about the moralizing.)</p>
<p>it's going to be a rude awakening for adult men who have never been treated like children, though.</p>

        <p>I've never been asked to take a pregnancy test, but I'm also not ever allowed in the x-ray room.</p>
<p>I'm surprised that people don't draw the parallel here. This is what the end of our medical freedoms looks like, and men don't have have to take prostate exams for travel, so yeah, maybe since it doesn't effect them they won't be advocating very strongly for medical freedoms. </p>
<p>There are plenty of male anti abortion activists however, so they do peripheral have an interest in our anatomy.</p>

        <p>i mean, doesn't your dentist ask you every year (or whenever) when you go in for your dental exam if you're knocked up before the x-rays? now i just make a note on the patient form when my last period was.</p>
<p>it's very weird now, because we're trying to get pregnant, so when i go in for biannual bloodwork, they just give me a pregnancy test anyway, just in case. it's good now - because we want a baby - but always made me a little uncomfortable answering that question before.</p>
<p>when i studied abroad in Russia in grad school, i had to take an HIV test when i applied for my student visa - they gave me a pregnancy test then, too! smh.</p>
<p>anyway, the only time it really became an issue for me was when i had a fairly serious procedure done several years ago - i had an anal fissure and needed a complete lateral sphincterotomy. i thought it was just some raging hemorrhoids, but it turned out that i tore myself a new asshole.</p>
<p>i was bleeding uncontrollably and in such enormous pain that i passed out in my shower, had to call my parents, and my dad left work and picked me up from my apartment, wrapped me in a quilt, and took me directly to the doctor. i could barely string two sentences together, and i begged them to let my father stay in the room because i needed someone to advocate for me - just fix the damn thing! </p>
<p>the nurse wouldn't even let me see the doctor until i agreed to take a pregnancy test, and i kept telling them i hadn't had sex in months, and my father was livid. he kept asking if they treat all women this way before every procedure, and the nurse was like "why yes, of course." i mean, he was FURIOUS, pacing in that small room while i was curled up on the bed crying. "SHE'S BLEEDING!" he shouted. "but if there's a baby, i'm not sure what the surgeons can do," the nurse replied. "WHO CARES ABOUT A BABY, THAT'S NOT WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED RIGHT NOW!" never have i ever seen my dad be such a passionate pro-choice advocate! </p>
<p>i somehow managed to wee in a cup because i was too weak to argue about it and i knew i wasn't knocked up. (also, super awkward peeing in a cup with your dad guarding the bathroom door.) </p>
<p>the doctor called in the surgeon and the surgeon was great - he cracked jokes, he made light of it, and asked me, "now kiddo, did you get this the fun way?" (anal sex.) and i laughed (even though laughing hurt) and said, "nope, didn't do this the fun way." (i did it the stressful way - i.e. stress and diet and lack of sleep.) and the good doctor chortled, "yeah well if you did it the fun way and told 'em that, they wouldn't have made you take a pregnancy test!" </p>
<p>my surgeon was amazing - i think he retired just a couple of years ago, but he was really the best surgeon i could have asked for. fantastic bedside manner, so very positive, and for a large man, he had very gentle hands and did very careful work. he saved my ass, literally.</p>
<p>after getting a whole new asshole put in, i recovered in two weeks and i never felt better. i also highly recommend getting a colonoscopy if you can - it really gave me peace of mind that i didn't have anything rogue going on in my bowels, and just really flushed me out! (my grandmother had colon cancer before she passed away, so i'm in at risk group, and i can get a colonoscopy every 5-10 years. be aware of your family history, you guys, and if it becomes hard to poop or it feels like you have the hemorrhoids from hell, please go to the doctor! also please eat your fruits and veggies, and stay regular! this is the one health care-related issue i feel qualified to harp on!)</p>
<p>also fuck those anti-abortion activists straight to hell, man. if you don't want to have an abortion, don't get one. my body, my choice. instead of harassing women at clinics, why don't you hand out birth control and get out the message about sexual health? why don't you advocate for reproductive policies that benefit women and children, and also men? why are you afraid of sex ed? these men are just really afraid of women, and the power that we have over childbirth and life. they're just envious and want to control that ability. they've always been intimidated by us. losers.</p>

        <p>I'm glad your trouble in your butt got cleared up. Sounds painful. I can't agree with you on getting a colonoscopy, I have a relative who almost died because they got an antibiotic resistant infection from their routine screening.
Anti-Abortion activists are a funny bunch. They think they are protesting the glad-handing eugenicists handing out abortions like candy, but they're supporting the eugenicists by protesting medical freedoms and the same abortion mongers will be right there handing out birth control and other sterilization measures. Good luck with yourself getting pregnant. It can take a while for birth control to 'wear off' but once it does, you'll likely have a real van load of precious heathen :)</p>
<p>I am very curious to hear that Russia required you to take an HIV test before traveling there. That's a PCR no? Fascinating that PCR tests for travel were spearheaded by the Russians. With their history with Stasi and Communism, this whole 'health emergency' has got their paw prints all over it. Thanks Ivanka! Ivanka buy a third party president?</p>
<p>Don't be fooled, the women subjected to sexual violence on the tarmac would not have been examined if not for Coronavirus travel restrictions. This is new. and it's a secondary effect of losing all of our medical freedoms. No doubt the pussy hat crowd won't make the connection and will proudly march to vote for Biden, thinking that will improve medical freedoms. Silly, silly, women.</p>

        <p>The problem with discriminatory government policies is that they effect vulnerable people more than they do others. </p>
<p>Men don't risk sexual assault through medical tests, unless you get a prostate exam or colonoscopy, but those exams haven't been used as tools of oppression. Virginity exams and other non-consensual acts of obstetric violence are part of the dark side of women's history, when we talk 'feminism' sometimes it means equal pay, but really, it's the beginning of medical freedom for women. Freedom from diagnosis of hysteria and freedom from non-consensual vaginal exams for travel.</p>
<p>Covid-1984 absolutely does effect women more. We've lost more jobs, and we've lost stability and education for our children.</p>
<p>You need to be willing to point out how government policy plays out among different genders, races and classes. It's called analysis.</p>
