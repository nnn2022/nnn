    <strong>Big law consensus around vaccine mandates</strong>
    <p><p>Last fall, as vaccines were about to be approved, my friend received a blizzard of emails from law firms that typically want his business.  They stated that vaccine mandates were legal, and employers could force employees to get jabbed.  He didn't mention much about this until just now that he received a flurry of emails again this week.  Like last fall, the laws firm, mostly NYC based, stated that vaccine mandates were legal.  My friend is the principal of a small private equity shop so he doesn't get direct access unless he wants to shell out money he doesn't want to spend.  However, Disney and Walmart just announced mandatory vaccines for some workers.  My guess is that this was due to consulting with various legal sources.  The implication of all this is that our elites have decided that mandatory vaccines are needed, and big law has coalesced around a consensus on this issue.  If big law is behind this, then it wouldn't be out of the question to say most of the legal system will fall in line.  In other words, don't anticipate of getting any legal relief.</p></p>
