    <strong>Grandfather just 180'd on me</strong>
    <p><p>Been talking with my grandfather who was a former professor regarding vaccines, worldwide protests, actual death rates, comparing how Sweden is faring vs say Canada or USA. I only ever provided credible sources from actual real doctors and not once did I share anything with him without one. He was starting to question things with the sources I was providing.</p>
<p>Started having lively discussions on why the media isn't reporting certain things whereas the CDC has openly adjusted/mentioned and other data released by academics. I had to go on a trip which lasted a week and wasn't in contact with him.</p>
<p>When I spoke with him today and mentioned the mass protests undergoing worldwide (again) he completely 180'd on everything including all the doctors and academics I shared previously. Started saying how the internet is untrustworthy and the media is the only source of information he will now listen to. Saying if there were hundreds of thousands of people protesting worldwide the news would certainly be covering it. Saying the doctors who have received threats to their families are just people with agendas wanting to promote themselves. I didn't know what to say just; he completely forgot the questioning and curiosity of perhaps the media is censoring certain things. Still don't know wtf just happened; started getting angry with me and saying he wishes not to discuss these things anymore where I always just provided sources on every single article/video I sent but as soon as I mentioned the worldwide protests and their apparent numbers he said that Trump showed he had great rallies and then there were photos where they weren't so great so now all the streams that are displaying these protests he now considers them to be fabricated.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anyways, rant over. He's apart of this group called the "Doubting Thomas's" so I guess it shouldn't surprise me he would err on the side of seeing is believing but the complete 180 was a surprise.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I showed him the authorization of propaganda by Obama in 2013 and he just said "huh, wonder why they did that". Came so close to realisation but there's something very potent happening to peoples psyches to prevent them from connecting the dots. Cognitive dissonance comes to mind; could be just that but I'm not knowledgeable enough to spend any other guesses.</p>

        <p>I've seen it happen to people I know.  It's not as if the government and media have suddenly become trustworthy to a fault and have earned such sway over people.  I think it's more like mass brainwashing, in a pod people kind of way that they all think the same way, or more accurately don't truly think anymore. They transferred individual thought over to authority and are content to be "told" what the "facts" are rather than determining their own truth for themselves.  I find the whole situation horrifying.</p>

        <p>Very well could be the case. He did mention that the Nazi's used the same media (being used today) efforts in the 30s which led to the atrocities committed; but I haven't looked into that too much.</p>

        <p>your grandfather was living a comfortable upper class lifestyle (as a professor) in a safe country. of course his perspective about the government benevolence is skewed compared to someone who grew up in working class or communist state and already have distrust in government;</p>
<p>coupled with the fact that the legacy media (cnn/nyt/wp etc) of the past is not the same as they are today, but your grandfather is decoupled from that reality because of his experience with the internet (or lack thereof)..</p>
<p>it's not hard to understand where he's coming from. if you truly wanna open him up it's best to introduce him to someone of different background (working class elderly who had to deal with unfairness or people coming from actual authoritarian regime like cuba/vietnam/venezuela etc). this is the only time when i do think diversity is better.</p>

        <p>Oh, sorry I can see how it could be misconstrued that I was saying he was a medical professor; he was in a non-medical field. I'll fix that right now. But yes, introducing him to others would be a great idea but not too feasible as there aren't many people with different backgrounds where he resides. Feel his mind is made up now I just don't really understand how he could flip completely after entertaining the thought for months.</p>

        <p>well in that case i think its best to let him live as is. </p>
<p>he only consumes media one way so when cdc/cnn or whatever is up an ante on fear mongering of course he'll change his mind unless exposed to other authentic figures. you dont count because he probably thinks he knows better than you due to old age. someone else in real life like doctor with opposing opinion or minority who aren't democrat etc.</p>
<p>let him believe the gov and propaganda. he'll either come thru or forever lost. just make sure you do the right thing and dont treat him wrong. we, the rational beast of this mad world, are on the right side of history, so dont take the wrong action toward anyone let alone family.</p>

        <p>Well, as a grandfather, his risk is higher and his personal calculus would be more inclined to favor vaccination.  Plus, he is not wrong about the internet, it used to be called the information super highway, now it's more like the information sewer.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, that's why as I mentioned in my post that I only provided sources from accredited doctors and people who have spent their careers in topic-related fields. I wasn't trying to dissuade him from getting the injections; he has already received them. The discussion was regarding how the media is censoring, propagandising and manipulating statistics for control.</p>

        <p>Understandably, your grandfather is trying to remain aloof, detached and "neutral." The urge to do so is enticing given what it is and where it seems to be going. </p>
<p>Thing is, it's a position that is untenable. They have seen to that. A definitive side is inevitable, it is only a matter of time. </p>
<p>Exercise patience without boundaries and love him wholly. They want us - require us  - divided for their evil success to be realized.</p>
