    <strong>"Rules for thee but not for me" in the Netherlands. Minister has to apologize for breaking social distancing rule she himself has to enforce.</strong>
    <p><p>One of our top ministers in charge of handling COVID got caught breaking social distancing rules that both he and our Minister President keep hammering the general public.</p>
<p>Minister Grapperhaus is our Minster for Justice and Safety, so he's been pretty closely connected to everything where it concerns COVID. The Ministry he runs is in charge of giving people fines for breaking Corona rules.</p>
<p>Now he got married this past week (for which I congratulate him, many people in this country have had to postpone their wedding) and it was very obvious immediately after that he and many guests broke social distancing rules at the wedding. Since he was not "caught in the act" he did not have to pay a fine for breaking the rules. He did make a donation to the Red Cross of 390 Euros, the amount he should have been fined, to "ease his conscience and profess his regret"</p>

<p>Currently the whole country is laughing it's ass off cause he's the one who has been hammering us to follow the rules, and now he's breaking them seemingly without consequence. His position and credibility have been called under scrutiny many times over. To such an extent that the Minister President had to come out and say he still thinks Grapperhaus is credible. The country, understandably, disagrees.</p>
<p>A fellow Minster of Grapperhaus admitted that "It's hard to make sure it [the social distance] goes right all the time at an event like a wedding", which is something we've been saying all along. Keeping social distance is hard. Even those who really really try, like I presume Grapperhaus would, wíll fail at some point. Cause it's hard. Fining people for failing to distance is bullshit.</p>
<p>Similarly earlier in the same week our King and Queen (universally loved by all in the Netherlands) who were on holiday in Greece with their family were also photographed standing right next to people in a restaurant and similarly had to grovel and apologize for breaking social distancing rules.They kinda sorta got away with it after an apology cause we all love them so bloody much, but Grapperhaus has no such luck.</p>
<p>With two separate events of such public figures blatantly breaking the rules the whole country is just laughing at the BOA's [Buitengewoon Opsporings Ambtenaar "Special searching agents" (basically low-tier half-cops)] who are supposed to give out fines. In the days after the wedding photos became public people who were fined understandably challenged the BOA's who tried giving fines. By now the BOA's have decided to, at least temporarily, stop giving many fines. The BOA's themselves are pissed off. They already got a lot of flak and resistance from people, who naturally don't like getting fines. Now the BOA's say "this has damaged our credibility by association". <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2346199-boa-s-houden-boetes-op-zak-vanwege-coronamisstap-grapperhaus.html">BOA's are pissed</a></p>
<p>The press has been really hard on our Minster President too. With some journalists almost literally asking "rules for us but not for him apparently?" Some literally asking "what is even left of Minster Grapperhaus' credibility" Rutte basically answered: "grapperhaus recognizes he has made a mistake and profess his regret" to which a journalist cleverly said "Well many dutch people say they are sorry and regret it if they are caught not social distancing, but they still have to pay a fine. Does that mean fines are off the table from now on?" And what ensued I can only describe as uncomfortable twisting by the Minister President to make it sound like the rules made any sense. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNn993MY6pc">Uncomfortable twisting by the Minster President</a></p>
<p>It's all falling apart and I'm loving it.</p></p>

        <p>They know their rules are rubbish, but continue to make them in order to look like they're trying to do something because they believe it benefits their political career.</p>

        <p>It‘s the same in every country. In Austria they want us to wear masks and during their press conferences there is like one out of 12 people wearing one while they are literally sitting next to each other.</p>
<p>These measures are nothing but a fucking placebo effect.</p>

        <p>I think our king is quite woke too. As his speech om 4th of may explicitly warned against normalizing that which should not be normal, snitching on people and having no tolerance in a time of snitching and the new normal.</p>
<p>Also when he joked about covid being a hoax at the photo op.</p>
<p>He obviously did not mean it seriously. But he does not think covid is something you can't relativize or make a joke about.</p>
