        <p>Technically it's not a vaccine, it's gene therapy, so it's not covered under immunity. But they're trying very hard to get the definition changed to include it.</p>

        <p>The side benefit to all of this is that because it is experimental and only approved for emergency use, it cannot be mandated. </p>

        <p>You can't be forced to but:</p>
<ol>
<li>When have laws applied to the elite/politicians?</li>
<li>There are not enough people that understand the greater picture of this </li>
<li>You'll be barred from just about everything (clubs, airports, sports games, possibly work) </li>

<p>There are so many more but we are already seeing it happen. Only vaccinated healthcare workers were allowed to attend the Superbowl</p>

        <p>An aside about the Super Bowl: for many years, pretty much only connected people got seats. The two teams playing get to split 35% of the tickets, the NFL gets 25% to give to its corporate sponsors, the host team gets a small percentage, the other teams get their bit, and a very limited amount actually goes up for sale at face value. Average football fans have always had to accept that if they don't win tickets, they'll be watching on TV. </p>
<p>The state governments are not going to risk turning this into a universal mandate for a number of reasons. The largest reason is that someone would do as Henning Jacobson did in the early 1900s: refused the smallpox vaccine and refused to pay the resulting fine Massachusetts levied against him. The case went to the Supreme Court, and they ruled that states were permitted to mandate vaccines. (Technically, all that meant was that he was forced to pay the fine for refusing it.) If a case like this goes before the current Court, it stands an excellent chance of being reversed.</p>
<p>Now imagine that the only people who could refuse to sign their rights away are those wealthy enough to pay any fine, to hire private aircraft, and don't need to work a job. Imagine the black market in faked credentials, or doctors making a buck on the side signing that they did in fact inject patients with the vaccine when they didn't.</p>
<p>The only mandate I fear is when the FDA decides that enough research has been done and it's now safe for children. I'm just glad my own children are grown and can make the choice for themselves.</p>

        <p>I hope your right but I don't see it. I have not seen one negative report on the vaccine yet (on the MSM) which I think has a big impact on what the higher courts do</p>
