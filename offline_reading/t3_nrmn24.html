    <strong>This was going to be a comment but it's over 10k characters (whoops)</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys: I'm someone who's followed the guidelines and has gotten my first dose of mRNA vaccine and while I fully expect to get downvoted to h-e-double-hockey-sticks and back, I just wanted to share my thoughts behind it because I find that whenever there's an interaction between the two sides it's not exactly the most civil.</p>
<p>First off, I want to say that I totally understand people's reluctance to get the mRNA vaccine.  It did get developed really quickly and this is the first mass-produced human available mRNA vaccine and that's a big and scary thing.  <em>For me, and in my personal opinion</em>, I feel that the benefits of it outweigh the potential risks.  I should note that for me the benefits are not the reduced chances of death (a topic that's been beaten like a dead horse) but instead the nearly-eliminated risk of hospitalization and what's come to be known as "Long Covid" because we don't have another term for it yet.  Reduced lung function, cardiovascular issues, 'covid haze' with memory and cognition problems--those things are scary as hell.  I work in administration and am preparing to be a teacher: losing cognition is not good for either of those.  At the beginning of 2020 I was finally getting in shape after years of letting myself go; six months of personal training to drop 10kg (22lbs) and a lot more size than would be apparent from the weight.</p>
<p>When COVID first hit, I was living in Korea (I am now back in Canada where I've been since last August).  In contrast to the somewhat casual attitude of the US, Canada and Europe, Korea was very early to restrict flights from China and broadly (even without a mandate) mask wearing became even more common than before.  Korea has a problem with microdust--extremely small particles that are blown over from China in an annual pattern owing to weather patterns.  As a result, mask wearing is something of a necessity during that season, and it's something of a cultural norm to wear a mask when feeling ill anyhow to make sure that one's spittle doesn't contaminate the air with whatever they're sick with.</p>
<p>Korea was doing a great job with &lt;200 cases nationwide until a church group in one of the major cities held their normal worship with zero restrictions--this church has all their congregants sit literally shoulder-to-shoulder which in the case of a virus like COVID makes it very easy to transmit (proximity, enclosed spaces, limited ventilation) and it kind of exploded.  An interesting summary can be found <a href="https://www.vox.com/22380161/south-korea-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-contact-tracing-testing">here</a> if you're interested.</p>
<p>Korea, unlike Canada, the US and Europe, was hit hard by MERS and as a result had policies and laws updated.  If a person tests COVID positive, a message will go out to people living in their suburb (the term is 동 or 'dong', which is a city subdivision; bigger than a neighbourhood but smaller than a city, and typically divided N/S/E/W except in the larger cities which will have named 동 as the city expands) saying "Male/Female, in their [20s/30s/40s] living on [3000 block, street] tested positive for COVID, test done X date AM/PM, test results confirmed Y date [time]."  This is in addition to sending messages where people were confirmed positive and were in places where the public would easily gather between the time they took their test and the positive result came back.  This resulted in a level of caution from people as they kept being reminded that there was a problem.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Korean people will use masks rated KF94: a rating that was developed in Korea and filters 94% of particulate.  <em>In my experience</em> many of these masks will also have a thin plastic layer directly in front of the mouth to prevent the mask from moistening and also to prevent moist air escaping.  <em>From what I have gathered</em> the virus can escape along with air particles, however the majority of viral load comes from the moisture that escapes from our mouths as we breathe and speak--basically spittle.  Masks are good for trapping this.</p>
<p>Now, one of the more common themes I've seen are "but these blue paper masks are trash!", to which I heartily say <strong><em>YES THEY ARE TRASH AND IT BOTHERS ME THAT PEOPLE ARE USING THEM.</em></strong>  At the beginning when we were in an extreme shortage of any kind of masks I totally get why people were using them.  But we're past that now.  My family in Korea tells me about news of mask makers having an oversupply and no market...which is stupid because those masks work well and were not particularly expensive.  If you bought a single from a grocery store it was still less than $2 (CAD!) and multipacks brought the cost down to about 50c each.</p>
<p>"If the masks are contagious, where are the biohazard bins?!" GOOD FUCKING QUESTION.   As with most things, people have been thinking about the takeoff and just COMPLETELY bombing on the landing.  Like, for one: are we just leaving potentially contaminated garbage out so that it can contaminate other things and the air?  WTF y'all.  Two: are we forgetting that the people who have to clean up that garbage are...y'know, people?  Reminds me of a story a friend of mine shared; we used to be coworkers at the Green Circle Coffee Shop, and she still works there.  One day at open (\~5am), soon after corporate introduced the mask mandate someone came in without a mask.  My friend asked them to put a mask on.  The customer looked around, saw that there were no other customers and said, "Why? There's nobody else in here", as though the people who were working were not people.  Bothered me so much.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Time for a bit of Q&amp;A in advance:</p>
<p><strong>Do I think that wearing a mask will prevent me from getting COVID?</strong></p>
<p>No. But if I'm wearing a mask it will reduce the chances of me inhaling spittle and other particulate that could potentially have a higher viral load and lead to a successful infection.  My mask will also prevent my particulate from getting out so just in case I somehow got it, it's gonna limit the spread.  More masks? Mo' betta. <em>In my opinion.</em>  That having been said, not everyone can wear masks.  I have a friend who has PTSD owing to a traumatic incident. She cannot wear a mask.  I totally sympathize with her, but she's been doing well with curbside pickup and the occasional dropoff by friends.  I feel for her and everyone else who can't wear a mask--it sucks getting the evil eye.</p>
<p><strong>Do I think that the dangers of COVID have been overblown?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and no.  Canada and the US were both lucky enough to mostly escape from SARS and MERS unscathed--Asia was not so lucky.  I have lots of friends and family there and those viruses were not fun.  SARS and MERS though didn't jump from person to person as easily <em>and</em> the incubation period was relatively short.  While statistics say it's not common to spread asymptomatically these reports rely on people remembering when they first experienced symptoms.  A friend of mine who got COVID (and luckily escaped mostly unscathed) first thought his symptoms were allergies and so went about his life for the first two days, until day three when he realized he couldn't smell what he was cooking.  Some people never get to the stage where they lose their sense of smell, some people just get a sore throat, or the sniffles or feel lethargic for a day or two and go about their lives.  COVID is a relatively new SARS-variant strain and we've spent so much time figuring out how to beat it that I just don't think it's been studied enough for us to know whether or not it's been overblown.  In another 5 years when we can use hindsight we'll know how bad things are.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about lockdowns and restrictions on freedom?</strong></p>
<p>Again, if I were to contrast my experience in Korea with the situation here in Canada, I would say that there has been no lockdown here.  When COVID hit the major city of Daegu pretty much everything just shut down.  You could go to the grocery store and a few other essential things but the city just died.  Two weeks of no church, no school, no office work...and it cut the cases enormously.  My Aunt lives in Australia where they've had very strict restrictions on mobility--checkins everywhere, limits on how far you can travel from your home, etc etc.  I haven't seen anything like that here in Canada and their case counts are crazy low.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you get the vaccine if you can still get the virus and you can still pass it on?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, it reduces my chances of being hospitalized hugely.  From what I learned in school and what I've gleaned over time, no vaccine is 100% effective at preventing you from getting sick.  The theory is (was?) that if you reduce everyone's chances of infection the virus will not be able to jump to as many people and will die off because it can't find any suitable hosts.  Viral cancel culture?  I might use that.  I for one believe in the efficacy of vaccines--one of our former Prime Ministers, Jean Chretien had polio as a child but by the time I was a child and he was Prime Minister Polio had been eliminated.  My wife needed to have a Tuberculosis jab as a child but I didn't...because vaccines had eliminated it in Canada, but not in Korea when she was growing up.</p>
<p><strong>Aren't you afraid of side effects? Don't you worry that it'll do something to your DNA?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I'm afraid of side effects.  No, I'm not worried it'll do something to my DNA.  mRNA is one of the body's messengers: it's plans or a map for how to build something.  <em>As I understand it</em> mRNA is <em>technically</em> genetic as it uses genetic markers, but it does not alter a person's DNA.  The body's own internally produced mRNA is produced by our DNA, but the mRNA vaccines don't even enter the nucleus and so don't interact with the DNA.</p>
<p>I also was recently shown a clip of Bill Burr with Conan O'Brien where he said something that made me laugh. Roughly,</p>
<p>&rt;Really?  They're gonna inject me with something that's gonna kill me off?  Come on.  I'm the one who's doing everything they're saying and they're gonna kill <em>me</em>?  What's the point?  That means they're gonna be left with all the people who hate them and want them out of power.  Nah, I don't buy it.</p>
<p>I'm not always a fan of Bill Burr, but I like his application of Occam's razor.</p>
<p><strong>Do I think that everyone should be forced to vaccinate?</strong></p>
<p>No.  I have some friends who are immunocompromised and have been advised not to take the vaccine.  I also understand peoples' hesitancy in getting a vaccine which has <em>as yet</em> not received approval for use on anything but an emergency basis.</p>
<p>One thing I would ask is this: "When will you feel safe getting the vaccine?"  And if your answer is 'never', then that makes me concerned.  I joined this subreddit not because I want to shitpost or troll or be a dick (although I have been known to be a dick at times), but because it's important to hear all sides of an argument.  People in this sub will often talk about the unreasonableness of the 'vax crowd', but I feel that it's important for both sides to approach each other in good faith.  Ultimately, that's why I'm here and writing this novella.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about vaccine passports?</strong></p>
<p>I think there are issues and barriers to any kind of implementation.  I'm not <em>necessarily opposed</em> but there are some serious issues involving privacy and personal data.  The difficulties of setting up a central database for the entire population essentially prevents the practical use of a <strong>domestic</strong> vaccine passport system that isn't extremely broken right from the start.  In terms of international travel I don't think we're going to be able to avoid some form of vaccination proof or else face quarantine or other punitive measure upon landing.  That's just the nature of international travel.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the recent revelations about the Wuhan Lab?</strong></p>
<p>Hoo boy.  This is gonna be one very spicy take.  When the first accusations were slung that it was released by China (intentionally or not), <em>there was no evidence to support it</em>.  When you say something like "released from a lab" the implication is that it was engineered.  I seem to remember virologists analyzing the virus and its genome and saying things like "We don't see any of the factors that we would normally see in an engineered virus".  This is what I remember the claims being, and while some people talked about it 'escaping', the implications were initially much more malicious.</p>
<p>Now we <em>potentially</em> have evidence that it escaped the lab via infected staff--though I should note that one of the people who wrote the NYT article announcing this was the same guy who wrote the NYT article saying that Saddam Hussein had ordered aluminum tubes to be used in nuclear weapons refinement...I don't know how that guy kept his job.</p>
<p>I am much more willing to say "I don't know" and evaluate all hypotheses that come in as the evidence builds, rather than jump to a conclusion.  <strong>Please understand this does not mean I think China is blameless or not at fault.</strong>  To use a popular internet turn of phrase, there's a lot to unpack here.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible that the lab was researching viruses that could potentially jump to humans in order to figure out how to cure them and that it escaped through negligence.  It is also possible that it escaped through malfeasance.  If it did escape through malfeasance I do wonder why they let it escape in one of their major transport hubs just a few months before the largest holiday in the nation in which literally millions of people travel all across the country in packed trains.</p>
<p>Negligence? Probably.  Malfeasance? Maybe. Engineered? I'll wait for the analysis.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The wrapup</strong></p>
<p><strong>How can you trust scientists? How can you trust statistics? How can you trust the MSM™?</strong></p>
<p>I'm in a bit of a unique position.  I have friends and family across the world, and get to see and hear the messaging they receive and it changes but it's not particularly inconsistent.  Part of the problem is that each nation has a different tolerance threshold for what's acceptable, and particularly in the states with the federal/state gap it makes messaging and things a problem.</p>
<p>People here are so happy to talk about Florida and Texas and you know what? I want research into why COVID isn't a problem there.  I would LOVE IT if there was something environmental that was causing an extreme drop in cases. <em>I WANT TO KNOW WHY</em>.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you've reached the bottom after reading all of this, thank you.  Upvote, downvote, whatever: just thank you for reading.  I would be happy to answer questions and I want to thank you all for raising concerns and being willing to share your thoughts and worries and fears.  It's important to question everything and make sure that you're doing the right thing.</p></p>

        <p>So here's what I've gleaned from my exposure via news articles and the threads here: He had information, was making statements to the public and making contradictory statements in his emails.  That there was inconsistencies and that he wasn't being honest.</p>
<p>As a person living in Korea at the time of the initial outbreak and as a Canadian now nothing he's said has ever impacted me, and to be honest I didn't really pay attention to what he was saying.  While often America is ahead of the curve on things that's not always the case and especially for something like a viral outbreak the communications intended for one audience don't work for another.</p>
<p>The messaging has been inconsistent and shitty in the US, I agree.  But in Korea and in Canada, the messaging has for the most part been steady: wear a mask, maintain social distancing, limit your potential exposures.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know what's going on with Fauci and the CDC and it's all so crazy and complicated it's a hard knot for me to untie.  Adding the different state-level mandates and countermandates to policies is just...man, I feel for my American brethren.</p>

        <p>What I mean by directly, is if he on purpose let that virus out, for creating a "pandemic".
What I mean by indirectly, IF it's true that he is responsible for the Gain of function, to modify that and other virus, from only infect between animals, to also infect humans.
IF... He did support/order Gain of Function, it's so dangerous, and IF it's true, he trusted a third party country to keep the safety and security. And trusted them to not steal any plans/ideas.</p>
<p>And in my mind, if we don't trust the Chinese with a lot of things that's Secret, how do we dare trust them with Bio weapons?</p>

        <p>When it comes to directly, my first question is why?  He's not lacking for job security (he's had that job for how long now?)  Have we seen his stock portfolio go up because he's invested in the drug companies?</p>
<p>When it comes to indirectly, we've now got a lot of ifs.  I and many other people have been seen to be 'dismissive' of the whole released-on-purpose narrative because there wasn't any evidence at the time. I don't know of anyone who said it was impossible, just that there was no evidence.  One of the things we heard virologists say was that "it showed none of the common signs of engineering" which is why then (and still to an extent now) the hypothesis was animal-to-human transmission.  Being leaked from a lab doesn't always mean it was being engineered--it could have been being studied.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I know one way or the other, I am saying that we need more data...but since it started in China the chances of it becoming public are slim to none.</p>
<p>My concern with the indirect hypothesis is threefold.  First, the question above: the motive question. Second, the number of ifs required--that's hypothesis on hypothesis on hypothesis and we don't know if any of them are true individually.  Third, organizationally.  I have worked for a major corporation and ANY kind of coordination needs a LOT of communication and people are fucking TERRIBLE at keeping secrets.  Leaving laptops open, taking printouts home to analyze, forgetting that other people can hear them when they're talking on the phone...how many people would be needed to coordinate this, what are THEIR motives, how and why are THEY involved in this?</p>
<p>There's just too much supposition and not enough research or evidence for me to lean towards the idea that this was planned.  I'm open to having my mind changed, but I need evidence more than supposition.</p>

        <p>A Reddit  auto-Mod deleted this. I think the word "b.anned" was flagged. Or the name of youtube video, so I added ,. here and there.
 I paste my post under this:</p>
<p>" You're not a dumb one, that's apparent ☺</p>
<p>I could write a thesis what my theory is.
But I'm sorry, I don't have time. I'm washing my house and preparing for paint, but if I had time, I would love to. You deserve it with your perfectly good questions.</p>
<p>I would love to spend a few days, emptying my brain, go through my 1000+ bookmarks. 17GB of downloaded videos, PDFs, Podcasts and whatnot since December 2019 about this Plandemic.
Because what you ask isn't simple and short to answer, at least if you want some sources.
And I use 90% of my own free time (family man, full time job, 3 dogs, and a small farm to take care of) to research for my self. Well, 80-90% and some days 10% lurking the forums.</p>
<p>But if I stumble over a few hours free time and I feel like write a small essay, I might.
But I can gladly point you in right direction.
Search this Sub. And other forums for awake people.
Some are banned for even mention here. Some you need an invite to join. Some you stumble over the more you read.
Some forums are totally way out there, but even there you may find some drops of gold.</p>
<p>"Dot win" have some great forums too.
Even YouTube have some good and not b.anned videos these days. 
Maybe find some with Senator P.,aul vs F.,auci?
Start there, and even read comments. Often in comment fields all over, you can find links to other forums to lurk.</p>
<p>Safe travels for now. I have to paint a wall or two now. This write up gave me time for some paint to dry."</p>
<p>It's actually time for a new coat of paint now.</p>

        <p>you seem reasonable and cool.</p>
<p>thanks for organizing your thoughts.</p>
<p>some quick thoughts:
- obesity drastically increases illness severity (79% of hospitalizations or worse are overweight or obese) 
- most severe cases involve pre existing conditions
- risk is age-stratified: avg age of death in developed nations is late 70s/early 80s
- ivermectin, vit d (prevents kawasaki/cytokine storm) and HCQ alone have been demonstrated time and time again to basically cure the illness/severely reduce illness to the point of it being mild or asymptomatic and resolve “long” covid </p>
<p>covid is way overblown for the vast majority of people - if you aren’t super overweight or at the end of your life, and have sufficient vit d, you literally should live life like it’s 2019 with zero changes or “NPIs” whatsoever. </p>
<p>zero.</p>

        <p>Hey, thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it!  I'm 100% behind your first three statements, but just as a lot of people here are concerned with long-term effects of the vaccines and low-incidence blood clot and other side effects, I'm scared of COVID's rare symptoms and long-term effects too.  A friend of mine (fit mother in her late 30s) can now no longer climb up a set of stairs in her house without being winded.  No previous lung infections or breathing issues, fit mother of two daughters.  Scary as hell.</p>
<p>I do remember seeing some papers about vitamin D (thank god the weather's been good lately, been getting plenty of that) but as far as I know the efficacy of HCQ hasn't been confirmed, and while I've seen Ivermectin being approved for emergency use in some nations, I don't remember seeing any papers on its efficacy.  I would be over the goddamned moon if it were effective but until it's proven, doctors here would never prescribe it to treat the virus.</p>
<p>Having gotten my first shot and seeing no serious side effects (except my shoulder felt like it took a puck to it), I am looking forward to returning to a normal life!</p>
<p>Again, thanks for the thoughtful comments.</p>

        <p>I've seen enough people of my ken come in and say "lmao y'all idiots" and that's just a bunch of bullshit.  It's important to engage all sides, especially when things are as divided and partisan as they are today.  I totally agree that it's long-winded, but it's hard to TLDR a concept this big.</p>
<p>Thanks for the comment though!</p>
