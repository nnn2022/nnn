    <strong>How do we return to normal?</strong>
    <p><p>Genuine question here,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">Masks prevent the spread of COVID</a>. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html">Vaccines are also effective at preventing COVID</a>  </p>
<p>According to the University of California San Francisco and the CDC, both masks and vaccines prevent the transmission of COVID.   </p>
<p>But this sub prefers not to wear masks and not get the vaccine so what are your ideas on how we return to normal?  </p>
<p>I'm very curious about your opinions.</p></p>

        <p>Well yes of course. If even 1/3rd of the US completely refused these mandates, they would be unenforceable. Big corporate businesses at the forefront of pushing the mandates would be losing a lot of money. We wouldn’t be where we are. </p>
<p>But yes, it starts with NOT cooperating with mask wearing whilst doing your daily shopping activities.</p>

        <p>You can’t ‘stop’ the spread of covid because you can’t ‘stop’ the spread of Flu. It’s the same virus, but rebranded, so the leaders can impose tyranny under the guise of ‘protecting others’ - ‘we’re all in this together’. </p>
<p>‘Believe in science’ - firstly, science isn’t a belief-based system. It’s based on measurable results. For thousands and thousands of years, humans have acquired quite a fine immune system, through the actual process of receiving viruses and letting their bodies overcome them. For some odd reason, in 2020, going on 2021, going on 2022, we’re being asked to abandon this innate fact of reality, because of course, ‘we’re protecting others’. </p>
<p>It’s all a joke my friend. You can find plenty of sources in this sub - hundreds of researchers and doctors are sharing their concerns every day - some even saying ‘there IS a conspiracy here’.</p>

<p>But we can sure slow it the hell down. Look at Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, and South Korea. All of those countries have less than 1000 new cases each day. Don't you think we can do the same? Unless you think those countries are lying.</p>

        <p>My friend, why does it matter? What actions have we taken as a society to ‘slow’ the spread of the Flu? We don’t. People who <em>want to</em> get the flu shot do, and most don’t. </p>
<p>Have you ever seen 90% of the population wearing face masks to ‘slow the spread’ of the Flu? No! That’s blatant idiocy. That’s exactly why they could get away with it given a fictitious virus. </p>
<p>I assure you, had we just lived normal lives throughout the past year and a half, no one would have a damn clue about a ‘pandemic’, because there <em>is not</em> one.</p>

<p>" Have you ever seen 90% of the population wearing face masks to ‘slow the spread of the Flu?"  </p>
<p>Actually maybe yes, In Asian countries many people there wear a mask when they are sick with anything out of courtesy for other people.  </p>
<p>" I assure you, had we just lived normal lives throughout the past year and a half, no one would have a damn clue about a ‘pandemic’, because there <em>is not</em> one. "  </p>
<p>Well, the definition of a pandemic is a disease that's over a whole country or the world, so you're wrong. And if we did nothing to prevent COVID we would have +100,000,000 deaths. I think people would notice that many people are dying in a short amount of time.</p>

        <p>&rt;Stop calling COVID the flu, it’s not.</p>
<p>That’s a cute opinion piece, but my position stands firm. And why? The CDC has active lawsuits from several research universities because they failed to provide an isolated instance of ‘Covid-19’. </p>
<p>Perhaps I should repeat that - the CDC is being <em>sued</em> for fraud. </p>
<p>Nothing in that article suggests covid-19 is not the flu. “Higher deaths than influenza over the past 5 years”, yeah, perhaps that’s because the rules dictating a covid death span out 30 days after a ‘positive’ covid test. That includes car accidents, stab wounds, heart attacks - marked as ‘covid-19’. </p>
<p>I’m quite astonished that, despite the fact I told you we have a natural immune system for a reason, you’re still debating with me over this. It’s quite silly. </p>
<p>The media is dictating the perception of who knows how many millions, but no matter how many doctors are dressed up and reading off scripts to tell you to stay home and get the covid jab, it doesn’t change the fact that this virus is nothing like they are making it out to be.</p>

        <p>I don’t know why you would bring up more deadly diseases because none of those are at all comparable to covid-19. Even if it was real, then it would be classified as a ‘coronavirus’, which is synonymous with ‘the common cold’. Which, unless you’re morbidly obese or old, you will not be effected from whatsoever. Same thing with the Flu, oddly enough? </p>
<p>So why do you say ‘would you listen to ‘the scientists recommendations’’ when there are scientists telling me not to get the vaccine, or trust these organizations? We’re listening to two different versions of science, and call me a conspiracy theorist, but I’m more inclined to believe the doctors who aren’t being paid to read from a script on national television. </p>
<p>And yes, <a href="https://sharisnyder.wordpress.com/2021/03/16/virologist-sues-cdc-for-covid-fraud/">here you go</a></p>
<p>Not sure what else you have to say after seeing the CDC being pursued for fraud investigations, but I guess we’ll see..</p>

        <p>Do you think ‘false information’ has ever been filtered out of social media on this scale? No. The only reason the content would be getting removed is to keep people like YOURSELF “in the loop” of covid, so you continue to do as they say.</p>
<p>Really, this is incredibly simple. If you can’t understand that, we are super done here. Who’s more likely a conspiracy theorist? The Person ENJOYING their lives, mask free, vaccine free, and healthy, or someone slowly killing themselves by wearing masks by themselves and lining up for an experimental ‘vaccine’? </p>
<p>This is comparable to WW2 Nazi propaganda, on a much larger scale. Your reality is completely inverted, and nothing you say makes any sense.</p>

        <p>Alright, what if we take this convo outside Reddit, like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. Most likely they would find you delusional. </p>
<p>So take this, 99% of the world thinks you're delusional. Don't you think that's a problem? Don't you think there's a reason why 99% of the world is against you? It's because you guys spew misinformation and when you get banned for it, you guys call it censorship when in reality it's saving lives.</p>

No. I’m not the one taking chances with an experimental shot with which there is no liability on behalf of the corrupted big pharmaceutical groups who’ve created them, who’s own CEO’s have said they are “not cutting the line” in regards to their own product. </p>

<p>That's incorrect, or it <em>would</em> be close to that number of deaths.  Instead, the number of deaths is 'only' about 3 million.</p>

        <p>Covid is so mild in young people that they don't even know they have it, right? "Asymptomatic spread"?</p>
<p>The vaccine makes it basically the same for old people right? It doesn't stop the spread, but the old people don't go to the hospital and don't die.</p>
<p>So then, why does it matter anymore? It doesn't affect young people, it doesn't affect old vaccinated people, everyone who is old or immunocompromised has been vaccinated.</p>
<p>If you recall back to the start of the pandemic, the narrative was that everyone was going to get covid at some point, we just needed to stop the hospitals from overflowing.</p>
<p>We did that. <strong>"Zero Covid" is impossible. Eradicating coronavirus from the earth has never been the goal, and is unattainable anyway</strong>.</p>

<p>So you don't trust scientists? So why use their inventions, like the internet?  </p>
<p>Assuming you're on mobile, you just typed that out on a device that's owned by a company that probably knows you more than most people because of all the data collection companies have been doing.  </p>
<p>But you're perfectly fine with that? When Scientists tell you the steps in order to end the pandemic y'all ignore them.  </p>

        <p>India has gotten more than 1 million cases in the past week.<br>
5% of 1,000,000 = is 50,000<br>
That's at least 50,000 needing medical help. Don't you find that disturbing?</p>

        <p>I find it disturbing that India was under lockdowns since March to November of 2020.  No wonder they are seeing such an explosive number of cases.  You don't stop the virus with lockdowns, you just postpone the infection.</p>
<p>I did read that India doctors are pushing <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/ivermectin-to-be-used-for-covid-treatment-in-up-to-replace-hcq/articleshow/77423417.cms">Ivermectin</a> and are seeing better results than hydroxychloroquine and is a lot cheaper than Remdesivir.</p>

        <p>How about letting nature take it's course and learning how to fight the virus the old fashioned way.. you know the way that your body was created to do. Hijacking your dna to fight one specific bug is going to make your body forget how to fight bigs and it's going to make your body reliant on more mRNA injections in order to operate properly.</p>

        <p>This “return to normal” is so odd to me.</p>
<p>Literally nothing in my life has changed since this shit started. Besides my kids having to stay at home for distant learning. Which they’re back full time now.</p>
<p>My wife and I have worked every week since the pandemic. Never worn a mask ANYWHERE I go and have had zero issues. The restaurant/bars I occasionally visit I did takeout from but as soon as they were able to re open we visit them regularly now.</p>
<p>I never stopped visiting friends or family or having groups of people over for bbq’s and beers. </p>
<p>I have treated everyday since this pandemic as a regular day. </p>
<p>THAT IS HOW YOU SHOULD ASWELL.</p>

        <p>If I don't wear a mask in most stores around me they call the cops.  It's trespassing to stay on premises when asked to leave for violating store policy.  I find somewhere else to go, but this isn't normal.  I can't take my kids to museums, loud crowded restaurants or malls, etc.</p>

        <p>Honestly if you want a return to normal live in the sticks like I do. We did the whole 2 weeks at the beginning, saw it was bullshit and went on with life. Sure, some people wear masks and some people have gotten the vaccine but our lone sheriff could give 2 fucks what our Governor thinks and we don't have anyone really taking about it. We have other shit to worry about like our crops, animals, power going out due to high winds recently, etc....</p>
