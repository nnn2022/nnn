        <p>I'll be honest, i didn't believe it at first. I was very skeptical of it, I was actually angry about it, because i thought that it was ridiculous and would only serve to fuck up our credibility. But I have seen it happen in front of my eyes. It happened to my grandma, we were able to stick a car key to a friend's arm, a coworker of mine thought it was bullshit, until we stuck a penny on his arm.</p>
<p>I know it's anecdotal, but i don't give a single shit if it's believed or not. I saw it happen in front of me multiple times.  It's very real and we need to stop not taking this shit seriously.</p>

        <p>An American penny?  American pennies are <a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/130963/why-isnt-the-american-nickel-magnetic">not ferromagnetic</a>.</p>
<p>If the penny was American and was "sticking", it was definitely not due to magnetism and was for some other reason such as friction, or maybe surface tension from skin oils and/or sweet, or maybe even just a tiny amount of a sticky substance applied to it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the three elements that are ferromagnetic at room temperature are: iron, cobalt, and nickel.</p>
<p>Also, just to make sure, you need to try the same 'experiment' on somebody that you know hasn't been vaxxed.  They should preferably have been in the same environment for a while to hopefully have a similar amount of sweet, but people can differ a lot on that.</p>

        <p>Sorry, bad choice of words, it was a european coin, don't remember if it was a 1 Euro or 2 Euro, one of those. I don't know what the metal composition is. I tried on myself and other friends who are not vaxxed and it didn't stick. Nobody was sweating, at least not enough to glue a coin directly on top of the injection zone. He turned his arm with the coin facing down and shook it, it didn't fall so there was no friction causing it to stick. I'l be honest, my gramps got vaxxed and he did NOT have magnetism, but then again, half of the population was given a placebo instead of the real thing, plus he didn't have any side effects, but my grandma did, and she's magnetic.<br>
Look, I understand how ridiculous it sounds, I was also very skeptical about it, and because of my skepticism I didn't just half-ass the experiment. I scrutinized it because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I don't need people to believe me. I know what I saw with my own eyes. And if people are that skeptical like I was, then all I have to say is "Try it yourself".</p>

        <p>Well you can come visit. You're a tourist so you're golden. Our government lets tourists do whatever the fuck they want, because we survive off of tourism. It's the portuguese that can't do shit.</p>
<p>This summer we had lots of English tourists, and it came to the point where they got piss drunk unmasked, shit looked like a wild spring break, next to double masking cops acting like assholes, and nothing happened. The cops would jump on us if we did that.</p>
