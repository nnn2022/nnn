        <p>They are lying when they say that, anyway.</p>
<p>Their intention is to manipulate you into wearing one, too. But the people who say that didn't think of it themselves. Their entire sense of reality is determined by constant hypnotic consumption of TV news, and every phrase out of their mouths is a sound bite or talking point.</p>
<p>You can spot these people quickly because they react with incredible hostility and personal attacks if you attempt to reason with them logically... usually sprinkled with colorful profanity and always closing with the terminal cliche of "JUST WEAR YOUR DAMN MASK."</p>
<p>People get weird when a virus becomes their <em>sense of identity</em>...</p>

        <p>Hello actual psychologist here, you are correct. They are unconscious of primary intention (A), while insisting their premise is secondary intention (B).</p>
<p>Subconsciously these people hate themselves and this manifests as a political position FIRST.</p>

        <p>Nope. As I pointed out already, people working in fast food get hot, sweaty, wet, touch their dirty masks, and then touch the food they're preparing.</p>
<p>Everyone touches their masks. Then they touch things. They reuse dirty masks because they are paid beans for their hard work and yet are expected to buy their own.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they're actually asked to NOT use N95 masks. Instead they are expected to overpay for garbage masks.</p>
<p>This is probably why cases are rising in areas that have incredibly high mask compliance, like San Diego.</p>
<p>But also... The masks are just one part of the abuse. They also lock people inside and stress them out. So they live sedentary lifestyles and overeat. Land of the obese. They order social distance and terrify people, but they don't order exercise. This sets the people up to have worse symptoms when they do get it.</p>
<p>Oh, almost like a for-profit healthcare system actually wants people to be sick because it's so profitable.</p>
<p>But that would be crazy talk, wouldn't it. This country never knowingly gave people HIV infected blood and then sold it to third world countries when they were finally stopped. This country never went to war for profit reasons - Weapons of Mass Destruction were real.</p>
<p>TV news is real, government never lies, and anyone who is skeptical is a dumb Trump supporting idiot anti-vaxxer.</p>
<p>Come on. <em>Think</em>.</p>

        <p>These people don't care about others dying, lol.</p>
<p>They support unnecessary wars when the media tells them to.</p>
<p>They don't hold politicians accountable for wars or drone strikes.</p>
<p>They don't support a national healthcare system. (They just elected and celebrated a guy that spent his entire life fighting against it.)</p>
<p>They love phones and other products that are made by literal slave labor. (Which I wouldn't blame them for except when you really push them, they are against the kind of policies that would actually stop that slave labor.)</p>
<p>They didn't support the fast food workers that tried to get a 15 dollar minimum wage.</p>
<p>And... If you are at all skeptical of TV news or government, they will actually wish painful death on you and your family.</p>
<p>Oh, also - the lockdown is killing people.</p>
<p>So I don't know what to tell you. Yeah, they SAY they care about others but these are the worst people in the world.</p>
<p>In fact, they want to throw away rights and freedoms that others fought for... And they make demands of you and then shame, criticize, name call, and even threaten if you don't agree.</p>
<p>No, they don't care about others. They don't even care enough to spend five minutes thinking and researching what is actually happening. They just support it, and attack others who actually <em>think</em>.</p>

        <p>Her saying that to me would be alarming. Would discuss with my other sister on what I should do. I would personally call her therapist and primary doctor to see if any medicine would cause scudial thoughts like that.  I still would wear my mask in to common places. I have my own worries for my health.
P.s. my older sister doesn't ever wear a mask. My younger sister wear a mask only because she has a newborn. We literally all have a different opinion on wearing a mask.</p>

<p>You suck. In 1984, family member were the majority crowd who reported individuals. You may think asking a therapist "Does medication you recommended give people suicidal thoughts?" is a harmless question but you just informed someone, who has the ability to forcefully remove someone from a home upon their recommendation of commitment, that someone in your home is considering suicide. Even if they ask you if she is having thoughts and you answer no, they have no choice but not to believe you, as why else would you be calling?</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and start actually caring about people instead of pretending to care.</p>

        <p>I am still working on how to reply to others correctly. This was supposed to be in another thread of comments. Where I live it is  harder then you think to get them in a mental health faculty. My grandmother has bipolar which is rough for us to attempt her when she gets her "highs". She has frontal lobe issues from strokes. That is also a problem I run in to when caring for her. She understands the danger at least. Wish things were normal again but it will never be the same.</p>

        <p>Once again, it seems like you are arguing against some absurd straw man.</p>
<p>Most people here aren't debating the basic principle of masks blocking contagious materials from exiting your mouth/nose.  It's more of a question of whether this principal applies to mandating people block mouth/nose exhaust in public at all times.</p>
<p>Could I get sick from somebody passing on a sidewalk?  Very unlikely but if perhaps if they sneezed at the perfect time and the wind was also blowing in the right direction, transmission could occur but this is a laughable possibility compared to the vast majority of how these things are spread.  As I'm sure you know, it's the enclosed spaces with sick people (high viral loads) which are the primary vector.  Not an unmasked "Karen" passing you on the hiking trail.</p>

        <p>Hell, why stop at 35mph – why not just ban vehicles entirely? 100+ people die in car accidents each day in the US. By Cuomo's logic, as long as a just single person is dying in car accidents, we need to completely ban motor vehicles. If you don't support banning vehicles, that means you must want people to die!!!</p>

        <p>Surely you must realize that the risk of the government banning sugar consumption under force of law is "basically non-existent" while the risk of allowing people to consume sugar is diabetes, heart disease, cancer or any of the countless other scientifically proven negative health consequences of sugar consumption. </p>
<p>But apparently unless you're in favor of having the government forcefully put people in prison for consuming sugar, you don't care about any of that. /s</p>

        <p>After all this, I'd prefer a surgeon who didn't wear a surgical mask. They impede breathing and vision. Studies show they don't reduce the risk of infection and might actually increase it, probably because the masks collect bacteria as the day goes on.</p>

        <p>Surgeons wear them to no infect patients while theyre opened up. stop spreadig misinformation that they restrict your breathing and oxygen when theyre known to work. Link these studies youre talking about cuz i can find plenty that prove you wrong. Tf is wrong with you</p>
