    <p><p>Side A believes side B have lost their minds and side B believes side A have lost their minds. Each side spouts the same points ad infinitum, but neither side A or B seem to be moved enough to see the light.</p>
<p>So what would it take for YOU to be convinced you’ve actually been wrong all along?</p></p>

        <p>Real world data proving lockdowns and masks etc have had a visible influence on Covid deaths (or ‘cases’) ,would turn me.
As to the vaccine, for me not taking it is based on my age and health.</p>

        <p>Due to the inconsistencies and lies from the start, I don’t think I could be convinced. From the start, they acted like this respiratory virus acted different than others. Other than being more transmissible, it is the same. Why would they assume different? Why did the entire globe do a marketing campaign saying how dangerous it was instead of calming fears? Why were there videos of people collapsing in the street? Why couldn’t you visit dying loved ones in the hospital? Why did we try lockdowns and masks with no scientific data to prove that would be effective? Why did they decide we needed to wear masks after all the past studies verifying they don’t stop viruses? Why did we pick and choose which businesses to close? Why wasn’t physical exercise and outdoor activities pushed when it was clear that these things drastically improve outcomes? Basically, why did we change science and protocols for ineffective guesses? It’s all too fishy. If it quacks like a duck, you’re not going to convince me it’s a zebra.</p>

        <p>I'll never take it because the "other side" as you so call them is constantly pushing us to take it. Fuck that, they can burn in Hell if they keep that up. If they were absolutely silent, if governments around the world weren't advertising this, if scientists, doctors and nurses who I follow didn't have their YouTube, FB, Twitter accounts banned, and if the news actually performed investigative journalism as opposed to parroting the same talking points with other lame-stream-media outlets, only then I'd keep an open mind. But they burned that bridge A LONG TIME AGO!</p>

        <p>There’s still plenty left to be known on the vaccines that could change my mind on how safe it is. Honestly it is seeming like it’s worth it to take if you are elderly. </p>
<p>I’m not getting the vaccine regardless though. The reason isn’t because of what I know about the vaccine. It’s what is known about the virus. I have no real risk with this thing. I’m relatively young, healthy and in good shape. Get the vaccine if you want, I don’t want. If someone tries to make me get it, they can go fuck themselves.</p>

        <p>It took some of us longer than others to wake up. It's easy when mainstream media is telling you these "conspiracy theorists" are dangerous and stupid. It's easy to not see the lies if you are never looking for them. Human nature is to trust and follow. I was red pilled years ago. My family listened to what I said but never fully believed me. This "pandemic" was enough to push them over the edge and make them start doing their own research. One by one they told me how right I was all these years. People really do need to find it for themselves.</p>

        <p>I have zero confidence that any of the news/information I get is reliable and reliable.  The fact that the entire process and its remedial measures seem to be based on a foundation of lies and deceptive narrative gives me zero confidence in what's being called the "science".</p>

        <p>Nothing will change my mind because of the massive amount contradictions and contraindications.  There are 20% of people in society who are critical thinkers and will not take the jab. There are 30% of people who are slowly waking up to the covid scam. The other 50% are brainless sheep who will always do what they are told by the media and government,</p>

        <p>I agree, but they are presented as if they are binary. There's no option to just "wait and see". If you wait and see, then you're an "anti-vaxx grandma killing conspiracy theorist", if you get the vaccine, then you're a "sheep who can't be saved".

        <p>Simply put, I dont really care what other people do, so long as they don't care what I do. Providing it's not harming anyone else  Obviously, the issue gets complicated when you include that last point, because pro vaxxers believe my choice not to be vaxxed is harmful to others and I believe putting an untested vaccine with unknown side effects into my body is more harmful than me getting the virus itself.   But again, if the vaccine was actually that great it wouldn't require everyone to have it. Grandma could get vaxxed and be protected without me being guilt tripped/bribed with treats lol. </p>
<p>People can reduce their risk of being harmed by Covid by looking after their health. Exercise and healthy eating is a good start. It is not my responsibility to save grandma by injecting experimental drugs into my veins.  All my grandparents are dead, and none of them would expect me to 1) go into lockdown/ put my life on hold, 2) get a vaccine that hasn't been proven to be safe or effective, 3) miss out on job opportunities or go into debt to support myself during lockdown. My awesome grandparents fought for the freedoms that are being pulled away from us piece by piece. They were real hero's and would want life to continue regardless of their "Covid risk". God rest their souls.</p>
<p>Seems that's too much to ask nowa days.</p>

        <p>Real actual factual data.... Lives actually lost from covid..not some other bullshit contributing factor like...had corona 4 months ago but died in the hospital from diabetes later on. Actual long term side effects from the shots which can't be given out right now because it's in a trail phase.. get this vaccine out the right way like past vaccines. And stop making it mandatory, the flu shot isn't mandatory and it's been around forever. If people want it they will get it. We are at that point right now
If people see the effectiveness of the vaccine with little or no know long term side effects they probably will be more willing to take it.. myself included.</p>

        <p>Knowing anyone that has actually died of Covid  , even though I have lost 4 relatives during lockdown due to serious medical issues (stomach cancer, brain tumor, lymph node cancer, mental health issues) they couldn't receive urgent treatment due to Covid lockdowns, died as a result and 2 were logged as Covid Deaths even though they were terminal with friggin' cancer and has no Covid symptoms at all. </p>
<p>My bfs uncle just died a few days ago.... Not long after receiving his first dose of the vaccine. </p>
<p>I look at all of this and can't unsee the ridiculousness. </p>
<p>I would start believing if they put the real Covid death stats (instead of all death's within 28 days of a positive test). And the real death stats post vaccine, instead of completely ignoring it and trying to make it appear like the safest thing ever! Plus all the bribing and freebies with the vaccine make me question it. If it was so good, people would want it because of efficacy and safety, not because they get a free donut and a beer afterwards. </p>
<p>Regardless of all this. I would still take my chances with a virus as opposed to taking a vaccine. I have an immune system for a reason. I just wish the opposing side would respect my body my choice. If the vaccine is so great, they can just get it and leave me be. If it needs everyone to get it to be effective, it isn't a good vaccine and does bugger all.</p>

        <p>Create an attenuated or inactivated whole virus vaccine, prove that it doesn't cause additional problems when someone encounters the wild virus, prove through testing and releasing all data that it's <em>actually</em> safe and it works. Then about 30 years from now if COVID is still around and has mutant strains I can catch, I'll consider getting the shots. That's around when I plan on discussing flu shots with a doctor and may start taking them, depending on available flu therapies, vaccine efficacy, etc.</p>
<p>If it's gene therapy and/or I'm not elderly, no deal.</p>
