    <strong>To the Diaper Faces...I'm curious what has indisputably proved to you that face diapers are a good thing?</strong>
    <p><p>The data shows that covid cases and hospititalizations skyrocketed AFTER face diapers became the norm. Using logical reasoning, one could suspect that putting a germ net on your face to catch bacteria, fungi, pollen, dead cells, gasesous waste and viruses, will just lead to them being inhaled over and over. What ends up on the outside of the face diaper ie. virus particles, WILL end up in your lungs. Dead cells and bacteria can INCREASE the efficiency of viral transmission. The warm moist environment of a face diaper helps the bacteria MULTIPLY. Bacteria causes lung infections that are likely diagnosed as covid. It seems after being aware of these obvious facts, some serious mental gymnastics would be required to believe face diapers aren't harmful. So do you have any thought process other than ignoring and personally attacking the sources of things you may not want to believe?</p>
<p>So, who is more likely to transmit a virus, someone who doesn't have the virus and is face diaper free, or someone who has the virus and is wearing a face diaper? That is an important question with an obvious answer. Since the face diaper increases your risk of CATCHING the virus, in the long run, it is also increasing your risk of TRANSMITTING it.</p></p>

        <p>Because the 'spread' is based on 'positives' which is based on the PCR test which isn't a diagnostic tool at all just like the inventor of it clearly said. We have 'asymptomatic carriers' because the test is not relevant. In fact the test sample doesn't even matter that much. It's the number of tests cycles that determines if the result is positive or not - and again, being positive means nothing.</p>
<p>There is 'spread' when there are a lot of tests being done. No tests -&rt; no spread. If they were interested in real phenomena they would only observe people who are actually sick. Then it could be researched if they infect other people or not. Now they have created this alternate 'reality' where only the test results matter and not people being sick or not. They say something is spreading but only a tiny fraction of the 'positive' people are actually sick.</p>
<p>We have healthy people testing positive all the time. We have the inventor of this test saying it can't be used for diagnostics and that the test doesn't indicate any illness. On the other hand we have people with symptoms of flu and pneumonia and due to the current politics all of those people need to be tested using this method that doesn't say anything about anything. And if the test is positive then it's covid and not pneumonia. But guess what. Covid 'emerged' when they started testing for it. Not that they can test for it, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>The evidence is crystal clear but people aren't interested in that. They just want their fear porn about this novel virus that's out to kill them. If you show them the evidence - which is saying there is no proof for it - they get angry as hell. They rather  want to believe there is this mystery killer out there than that there isn't. That's really interesting don't you think?</p>

<p>Welcome to modern medicine. My girlfriend tried to explain this conundrum by referencing the mammography screenings which lead to thousands of false positives. Few got it. The only one who <em>really</em> understood this was an older woman who went under colonoscopy and almost died because of a prick into the spline. She said this is probably the same thing. The medical expert sitting besides her said no. That was clarifying...<br>
To add to the confusion, they use several assay formulations and one of them works perfectly fine, while still having the Ct-depending sensibility. So if somebody says that they heard there was a problem they can point out to the working parts of the system. See, no problem! </p>
<p>I really hate this.</p>

        <p>Indeed. Everything is backwards and the powers aren't even pretending to be scientific. I mean sure there are a few papers that try to mask the truth but even then it's always hidden in plain sight. </p>
<p>But of course if we somehow manage to survive this 'new normal' and still have some form of a life, then it's going to be useful to have all the new (old) knowledge that this 'pandemic' situation has taught us. I know I wouldn't have learned about how medicine works nor how the human body works had I not had this great motivation to research it. So just in case the powers will spare some of us from their 'medication' and 'treatments' then we have the potential of being much healthier than before.</p>
<p>But then again I think that's the biggest fear the powers have - to let us live and bear testament to the fact that their methods lead to illness while those who chose other options remain healthy.</p>

        <p>Nice to hear and thanks for the reply. I wonder if you know that viral contagion has never been scientifically proven?</p>
<p>I'm not saying these things are real or they are not real. The bottom line is I found it extremely surprising when I learned that they are basically operating on an unproven theory. I mean sure, the theory could still be correct. But one would assume they had been able to prove it correct by now.</p>
<p>I studied this issue for several hundred hours when this whole covid thing began. And I found it really weird that I couldn't find conclusive evidence anywhere. And I don't mean just covid, I mean the whole idea of viral contagion. I still talk to advocates of viral theory every day. And still no scientific evidence. I'm beginning to think the evidence isn't there. Surely by now someone would have been able to provide some.</p>

        <p>Because personally, I received eight masks as a gift with an advert printed on it and I wash them regularly. In summer I wore one for a week, but I only needed it for a few minutes in public transport, then in the store, then again in the transport and then off with it and I placed it into the glaring sun to disinfect.<br>
Others, I don't know. I still think the social dangers of masks are way, way more threatening us than the few, if at all, bacteria on them.</p>

        <p>Yeah maybe, but I don't care about those, since I have a bunch of masks which are practically like nothing. I let a faucet run water through the mask and it went through unhindered. Now the surrounding countries ( I am Swiss) decided to enforce a FFP2/KN95-Mandate, but our state doesn't work like others, they were behind with everything and implemented it in a way such that only a <em>very</em> tiny minority was against it. I hope they only recommend strongly something and let those who just go along and put up a simple cloth as a sign of good will live.</p>

        <p>But there's also the problem with showing 'good will'. That you show others that you also don't resist the dictatorship. I would find it really hard to not give others a good example by breathing fresh air. Children are already dying of mask complications from what I hear. And if we muzzle up now then what's next? What about the dog collars with proximity sensors that they're planning now? What about mandatory 'vaccines'?</p>

        <p>Where I live I pay hefty fines when not wearing a mask. I just don't want to engage the state in any form.<br>
Otoh, I sat in the - now closed - dining car and the staff just said in a very nice voice if you're not eating, please wear your mask. While exiting the train I wear one, while being in the train and there aren't many I don't. After 20:00  and if there aren't many passenger others don't wear one too and seat themselves on purpose in every other compartment.<br>
And otoh at the place where our national government resides there are different silent protesters each evening sitting on the chairs there unmasked and discussing (sometimes mundane) stuff, I sometimes go there and join the bunch. Of course it is outside, so unmasked.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing. And I apologize if I made the wrong impression.</p>
<p>It's just that I don't think most people understand how important this situation is. We are shaping the future for the next generations right now. The problem is many might just go along with wearing masks for their entire lives - but where do we draw the line? The dog collars? The injections? The 'health passports'? And about the masks people aren't even aware of how dangerous they are - let alone some of the other things the powers are trying to push on us.</p>
<p>I'm just worried that people like you and me might slip into compliance without even noticing it. And the world will burn.</p>

        <p>You wish. Depending on where you live there is a looming "FFP2"-mandate which most security guys (and the police) can't even verify. The cunning Chinese printed ever larger KN95 on the masks so that this scheme can be implemented. Its really a shame. I wonder if there are any supplier of totally  fake masks out of a plastic grate with a large printout on it and some face CE number.</p>

        <p>And the funny thing is there have been studies that show masks are not useful even when doing surgeries. It's a psychological thing more than anything. They believe it has a function so they use it to 'show that they care'. But they don't so much care about all the harm it does.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't think they ARE thinking. I think they just do what they are told because someone in a higher position told them what to do. "Faucci says..." well what if Faucci is wrong? "Then he wouldn't be in his position, telling us what to do." They don't get it, and get angry when people think for themselves. If it weren't true "They wouldn't be telling us to do it." My parents for example come from a place of "You do what the gov. Tells you no matter what because they are looking out for our wellbeing, and if at a later point it turned out to be wrong it was an accident, but at least we were kept safe."</p>

        <p>Yep it's just compliance. It's a lie. When you lie to yourself to that your logic is correct, it doesn't matter what anyone else says. Ironically the very thing that these people made fun of antivaxxers for they are participating in now - cherry picking results to suit their narrative.</p>
<p>Also remember, there's a huge virtue signaling aspect to all of this beyond any kind of safety requirements.</p>

        <p>I'll give this a watch, thank you! I'm open to hearing arguments from different sides. </p>
<p>I guess my comment didn't have so much to do with the validity of the argument of the anti vaxx side, but with the perception that exists around them - meaning that the narrative has always been that they cherry pick information that has been argued and disputed while ignoring mountains of info that contradicts things, which is ironically enough exactly what they're doing now.</p>

        <p>Anyone gotten any symptoms yet? In work like that you really need all the oxygen you can get and you can't afford to increase your carbon dioxide levels.</p>
<p>When people get headaches from mask usage it's a warning signal from the body that harm is being done. Eventually the headaches settle because the body gets 'used to' the decreased oxygen and increased CO2. This is the dangerous part. In the long term irreversible brain damage occurs. And after the first stages of headache, nausea, light headedness etc - in the long term many of the symptoms disappear. And that is how the real damage is done. The effects of this damage may take months or years to show up. And when they do it's all already too late.</p>
<p>I will let them shoot me before putting on this suffocating device.</p>

They think nothing can survive without intervention when in reality the interventions are what cause all the problems. They don't like logic and evidence. They worship death and don't want to face the truth that life is better. They will never stop suffocating and 'vaccinating' everything they can get their hands on. They will never be satisfied until every living thing has been destroyed. That's their religion and they are prepared to kill others to protect it. They are the same people who say they want to kill little babies in order to protect them. It's a death cult.</p>

        <p>I've said this a few times but I developed an infection on my face from wearing masks. These were clean, medical masks that were new every work shift. 3 different doctors told me masks harbor bacteria, especially the cloth masks. To me it makes sense to me people are getting sick from these things, especially if they are cloth masks that aren't being washed.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it offers some protection, but the virus can filter through those masks. To get covid from a person, you have to sit face to face within 6 feet for about 15 minutes or more while wearing no mask. With an n95 that time increases by a whole lot</p>

        <p>Ha, personal attack from a logic free diaper face! BREAHTE SHIT DIAPER FACE. We know you will since you can't comprehend that is absurd to deny that face diapers collect and breed bacteria, collect dead cells, and collect virus particles. It is not common knowledge, but bacteria and dead cells are express pods for viruses. Add that to the fact you are breathing in this pathogen soup over and over. Face diapers are not only INCREASING the spread of viruses, they are MULTIPLYING the spread of bacteria. When they say someone died of complications of covid, they usually mean BACTERIAL pneumonia. What better source of BACTERIA than a face diaper. After face diaper mandates were implemented, cases SKYROCKETED, but through some twisted lawyer/politician logic, that was an excuse for more mandates. A face diaper is mandated self harm.</p>

        <p>&rt;cases skyrocket after masks became the norm</p>
<p>When did they “become the norm”?  What does that mean exactly?  Are you talking about mask mandates?  Also why do the cases “skyrocketing” indicate that it was because of the masks?  Cases also increased because, well, more people got infected.  More infected people means more people to infect others.  Shouldn’t THAT be where you get using “logical reasoning”?</p>

        <p>I also disagree with OP on the fact that wearing masks caused cases to skyrocket. What the data actually shows is cases lowering during the summer months, than spiking as we entered winter. What this does show, however, is that masks did not make any change whatsoever.</p>

        <p>This is true, mask mandates seem to have had a negligible effect on the spread.  The science shows that lockdowns are far and away a better method, though I’m sure OP would balk at those too.</p>

        <p>It would not be intellectually honest for me to disagree with that. As much as I hate how the lockdowns have been handled, they are pretty much the only way to lower the amount of cases we see. At that point we have to ask ourselves, is it worth locking down people who are not in the high risk groups? With a 99.5% survival rate among that population, it is not justifiable to ruin the economy and lose livelihoods. If I were president for a day, I would pass legislation allowing financial aid to at risk populations, if they want it. Also it will allow them to isolate, IF they desire to do so. There would be no mask mandate, but N-95s would be recommended for those who might be worried. No more useless cloth diapers. Finally, the world would go on as normal.</p>

        <p>Honestly I wish we’d just worked out a way to do a hard lockdown for a few weeks and get it over with.  It’s not like the virus knows we’re coming, we could’ve announced a date for everyone to be ready to full lockdown by.  Temporary measures for the homeless/jobless to be able to feed themselves for 2 weeks and in exchange we get to stop the humming and hawing about quarantines/mask mandates wayyyyy earlier.</p>
<p>That’s a tall fucking ask here in the States, but hey, I’m a dreamer.</p>

        <p>Tbh that would not even be necessary. In the very beginning that idea flew because we did not know enough about the virus so it was a “better safe than sorry” situation. Now that its been nearly a year, we have all the data in the world supporting the fact that we overreacted. Wearing cloth masks = no effect, so why keep wearing them? Especially healthy people! Asymptomatic spread was disproven early on. Lockdowns? Small businesses are destroyed and many people have lost jobs. You’d be hard pressed to find anyone who does not at least know someone that got laid off. All this data, yet... here we are. You would think it was Ebola killing everyone you know out in the streets with the draconian measures taking place. It was okay with me when we did not know what the virus was capable of, but now that we have known for a while... its just dishonest and cruel.</p>

        <p>Let's be fair. Most people don't know that. The pathological lying to the masses didn't start in 2020 but ~~most~~ all the older projects have achieved "written in the history books" status and few bother to question it. I mean AIDS doesn't really enter people's minds anymore except as an example of that really bad thing from years ago. The gay men who were the original risk group have been told they will be just fine if they take this thing called PrEP that is supposed to prevent transmission even if you accidentally get your buttsex from one of those asymptomatic HIVpositive guys. Lord only knows what's actually in that stuff. Presumably less overall toxic than the actual AIDS treatments, one would hope.</p>

        <p>You could argue that the numbers skyrocketing because lockdown measures were loosened, and people starting going out again, but with masks.  Obviously, staying home is still slows the spread more than going out with a mask.</p>

        <p>Numbers skyrocketing is more accurately attributed to PCR tests being broken and highly inaccurate.  This has been proven.  Telling a thousand healthy people that they have a deadly disease is pretty silly in my opinion.  The test doesn't work.   The test never worked.  A thousand healthy people who have no symptoms (hence why I called them healthy) carrying a deadly plague that will kill them all?  Umm... no.  </p>
<p>So why do you trust a PCR test that has been ruled in court as being unreliable?</p>

        <p>You could try to argue that, but do you have a shred of data?  Timings of lockdowns or the easing of restrictions that correlate with changes in case loads, and are consistent across states and countries?</p>
<p>The truth is that after a year of this crap, there isn't any data that holds up suggesting lockdown stringency correlates with fewer cases or deaths, nor that mask mandates or compliance do.  </p>
<p>Once a respiratory disease reaches a certain penetration cases vary with season/climate and testing.  Deaths vary with population health/age (and testing...).  Every other factor is of negligible significance unless you can literally close borders and lock everyone down before the disease has taken hold.  Since sars-cov-2 was spreading for months before we knew about it, this was never an option in the us/europe.</p>
<p>Since this data is widely available and researched, the only explanation for not understanding it is either willful ignorance or being bombarded with scary anecdotes and lies from pop media and facebook.  No serious thought is taking place here.</p>

<p>Maybe. But to let Chinese tourists travel across Europe mid-March was obscene back then.</p>

        <p>Seriously?  When the disease has been loose in the area for 4-5 months and countless europeans are contagious and spreading the disease, you think it's in any way relevant that any one particular group is traveling?  Do you listen to yourself?</p>

        <p>No you don't understand, read closely: 2019.12.31 was the 1st and official report to the WHO by the Chinese. Nobody could have known what is happening at that point about November. But then they tested all over Europe and Italy crashed into that media apocalypse and hysteric hospital frenzies - but here they let Chinese from Milan to Berlin in trains. The November thing was only a rumor at the End of March where the borders were closed and confirmed much later.<br>

        <p>Someone would pay me to educate you idiots?  I'm in the wrong line of work.  Pretty sure the only outed bots have all been pro-lockdown anyway.</p>
<p>This really isn't complicated.  People, both chinese and others, were traveling in and out of China and all the affected areas the entire time.  Since this is a cold, and spreads like a cold, it was clear that it wasn't contained to China.  Later testing confirmed that it had been circulating for a month or more already, but the borders simply weren't closed until well after the disease started spreading.  </p>
<p>Once the disease is in wide circulation, shutting borders accomplishes nothing.  Travel restrictions accomplish nothing.  Telling one group of people that has been in China, but not others, that they aren't welcome accomplishes nothing.  What we have been saying for months and months now (and CDC has known/published for years), beyond a certain level of disease penetration, lockdowns don't do a damn thing to limit overall cases and mortality.</p>
<p>But I'm done with you, go do the research, the data is all there.  /banish!</p>

<p>The far right parties in Europe wanted to close borders 22-25th January 2020. But that was a big nono so they let it slide through. that it circulated way before was known not before End of March. </p>
<p>I live here, I know what happened. I am not pro any measure for that matter but you got it historically wrong and that irks me.</p>
