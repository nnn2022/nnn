    <strong>This Is Why Society Worships "COVID"</strong>
    <p><p>Literally all corporations and even regular folks who still have jobs are benefitting from this imaginary "new" disease, and that explains why they want the illusion to stay forever. </p>
<p>How are they benefitting? Let's take a look at only a few examples:</p>
<p>Customer service departments have cut staff by ~90%. Instead of having 200 people answer customers' calls, let's only have 20 on the payroll and have the customer spend an hour on hold... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more free breakfast or daily housekeeping at most hotels... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>Returns no longer accepted at most shops... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more free food samples at grocery stores... You can still pay for that 1 slice of ham if you want to try it at the deli, but no more free sample... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more pool access or very limited hours, but still pay full HOA dues... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>Extremely limited availability of loaner vehicles at the dealership... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more indoor dining at McDonald's in order to cut staff cleaning and maintaining it. Let the pesants spend 15 minutes in drive-thru for "fast-food" instead... Oh, you want free refill? FUCK YOU...! <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>Teachers prefer to so sit on their fat asses at home all day watching Netflix and spend an hour or two on a zoom call instead of actually working, while getting paid the full salary... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>Karen Schmoe doesn't feel like working for a week or two, but she can't get approval from her boss? Well, she thinks she has a fever now, so her time off is automatically approved... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more medical malpractice. Your relatively healthy father died under a minor surgery due to excessive bleeding as a result of the incompetent doctor? Well, you guessed it... He tested positive, so... <em>you know, COVID...</em></p></p>

        <p>it was ready before anyone even got news of it here, it had to be. No roll out of all that plus the sanitizer and masks would be able to move that fast into stores unless there was at least a month worth of planning. I work in retail, it's a big project getting new seasonal items in that takes just as long if not longer. The amount of work that would have went into covid preparations considering how much more was involved than just product would be way longer than a month in the making especially since literally overnight every single store had the same thing going on. It's all a big show.</p>

        <p>The mask mandates didn't start showing up before late summer around here. The plexiglass also seemed like an afterthought.</p>
<p>In fact, health officials around Europe "mislead" the public (ironically by speaking the truth) of the efficiency of masks in the beginning to avoid there being a shortage for medical doctors.</p>
<p>But yes, it's definitely a big show. The props are just there as reminders rather than protection.</p>

        <p>Meh, we are deeply fucked way before the wuhan virus.</p>
<p>The years of "education", blind trust in science and emasculation shaped people this way, I too fall for it before.</p>
<p>Now am just curious to see what's next in the near future, for humanity and the world.</p>
<p>Just go through my comments or posts for the replies I get, Im tired of arguing or debating with people who just choose to keep their eyes closed forever. Really no point to even talk sense into them, especially those with selective memory.</p>

        <p>I was just debating someone about the way kids are drugged at 8-9 years old, then the media tries to blame the guns when they shoot up the school 8 years later. Well yeah, you've melted their developing brain with amphetamine, SS/NRI's, shit even tranquelizers.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to letting a kid twitch a bit? If they're not paying attention, you're probably a shit teacher teaching bullshit anyways. Then we have all these BS programs like DARE and Above the Influence, and the wonderful schism of anti-sex campaigns meets "how to fistfuck safely" classes, the poor little shit just wants to get some titty and smoke a cigarette, drink a beer, try pot, whatever, and you kicked him out of school for chewing an L shape into a poptart and he pretended it was a pistol.</p>
<p>Our society is so fucked, It's about mind control and the zombification of the youth. So many kids I knew were simultaneously declared hyperactive yet were falling asleep in class because they were loaded up with extracurriculars and homework just to keep their hands off their dicks.</p>

        <p>The funniest one for me- rememberthe sanitizing wipes stores used to have outside so (if you were germaphobic) you could wipe off the grocery cart handle? Gone now, because COVID! For a little while, stores paid the worst employee to kinda wipe things down with a rag, but they are gone now. But the wipes are still gone too! Ya know, because COVID.</p>

        <p>May seem ironic, but they knew what they were doing. In the beginning it was necessary to put on the show of wiping everything in order for the sheep to believe in the hoax, but now that everyone if a follower of this cult, why spend money on useless wipes or employees?</p>

        <p>I still laugh that they closed one of three available entrances to our Wally World, then funneled everyone through a single entrance/exit in single file with just a stanchion to keep them separate.</p>
<p>Yeah, now 100% of entering and exiting customers are coming in contact with each other instead of making one big fucking door an entrance and one big fucking door exit.</p>
<p>I knew in that moment that it wasn't about safety, they <em>wanted</em> people to get sick. It was a blowjob.</p>
