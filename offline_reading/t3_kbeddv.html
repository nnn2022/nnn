    <strong>Where‚Äôs my AIDS vaccine? üíâ</strong>
    <p><p>Back in 1991 Zach from Rage Against The Machine Ian‚Äôs these lyrics on the song ‚ÄúDarkness Of Greed‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
But these governments they don't mind the procrastination
They say "We'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vaction"‚Äù</p>
<p>My question is this, how the fuck can we develop a vaccine for a virus that was discovered last year but there is still no AIDS vaccine? </p>
<p>Is it because this virus is attaching the 1%?</p></p>

        <p>HIV is a retrovirus. "retrovirus¬†is a type of virus that inserts a copy of its RNA genome into the DNA of a host cell that it invades, thus changing the genome of that cell."</p>
<p>Once it's in your DNA, you can't get it out, only suppress it. </p>
<p>Also, the AIDS epidemic was likely started from a polio vaccination campaign in the Congo from 1957 to 1960.  They used chimpanzee kidney cell cultures to grow the polio virus, extracted the virus in a crude way, and then fed that shit to over a million children. Chimps are known carriers of SIV, the closest relative to HIV.</p>

        <p>So... why are they using an mRNA vaccine to insert a copy of the COVID virus into your genome? To invade the host cell and multiply, thus changing the genome of that cell? Seems risky.</p>

        <p>That's not what's happening at all. Your genome remains unaltered. Your cells use the mrna to make a viral protein. This protein is important for coronavirus infectivity BUT USELESS WITHOUT THE OTHER VIRAL PROTEINS. </p>
<p>Your immune system then makes antibodies against this protein and now, when confronted with real SARS-CoV-2 your immune system is primed and you immediately produce these antibodies to combat it.</p>

        <p>The mRNA-based vaccine approach doesn't "insert a copy of the COVID virus into your genome". The mRNA strand is translated into the viral protein product, which the body then recognizes as foreign, mounting an immune response.</p>

        <p>Oh man.  I got to watch Fauci speak at the national HIV update conference this year.  He is so clearly bored with HIV research now that he has COVID.  He basically gave a speech that said that a vaccine isn't necessary because of U=U, but you know what does need a vaccine?  The rona.  Seriously, 95 percent of that conference was about COVID.</p>

<p>When people ask "Why would they lie, or even wildly exaggerate the danger of COVID?" this is what I always refer to - these people are BORED of giving dry academic talks and writing papers that only a very small number or their peers will skim and promptly forget.</p>
<p>But now here is a chance to be a WORLDWIDE AUTHORITY on something, to FINALLY have some real power in the world - to shape the public health policy of the entire civilized world.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder they have lost every last scruple they might have had?</p>

        <p>Exactly.  Like I have been saying they should just release whatever and have the rubes inject it and they won't know the difference because the virus isn't deadly.  Hopefully the side effects are manageable but a placebo would have worked too.</p>

        <p>This is exactly right except for the part where they tested a placebo and showed that it didn‚Äôt work. This is how they know the vaccine prevents COVID. The information is available in a free NEJM article that anyone can read</p>

        <p>There's no vaccine because aids is not contagious and was just one of many fake health scares that have been fed you over the years. It's a syndrome of weakened immunity but it isn't caused by HIV. What the actual research seems to suggest is that some kinds of drug abuse can trigger it (the US cases), in addition to just simple malnutrition (Africa). Don't go by any statistic that measures "HIV positive" because those test results are delivered by our old buddy Polymerase Chain Reaction. Remember at the beginning of the scamdemic this year when it came out almost immediately that there was no gold standard test to isolate covid? And the test they do have is basically guesswork and bullshit? Yeah, that's been going on longer than you think.</p>

        <p>You're the worst kind of human being. Honestly, the worst. You have no evidence to support your claims beyond "the actual research" which you haven't linked or told us where to find. You lie about a disease that killed millions of people, children included, suggesting a casual link between two completely unrelated things. And that's not even the COVID stuff, which I realize this subreddit doesn't acknowledge. </p>
<p>I guess I should be asking how you're better informed than the doctors and scientists who have been studying HIV for decades, but I'm sure they're all just trained crisis actors in your mind</p>
