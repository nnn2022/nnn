    <strong>Who really is mentally ill right now? From the perspective of an OCD patient.</strong>
    <p><p>So as a preface I want to say I am diagnosed with OCD. Yeah, the mental illness that is mostly made fun of, used as a joke, not taken seriously, great skits in shows, etc. Its great. Anywho, I have been in therapy for about 7 years due to PTSD &amp; OCD so I know it like the back of my hand at this point. There are different kinds of OCD and although mine was mostly organization/scheduling/rituals I also had some cleaning/germ issues. </p>
<p>When I was in therapy, everything that people are being told to religiously do as much as they are, was frowned upon. What everyone is being shamed into doing, I was told was a literal mental illness that I needed to be treated for. Washing your hands too much,  being scared of germs infesting you, being scared of people being a disease vector that could harm or kill you. Also excess hand sanitizer use, that was a huge no no because I was told its an immune system killer. That germs are good and healthy for us and getting sick was a natural part of life. </p>
<p>I was told for years I had a mental illness. I worked years of my life to heal my mind and heal my body and live the way biology and nature intended. And now people with no idea of my history or past are telling me I have a mental illness for...not giving into my mental illness? And also that i "know nothing" because I'm not a doctor, even though everything i know i learned from doctors during my treatment.. Like if there was ever a time to be fucking confused in my life it is right now. And my therapist agrees with me, that the years of therapy we had were not for nothing. These people are literally being spoon fed a mental illness (which at least gives me a deeper insight on my own) and they have no idea. Because they have become mentally ill. Their thoughts have changed. Their habits. Idk if its OCD or Stockholm syndrome or just general fear of being labeled a serial killer for being a normal human with normal germs but I feel bad for others. I suffered for years and still do due to this mental illness and now I see a whole world with it. Not to mention how this is scaring and harming children. </p>
<p>So idk, unless my doctors and therapist and their degrees mean nothing and thousands of years of medicine and studies mean nothing then I guess I am just a dumb fuck like all these people say. But I am definitely going to trust my medical team more than the people who became twice as rich as we all suffered in poverty and illness who speak on a microphone on TV and tell me I'm a murderer for being a human being. But thats just me.</p></p>

<p>I can't imagine what this is doing to people who have germ/sanitation issues due to OCD. Good on you for taking steps to better yourself.</p>

        <p>I have OCD too, haven’t really had contamination too much but I have experienced it at times. When this first started in March, I took rubbing alcohol with me to disinfect things while I was at the store.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks I realized that I wasn’t going to do that and I was instead going to approach the situation using skills I learned in Exposure and Response Prevention Therapy, or Exposure Therapy as it’s commonly called. I really recommend to anyone struggling with OCD to learn about ERP. You can find a therapist to help you do it or you can try to implement techniques into your life on your own. There’s also a really great app for OCD called NOCD which has an online community function, and online therapy, which helped me a lot. I really don’t recommend pharmaceuticals for OCD.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the comment, I don't take medication and have tried ERP for years. This post was more so about the fact that we are being told to "avoid exposure" so that therapy method is literally the opposite of what is being blasted on media. Confusing times. Glad you are taking care of yourself &lt;3</p>

        <p>Thank you for this.  Very insightful. </p>
<p>I have often worried about the power of media and social consensus to alter people's mindset.  It doesn't matter what, if enough people say it and hear it often enough it must be true.</p>
<p>But even I never expected the incredible explosion of germaphobia I see right now.  (I just saw the term coronophobia in another post as a diagnosable  condition)</p>
<p>Think of it this way;  You are fortunate to have a background which gave you a degree of immunity to the mental virus going around.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing what you go through and genuinely hope that things have been a little bit easier for you, I deal with my share of MH issues and have dealt a little bit with OCD but it was a part of my life that hasn't returned back thankfully but with the constant sanitization, cleaning and overcleaning that people do I don't think is healthy at all and it'll bring up a generation of people that live in an overly sterile environment and like you've mentioned in your post, we need germs to boost our immune system, same reason some parents allow their children to play in dirt</p>

        <p>I have extremely severe OCD as well, it’s a constant battle almost every day, I’ve been suffering from it since my childhood, and I wholeheartedly agree with you. These days I mostly suffer from pure-OCD but I’ve definitely struggled with obsessive fears of contamination and germs as well, mostly during my childhood, I used to wash my hands so much that they’d bleed. I also used excessive hand sanitizer, I’d not just sanitize my hands though, I’d use it to sanitize all sorts of item and stuff around my bedroom growing up. I remember even sometimes I would dump sanitizer all over the floor and rub it onto the floor because I didn’t want to “walk in the germs.” Just like you, I’d been told for years that I was mentally ill, what I’ve been doing is totally illogical, but now I see people, family members, the same people whom directly told me that I had a mental illness and was engaging in illogical actions, are doing the same sort of things that I used to do, washing their hands excessively, quarantining shipments and deliveries in separate rooms in their houses, wearing surgical gloves to open packages, and so on and so forth. It’s just absolutely infuriating seeing this going on, the media has turned everybody into total obsessive compulsives about germs. It’s ridiculous.</p>

        <p>No, you're right. During this crisis, a lot of people have temporarily started acting like they have OCD, psychosis, schizophrenia, and the like. What your doctors were telling you before was correct. Now that mass OCD/psychosis/etc. is going on, you being healthy is making you not the norm, quite ironically, but I think you should continue to act healthy as much as possible (2019 definition of healthy!).</p>

        <p>slightly unrelated because i'm not much of a germaphobe (i fear physical substances like sticky things) but i've had persistent depressive disorder for the past ~5 years and mild ocd for my entire life</p>
<p>my ocd has spiraled out of control to levels i once never thought possible. in the past i deemed my ocd mild and never bothered me much, but now it has completely taken over my life and affects every decision i make to the point where anything outside of my designated "routine" of waking up/eating/drinking water/showering is a task comparable to lifting a tank</p>
<p>it's gotten to the point where i am now presently contacting psychiatrists in order to receive medication because life is completely unbearable/unlivable. in the past i had never considered medication as a viable option due to possible permanent damage and intolerable side effects, but i've stopped caring at this point</p>

        <p>I have anxiety issues and I feel the same way. It feels like society has entered mass hysteria and I'm able to see everyone who's never had to develop ways to handle anxiety suddenly unable to operate under the stress of something like a pandemic (admittedly this is much less severe than past pandemics and spares the young and an exceedingly high percentage of most healthy adults).</p>
<p>Oddly I tend to think that mental illness may function like a vaccine. People who've adapted mechanisms to identify and fight mental issues are able to resist the mass hysteria that affects society at large. When you have the personal experience of pathological mental states - you see it very clearly in everyone else.</p>
