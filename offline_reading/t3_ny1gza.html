    <strong>Questions for some NoNewNormal users from a "Pro" NewNormal</strong>
    <p><p>I have two main questions to ask.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you do believe in a conspiracy about COVID then why do so many people attack the following "sheep" rather than try to convince them? Unlike other mainstream conspiracies out there like flatearthers, I see more attacks or criticisms on the victims or 'sheeple' here. Wouldn't trying to convince them to see your side or not attacking them at all because they are not really at fault here work better? Millions of Americans cannot be in on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do believe in some plot about getting everyone vaccinated, why do you think they want everyone  vaccinated? What good would it do to make everyone get vaccinated? The only logical reasoning I can see behind this is that it is about control, but most people already follow the government. Plus Trump is usually associated with being against the new normal, but he was the president during this time, so why would he go against this publicly if not as part of the scheme. (Which I doubt since Biden is pro and Trump has not changed his view at all.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>P.S. Sorry for spelling mistakes, I am on mobile writing this quickly.</p></p>

        <p>1) People are trying to spread the truth, but the "sheep" refuse to listen and get abusive towards us... there are great efforts to get the truth out there in the UK, huge protests, people going into police stations and presenting evidence etc etc. Slowly more and more people are waking up.</p>
<p>2) if you genuinely want to know what going on around the world I can show you. It is regarding the 4th Industrial Revolution, which means AI.
AI is here, that is the entire point of 5G for supporting AI on mass scale. With the roll out of AI most jobs will be automated so majority of the world will be unemployed.
To deal with this the elite need a) less people on Earth and b) universal basic income for those that remain (It is already being tested in Irleand and Wales, there even MSM articles on it)
This universal income will be tied to digital IDS that record everything about us, absolutely everything. Exactly like China's social credit system. If you don't toe the line and let the elite do whatever they want to you, you don't receive your social credit and you can't buy food.
That is what the Digital IDs are for. Vaccine Passports are a pre cursor for these Digital IDS, the Vaccine Passport app in the UK has already been discovered to contain parameters for all sorts of data including: Ethnicity, criminal record, alleged criminal behaviour, you social circle, etc etc many more.</p>
<p>This was never about health - it was a push for Digital IDS to bring about this 4th Industrial revolution, to reduce numbers and have us that remain subservient to the elite like slaves.</p>
<p>That is why lockdowns happened, why smaller business had to close but large powerful corporations could stay open, why they are now talking about climate control lockdowns even in the msm... it was never about health.</p>
<p>In UK we are now averaging just 1 or 2 deaths a day from people who "tested positive for Covid-19 within 28 days"
Meanwhile we are averaging 5.7 deaths a day from the vaccines based on the MHRAs own published data, (which we know only accounts for at most 10% of vaccine reactions and deaths).</p>
<p>So clearly more are dying here from the vax daily then Covid-19... yet yesterday it was announced lockdown would continue for another month... why? Based on their OWN data there is no need! </p>
<p>Like I said, it was never about health.
If you want a genuine open discussion I would be happy and provide proof for the things I have said.
There are many other facets to realise aswell, like the fact that there are already effective treatments for Covid-19 (Ivermectin) is one...it has been used for 40 years we know it is safe and effective.</p>

        <p>Hello. First of all I for one try to be very civil towards those with different views. But as soon as you offer an alternative view on any pro covid, you get "nobody cares unless you are a doctor" "your a selfish monster for not getting vaxxed" "conspiracy theorists" "where is your proof" all the usual stuff. And then you get banned from participating from those subs. In real life when you talk to people who feel differently, they are often very stubborn, act like they are listening and try to shut you down with "tell that to the millions of families who lost people". I've stopped trying now because once people go so far, people are to proud to change their views regardless.</p>
<p>The implementation of vaccine is  to see which governments and which people are most compliant. It's nothing to do with people's health.</p>

        <p>1) I don't beliewe in any conspiracy, instead it is ill-based group-thinking arising from fear.</p>
<p>2) Money. Big pharma uses any means whatsoever to make money. Don't assume any responsibility etc from their part, it is only the money with no moral.</p>

<li>
<p>Your question seems to be trying to understand our point of view. However, not all “newnormalers” are open-minded. On the contrary, it is almost impossible to change their mind even when you present them with facts/figures. If the other party is not willing to exchange ideas - trying to convince them is futile. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting everyone vaccinated could be about maximizing profit or it could be about population control. Or a mix of both. We cannot rule out the population control theory. This past year has shown that the rulers are willing to go to extreme ends and bend science, social media, doctors to achieve their goal. Healthcare is definitely not the goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I can’t comment on Trump, except to say he could have done a lot more when he had the power.</p>

        <p>1 It's easier to fool someone than to convince them that they are being fooled. When we try to point out facts they tarnish and ridicule us. They can't even accept a single thing what we say. Once a user asked me to show articles regarding cons of covid vaccine. And I showed the interview of Nobel prize winner's video where he says mass vaccinations during a pandemic is casing variants. He disproved it by saying it's not a peer previewed article. Even if mRNA inventors say mRNA vaccines are harmful they don't believe it. They won't get convinced not matter how we try. Therefore I have stopped showing articles. </p>
<p>2 Nope big pharma is producing vaccines just for money. They don't care about our health. Hence this rushed vaccines with no long term studies</p>

        <p>1 Because of how these people usually act. They don't want their mind changed or even open to discussion.</p>
<ol>
<li>Best case scenario is greed, everyone on the planet getting 2 shots that cost $15 each and they don't even have to take it? Hell yeah.</li>
</ol>
<p>Worst case scenario they are trying to depopulate the planet and sterilize people so the peasants are no longer the ones making children.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As for Trump being anti new normal but pro vaccine, the vaccine was going to happen no matter what, trump ramming it through EUA might have been a blessing, because they were going to lockdown everything until the vaccine came out and it would of had full approval so it would of been mandatory.</p>
<p>I do wonder if we went that 2nd route people would of won out and got away from vaccines and lockdowns anyway.</p>

        <p>1/ I have wasted a lot of time earlier in the "pandemic" discussing things, trying to raise awareness, provide censored information and so on... What I bumped up against, again and again - was people's attachment to believing a comfortable lie - over the uncomfortable truth - and so avoiding the subsequent discombobulation from having ones world view shook.</p>
<p>There are no ifs nor buts about it, no debate. So many "conspiracies" have come true concerning this pandemic. It is painfully clear what it is, and to be ignorant of it at this point is a choice - and so to be a sheep.</p>
<p>This is an interesting read on the phycological block so many have.</p>
<p>https://reportingforbeauty.substack.com/p/on-the-psychology-of-the-conspiracy-7ff</p>
<p>2/ it's about reducing population levels, quite drastically. You will see it over the next few years very clearly, initially "new strains" will be blamed.</p>
