        <p>The doctor says he recommends the vaccine to at risk populations however, here is what he says in the video. Please watch though, I learned so much. It was very informative. </p>
<p>The doctor hasn’t taken the anti body test because he has tested positive every month since when he believed to have covid. For months straight he kept testing positive and overtime even showed a higher quantity of antibodies. Then he calls out the CDC. </p>
<p>“If you have naturally recovered from an illness from my understanding as a doctor and scientist, those antibodies will always be better than the vaccine”. </p>
<p>He claims that the CDC reports that if you have recovered from a virus you shouldn’t get a vaccine until 90 days after. He claims this was pulled out of thin air. There isn’t much evidence or data for this.</p>
<p>“We must ask ourselves a logical question. If we are suggesting that recovering from an illness the antibodies and immunity last for 90 days, then how could a vaccine possibly last any longer than 90 days”. </p>
<p>Another issue he has with it is asymptomatic spread. “There is no evidence that having a vaccine EVER prevents asymptomatic spread of an illness, if you have a vaccine and it works for any illness then it will stop you from experiencing symptoms but you can still have some particles to you”</p>
<p>He goes on to explain that there is a problem occurring where antibodies are present and people are receiving the vaccine so this could provoke a hyper immune response”. Because of the covid 19 vaccinations, we have seen cases of hyper immune responses. He says people like himself who are healthy, workout everyday, young, are the demographic that HIS and this type of demographic is even more include to a hyper immune response. </p>
<p>He says his motto as a doctor and in medicine is “do no harm”. He said “there are people that I have encountered who say ‘just take the vaccine, it’s far easier to have just the shot AND that doesn’t sit well with me as a DOCTOR AND A SCIENTIST, I am an internal life medicine, I practice all about intervention. I value my body. I value anyone’s body. I am NEVER in favor of any intervention of medicine or injection that is NOT needed”. </p>
<p>“I feel like I am being backed into a corner here because there are news reports that very soon they are going to implement vaccine passports to do anything, everyday things and I’m somebody who loves to travel, I love restaurants, and if we have to show a vaccine passport in order to get into these places or travel then I am going to have to LOGISTICALLY AND PRACTICALLY Figure out what to do”. </p>
<p>He says if he had to he’d go for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as opposed to M or P. He thinks if the time comes to have a vaccine passport that showing proof of antibodies should be equivalent to receiving the vaccine. </p>
<p>“Medicine is not an arbitrary science, I never believe in rules for everybody, medicine especially is a case by case science and is often more grey in medicine than black and white. And I believe in individualized medicine. And NOBODY knows all of the answers whether it be more or anyone else who CLAIMS to be an expert like Fauci himself. Medicine and science is constantly evolving and we’re learning”.</p>
