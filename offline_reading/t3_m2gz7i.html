    <strong>Vaccine skepticism</strong>
    <p><p>So, when all this vaccine stuff rolled out I was all for it. I still think it makes sense for older, high risk groups to be vaccinated. </p>
<p>Recently my grandfather got the vaccine and it literally said on the paper "this vaccine is not FDA approved". And that you can't sue them if you suffer injuries from it. </p>
<p>So why are we so willing to roll out a non FDA approved vaccine to ages that are not in high risk categories? I am not some conspiracy person, but we don't know the long term effects and I think it should at least have FDA approval... </p>
<p>I'm afraid that I will need it to go back to school on campus and we won't know the long term consequences until it's too late.</p>
<p>Is anyone else super sketched out about this? If you want to share some sort of evidence to calm my nerves be my guest.</p></p>

        <p>Of course everyone here is suspicious. In short, it‚Äôs beyond clear that this vaccine supports unseen motives. Will everyone die from it? Absolutely not. Are there long term side effects? I‚Äôm sure of it. I am choosing to avoid it at all costs - at least until I don‚Äôt feel like a pawn in a global agenda. I‚Äôm not anti jab but I‚Äôm anti jab when it‚Äôs targeted at the entire world and people are cornered into an injection that guarantees no manufacturer liability. </p>
<p>Make a personal decision and use wisdom on this one.</p>

        <p>If I talk to anyone in my state about it they make it out like I'm anti science or conspiracy theorist. And if I give them the statistics on who is affected the most and logically reason with them they make it seem like I want to kill all old people basically.

        <p>Do we even have enough scientific evidence to really believe, honestly and scientifically, that the coronavirus is deadly? If it traditionally takes years and years to establish that a vaccine is safe and effective, could we possibly conclude so quickly that a virus we‚Äôve never seen before is deadly?</p>

        <p>I'm in the same exact situation... Except Computer Networking student. My campus made a revolutionary update saying they're going to hold classes in person next semester after the governor lifted some restrictions (bars are still closed 100% though LOL). I really hope they offer some online classes for people who don't want to get the vaccine if they're forcing it on people because I don't know how to fill out a religious exemption form :p They basically tried blaming the kids for spreading it through parties, but at the time, the 50ish year olds were the ones who are more likely to get it. Yet they didn't require teachers to get tested before teaching on campus this semester. Giant firework show held by the school while students sat in the bleachers outside. But they weren't given an in person commencement. It's messed up and illogical and makes me upsetti spaghetti.</p>

        <p>Oh I agree. Compliancy. People want to wear masks until the end of time. There is NO REASON why people who got the vaccine should have to wear masks. They can't even spread it. And if the older high risk people have immunity to covid from getting the vaccine, why must we wear masks to stop it from spreading to them!?</p>

        <p>&rt; They can't even spread it</p>
<p>Actually they can still spread it, not even the manufacturers of these vaccines are claiming that it prevents you from spreading it. These vaccines only suppress the so called symptoms, nothing more.</p>

        <p>It is unfortunate how unhealthy our (USA) population is on average, and that so many of the high risk categories for serious illnesses and death from COVID-19 are so common. But even if we agreed that obese people deserve whatever poor-health related fates they face (and I don‚Äôt agree on this point, to be clear; I‚Äôm not sure if what you might? have been trying to insinuate is tantamount to it), there are other, more universally agreeably non-deserving groups who are facing higher risk than the general populace. It would have been nice if our mitigations had been implemented better, rather than half-assed like they generally were, who knows where we could be at this point. How much pain have we experienced in the last year, socially, economically, mental health, trust in each other and institutions? It hurts, and the light at the end of the tunnel from these vaccines is far from certain to stop the virus and its mutations cleanly in their tracks, but they are the best hope we have at this point. It‚Äôs easy to point out the obvious that ‚Äúvaccines we developed incredibly quickly due a global emergency‚Äù are in fact ‚Äúvaccines that we developed incredibly quickly due a global emergency,‚Äù and that we don‚Äôt know what will happen next week/month/year, neither from the vaccine nor from COVID-19. But we Do know what they are doing Now, and we do know which of the two present the significantly higher risk in both the short term and the long term.</p>

        <p>I was not anti-vax until I heard of Pfizer's Trovan tests in Kano, Nigeria from 1996. Prior to that, I dreamt of working at either Pfizer or Merck because I believed that the only way to save Africans (where I am from) was through vaccines. I was in my late teens in 2009 when I discovered the truth behind every single Big Pharma company and how most of them had their founding in eugenics, population control and genocide. What triggered this was my discovery that ibogaine was a natural substitute for methadone in opioid addicts and was systematically suppressed. Suffice it to say, I quit my love affair with medicine and am now a staunch anti-vaxxer.</p>

        <p>Relevant to the current thread: Risks of an unmitigated virus with known pathology. Risks of taking one of the available vaccines developed to mitigate said virus, especially given 1) that these vaccines have been carefully developed, tested, and emergency-approved in light of the effects of the virus; 2) that now these vaccines have been effectively ‚Äútested‚Äù on millions of more people under the emergency use authorizations in the US and other countries; and 3) all that science knows about vaccines in general (which helps scientists better understand the potential risks and non-risks of these Operation Warp Speed rushed vaccines). Risk to hospitals and other critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>How can you say this when they were rushed in less than half a year and skipped most safety criteria? Are you aware that most of these vaccines only conclude Phase 3 trials in 2022?   </p>
<p>&rt; all that science knows about vaccines in general (which helps scientists better understand the potential risks and non-risks of these Operation Warp Speed rushed vaccines).   </p>
<p>What science has known for decades is that ALL coronavirus vaccines cause liver damage, prion disease and antibody dependent enhancement. ALL of these grave issues were ignored with the current crop of jabs.</p>

        <p>It sounds like there might be a part of "emergency" and "emergency use authorization" (EUA) you are not understanding? The vaccines were rushed because of an emergency. They (some of them at this point, at least), have been granted the EUA because of...did you guess correctly?...an emergency. A global emergency that is fortunately not as bad as it could be (in part due to mitigation efforts), but still bad enough to call an emergency.</p>
<p>Further. A thing can be rushed uncarefully, sure sure. It can also be rushed carefully. Still following me, here? Lovely. It would be nice for something like a vaccine to not be rushed. It would also be nice to defeat this pandemic or at least mitigate it to a point were we can live full lives again. And given the pathology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it seems that the sooner we can get vaccines out that are reasonably vetted for both safety and effectiveness, the better. Fortunately lots of people have been working on this and trying to get it done both safely and quickly. So, there have been trials and tests. There has been analysis. There has been careful trials and tests and careful analysis. More time is needed for normal approval. There is an emergency going on. People are dying, we can't safely live our normal lives for the time being without things getting super duper bad. So there have been EUA applications. The FDA took longer to granting the EUAs than many were hoping for.    One might compare the option of just immediately granting each EUA upon application (this <em>would</em> have been, arguably, a "careless rush" of the vaccine), which did not happen and which seems likely to continue to not happen with the remaining vaccines, to the option of careful analysis of the applications and the data they contain. I suppose, having not been in those FDA meetings, I can't say with certainty how careful their consideration of the applications was. I am making the assumption that their choice to take their time was due at least in part to them performing a careful analysis. One might attempt this comparison. Maybe. One might also go back to earlier in this thread to consider the "risk comparison" comment. Sadly, one might also not do this. One has freedom in these things.   So the vaccines have been pretty darned well tested for safety. They have also been pretty darned well tested for effectiveness. We know what we are up against, and we know what we finally have at our disposal to fight against it.</p>
<p>And as for the prion/liver damage/antibody dependent enhancement stuff, I thought we implicitly agreed to keep this a non-conspiracy theorist dialogue? I could be mistaken, since it was never explicitly stated and you are free to be the conspiracy theorist you appeared to claim to not be.</p>
<p>Caveat: I failed to find anything more recent about liver damage and coronavirus vaccines than the 2004 stuff about a single small study on a handful of ferrets and some hepatitis the developed after exposure to Both an experimental SARS (the original, from 2002-ish?) vaccine and the virus itself. Certainly seems worth the scientists being aware of, but does not affirm any concern about coronavirus vaccines in general.</p>

        <p>&rt;It sounds like there might be a part of "emergency" and "emergency use authorization" (EUA) you are not understanding? The vaccines were rushed because of an emergency.</p>
<p>It was such an 'emergency' that there was a well-coordinated systematic effort to suppress research on other CHEAP drugs that have been known to be safe for DECADES such as HCQ, CQ, azithromycin, ivermectin, etc. Sure, "mUh EmErGeNcY!"  </p>
<p>&rt;And given the pathology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,</p>
<p>You mean for a virus for which 99.9% of the population survive WITHOUT any medical intervention? Yeah, what a virulent pathogen indeed!  </p>
<p>&rt;it seems that the sooner we can get vaccines out that are reasonably vetted for both safety and effectiveness, the better. Fortunately lots of people have been working on this and trying to get it done both safely and quickly. So, there have been trials and tests. There has been analysis. There has been careful trials and tests and careful analysis.</p>
<p>If you are skipping the normal process and animal trials, then nothing can be assumed to be safe and effective outside of the immediate short-term (ie, beyond the \~60 days of the Phase 2 trials).  </p>
<p>&rt;There is an emergency going on. People are dying, we can't safely live our normal lives for the time being without things getting super duper bad. So there have been EUA applications.</p>
<p>People died in their droves because there was a deliberate attempt to silence evidence that cheap, generic effective drugs ALREADY existed.  </p>
<p>&rt;So the vaccines have been pretty darned well tested for safety. ...  They have also been pretty darned well tested for effectiveness.</p>

<p>&rt;And as for the prion/liver damage/antibody dependent enhancement stuff, I thought we implicitly agreed to keep this a non-conspiracy theorist dialogue?</p>
<p>Aw, sugar. Do you want to read the peer-reviewed articles stretching from 2004 to 2020 about all of these things, or will you continue to call them 'conspiracy theories?' All you need to do is to ask for references and I am more than happy to furnish you with them.  </p>

<p>Not very good at critical thinking are you?</p>
<ol>
<li>There are no recent studies because the scientists QUIT trying to make coronavirus vaccines because every single attempt resulted in failed animal trials. At least read the conclusions of the ferret study articles!</li>
<li>There are no recent animal studies for SARS-CoV-2 because &lt;drum roll please&rt; ANIMAL STUDIES WERE SKIPPED! This means that YOU are the ferret in this Phase 3 experiment (which ends in 2022).</li>
<li>SARS-CoV-2 is 79.5% identical to SARS-CoV-1 so what could go wrong with skipping animal trials this time?</li>

        <p>This makes me think about flying.
My boyfriend got covid recently. No symptoms. Was over my house for three days. Rapid test showed positive. I waited until day 5 since exposure to get a rapid test. Negative. Waited a few more days, took PCR test. Negative. Then I looked into the accuracy of the rapid tests and they're extremely unreliable! So why are we using them? Probably the same reason we have TSA. To make people feel safe. 
So hypothetically if I get the vaccine in India, which is relatively unreliable, then I can still enter Israel. They should just tattoo a checkmark on my forehead.</p>

<p>A word from its creator:
PCR is not a test; it's a process. The frauds and medical board are misusing this process as a test. "PCR is just a process that's used to make a whole lot of something out of something. It cannot tell you that you're sick and it cannot tell you that the thing you ended up with was going to cause you 'dis-ease' or anything like that." - <strong>Kary Mullis, Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry</strong> for inventing the tool that carries out polymerase chain reaction process--PCR.</p>

You are not a naturopath if you don't understand how a PCR test works. Just because you were exposed to the virus and didn't contract it doesn't mean the test was faulty. The incubation period for the virus is up to 14 days depending on viral load.</p>

<p>Completely agree. They should not be mandating vaccines ever, but especially to women of child bearing age, with no knowledge of the affects on the placenta, especially with that high of a survival rate. And to top it all off, they are saying it doesn‚Äôt even stop transmission. So for me the risk is definitely not worth it. And legally they can not mandate something that is not FDA approved. So you could fight it.</p>

        <p>Yes that‚Äôs true it was never technically approved by the FDA, only through the emergency use authorization. If you know anything about PCR tests, they can adjust the sensitivity (measured in cycle rates). If you look up Kary Mulis on YouTube, he was the guy who created said test. He unfortunately passed away last year but from my understanding it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a very accurate way to track ‚Äúsick people‚Äù. The higher the cycle rate the more sensitive the tests are which can lead to high numbers of false positives. After all the protesting last summer (they estimated about ~20 million people gathered. If covid were as deadly and contagious as they say, you‚Äôd think that people woulda been dropping like flies or at least see a rise in cases. Didn‚Äôt really seem to happen. This covid thing has been fishy since day 1. The vaccine trials skipped animals and went straight to humans. Now I‚Äôm not a doctor but you don‚Äôt have to be to see through the bullshit of this whole narrative. Fauci changed his number on herd immunity multiple times. And they say the vaccine doesn‚Äôt even stop you from giving it or spreading it and that you‚Äôll need a booster every year. I think it‚Äôs quite clear big pharma and others are taking advantage of covid since day 1. First one shot, then two, then three, now one every year? I‚Äôll take my chances against a virus with a 99.98% survival rate. No thanks.</p>

        <p>Sorry what do you mean by cycles? 
I looked up pfizer data sheets and it seems like they did tests on rats, but a lot of the information is inconclusive. When I spoke about herd immunity at the start of all this people thought I was crazy and not compassionate. Now it's a buzzword lol. Fauci said masks weren't a good idea because they make people touch their face more often and many people don't sanitize them. Now, two masks means double protection! Like condoms lol. We will need a booster. But it supposedly stops you from spreading or contacting it for about 6 months. Notice the drop in flu cases. Wonder how long this virus has actually been around...</p>

        <p>Yeah the flu thing is super sketchy. I work in the biggest hospital system in Chicago and we have combined all respiratory illnesses in one giant pool when tracking covid. Why is everyone trying to pump the numbers as much as they can? As for PCR test cycles I‚Äôm not an expert but to my understanding the cycle rate is the sensitivity. Most lab workers from what I‚Äôve heard believe anything over 25-30 is inaccurate. But the cycle rate has been between 30-45 Ive heard in many countries running tests, which would explain the high level of false positives. On my PCR test I took for work, it says you may have just had the common cold if you tested positive. Seems like a very bad way to track ‚Äúinfected‚Äù people. Also I don‚Äôt know if this is still being done but I know last summer they were throwing contact tracing into the pools as cases. Let‚Äôs say you test positive and you‚Äôve been around 5 people. Well they just added 6 to the total case number. The media then advertises this number and now people think everyone around them is a puss filled diseased rat. It‚Äôs literally propaganda.</p>

        <p>Yes, I see what you mean. It's approved for emergency use, but if you're younger covid poses no threat and it is by no means an 'emergency' that you take it. As well as this, there's not way they could've found long term effects of these vaccines without trialling long term. I too, am worried about vaccine passports, and was wondering if we could organise a movement where we act against it now.</p>
