    <strong>The incoming New Normal and Relationships</strong>
    <p><p>So this probably isn't the right type of post for this sub, but it is something that has been weighing heavily on my mind as we inch closer to this impending mandated vaccine passport dystopia world. </p>
<p>Me: conspiracy minded, will never take the vax or even another test (have taken a handful for medical appointments) just to be allowed to travel, enter a store, etc. </p>
<p>GF: works in travel industry remotely from home (cruise company corporate), normie, not a doomer but just goes along with what they're told, both parents got vax, they will probably get vax and travel, etc. </p>
<p>This is so unfortunate that this plandemic shit happened and has ruined lives and probably relationships. We've been together since fall 2018 and we were (or are) heading toward marriage path for sure.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know how a relationship with these dynamics could possibly work out and it kills me. Obviously I have tried to discuss the totalitarian dystopia conditions we are slowly creeping towards, but with no luck. I understand you cannot force someone to wake up and see what is happening, but I'm looking for any insight into how to handle this.</p>
<p>I think it'll come to a point somewhere soon where we need to have this discussion full stop and explain how we think these dynamics are going to effect our relationship and future. I've tried showing the Israel Green Pass, the NYC new digital passport pilot program, the international travel flight vax passports, etc. And especially with her being in travel she comes into contact with these issues from passengers, she is not oblivious to the next step. </p>
<p>Do you think it is possible for a relationship like this to work? </p>
<p>Hell I don't even know if I'd procreate with someone who gets the vax (we are 28 and 30 yr olds) due to the unknown mutation that could occur. At least wait a year + to take the vax and see the fallout. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any discussion.</p>
<p>TLDR: I won't ever get vax or another test just to travel, enter store, etc. GF, who works in travel, definitely will. Is this sustainable lol?</p></p>

        <p>Are you really 'conspiracy minded' or are you skeptical about the narrative?  It sounds like your concerns are well founded...except maybe the mutated baby part.  If anything, and I really hate to say it, it's more about infertility.  </p>
<p>IDK who can really answer this question for you.  If the topics keep coming up and you guys manage to not get into arguments then maybe you can just coexist.  I guess it depends on how much/if this noose keeps tightening around us cause then obv these topics are gonna come up more and more.</p>

        <p>Yes I am heavily into conspiracies but I feel I am being very realistic about the current situation we are facing. Honestly, she's a liberal but doesn't care about politics or news, etc. She just lives her life and doesn't partake in all that bullshit. It's a good balance I feel between my views and having someone to keep me grounded or provide opposing views too. I don't judge someone by their politics, views, etc. We are humans. </p>
<p>But yeah, that noose tightening is definitely going to lead to some unpleasant but necessary conversations and truths. Thanks for the input. I agree about the infertility part, that's more what I meant lol.</p>

<p>This mentality makes zero sense to me. Do you not possess moral preferences? Do you think right and wrong are just subjective concepts?</p>
<p>Political views can tell you a lot about someone's character. "We are humans", yes, but some humans are better than others. Not sorry, not sorry.</p>

        <p>Agree to disagree. Yeah I don't give a fuck about someone's political views, who they voted for, etc. As long as you are not in my face about it like some full-blown libtard idiot then ok, that's fine, I respect your opinion, like I'd hope you'd respect mine.</p>
<p>In my case, my gf doesn't even follow politics, news, etc. whatsoever. So yes, I don't care about her having different views than me. People are unique. People have different opinions. Life would be boring and scary with just one groupthink as we can see. I don't judge her based on her lack of interest in the subjects. Many people are happier not getting into any of this stuff since it's all negative bullshit anyway. Sometimes ignorance truly is bliss. I don't blame anyone for not wanting to just live life in the real world and as a good person. My gf is a wonderful, kind and loving person and we don't argue or fight at all. We both have the same values when it comes family and morals. This question I posed in the OP would be a truly abnormal occurrence in our relationship.</p>

        <p>This is extremely difficult for me too. My boyfriend is basically the same way. I think deep down he knows it’s all bullshit but for whatever reason has the ability and desire to “adapt” to the new normal, whereas I’m having an existential crisis daily as a result of all this nonsense. </p>
<p>In the beginning of this we got into arguments a lot about masks and the lockdown policy and I think he thought I was an idiot. Now we basically live under the understanding that we have to respect our differences as long as neither of us are being forceful or overly judgmental. I think that’s all we can do really: just accept their views as long as they don’t expect us to go along with all this garbage. It’s also good for us to not be dogmatic and pushy. </p>
<p>Hang in there! You never know, she may end up coming around when it’s the right time. I wish you luck!</p>

        <p>Oh dang, word for word this is my situation to the fullest. Boyfriend who deep down knows this is bs but goes along with the narrative, check. Me having daily crisis over people not seeing the agenda, check. It's crazy because sometimes he will say rational shit but then he falls back into kool aid talk like someone yanked him back into line. It's maddening.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly! Like the other day my gf said something about how she started using duck duck go instead of Google cause she as sick of Google following her everywhere and shit lol. I was thrilled. And we agreed about the invasion of privacy. But then I try to bring up vaccine passports and the whole invasion of privacy issue just disappears apparently.</p>

        <p>I know! My boyfriend will literally make fun of people wearing masks alone in their car, but then other day he starts to put one on before we had even gotten to the store. I asked him why he was doing it and he starts trying to rationalize why.... I just don't get how their minds connect the dots.</p>

        <p>I couldn't do it personally, I think having a similar world view is very important in your life partner, especially now during this unveiling. This past year has really created a seismic shift in consciousness - those vibrating on the denser frequency and those expanding their awareness further. I don't mean to be a downer, but I think it's only going to get more difficult going forward and you're probably better off moving on. I had a similar thing happen when I "awoke" to conspiracies and esoterics in 2016. My boyfriend at the time couldn't handle me at all, and we broke up and my life improved vastly. My life now looks NOTHING like it did that back then, all for the better, and would never have happened if I had bit my tongue and stayed with him. He's not changed at all (at least judging by his blog and social media), and I'm living on another continent in a different reality.</p>
<p>It's your choice, obviously, but I would recommend really listening to that intuition during meditation. It is telling you something, and even you just soliciting advice on this subreddit is indicative of what it's hinting at...</p>
