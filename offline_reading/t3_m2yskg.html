        <p>Bad attempt at analogizing seatbelts to mask mandates.  The seatbelt wearer chooses to wear it to protect themselves from a crash that if happened would have a high likelihood of injury.  </p>
<p>A mask mandate insists that I should wear one to protect you. It is a flawed concept. 
1.  I’m not sick. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you need protection wear a mask. Don’t make me. </p>

<li>
<p>Fauci himself said masks don’t work the way people think they do. Data shows this through the mask mandates. </p>

<p>If you have a high probability of being injured by covid you shouldn’t even leave your house of the case and death counts are accurate.</p>

        <p>In response to your points </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You're actually saying that you will not be sick in the next 2 weeks. Not sure how you know that but it is the implication of your statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This <strong>directly</strong> and blatantly contradicts your first and second paragraph. </p>

<li>
<p>This is in reference to your misunderstanding (see point 2)</p>

<p>This is your good argument. However, it does not address those with a normal probability of contracting covid, only high risk.</p>

        <p>While I love the fact that people think critical and question decisions, you might not be aware of some facts and thus came to the wrong conclusions. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You might be sick and not know it. Even during the incubation time you are already highly contagious despite not feeling sick at all. The fact is: you can't know. You can believe you're healthy, but you really wouldn't know. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This would require FFP2 / N95 masks and a face shield to even be remotely effective. And that's assuming people don't touch themselves anywhere, keep sanisiting their hands and belongings constantly etc. - which brings me to the next point:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fauci did say that, yes. And what he meant is exactly what you are displaying here: especially surgical masks are primarily helpful when worn by sick people, so that they don't spread the virus. They are much less efficient for people walking amongst sick, trying to protect themselves. Surgical masks primarily protect OTHERS from you. That's why it is very self-centered to not wear one, because everyone wearing it potentially protects you, but you don't reciprocate it. Coming back to the first point: because you don't know whether you're sick or not, the states tell you: wear a mask anyways, just in case, so the spread stops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correct, if you are highly vulnerable you should isolate yourself. But the problem is: many people who believe they are healthy, unknowingly have one or more preconditions that make them vulnerable. And many people who actually are healthy, still can get a serious case of covid leaving them with long term consequences or even death.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Covid is a highly infectious and dangerous illness. As with every illness, many people survive and many have little to no long term consequences - but that doesn't mean it's harmless. With tens of millions infected and hundreds of thousands dead, let's play it safe for a few more months until vaccination rates are high enough to keep the virus from spiraling out of control again. To protect our parents, siblings, children, friends and all the people who already suffered enough. </p>
<p>I hate this situation, I hate wearing masks, I want to go out again like before the pandemic - and we will be able to. We just need to be sensible for another few months. Let's beat this together.</p>

        <p>You certainly can be frightened if you want, but I don't think that will really help anyone. Being obedient to the laws would be great, yeah. You can get involved in politics, speak to your representatives etc if you believe a law should be changed, but nobody should take the law into their own hands. That's not how democracy works. </p>
<p>Also: masks are not taking freedom away, the virus is. Masks are helping to give us back control and freedom until a proper solution (vaccines) is in place.</p>

        <p>These are consequences of the virus. Technically a fire in a club isn't forcing the people to evacuate and close the club early for the night either, it's people. </p>
<p>But as most other countries in the world have shown: the measures work and they have far fewer cases and deaths. </p>
<p>If you then add in proper medical coverage and free healthcare as well as a social security that people can live on, you don't get communism but a society that keeps functioning and doesn't have record suicide rates even through harsh lockdowns. </p>
<p>The virus is the cause but ignoring it will not make it go away. Ignoring it won't make less people end up in the hospital and ignoring it won't save people from dying. Ignorance will worsen these outcomes. If everyone had just worn a damn mask from the beginning, lockdowns might not even have been necessary at this scale.</p>

        <p>That is a great mindset! Never just accept what someone tells you, to be always criticial :) what's important to know is: he did not just change his opinion out of the blue but when doctors ran experiments and collected enough data that showed the efficiency of masks with this virus, then he changed his recommendation. </p>
<p>That's not the point where you restart your experiments. They already did the tests, multiple labs all over the world independently from each other. And they came to the same conclusion. If you question what Fauci said, that's when you look at the sources.</p>
<p>This is one of many such scientific papers giving the answers to all your why's, explaining the reasons, their test findings, which researchers were involved in the paper etc: https://spj.sciencemag.org/journals/research/2020/7286735/</p>

        <p>That just tells me how masks are <em>supposed</em> to work. It gives me no hard numbers if <em>they actually work</em>.

        <p>That... Is not what that means. Did you read the previous paragraph? It's about looking at the efficacy of masks as an instrument to fighting the pandemic. The studies showed that masks work well as a PPE, but due to ethical reasons, having a dedicated control group which is not wearing masks at all, is not an option. So they have to look at weaker (mixed) data sets to find their results. So they are saying they need more comprehensive data to get better results in regards to a statement of how effective masks really are as a method of fighting the virus. While it is effective (and other respiratory illness studies have confirmed this too), they can't with certainty say how effective.</p>

        <p>The fact that they're stating any sort of conclusion despite not even having a control group in the experiment is a very obvious sign that the conclusion was predetermined.  Any actual scientist would not have drawn any meaningful conclusion from the data available.</p>

        <p>This whole "it's just like the flu" narrative should have died off when half a million people died in the US alone. Yet it didn't. It's not the flu. You don't have to be careful with every germ and every virus. But some are so dangerous you should take precautions. Covid by itself isn't that deadly. It gets so deadly due to the huge mass of people that it infects. That is what we need to control it. </p>

        <p>I don't care whether COVID is similar to the flu or not, it's just an analogy that can be made for any respiratory virus, no matter how dangerous. It's not my responsibility to prevent others from getting sick, nor is it my fault if they do get sick.</p>

<p>This is the problem with your argument - the moral standard you are trying to impose is just arbitrarily determined.</p>

        <p>Whether you assume responsibility over getting others sick or not depends a lot on your culture too. In Japan for example if you have a cold, you're expected to wear a mask to protect others. For decades before Covid-19. In the western hemisphere the mindset is significantly more self-centered.</p>
<p>But once millions of lives are at stake, the government has to intervene and do something. That's when it's not your choice anymore. Same as with driving under the influence. It's your right to drink (when you're old enough), but if you drink too much, you're not allowed to drive anymore because you put other's lives at risk. Same with mask mandates: you're allowed to roam around outside, unless you're refusing to wear a mask, then you're not anymore. The comparison isn't great, but what I'm trying to show is: freedom is never limitless. Your freedom ends where it impacts someone else's freedom. And in a special situation such as we have it right now, a little consideration can go a long way.</p>

        <p>Sure, but not asymptomatic people. People in Japan chuck a mask on when they feel sick, they aren't expected to <em>always</em> wear a mask because they <em>may</em> be sick without realising and <em>may</em> infect someone else. We have some considerations here in the West - we find it polite to cough or sneeze into our hands or elbows, to wash our hands after using the bathroom, to avoid kissing grandma if we feel a bit under the weather, etc. But what we are doing now is complete insanity.</p>
<p>To expand on your analogy, imagine if the government told you that you cannot drive because you <em>may</em> not be fit to drive without realising it. So for the safety of others, they just place a blanket ban on everyone driving to prevent people from dying in traffic accidents. Then when someone does go out and drive against the rules, you morally shame them for <em>potentially</em> getting someone killed.</p>
<p>&rt;Your freedom ends where it impacts someone else's freedom.</p>
<p>No one's freedom is being impacted by people not wearing masks. People are more than free to wear their own masks, to stay home and avoid gatherings, to sanitise and wash their hands and all manner of other health practices, if they wish. That is entirely up to them, that is their freedom to do so. Their health is in their hands.</p>
<p>Do you support a mandate for people to wash their hands? To arrest or fine people who did not sanitise their hands recently?</p>

<p>Not before Covid, but ever since Covid? They sure do. And it shows. Japan has 67 deaths per 1 Million, the US have 1600.  That has to do with a lot of factors (affordable health care, not telling your people it's a fake virus that will go away, very low obesity rates) but a huge factor has also been the compliance with mask wearing and social distancing. Japan had a relatively short lockdown period and live has mostly resumed already. Because people didn't doubt masks, they were used to it. And Japan is only one of several countries that did exceedingly well. Same goes to Singapore and Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam and others. Strangely all in Asia, were masks are common.</p>
<p>&rt;To expand on your analogy, imagine if the government told you that you cannot drive because you may not be fit to drive without realising it. So for the safety of others, they just place a blanket ban on everyone driving to prevent people from dying in traffic accidents.</p>
<p>If there is a disease going around that causes people to suddenly not be fit for driving, that has already led to thousands of people being dead and we have no solution to it yet, yes, that would make a lot of sense to prevent unnecessary casualties. </p>
<p>&rt;No one's freedom is being impacted by people not wearing masks.</p>
<p>What about their freedom of bodily integrity? Even if they wear a mask and isolate, they still need to get groceries. And if an anti masker who just happened to have Covid gets up close, suddenly that person is at risk despite doing everything right. But because people are too selfish to respect the freedom of someone's bodily integrity, now they are still at risk. This isn't a hypothetical scenario, there are plenty of videos on youtube where this kind of shit happens. </p>
<p>Look at Japan or other Asian countries and ask yourself: what are they doing so much better than the US? </p>
<p>&rt;Do you support a mandate for people to wash their hands? To arrest or fine people who did not sanitise their hands recently?</p>
<p>If that was the best way to tackle this pandemic, I would. It's such a risk/effort/reward situation. Low risk, low effort, high reward. A mask does not cost much money, it is very little effort to wear, a minor inconvenience to me and it can save lives. Same goes to washing hands. How selfish can some people be that they'd rather risk people getting sick and dying for a tiny bit more convenience?</p>

        <p>OK, I have a lot to unpack here, and it's sort of swaying from the topic at hand, but I think it is worth addressing anyway.</p>
<p>Firstly, your measurement of success is meaningless to the argument you are making. You are talking about infection rates among the population and how it correlates to mask-wearing, but you are using death rates per million. Infection rates per million is a much better metric for you to use.</p>
<p>So let's look at infections per million. Japan has an infection rate of 3,500 per million, while the US has an infection rate of 90,000 per million. But the number of infections is dependant on how rigorous you are with testing, so you have to consider how many tests they are conducting. Japan has a test rate of 69,500 per million, while the US has a test rate of 1,125,000 per million. The US is actually testing <em>a lot</em> of people more than once, so of course, they are going to find more infections.</p>
<p>The US has one of the highest mask compliance rates in the world, and they also have one of the highest death and infection rates in the world. Seroprevalence studies also determined that 50% of Tokyo were infected with COVID all the way back in September of 2020, so it doesn't look like masks have done anything to prevent infection there, it's just a lack of testing responsible. The study in Japan tested for antibodies, while the testing in the US uses PCR, which is likely to produce a significantly higher number of infected individuals. If you think masks are in any way correlated with COVID success, you are kidding yourself. Japan's death rates are low because of other factors at play. Australia and New Zealand also did really well, at 35 deaths and 5 deaths per million respectively, and we weren't wearing masks here back in March. India has a death rate of 114 per million, and we know how unsanitary their conditions are. What do you think all these countries have in common to be able to hold such ridiculously low death rates? It isn't the masks and social distancing, it's the proximity with China.</p>
<p>But anyway, the efficacy of masks is not the topic at hand here, it's the morality of spreading infections among the public.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;If there is a disease going around that causes people to suddenly not be fit for driving, that has already led to thousands of people being dead and we have no solution to it yet, yes, that would make a lot of sense to prevent unnecessary casualties.</p>
<p>So why not apply that same standard to the flu? The flu kills thousands of people each year, does it not make sense to restrict people from spreading the flu? Should we have been morally shaming people for living a regular life prior to March of 2020? By your own standard, we should have been.</p>
<p>These are the questions I asked earlier that you cannot answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Why don't we have to be careful with every virus? Why am I morally responsible for [the] deaths of people by spreading COVID, but not by spreading the flu? By what measure are we determining whether a virus is dangerous or not? Some arbitrary number? What if we disagree on that measure?"</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no consistency with your moral argument other than arbitrary hysteria, which is why you see so many people in life not agreeing and/or complying with your assessment. Why have you set this moral standard so suddenly? Why not set it retroactively? Why does it only apply to COVID and nothing else?</p>
<p>&rt;But because people are too selfish to respect the freedom of someone's bodily integrity, now they are still at risk.</p>
<p>Again, the same thing applies to the flu, but your moral argument does not, for some reason. Do you think we should ban smoking? Second-hand smoking kills 41,000 people in the US per year, according to Google. There are people dying from smoking every time they go out to get groceries, despite doing everything right. Shouldn't your moral argument apply to that too?</p>
<p>&rt;How selfish can some people be that they'd rather risk people getting sick and dying for a tiny bit more convenience?</p>
<p>Mate, they are about as selfish as you were your entire life prior to March 2020.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm going to call it here. Thanks for the conversation, but I do not think there is a lot of sense in continuing since you've dodged the question once already, and attempted to change the subject once already, and the factual argument you made with regards to comparisons between Japan and the US were faulty in their logic. I don't think there is a lot of healthy progress to encroach on here.</p>
<p>Cheers mate, have a good one.</p>

        <p>It is just like the flu. The flu kills and hospitalises multiple people a year. Its just this is a novel virus that it doesn't help that lockdowns prevent excersising and damage mental health which both impacts immune system. There have been Scientists have said that daily exposure to the pathogens of the outside world is important for immunity but these Scientists get silenced as fake news for not supporting the agenda. It also doesn't help that governments measure Deaths 30 days after a positive covid test. As a final point data has shown that 80percent of people that die from covid  is overweifht/obesity. Being fat is the highest casue of death each year yet the government doesn't stop people from living because of it.... hmmmm maybe if we want to solve the fatdemic in America we should just fear mongering until the government forces every to lose Weight.</p>

        <p>That's what you guys tell yourselves, right? Being critical thinkers while gobbling down everything some shady dude from the YouTube college is throwing out there.</p>
<p>Look at the numbers of countrys that followed the covid codes strictly (China, Australia, New Zealand,..) and look at your own. You are no critical thinkers you're just narcisists blaming once again the world for their lack of common sense and empathy.</p>

        <p>Did half a million people die on 9/11? If they did, and you could save most of them would you? If you would, and all you had to do was put a piece of cloth in front of your nose and mouth to save them would you?
I reckon you wouldn’t. Can’t be asked to do the bare minimum for the betterment of everyone. Like putting a shopping cart back in one of the cart stalls in the parking lot of a store.</p>

        <p>That's not a problem of quarantining in general but how it's implemented. You tell low income people to stay home, to not work, but when they need money it's "fuck you" and the government keeps handing tax breaks to billionaires instead, saying there is no money for supporting the poor. Yeah, that will frustrate a lot of people. These are just the tip of the iceberg. I bet millions are affected by some sort of mental issues following long isolation and feeling neglected or forgotten by their government. And some of these billionaires having pharma companies pushing hard for opioids for many years was also not helpful either.</p>

        <p>Seatbelts are primarily mandated for insurance reasons. In reality people couldn’t give a shit if you didn’t wear one and got into an accident. </p>
<p>Also seatbelts don’t restrict breathing, talking, eating or facial communication. The comparison is pointless.</p>

        <p>Mask don’t restrict breathing. Seatbelts nothing to do with insurance. </p>
<p>If ppl are so against mask why wear seatbelts or helmets on bikes. The government has been making laws about safety for ever.</p>
<p>This outrage against it is pathetic. Oh no the government is telling me I have to wear mask boohoo. </p>
<p>They tell you how fast you can go, when to stop and go in traffic, what’s allowed in food and water supplies. </p>

        <p>Yes they do, and seatbelts laws were created because otherwise insurance premiums would be sky high. This is all public info.</p>
<p>Again, people wouldn’t be as upset if you had to place a piece of cloth on your shirt, its the wearing of a mask which is annoying as fuck to do anything in. Half the people I know are muffled when they speak.</p>
<p>You’re fine to keep wearing one like a sheep. Normal people won’t.</p>

<p>The fact that you believe all scientists around the world are in consensus about, well, anything at all, much less something they are very much not in consensus about like covid, is a massive red flag.  </p>

<p>Is it?  Or have you just been told by "journalists" that it is.  The wording of this statement tells me it's the latter, because we very much lack the data needed to make many conclusive statements at all about the proper response to the covid pandemic.</p>

        <p>I think you replied to the wrong comment, but yeah, for a while there it was like any dissenting opinion was being scrubbed from the internet and media within 24 hours, especially if it was coming from an actual physician or clinical researcher with medical expertise.  </p>
<p>Its becoming less restricted where I am, and holy shit, there is basically no consensus at all among doctors and scientists about anything but the existence of the virus.  All the talk on proper government response is just speculation and opinion.  There are, however, an awful lot of doctors and scientists saying Fauci is a dedicated capitalist masquerading as a public health expert who shouldn't be taken seriously by the general public.</p>

        <p>But your individual liberty is not above that of others, the mask does not smother unless you already have a breathing impediment in which case you should look that up. You have the liberty to shoot a gun (provided you have everything in order), but when you hit others with the bullet, you will respond for your actions. Your individual liberty is not above the safety of others.</p>

        <p>Do you even understand the point of masks? They are supposed to mainly protect others not yourself.</p>
<p>The average person is not careful enough with masks. Since the mask filters what you would breathe, you should not touch the mask without cleaning hands, etc first, because you would be touching exactly what it’s supposed to be filtering and infecting youself either way. This was the reason why major news outlets and doctors were against the use of masks at first, because people were not careful enough with masks. Not that they “didn’t work”.</p>
<p>However what they did observe is that using a mask limits the “range” of your expiration, therefore protecting others in case you are infected. Therefore, by washing your hands, sanitizing them and removing the mask the right way, you are indeed protecting yourself and others. And if others use the mask they will also be protecting you.</p>

        <p>I looked it up at Snopes:</p>
<p>Cloth and surgical masks do not protect the wearer from airborne infection. Cloth masks also get dirty easily, which is why OSHA and CDC recommend regular washing.</p>
<p>However, contrary to the posts, OSHA and CDC have not recommended against wearing face coverings of any kind. Also contrary to the posts, cloth and surgical masks are not entirely ineffective because they prevent the wearer from transmitting infection to others through droplets. Surgical masks also protect wearers from getting potential infections via droplets. In addition, people who wear these masks are in little to no danger of breathing in too much carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>So basically those masks do protect you. Try to keep up.</p>

        <p>Ah so cloth masks do not filter your breath like you stated before. And if my breath is still being projected and it’s not filtering anything, then is stopping some sneeze droplets really going to do anything? Besides, who the hell isn’t covering their own sneeze other than young children? You don’t think the public can be trusted with such an excruciating and difficult task such as covering their sneeze? Do you need them to wipe your ass too?</p>

        <p>How do you know? The reason why Covid-19 spread so quickly is because the symptoms appear after the contamination period, meaning you can contaminate before feeling sick. That’s why you can’t know.</p>
