        <p>I did. This is what I commented to OP. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Whose lives? The ones who would have died from the flu? Or the 104 year old who survived Rona? Or the lady who survived the spanish flu AND rona? Or the Canadian senior that was euthanized to avoid a second lockdown.</p>
<p>This is all bullshit, you just like the feeling of being "morally superior".</p>
<p>Besides if I wanted to get Rona should I be allowed to do that?</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>If you answered no, then you are dangerous. You are someone who tries to take away peoples freedoms for other peoples safety.</p>
<p>Do you think the soldiers rushing vimy ridge were concerned with freedom or safety? They fought for freedom.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin once said: "<strong>Those</strong> who <strong>would give up</strong> essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary <strong>Safety</strong>, <strong>deserve neither</strong> Liberty <strong>nor Safety</strong>."</p>
<p>I imagine this quote was going through the heads of those who were fighting the British, to gain freedom ... not safety.</p>
<p>Sometimes being safe is the wrong choice. I will fight for freedom while you fight for "safety""</p>

        <p>You know, I want to tell those boys not to call people fat bitches but apparently she walked up to two <em>children</em> (because yes, teenagers are children still) and reprimanded them for existing when they were doing absolutely nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Does she go around telling teenage girls to wear longer shorts ? Does she let kids who are spending their allowance on pizza and burgers that they need to eat healthier ? Is she bothered children as young as my own two are as well (6&amp;9)? Is she going to come get upset with me for sneezing in public because I have allergies ?</p>
<p>So yeah. If she's going to butt into people's lives for absolutely no reason, <em>children's</em> lives no less - she deserves whatever reply they give her.</p>
<p>Last time someone butt into my kids life I was seeing red and screamed at her to fuck off about three times as she followed me like a goddamn weirdo.</p>
