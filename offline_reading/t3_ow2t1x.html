    <strong>We The Screamers</strong>
    <p><p>Arthur Koestler wrote this is 1944, describing what it was like for he and other activists to try and get people to understand the Nazis were really, truly trying to kill every Jew in Europe.</p>
<p>No one believed them.</p>
<p>" WE, the  screamers, have been at it now for about ten years. We started on the  night when the epileptic Van der Lubbe set fire to the German  Parliament; we said that if you donâ€™t quench those flames at once, they  will spread all over the world; you thought we were maniacs. At present  we have the mania of trying to tell you about the killing, by hot steam,  mass-electrocution and live burial of the total Jewish population of  Europe. So far three million have died. It is the greatest mass-killing  in recorded history; and it goes on daily, hourly, as regularly as the  ticking of your watch. </p>
<p>The facts have been published in pamphlets, White Books, newspapers,  magazines and what not. But the other day I met one of the best-known  American journalists over here. He told me that in the course of some  recent public opinion survey nine out of ten average American citizens,  when asked whether they believed that the Nazis commit atrocities,  answered that it was all propaganda lies, and that they didnâ€™t believe a  word of it. "</p>
<p>Feels like right now.</p>
<p>We are the screamers, and we must keep screaming.</p></p>
