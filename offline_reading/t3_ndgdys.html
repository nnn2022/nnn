    <strong>How are we the echo chamber?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ll never understand why people think we’re the echo chamber. Sure theirs the occasional person that spouts some bullshit in the comments, but I’d say 95% of us just want freedom of choice. How are the people saying think for yourselves and choose what’s best for you, the bad guys? How is a group made up of conservatives, libertarians and liberals the divisive group? Sure we’ve got anti vaxxers, which I personally disagree with, but to each their own, you do you. We’ve also got people who are fully vaccinated and are strictly just against this particular “vaccine.” We’ve got people that think this is all a hoax, people that think the virus is real but overblown, and people like me that have seen first hand how this virus can affect someone they love and still think its unacceptable to do what has been done to try to stop it. All I want is to be able to make my own life decisions. I’ve got the full spectrum in my family. My sister refuses to go anywhere that doesn’t mandate masks, my dad puts a mask on if he’s asked, my mom begrudgingly puts a mask on if she’s told she has to, I refuse to do business with anyone that tries to make me wear a mask, and my kid brother refuses to associate with anyone wearing a mask. I love them all the same. The world would be such a better place if we just accepted that people are individuals. Do what’s best for you, live and let live. This group has honestly been a godsend for me. It’s really comforting to know that there are people out there that may not agree 100% with my beliefs but still accept me for who I am and respect me for standing up for what I believe in. So thank you all, yes even the people that will automatically hate me for this post. Thank you for showing me that we’re not all the same, without you we truly would be a dystopian cookie cutter society.</p></p>

        <p>It’s nuts. I am a former liberal dem , I now I lay claim to NO political party at all, to me COVID is real, I’ve lost people to it but they were not healthy individuals, I think it has been completely overblown for nefarious purposes. I’ve had a lot of vaccines personally, I am not an anti-VAXer and I am disgusted with being called one because I don’t want this particular vaccine for valid reasons. I’ve seen people here with a wide array of opinions. I don’t think negatively of anyone here even if I don’t agree with them. I think they need to call us an echo chamber because this is what they do, they compartmentalize. A lot of people (not all but a lot)who are pro lockdown, pro mask, and pro vaccine happen to be liberal Democrats, and leftists. The entire thrust of that party right now is all about identity politics. Dividing people by race gender sexuality,ethnicity etc. Their whole ideology is based on putting people into categories. They are controlling the narrative right now through our government and through our media so it only makes sense that they would do this. They can’t conceive of someone being multifaceted,They need to just put you in a neat little box and not think too much about who you really are. The idea that you could be against lockdowns and against masks but take the vaccine does not compute with them. I think we are just very different in the way we process information ,analyze it and organize it in our brains.</p>

        <p>I haven’t lost anyone, but my dad had it bad. My dad also has a super rare immune disease that essentially means he doesn’t have an immune system and frankly doesn’t take care of himself at all. He’s over weight and drinks and smokes too much. He’s sick all the time. It still took about 8 months for him to get it and he spent time in the hospital. It’s been months since he had it and still isn’t 100%, which is why when asked to do so he’ll put a mask on for other people regardless of his opinion. Even after all that he still believes it’s the individuals choice to do what they think is best. He has an appointment to get his vaccine, which honestly scares me because of his history, but he’s a grown man, and I won’t try to talk him out of it. He respects my decision not to get it and the only reason he’s upset with my sister for wanting to get it is that she’s pregnant. If he can make that decision it just blows my mind that the rest of us are supposed to be forced into this box if you’re this or you’re that. I know it’s a little anecdotal cause I’m speaking about my personal experiences with it and maybe even a little like I’m trying to make my family seem better than everyone else but I promise I’m not intending it to. We’re just such a wide range of opinions that I think we’re a good example of how it should look. Differing opinions respecting each other</p>

        <p>It’s a tactic of the powers that be to accuse their opposition of their own misdeeds. If they create an echo chamber, they accuse us of doing so. If the left creates policies that cause a racial disadvantage, they accuse the conservatives of it.</p>
<p>The idea is to keep your opposition too busy scrambling to defend themselves, so they can’t actually create new policy or speak about their ideas. So far, it’s been working.</p>

        <p>People who say we are an echo chamber have no idea what this sub is about. There is a lot we don't all agree upon. </p>
<p>Some of us think this is a grand conspiracy. Some of us think politicians, the media and companies are just being opportunistic.</p>
<p>Some of us think Covid 19 isn't real. Some of us think it's real but exaggerated. I have even seen people who feel it is a genuinely dangerous virus but that no one has the right to tell you how to handle your own health.</p>
<p>And that's just a couple examples.</p>
