    <strong>They Think Your Life Is Worth A Doughnut</strong>
    <p><p>And sadly for some of you doomers that's the case. Do you not fucking see how pathetically patronizing all this bribery and coercion is? If you're going to be swayed by the offer of free pastry then... well, you're actually probably one of the few people that NEEDS the fucking vaccine if that's a tantalizing offer you just can't pass up, so go right ahead.</p></p>

        <p>Actually, what's even more insulting is that the Doomers all went Day 1 to get the shot. That donut is for us!!! They are taunting us.</p>

        <p>Ok long story but it’s related to this donut bribery nonsense, bear with me here. For context, I’ve been married twice, and I’m a diabetic. My first wife’s name was Sandra (relevant later). </p>
<p>Back in the early 2000’s before the financial crisis, like 2005 or so, we were living in a two bedroom in New York; not the cheapest place to live at the time, and definitely wouldn’t be these days. Sandra and I had been married for a while, and we were thinking of getting some new appliances since our old ones were wearing down. She wanted to get this mini deep firer you can make donuts in, but we didn’t really need a one and it took up a ton of space.</p>
<p>I remember this was around flu season, and she was really terrified of needles so she never got vaccinated. At the time I had some pretty wacky views, so I told her we could go ahead with the deep frier if she went and got vaccinated. Basically the same thing they’re doing out there now. I was a different person back then.</p>
<p>So she went and did it, and it didn’t go super well, to put it lightly. We got that frier pretty much the next day, but a couple of weeks later and she just breaks out in hives. Scariest thing I’d ever seen, I was mortified. She could barely do anything for like, two weeks, and all because of whatever was in that shot they gave her. I was mortified</p>
<p>So, back to the donuts and the frier. A couple of months go by, and I’m looking at my reflection in the frier while she’s just going to town of my butthole with a rubber fist, and Sandra stops for a sec and goes “your asshole looks like a glazed donut right now”. Can you believe that shit? Unbelievable. Divorced her the next day.</p>
