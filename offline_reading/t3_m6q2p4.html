    <strong>Anyone from Minnesota? And how do you go about not wearing a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>(Or states that have similar mandates) if so, how do you go about not wearing a mask? I’m a 17 year old and I only wear a mask cuz I want people to leave me alone. I hardly go out any place because nothing is enjoyable anymore. I’m forced to wear one at school and work. Work I’m okay with since I at least get paid to wear it. The governor here sucks and refuses to lift the mask mandate because it’s “dangerous” I saw one guy not wearing a mask at all and my friends made fun of him.</p>
<p>What do you do in public not wearing one? I’ve seen some advice on here and it has been making me want to not wear one when I’m not forced to (at school or work) I would like to encourage others to not wear one too. How do you respond to someone who yells at you/ harasses you for not wearing one? Just not respond? If it was a person who worked at a store and politely asked me to put one on I would comply, since they have to follow that rule anyway and I don’t believe in being rude to people at all. But I’d like advice about what to do if someone who isn’t paid to be nice starts harassing me for not wearing one. </p>
<p>PS-Thank you all for being a safe place for me :) any other sub is filled with mostly COVID propaganda and drives me crazy.</p></p>

        <p>Holy shit. The first you thing you have to start doing is.......not giving a fuck. You have to stop caring what people think, what people say, how people look at you, etc. etc. This is why we find ourselves in the current situation that we are in. The only thing millions of people are concerned with is, what everyone around them thinks about them. Social status, fitting in, trying to avoid criticism at all costs and on and on. Social media has created a world of people who are defined by upvotes and likes. We have to stop worrying about being "cancelled". We have to stop running from confrontation with the people who think they can run around and tell everyone how to live their lives. We do not have true freedom anymore. We haven't for a very long time. However, we do have more freedoms than most other parts of the world. We are losing more everyday but, there is plenty to be thankful for. But, to truly be as free as you deserve to be, you have to stop giving a shit. I believe in always being respectful. I am a responsible human being. I take care of my family but, I absolutely do not give a damn about what people think about me or what I choose to do in my daily life. Just go live your life. Mask free. If you get hassled for it in a store or a restaurant or wherever, find another store. Find another restaurant. Don't sacrifice what you believe in. Don't make exceptions. Go out and you do you.</p>

        <p>Thank you, that is really good advice. Growing up I’m this culture isn’t easy. Especially being young and older generations thinking they are smarter/better than me. But I will try my best from now on not to care how other people see me as that has been something I struggled with even before COVID. I think it will help give me more confidence to stand up for what I believe in and not care what people think</p>

        <p>Depends on what part of Minnesota you're in. The rural areas don't seem to have much going on in the way of mask Nazis.</p>

        <p>I live in a rural town, but by a larger city with mixed opinions on it.  you're way more likely to run into a mask nazi in the bigger city nearby. I work at a gas station in the small town I live in and there's a lot of customers who dont wear masks. I've personally only witnessed 3 doomers at work upset about people not wearing a mask/ upset at me (a cashier) for not telling them to put one on. But going to the larger city is pretty much essential, as the small town only has two gas stations and no grocery stores, plus, I like to go to stores that have interesting stuff in them besides a gas station lol. It is nice tho, there is 2 restaurants I know of  that are crowding with maskless people- which is nice and I like to support them for that.</p>

        <p>Fake mask USA. </p>
<p>There is one place I have to patron because they are literally the only place in town I can get a certain product, but they are super-doomers, so I can't do it without a muzzle. So I found the most insultingly fake transparent mask possible. They get even angrier than when you don't wear a muzzle at all</p>

        <p>I'm in the Mpls/St. Paul area and I'm SO over this crap. I don't find joy in any situation that masks are involved and nothing is fun anymore, so I understand how you feel.</p>
<p>People outside the metro area don't care as much if you don't wear a mask and it's easier to go maskless in these areas. I have not been brave enough to do this where I live out of fear that I'll end up on the internet and get publicly shamed. I frequently let my face covering fall down while shopping though but will pull it back up if someone tells me to. If you see someone else not wearing one, maybe pull yours off too and/or let them know you support them. I always immediately remove my face covering upon leaving a store. I will not wear it a second longer than I have to and I refuse to wear one outside (and that includes parking lots/ramps/garages). The more people wear masks outside, the more normalized a faceless society become.</p>
<p>Regarding schooI: I would not try being a maskless lone wolf in school as a protest statement (because it will only get you in trouble), but if other students agree with you, go to the administration and/or have your parents threaten to pull you out because of the mask rules. School districts do not want to lose students. If you do distance learning, maybe continue to do distance learning (if that's an option). In-person school looks like it sucks right now anyways. I think that it would be great if people refused to work and go to school as long as they are forced to wear masks, but that's risky because people could end up losing their jobs.</p>
<p>If someone yells at you, don't yell in return. Calmly remind them that yelling forcefully expels the the droplets that carry Covid and if they cared about spreading Covid, the best thing they could do would be to keep their distance and breathe quietly. If you're in a store and are politely asked to pull your mask up, I'd comply. Walking away also works. </p>
<p>I too am SO happy and grateful this Reddit community exists. Almost my entire social group is pro-mask and pro-restrictions and I need to vent to people who understand and won't attack me for having a different opinion and questioning the CDC. My family and close friends know I hate masks and still love me though:). What part of MN are you in?</p>

        <p>I’m sorry couldn’t imagine what the cities are like in this time, I haven’t been there since before this virus was even a thing. Also, I’m afraid of getting publicly shamed as well. When I go to the gas station I work at when I’m not working, I know all the managers won’t say anything cuz they don’t care. At school I normally keep my mask below my nose as other students do as well. The teachers rarely say anything about it but I have the assumption a lot of them are brainwashed into the system. I want to distance learn, but my parents want me to be in school. I know I focus a lot better in school but I did just fine distance earlier this year, I got good grades as usual. I’m trying to convince my parents to let me distance learn tho cuz they just made the restrictions in school more strict and it’s annoying. Most of my family don’t like masks either so it’s nice having in person support. My mom wants to start going maskless places now and I will probably go with her to see how she deals with it. I’m from southern MN, the Mankato area. There’s a fine mix between the rural people who could care less but wear one just because they have to.</p>
