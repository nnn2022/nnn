    <strong>“It’s not the flu!”</strong>
    <p><p>From what I can find online, the annual vaccination rate for the flu is between 45-55%. We've always heard that the flu shot's effectiveness was variable because they were targeting it to the flu strain they expected to be dominant that year. So, when the flu shot was ineffective, it was because of a failure on the part of the vaccine and those who developed it for that year. I have never heard the argument that the flu shot is ineffective because half of the people don't get it. </p>
<p>Now, we are hearing that exact argument not only about the covid vaccine, but it's being applied to <em>all</em> vaccines. "No vaccine is 100% effective. Everyone has to get it for it to work." They are even saying this about polio and measles. </p>
<p>I've never had a flu shot. I've also never experienced people blaming a flu season on unvaccinated people or attributing a weak flu vaccine response to the half of the population who don't get a flu shot. The flu shot has always been seen as personal protection that may or may not be effective year-to-year, but entirely limited to the shot, itself, and the person who gets the shot.</p></p>

        <p>Its just the ministry of truth rewriting science, history and everything else they need to in order to keep the narrative going, fortunately for them the useful idiots can only hold one thought at a time so the last thing they said is "fact"</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them a lot of people know "science" and "communicable disease" also happened before Jan 2020 and despite their attempts to cover up and censor can still call them out on their bullshit lies</p>

        <p>I’ve never gotten a flu shot and I haven’t had the flu in about 10 years. Why? Because I am active, fit, get sunshine, eat good food, and wash my hands when they’re dirty.</p>
