    <strong>The Curious Case of Jon Rahm and the Doomers</strong>
    <p><p>Many folks here will recall the story of Jon Rahm, the professional golfer who, just two months ago, was forced to withdraw from the Memorial Tournament due to a positive covid test--despite having a huge lead at the time and being a virtual lock to win the tournament. Rahm had only just been vaccinated a few days prior, so naturally the doomers were positively gleeful at this turn of events: "serves him right. That's what you get for not getting vaccinated in time. He knew the rules beforehand. He put people's lives at risk!" And all the other typical moralistic blathering...</p>
<p>Rahm spent the next couple weeks bravely fighting this horribly virulent disease (read: he had no symptoms and felt fine the whole time), then resumed play a couple weeks later and ended up winning the U.S. Open Championship. A truly miraculous recovery.</p>
<p>But now the latest part in this saga...today we learn that Jon Rahm--who keep in mind has been both vaccinated <em>and</em> naturally exposed to covid--has <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/jon-rahm-tests-positive-for-covid19-coronavirus-withdraw-from-tokyo-olympics-pga-tour-bryson-dechambeau-084221279.html">once again tested positive</a> for covid! As a result, he has been forced to withdraw from the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p>So what do the doomers have to say about this latest turn of events?</p>
<p>Well--as we can see from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/or7t9c/jon_rahm_tests_positive_for_covid19_again_and_is/">reddit thread on the golf subreddit</a>--the doomers realize the PCR test is completely bogus! In fact...they haven't <em>just</em> realized it...to hear them tell it, they've apparently known it was bogus the entire time! Fancy that! Just two months ago they were tripping over themselves taking turns excoriating the evil Jon Rahm--and yet, apparently, they knew even then that the tests were overly sensitive garbage.</p>
<p>Here are some choice comments from today's thread:</p>
<p>&rt;I work for the state in a care setting where I had direct input with the medical supervisor for the region. I inquired this with the supervisor when I contracted COVID-19 last year. I then supervised a COVID-19 quarantine unit. <strong>The medical department stated that I would test positive for COVID for up to 6 months with the amount they run the PCR test. They switched tests for the residents so they wouldn't test positive forever.</strong> (80 upvotes)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I tested positive for at least 3 weeks after having symptoms. The doctor that final cleared me for work said to stop wasting time/money in hopes for a positive test because it could be months (83 upvotes)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Everybody shitting on the testing protocol here has to understand that the IOC and Tokyo2020 don't care about false positives. They care about optics and liability.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>If they concede that Rahm is a false positive, then they have to also concede there are other likely false positives.</strong> To them, positive is positive and they can't afford to have loopholes.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This is zero tolerance testing. Context does not matter. (36 upvotes)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Rahm isn't sick, he's not going to get sick, and nobody around him that does get sick will have gotten sick because they were around Rahm.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Science gave the world several amazing vaccines in an unbelievably short time. <strong>Would be nice if science could also give the world a reliable way to differentiate between being infectious and a threat to others and having dead virus fragments in your system that trigger a positive PCR test.</strong> (133 upvotes)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So the man has never had a symptom, has had Covid twice and had been vaccinated. And won golfs toughest tournament in the week sandwiched between two bouts of the dreaded Covid.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Totally adds up. Lol (51 upvotes)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Sounds like the tests are bullshit.  (73 upvotes)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;PCR tests are trash (37 upvotes)</p>
<p>Fascinating, isn't it? Now, all of a sudden, everybody knows the truth--and in fact, they've known for a while--that the PCR test is garbage. Which begs the question...if they've known the whole time that it was garbage, what was with all the moral preening just two months earlier when Rahm first tested positive for covid? And why the continued shaming of unvaccinated athletes who test positive for covid, when they know the test is garbage?</p>
<p>It's almost as if this never had anything to do with health or safety, and this has been an ideological purity test the whole time.</p>
<p>The covid narrative is completely falling apart. And now the doomers--after having gleefully swallowed and parroted every aspect of the lie--are trying to play it off as if they <em>haven't</em> been pushing this garbage for a year and a half. "Of course the tests are unreliable! Duh! Doesn't everyone know that? We all knew that, right? (nervous laughter)"</p>
<p>Don't ever let these people off the hook. Constantly remind them of the hell they helped usher in.</p></p>

        <p>Remind me of all the "mystery" of the supposed "reinfections" within months back in early 2020 in Korea.</p>
<p>I myself did not know back that that the PCR was really an industrial manufacturing method.</p>

        <p>His response was that the test was “within 14 days of the jab” so the jab wasn’t working yet..</p>

        <p>It is incredible to me, their level of brazen hypocrisy and revisionist history.</p>

<p>Same with the lab leak hypothesis.</p>

<p>These people have absolutely no respect for intellectual honesty, have absolutely no consistency, and aren't even worried for a moment they might currently be repeating a bald faced lie.</p>
<p>It is sad and pathetic to watch.</p>
