    <strong>Masking alone outdoors</strong>
    <p><p>I took my girl to a local park the other day to walk around for a while. Not much else to do and it was a nice day. It’s a really popular park especially now. The amount of people walking around with masks on was startling. Pretty near half the people there were wearing masks just walking down a trail. We’d come walking by and most of them would duck off the trail to avoid being near us. Absolute clown world were living in.</p></p>
