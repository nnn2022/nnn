        <p>Hi, </p>
<p>Person of BMI 23 here. </p>
<p>I would agree with the statement that 'complete strangers are responsible for my health'. </p>
<p>By refusing to wear masks water droplets in your breath are put in the air which may or may not contain the highly contagious viral disease Covid-19. Regardless of whether or not I am wearing a mask, water droplets can still get in my eyes, face, or even my own mask, and spread the disease to me.</p>
<p>If you disagree with this, all I ask is that you explain, instead of smugly downvote and insulting me.</p>

        <p>I think that claiming masks are effective is irresponsible. It creates a false sense of security and encourages behaviour that might otherwise be avoided, car sharing for example.</p>
<p>My outlook on masks is this: </p>
<p>Surgical masks are designed to protect surgeon and patient from bodily fluids, they ate not intended to filter air. Try clamping one tight to your face and you will find breathing is very restricted. They will block droplet created when taking but that is it. Airborne virus particles will travel right around the mask along with 99% of the air that you breathe. The vape videos show this perfectly.</p>
<p>Cloth masks have no design standard and many have been shown to break down larger droplets as they pass through the mask causing them to remain in the air longer than they otherwise would.</p>
<p>N95 mask are effective but require training for proper use and need to be discarded after a few hours, since they have an electrical charge that helps trap particles which depletes over time. They are also expensive.</p>
<p>40 years of science has not led to the recommendation of public mask wearing for good reason. The most recent study from Denmark confirms this. And none of the data we have during this pandemic is able to detect any positive effect of mask wearing.</p>
<p>Mask mandates are BS and health authorities all over the world have failed by recommending them.</p>

<p>A huge chunk of the mask rules I've seen have been more about theatre than efficacy. They're a psychological aid.</p>
<p>A great example of this would be the restaurants where you have to wear a mask until you're seated, but then you can take it off and sit in an enclosed space with however many other people... if you understand at all how this works you'll know that the brief period of time you spend wearing a mask between the door and the table does nothing, nor does wearing masks in a saturated indoor environment protect the wait staff.</p>

        <p>The study is inconclusive. Therefore it doesn't prove the effectiveness of masks, nor does it disprove it. So basically, we're basing mandates with consequences on maybe, maybe not. There isn't actually any way to conduct a study on whether masks protect others, so we're putting our observational and lab studies up against years of evidence that they are ineffective against flu, which spreads the same way. Point is, we don't actually know if they're effective, the evidence is far too conflicting to justify mandates. Leave it up to the individual as it should have been from the start.</p>

        <p>No, that's not how the literature on masks works, nor is it how science works. This study was researching a specific question. The existing body of literature is already very clear that wearing masks is effective at protecting others. <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-masks-are-better-than-others-here-they-are-ranked-best-to-worst">Here</a> is a concise article from a reputable source that cites a number of original research articles, but it's also not hard to look into this yourself. <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2020/11/16/beaumont-study-shows-effectiveness-masks-covid-19-spread/6314336002/">Here's</a> a different article covering another study, as is <a href="https://www.king5.com/mobile/article/news/health/coronavirus/mayo-study-proves-effectiveness-of-masks-and-social-distancing/89-c5afee25-f2a3-4923-a41c-996ad0ff0373">this</a> and <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">this</a></p>
<p>Masks are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20092668/">also effective</a> against the flu, in the same way. <em>Masks protect those around the wearer.</em> Masks are less useful in protecting the wearer, which is the reason mandates are put in place (regardless of whether one agrees with them, that is the rationale). Exactly how effective they are at protecting the <em>wearer</em> is the  only inconclusive part, and there is preliminary evidence of at least some advantage to the wearer's safety too. The danish study adds to that body of research</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but it would help if you could provide the real-world proof for your assertion. I've seen no evidence that the pieces of cloth being worn are magic one-way filters that prevent your breath from spreading pathogens out, but are incapable of protecting you from incoming pathogens.</p>

        <p>I'm on your aside, I'm against this non sense.</p>
<p>But yesterday I was doing some research and was seeing that the data shows that less particles are transmitted through use of the mask. I'm not sure if we can deny that it's less, its probably more so an argument about how much less.</p>
<p>Either way, if it works or doesn't, doesn't matter. When you have states on full nut case lockdown declining at the same rate as states nearly fully open, it just shows that none of this matters.</p>

<p>Since you say you don't understand, places like your eyes can be infected. Masks don't cover your eyes; incidentally, this is the reason many medical professionals in high-risk environments are also wearing plastic face shields. Similarly, touching your face after touching a surface with the virus on it; hence the emphasis on handwashing/sanitizer</p>

        <p>You know what I noticed in many of those studies and research articles? That they were limited in scope, and some even flat-out said that real-world evidence was nearly impossible to gather. Most of these studies were done in labs and had people who had infections exhale into masks and then measured how much virus landed on its testing surface. Or worse, they set up dummy heads and blew mist through masks to measure the level of droplet transfer. Without the ability to know how much of that would be needed to transmit it to infect someone, it's just a whole lot of theory. From one of the links in the first article:</p>
<p>&rt; A recent study identified 10 RCTs that examined the effectiveness of facemasks on reducing influenza virus infection in the community from 1946-201811. The study did not distinguish estimates by the type of mask but did examine masks in combination with hand hygiene. The RCTs were heterogeneous across community settings ranging from Hajj pilgrims, university and households settings. In a pooled meta-analysis, the authors conclude that there was no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51-1.20, p=0.25). But notably, the authors state that: “most studies were underpowered because of limited sample size, and some studies also reported suboptimal adherence in the face mask group.”</p>
<p>&rt; They concluded that “<strong>In theory</strong>, transmission <strong>should be reduced</strong> the most if both infected members and other contacts wear masks, but compliance in uninfected close contacts could be a problem.”</p>
<p>Instead, we have almost eleven months of real-world experience showing little correlation between mask mandates and viral spread. It spreads in places like Florida where half the population doesn't distance or cover, and it spreads in places like Pennsylvania where 90% of the population cover at all times when away from home. North and South Dakota had nearly identical peaks of infection this past fall, with one state instituting restrictions and the other refusing to do so.</p>
<p>I've not seen actual proof that any of these theories and models work in the real world. And if elected officials are reducing or restricting our civil liberties, they should be required to show proof that their restrictions are effective.</p>

<p><em>This is how most experimental research works.</em> It's not ideal, but it's <em>absolutely standard across many fields of science.</em> That's also why we do observational study, like <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/small-data-big-implications">this meticulous Korean study</a> demonstrating that being maskless in a closed restaurant with recirculated air leads to increased spread with a very small amount of exposure</p>
<p>Emphasis in the wrong place, as if you're trying to be misleading. “In theory, transmission <strong>should be reduced</strong> <strong><em>the most</em></strong> <strong>if BOTH infected members AND other contacts wear masks</strong>, but compliance in uninfected close contacts could be a problem.” They're stating pretty clearly here that the largest reduction in transmission is expected when both an infected person and those around them <strong><em>are wearing masks.</em></strong></p>
<p>The UCSF article I included in my comment had multiple studies of mask mandates linked in the first few paragraphs, leading me to believe you didn't actually look at it.
But hey, here's some more: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ksdk.com/mobile/article/news/health/coronavirus/face-mask-mandates-effective-slowing-covid-19-study/63-0827084d-8e6b-4c80-92de-8f78b422de63">St Louis University</a> looks at mask mandate in St Louis vs surrounding counties — St Louis  &amp; SL county cases went down after mask mandate, while surrounding counties' numbers did not. I encourage you to read for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210207/mask-mandates-reduced-covid-hospitalizations">news brief</a> by a journalist with a master’s degree in health and medical journalism; covers multiple additional research articles including <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7006e2.htm?s_cid=mm7006e2_w">this CDC report</a> demonstrating that mask mandates work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pws.byu.edu/covid-19-and-masks">This</a> information page covers studies on effectiveness of masking and of mask mandates, citing primary sources.
And finally, here's a <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818">primary source</a> examining various state mask mandates, concluding that these mandates saved lives and are an important public health consideration for future spread prevention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that <a href="https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-why-you-need-to-wear-a-face-mask-in-france-but-not-in-the-uk-137856">initial recommendations changed once we were confident that mask use made a difference</a></p>

        <p>I’m sure the sub will downvote you unfortunately but you seem civil so I’ll try and give you an answer. If you’re worried about water droplets from people who aren’t wearing masks getting inside your mouth, then why not get a face shield? Those are solid plastic and if worn properly won’t let any spit through unless they’re basically touching you.</p>
<p>Point being that instead of asking other people to change or be inconvenienced because of something you’re worried about, you can find a solution yourself that doesn’t rely on anyone but yourself.</p>
<p>If I were 90 and an ex smoker, you bet I’d be wearing an n95 and face shield every time I went in public. Not doing that is asking to get killed. As I am now, a healthy dude in college, the data shows no reason for me to be afraid of any negative side effects from catching the virus. Of course it’s possible, but to a similar degree that a deadly car accident is possible every time you get behind the wheel, or that death from alcohol poisoning is possible when I get blasted at a frat party. They’re defined risks that I have decided to take.</p>
<p>Not leaving the house and isolating myself socially would be much worse for my health than taking the tiny risk of dying from covid. I would know after doing just that for the first three months or so of this.</p>
<p>Edit: there’s no reason to downvote spam people just because they disagree with us. Nothing will ever change unless the sane and civil people in the middle ground choose our side. By all means downvote the trolls and psychotic doomers but if someone’s being civil, be civil back and try to change their mind. Don’t scare them off, that just hurts the cause and pushes them away. Express your points, support it with evidence, and show them why the bullshit we hear on the news so much is not only wrong, but harmful to many people.</p>

        <p>Excellent points. This is why I don't feel mask mandates are justified, it does not take into account individual needs and situations, and takes responsibility off the individual and forces it onto everyone without considering the consequences of that.</p>

        <p>&rt; By refusing to wear masks water droplets in your breath are put in the air </p>
<p>If you are afraid of the droplets of the 8 billion people on the planet, then YOU should take care of YOUR fear in the way that YOU best see fit!    </p>
<p>That may be a mask, a full body hazmat suit, never leaving your house, or taking an experimental injection without compensation or hope for recourse.   I really don't care how YOU choose to protect YOU.  </p>

        <p>For me, that is the risk people take by walking outside of their door each day. It is on them to understand that they’re going to get showered in germs. Just like they’ll take home skin particles of other people. For 1000s of years we breathed each other’s droplets. My humanity means I’m a germ factory. If you don’t like it - that is your concern and you are free to wear a bubble suit in public. If not, you accept the risk by placing yourself around other people. Similar to how I don’t have a choice about how the plane flying over my house could potentially crash into it and kill me. The person driving near me could kill me. Sure there are regulations on these activties, but we’re talking about breathing in public here. Will we need to regulate everything according to the most paranoid of society’s risk tolerance? No. Someone who can’t accept these risks: It’s on them to remove themself from society, or enter a mental institution where they can feel safe and get the help they need. What they can’t do is stop flights, take away cars, or tell me how to breathe. Sure a mask is a “small deal” at face value. A lot of us here believe there is much more behind the scene that is taken away. The cons outweigh the pros, which is an easy balance to tip because there are very few pros if any (see florida numbers).</p>

        <p>I struggle with a rare disorder called misophonia. It's a hatred of certain noises, which is almost always noises humans make (usually to do with eating). If I had a gun on my at time when I hear some turd chewing with his mouth open, I'd come close to or would pull the trigger on myself. I've self harmed myself and other objects, got angry at people I loved. Its really messed up my life.</p>
<p>Are you responsible? No. I do not expect the entire world to cater to me. If I go to the movie theater, I got in the middle of the week, sit in the corner, and wear headphones. During family gatherings I go hide somewhere during dinner.</p>
<p>I adapted. Its my problem. Not yours.</p>
<p>I can agree to an extend that the public should take some note of your health. Ex, if someone has the flu they should stay home. Sure. But making people wear useless masks the rest of their lives over it is very silly.</p>

        <p>In addition to the other responses, I would also add that we, as a society, have accepted the risks of infecting each other essentially forever.  The flu, to this day, still kills around half a million people per year, every year.  Yet, before now, we've never "masked up" and "maintained social distance" in an effort to protect those people.  Why not?</p>
<p>If the answer is "because COVID has killed more people", then explain to me why half a million deaths are acceptable and where the line is between 500,000 and whatever the latest COVID number is?</p>
<p>And the doomers can never provide a response to this.  They always either ignore it or resort to name calling.  Because they don't want to admit what at least I believe to be the truth: this virus was overblown by the media and got the entire world population in a global panic.  As a result, we've gone off the deep end in terms of our response.</p>

        <p>If we're all responsible for each other's health, where is the line drawn?  Just because someone who weighs 400lbs and is scarfing down McDonald's isn't an immediate danger to my health, doesn't mean there aren't ripple effects to their actions.  The long term effects to the health care system because of their actions could negatively impact someone who has spent their life living a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>There is also a certain level of personal responsibility and not forcing others kowtow to your belief system or fears.  That is why I am against the whole "my health is your responsibility" line of thinking.</p>

        <p>&rt;By refusing to wear masks water droplets in your breath are put in the air which may or may not contain the highly contagious viral disease Covid-19. Regardless of whether or not I am wearing a mask, water droplets can still get in my eyes, face, or even my own mask, and spread the disease to me.</p>
<p>The water droplets are still put in the air, with or without a mask. Unless it is an N95, it hardly does anything. Also, the virus isn't as bad as the media makes it seem. Currently, according to the coronavirus statistics on Bing, the death rate is about 2.2%, with 2,428,021 deaths and 109,859,193 cases. But in October the WHO said that about 10% of the world's population may have been infected with Covid-19. I don't have the experience or qualifications to know whether or not that number is accurate, so I will assume it is. With 1.045 million deaths on October 5 (day of the article) and 10% of the world's population on October 5th, 2020 being 779 million people, that gives us a death rate of 0.134%, and that number is including all the older and at risk people. If you have a functioning immune system and aren't way overweight you should be safe. </p>
<p>TL;DR: The coronavirus death rate is only 0.134%</p>

        <p>It kind of is if you really think about it,you may not care about them,you may actually hate them,but no matter how many times you flip the bird at the,they are still human,just like you,only reality and whatever holy being you believe it can change that fact,and saying someone dying is not your problem just proves you actually are a total piece of shit. Like say you had Corona and started coughing up phlegm on random people or their food,and one of them actually dies,they're family members will of course blame it on you,then imagine your in that situation,how will you feel? Of course you'll blame it on the person who did that.</p>

        <p>Yes,there was no coordinated world-wide lockdown,most were put into lockdowns,the reason some countries didn't go into lockdown is because their leaders were responsible enough to lock the country away from the outside world like Taiwan,or had beaten the virus because of the said lockdown,like South Korea and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Just imagine it,your thinking the best case scenario where everyone locks their country from the world and China manages to contain the virus,think of our current situation and the worst case scenario too,like they say,"hope for the best,prepare for the worst.".</p>

<p>I'm talking about government-mandated lockdowns, which South Korea <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/26/821688981/how-south-korea-reigned-in-the-outbreak-without-shutting-everything-down">didn't</a> have. </p>
<p>Florida <em>is</em> the worst-case scenario, at least as far as the US is concerned: we didn't lock down at all, <em>and</em> we have a higher proportion of older people than most (if not all) states. If lockdowns help, then we should have been <em>fucked</em>. But we're fine.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry that I misunderstood - Voluntary testing/measures are fine, and businesses can enact whatever policies they like.</p>
<p>But my argument is that, in the US, the government lockdowns didn't make anybody safer. However, I can't say the same for other countries.</p>

        <p>The lockdown is not great,I personally don’t like it either actually,I miss fooling around with my buddies back then,now we can only text via messenger and Discord,play CODM and WOTB and just hope everything will be fine,but I’d rather have a harder time in Chinese class then be sick as the best case scenario or getting severe pneumonia worst case. So please,I beg of you to see it from different points of views,I’ve tried looking how you see this dumpster fire of a year and soon the next one,and I understand,I never liked the Lockdown like earlier,and please look at those people who have lost loved ones to the virus.</p>

        <p>So do you mean we all must take responsibility to a degree? Because I agree with that. If you're ill, stay home. If you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose and don't do it on other people. Stuff like that is both reasonable and conditional. My problem with this is that people are saying that it's my fault that a stranger died because I might have had covid and not known. Is that fair? No. Sure, don't go visit granny if you have a bad cough, it's your responsibility there. But if you're perfectly fine and you go visit granny and she gets ill, it's not your fault. These are the risks we must take as a part of life, and individuals shouldn't have to carry the burden that they exist. This whole idea that unintentionally spreading a disease as humans always have done is equivalent to killing someone is very harmful and it needs to stop.</p>

        <p>"if it protects the people around them, how does it not also protect them?" the answer to this is very simple - basically all masks prevent you from spreading your breath but don't protect you from the air you breathe in. Only the most expensive ones (i.e N95) protect you from the air you breathe in by filtering it meanwhile stupidly cheap masks protect everyone else from your breath.</p>
<p>The vast majority of masks protects others but not yourself, hence the "it's not to protect me, it's to protect you",</p>

        <p>Not just 'very poor evidence'... NO evidence that generalized mask usage controls the spread of a respiratory virus.</p>
<p>Even when worn by those who are KNOWN infectious, the best research on the subject done over 50 years shows no benefit or very little benefit.</p>

        <p>This is why I suggest they wear N95s since they're easy to purchase now. I was met with "they're too expensive" and "they're too hard to put on". If they're so afraid of covid why is something &lt;$1 that's harder to put on so terrible. If I were hell bent on safety I'd much rather do that than try to police the world.</p>

<p>Person unknowingly has covid and wears a mask the covid particles they breathe out are trapped in the mask so cant spread to other people. This stops the spread. </p>
<p>Person unknowingly has covid doesnt wear a mask so nothing to trap the covid particles so spreads out in the air everywhere and lands on other peoples clothes faces and eyes and on the surfaces people touch. Even if the other person is wearing a mask they arent safe as particles can enter the eyes. Or they touch surfaces no infected with covid particles which then go on their hands and they rub their eyes/mouth with hands covered in covid particles.</p>
<p>Its a piece of cloth covering your mouth and nose its not difficult to do.</p>

        <p>&rt; Person unknowingly has covid and wears a mask the covid particles they breathe out are trapped in the mask</p>
<p>I'd like proof for this statement. </p>
<p>I'd also like to know how long each type of mask being worn by the public effectively filters the virus, since people aren't changing their face coverings regularly. When moisture from breathing builds up inside the mask, does that inhibit the mask's filtering capability? If there are sizable gaps on the sides of the mask, how effective of a filter is it?</p>

        <p>Because the protection a mask offers is mostly for other people, not themselves. So if the other person wears a mask, but you don’t, YOU are a lot safer than THEY are. It’s really easy to see why too, just go outside and breath out without a mask vs. with a mask. The water vapor you see when you exhale is pretty much exactly what a mask attempts to limit. By redirecting and catching that vapor, it helps reduce the viral load another person can receive.</p>

        <p>Given that AIDS was largely an issue with promiscuous gay men, and has a vastly smaller chance of being spread via heterosexual intercourse, I don't think he was likely a problem.</p>
<p>And if you happen to be a promiscuous gay man, that's on you for not being sexually selective.</p>
<p>Not once were people forced to walk around with condoms on "just in case" during the 80s AIDS epidemic.</p>

        <p>Because the one that actually does, an N95 mask, has to be fit tested to each person’s face, and are more expensive and difficult to come by. I for one actually have a gas mask that does the same job, but I’ll be damned if I need to lug that thing around just because of anti maskers like you.</p>

        <p>That has to be the most blisteringly stupid take I’ve ever heard. I’m glad people like you are rare enough that I don’t HAVE to wear a gas mask to go to the grocery store. Because I HAVE done that back when this whole thing started and people weren’t catching on.</p>
<p>&rt;But only if I have to put in the effort</p>
<p>First off, you literally aren’t putting in the effort to protect the people around you if you don’t wear a mask, which is incredibly selfish. And I am putting in the effort, <em>by wearing a mask, sanitizing the surfaces I touch, and social distancing.</em> It’s really amazing these days how easy it is to find the selfish people these days, just look for the anti maskers.</p>

        <p>It is not in the least bit unreasonable to expect the general public to keep you safe. There is a reason why we all drive in our lanes on the road, it keeps not only us but those around us safe. The expectation when driving is that others will stay in their lane, and signal when changing lanes. By your reasoning that it is "irrational to expect the general public to keep you safe", then it is okay if somebody cuts you off without signaling in traffic because it is not their responsibility to safely change lanes, but yours to avoid them.</p>
<p>We live in a society where our interactions have direct consequences and impact on those around us. Guns are another example. Why would it be unreasonable to expect a gun owner to keep his gun holstered, safety on, and pointed away from others? If it isn't their responsibility to keep you safe from their gun, then they are more than entitled to point their loaded guns at you. After all, it would be your responsibility to stay safe from them.</p>
<p>Or conversely, if you were a gun owner and it wasn't your responsibility to keep someone else safe, then its total reasonable for you to go out into public and point a loaded gun at whomever you may please.</p>

<p>Of course not everybody is virulent because not everybody has covid. But anybody can become a vector for it and unfortunately with uncontrolled spread, a large percentage would become infected due to the R0 and exponential spread pattern of the virus.</p>

        <p>Why exactly does my analogy not fit?</p>
<p>It isn't feasible to fit everyone with N95's or masks, nor is it practical. Even now doctors and nurses are having to reuse N95's, the supply simply isn't there. If we truly wanted to increase supply to that point, we could but it take a very long time to do so. The amount of materials that wastes also just isn't justifiable when the alternative of double layers disposable or cloth masks can achieve the same effect through widespread usage.</p>
<p>I do double mask and have worn a face shield as I am in close contact with a high number of individuals daily at work.</p>
<p>It isn't about control, it is about creating an environment that inhibits the spread of covid while allowing everyone to be able to go to work, go out and eat, and enjoy their lives. The alternative is lockdowns or having those who are obese or have an underlying condition (which is over 50% of the US) to stay at home. Just isn't sustainable economically or healthy to have so many people locked up for so long as many on NNN have said many times.</p>
<p>Not using masks undeniably results in widespread infection and a very high number of deaths. I would be glad to look at any data or studies which prove that masks don't work.</p>

        <p>Naw, no need for a gas mask. Mask adherence is an issue that we only have with children in this area. So measures such as a gas mask or N95’s are overkill, especially when hospitals across the nation are having to reuse their N95’s multiple times after sterilization. Common consensus among the medical and scientific field is that masks work, and work even more effectively when there is a high adherence and proper usage. You still have yet to present any evidence on your viewpoint to prove the contrary.</p>

<p>Yes, I gathered that's where you derive most of your viewpoints. Consensus Opinion. </p>
<p>Problem is, cloth does very little to prevent the transmission of airborne viruses, cloth masks actually may do more harm than good(they create a warm moist bacteria producing environment, as well as a false sense of security). If you're truly worried about catching covid, purchase one of the masks I referenced earlier. That would 100% keep you safe. Then it doesn't matter what anyone else is wearing.</p>

        <p>Common consensus of doctors and scientists, not the general public. Additionally, I would love to see the study or data which you base this claim upon:</p>
<p>&rt;Problem is, cloth does very little to prevent the transmission of airborne viruses, cloth masks actually may do more harm than good(they create a warm moist bacteria producing environment, as well as a false sense of security)</p>
<p>I do not need to purchase one of those masks. There is high mask adherence in the community in which I reside. That eliminates the need for safety measures which provides a reduction in transmission for the wearer. In other words, source control is effective and implemented well enough that I do not need a gas mask. Two, many healthcare workers still do not have access to a steady supply of N95's as they should. I would rather not add to that strain by selfishly purchasing those same filters for respirators, especially in a situation where it is not necessary.</p>
<p>Here is a study which speaks towards the warm moist bacteria producing environment that you are talking about:</p>

        <p>No need for you to wear a gas mask? Really? Why not? If your face is so endangered by people not wearing masks, are you unwilling to protect it? Is that because you don't take Corona seriously, and you just want to feel superior in virtue to others? </p>

        <p>Your analogy does not fit. It would fit, if your car was wearing a cape of invincibility, and was impervious to damage. Then it would not matter what lane I drive my car in. </p>
<p>You must not have looked at the mask I referenced. It is not a wussy N95 mask, it is a full on respirator with eye protection and organic filters. If the 10% or so of the public who is worried about covid-19 wore such masks, they would not have to worry at all what other people are or are not wearing. </p>
<p>By typical politically-correct standards, you should be wearing such a mask. "If it lowers the risk of transmission just a little, why wouldn't you wear it?"</p>
<p>Well, this drops your risk to ZERO. </p>
<p>Why wouldn't you wear such a mask? </p>
<p>Do you not believe in science?</p>
<p>Do you want people to die?</p>
<p>Are you selfish?</p>
<p>The answer of course, is you want to continue to tell other people what to do, and if vulnerable(or paranoid) people wore these masks, you would no longer be able to micromanage other individuals in society.</p>

        <p>The point of my comment was to highlight the similarities in principle behind following norms set by society, such as wearing a mask or driving on the right side of the road.</p>
<p>Many have made the argument, "how is the health of others my responsibility?" It isn't, your responsibility is to act in a manner which is not injurious to others lives or health as a member of society. </p>
<p>If someone chooses to make poor decisions or has a poor diet, then that is on them. That choice affect them, and primarily just their health adversely. But you choosing not to wear a mask can affect the health of those in your proximity.</p>
<p>With asymptomatic infections, the severity of symptoms being so mild for some that they do not believe it is covid, and the incubation time for covid you could very well be a vector without knowing it. Wearing a mask is a sign of respect as a citizen in a society to those around you.</p>
<p>Even if it isn't something that will affect you or those directly around you adversely, the community spread resulting from you choosing not to wear a mask can very well lead to the death of someone separated form you by a few degrees.</p>
<p>I do see that the disconnect here is your belief that not wearing a mask is not dangerous. I would be glad to discuss the efficacy of masks if you would so chose to engage in a debate about them. I would love to see some evidence for your claim that masks are essentially unnecessary.</p>

        <p>Consider thinking for your self for once.  </p>
<p>Asymptomatic = not enough virus particles to bring forth an immune response, hence no symptoms, therefore, not even enough virus particles to spread around.  </p>
<p>A key player in the higher 'positive' rates come from the use of PCR tests as a testing mechanism, which has a 3% false positivity rate.  </p>

        <p>The top health experts in the world stated they were not effective for the first three months of the pandemic, then overnight... So I’m supposed to believe a group of people who passed medical school and with decades of experience were wrong for 3 months about something as trivial as effectiveness of a cloth over your mouth? Nah, there is something else at play here. Possibly government just trying to throw a placebo at the problem to make it look like they’re doing something. All that aside, we see the state of Florida and other countries without masks for a good amount of time, and with more gatherings, and those places aren’t looking all that bad at all. That should be all the proof anyone needs right there.</p>

        <p>Anecdotally, many thought that the world was the center of the universe. Or that the world was flat. The scientific process is quite peculiar in the sense that the null hypothesis remains the standing conclusive result of an experiment unless a statistically significant body of data proves the alternate.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of gray area with what occurred with masks and I myself do not agree with how it was handled either. Regardless of what happened and putting all politics, intents, possible lies aside, the studies overwhelmingly support  the efficacy of mask usage, lockdowns, etc.</p>
<p>Would you happen to have any data or studies which support the claim that mask usage is not necessary, does not work, etc.?</p>

        <p>If the story is that in 2020 our best health professionals were wrong about something as trivial as a mask preventing virus spread through droplets for 3 months, then that alone is more troubling than the so called conspiracy reasons for their flip-flop.</p>
<p>The proof is obvious that they’re not effective and lock-downs don’t work. Like I said, take a look at the charts posted all over this sub. Florida and places with relaxed or no mask mandates are doing relatively good, when they were expected to be scenes from 28 days later. Sweden has deemed masks unecessary / not effective. There is no proof that they work. The hypothesis was never that they did work, until the politically charged narrative arrived to say they work because of the reason: “we said so”. Placing the burden of proof on any opposing viewpoints. Even though there is overwhelming proof, it will never be enough for them anyway, because reason is not driving this.</p>

        <p>So theres a few issues which I would like to address from your comment. The are two narratives in 2020. The first is the official narrative according to many news outlets. They state that the reason why masks weren’t required at first was due to the fact that scientists did not believe that there was enough community spread, or cause for concern to warrant them. </p>
<p>Now i’m a bit skeptical and I believe that the reason why masks were required at first but were not recommended was to allow time for hospitals to get some more masks before there was a mad run for them in March. We still saw that mad run even before masks were recommended and even now some hospitals do not have a steady supply of N95’s.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have yet to see credible proof that masks do not work. Credible meaning a study or peer reviewed publishing.</p>
<p>I have seen those graphs posted on this page and they are very much misleading. If you would be kind enough to link one of those graphs then I can show you why they are misleading. </p>
<p>Additionally, there is a plethora of studies which prove that masks work. I can link some in the near future as I get a chance to.</p>

        <p>So people actually accept that they lied to the public and put their health at risk to conserve pieces of cloth. But it was for the best, they must be telling the truth now. They’re done with lying. Why would they lie again?... Sounds like an abusive relationship to me.

<p>Heres one that I only had to scroll down a bit for. What kind of mental acrobatics need to be done to suggest this doesn’t show a coorelation? Masks, no masks, same result, and most importantly people are not social distancing - same results, suggesting lockdowns don’t work. There are similar charts showing numbers for US states like Florida if you scroll down enough. If you’re waiting for the corporate owned media to tell you the sky is not falling, or a politically influenced “science” article to be published refuting the narrative, you’ll be waiting a long time. Meanwhile you could stick your head outside and see that it’s not falling yourself. People don’t need to be told how to act and what to think. If there was a real problem out of control in places like Florida, do you think most people wouldn’t be taking it seriously? Nobody would need to be told how bad things are.</p>

        <p>Driving on the side of the road mandated by law is not a "norm"</p>
<p>Furthermore, precedent says that we are not responsible to prevent the passage of viruses in day to day life, precedent is even stronger when it comes to coronaviruses.  The norm is to just go on with your life if you have a coronavirus.</p>
<p>My evidence that masks are unnecessary is the following.  We have prospered on this planet for tens of thousands of years without masks, and will continue to do so when our species adapts to this virus, so long as we are allowed to adapt to it, but people like you seem hell bent on preventing that and ensuring that our species at large remains susceptible to it.</p>

        <p>It seems that you may have missed the point which I was attempting to illustrate. It was not meant to be a direct analogy, but a sort of comparison for why phrases such as "it isn't reasonable to expect others to keep me safe" are inept at disproving the need for masks. </p>
<p>In essence, I was trying to say that it is an expectation as a member of society that you act in a way which is not injurious to others. It's the reason why we have laws regarding travel on a motorway. It's why there are punishments for violating laws or committing crimes. And it is why masks have become a norm and are expected to be worn in social settings.</p>

        <p>Except that mask wearing is NOT the norm and has never been recommended before c19. Even through past deadly flu seasons. Even though c19 spreads the same way as the flu. Government health officials are trying desperately to normalize it now while not addressing the fact that they have never been recommended in the past and without solid evidence of their effectiveness. Same goes for lockdowns.
Public health policies that depend on coercion and shaming are not science - they're dogma.</p>

        <p>Mask wearing is very much a norm dependent upon the community you live in. Take Japan, China, and many other Eastern Countries. Take Australia, and New Zealand for more recent examples. And take a look and mask adherence for cities across the US such as New York, Seattle, LA, etc.</p>

        <p>There are many. Have you tried looking? Have you ever wondered why mainstream media makes is verboten to even ask questions about the effectiveness of masks and lockdowns? What is this new science where there is no reviewing and no discussion? Why censor voices (I am speaking of qualified data scientists, immunologist and physicians) and paint their findings as "dangerous" to public health?</p>
<p>The largest RCT masks study done:</p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</p>
<p>Here is a recent one that concluded while infection prevention is stronger in clinical settings than community settings, the applicability to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain:</p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-3213</p>
<p>Of course both the CDC and WHO did not recommend them prior to April 2020:</p>
<p>https://time.com/5794729/coronavirus-face-masks/</p>
<p>Which is surprising because if the masks are as effective as they now claim in combating respiratory illness, why only now to they issue guidance in using them?</p>
<p>To your point on the cultural norms of mask wearing in Eastern countries - it is my understanding that a large amount of mask wearing in places like China is due to poor air quality.  As for more recent adoption of masks in Australia and New Zealand, despite their (draconian in my opinion) efforts to mitigate the virus, the entire thing falls apart as soon as people begin living their lives as normal. With cases appearing shortly after the loosening of lockdown measures. It's a hopeless cycle.</p>
<p>Americans are actually very compliant in their mask wearing. Especially in places like the cities you stated above. Yet cases <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuXXAhEVkAIGgGc?format=jpg&amp;name=large">exploded</a> regardless.</p>
<p>Why are flu cases so low this year? Why are deaths from heart attacks, cancer and other advanced diseases so low? Why is it that the lower number of expected yearly deaths are almost in exact portions to the excess c19 deaths?</p>
<p>Thank you for being civil and asking questions. I'm glad conversations like this can still happen.</p>

        <h1>Study/link 1that you posted</h1>
<p>I'm going to make a few points here using verbatim excerpts from the first study you just linked. Points 1 and 2 are fairly good summarizations of the study as the excerpts come directly from the discussion section. The rest of the points just provide supporting info.</p>
<p><strong>Point 1.</strong></p>
<p>"The findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the study period, authorities did not recommend face mask use outside hospital settings and mask use was rare in community settings (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817#r22-M206817">22</a>). This means that study participants' exposure was overwhelmingly to persons not wearing masks.</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>This is from the discussion section. As we know, in order for masks to be effective, there has to be wide spread use of them. Hence, the mask mandates. The study does talk briefly about the use of masks as a method of prevention of spread but was not not the main focus of this study. There are plenty of studies which talk about the effectiveness of mask mandates in preventing transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Point 2</strong></p>
<p>"Our results suggest that the recommendation to wear a surgical mask when outside the home among others did not reduce, at conventional levels of statistical significance, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mask wearers in a setting where social distancing and other public health measures were in effect, mask recommendations were not among those measures, and community use of masks was uncommon. Yet, the findings were inconclusive and cannot definitively exclude a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection of mask wearers in such a setting. It is important to emphasize that this trial did not address the effects of masks as source control or as protection in settings where social distancing and other public health measures are not in effect."</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>This again was from the discussion section and reiterates the main points of the study. All this study proves is that mask wearing may not work in a setting where those around you aren't wearing a mask. The studies results were also inconclusive so there is not really any information which is actionable from the results of the study.</p>
<p><strong>Point 3</strong></p>
<p>"Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection."</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>This is from the results section of the study which you posted. It shows that masking up will not protect just mask wearer if others around them don't wear a mask. It also states the results were not statistically significant.</p>
<p><strong>Point 4</strong></p>
<p>"Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others."</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>The above except is from the limitations section of the paper. The results of this test were inconclusive. The p value between the two groups was a .38. Here is a link which talks about the importance of a p value and confidence intervals when determining whether a study has evidence which is statistically significant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689604/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689604/</a></p>
<p>I recommend reading the first three blurbs as the rest of it is confusing without reading the three other parts of the study. But by all means feel free to read all parts if you do so feel inclined</p>
<p><strong>Point 5</strong></p>
<p>"Although we saw no statistically significant difference in presence of other respiratory viruses, the study was not sufficiently powered to draw definite conclusions about the protective effect of masks for other viral infections. Likewise, the study had limited power for any of the subgroup analyses"</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>This is again from the discussion section of the study and talks about how this study can not really be used to determine whether or not a mask helps with other viral infections because that was not accounted for in the design of this study.</p>

        <h1>Study 2/link 2</h1>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that this study was completed in April 2020 during the early months of the pandemic so the questions that are asked in this study have been more thoroughly answered and tested in other studies.</p>
<p>These quotes will be verbatim from the study and will include the context of the quote by including the full body of text around it to a degree that is reasonable. Feel free to compare the quotes I have used to the text itself if you do not believe that I am not accurately transcribing the quotes.</p>
<p>So lets look at what the point of this study was. This was the purpose section of the study so we can be on the same page about what this study was looking for.</p>
<p>&rt;To examine the effectiveness of N95, surgical, and cloth masks in community and health care settings for preventing respiratory virus infections, and effects of reuse or extended use of N95 masks.</p>
<p>Here is the conclusion section of the study.</p>
<p>&rt;Evidence on mask effectiveness for respiratory infection prevention is stronger in health care than community settings. N95 respirators might reduce SARS-CoV-1 risk versus surgical masks in health care settings, but applicability to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain.</p>
<p>This study does not discredit the use of masks as a means of source control. The conclusion section is talking about the use of masks as a way to prevent the wearer from being infected by patients that they are directly working with.</p>
<p>The study further elaborates on this in the discussion section.</p>
<p>This is from the discussion section: </p>
<p>&rt;The review process had limitations. In particular, we used streamlined rapid review methods for searching and selecting studies. We did not perform critical appraisal of observational studies by using a formal instrument, though key methodological limitations were highlighted. We included 1 non–peer-reviewed study (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-3213#r21-M203213">21</a>), which could reduce data quality. Meta-analysis was not attempted owing to study limitations and heterogeneity in study designs, comparisons, and analyses.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Research is urgently needed to clarify the comparative effectiveness of masks for transmission of COVID-19 in community and health care settings; randomized trials are in progress (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-3213#r64-M203213">64</a>, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-3213#r65-M203213">65</a>). Observational studies that prospectively measure mask use, other infection prevention and control measures (accounting for potential correlations), and exposures could supplement randomized trials. Given limitations in the supply of N95 respirators, understanding the effects of reuse or extended use of N95 respirators is a priority (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-3213#r66-M203213">66</a>).<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In conclusion, evidence on the effectiveness of masks for prevention of respiratory infection is stronger in health care than community settings. Use of N95 respirators might reduce SARS-CoV-1 risk versus surgical masks in health care settings, but applicability to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain.</p>
<p>This study simply is saying that at the time, the data is not there to justify a strong enough conclusion that mask wearing prevents the wearer from becoming infected. I can get more in depth into this study but will not simply for the essence of time as I do have your other points to address and other responsibilities to manage.</p>

<p>The previous link itself had a blurb about how that study would be used as a possible source of information for implementation of guidelines. The study and this article are very close in date and are early in the pandemic. All three of these studies/article are, for lack of a better word, dated. There have been numerous other studies which have since provided more information on the matter.</p>
<p>&rt;the entire thing falls apart as soon as people begin living their lives as normal. With cases appearing shortly after the loosening of lockdown measures. It's a hopeless cycle.</p>
<p>It is a cycle but certainly not hopeless. Here is a book which you may find useful. It highlights different methods of spread prevention and provide evidence for a very balanced response between the extremes of opening up/no masks and locking down completely.</p>
<p>&rt;Americans are actually very compliant in their mask wearing. Especially in places like the cities you stated above. Yet cases <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuXXAhEVkAIGgGc?format=jpg&amp;name=large">exploded</a> regardless.</p>
<p>I have not looked at these polls yet but I have seen many graphs like this and they often time they do not offer a complete picture or are quite misleading. I will have to look into the graph itself, but at the moment there is about a 1/3 of the US states which do not have a mask mandate in place or enforcement of measures. This graph only provides the title of polls itself (for all that I currently know could have been localized polls), yet provides data for the entirety of the US. We can not reasonably assume that this explosion of cases does not mean that masks do not work because this graph hasn't differentiated between cases in areas with mask mandates, vs areas without mask mandates. Needs a bit more information before we can conclusively say what this graphs implications are.</p>
<p>Here is a very recent study with numbers on mask adherence across the US. But please do note that it is a pre-print at the moment. There are other studies out there too. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.21250029v2.full-text">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.21250029v2.full-text</a></p>
<p>Additionally, covid can still spread in areas where mask mandates are in place because of people visiting each others homes, or seeing each other without masks, among many other variables. </p>
<p>&rt;Why are flu cases so low this year? Why are deaths from heart attacks, cancer and other advanced diseases so low? Why is it that the lower number of expected yearly deaths are almost in exact portions to the excess c19 deaths?</p>
<p>Flu cases are low this year because of masks. Heart attack and cancer death I dont know, I need to look into it again because I do not remember the exact reason at this moment. I have looked at it recently so perhaps I'll try following that rabbit hole again. The third question, I am not sure exactly what you mean by this question. Is there a data set which you could reference please?</p>

        <p>So you really think flu cases are down due to mask wearing but c19 is up due to not enough mask wearing? So two masks then? Surely that will work.</p>
<p>I appreciate you going through the studies.</p>
<p>I hope the mass psychosis ends soon. I for one will not be a collaborator. I will not and have not worn a mask nor will I live my life as if I and every healthy person around me is a carrier of infection.</p>

        <p>&rt; And it is why masks have become a norm and are expected to be worn in social settings.</p>
<p>This happened because the media convinced you to be terrified of the flu.  Also it is not the social normal in all places because in some places, people are not terrified of the flu.</p>

        <p>exactly. ive been working out daily for over a decade now. these actions have put me at less risk of catching covid, and less risk of spreading it. </p>
<p>statistically most people have not been taking care of their own health to any serious degree for the last 50 years. i think we would benefit a lot more from eating less, moving more and taking vitamins, but ive seen no such emphasis since the pandemic started</p>

        <p>A Reddit moment? On Reddit? Wow how strange?!
I have backed up what I've said (with as much poise and detail as I've been show)... to other people. I give responses befitting whom I'm talk to. You act like a clown, I set up the bigtop. If you're unsatisfied with my responses, look inward to how you act. But let's be honest, regardless of what I said, you'd still be hostile, because people like you have no personality besides being hostile to strangers on the internet. That's it. That's your whole life.</p>
<p>But alright, this has been super fun, but it's time for me to work. Contributing positively to society is fun, you should try it sometime. Watching you flail has really gotten me through all these zoom meetings this morning, but I'm done with you, and this whole pathetic daycare you call a subreddit, for that matter. It's truly disgusting how ignorant and selfish each and one of every one of you really is. I hope you can find the help you need. If you feel the need to reply, please know that it's essentially screaming into the void, as I will not sully my eyes with your idiocy any longer. Please get help.</p>

        <p>You mean New Zealand which is an island nation which closed its borders and which will have to have them closed (or with extreme quarantines) for the rest of human existence if their goal is zero covid? And then immediately lock down for a single case?</p>
<p>The common factor between places that "controlled" covid is closed borders. Masks/lockdowns only have negative effects</p>

        <p>I’m certainly not confused. do you know what the largest risk factor is for dying of covid? its being overweight. guess who spreads disease the most? those who cannot fight it off quickly, largely overweight people. </p>
<p>the majority of the US is overweight and hasnt been doing shit about it for years. ive been working out daily. now all the sudden its more important that i prioritize their health, and theyre still not prioritizing it themselves? foh</p>

        <p>No one is saying you should, but that's the beauty of the simple act of wearing a fucking mask: it helps everyone, including yourself to not get covid in the first place. And if you think that you can only care about one issue, then perhaps you're more confused than I previously thought</p>

<p>Are we trying to save lives? Because it seems to me screaming at smokers would be more beneficial than trying to shame a few people trying to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>This is a good point.  Many people weren't aware of how many people die everyday.  If the news reported on how many people die from preventable heart disease every day, they could get people to panic easily.  </p>
<p>Perception is often reality to many people and the news creates a perception of reality that isn't true.</p>

        <p>People have managed to be tricked into thinking if they dont care about every person that dies, then they are selfish, and thats just not the case. </p>
<p>Its not unselfish to not care when people die. Sounds harsh, but its true. </p>
<p>Over 50,000,000 million people die a year. There are 31, 536,000 seconds in a year. </p>
<p>Even if we dedicated a second to every person that died, we couldnt mourn them all. And if we tried, we wouldnt have time for anything else.</p>

        <p>At the beginning...I was told by a couple of gas station attendants to not return without a mask...so I just found a gas station that didn’t give a shit!! Middle Eastern men own it...they’re cool af!! They’ve been getting my business for almost a year...even though I go a mile out of the way!! My local grocery store is a large chain &amp; 98% are wearing masks...yet I want in free breathing &amp; no one says a word to me!! The only time I wear one...is walking in/out of restaurants because some Karen could get them shut down</p>

        <p>I got banned from a Facebook group when the subject :pandemic and anything related to it was discussed and I said what I believed about it (it didn't aligned with the government views on it) and I immediately got banned from the group. For speaking freely.
I come from an ex comunista country and I recognise comunism and we are heading towards it so fast and we are actually living a lie with thinking it's democracy. Be careful what you say and to whom nowadays. We are living bizzare times and going backwards.
Instead of learning from history we are trying to erase it and build our society on lies...its a lot to be said here.</p>

        <p>As someone whose 'delved' into history a bit I saw this shit before the first lockdown even happened, I didn't expect the masses to give in as easily as they did though and its frightening to know how much cowardice runs through western society.

Noone truly cares about their neighbors anyway especially here in the states. These people that belittle you for not wanting to wear a mask(muzzle) are just trying to make themselves feel better/wanting to feel validated online.</p>

        <p>Same people want some kind of universal healthcare.... where healthy athletic young people like myself with no pre-existing conditions who only use the system for routine stuff or maybe orthopaedic sugery for a freak injury ends up subsidizing the wheelchair bound diabetic/alcoholic/smoker boomer who is taking an ambo to the ER every few weeks and is on disability who never cared about themselves. Insurance companies as grimey as they are would atleast classify the risk and use in order to charge accordingly - government is not allowed to do that.</p>

        <p>I take responsibility for my health. I'll wear masks where required because a business might make me do so for entry. Otherwise, no. I'm around friends, family and even acquaintances where none of us wear masks and any kind of social distancing is random. I suppose it's an Miracle from God as to who we all remain healthy. Then again, the odds are greatly in our favor in not having it. Or, alternately, we all just happen to have shown no symptoms.</p>
<p>I make decisions, they make decisions, often enough I'll stand in line at supermarkets or other businesses where people don't care how close they are to one another. It must be a terrible shock that my area isn't overrun with COVID deaths.</p>
<p>The other thing is the misleading information from the media. They mostly track cases rising, but we're not seeing a similar percentage growth of deaths.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind these are severely depressed individuals who feel a sense of satisfaction from wearing and mask and telling others to do so. They’ve never donated to a cause or offered their time to help people in need. They wear a mask because it takes zero effort and yet allows them to think they’re being selfless.</p>

        <p>Why should my husband or I put our autistic son at risk of a meltdown and panic attack which can trigger an asthma attack for the sake of other people's health? (When communicating he likes to see people's mouth move so he has something to focus on instead of making eye contact.) I have a medical exemption too but I will never wear a mask especially around my son for that reason. </p>

        <p>Thing is, your son breaks their worldview.</p>
<p>What they care about IS the most important thing.</p>
<p>Oh, they will tell you that they're being kind, in that tone that suggests that if you don't, then you aren't.</p>
<p>But it's because for all the "empathy" they espouse and that they claim to have, they don't have a speck of it for anyone who doesn't fall in line with what they think the important thing is - which quite conveniently what lines up with the thing that they want.</p>
<p>Never mind your general state of being going into deterioration because your son degrades into a less than optimal state because masks have more <em>bad effect</em> than <em>good effect</em>.</p>
<p>Anything that breaks the idea that the mask is good and only good and any "badness" is imagined and any protest is the sign of a bad person basically whinging about having to do the "right" thing.</p>
<p>They won't even entertain the idea that you might have a reason other than "selfish" or "Trump supporter" or "anti-science".</p>
<p>So much for "empathy", eh?</p>

<p>It might not be your responsibility, but it is your duty to try your hardest to keep people safe. Even if masks don't work, I would love to know, why would you not wear them? It's not really a huge impact on your life. I'm not trying to shit on the sub or tell you people that you are explicitly wrong or anything, I just want to know why the government would want to force you to wear a mask. It's not part of some secret plan to track you with microchips or steal your identity, so I don't get why people make them such a big deal. Again, not looking to hate, but just curious as to why wearing a mask is bad. Even if it does nothing, what does the government gain? </p>
<p>P.S. Because of stereotypes associated with anti-maskers, I feel the need to say that if you decide to lose your shit on me or downvote me to Oblivion just for asking a question, it only proves and enforces this stereotype. I am honestly curious as to why wearing a mask is bad, so I am just looking for a civil conversion/debate about the topic. Being an asshole because someone asked/challenged your opinion only proves your own insecurity. I assume we can be respectable and mature and not act like apes. So, in conclusion, please try to be nice and keep the conversation/debate civil and under control.</p>
<p>Thank you, 
Me</p>

<p>I assume you are referring to the government and not the person himself, because I highly doubt he is involved in the covid administrative matters. </p>
<p>The frustration regarding lockdown is understandable. Lockdowns come at a high economic and social cost. The aim is to reduce the number of infected, which is a compounding number, thus the earlier and stricter, the better. However, governments often only focus on the latter aspect, and even so impose shitty lockdowns that are not much worse from having no lockdowns at all.(compounding effect). Thus, you should not blame lockdown itself , but rather the scope and effectiveness of it. A strict and efficient lockdown which will quickly reduce cases can be done in less than two weeks to a month, along with lots of contact tracing. Certainty, tangible losses must be taken into account. A trade off must be established, such that a good balance can be struck in between the two. (HK is a good example of this, the infection waves correspond to each time guard of covid is let down). IMO, contact tracing and quarantine is the most effective and least damaging way(in fact, you can prevent spikes just by doing this) , but lockdowns should and must be implemented when the need arises.</p>

        <p>Yeah because people ignoring all that shit for the holidays didn't create a massive spike in infections and deaths, which tapered back off as states locked down again. We could have had this issue finished if the government had taken care of it's people so they could quarantine for a month. But they didn't and a bunch of people decided they were more afraid of wearing a piece of cloth on their face than of getting and spreading disease. Otherwise wle'd be back and up and running by now.</p>

        <p>I am sure that insulting people will for sure convince them. If your goal is really to get people to see your side and improve the world, then you would not be taking that route.  However if your goal is to be self righteous and condescending in order to boost your own ego, then your behavior makes perfect sense.</p>

        <p>If you cared about your cause, then you'd present yourself in a way that might change opinions but since just come in just to insult everyone, that makes it clear you only care about yourself.  You don't want to admit that to yourself though, the truth hurts, so you keep trying to use covid as an excuse.  People see through it immediately though because rude behavior only hurts your supposed cause and drives people further away.</p>

        <p>Dr. Rodger Hodkinson is one of many, but probably the most decorated, experienced and well educated. </p>
<p><em>It should be thought of as nothing other than a bad flu season," said Hodkinson. "This is not ebola. It's not SARS.</em>"</p>
<p><em>The reaction to the coronavirus is "politics playing medicine, and that's a very dangerous game."</em></p>
<p>"<em>There is no action of any kind needed other than what happened last year when we got unwell," he said. "We stayed home, we took chicken noodle soup, we didn’t visit granny, and we decided when we would return to work. We didn’t need anyone to tell us."</em></p>
<p><em>White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, in fact, co-authored an article published March 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine predicting the case fatality rate for COVID-19 would turn out to be like that of a "severe seasonal influenza," about one-tenth of 1%. The Centers for Disease Control now estimates the survival rate for those infected with COVID-19 is 99.997% for ages 0-19; 99.98% for 20-49; 99.5% for 50-69; and 94.6% for those 70 and older. The World Health Organization's estimate in March of a death rate of 3.4% sparked panic worldwide, fueling the catastrophic lockdowns.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hodkinson said masks "are utterly useless."</strong></p>
<p><strong>"There is no evidence base for their effectiveness, whatsoever," he said. "Paper masks and fabric masks are simply virtue signaling."</strong></p>
<p><em>Masks are not worn correctly most of the time, the physician said.</em></p>
<p>"<em>It's utterly ridiculous, seeing these uneducated people -- I'm not saying that in a pejorative sense -- seeing these walking around like lemmings obeying with any knowledge base to put the mask on their face," he said</em>.</p>
<p><em>He said "social distancing" is also useless because COVID-19 spread by aerosol, which travels some 30 yards before landing.</em></p>
<p><em>A randomized, controlled Danish study published this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that a "recommendation to wear a surgical mask when outside the home among others did not reduce, at conventional levels of statistical significance, incident [COVID-19] infection compared with no mask recommendation."</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/full-transcript-doctor-destroys-utterly-unfounded-public-hysteria-over-covid">Dr. Hodkinson's full transcript can be read here.</a></p>

        <p>Yes but you are going around thinking people not wearing masks are killing others, and this virus is mad contagious like you're gonna be hospitalised instantly.</p>
<p>Fucking hell asymptomatic spread doesn't happen, that was probably the lie to explain the huge false positive rate. The average person who gets this gets the sniffles and maybe a fever for a few days and then back to normal. The hospitalizations are worst case scenario and are most likely related to your already poor health. This is the example the mainstream media shows you all the time.</p>
<p>If you turn off your tv, down some vitamin C, D and zinc every day, and stay at home if you're actually sick, then you'll be fine.</p>
<p>Turn off your tv is the most important one.</p>

        <p>Why not a 5km speed limit? It’s safer. 
Seatbelts fail so why not 2 seatbelts? It’s safer. 
Trucks fare better in crashes than sedans so let’s ban sedans? It’s safer. </p>
<p>Ultimately, we disagree on whether the precautions are reasonable or not. You think they are. I think they’re not. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, I believe the govt has gone too far. At least where I am in Canada. I can’t leave and enter my country anymore. I can’t travel. I can’t visit my friends. I can’t go to church. And every time I leave my house to go to the grocery store, I have to wear a useless cloth over my face that fogs up my glasses and makes it hard for me to see. You doomers have gone too far!</p>

        <p>Ok so if you're asymptotic, there's a pretty low chance that you have covid, statistically speaking right?  And if you do happen to have it asymptomatically, the chances of you passing it to someone else (outside of your household) are also very low, right?  But since wearing a mask may or may not reduce the already-low chance of asymptomatic spread for the low percentage of people who have asymptomatic covid, everyone in the world should wear one at all times in public?  Does that seem reasonable to you?</p>

        <p>Exactly what I usually say to people who claim that non-compliance prolongs the pandemic. Even if you happen to be an asymptomatic carrier, which is unlikely because at any given time and place less than 2% of the population is infected simultaneously, you will not be contributing to the spread as much as a sick person <em>with</em> a mask.</p>

        <p>Look at it like this, I do know that studies (actual ones) have shown that there are links to negative side effects of masks, mask mouth, cognitive issues, impaired breathing, etc.  I don't know 100% that any of that is going to be an issue with me personally,  but I do know that I'm not currently sick. So, if I'm still social distancing, me not wearing a mask isn't going to negatively effect anyone. I also know that I'm no one's responsibility but my own and the possibility of contracting an oral or lung infection is more than a minor inconvenience to me. </p>
<p>Also, this is still currently America. No one is allowed to dictate the health care of anyone else, period.</p>

Lots of people have died from cancer and studies show that areas where cell phones are stored on the body are more prone to cancer.  Maybe you should have some empathy and not selfishly infect me with your radiation machine.  Worse than a virus, 100% of cell phones emit harmful radiation, maybe you should care about others for a change.</p>
