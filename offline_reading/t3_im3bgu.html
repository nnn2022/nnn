    <strong>Are therapists helping or hurting?</strong>
    <p><p>Genuine curiosity, because we are all human and I feel like it's hard to be impartial in that line of work sometimes, although I will say I'm not a therapist so I'm just making assumptions (which may be entirely wrong). But I'm asking this because I see so many people who viscerally feel that this is all highly abnormal, and I was wondering if therapists are generally sticking to the pandemic script (I know there are exceptions). Everyone on this sub is very aware of the mental toll all of this taking on so many, and I'm curious to see if therapists are helping, or if they are just trying to mold minds into the narrative. I have never seen a therapist so I really don't know the details of therapy. And to those struggling and just need to vent to a stranger, feel free to message me.</p></p>

        <p>I'm in Australia and am a psychologist. I don't know a single psych who wasn't concerned from the start, or who would use therapy to push some pandemic script when our clients are being destroyed. That's not what therapy is for. That isn't good therapy. There are always shit professionals in every field so I don't doubt that there are psychologists and counsellors out there telling clients who can't take it anymore and talking about how it's harming them, who respond by telling their client they are selfish because pandemic and dismiss their suffering. I mean there are therapists who tell people who have been abused they are selfish so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>In person, but I am on leave for a planned trip atm. My practice stayed in person as we decided it was best for clients, who wanted it. We had a few mostly new clients who wanted telehealth, but most others wanted in person.</p>
<p>I myself would never have done virtual therapy as a client, I couldn't do it. Just no thanks. I am someone who when I had therapy needed in person contact.</p>

        <p>I can say that the overwhelming attitude in mental health where I am has been concern about the harm. I don't know about elsewhere, but anything except for respect of the obvious harm these measures cause to mental health and the suffering of your client is bad practice even if you supported lockdowns.</p>

        <p>My sister is a mental health counselor, dealing mostly with substance abuse, I think (kind of embarrassed that I haven't asked before), and while they did virtual sessions for a while, they were one of the first place I knew of that went back into the office, because the clients needed face-to-face sessions. No pushing an agenda as far as I know. I started seeing a therapist personally back in April; one session was virtual, the next was in person with masks on (but without any mention of the masks), and the third time, she asked if I was more comfortable wearing or not wearing one, and that she would do the same; that's the last time either of us mentioned it. Some are bound to push their beliefs, sure, but I think most are going to try to focus on the client's needs more than any personal beliefs.</p>

        <p>It's purely a coincidence, but in that first meeting (it was with a psychiatric NP) with the masks on, I finally got someone to listen to me regarding a needed change in psych meds, and once I started taking the new meds, I noticed an almost immediate improvement. Been going about four months now, and I honestly feel better than I have in years; if it weren't for the lockdowns, I'm sure my situation would be even better. I say that not to lord it over anyone or to belittle their struggle, but to suggest that you can still get help, medication-wise or therapy-wise, in this most ridiculous of times we live in. Despair won't last forever, and neither will the lockdowns. It can get better, if you look for help when you need it. We WILL get through this.</p>

        <p>My experience with psychotherapy even before this "pandemic" was that an agenda was  being pushed which would be complementary with "the new normal." Maybe that's just me, but maybe not. It was subtle and I'm pretty sensitive.</p>
<p>[edit: regarding above paragraph, the agenda at the time did not seem explicitly leading to "pandemic/ new normal" per se. I just mean there <em>was</em> an agenda, which seemed to originate from similar if not same "powers that be" sources.]</p>
<p>I don't use mental health professionals any more, partly because of the bullshit they need to be complicit with to be accredited to practice. Yes, there are well-meaning individuals, but a lot of their good intentions get subsumed by the inherently abusive authoritarian power dynamic, where money changes hands for an intimate conversation; where one person is a professional/ expert, the other not.</p>

        <p>Therapists don't know how to deal with this any better than anyone else, which makes them a potential danger if they are caught up in their own trauma.</p>
<p>All a therapist can, and should, be offering, is the skillset for people to be able to be responsible for their own mental and physical health.
It's not a therapists job to help, it's to get people to help themselves.</p>

        <p>I'm a therapist. I had a therapist at the beginning myself who belittled my concern about this being overblown. I saw every single thread with colleagues on social media turn into outright bullying if anyone mentioned they were seeing people in the office. They went on and on about their distancing and disinfecting strategies. Client after client goes silent or ghosts me when I challenge their paranoia. Now I just sit and nod. I'm sick of this. It's a goddamn nightmare from hell.</p>

        <p>My therapist is helping. He‚Äôs a semi-doomer but listens to me with an open mind (and even some admiration, I sense). He never moralizes or tries to belittle my anguish about all this.
