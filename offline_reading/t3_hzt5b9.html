    <strong>78% of COVID-19 patients show signs of heart damage after recovery?</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/cardiovascular-imaging/78-covid-19-patients-heart-damage-recovery">https://www.cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/cardiovascular-imaging/78-covid-19-patients-heart-damage-recovery</a></p>
<p>I found this at that <em>other</em> sub and looking at the original study referenced, a sample of only 100 people or so was used with a median age of 49. <strong>33%</strong> were hospitalized. Only <strong>18</strong> asymptomatic patients were studied. Not only is this a tiny sample, it is a poor representation of how COVID-19 cases actually turn out. The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 is <strong>not</strong> 33%.</p>
<p>The study said there was cardiac involvement in 78% of the sample with 60% being myocardial inflammation. Does involvement mean damage? I'm pretty sure that inflammation does not automatically indicate damage. Ironically, on that <em>other</em> sub, there were several upvoted comments calling this study out. I was seeing comments saying that myocarditis happens after a viral infection in general (Of course there was some doomerism, but it wasn't all doomer).</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not being dismissive of the fact that some COVID-19 patients really do have heart/lung damage after recovery, but this study is probably not a good representation and is alarmist.</p></p>

        <p>Not completely. 100 feels small but is statistically already very significant.</p>
<p>Given a population of 200k infections in Germany, you need a sample size of 96 to have a 10% margin of error with a 95% confidence level. </p>
<p>An other issue is that the sample appears not very well randomized: having 30% hospitalized patients seems a lot. Apparently the hospitalization rate is 17% in Germany..</p>
<p>How much can this possibly skew the result?</p>
<p>The influence of hospitalized patients on the final result is worst if all of the hospitalized patients have heart damage. This would mean the ratio is 13% too high. 76% minus 13% = 64%</p>
<p>So you can still be 95% sure that at least 54% of the infected population in Germany suffered from a measurable heart infection during their illness.</p>
<p>As the researchers state themselves: this is a signal that more research is needed.</p>

        <p>&rt;Given a population of 200k infections in Germany</p>
<p>Are you sure only 200k people have been infected by the virus in Germany? Are you sure they tested and traced every single, or even the majority of, infections?</p>
<p>&rt;An other issue is that the sample appears not very well randomized: having 30% hospitalized patients seems a lot. Apparently the hospitalization rate is 17% in Germany..</p>
<p>The "17% hospitalisation rate" is <strong>based on confirmed cases only</strong>. Testing is <strong>skewed towards the sickest and those hospitalised</strong> - the more severe a person's symptoms were, the more likely was he/she tested.</p>
<p>There is practically zero chance that Germany (and practically all other countries) did not miss the vast majority of asymptomatic and mild infections. Thus, the actual infection hospitalisation rate (and infection fatality rate) is much lower than the confirmed-cases only hospitalisation rate.</p>

        <p>Hi, thanks for your reply, it is estimated that the total number of infections is 3 to 5 times what is actually tested positive. Even that is an estimation so you can not be sure, nothing is sure about Corona (apart from the fact that it is super infectious). </p>
<p>However my point was that a sample size of 100 is not really considered insignificant in statistics, even when talking about a total population of 82mio, and population proportion (#infected) of somewhere between 200k and 1mio. It all comes down to margins of error. </p>
<p>The only issue I see is the sample itself, as you already point out this is always skewed towards the more ill. As a matter of fact this is pointed out in the study's limitations itself, the authors suggest themselves that more and further studies are needed for exactly the reason you are pointing out. </p>
<p>source: have worked as process engineer during several years, determination of sample sizes was part of my daily job.</p>

        <p>Is Publishing This Study an Act of Domestic Terrorism?</p>
<p>Section 802 of the USA PATRIOT Act (Pub. L. No. 107-52) defines "domestic terrorism" as an act "dangerous to human life" that is a violation of the criminal laws of a state or the United States, if the act appears to be intended to: (i) (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.</p>
<p>We know the lockdown is dangerous to human life - people are killing themselves, falling into addiction, and being denied medical services.</p>
<p>Multiple lawsuits say the lockdown is illegal.</p>
<p>Is their goal to "intimidate or coerce a civilian population" into voting out Trump? Is it to "influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion" such as forcing a federal bail-out of Blue states?</p>

        <p>What an absolute garbage study. A significant portion had preexisting conditions and the people are almost 50 years old. And it didn’t look like they took scans BEFORE they were sick, only after they had already recovered. How do you know how bad their heart was before all this? Just because you are not diagnosed doesn’t mean you don’t have diabetes or hypertension lol</p>

        <p>My wife, a pathologist, read this and says that 78 had abnormal radiologic images that would be flagged by a radiologist, yet only 3 were actually confirmed to have viral myocarditis.  Thus, this is a misrepresentation of data.  The other 75 people will probably have no issues a year from now and just because imaging shows an abnormality doesn't mean it's anything in and of itself or related to covid.  Also, doesn't rule out that it's related to it, but cannot be confirmed.</p>
