    <strong>What will it take?</strong>
    <p><p>Get the vax to avoid getting "real sick" but then you got side effects so you got "fake sick" and then bc you can still catch and transmit you caught covid and now are sick from covid anyways.</p>
<p>I never got covid, never got the vax sickness and still haven't caught delta despite not masking </p>
<p>why aren't the vax pissed about this? They blame us for them getting sick even though it was them catching it, spreading it and getting sick from it. Heck even I'M pissed off on their behalf. How dare the gov't promise this as a way out and then say "haha actually our.
 super safe and effective vaccine is neither safe nor effective so we actually have no strategy to fight this thing and are in the same position we were in January 2020 but we're just going to keeping locking down indefinitely because you're all too traumatized to ask questions."</p>
<p>im so tired</p></p>

        <p>The way it's being explained to them, THEY are at higher risk for the Delta variant because they took the "vaccine". That actually makes sense, because when you insufficiently fight and fail to destroy an illness, it comes back worse. Now combine that with the fact that their systems are customized to only fight the OG variant, they're left sorely lacking in the immunity department. </p>
<p>Because, to begin with, it isn't even that much of an issue, we're able to catch the cold, get over it, and go on with life, whereas those who had the shot aren't as able to do so anymore. </p>
<p>I think I stopped explaining what they've been told at some point, but I think that's why they're fearful either way. </p>
<p>How do you make a harmless virus deadly? </p>
<p>Answer is, you don't. You simply take away people's ability to fight off that harmless virus.</p>

        <p>This puts into words so well another issue ive been confused about for a while. </p>
<p>Which is: why two shots?</p>
<p>Have you ever had two flu shots within a month? No because (as far as i understand) the flu vaccine gives you a bit of dead flu to fight so that the NEXT time your body comes into contact with a flu cell it knows how to kill it. </p>
<p>If you get a second vax wouldn't you're body go into full arsenal attack mode and start attacking the vax is if its the real covid? Probably why the second shot is so deadly with side effects from everyone i know who too it. Also if you're body is going full gung ho to kill the vax you will be in a weakened state when an actual immune threat comes up, even if its just the common cold you might be fucked because your body is busy fighting a fake protine instead of the actual threat. </p>
<p>Also why is there no whole-virus vaccine being produced, only these half-ass rushed mrna protein vaxes? </p>
<p>Ugh.</p>

        <p>Damn that's a great point. That's how real science works, by working together (and against each other) to form an hypothesis.</p>
