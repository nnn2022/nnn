    <strong>What the fuck is happening? Is this the Matrix?</strong>
    <p><p>Winter is coming. As in any winter for the past thousands of years, infectious diseases are rising. So is coronoia. Throughout Europe and, I assume, the US, measures have tightened and compliance is high. Yet the numbers go up. Probably because the test is whack, but likely because it is an endemic seasonal virus that's simply gonna virus. It is nature, a gompertz curve. </p>
<p>Yet everywhere I go people are vitriolic towards each other. I talked to people from many different countries: Be it Mexico, Portugal, the US or Germany. They all said the exact same thing: "People are being irresponsible". Suggesting that their neighbours who walk their dog, the protestors or whoever somewhat tries to live their life must be responsible for the increase in numbers, when this is clearly impossible. It does not even make sense: Summer was when people were mostly flaunting the rules, what makes everyone think people are especially irresponsible when the weather is getting gloomier and colder? The solution: Tighten the grip, that already is extremely tight. People (mostly Karen NPCs) calling for prolonged lockdowns.</p>
<p>As if it is a surprise that the numbers are rising in goddamn winter. As if we haven't said that on this sub since spring. As if people thought that in autumn and winter everyone goes out to party and spread the virus. None of this should be a surprise and nobody should blame other people for it.</p>
<p>What is happening? I increasingly feel like I am dealing with NPC's, that this is somehow the Matrix. This is weirder than any scifi book ever written.</p></p>

        <p>It's wild beyond imagination, isn't it? If there's any way you can get out to a rural area, I highly recommend it. Things are a lot less abnormal here, and I haven't seen a single incidence of all of the nasty covid behavior I see on the web.</p>

        <p>Who is actually surprised the numbers are going up? Everybody suspected the numbers where going up in the winter, that’s why a lot of countries have tighter restrictions.. That’s also why most countries opened up in the summer.</p>
