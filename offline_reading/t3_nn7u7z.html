    <strong>I’m at a crossroads, seeking advice about the vaccine. (Potential fertility issues?)</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, I’m looking for advice about what I should do about my situation here. </p>
<p>I’m a young adult in a healthy, happy relationship and I personally do not plan on ever getting the vaccine due to concerns of long term side effects and possible fertility issues. I do my research about this stuff and try to make the best decision for myself and my loved ones. My GF on the other hand doesn’t do any research about this stuff at all and mostly just does what everyone else is doing in situations like this. </p>
<p>Me and this girl have been together for some time and I would love to have the opportunity to start a family with her in the future, but I am very concerned about the fertility issues with young woman being vaccinated. It would be heartbreaking for us to not be able to have children in the future, because she took the vaccine and for whatever reason people that take it can’t reproduce. </p>
<p>So my question is, is it worth is to try and convince her to not get the vaccine when - Her family are “medical professionals “ and are pushing her REALLY hard to get the vaccine. And the fact that pretty much everyone we know is getting the shot and we would end up being the outliers. Is it worth the struggle? I don’t want to have to move on from this girl for a reason like this where she finds out she can’t have babies in a year from now. </p>
<p>My suggestion would be if I were to talk to her about this, would be to wait at least a year to make sure there isn’t any fertility issues, then go ahead. The issue here is that, I’m basically the only one saying she shouldn’t get it and it will be me versus everyone else she knows and I most likely won’t be able to convince her. What should I do? Thoughts? </p>
<p>Anyone in relationships experience similar issues? What did you do? </p>
<p>Cheers guys and thanks!</p></p>

        <p>I stopped having sex with my spouse. I heard that people in Australia were testing positive for HIV after the vax. "False positive," they said. There was a story I read where a woman got the vaccine and her baby breastfed and then the baby died. "Just a coincidence," they said. But babies can catch HIV from mother's breast milk. </p>
<p>So if you want to go ahead and get immuno-compromised from intercourse with your vaccinated partner ... go for it!</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that. I never really wanted children, so that's not a problem for me. My husband experienced testicular pain and prostate enlargement that disrupted urination when he got his vax, so it was obviously attacking his reproductive system. Luckily, he procreated before I met him. I sit around and worry about how much longer we have together.</p>
<p>There is no convincing people not to get the vax when you're all by yourself and everyone they know is getting it and the TV is pushing its propaganda 25/8. In fact, it's better to shut your mouth right about now so that they don't come for you first when the mobs start searching for victims, pitchforks and torches in hand.</p>
<p>As a middle-aged gay man myself, I didn't get this far without HIV just to catch it from the jab. If I'm going to get HIV and then rely on the tender mercies of Big Pharma for the rest of my life, I'm going to get it the old fashioned "bug chaser" way: in a bath house sling getting gangbanged by HIV-positive strangers!</p>

        <p>I agree with the sentiment of this however I do have a problem with giving in in this way because it might encourage others that might be on the fence to get it.  "Oh well Sally got it" type thing.  </p>
<p>I'd rather stand for my convictions and lose whatever family and friends necessary.  Sort of thins your inner circle down to those you should be around anyway</p>

        <p>Yeah, I know. But sometimes it's just easier that way. My ex thinks I'm "waiting for clinical trials to be completed" so he doesn't tell a family court judge that I'm some anti-vaxx nutjob. Hopefully by then, something will change.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry, you're in a tough situation. Like, on the one hand, no matter what you say or do, she still might go ahead in taking the shot.</p>
<p>I hate to ask this, but is there a way she can just tell her parents to please wait until further studies about the long term effects about Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J/AZ come out? That should buy her some time, right?</p>

        <p>Hey thanks! Its tough </p>
<p>And the simple answer is no. Her parents are 100% sure the vaccine is safe and won’t impact her in any way. Like I said they are “health officials” and think they are 100% right. If I asked her to wait, she’d probably wonder why. Again it doesn’t make sense logically but it’s a difficult situation where there isn’t really anything I can do when her parents are health officials and she thinks they know more then me who is a history student.

<p>And look at the astonishing rates of those who suffered some ailment or received a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nkdq0o/too_many_adverse_reactions_this_guy_on_ig_is/gzd82ty/?context=3"><strong>very painful reaction taking Pfizer or Moderna</strong></a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not sure how old she is, but if she's 19 or younger, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nixps9/children_aged_12_free_ice_cream_and_live_dj_while/gz4bt2u/?context=3"><strong>then there's a 0.00017% of her dying from covid-19!!</strong></a>. So why does she need this stupid vaxx shot!?!?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinatedUncut/comments/ngx3si/the_jab_of_death_video_shows_death_rates_in_most/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>this short video</strong></a> of cases of covid rising as soon as people took the shots! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, not that I want to scare you, but <a href="https://i.redd.it/nuepa2bpd5z61.jpg"><strong>please show her this montage, and ask her to show it to her parents</strong></a>, as I don't want her to end up like them! </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously, I wish her father was more like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nmauxn/father_tries_to_bribe_daughter_with_money_to_not/"><strong>this guy</strong></a>. You can hear the love and pain he's in trying to convince her edge-lord daughter to not take the vaccine. The video was from another subreddit but I can't find it right now, but all the brainwashed people were making fun of the dad, calling him insane. Our world's fucked when people lost their ability for empathy. </p>
<p>I hope she doesn't take it. I will pray for you.</p>

        <p>My pleasure in helping out. Maybe if you’re short on time then show the link of the montage of people who died from taking the vaxx shots. We can’t prove that they died directly from the vaccine, but it would be interesting if some had no existing health issues or if some had some pre-existing conditions. I guess you could always use the line “Why play Russian Roulette with your life with an experimental gene-altering concoction that hasn’t received FDA approval?”</p>

        <p>Show her how much the CDC has flip flopped, then show her their new “PSA” about the Covid vaccine not causing fertility issues. I say this because you know they only made a PSA if many were concerned (shows her you aren’t the only one who thinks this, and shows the incompetence of the ones recommending this too).</p>

        <p>I think you should share your concerns about this with her. After all, it takes you both to create a baby. So your concerns should at least be heard and taken into account. Not that she needs to listen, but at least hear you out. </p>
<p>I dont think asking her to wait a year is unreasonable, especially if she is at low risk anyway.</p>
