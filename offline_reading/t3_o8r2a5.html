<p>For those who don’t want to visit the site here it is:</p>
<p>• We are pro-vaccine, pro-science and were excited for the opportunity to be vaccinated and to do our part in helping to end the pandemic.</p>
<p>No hope for these people</p></p>

        <p>This is the world's first and largest human experiment of all time, and so you would need at least three Control Groups who got either: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>placebos (there's anecdotal evidence that saline solution was used a lot)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weak dosages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the full dose </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone's being monitored, as the group(s) carrying out this scamdemic are looking for particular results before they roll-out the Version 2.0 in 2022, and the final Version 3.0 in 2023. This is my best guess as to how the NWO will carry-out their final plan.</p>

        <p>I'm one of a small group left at work who hasn't vaxxed, but I know several co-workers who did, as well as several managers, and here's what I saw first hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some got a sore arm, but were back to work very quickly (within a day or two). And it's been a month or two since they got their first and/or second shot, and there's been no issues for them. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some got a sore arm, but then got so sick that they were off for about 5 to 14 days, and some are still reeling after effects from their 1st or 2nd dose. In case you're wondering, some who got the 1st shot either had no issues or got sick, but still went ahead in getting their 2nd shot. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally there's a few who not only didn't get a sore arm, but didn't get any reactions at all from their 1st or 2nd shot. It's unbelievable because it just so happens those who didn't get any adverse reactions are the most loudest and obnoxious pro-vaxxers on Earth! (sigh) They fucking annoy me, as they think they're super humans &amp; are invulnerable to anything, and so they keep pestering others to get vaxxed. I fucking loathe some of them for their arrogant attitudes.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing all that info you offered on your comment above.  I think you are pretty spot on.  I always look for your comments as we follow a lot of the same subs, because you make a lot of sense with things I believe too.  So thank you and I hope you are hanging in there ok</p>

        <p>In my circle, older folks who get vaccinated seem to be just fine. It's the younger folks who are getting hit bad by different symptoms. What do you believe is their ultimate goal?</p>

        <p>I wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o8oamr/alright_lets_talk_about_the_spoon_thing_that/h36mp5n/?context=3"><strong>this</strong></a> to someone else earlier, but I was rushed into writing that, as I wanted to insert some hyperlinks to show where I was getting that information from. When I have time after work then I'll write-up something longer if you'd like, or send you a direct message or chat request, as sometimes what I write is a bit "out there", but hey, you'd never imagine we'd be seeing our local economies destroyed, our civil liberties infringed upon, and basically locked-up at home all over a damn cold, right? Message me if you have questions, preferably via the Chat feature here on Reddit.</p>

        <p>I think the reason they're saying "we are pro-vaccine..." is to set the stage and frame their intentions as not to seem like their overall distrust for vaccines in general were the driving force behind this site but rather their first hand experiences with THIS vaccine in particular. In other words to make it more credible. </p>
<p>As an example, in general, I'm "pro-vaccine" and think <em>some</em> make sense and my overall feeling about them is that they're really great for our society. I disagree with a lot of vaccines (HPV, flu) for most people and think kids should receive <em>way</em> less than they do. Additionally, I am VERY opposed to this one and would only recommend for those in the high risk category.</p>
