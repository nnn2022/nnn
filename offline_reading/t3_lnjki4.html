    <strong>Imagine</strong>
    <p><p>Imagine if I came up with a new form a birth control that supposedly prevents STDs and pregnancy. But here’s the catch: ever since this birth control was approved by the FDA, the government now recommends everyone to wear twice the amount of protection; it doesn’t matter if you’re taking my birth control or not, the government will still say to use twice the amount of protection. That’s the COVID vaccine for you. The recommendation of wearing 2 masks wasn’t mainstream until after the vaccination arrived. A smart person, or just a person with basic common sense, would say this vaccination obviously doesn’t work if we still have to lockdown and wear not just one, but two masks. But these college educated wokies will say that vaccinations work for some reason. </p>
<p>Remember back in March and February of last year they said that masks aren’t necessary? Well guess what, everywhere now requires you to wear a muzzle on your face. The same fate will happen to these vaccines. They’ll soon become mandatory. If you don’t get the vaccine, you won’t be able to go to work or school/college, you won’t be able to go to the grocery store,etc. Worst part is, these vaccines can cause serious complications. Take me for example, I have secondary amenorrhea and a couple of other health issues. If you don’t know what amenorrhea is: it’s a condition where you’re unable to menstruate. This condition rises the risk of infertility by quite a bit. You know what else rises the risk of infertility? These COVID vaccines. If I take this vaccine, the possibility of me not being able to have children, or even never having a menstrual cycle again, is quite high. And I doubt amenorrhea will be a valid exception for these vaccines. </p>
<p>So for all you doomer that browse our community: when will enough be enough? Why are the supposed cures for this virus so much worse than the sickness that derives from it? Are complications from these lockdowns, masks, and vaccines worth it?</p></p>
