    <strong>Anybody know anybody that has blood clots or has had a heart attack from the shot</strong>
    <p><p>I'm starting to have my doubts about how dangerous the shot is</p>
<p>I don't know anybody personally that has died from covid but supposedly my family all knows people even though they're older + 50 they weren't really like decrepit </p>
<p>every day more people supposedly have reactions to the vaccines and yet I still haven't really met a person in my own life</p>
<p>I've been pretty heavy covid is bs for a long time</p>
<p>Haven't worn a mask since February but before then I wore it all the time</p>
<p>I literally never felt any differently and I don't fear covid at all at this point I'm just starting to wonder if I've been gas-lit into some BS political shit</p>
<p>I fully believe the governments of the world want to get rid of cash and Institute a universal digital identity </p>
<p>I don't think covid is very dangerous I think it's probably just a means to an end </p>
<p>at the same time I don't want to be labeled as an outcast and I am starting to try to date again after a long time and I feel like a freak telling a girl I'm not vaccinated</p></p>

        <p>In my circle of friends and extended family I've known of two seemingly healthy people die of sudden heart attacks within a week of being vaccinated (one used to go to the gym regularly) and I've only known one person having covid (mild symptoms).</p>

        <p>I got blood clots, still recovering now. When I went to the ER met another lady with the same. Later found an old buddy of mine same. Then told a workmate of a friend back in UK was paralyzed, later died. The guy who told me about the old buddy also knows a coworker who died very shortly after the vaccine, then sent me a chat screenshot about another one.</p>
<p>So 3 deaths and 3 people with heart problems and blood clots. During this same period have heard of exactly 1 person dying from covid, and they were 81 years old. All the above injured or killed were below 60.</p>

        <p>Touch wood, OK now, other than getting tired easily - but that could be emotionally drained from all this bullshit? Still getting heart palpitation that keep me awake, which isn't helping.</p>
<p>Last specific symptom per se was a blood clot in my finger. Was numb and tingly, then someone pointed out the side of my finger was blue. Fixed it myself by alternating between hot and cold water.</p>
<p>OK, bried overview - 35 mins after 1st dose, 'transient' stroke, paralyzed right arm. That recovered by itself but then heart went crazy for more than a week, high pressure, false pulse, then chest pains. Heart hospital claimed nothing to do with the vaccine (WTF?) and then literally met a lady who overheard my symptoms and who had the same, but for her 11 days after the shot.</p>

        <p>Nope, that's American, I'm in Malaysia. The Malaysian phone app has a link for reporting side effects but it vanishes after 24 hours. </p>
<p>I did eventually find an online portal for reporting adverse reactions to drugs in general, and gave the drug as Sinovac and the batch number. Found with that system there's no case number or feedback, just a 'Thank you for your report' screen and that's it.</p>

        <p>Hey dude.</p>
<p>You can only do what you think is right man. Noone should tell you whether or not it's a good thing for you.</p>
<p>But if your main reasons are feeling like an outcast, that's probably not a great reason. </p>
<p>Like you, I don't know anyone irl that has suffered a bad reaction although most people say it hurts an awful lot which to me is just a red flag.</p>
<p>I also don't think all of the crying mums with injured kids or lifelong problems are faking it, maybe some of the posters here are who really knows but you can't fake that kind of emotion on video.</p>
<p>At the end of the day noone knows how this will play out but creating a sense of urgency like the media and governments all across the world are doing is a classic con man/sales tactic and another red flag to me.</p>
<p>What would happen if just for arguments sake, we did find out that the vaccine made you sterile. How would you feel about telling your girlfriends you weren't vaccinated in that kind of future?</p>

        <p>Nah you’re not allowed to ask questions about the vaccine dangers in a positive sense. You have to demonise the vaccines. </p>
<p>Just in another post someone made an absolute statement about breaching blood brain barrier and what that would mean when there is zero evidence to show what the mechanisms is. I just pointed that out, nothing more and people downvoted me over 37 votes.</p>

        <p>Friend, early 30s, had covid in February, came up with a huge clot (ankle to hip) that needed to be surgically removed. Then, for some reason, got vaccinated and now has another clot in femoral artery (while taking blood thinners!). Scary stuff</p>

        <p>Every week at work my boss is upset about one of his friends passing away of heart issues or strokes. Have no clue if it’s vaccine related, but they have all been vaccinated I’m assuming being older (60+) in a very blue state. My boss was vaccinated and had open heart surgery prior to it. One employee got vaccinated, had anxiety before the shot, after the shot, 2 weeks go by and dude has just walked away. Don’t know where He is, he’s 60 too. My MIL has fallen quite a few times despite being very active after getting Vacxed. She’s an alcoholic but has never fallen and I would say her drinking is completely unrelated since after the vaccine was introduced it started happening. My BIL had a friend come over and he didn’t drink or smoke and just got up and walked away in the basement. Dude completely blacked out and face planted, hitting his jaw on the floor, lost all his front teeth from having them pushed an inch into his gums. Life’s fucked. I can’t say for sure if any of this is related but I’m having a hard time seeing them as unrelated</p>

        <p>I know of 4 people who came down with CV19.  Two didn't know until they were tested (with that sketchy pcr test).  One of those still doesn't think he had it.</p>
<p>One is severely overweight and tends to exaggerate anyway and said its the worst thing ever.  He seems totally fine.</p>
<p>The fourth didn't say much about it.</p>
<p>Most people here where I work have had their shots so far as I know.  I don't ask.  Only one person in the above group has had a reaction but it wasn't as drastic as blood clotting or strokes.</p>
<p>My sample set is very small.</p>

<p>I’ve had multiple elderly clients, all with heart disease, one lady obese. They were a few weeks post second dose and as far as I know, are still normal.</p>
<p>I can think of roughly 10-12 people have had it, none of the adverse effects thank god. </p>
<p>Regardless, I’m not keen on mrna until phase 3 trials are completed and they have adequately understood the mechanism behind mrna breaching the blood brain barrier (moderna has confirmed that it has).</p>

        <p>I went on a first date with the healthy 35-year-old woman who told me she developed “blood clots in [her] kidneys” two weeks after the Moderno vaccine. It was her second dose. Of course she had to be hospitalized and was currently on anticoagulants. She didn’t have any risk factors for blood clots such as tobacco use or estrogen use or recent surgeries or a history of cancer. The logical person would agree that the vaccine caused her blood clots. Especially when the spike protein is known to cause blood clots.</p>

        <p>Since getting the Pfizer, my dad is now "tired all the time" and "short of breath." He also had an incident on the road where there was confusion, where he didn't understand where he was or what to do. (At the end of his block.) It was bad enough that he consulted his doctor and got a cognitive function test.</p>
<p>Yeah, he's 75. But this decline started after he got the vaccine.</p>
<p>Coincidence??</p>
<p>He's also sick now, with a terrible cough. I am not optimistic for his future.</p>
<p>PS. He's said, "These shots don't last forever. I hope there is another one soon for the... the... uhm... The.. The uh. (pause) What's ... That thing... That.... That thing we're supposed to be worried about?"</p>
<p>Me: "The Delta variant?"</p>
<p>Him: "Yeah! Yeah."</p>
<p>tl:dr; My dad, 75, took the Pfizer vaccine and within a couple weeks began a rapid decline. It's been 2-3 months now and he is sick with a cough and is having cognitive issues. :-/</p>

        <p>A 17 year old I know had a heart attack two days after second Pfizer shot...he had a fever beforehand and thought his left arm pain was from the injection but got his mom to take him to the hospital when he felt like the sun was exploding in his chest...he was healthy and fit and was going to work as a lifeguard this summer. Thankfully he's been ok physically tho he has been advised nothing strenuous for 6 months ( this happened May 1st) but mentally and emotionally he has been hit hard.</p>

        <p>not sure about clotting but my 30yo athletic friend had a seizure for the first time in her life hours after the vaccine, needed like 5-6 stitches in her face</p>
<p>cousin of another friend had such severe menstrual hemorrhage for over a month her uterus had to be partially surgically removed</p>
<p>every woman i know except for one had a period at least 3 weeks late after one or both of their shots</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>touch wood none of my friends have had anything severe like a stroke but... almost everyone i know who took it had "pretty bad" SEs like way, way worse than you would ever get from any other vaccine or COVID (this age group) most likely</p>

        <p>The vaccines cause slow build-up of blood and brain clotting in the vast majority of people. All the studies say that in about 6 months they'll be dropping like flies. They were meant to kill very slowly, but of course some of the vaccinated die immediately. The clots are micro clots only detected through a d-dimer test, they build eventually to one big clot. Most people who get the second dose have terrible reactions and get sick for at least 2 days as an initial immune reaction, then slow clotting begins.</p>
