<p>They gotta do it themselves... try to force a decision like this would backfire methinks.</p>

        <p>It’s just that. When you have a totalitarian state like China or North Korea, the way the big guys are able to stay in power and get all the resources for themselves is propaganda. Brainwashing. Mind tricks. It’s how COVID is being perpetuated as well and the oil and cogs of this whole mess. </p>
<p>I feel like the best solution would be to educate others on propoganda and how it works in a somewhat aggressive way. Right now the world is so susceptible to it, especially through shows on the television, Netflix, and of course the MSM. A lot of it is purposefully devised to control the population through their minds and biases. </p>
<p>This was fine and okay when they were trying to make us buy Ugg’s and Pepsi and vote a former local basketball player for small town Mayer but it’s just gone too too far, and enough is enough, and people really shouldn’t be falling for these tricks anymore. I mean, this could get quite bad otherwise. </p>
<p>Thankfully I know a lot of people see through it, but not enough! Thoughts?</p>

        <p>It's definitely a challenge... you nailed it with Covid being a propaganda tool.  The saying that it's easier to fool people than to convince them that they've been fooled comes into play but that seems to be the key.  </p>
<p>The key could be to articulate how not only have people been brainwashed into participating in medical experimentation but also their children- to fight a virus variant that generally gives people a really bad cold.  The big difference is THIS once gets government-funded press and media coverage.  </p>
<p>For that, we're demanding to be overgrown lab rats and take an experimental injection that has not been tested because that's been sold as the easiest path back to a way of life we've allowed to be stolen from us thanks to a fear campaign.</p>
