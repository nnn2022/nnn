        <p>They couldnt be more right, i am more than happy to be part of the natural selection process and trust my own immune system to keep me safe rather than compromise it by taking an untested inefficient genetic therapy</p>

        <p>It is strange its almost like they have tunnel vision in the sense that in their eyes we need some kind of "solution"</p>
<p>I think it might just be that they don't want to admit that maybe just maybe they were tricked into thinking this was a bit more of a big deal than it was at least in Ontario. not taking away form anyone who died or had this heck my father did and I took care of him.</p>
<p>but if you really things the ends justify the means which pro lockdowns do you probably got all your numbers off CBC without knowing how they counted a "covid" death</p>
<p>and these people have not educated themselves on previous pandemics like the influenza pandemic of 1913 where 2 million people died in 1 month coming home from the war... blows this out of the water</p>
<p>Or the previous sars pandemic in Toronto years and years ago they solved that by having a huge concert one of the biggest in Canada because people were scared to travel there! my PArents went to it apparently it was crazy it's insane people don't talk about that more. Because even tho that was a coronavirus true and true most people arent educated enough to make the comparison I guess</p>

<p>why did the mods remove my post ffs</p>

        <p>I find it strange these people truly do want to move on and get back to normal per se but they have a mental block in the sense that in their eyes we need some kind of "solution"</p>
<p>Keep in mind many places around the world have opened up many places similar to Ontario in size and close in geography like Michigan never locked down nearly as hard and are doing the same eg cases</p>
<p>Denmark opened up at 20% vaccinated but for some reason, these people that want the same thing as us to live life again never have the thought that maybe what happened was not needed</p>
<p>In Ontario, we have 14 million people and 1,076 million km2 of land in Ontario.... Compare that to somewhere like the greater Los angles area that has 18 million people and 12,562 km2..... It was utter insanity what happened always was</p>
<p>But they have a mental block where they cant see it as overreach they see it as needed to stop the virus so therefore we cant just get rid of that stuff we need to have a solution to get rid of it.</p>
<p>When in reality all we have to do is stop forcing masks and make them recommended not required like Alberta and BC and many people would be much happier in Ontario.</p>
<p>IMO Nobody should be forced/coerced to take it but beyond that, some people legitimately shouldn't take the vaccine for health reasons such as my mother who has Asthma and Kidney problems which all of the therapies say do not take if you have so I don't understand how so many people in Ontario have fallen victim to this and it makes me depressed daily!</p>
