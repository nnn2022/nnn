    <strong>What if the virus is real but the social engineering is too?</strong>
    <p><p>I am not an anti-masker but agree with problems with Covid and have concerns about it.</p>
<p>https://fivehundredpoundpeeps.blogspot.com/2020/08/the-social-engineering-of-covid19.html</p>
<p>Have any you considered that anti-maskers especially among conservatives and evangelicals, are just pawns who helped to spread it to rural and remote areas?</p>
<p>I know too many who got it or had loved ones die. One friend almost died, to go with those who claim it's fake, but as you can see I have concerns about it being USED.</p></p>

        <p>Nope real. You anti-maskers are being used too. The social engineering is happening though, but in a way you don't realize.</p>

        <p>A ton of people are liberals here, dude. Besides, saying current situation is an overreaction =/= fake virus/hoax. </p>
<p>It's a virus, not a boogeyman. You can acknowledge the virus is real and take certain precautions for those most affected (nursing homes, severely obese etc.) Without destroying everyone's livelihoods in the process. </p>
<p>If you wanna have an honest discussion, awesome. I'm in. But if you're just here to say how wrong you think we are, thanks for your input and have a great day.</p>

        <p>Deciding to not wear masks because it's "just a virus" you may as well be one of the people who believe it's a hoax. The virus kills and is making people permanently disabled and some with heart problems. Life long disability is not some easy thing to brush off. If they left everything open, all businesses etc, it would have spread far more, how is that a solution?</p>

        <p>If you could provide me your sources on the long term damage, I'd really appreciate it. Every study I saw was either incredibly small sample size, had no control (i.e. no previous scans done before falling ill) or was almost entirely discredited, in the case of the jama network study. If you want me to provide those links, let me know.</p>
<p>Regardless... I don't know how else to say this, but just being alive is a constant risk. Every moment there are threats to every human's life on earth, both big and small. It's just how life is. The flu can cause long term damage. Colds can cause long term damage. Most anything can cause that if you're unlucky enough, but we don't shut the world down over it!! Please, send me any studies, anything, that shows the lockdowns helped. In addition, what's your answer to Sweden, who hardly used masks at all? </p>
<p>The lockdowns are hurting people, right now. They're killing people, both now and in the future through missed cancer screenings and deferred surgeries. Why do their lives not matter?</p>
