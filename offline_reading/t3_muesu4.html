        <p>You know that wishing death on others won't change anything right ? Lol </p>
<p>We are ALL gonna die one day don't worry :)</p>
<p>People aren't endangering others simply because they do not agree with the restrictions of the area they live in.It is far from being only about masks,there's people from many different countries here.</p>
<p>Also,If you believe in the asymptomatic spread,how do you know you didn't infect someone by accident ?</p>
<p>Maybe 2 years ago you accidently infected someone with influenza and that person died,how would you know ? That's how life works,bacterias and viruses were here long before us,there will never be 100% risk free human contacts.</p>

        <p>You might have some sort of point if the vaccine actually helped stopped the spread but, as it is, you can still get covid and spread it even with the vaccine, all it does is "lessen the symptoms" in the vaccinated. So... if the vaccine doesn't stop the spread, and a healthy individual isn't worried for their own health, why does it matter whether that person gets it?</p>
<p>If you're worried about your own health, more power to you getting the vaccine, but don't pretend you're some savior for doing so.</p>

        <p>There's no point to be made. If enough "healthy" people want to wear a mask forever I'm cool with it lol. Just know it's not gonna go away by not doing anything. If enough people got vaccinated you wouldn't have to worry about the spread because symptoms are mild for most of the population as you said earlier. You choose Mask forever or a vaccine. There's No point to be made, it is your choice.</p>

        <p>So you're saying we should just prostate ourselves and let big daddy government stick whatever he wants into us? Nah, I'm good thanks. I think the government should stay out of dictating what we should wear especially at the cost of us jumping through their hoops for the privilege. That said, if a business wants to mandate mask policy anyway (or any clothing policy!), more power to them. Let the consumers/dollars speak for themselves!</p>

        <p>That’s not. The Pfizer and Modern vaccines most certainly prevent you from contracting the virus and spreading the virus.   You should still be careful after getting the vaccine but don’t spread misinformation. </p>

        <p>Provide your proof because everything I'm seeing is "may" and "still learning the effects". Which is also why I used "lessen the sympyoms" in quotes. We don't really know what these vaccines do yet and I'm not interested in being a guinea pig for them nor do I expect anyone else to be.</p>

        <p>You can read research and use those findings to make better decisions with your own brain. I could be like you and go into a situation with no knowledge and go with what is most convenient.

        <p>Research is what lead me to my current beliefs. Your comment is a waste of words.</p>
<p>Have you researched how masks are useless at keeping out a virus and how asymptomatic spread isn’t a thing? I have and that’s why I’m rebelling and saying we need to overthrow our systems of power because they are corrupt to the core.</p>
<p>The info is all out there it’s just whether you choose to research or consume fear mongering propaganda designed to make elites a lot of money and to make you dumb.</p>

Thanks for asking, that's pretty kind. Especially from you, crazy people.</p>

        <p>“...there was no difference between wearing and not wearing facemask for coronavirus droplets transmission of particles of &rt;5 µm.” Seems like the point you’re referencing.
Buy what about particles of &lt;5? </p>
<p>I guess the counter would be that later they noted:
“the overall findings showed reduced risk of virus transmission with facemasks”</p>
<p>Curious if you have read this study and your thoughts on it:</p>

        <p>Well since asymptomatic has been proven to not spread, the only time a mask would be effective is if the person had symptoms and yelled.or sneezed on you.  Seems  if they had symptoms they should be quarantined so us healthy people can go about our lives without masks.  Gee, just like any other previous contagious disease, who would have thunk?</p>

        <p>They don't. Why not?</p>
<p>Because to protect yourself from a virus you need a CBRN mask. A CBRN mask which BY THE WAY only protects one way - in, not out. So if you are sick wearing a CBRN mask (which is the military gear for protection against Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear threats) you're still exhaling particles out of the mask through the vent, but not in through the filter. </p>
<p>Which ding ding ding means even if the blue surgical mask was meant to stop particles from coming in (which it isn't) it means it's not very good at particles from coming out either. </p>
<p>It's almost as if virus particles are extremely tiny. Lol. Also, if you're about to say "but muh water droplets" go outside when it's cold and exhale. All that mist coming out of your mouth are water droplets. Microscopic tiny water droplets. They go through cloth and they are lighter than air. </p>
<p>Einstein would be very frowny at you thinking you can control physics and fluid dynamics with a tiny little 2$ mask. Cheers! Stop it. Get some help.</p>

        <p>Holy fuck, do you have a single wrinkle in your brain? Jesus.</p>
<p>I really value my time and I don't usually respond to stupidity of this level, but it's interesting at an educational level, so I'll spend some time explaining some of the basics that any half-wit can understand.</p>
<p>&rt;Because to protect yourself from a virus you need</p>
<p>Nobody's talking about protecting themselves against a virus with a piece of cloth in front of your face. You reduce the chance of infecting others by wearing a mask, and you reduce the chance of the virus spreading.</p>
<p>&rt;Which ding ding ding means even if the blue surgical mask was meant to  stop particles from coming in (which it isn't) it means it's not very  good at particles from coming out either.</p>
<p>This is FACTUALLY WRONG. If you ever, ever opened a book about anything related to physics, you would know about a physical phenomenon called AERODYNAMICS. A barrier in front of your stupid mouth prevents the air shooting forward, slows it down or redirects it elsewhere. That's why people get foggy glasses when they are wearing masks - the air exits through the top of the mask.</p>
<p>Now, knowing that you're an idiot of the highest levels, I'll put it down plainly for you:</p>
<p>VIRUS GO FAR = BIG CHANCE VIRUS SPREAD</p>
<p>VIRUS NO GO FAR = SMALLER CHANCE VIRUS SPREAD</p>
<p>I hope you don't get a nosebleed or something reading this. Good luck dodging natural selection, asshat.</p>

        <p>And btw speaking of aerodynamics you do know that when there is a sharp corner the air velocity going around the corner increases right, like when there is wind on a downtown street and you go on the side of a building and wonder wtf why is the wind faster/stronger here? So all of these plexiglass barriers aren't doing jack shit either? Get an education, and a brain.</p>

        <p>&rt;And btw speaking of aerodynamics you do know that when there is a sharp corner the air velocity going around the corner increases right, like when there is wind on a downtown street and you go on the side of a building and wonder wtf why is the wind faster/stronger here? So all of these plexiglass barriers aren't doing jack shit either? Get an education, and a brain.</p>
<p>That's why you shouldn't be speaking of aerodynamics and you should be reading about aerodynamics. </p>
<p>NO, just no. To whatever you think you said, no. </p>
<p>I think you're trying to describe a vortex? But like, having a seizure at the same time? </p>
<p>If what you said was true, F1 cars and planes would be shaped like bricks.</p>
<p>If you're so educated, why are you using this monkey terminology? "You know when you go outside, and fart? And scratch your but? And the sun is shining? That means the sun gives you the farts" </p>
<p>Imagine being so disconnected from the world that you would think that a physical barrier cannot stop air and accelerates it. I am literally laughing out loud.</p>
<p>Oh man, thanks for the giggles.</p>

        <p>More than 567,000 Americans died, its not a false fear. Covid is actually deadly. Either get the vaccine or you will get corona and could risk dying. You really want to put your life on the risk just to own the libs? I mean come on I actually care about you guys and you need to wise up and stop this.</p>

<p>Fact: my mother is 63 and has type 2 diabetes which allegedly is a very big sign of concern if you get covid. She got the virus, felt somewhat bad, tired, weak, but that's all. End of story. No major bs, recovered, is back on her feet with her normal life. So did my dad who is 65 but with no other underlying conditions.</p>

        <p>Really? Because what I’m talking about is this guy making a wild claim about the death rate and then not responding to any of the people who ask how he got that idea. It should be extremely obvious that projection isn’t even applicable to this scenario.</p>

        <p>I believe he, or somebody else below corrected that number to 0.3% elsewhere in the thread here, which is accurate. Meanwhile, the MSM and the entire Democratic Party (not to mention many Republicans, to be fair) just say blatantly false stuff as a manner of course, and it never gets checked at all.</p>

<p>It is utterly absurd to call anyone who dies for ANY REASON within 28 days of a positive test a victim of the virus, but hospitals receive FAT PAYMENTS FOR "COVID" DIAGNOSES, AND EVEN FATTER PAYMENTS FOR "COVID" HOSPITALIZATIONS.</p>
<p>If the same criteria were used every year to judge "cold and flu deaths" it would appear that the Black Plague had returned each winter. </p>
<p>Furthermore, even with all the blatant stat-padding, the average age of a "Covid death" just happens to be <em>EXACTLY THE SAME AS LIFE EXPECTANCY.</em></p>
<p>That means that this virus, like many other coronaviruses and flu viruses, amounts to what is called a harvesting event.</p>
<p>The people supposedly dying from this are either 1) totally miscategorized and died from something completely unrelated, or 2) on the verge of death already, and will be claimed by the first illness that comes along, just like every winter.</p>

You can find a link to the paper on Twitter. Oh wait, you can’t find a link to it because they’ve censored/removed it because they felt it was “dangerous” material.

        <p>Underrated comment right there. You guys don't care about covid because it has a 99.8 survival rate but you fear a vaccine with an adverse reaction rate of 0.003 and a fatality rate far smaller than that. You guys do know one of the very first reported cases of covid was a British backpacker still in his twenties, in his prime and physically very fit and his lungs collapsed. Your lucky that -ImOnTheReddit- actually cares about you worthless pieces of sh**. Personally, I couldn't be bothered as I'd take your deaths as a result of simple natural selection, it would reduce the number of fools on earth and I'm fine with that.</p>

        <p>No I mean the videos of the one guy sitting on a beach meditating with the seven cops surrounding him and dragging him off. Or the videos of the dozens of people sitting out in the park by themselves getting surrounded by cops and dragged off. Or the videos of random people walking down the street by themselves with nobody around and cops jumping them and beating the s*** out of them and dragging them off. The fact that your cherry picking the business situation shows that you're totally unconcerned with the fact of cops dragging random people off the streets and far more concerned with people obeying the will of their Rich Masters</p>

        <p>“Breaking the law” can describe a broad array of behaviors. Killing someone is breaking the law. Possessing marijuana in my state is also breaking the law. Any reasonable person would acknowledge that arresting someone for race is not much more fucked up than arresting someone for violating any of our countless stupid laws that have no business being in place.</p>
<p>So no, simply “breaking the law” without any other context doesn’t legitimately justify arrest. That depends on the action itself, and you should know that actions shouldn’t be judged by sole virtue of whether they’re legally permissible.</p>

        <p>Is it just me, or has the brigading gotten a lot worse around here lately? A consequence of this sub getting more popular I'm sure, but I have a sneaking suspicion it's a bit more insidious than that. Public approval of all the bullshit surrounding the wu-flu is dwindling, more people are flouting mask mandates as states are dropping them and <em>somehow</em> aren't carting off corpses by the wagon full, shot sites are overstocked with unused vials as most people aren't rushing out to beg to be injected. This has to be putting doomers in a panic.</p>

        <p>i‘m not in fear. just careful, i also do believe many regulations are not making sense, but whenever the state does something, they choose a middle way thats half good for everybody. but tbh i get it, so many people in different areas want different things, pressure of constant rising death numbers and everything else leads to decisions that will not be perfect.
although i think people in this subreddit just overdo it, and we all want our freedom back, but not on the costs of other peoples lifes, also i think especially for americans it‘s hard because most regulations do not protect yourself (like masks) and are for other people. americans were never good at doing something, or taking themselves back for others (not all of course).</p>
<p>And the biggest irony here is, people that follow the laws are the sheep and snowflakes, but who is crying over a piece of fabric? 
Do we need to discuss political decisions, YES! 
Should we follow everytbibg blindly without questioning? NO! 
although creating this much chaos, continuing to seperate a whole country, not being open for any input is not helping at all.. 
also those half ass facts here from facebook groups are not doing y‘all any favor, instead you guys just get anxious and fear whats coming and are just as dumb as people that go crazy over corona.</p>

<p>No, sir, this is where you are very, very wrong. We have been, and will continue do something about it, and low-IQ cavemen soy boys like yourself (as your projection revealed) can't do anything to stop us but bitch and moan, and pound the keys on your keyboards like the petulant little sheep that you are. Such a sad existence you have carved out for yourself. I'd laugh a you, if you weren't so sad. Instead, you get my pity, and you'll just have to suck it up when you're confronted with the reality that you and your kind are weak, and ineffectual.</p>

        <p>Hey now you axhieved something with me. Your "rant about how the world changes and you're just a temper tantrum throwing child for not changing with it" brought me back to a moment of my childhood. My mom wanted me to go somewhere and I didn't feel like it. So she lied to me. Told me that our food was going to run out I power was going to get turned off and our lives are going to be totally over. Naturally out of fear I obeyed. When we got there turns out none of that stuff is true she was just lying to me to get me to go where she wanted me to go. Turns out she was making a drug run to go get some pills. Taught me a big life lesson. If somebody is lying to you frightening you scaring you telling you that life in and of itself is going to end unless you obey who was your told, it's probably cuz they're drug addicts with ulterior motives...</p>

        <p>More like the doctors are scaring everyone to make massive amounts of profit off of their drugs. The government's funding the doctors because the restrictions help the government make massive amount of money and maintain an unprecedented level of control. The restrictions ruin people's businesses that the bank buys up so that the bank can make lots of money and eventually control virtually all commerce, which obviously can then be restricted because you won't listen to the doctors. And the banks funds government to push restrictions and incentivize doctors to push fear in order to complete the circle of a never ending money making scam. It's really not that complicated. Somebody sticks a gun in your face and says hey "you want to go back to normal? You want this gun out of your face? Then give me money it's the only way you can go back to normal, you know without this gun in your face that I'm putting in your face. All right now give me your business too, now take this card keep it on you at all times, now put this mask on your face now turn around and start walking and don't stop till you get back to your house. You wanna go back to normal right? The normal where I'm not threatening you with a gun? Okay then obey the gun wielding maniac and maybe, just maybe, if your lucky, the gun wielding Maniac will take the gun out of your face and finally allow you to live your life normally again..."</p>

        <p>Alright, then what do you propose, what's your solution, that we go about as if nothing was wrong, putting people who aren't fortunate enough to have strong immune systems at risk, that's the problem with you guys, you offer no actual solution, if people like you could come together and figure out a solution that's better and safer than what the government has given us, then people would actually listen to you, you think we don't know that there's problems with this whole thing, we're not idiots, we know there's people who will take advantage of this situation, the problem is no one has come up with a better option, one that resolves the problems that you're talking about, while also resolving the threats that covid causes, a lot of us don't want to live our lives like this, but we don't want to live with the worry that one day we'll get infected with covid while we're visiting a friend that has a weak immune system or an old family member like our grandparents, and that we'll accidentally get them killed, hospitalized, or make them go bankrupt due to medical bills because we accidentally infected them, as long as groups like this one continue the way they're going, they will keep being ridiculed because all you're doing is shouting "mask bad, forced vaccine bad etc" then when we ask "alright then what would you do about the rapid spread of covid to avoid it spreading and possibly hurting or killing our loved ones" you can provide no answer</p>

        <p>&rt;Alright, then what do you propose, what's your solution, that we go about as if nothing was wrong, putting people who aren't fortunate enough to have strong immune systems at risk,</p>
<p>All right see here's where I draw issue and where I'm going to go full conspiracy theorist and you probably might as well just go ahead and sign off cuz I know you will refuse to respond or do anything to address what I'm saying. The United Nations sanctioned funded and controlled a viral research facility in wahan China. That viral research facility is where the virus came from. So all this b<strong><em>*</em></strong> about doing something about the people that are "at risk" the United Nations, the people responsible for the creation and release of the covid-19 virus are responsible for the "risk" to people's safety. Plain and simple. One guy did not eat bat soup and then magically infect his globetrotting philanthropist friends who just so happened to spread the virus around the world. That's just a flat-out impossibility.</p>
<p>&rt;you offer no actual solution, if people like you could come together and figure out a solution that's better and safer</p>
<p>Countless solutions, life-altering, life saving, life changing technologies are being held in complete control by various patent offices around the world. Widespread manufacturer of some of these technologies could practically eliminate poverty food production water production electricity production you name it. For literal decades people have been coming up with solutions, water powered cars, hempcreek ecosystem biodome houses, revolutionary homeopathic medical technologies. People offer solutions all the f<strong>*</strong>* time. Those solutions are bought up suppressed or"debunked" without really replicating the experiments. We offered tons of solutions you just call them "conspiracy theories" cuz that's what you're indoctrinated to think.</p>
<p>&rt;the problem is no one has come up with a better option, one that resolves the problems that you're talking about, while also resolving the threats that covid causes</p>
<p>Yeah that's precisely my point covid was designed to be a threat that you can't top without complete obedience. It's a full-blown blatant fact that the number of covid cases were blown way out of proportion. It's a full-blown fact that covid deaths were blown away out of proportion. People killed in motorcycle accidents were listed as covid deaths. "The threats that covid proposes" are minuscule compared to the media coverage it gets. "This disease is such an incredible threat we had to lie about how deadly it was for the first 6 months then fabricate how contagious it was for the next 6 months and then continue lying about how deadly it is for the remainder of the year" your argument about what do we do about this "deadly virus" falls on deaf ears buddy, it ain't that deadly. Cuz it's not designed to be.</p>
<p>&rt;we don't want to live with the worry that one day we'll get infected with covid while we're visiting a friend that has a weak immune system or an old family member like our grandparents, and that we'll accidentally get them killed, hospitalized, or make them go bankrupt due to medical bills because we accidentally infected them</p>
<p>"We have to live in fear cuz ifs and butts and maybe its what could bees and possibly maybe what if what if what if!?!?! Oh the humanity!" Do people spend their entire lives in hurricane shelters because one day there may be a hurricane? Do people walk around wearing hazmat suits 24 hours of the day 7 days a week because they might get a sunburn? The entire planetary communities shut down because of swine flu bird flu zika H1N1 AIDS tuberculosis? It's one thing to get in your car and put a seat belt on before you drive. It's another thing entirely to put on an entire bomb proof bulletproof suit Day in day out for the rest of your life on the off chance that you one day might drive. No society could progress like that.</p>

        <p>&rt;you're a kid throwing a tantrum because he can't go see his friends for a while</p>
<p>No, actually I'm an adult, who's taken his 4 kids all over the country this past year to enjoy the freedom God and the forefathers of this country gave us, in states that are not locked down, without wearing masks, and acting like the sky is falling in. People like you, who have stopped living because of a lie you've been fed are the ones I feel bad for. You're the ones having tantrums because we won't stop living our lives like you've chosen to do for yourselves. Sorry, that's not how life works. You don't get to choose what I do, or how I live my life. Because I am not a kid. Only kids sit down, and mindlessly obey when their authorities tell them what to do. Seeing the reality now?</p>

<p>Sure, because the US government has never, ever lied to its citizens. Career politicians and big pharma-funded experts (the same industry that paid doctors to say cigarettes are healthy for your lungs) are <em>totally, totally</em> trustworthy, and have never done shady things to American citizens for personal gain. How silly of me, you're right. Let me go ahead and take this vaccine that hasn't been tested for long term side effects, never mind the fact that 3 out of 4 of the vaccine manufacturers are serial felons that have collectively paid out billions of dollars in damages to families affected by the opioid crisis they helped to spur on.</p>
<p>Sure. You're right, if we just listen to the government from here on out, nothing bad will ever happen again. I'm just so happy you enlightened this sub that I'm gonna go take the jab, and if it kills me, I dont have to worry about pesky life insurance covering my funeral expenses, because no life or health insurance company is covering you if you experience side effects or death from any of these vaccines!!! </p>
<p><em>YOU'RE SO RIGHT BRO THANK YOU OMG</em></p>

<p>You dont have to care about brazil but you have to realize the US govt doesnt have the ability to close down all countries worldwide. So your theory doesnt make sense.</p>

<p>It's not so much a conspiracy, so much as governments (humans) once given emergency powers under a crisis, will manufacture crises to continue and enlarge the breadth of that power. </p>
<p>If history has anything to offer, it's the sober knowledge that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Look at all the economic damage that's been done by these lockdowns, ask yourself, who benefits from so many millions of small and mid size businesses being forced to exit the market?</p>

        <p>I see your point, but it's not really related to my confusion. I still need someone to help me understand how this works on a global scale. If like several European countries started opening back up and not requiring masks/saying that masks don't work, that would <em>severely</em> damage the US' ability to perpetuate lockdowns and other measures, and vice versa. It's like they've all agreed not to do that, but again, how is such an agreement reached?</p>

<p>Edit for your post edit: ahhh. So you know nothing of economics as well, lovely. </p>
<p>Sure, let's tax the rich so it becomes prohibitively expensive to manufacture products in the US, forcing them to take those jobs overseas, and automate what little infrastructure their businesses had left in the US. Great idea. Total economic chad.</p>

        <p>The thing is... they've admitted the Tuskegee experiment was wrong and the scientific community learned from it and laws were created to prevent it happening again. I understand privately funded scientific research can be bias but this isn't coming from a single entity. Also, vaccines are state promoted but not created.</p>
<p>Honestly I doubt you would have believed cigarettes were bad for your health when doctors and scientists retracted their endorsements. Sure people were getting cancer and dying. But people are getting COVID and dying and you don't believe precautions need to be taken. So why take precautions and stop smoking?</p>
<p>And why would elected officials set out to kill or maim their populace and turn around and get the vaccine themselves? And why hasn't anyone with merit (aka not hidden keyboard warriors) speak out against this planned conspiracy?</p>

<p>Oh, they are.</p>
<p>They're being labeled misinformation, censored, and even jailed. Google doesn't allow anti mask/vaccine clinical studies show up in searches, and people like you cheer it on.</p>
<p>Hey man, if you want to recognize big pharma and the US government's shady collaborative history, then proceed to think the powers that be suddenly developed a moral compass right before publicly announcing certain people's livelihoods are more essential than others, go for it. I wont stop you, let me know how it goes trying to hold vaccine makers liable for any side effects you or your loved ones experience (hint, they're not liable at all).</p>

<p>My friend, you have much to learn about the governments disdain for its citizens. Much indeed.</p>

        <p>The study you reference is stating more studies need to be conducted before concluding masks work. That is how researchers and scientists operate. That article is a research article from 2015 to determine if more studies need to be conducted on a topic. It can lead to funding.</p>

        <p>My manager is fully against the masks, lockdowns, economic impacts, politization of a medical crisis, and a rushed vaccines, but he's on his second shot now. I ask why he got the jab. He said his wife badgered him to get it after she got hers. He stated:</p>
<p>"Happy wife. Happy life."</p>

        <p>Using government force to close someone's business isn't selfish? <br>
Arresting and fining people who gather in groups isn't selfish?<br>
Limiting peoples right to gather isn't selfish?   </p>
<p>Seems to me Jane, just wants to be left alone. Whereas John is forcing Jane to do things.</p>

        <p>the gorvernment using a law that was created for such situations to close businesses to keep people safe is not selfish. it’s running a country and I don’t know where you live but here they help the owners to get over that hump. </p>
<p>Gatherings are also regulated by that law for situations in which a virus is spreading fast and will be even more if Janes meet up and get other sick. </p>
<p>Jane would be left alone if she was just okay wearing a fuckin mask for 15mins in the grocery store without throwing a massive toddler tantrum as to why she just doesn’t want to and that John Is LiMiTiNg HeR RiGhTs...boohoo. </p>
<p>we are all in this shit together but Jane is ruining it all for us. THANKS!</p>

<p>Proper drug testing takes years. The only reason it has been "deemed safe" is because they passed emergency rules to bypass proper testing procedures. </p>
<p>The vaccine is an experimental therapy. If you want to get it go for it. I choose to decline.</p>

        <p>The regular traditional vaccines take years but this one uses a mRNA thing that doesn't use a weakened form of the virus like the traditional ones do. Plus, a bunch of people have taken the vaccine and not died. I agree to a point that long term effects can't have been tested in the 1 year the vaccine has been in development, but they have prediction tools to somewhat guesstimate what those effects will be and if they'll even happen</p>

        <p>I don't know what's going to happen because it hasn't gone through proper testing. And since I don't know I'm not taking it.</p>
<p>The vaccine may be perfectly safe, it may be lethal, it may cause birth defects in offspring. We don't know. And since we don't know, I'm not putting it in my body for a chance that it might prevent a virus which for my age group has an extremely low death rate.</p>

        <p>You're mistaken. It's been over a year and there have been no studies using real-world proof that mask-wearing reduces or controls spread.</p>
<p>Sure, we've all seen the cute videos of mist being emitted from a mannequin head, and some studies where everyone involved is in a health care setting, with standard PPE and trained in its proper use. However, none of them feature real people in real-world settings, wearing whatever they choose to slap across their face, moving their jaws, removing it to eat or speak to a hearing-impaired person -- things we all do every day.</p>
<p>It took the experts a year to advise double-masking, pretty much reinforcing our view that a little piece of random cloth is not protection. And if that cloth isn't effectively stopping virus from getting <strong>to</strong> your mouth and nose, it certainly isn't effectively stopping virus from coming <strong>from</strong> your mouth and nose.</p>

        <p>by just searching for 5 minutes I found one study using real-world proof in whole Canada: it's estimated that mask mandate has been responsible for a 25% drop on weekly covid cases. It's alsmo estimated that if mask mandate could have been adopted in July, the drop could have been up to 40% (link: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27891/w27891.pdf)</p>
<p>This article (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776536), among others, reference studies led in a real-world environment.</p>
<p>Of course in the real world if you remove your mask each time you speak to someone or eat with 30 people around you it's gonna reduce mask-policies' effectiveness, but it's not because of the masks, it's an human factor.</p>

        <p>The main issues I have with the whole Canada study is that it relies heavily on projections (as do most real-world studies), and that it studied the period from March to August. Mandates were in place everywhere in Canada after August, and compliance was high. By the end of August, the 7-day average of daily new cases hovered around 400 for the entire country. One month later, that rate almost quadrupled. And that was only the beginning.</p>
<p>The peaks that happened nearly everywhere in the fall and winter were essentially the same peaks regardless of NPIs mandated. It seems that the ability of cloth to effectively filter viral particles (or even the aerosols they travel upon) has been over-estimated. If a highly compliant country like Canada can do all the right things and get the same surge that less-compliant areas get, the methods being used to control the spread would seem to be suspect.</p>

<p>i guess it's a bit mean. it's just so weird how you people think you're rebels and free thinkers when the whole thing is predicated on not understanding how viruses work, the risks of new pathogens, and how the things you're most mad about are the inconsequential things (masks, hand hygeine)</p>
<p>you're 100% right to be skeptical of large changes made during quarantine periods -- historically they help states secure power -- but at the same time it's a literal war against a virus with long-term effects and that might mutate with any one transmission. the risks are high.</p>
<p>i'd champion you if you talked about worthy causes! fighting for privacy, making the government support businesses to reduce opening hours and keep people safer, or even the restructuring of old dinosaur institutions that are critically underfunded and becoming more and more out of sync with contemporary living (schools, banking, shipping-reliant produce and foods, car-commutes, etc)</p>
<p>but no, you're mad about masks -- something i think should be worn even for colds or subway rides  :/</p>

        <p>Who's mad about hand hygiene? I've been vigilant about that since before any of this began, and extra vigilant since it began. Not sure where that came from.</p>
<p>As for masks, I have no problem with people who are actually sick with COVID staying home, and if they must be around somebody for some reason, wearing a mask. But masking people who aren't sick, under the possibility they may be asymptomatic is the issue here that I, and most here take exception to, and historically, that's simply never been done. Which points to something other than common sense medical practice being at work here. </p>
<p>I've had COVID, so I understand its dangers both in the present, and also have experienced some nagging after-affects. It's not fun, not a joke, not made up, and not merely a "common cold" as I've seen some assert. The problem is, it affects everybody so differently, with some asymptomatic entirely, and others experiencing only mild cold-like or flu-like symptoms. Then there's those rare cases (and yes, statistically, they are very rare, especially for non-elderly populations) where it attacks much worse, or collaborates with a pre-existing condition, and it becomes a serious condition, even life threatening or fatal. </p>
<p>All that being said, however, you can't just shut down society over it, and it's clearly not on the scale of the bubonic plague, or even a mass ebola breakout. People should still be able to go about their lives as normal, with those most at risk taking precautions (like wearing masks if they so desire, or being quarantined if they are concerned about the risk), and the rest of us continuing as we did with the myriad of virus swirling around before 2020. THIS, is the correct way to handle this, not forcing those precautions on everybody, and shaming all those who won't comply with them.</p>

        <p>Thing is, masks were absolutely used during previous Sars (coronavirus) epidemics. But they were, like Ebola, deadlier and thus less transmissible. Imho, wearing a mask is good practice even for the sniffles. </p>
<p>But Covid is contagious before you’re symptomatic and it can take days for anything to show up. Not to mention it’s transmitted via particulates in the air, which is worse than droplets but not worse than airborne. This makes it a nightmare for prevention and control. </p>
<p>And, like I’ve said here and elsewhere, the mutation risks in each transmission are what’s scary. Trillions of these viruses replicating in a giant human Petri dish can get worse, with long lasting effects we simply cannot possess data to understand yet. </p>
<p>It’s basic prevention is better than cure. Having asymptomatic people wear masks as a standard rule, given the above, just overall reduces the risks. Like, condoms can’t prevent STIs or even a baby <em>all</em> the time, but you still wouldn’t go bareback. And if you’ve just met someone and they say they’ve had a vasectomy, you’d still want a condom because you simply do not know. </p>
<p>The less transmissions, the better. There was a time a little over a year ago when everyone was shrugging it off, saying China would manage to control it and it’s just “over there”. Arguably, a proper response would have been to shut down airports snd cruises for two weeks, and we might have been able to curb the pandemic. I mean, fuck, theoretically if everything and everyone could just stop for two weeks the virus is dead. But we can’t, we’ve had to keep working and doing shit. That means masks.</p>

        <p>See, I disagree with the notion that preventative action is required, or even responsible, when it comes to things that are only possibilities, and not realities. Masking everybody, because "possibly" they might have COVID and be asymptomatic is absurd to me, and to all of us in the sub, and millions of Americans. And it's because it is unprecedented. There simply isn't precedent for something on this scale, and looking back through history before this really got going, it was clear that masking was barely a thing. Of course, now that it's become the narrative, suddenly pictures from way back appear, but I can assure you, they were non-existent if you searched for them prior to March of 2020. It just wasn't a sensible proposition to treat everybody as having the disease, so it wasn't done then, and it shouldn't be done now. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, like I said above, the vast majority of people won't even experience anything to the level I did from COVID, which was bad, but not even the worst I've ever been sick. Shutting down society, and forcing people (again, I think anybody who wants to mask, is more than welcome to!) to mask is a clear overreaction to the actual threat and danger of the virus, no matter how many "cases", and how many inflated death numbers are thrown around due to highly generous ways of counting COVID deaths (that again, have never been done before when counting deaths from things.) </p>
<p>I'm old enough to remember when science, and every single Dr. said that herd immunity was real, but that's against the narrative now, so I guess we're just going to memory hole that too, and pretend it doesn't exist anymore! ;)</p>

        <p>&rt; Masking everybody, because "possibly" they might have COVID and be asymptomatic is absurd to me, and to all of us in the sub, and millions of Americans. </p>
<p>Why, though? It's only rational, since transmission happens <em>before</em> symptoms show. Putting a mask on only if you have symptoms <em>was</em> the starting position, but it proved completely ineffective -- closing barn doors after the horses have bolted. </p>
<p>&rt; There simply isn't precedent for something on this scale, and looking back through history before this really got going, it was clear that masking was barely a thing.</p>
<p>Masks were a thing even during the Spanish flu. But don't forget, pre 1900s doctors thought germs were 'silly'. </p>
<p>We've come a long way. We were maks in operating theatres. We know and can actually visualise how viruses spread and contaminate the air. <strong>We know.</strong> </p>
<p>&rt;but I can assure you, they were non-existent if you searched for them prior to March of 2020. It just wasn't a sensible proposition to treat everybody as having the disease, so it wasn't done then, and it shouldn't be done now.</p>
<p>I assure you it was? I mean, the principle of keeping the bad smells or 'miasma' out was the reason the plague doctor masks were made. We intuitively know it works, and now we have evidence for how and why. This belief that the images only existed after the fact is wild, to me, because to me they're iconic images. </p>
<p>&rt;At the end of the day, like I said above, the vast majority of people won't even experience anything to the level I did from COVID, which was bad, but not even the worst I've ever been sick. </p>
<p><em>As far as we know</em>, it's risky as hell. </p>

<p>Herd immunity is real... either with familiar diseases or vaccines. Our immune systems were not protecting against covid.</p>

<p>I was referring to mass masking. The common everyday person was not going around masked like that. People actively dealing with those that had the plague were. Again, that is consistent with the point I've been trying to make. </p>
<p>We'll just have to agree to disagree, because you'll never be able to convince me of a common sense rationale for treating everybody as asymptomatic carries of COVID. That is simply unreasonable, and doesn't follow any scienctific norms or precedent. I also think your fear of "risk" is just a lot higher than mine, which is pretty much nil. Life is full of risks every single day. I simply don't fear them, and I don't fear viruses, even COVID, especially not after having it.</p>

<p>Yes, when plagues are transmitted by touch, or droplets, or blood, masks are just prudent for contact. </p>
<p>This works differently. It's carried by particulates in the air, the kind we spew thousands of when talking. Because we know and understand this, we need to wear masks. This is the scientific norm. Let's not forget, there's the science of people's psychology. People, unless they're hypochondriacs, will insist they're fine if they have sniffles and go on to infect whoever the fuck. Solution? We can't have nice things, please wear your fucking mask. </p>
<p>This is straightforward, and consistent with <em>my point</em>.</p>

        <p>Here's the problem though: I systemically reject your point as simply an opinion, and a fallacious one at that. I don't say that in a mean way. But you're acting like your stating a gospel truth, or even a commonly accepted fact, and you're not. Millions, perhaps billions of people disagree with your assertion, including many Doctors, Scientists, and Virologists, as well "normal" people like you and I. I know many agree with you as well, in all of those categories. The difference however, is the people like me aren't trying to force our opinion on you, and you are trying to force yours on us, and saying rude ass things like "wear your fucking mask" (even if preceded with a please.) That's literally the quickest way to get me to not wear that fucking mask you want me to wear. Tact is always the best route, no matter the situation. </p>
<p>Again, we have dealt with viruses and diseases our entire lives, and they have been airborne, and we have endured. Many have gotten sick, almost all have recovered, and some, unfortunately have died. All that was before COVID in 2020. See any similarities? Cue Pam from The Office to say "It's the same picture", only on a slightly more deadly level. So people are taking this more seriously all around. But that doesn't mean masking everybody, all the time, including the asymptomatic ones, and I'll stand on that. It's literally how we've handled this before, and we've let life run its course, as we always do. Life is full of risk, and danger of death. That's simply the unalterable truth of it. You can choose to be fearful of life, when it introduces something more dangerous into the mix, but I, and many like me, choose not to.</p>

<p>It isn't opinion: we know how the virus spreads, and we know masks, distancing, and reducing time in shared spaces slows transmission, if not preventing it altogether. This is desirable because you absolutely don't want to run the risk of flooding hospitals with limited capacity for covid patient influxes. </p>
<p>Nothing there is opinion.</p>
<p>&rt; The difference however, is the people like me aren't trying to force our opinion on you, and you are trying to force yours on us, and saying rude ass things like "please wear your fucking mask"*</p>
<p>By not wearing your mask in public spaces, you are enforcing your opinion on others: and your spittle. That's the issue. We are connected by the air we share. Imagine if power companies said 'fuck it' to their converters and just doubled down on polluting the air with coal because it's an 'opinion', they're literally forcing their decision onto the surrounding area. </p>
<p>&rt;Again, we have dealt with viruses and diseases our entire lives, and they have been airborne, and we have endured.</p>
<p>Either they have vaccines, or we build up antibodies to them, or we have practices to prevent them. We don't just yolo it when it comes to dengue fever, yellow fever, cholera, malaria, etc. We have things to mitigate. We absolutely quarantined the fuck out of ebola zones in that outbreak, and had buildings for health care workers in Africa that allowed them to sterilise their entire suits before stripping down and hitting the showers. It was a 45 minute process, easily. That's how we endured, by taking the big steps to slow the spread. But it's too much to wear a piece of cloth when out in public? Really? </p>
<p>We don't 'just let life run its course'. The entire medical profession, the building of infrastructure, all exists to help people out. </p>
<p>&rt; Life is full of risk, and danger of death. That's simply the unalterable truth of it.</p>
<p>You obviously don't even wear a seatbelt. Maybe you take naps with a lit cigarette. Or make toast in the bathtub while using the bathtub. Iunno, fine, fuck it. But don't risk <em>other</em> people's lives by not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>I'm not 'fearful' of life, but I respect it. Same principle as with the sea. It takes insane conceit to think being dumb is the same as being 'brave'.</p>

<ol>
<li>The virus transmits</li>
<li>How masks and social distancing don't help. </li>

<p>&rt;The bottom line is that you used terrible, non-correlative analogies at the end of your post, and again stated an opinion as fact at the top. </p>
<p>No. Dangers are identified and given safety measures <em>all the time</em>. These aren't 'analogies', they're literally the same practice and example. Not wearing a mask is like drinking and driving, where you're likely to injure somoene as well as yourself. </p>
<p>&rt;Many Doctors and Scientists, as well as other highly intelligent people, disagree with what you claim is not opinion. But it is.</p>
<p>And they're all there, ready for you to summon and nod in agreement? And none of them are actually epidemiologists, public health experts, etc that actually are in charge. Weird. </p>
<p>Just some facts are all you'd need to change my mind. I know them, and would need to see things that directly contradict them to chuck masks in the 'maybe' pile. </p>

But the fact that you can't get it through your thick skull that trying to unnecessarily force masks on people who don't want them for a virus that simply does not demand that level of response, from every single tangible statistical indicator, means this entire thread is akin to a dog chasing a car for both of us. Just let it go man. I think you're a mindless lemming who isn't half as smart as you think you are, and has failed to successfully argue any of your points, in addition to making some naively absurd correlations. You think I'm pathetic, irresponsible, and dumb, endangering the lives of everybody I'm around when I'm not wearing your precious mask. So be it. I can live with that. Can you? If you can't you should figure out why some random person on the internet's opinion matters so much to you. Again, be well.</p>

        <p>Bravo for the attitude at least. </p>
<p>Doesn’t change that masks and distancing are the best thing at slowing transmission. Nothing in this sub says otherwise. </p>
<p>I don’t fancy myself a debater, but no one has made a single point about why wearing masks is legitimately bad and not just good hygiene and basic respect. At the end of the day, I’m the one referring to actual authorities here. Not figments to prop up what I say.</p>

        <p>My argument here all along hasn't been that "masks are bad for you" (although as somebody who has had lifelong breathing issues, I can't wear them for long periods at a time, so they do eventually affect me negatively, and in certain conditions like heat), though I know that is something that many in this community say, and feel strongly about. And they do have studies and research to back that up. </p>
<p>But that's not what my main point is. I'm disagreeing on the good hygiene and basic respect part, and I've enumerated why many times, so I'm not going over that again. Having said that, I actually do "respect" the mask rules in many cases currently, which has gotten me attacked by members of this very subreddit (the other protracted back and forth I'm in currently besides with you, is with some virulent anti-masker who attacked me for being respectful of businesses right to have people wear masks in their establishments. At work when people are around, I put the mask on out of respect for them (and because it's required when around people.) There are other examples as well, where I've put the mask on out of "respect." So even though I don't believe in it, and hate what I believe it to represent on a larger scale, I have still chosen to wear it at times out of courtesy to others. </p>
<p>Now, I still predominantly don't wear one, but I also go out of my way to avoid places requiring them, and won't kowtow to random people wanting me to wear one if we're outside, as to me that's peak idiocy to think a mask is at all necessary outside. A mask outside is just never happening for me. Because I DO follow the science.</p>
<p>I think the big difference between you and I is in your second to last sentence there. You give a lot more credence and respect to "authorities" than I do. In my life, I have one authorities. God. Outside of that, I am my only authority. There are plenty of "authority figures" that can make suggestions for what I should do, or even must do, but ultimately, I, and I alone will make the decision of what I do, in accordance to God's law's, not man's. So, your "actual authorities" are not my "actual authorities". and therein lies the rub. Your bosses aren't my boss. They may think they are, but they're not. Nor will they ever be. Any submitting to laws set forth by man is done under the decision of my own free will, in accordance to following God's direction to be respectful to all people whenever possible, including earthly authorities. Whenever possible, meaning, when it doesn't conflict with His Word, commands, or the conscience He's given me. </p>
<p>You probably think all that's crazy talk, and so be it. But don't forget, that following these principles, I've literally dedicated my entire life to serving the underprivileged, needy, disabled, and mentally ill in my community, and striving to better their lives. The "selfish asshole who doesn't care about others" tag doesn't fit on me, because I've proven for 23 years that's not even remotely true about me. My actions do my speaking for me in "real life", no matter what preconceptions you get about me from reddit. </p>
<p>At any rate, take care, be well, and God bless!</p>

        <p>Good on you for showing that respect to others though. It’s a basic gesture that shows you’re willing to take care of your neighbour, and it will. </p>
<p>I understand what you mean about authorities, but I’m not talking states — I have disagreed with a lot of the half measures and lopsided policies — I’m talking about public health experts that, based on their expertise, think so and so is good at slowing the spread. Ultimately, this virus really exposes how slow we have become to adapt to new circumstances and how  desperately we cling onto the familiar. </p>
<p>Bit of a detour:</p>
<p>The way schools are designed and organised is largely vestigial. Back when communities were smaller it’s where the kids that didn’t have to work were taught, and as they opened up to more and more kids they often kept ratios of 1 teacher for every 25-35 kids. The biggest differences from 1930 to today? More standardised testing, more focus on clerical tasks for middle management style jobs like accounting, more paperwork and bureaucracy, the introduction of multimedia. Oh, and less funded. </p>
<p>It’s become slower, less desirable for teachers, and far too systematic for kids who feel in any way slower than their peers. As if teachers manage to build rapport and bonds with students despite circumstances, and not by design. </p>
<p>Now Covid hits and we’re absolutely adamant there was nothing wrong with all this as we cannot practice social distancing for classrooms, managing 20+ kids on zoom is nigh impossible, support and social networks for kids are nonexistent as they’re stuck at home or forced to go out, and utilities like the internet are priced out for kids from poorer backgrounds. There’s no discussion where there should be discussion about “What are we doing wrong with schools? How can we make them better?” We just want to desperately keep it as it was, uncritically.</p>

        <p>Interesting detour. I agree with pretty much everything you've said. I think the school system is a mess right now, and really, there are no easy solutions. If they were ever going to overhaul it, now would be the time, I guess. I know my own kids' experience in school has been quite varied, in spite of them all going to the same one. Clearly, not all kids are going to be able to extract the same amount of learning from the same environment. Smaller classrooms are probably a good start, but then you're looking at needing more teachers. Is that plausible? Will supply meet the demand? </p>
<p>And now the virtual schooling comes along with COVID, and while it may work well with the HS kids like my oldest two children, my 7 year old is floundering in it, because it's just a difficult setup to maintain attention, and really convey the required concepts needed for learning at that age. So some kids benefit, but others suffer. It's going to be interesting to see what shakes out of all this mess, but without changes being made, it probably won't be great.</p>

        <p>I think, unfortunately, no sufficient changes will be made. Government won’t prioritise funding education and giving teachers better salaries and reasons to be educated beyond the bare minimum. Schools won’t reduce the middle management style burdens of what are essentially KPIs and project proposals that make a narrow road for schools when they should be deep pools we come out of better and capable of swimming. </p>
<p>Similar things can be said for businesses that have often prioritised looking busy and filling out time in the office to “justify” salaries rather than making it about tasks and really using tech to let us be able to work from home when we need to and when our kids need it. </p>
<p>I deeply, deeply miss indoor spaces like bars and cafes and theatres and museums. I don’t think there are alternatives to those, because they’re built on activities we like and not systems of institution. </p>
<p>But there’s room for redesigning how other aspects of leisure work, but they won’t happen. Stuff like having smaller farms with better practices be closer to the restaurants and communities they serve or being more seasonal with food and lessening demand. It’s been hell for farms to find the normal amount of workers they’re used to. </p>
<p>Frankly, wearing a mask in spaces that aren’t mine is just the least I feel like we could be doing.</p>

        <p>Do you not live in a place that has theaters open? I've been going to theaters again for a couple of months now, as it's one of my favorite activities. At mine, people just have to wear masks throughout the lobby, and to their seats. Once seated, they can take them off. Or does that make you nervous too? </p>
<p>I don't think I've been to a bar in a while, as that's not really my scene, but I've gone to many restaurants. Are they not open where you are either?</p>

        <p>Nah we were recently fucked numbers wise. Last time I managed cinema theatres was December. Compared to last year where is go to the cinema 4 times a month sometimes — 5 rarely. </p>
<p>I’m altogether not that nervous if I can maintain distances. Public transport has been the worst thing, particularly in winters when people are averse to open windows... haven’t bothered with restaurants or cafes because honestly relaxing I. The chairs and having big laughs and talking to strangers is the best part. </p>
<p>Galleries are overall fine, if not better with restricted numbers and being overall calmer, at least. But anything to do with performance .. no.</p>

        <p>You wearing a mask doesn't just make ME safe. It makes every person near at any point during the day safe. It doesn't just protect me. It protects dozens or hundreds of people.</p>
<p>It shows how incredibly self-centered you are that you think that way. I'm not just worried about me. I'm worried about ALL of us. The people you're shopping near, the cashier, the people you work with, the customers, whoever. You're not just helping me by wearing a mask. You're helping all of them.</p>
<p>Putting up with a little personal discomfort to help many people is obviously not selfish.</p>
<p>Taking absolutely no consideration for the health or well-being of others because it would be mildly inconvenient for you is WILDLY selfish. It's disgusting how you have to twist yourself, to twist reality to save your ego. You can't accept what a selfish person you are.</p>

        <p>&rt; It shows how incredibly self-centered you are</p>
<p>this is human nature. you are no different. you try to impose your views on others.
I on the other hand leave you alone.</p>
<p>&rt; I'm worried about ALL of us.</p>
<p>I can take care of myself. its no one elses reponsibility.<br>
accidentially infecting someone with a deseas happened in the past. it will happen in the future. its happening right now.<br>
nothing to worry about and no reason to fundamentally change social interactions. don't be a dick, stay home when your sick, done.</p>
<p>&rt; Putting up with a little personal discomfort</p>
<p>good. from now on, you will only ride your bike. EVERYWHERE. no more car. this will help everyone else too for just a minor inconvenience for you.</p>
<p>&rt; Taking absolutely no consideration for the health or well-being of others</p>
<p>wrong again. I do take it into consideration.<br>
I simply come to a different conclusion than you.<br>
if you are afraid of the virus, stay away from people. done.<br>
for those VERY FEW who can not do that. well, thats life.<br>
still no reason to massively (its not mildly by any means anymore) inconvenience others.</p>
<p>&rt; twist reality to save your ego</p>
<p>you were the one calling others selfish. its frustrating if someone shoves a mirror in your face, I get it.</p>
<p>&rt; You can't accept what a selfish person you are.</p>
<p>oh I accept me alright. I accept that I never took a vaccine for someone elses sake. neither will I now.<br>
I never stopped going by car and accepted that I may kill someone in an accident.  </p>
<p>the only reason you are being a virtue signalling piece of shit right now is because it became fashionable.<br>
get real.</p>
<p>the only thing I am truely worried about at the moment is the future of the kids and their mental health.<br>
they need our proctetion. and we are failing them completely.<br>
adults can and should take care of themselves. some may not be able too and thats just bad luck then. thats life.  <br>
politics should be made for the greater good of everone and not just a selected few.</p>

        <p>How’s it feel to live in fear and literally need force everybody else to behave “properly” in order for you to be okay? (by “behave properly”, I mean breathe freely and touch other humans). How’s the anxiety going? The depression? The helplessness? Hopelessness?

        <p>Well, all actual science in the world is against you. So it's weird that you're just pretending that it's on your side. Every major medical body around the world says you're wrong. But I'm sure you know a handful of "doctors" on Twitter with degrees from some unheard of diploma mill that support your view.</p>
<p>"Obey the government." So you never do anything that any government body advises? Because that's "obeying"? You don't pay taxes or vote or fill out the census or anything like that? All you're saying is that listening to the government in any way is "obeying" and that's wrong. So the government is wrong about everything all the time? If you think they're specifically wrong about Covid, you should explain WHY. Who said what? Why was that wrong? "Anybody who listens to the government at all is a little bitch" is just fucking stupid on its face.</p>
<p>"What your TV tells you." Again. Same thing. Everything all TV says is wrong? You never listen to anything anyone on TV says?</p>
<p>You're just making very vague "you're stupid for listening to anybody" remarks. So... where are you getting your information? All governments are wrong. Everyone on TV is wrong. Who is speaking the truth and what makes you think they're right? And what's to stop me from making equally vague judgments of them? "Ha, if you really want to be a small-brained loser and listen to X, heh, sure." You could literally make your arguments about anyone or anything. "Heh, you're dumb enough to listen to them, huh?" Wow, how insightful.</p>

        <p>Cops randomly walking up to guys sitting alone on the beach was during a protest? You're lying and scapegoating. And yeah I agree cops suck pretty much worldwide. Also I don't know where you're getting your news from but 6,000 plus local cases a day is just a flat out lie again. Nobody's getting infected with covid like that the TV just keeps telling you that they are getting infected like that because they are experiencing freedom. The TV is trying to snuff out the freedom not the virus 😘</p>

<p>"People obeying the police out of fear of getting their skulls cracked? Yeah obviously the cases are going down because they don't want to get their skulls cracked, (hint hint nudge nudge) do as we say or we crack your fuckin skull"</p>

        <p>Numbers are from Florida govt. I guess we have to agree to disagree, maybe no lockdown and restrictions have worked in Florida but not everywhere. 
Same with lockdown and restrictions, it hasn't worked everywhere but in Australia, it's one of the few places where it has and we are basically back to normal life for a while now.</p>

        <p>Oh shit so all you had to do was suffer through complete totalitarian government for a couple of months and then that totalitarian government graciously allows you to continue living your life so long as you're willing to submit in the future so that great totalitarian government? Wow Australia must be a fucking Paradise I guess huh? Next thing you'll tell me is that a group of guys showed up to rape your wife, and as long as you just let them rape your wife you can have her back after. Cuz that's just safety...</p>

<p>That's the plan.  After "prison reform" empties the prisons they'll want to fill that empty space with "domestic terrorists" such as yourself.</p>

        <p>If John doesn't want to die, then it's on John and only John to take care of himself. He can wear a mask, stay away from people, or get a vaccine.</p>
<p>No one has the right to virus-free or low virus interactions with other humans. We never had that right. Only in the last year have people invented these absurd, impossible, "No virus" rights. Viruses and bacteria have been part of the human biome for millions of years. We assume the risk of germ spread when we interact with another organism. It's always been that way. And it always will. Thinking we can live in a world without viral spread is the epitome of being anti-science and the pinnacle of being a control freak. Especially now that we have large scale vaccine rollout to the general population. </p>
<p>We have the right to stay home if we don't like germs. We have the right to wear a hazmat suit or mask. We have the right to keep a certain distance from others. But that's about it. We don't have the right to destroy someone's income, future, and livelihood, because we are afraid.</p>
<p>So yes, it is extremely selfish to demand that that others take action, because you are afraid.</p>

        <p>So ignore mask and isolation examples throughout history? You sound like someone who’d neglect to blackout their windows during the bombing of London, or who drives under the influence or refuses to use blinkers or wear a seatbelt. You do sound extremely selfish, and you’ve made it clear you know little of science or history, yet is full of ignorant self importance.  It’s amazing how brainwashed Trump and the enemies of America have made you, feeding you lies that taste good.</p>

        <p>When you associate following Trump with the belief that lockdowns and masks don't work, you are showing clearly how brainwashed you are. If you can't see with your own eyes and think with your own brain, don't bother coming to this sub to make a fool of yourself. Go talk to other people who's identity is based on what side of the political spectrum they lean, because that's where you'll get your congrats for being virtuous and your fake internet points.</p>

        <p>&rt; So ignore mask and isolation examples throughout history?</p>
<p>Are you talking about the relatively small groups of people who wore masks (which were proven ineffective) during the much deadlier Spanish Flu a hundred years ago?  Or are you talking about the literally Medieval practice of quarantining plague carriers, which also didn't work?</p>

        <p>Nah, I keep them away from the misinformation swamps like reddit, and the MSM, so they actually know the truth. As for disease, you do know it existed everywhere before 2020, right? I mean, disease being everywhere is nothing new. The only new disease is this irrational fear of COVID. That's truly dangerous.</p>

<p>But yet I knew 10 people from 16-25 who have ended their lives over the governments overreach. I'm going back to normal, because your "New Normal" is killing people. Your mindset is the most infectious and deadly part of this virus.</p>

        <p>John doesn't want to die from Heart Disease, so he exercises to the point of heat stroke, and doesn't eat more than one meal a day. Jane realizes that while heart disease is an issue for some, it's not for her because she works out regularly, and keeps a healthy balance between unhealthy food, and unhealthy food. There. A better analogy for you.</p>

        <p>Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.</p>
