    <strong>I'm just so tired of everything relating to mask mandates</strong>
    <p><p>I'm honestly not sure what to do right now. I go to college in Massachusetts, and I'm about to start my junior year. The pandemic started in the middle of my freshman year, so I've basically spent a year and a half taking online classes instead. I was ready to finally go back to in-person learning after getting vaccinated because I hate having to wear masks and I generally want to make friends in school.   </p>
<p>Then the CDC announced vaccinated people still had to wear masks a couple weeks ago, and I recently got an email from my school's president hinting at an announcement this week regarding the use of masks, vaccination, and COVID tests, hinting we may have to go back to wearing masks   </p>
<p>Every student at my college was required to get the vaccine in order to enroll this year. Even though I live in a state that has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, and actual deaths from COVID are at an all-time low, my school might go back to forcing us to start wearing masks again.   </p>
<p>I am just done with the cowards who are afraid of a virus that hasn't even touched a huge chunk of college students all because of some new variant that BARELY AFFECTS THE VACCINATED. And several students in my school's community app are like "blame the unvaccinated", or "masks aren't that bad", or "you're saving lives", or "anything to get back to in-person learning". That's not my problem with the mask mandates.   </p>
<p>If you still want to wear masks to feel safe, that's fine. If you don't want to get the vaccine because you don't feel safe taking it, that's fine. I don't want anyone to feel like they're being forced to do anything, whether it's related to masks or getting vaccinated, and I'm tired of the government policing everyone in the name of "science". Said "science" keeps being changed for no reason other than the guy in charge of taking care of the virus in America everyone seems to worship no matter what he does.   </p>
<p>I'm considering taking a semester off in protest of the mask mandate should that be true, but I'm not sure how else to make my voice heard. I live in one of the most blue states in the country, and it seems like everyone I know, even my parents, is just going to go along with the new mask mandate across the state despite how better off we are compared to the rest of the state. How exactly do you even protest something like this when it feels like there's nobody else to actually help you with this?   </p>
<p>I'm sorry for how long this is. I just want to do something about these stupid mask mandates for once after wasting almost two years of my life listening to the government</p></p>

        <p>The clipping point for you is having to wear a mask again? It wasn’t being coerced to inject yourself with something before you were allowed to move on with your life? </p>
<p>Priorities these days… mind boggling.</p>

        <p>That’s the problem with people these days; you seem to think the government grants you freedom and rights. You were born with inalienable rights and they cannot be restrained or repealed by human law. If you make exceptions to this fact then you welcome in with open arms the evil that comes with it.</p>
<p>I do, sincerely, wish you the best though.</p>

        <p>In Mass as well.  I feel horrible for all of you kids, my son included.  Do you have others who feel the same way?  Maybe some massive civil disobedience is in order...meaning just don’t comply to masks. </p>
<p>However, there are consequences.  Don’t know your situation or how far you could take this.</p>
<p>Good luck.  We’re all in the same boat.</p>

        <p>This will be an unpopular prediction here but I’m relatively certain we are going to be plunged into horrible lockdowns again especially if you are in a blue state. The language they are using and the things they are saying is priming us for this. You are in a blue state, you will be affected by this. If I’m wrong I would be happy to be wrong but I’m pretty sure this is coming. People need to stock up on basic things right now because even though they’re technically won’t be shortages ...shortages will be created by people panicking just like before and with supply chain issues. You may not even have in person School even though it looks like you will right now.</p>
