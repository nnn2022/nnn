    <p><p>They do realise that they screwed themselves with the whole "2 weeks" thing right? Just give up a little bit of freedom for 2 weeks and everything will be fine...</p>
<p>I mean...they know we'll throw that in their face every opportunity right? Any time they talk about some "temporary measure" will be countered with "ya, just like 2 weeks to flatten the curve".</p>
<p>They're done with anything temporary. I just read that they plan on allowing inflation to go out of control "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/business/economy/christopher-waller-inflation.html">temporarily</a>".</p>
<p>ya...just like 2 weeks to flatten the curve...we'll have inflation for years.  </p>
<p>They're done with "temporary" anything.</p></p>

        <p>The question is do they give a fuck? 
How much shit have politicians done that negatively affect the people they serve, to either forward an agenda or fill their own pockets. They will continue to be self serving until the people put their foot down. We need to hold politicians to their oaths. Either that or have a good old fashion French revolution. I would rather settle this peaceful, sadly people usually dont give up power peacefully. POWER TO THE PEOPLE.</p>
