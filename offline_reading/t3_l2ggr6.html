    <strong>It’s rushed, un(der)tested, not a vaccine and it’s here...top reasons to be concerned about the experimental mRNA treatments currently being rolled out in what can only be considered the global field trials.</strong>
    <p><p>Of all the threats we’re facing right now, I consider the mRNA “vaccine” to be the most pressing and immediate:</p>
<p>10) Threats to fertility via spike protein effects on the placenta. Pharma can’t allay these fears, and are open (in their documentation, at least) about their ignorance on this matter. They’ve recently back-pedalled on discouraging pregnant women and women hoping to become pregnant from taking it though. Below you will see the discrepancy between information given to patients and doctors on this issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k7tkri/compare_the_uk_governments_information_pack_for/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k7tkri/compare_the_uk_governments_information_pack_for/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://mattbell.org/mrna-vaccine-blocks-protein-that-helps-formation-of-human-placenta">https://mattbell.org/mrna-vaccine-blocks-protein-that-helps-formation-of-human-placenta</a></p>
<p>9) Antibody-dependent enhancement or pathogenic priming - another unproven yet undebunked threat. Does the “vaccine” create a greater threat to the immune system from contact from the wild virus? In the FDA documents, “vaccine enhanced disease” is listed as a possible outcome. (See below). The skipped animal trials might have highlighted this issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12725690/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12725690/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEdVZcp7Lbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEdVZcp7Lbc</a></p>
<p>8) The worrying outcomes in Australia, whereby guinea pigs/ cannon fodder somehow tested positive for HIV. MSM claims these are false positives, but it does play into fears of autoimmune disasters predicted in FDA’s/ Pfizer’s own documents.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-55269381">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-55269381</a></p>
<p>7) Bell’s Palsy - cases of this appearing globally. Reported initially by the MSM as temporary (worrying enough) but predictably never followed up by the MSM. How do we know?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9030943/Four-volunteers-got-Pfizers-vaccine-developed-Bells-palsy.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9030943/Four-volunteers-got-Pfizers-vaccine-developed-Bells-palsy.html</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-doctors-warn-against-2nd-vaccine-dose-for-those-who-suffer-bells-palsy-side-effect/">https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-doctors-warn-against-2nd-vaccine-dose-for-those-who-suffer-bells-palsy-side-effect/</a></p>
<p>6) Possible permanent, unresearched and unpredictable modifications on human DNA. However much we hear in the MSM that it doesn’t and can’t affect DNA, many doctors claim otherwise. Changes to RNA messaging for DNA sounds to me like it will have a definite effect.</p>
<p>5) The allergic reactions that started immediately. Aren’t all adverse reactions considered “allergic”? Aren’t all adverse reactions “significant”? Subjects with allergies were being told to hold off from having the “vaccine”. Think those proposed delays have now been removed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/breaking-people-who-suffer-significant-23139049">https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/breaking-people-who-suffer-significant-23139049</a></p>
<p>4) It’s meagre months of trial testing on exclusively youngish and healthy subjects, cannot tell us anything of the safety and efficacy on the elderly and the vulnerable (yet they’re the first to receive it)</p>
<p>3) The almost half of medical professionals who are refusing to take it</p>
<p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/12/12/nearly-half-of-care-home-staff-may-refuse-to-take-covid-vaccine-13743538/">https://metro.co.uk/2020/12/12/nearly-half-of-care-home-staff-may-refuse-to-take-covid-vaccine-13743538/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/2021/jan/15/half-caregivers-refusing-covid-19-vaccine/">https://www.kpbs.org/news/2021/jan/15/half-caregivers-refusing-covid-19-vaccine/</a></p>
<p>2) The long term effects which NOONE can predict or debunk, due to the insane, headlong rush to “save us” from this “pandemic”. “No time to test, just get it out there“ is apparently the mantra (though I suspect they have been testing these experimental treatments privately for decades...)</p>
<ol>
<li>The deaths throughout the world already. Hundreds already reported but, with the reticence of patients and doctors to report the findings, it’s highly likely to already be significantly higher. That number will of course only rise.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-16/norway-vaccine-fatalities-among-people-75-and-older-rise-to-29">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-16/norway-vaccine-fatalities-among-people-75-and-older-rise-to-29</a></p>
<p>Many more I’ve missed. Please leave them in the comments...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download</a></p>
<p>Second bonus: The “authorities” have been very clear that it is only designed to reduce symptoms and not transmission. Masks, social distancing and lockdowns will continue nonetheless, so why bother for a virus with an over 99% recovery rate?</p>
<p>Third bonus:</p>
<p>The fact that we’ll need 2 doses and the cavalier recommendation (in the U.K. at least) that you can mix and match the treatments from different companies to ensure you get both does not promote confidence...</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine doesn't prevent transmission of covid.  It prevents <em>symptoms</em> of covid.</p>
<p>In other words, you'll still have to wear a mask and do social distancing.  So what is the reason for getting a barely tested experimental vaccine?</p>

        <p>Their claim "95%", is certainly misleading.  </p>
<p>The "95%" here refers to treating <em>symptoms</em> of covid.  </p>
<p>There are many other treatments which help to reduce the symptoms of covid.  Vitamin D for example.  Which is much safer, and a lot less invasive.</p>

        <p>I guess by virtue of preventing symptoms, the spread would be prevented as well. Didn’t we find that asymptomatic people don’t spread the virus?</p>

        <p>They keep going back and forth about the asymptomatic spread.</p>
<p>If people could pass the virus that easily asymptomatically, it means the virus will eventually become endemic.  There are many viruses out there like that.  Staphylococcus for example.</p>
<p>If a virus is endemic (ubiquitous), it means it is more benign (the two define each other).  </p>
<p>In other words, asymptomatic spread if it is a thing, is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The threat of asymptomatic spread is a lie created by the pharmaceutical industry to force a vaccine on to the population.</p>
