    <strong>Does anyone have any insight into lockdown/mask restrictions in WV, New England?</strong>
    <p><p>What’s the lockdown/mask situations in West Virginia and New England like? Thinking of possibly moving to either from my current liberal, strict lockdown/mask state.</p></p>

        <p>I'm up in Maine at the moment. Democratic Governor (Queen) Mills recently passed a mandate forcing everyone to wear a mask at all times indoors or outdoors, regardless of distancing capabilities. That said, fewer and fewer people give a shit about this virus the further and further north you head, so that's a plus.</p>
<p>Heard Mass is a mess, I imagine Rhode Island and Connecticut are in the same boat, as they typically are. Vermont is also shit from what I've been hearing.</p>
<p>New Hampshire would be your best bet, I'd say. Over the summer, I drove all over the state for job interviews. No one gives a shit, seriously - city, countryside, doesn't matter. Some businesses will act like they care and mildly encourage/enforce governmental recommendations (masks, distancing, etc.) but that's it. I went to this town between Maine and Mass and it was awesome. Totally packed, barely anyone with a mask, several live bands, and absolutely packed bars with no distancing. Republican governor also.</p>
<p>Can't say I know too much about West Virginia's state of affairs, but I do know that it's the most conservative state in the nation. I imagine not too many people would be following and/or enforcing their mask mandate.</p>
<p>A heads up though, sometimes you'll hear about a state not having a mask mandate. And sure, that'll be true. But I've found that many (MANY) times, individual counties/cities will have their own mask mandates in place, even though it's not technically required.</p>

        <p>New England is very mask oppressive right now. It is still possible to go maskless but it is also still legal to open carry in some NE states. WV might be a better option at this point, I can’t speak to WV.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this insight. I’ll continue to look into WV, another commenter said there’s still a mask mandate in place but overall seems not as well-enforced or serious as other states. Hope that’s true. Thanks again.</p>

        <p>In RI and when it comes to indoor masks it's pretty strict. They'll shut buisnesses down over it. Lately like 90% have been wearing them outside, but you don't have to. They don't want gatherings right now, but they don't enforce it. When we had a stay at home order it wasn't enforced. Even if you got a fine (have not heard of anyone actually getting one) it won't hold up in court. I think it's the same in MA and CT too (I think they're more strict) but not totally sure.</p>
<p>It sucks here right now, but it's not the worst I guess.</p>

        <p>I would have said New Hampshire is an exception until they issued a mask mandate last week, though it's not as insane as the one in Massachusetts, nor are the people. If you're looking for freedom, I wouldn't look at New England or anywhere northeast of, well, anywhere that's north and east. Basically take the map and lop off the top 1/4.</p>

        <p>It’s cool, dude. WV isn’t the worst, but they’re definitely starting to fall in line. My hometown has allegedly been hit hard. It’s a small shit town with absolutely nothing to do, so I have no idea how the hell it could be any worse than Morgantown or Charleston. Southern WV just dgaf, though. And it’s great. I was down that way over the summer and not a single soul was wearing a mask.</p>
