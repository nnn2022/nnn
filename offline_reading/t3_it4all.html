    <strong>Any group or website for Lockdown Victims?</strong>
    <p><p>Lockdown Victims are not legally silenced but many are not sharing or unable to share their stories because they don't have a place to share. Step forward and do anything like form a group or website (even a subreddit is fine) to help lockdown victims share their stories and give them support. I am only a teenager so this is something I cannot do but I am sure someone here can.</p>
<p>If you are not aware of who the victims are? They are basically anyone directly affected by lockdowns with issues such as delayed treatment, depression, PTSD and other mental health issues, physical health issues, abuse as well as those who died of suicide, delayed treatments etc which was directly caused by lockdown.</p>
<p>If you know of a group for lockdown victims or if you created one please link it in the comments. Note that I will only join a group if I can have anonymous identity and if I feel like it because I stick around on reddit anyway.</p></p>
