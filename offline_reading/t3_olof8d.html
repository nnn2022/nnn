    <strong>Shamed by my doctor for refusing jab as a healthy 22 year old…</strong>
    <p><p>Happened a few weeks ago but I can’t stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>Context: I am a fit 22 year old woman who has never had any health complications whatsoever. I also happen to work in a long-term care facility with mostly elderly and/or immunocompromised patients.</p>
<p>About two weeks ago I had a general doctors appointment scheduled but had a bit of a cough from a week of brutal allergies (accumulation of post nasal drip, ya know?). I knew I didn’t have anything serious but as I’m in Canada where everyone and everything is on the fringe of total insanity, I called the office to let them know and asked if they’d prefer we do it over the phone. Secretary responds “You did get your vaccine though, right?”. No ma’am. </p>
<p>My doctor calls me for our appointment and the first thing she says to me, without even a basic hello, is “My secretary says you didn’t get any of your doses yet. Do you want to talk about it?” To which I respond no I don’t want to discuss it, I’m 100% decided, I don’t want to get the jab because I’m a healthy 22 year old with virtually no risk of serious (or any) consequences from COVID. Dr. Pharma then goes on a spiel that went like this:</p>
<p>“Did you know that one 19 year old in Quebec died from COVID?” </p>
<p>“You you work with patients who are high-risk, if you bring the virus into the centre you can kill them, you wouldn’t want that would you?”</p>
<p>I pointed out to her that one young person dying from COVID is not comparable to the numerous reports of serious health complications (and mysterious deaths) related to the experimental vaccine. The way she tried to shame me was laughable, but I knew there was nothing I could say when she blatantly lied in response to my retort, saying “not one person has died because of the vaccine, it’s perfectly safe and you should stop listening to conspiracies”.</p>
<p>This is my trusted long-term medical professional. This person is supposed to advise me on the best course of action to maintain my health and well-being. Instead, she lied to me about well-reported facts, emphasized fear, and tried to shame me into partaking in an unapproved, experimental, dangerous medical trial. </p>
<p>Almost every day since then I’ve been driving myself mad thinking of all of the things I could have argued.</p>
<p>IF THE VACCINE WORKS, WHY DO I NEED TO TAKE IT TO PROTECT ALL OF THE FULLY VACCINATED PATIENTS? </p>
<p>I know there is no way I can change her mind, she's an experienced doctor. She has all the tools available at her disposal to properly educate herself and inform her patients properly. How did this happen? How did we get here? How many other patients is she utterly misinforming and misleading to convince them to get the jab? Is she a puppet for Big Pharma, simply ignorant, or has she really been brainwashed by this psy-op like so many others?</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel so hopeless, lonely, and like I'm going insane. None of what's happened in the past year has made any sense to me and this event really hit home the fact that some facets of reality of The Great Before may simply be irreparably broken. I will never trust The Experts, Medical Professionals, Scientists, The News Media, or Big Daddy Government ever again. </p>
<p>This community truly keeps me grounded, so thank you for continuing to share your experiences and opinions. It gives me hope to know that there are so many of us going through similar horrors. Stay frosty and keep fighting, there are more of us than they want you to think.</p>
<p>Edit to answer FAQ’s:
“Just change doctors!” That’s not how it works in Canada, especially not my province. Took me years to get this one, and I mostly use her for referrals and loosely prescribed meds.</p>
<p>“Report her to the board, get her fired!” Not to be defeatist, but I assume this was pushed directly by her board. I will look into it though.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to get annual check ups, it’s all a money-grab, big pharma, etc.” I had a work accident and need to see her a bunch for follow-ups and referrals. It’s an insurance ting. Yes, I’m not even at work and I’m a risk for killing my patients. </p>
<p>“You are a horrible, disgusting monster. You are directly killing our most vulnerable.” You’re right, I simply hate old people and want to eat your grandmas soul. </p>
<p>To be clear, I follow all health and safety protocol to a T. When I am working, I get tested 3x/week, I wear my N95 along with the rest of my head-to-toe PPE. I disinfect til my hands bleed. I know I work with vulnerable people and I respect that. I love my patients, and I love working in health care. That being said, my rights are important and should be respected as well. There is no way I will ever jeopardize my own well-being to feel a false sense of security in protecting my patients. If I got vaccinated I can still, JUST AS EASILY, transmit the virus into my centre. Feel free to riddle me that one.</p></p>

        <p>You should really check the wait times.  A few years ago, there was a hospital in Ontario that had a 3.5year wait for cataract surgery.  A friend of mine had angioplasty done, he waited 7 months.  I've been waiting 19 months to get into a new pain clinic.  You <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/wait-times-ontario">can check ontario's here</a> but I'm gonna add something.</p>
<p>One of my sisters had to have an "emergency" hysterectomy after her second kid, because when she had her first post-pregnancy period she nearly bled to death.  The hospital tried to send her home after she had lost nearly 2 quarts of blood.  It was still months before she got that surgery, it was classed as a "level 2 medical emergency" meaning the wait should not be more than 14 days.</p>
<p>Welcome to Canada.</p>

        <p>I know it was a joke, in Canada it's not a joke, especially in parts of the country.  Head to Northern Alberta/Ontario/SK/MB, where there's hospitals, you'll quickly find out that if you don't book at least 10-12 months in advance via your doctor, you likely won't get a room.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I told my husband we don’t have a family doctor (we recently moved Canada, he is candian I’m South African) he told me it does not work the same as in Africa, you can’t find a doctor you like and make an appointment, you told who you can see and who not. I’m still looking for a private family doctor,he said it would expensive but I feel more comfortable doing it this way.</p>

        <p>I disagree. HPV screening is a reason to be seen at her age. Women should definitely be seen at this age. Also, we don’t know her family history or if there is any other reason she should be followed by her regular doctor. If you want to make the most concise point then you should really drop the “zero reason” to be seen by a doctor perspective. I’m only saying this to try to help you in future arguments/discussions. Trust me, I’m visiting this sub for a reason.</p>

        <p>We made the mistake of letting doctors think they are gods. They've gotten away with accidentally killing people for years. They are also sanctioned if they don't follow the dogma their employers want. So, the few good ones can't speak out unless they are independently wealthy or have another income stream. Fauci, FDA, and the CDC are also to blame.</p>

<p>She gets paid more from MSP or whatever your province has when she can check the "Patient consult: Covid-19" box on the billing form. Hell, she probably did that because it was an over the phone consult.</p>
<p>So pushing it to everyone and anyone is how she makes more money. </p>
<p>Also, get a new doctor that isn't Crazy eyed Karen, she's supposed to listen to your concerns and provide a best path solution to medical issues, not lecture you like a fucking child and try to scare you into doing things.</p>

        <p>Depending where you live in Canada (I’m in Ontario) she probably couldn’t speak poorly about the vaccine even if she wanted to. Dr’s who speak up are being threatened with their careers for speaking up about the risks. All the more reason to NOT trust the vaccine or advice from them ( which is not only really sad but dangerous that we can’t trust them for their unbiased opinion)</p>

        <p>This doctor is actually researching what's going on and trying to do something. Instead of just blindly trusting what the government and big pharma tell them. He has discovered extremely clear evidence of widespread blood clots in people who took the vaccine. He literally just did the "science" himself and discovered something bad. I respect him as a doctor way more than the ones who did nothing and ignored their patients telling them they had weird side effects from the vaccine.</p>

        <p>More doctors are stepping forward in Canada to speak against the “vaccines” and corruption.</p>
<p><strong>EXPOSED - The Persecution of Canadian Physicians by Organized Medicine During the Pandemic</strong>
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GpViJcdJFkc&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Charles Hoffe has been serving patients for 28 years, many of them First Nations people in Lytton, BC</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Hoffe states the experimental Moderna ‘vaccines’ are injuring his patients.</p>
<p>Video link: https://hive.blog/hive-110786/@drutter/sjbdolck</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“I just said with all these side effects appearing shouldn’t we perhaps just pause things for a while. Anyway, within 48 hours I had a very stern rebuke from my superiors at the Internal Health Authority,</strong> who told me that I was guilty of causing ‘vaccine hesitancy’ and they were going to be reporting me to the college of physicians and surgeons in B.C., and that <strong>I was forbidden from saying anything negative about the vaccine within our health facility. So I had been given a gag order.</strong> So initially I was a bit intimidated, because you know, unfortunately many doctors are because <strong>the colleges hold tremendous authority to literally shut down your livelihood or to give enormous fines.</strong> So I was a bit intimidated but as the week went on and <strong>I saw more and more people coming into my office with serious neurological problems,</strong> following their,… and this was just the first shot of the (Moderna) vaccine and we know that the second one gives much worse side effects. I became more and more angry about my gag order.”
^(3:30-4:35)</p>
<p>&rt;”So <strong>what I’m telling people about is not some theory, this is what I have seen in my own patients. I’ve been a doctor to these patients for 28 years and now three of them are disabled by this first (Moderna) vaccine.</strong> And it upsets me very much because <strong>these people did not know that they were part of an experiment.”</strong>
^(6:30-6:48)</p>
<p>&rt;”But it grieved me that <strong>all of the patients that I have that now, have longterm ongoing neurological side effects, are all First Nations people.</strong> Because they were the people who got it first and the rest of us are just getting it now.”
^(19:45-20:29)</p>
<h2>Dr. Hoffe: microscopic blood clots</h2>
<p>“The blood clots we hear about which the media claim are very rare are the big blood clots which are the ones that cause strokes and show up on CT scans, MRI, etc. <strong>The clots I’m talking about are microscopic and too small to find on any scan. They can thus only be detected using the D-dimer test.”</strong></p>
<p>Dr Hoffe explains <strong>he has been performing D-dimer tests on his mRNA ‘vaccinated’ patients and he has worryingly identified that 62 percent of them had these microscopic blood clots.</strong></p>
<p>“These people have no idea they are even having these <strong>microscopic blood clots</strong>. The most alarming part of this is that there are <strong>some parts of the body like the brain, spinal cord, heart and lungs which cannot re-generate.</strong> When those tissues are damaged by blood clots they are permanently damaged.”</p>
<p>https://principia-scientific.com/doctor-heart-failure-from-mrna-jabs-will-kill-most-people/</p>
<h2>Dr. Hoffe explains his research findings to other doctors</h2>
<p>&rt;“The concern is now that these vessels are permanently damaged in a person’s lungs. When the heart tries to pump blood through all those damaged vessels, there’s increased resistance trying to pump the blood through those lungs. <strong>So those people are going to develop something called pulmonary artery hypertension, high blood pressure in their lungs, and the concern with that is that those people will probably all develop right-sided heart failure within three years and die.</strong>
Because they now have increased vascular resistance through their lungs and lung tissue and heart tissue and brain and spinal tissue, and all of that does not regenerate. In other tissues it can regenerate, liver and kidneys and muscle, but there’s some tissues that cannot, and <strong>so this absolutely explains what I’ve seen in my patients and that’s what I’m doing to prove it in my studies ongoing.”</strong>
^8:15-9:12
https://youtu.be/5sIWb9GTbbE</p>
<h2>“Hoffe and Kennedy June 1, 2021</h2>
<p>&rt;Hoff speaking to RFK:</p>
<p>&rt;“…Initially there were literally three that had disabilities from this… Some of them, for example, couldn’t open a jar anymore because both hands were so weak. …But most of them were neurological problems, loss of sensation, loss of strength and a major thing was chronic pain. Most of the side effects in people who received the Moderna vaccine began within 24 to 72 hours of receiving the shot… Ten of his patients now have ongoing neurological issues or shortness of breath — three months after receiving the Moderna vaccine.”</p>

        <p>&rt;Almost every day since then I’ve been driving myself mad thinking of all of the things I could have argued.</p>
<p>OP, I have done the same thing--sometimes I have had sleepless nights thinking, "if I had only raised this one additional point, then maybe I could've gotten through to them."</p>
<p>And then, some time later, I <em>will</em> have another conversation with them, and I'll raise that one additional point that I regretted not making the first time--and it bounces right off of them like all the previous points. </p>
<p>So I have come to learn that it doesn't matter. There is no shortage of mental gymnastic moves at their disposal to parry any attempts at rational discourse. They are under a spell.</p>

        <p>There’s absolutely no reason for young people with no underlying conditions to take it. The risks far outweigh the benefits and the only reason a lot of the people our age are taking it is to be able to go to school, keep their job, or to quell the fighting within their families.</p>
<p>This has ruined much of my passion for working in the healthcare sector. I still want to help people but apparently I can’t do it in that capacity unless I submit to this sketchy pharmaceutical for a disease that I’ve already had and have acquired protection to. It goes against everything they teach us in school about the immune system and now they’re insisting that we can’t do our jobs unless we suck it up and put our health on the line. It’s fucking bullshit</p>

        <p>Holyshit I could have written this exact post as a matter of fact I kind of did. If you look in my posting history I described a very similar situation with one of my doctors. I feel everything you do. Shock, disappointment, like I'm going crazy. Wondering if this doctor is just honestly stupid or if she's evil and manipulating people. You are not alone. I have a friend who went through the same thing with her doctor and several people here have reported it. I'm convinced a lot of these doctors are incentivized to do this. I'm so sorry you experienced this too!</p>
<p>Here is my experience, just know you're not alone!</p>

        <p>&rt;About two weeks ago I had a general doctors appointment scheduled. . .</p>
<p>There you go.  Your first mistake was to go to the doctor.  Why would a healthy person visit one?  The only possible result would be for them to find something "wrong with you" and get their meathooks into your skin.  Bad idea.  Healthy people don't need doctors - that's the whole point of trying to be healthy.  And once you are, you don't need to see a doctor for them to confirm it.</p>

        <p>"I don't want to discuss it." Then you go on to discuss it.</p>
<p>You call it a vaccine. It is not a vaccine. It is experimental gene therapy. </p>
<p>Don't fall for the propaganda and fall into their manipulation traps. There are more of us than there are of them. The huge amount of propaganda and bribery begging for people to get the experimental injections is proof of that. Look at the MASSIVE protests in Britain, France, and Greece. You do need to search a little to find honest videos and reports of the true numbers because they are being heavily censored. More proof the forces of Good are winning. </p>

        <p>There are ALWAYS ways around things. The OP could stop seeing this doctor, begin seeing a doctor online for stuff that doesn't need in-person consultation, move and find another one, etc. If the desire is strong enough, they will find a way; otherwise they will find an excuse.</p>

        <p>I had basically the same kinda thing happen with my  family physician the office nurse and the guy from pharma who reviews and changes medication I think he’s a pharmacist it’s a big family clinic after researching I decided not at this time they made contact by telephone 4 times repeatedly said no I have serious health issues  recently I was a jurvinski cancer centre for check up and bloodwork first nurse says we recommend vax and made a notation in file that  I didn’t have it  next up is a dr I don’t know never met she goes thru all the reasons the vax is good I’m staying  calm on the outside  I’m boiling mad inside I feel the pressure I tell her I’m getting my info from cdc and from government websites I ask how this will affect my lymphoma and Crohn’s disease which is not under control as I can’t get a scope done to check progress will it affect my  cranial aneurysms if I have a reaction and have a seizure like the adverse reactions I seen people have  she’s states these things are very rare I say have you read the cdc or the lancet medical journal or went on Canadian death rates etc she looks shocked and says she will get the dr now I’m thinking omfg they going to refuse to treat me now however he enters room and never said one word on the vaccine we all need to ask more learn more and be prepared for the good bad or ugly because as you said the insanity is here I know the pain of lonely isolated and helpless  for the last 18 months  fuck it I’m going to do what I feel is best for me not some miss guided brainwashed drs idea of what is right thank god I have my family vaxxed people never seem to call anymore lol we never stopped visiting we did limit if anyone was ill in the last 2 weeks we stayed home I don’t have the plague I’m really wondering how will people be any kinda normal today stage 3 opening in Hamilton I still see rubber gloves and one person in vehicle with mask the fear mongers have to be stopped</p>

        <p>Fellow Canadian here 🙋‍♂️ </p>
<p>Apparently our medical boards are pressuring our doctors to be pro covid vaccines, and doctors who offer alternative treatments are either ostracized or let go. Your doctor is either an ideologue or under intense peer pressure, both of which are unacceptable from the people we look to for potentially life altering advice.</p>

        <p>Im in the same position. Healthy, 28, female and a caregiver in a long term care facility. I dont have health insurance, havent been to a doctor in years. If I went to a doctor appointment and they disrespected me like that I would have calmly stood up, walked out and slammed the door on the way. Dont you dare lie to me when it comes to my health or try to guilt trip me into any medical procedure thats not in my best interest. Thats not a doctor, thats a quack.</p>

        <p>So sorry this happened to you. Our family doctor shamed my father for simply asking about COVID prevention (vitamin D) and other ways to protect himself.. our doctor’s just awful. Most Americans don’t understand how hard it is to switch doctors in Canada.</p>

        <p>Here's a nice, scientific article from The Lancet, explaining how the Pfizer 95% efficacy is a total scam. That 95% is based on relative risk reduction, whereas the absolute risk reduction is only 0.85%! But they can't sell that to the media. </p>
<p>I'm a Physician Assistant and an old friend who works in Primary Care was totally brainwashed. She claimed her patients were dying from Covid-19, even pediatric patients. In the entire US, less than 400 under 18 have died from Covid and those who did had comorbidities. Sad but that's a lesser number that an average flu season. </p>
<p>What kills me is that no one ever apologizes and says, hey you were right about the scamdemic. Good for you to be skeptical, now go to medical school yourself, you're smart!

        <p>did you know that 1 19 year old died of a car accident ?don't ever go outside again it's dangerous !!!!</p>
<p>besides that 19 year old was probably overweight with diabetes or something like that.</p>
<p>you could probably sue her for misspractice as she lied on your face.<br>
a lot of doctors are among the most brainwashed of them all as the idea of listening to the system has been ingrained in them constantly in university.</p>

        <p>Same thing happened to me. Had to call doctor on an unrelated issue. Immediately got quizzed on if I got the shot. I said I wasn’t comfortable with the novel technology, etc. Doctor gaslights me and says  “oh, it’s just a tiny little piece of mRNA.”</p>
<p>A tiny little piece of mRNA.  Like, why I am so scared about that? <br>
Wish I would’ve said, oh it’s just a tiny virus and yet we shut our whole society down for it. But didn’t think of that at the time as I was so surprised. This is a doctor I had trust for. Not anymore. I got a clue the doctor was gullible a while ago when they went on and on about Greta and how *amazing* &amp; inspiring she is, etc. <br>
Then, the doctor goes on about how I’ll “need” the shot to travel and go to restaurants. It was truly unbelievable. I just made it like, yeah I’ll consider it to get doctor to stop the disgusting hard sell. <br>
I thought about the interaction for a long time, just couldn’t believe the lack of respect for the fact that I wasn’t interested in taking the experimental drug. Also, these doctors are supposed to be educated about risk/benefits with drugs and thus proved to me that they have drunk the propaganda Kool Aid big time .</p>

        <p>Someone I confide in has regular dealings with hospital workers. They if they want to be employed are not getting the choice to be vaccinated or not. And it’s not just this one for c19, it’s for everything. She was telling me a surgeon was basically ready to operate on someone (I guess scrubbing up?), and the hospital staff came in with the flu shot for that year, and jabbed him. This was the surgeon telling my confidant this. </p>
<p>Many hospital staff do not want it, but it’s being forced on them if you want to retain employment.</p>

        <p>I would definitely be looking for a new doctor, STAT.</p>
<p>I've been fortunate.  I've seen my doctor a few times over this past year for an ongoing condition, and never once has she asked if I've had the vaccine or wanted it.</p>
<p>You're doing the right thing, and others will see it in time.  Even if they don't, it's your personal freedom to not get it, just as you have a choice when it comes to the flu shot.</p>

        <p>Best way to tell people about not taking the vac, or just any important decision = "I got my reasons". It shows you're not willing to argue about it.</p>
<p>Her advice holds some weight because she's a healthcare professional, and that's something to think about. However that's not the issue you saw her for so it would have been better if she hadn't touched the topic at all.</p>

        <p>Any doctor who forces their opinion down your throat isn’t a good doctor. Sure there are some basic facts that aren’t debatable like white sugar is bad for you or water is good for you but most things are not set in stone. Doctors are technically scientists and therefore should recognize that there are no laws in science. Data and common beliefs change daily. I would recommend getting a new doctor and one that does his job and explains the facts to you in simple terms. It is clear you cannot trust this doctor and therefore you cannot give him control over your body. Doctors know that most people will just blindly trust them because they went to school for 8 years.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I'm with the Doc on this one. You work in a place with old folks. All the discussion we have here is of the absurdity for healthy, not old people  to get the vax and pointing out all of the lies &amp; hypocrisy from the establishment. The discussion hasn't drifted into relevant spaces much because most of the mainstream force is like get the vax or else you cant shop, see concerts, work in the office etc.</p>
<p>You actually work around old people though. The virus is real and it targets old people. Don't get it twisted, im not getting vaxxed and it's cool that you don't, but imo, not when working around old people. Get a new job.</p>

        <p>I saw a post on askdocs the other day near the top where the topic was their doctor told them not to take to the vax because they had seen more people injured by it than they ever saw with covid.</p>
<p>So of course the replies, which as I understand were real verified docs of some sort were a resounding 'they're crazy, report them to the state so they lose their license' and then the mod locked the thread for 'antivax nonsense.'</p>

        <p>You should ask her to run through each of the ingredients on that vaccine and explained to you why it's safe for them to be put in your body. Since she's a doctor. And since the vaccine companies aren't liable for damages, perhaps she'd agree to take on the liability?</p>

        <p>You work with mostly elderly and immunocompromised people. The mRNA vaccine is significantly less effective in the elderly and those who are immunocompromised. Further, many people who are immunocompromised cannot get vaccinated. That’s why workers’ in LTC homes should be vaccinated. This isn’t about your personal rights and freedoms - it’s literally about potentially killing someone. It’s totally understandable if you don’t want the vaccine but given your line of work, maybe it’s time to re-evaluate your priorities and values. In BC, workers in LTC who are not fully vaccinated now have to wear a surgical mask and have frequent rapid covid tests. I imagine other provinces will follow in these protocols.  You are young; there are plenty  of other job options outside of healthcare.</p>

        <p>The lack of evidence showing moderate to severe illness due to covid 19, including death, in fully vaccinated people suggests otherwise. Even with the delta variant in Israel, the mRNA vaccine is still 93% effective at preventing serious illness and hospitalization. If you don’t want to get vaccinated for whatever reason, that’s your prerogative. The vaccine is effective.</p>

        <p>63% of the population in Israel has received at least one covid vaccine so that statistic would actually make sense. Unless you are trying to say that 75% of covid-19 related hospitalizations in Israel are vaccinated people, which is entirely different. Fully vaccinated? Half vaccinated?

        <p>I can't read Hebrew so I am unable to understand the link you posted. So I did a little digging:</p>
<p>On July 18th, Israel reported 61 hospitalized people in serious condition due to covid. 24 were unvaccinated (39%), and 37 were fully vaccinated (61%). However, no one under the age of 50 was fully vaccinated, compared to 14 unvaccinated people. This is significant.</p>
<p>But still, that's a significant amount of people over the age of 50 who are fully vaccinated and hospitalized. Why is that? Well, for one, 90% of Israelis 60+ have been fully vaccinated so statistically, it is significantly more likely for this group to be overrepresented (this is basic statistics). Another reason is that people who are fully vaccinated may take fewer precautions and increase their exposure risk; they may be immunocompromised so the vaccine is less effective. The vaccine is less effective the old you are.</p>
<p>But still, considering all that, is 37 hospitalized an unexpected number? The population of Israel is around 9 million; if you isolate 60+-year-olds (12.5% of the population), that's around 1.12 million. If 90% are fully vaccinated, that's around 1 million. Right now, the covid test positivity rate in Israel is 1.58% so out of those one million, around 15,800 may be exposed to covid. If the vaccine is 93%, we'd expected 1,106 to become symptomatic. If 5% of covid cases are severe, that's about 55 fully vaccinated 60+ hospitalized, less than those currently hospitalized. Of course, Pfizer and Moderna were tested against the OG strain of covid and with emerging variants, the current vaccines will become less effective. So I anticipate higher numbers of both fully and non-vaccinated people, with significantly higher death rates in those non-vaccinated.  </p>
<p>Also, I'm not American, I have no idea what your CDC is doing, nor do I really care. Covid is a worldwide concern, not just American. There are much more significant and deadly consequences.</p>

        <p>It’s amusing you say this because most workers at my centre, including the janitors, do not want the vaccine.</p>
<p>I quit my job to work there, because the government in my province called on the people to drop everything and help out. Was I being immoral and horrible for the first year+ when the vaccine didn’t exist?</p>
<p>I have never tested positive for COVID despite working directly with patients who did. I’m very careful in social situations and I stay vigilant, I get tested before most of my shifts. I’m not anti-covid or anti-every covid measure, I simply do not want to risk getting an experimental shot in my body that has proven to be dangerous for people my age. I’d like to have babies and a healthy heart, for example. If you think I’m selfish for protecting my personal health while simultaneously following all of the same safety and health protocols that worked oh-so-well pre-vaccine, so be it. Your head is too far up your own virtue signalling ass for you to even consider any other information. Do you simply ignore the reporting of the risks? It’s so hard for me to understand people who think (or don’t) like you…</p>

        <p>Did I call you selfish? No. I said you should re-evaluate your priorities and values, which you seemed to have interpreted negatively. If you value your personal freedom and rights above the livelihood of others, and above your responsibility to the most vulnerable population in our society you care for, healthcare is probably not the right career for you. But anyways, once LTC homes require masks for non-vaccinated workers, you’ll see where you stand amongst your colleagues and you may be treated by families and patients differently.</p>

        <p>This is exactly the kind of divisive garbage that everyone on this sub hates. You are essentially wishing that I will be forced into submission by wearing the symbolic mask of the unvaccinated, hoping that it will cause me to be bullied to the point that I either comply or lose my job. Think about how disgusting that is. </p>
<p>On the same note, world do you live in? I’ve been wearing an N95 every day for 8 hours a day since 2020 at work, not to mention a full gown, gloves, and face shield. I am also fortunate to work with enough like-minded individuals who don’t judge or hate on others for questioning putting a rushed medical experiment into their bodies. We were offered the first dose in December 2020. So little people agreed to getting it that they moved on to give it to the general public months before anticipated. </p>
<p>How exactly do you think me getting the vaccine, which does not stop transmission, helps protect the fully-vaccinated patients? You said that it’s because the vaccine isn’t as effective for them, okay. Lets say I get vaccinated. Now let’s say I get infected anyway, and bring it in, because that is 100% possible. How exactly did my vaccination status help in the chain of infection? Did I bring in covid either way? I still brought it in. The vaccine still isn’t protecting the patients fully. The vaccine doesn’t change the amount of covid I will bring in, the strain, or anything like that. It is meant to reduce the symptoms for ME, not others. This treatment has been twisted to “help the community” when in reality that is not what a vaccine does. It protects you. I am 22 years old and do not need protecting. </p>
<p>The leaps of logic and mental gymnastics must be incredibly exhausting for you…</p>

        <p>I work in the largest ICU in Western Canada with the sickest covid patients in my province….for the last 16 months….wearing full Airborne gear with direct clinical care and surgical mask/eye wear whenever at bedside. Due to my high risk environment, I was also offered the vaccine in December and, with my like-minded medical, nursing, pharmacy and respiratory colleagues, we all got vaccinated. There weren’t enough vaccines. Maybe because we understand and trust the science; maybe because we understand the seriousness of covid; maybe because we recognize that as licensed healthcare professionals we are bounded by a code of ethics and a duty to protect our patients. Your comments regarding vaccines suggests you don’t understand how vaccines work, that vaccines do in fact reduce virus transmission and that herd immunity is really the best way we can protect the vulnerable  around us. Ignorance is bliss though.</p>

        <p>Explain to me how vaccines work then, please! I would love to be enlightened. </p>
<p>Can I still get infected with COVID if fully vaxxed? 
Can I still transmit COVID while fully vaxxed?
Can my patients still be infected with COVID by me if I’m fully vaxxed?</p>
<p>ICU must be extremely difficult, and it makes sense that you would all be inclined to get the vaccine. You have quite literally seen the worst of it. Does that mean that the worst of it applies to the general public? I don’t think so. </p>
<p>I understand the science, but you’re right, I don’t trust all of it. I don’t trust medical professionals and scientists being silenced for simply questioning what’s going on. I don’t trust the government/pharmaceutical industry for pushing a vaccine on every single healthy person and child when there are both preventative treatments and medications to significantly reduce the signs, symptoms, and complications of COVID infection. </p>
<p>Nice that you mentioned herd immunity. That happens naturally too, you know that right? I’m not anti-vax, I’m anti-this vax. I would get it if I knew with 100% certainty that I would not have any complications from it. </p>
<p>Stay safe out there and be kind to everyone regardless of personal medical decisions. Our body, our choice. You swore an oath to protect that too.</p>

        <p>“In April, Public Health England reported the results of a large study of COVID-19 transmission involving more than 365,000 households with a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated members.</p>
<p>It found immunisation with either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine reduced the chance of onward virus transmission by 40-60%”</p>
<p>https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/mounting-evidence-suggests-covid-vaccines-do-reduce-transmission-how-does-work</p>
<p>My whole point is that you are NOT the general public - you are a LTC worker, working in an environment with the most vulnerable population to covid 19. And you seem to not understand that by not getting vaccinated, you could kill someone at work. And the only treatment we have that can prevent infection and drastically reduce infection is….vaccination. You can never be certain with ANY medication that there aren’t potential complications. You can get Stevens Johnson Syndrome from taking Tylenol or Benadryl. Anyways, I eagerly await to see how the rest of the provinces will move forward regarding mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers.</p>

        <p>You should not be working with immuno compromised people. </p>
<p>The vaccine works, but its not 100% effective. You, by not being vaccinated,  increase the risk of those immune compromised people catching the virus from you. Very simple stuff. </p>
<p>With the vaccine, you would have a decreased chance of catching the virus (not a zero chance), and therefore are much less likely to spread it to others who may not be as healthy or young as you are.</p>

        <p>Actually patently false. Vaccine does not prevent you from getting the virus. It prevents you from getting severely sick. Therefore it's more important to use the vaccine to protect yourself more then it protects someone else. Apparently this isn't so simple because you don't even know what you're talking about. </p>
<p>The CDC and WHO both said in February and March that there is no data if COVID vaccine prevents spread. They now are saying because hospitalizations are down that's proof of preventing transmission. Convenient but a correlation is not a causation. There isn't enough data for them to make that call. Three months ago they didn't have that opinion. Now all of a sudden they do. In 3 more months they will make other claims. However they aren't performing a double blind randomized control on vaccinated vs unvaccinated so it's all irrelevant due to confounding variables.</p>

        <p>The vaccine does reduce the chance of infection as shown in this cdc study that concluded in March https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0329-COVID-19-Vaccines.html</p>
<p>Im not arguing against the fact that the cdc, the who, and governmental organizations  have had conflicting and contradicting statements about covid.</p>
<p>But that is because these organizations aren't omnipotent; they need studies to back claims they make, so they can't just say things without proof. That's why opinions change, and how science works.</p>

        <p>How effective are COVID vaccines against transmission of SARS-CoV-2?</p>
<p>Unknown. Data are limited to assess the effect of the vaccine against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from individuals who are infected despite vaccination. Demonstrated high efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 may translate to overall prevention of transmission in populations with high enough vaccine uptake, though it is possible that if efficacy against asymptomatic infection were lower than efficacy against symptomatic infection. Additional evaluations including data from clinical trials and from vaccine use post-authorization will be needed to assess the effect of the vaccine in preventing virus shedding and transmission, in particular in individuals with asymptomatic infection.</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download</p>
<p>Key words unknown, data is unlimited, require more data from clincial trials post-authorizarion (aka people currently being experimented on).</p>

        <p>From your source, 2 pages before the excerpt you gave me (page 46 of the document):</p>
<p>"8.1. Known Benefits
The known benefits among recipients of the proposed vaccine relative to placebo are:
• Reduction in the risk of confirmed COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2
• Reduction in the risk of confirmed COVID-19 after Dose 1 and before Dose 2"</p>
<p>Even if there's not enough data to conclude the effects of the vaccine on transmissibility, doesn't simply reducing the risk of infection in the first place reduce the risk of transmission? Covid-19 is a highly contagious virus, so reducing infections leads directly to reducing transmissions.</p>
<p>Later on:</p>
<p>"The protocol-specified 2-dose vaccination regimen was highly effective in preventing PCR confirmed COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after completion of the vaccination regimen."</p>
<p>To be clear, I don't think anybody should be forced to take the vaccine. However, denying its benefits is irresponsible in the case of the OP who works directly with immuno-compromised people who could get seriously ill or die because the OP refuses to get vaccinated, gets infected, and transmits the disease.</p>
<p>If the OP doesn't want to get vaccinated, then she shouldn't work with those people.</p>

        <p>The hell are you talking about? Just like you and I, the doctors also don’t know shit about the side effects and the long term effects of the fauci ouchie. Doctors these days aren’t really treating anyone anymore. They simply prescribe medication and it’s a one size fits all approach for everyone.</p>

        <p>That’s a pretty weird approach to have to healthcare and a very American one at that lmao. You do understand that healthcare works differently in different countries, and I might understand not taking every single word from a doctor’s mouth as gospel, but you must be pretty daft to first say that someone is your trusted and experienced doctor (meaning no problems beforehand and good healthcare) and then turn around and suddenly decide that they’re an ignorant idiot because they don’t embrace your conspiracy theories. Jesus christ people lmao.</p>

        <p>Vaccine has an estimated 95% protection rate against covid from last year. Estimated 70% against delta variant. This number drops significantly in higher aged patients. </p>
<p>Example: you get the flu shot. You can still get the flu, it just is less likely to be a bad flu. </p>
<p>Example2: you and your grandpa get the flu shot. A friend visits who has the flu. Grandpa can still die from pneumonia caused by the flu. </p>
<p>Apply the same logic to covid vaccines, and that’s why you should get vaccinated.</p>
<p>As for death rates: as a 22 year old, you are unlikely to die. However, the stats do suggest that you can still suffer from long haul covid symptoms <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/04/210407174321.htm">Covid long haul rates</a>
This study suggests 10% long term rate even 8 months after recovery. </p>
<p>Anecdotes suggest that long haul effects tend to dissipate around the 12-14 month mark, but can still cause lifelong complications. </p>
<p>I realize this subreddit is an echo chamber so I’ll likely get bashed. 
Preferred: If you have any reliable sources for reasons to avoid the shot, I’d love to see them (please and thank you). 
A friend sends me sources from rumble ... please for the love of all that’s good do not use rumble as a news source, it is a clickbait site that makes money off of ad revenue and is actively feeding on disinformation. If you must use a conservative news source, at least make it reliable. Even OAN at least tried to hide when they were spouting BS by hiding their nonsense in video format</p>
<p>Rant done. 
Get the jab, you are actively making a decision that does put you, loved ones, and patients at risk. 
If you don’t mind putting others at risk, please find a job that doesn’t involve caring about other people’s health. There are many available that will be better for your mental health too.</p>

<li>You couldn’t pay me to fuck you. Seriously, why even try to use that as a response, never made sense to me. Unless you mean it as a punishment...in which case, is that a self burn? Why would you consider fucking you a punishment? Hon if you have body dysmorphia, it may be worth it to let your doc know. Stay healthy, hon, you’ll get through it. But back to me, I prefer knowing a person for a while and actually, you know, liking them, before getting that intimate. I wish you the best though!</li>
<li>People who have adverse reactions to the vaccine or vaccines in the past need to report that and let it be known to their health care professional that they cannot get the vaccine (or get a second vaccine). However, those around them should get the vaccine so as to better protect the one who can’t. </li>
<li>People with tendencies towards strong inflammation responses or who have issues with their blood vessels should absolutely be concerned about the vaccine and should converse with their doctor in charge of their condition about the vaccine. They should also seek to actively log how they feel over the next six weeks, and have people they can communicate with to perform regular check-ins to ensure they are alright. Luckily, no one has yet died due to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines have reported potential relation to blood clots at a rate of 1 case per million vaccinations. It was observed that the patients had lower than normal platelet counts, which, since you do work in health care, I’m sure you know this is very odd. The mechanism for these clots is still not known <a href="yalemedicine.org/news/coronavirus-vaccine-blood-clots">Yale analysis of blood clots with vaccine</a>. At a rate of 1 case per million, that is less than the normal rate of death by blood clot (100k per year on the US means a rate of death of 1/3000). </li>
</ol>
<p>Moving on: honey, adverse reactions to vaccines occur after a few weeks, not a few years (at least as far as we can tell). We’d have seen far more evidence of adverse reaction. </p>
<p>Gene therapy techniques require multiple (yes, more than 2) applications over the course of more than a year. 
A vaccine and its booster that tell your body to make spike proteins do not alter your DNA, they simply inject instructions, the same way your nuclei do, and vaccine patients are hardly guinea pigs. That honor belongs back in 2005 when the opposite method (RNA interference) was used to help people with glaucoma and rats with diabetes (I never saw RNAi used for people with diabetes, sadly). RNA vaccines are simply instruction sets to make a spike protein. Think of them like a really dumb virus that doesn’t tell your cells to replicate the vaccine or the virus, just a single very identifiable part of the virus. Another (more fun) way to think of it is like the US using old defunct tanks for target practice and military training. </p>
<p>The only existing vaccine that can cause full self replication is the Oral Polio vaccine, which uses eviscerated polio virus to generate immunity, but those eviscerated parts can still recombine to form a fully functional polio virus. Sadly, we still don’t know the mechanics of this. Luckily, that vaccine is heavily monitored and generally avoided. </p>
<p>Conclusion: hon...find new news sources, and please stop giving me ammo that can be used to be a “condescending asshole”. Believe me, I love spreading science :)
As for fucking myself...does my hand count? Cause that won’t be a problem</p>

        <p>Who cited CNN? CNN has really ridden the downhill. Gotta focus on NPR, they are a delight and actually fact check their work. For other news sources, I suggest peer reviewed articles and scientific papers. They can be a bit dry, but they've been getting better about using more accessible modes of communication over the past few years. Or maybe it's just been easier to read them? Or maybe I've just been finding more that are about more intuitive topics? Either way, the covid papers are generally intuitive, 10/10 would recommend having a hayday with those. I know you guys don't trust the government, so I won't suggest using government sources. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As a rule, though ::<br>
1. Don't trust the government? I agree, the government has done some shady stuff over the years. Good for you</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don't trust big pharma, hospital management, or businesses? I agree, even shadier (Personally, not all business people are bad, but almost every bad person I've encountered has been a business person)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doctors? Hon...the majority of doctors are doing medicine out of altruism and want to help you. They don't care about big pharma OR the government, and often lobby against both to provide better healthcare. I'll agree with don't trust the government or big pharma, but when the *majority* doctors around the world, with no ties to business, money, or government, are saying the vaccine is a valuable part of public health? Believe them! They have nothing to gain by lying to you. You think Big Pharma is paying doctors in India and Africa to actively beg for vaccines? You think that big pharma is paying doctors in the US to advocate for a vaccine when they already have the US Government advocating for it?</p>

        <p>Normally I’d agree, my primary argument against this is that if the vaccine were unsafe, a large percentage of doctors would risk their license to contest it. Currently the percentage is small. Doctors tend to have good ethics so when a majority of doctors give the same input, my money is that they are telling the truth. 
Now, if the government were keeping something from the doctors, thats worthy of note, and while it is possible, I also know many doctors would have put the vaccine through the ringer to check for issues before recommending it and would have gladly said something. Many doctors have, but my point is that the percentage is small enough to not offer a large enough concerned opposition.</p>

        <p>I see what your saying, I believe most would go along with it and not say anything and they know what would happen if they did. It is so heavy censored that if you say anything negative or question it at all, is instantly removed. Also think that is why many doctors don't see what others are publishing because it is immediately censored.</p>

        <p>Valid point, that same censorship is a hurdle. Luckily that same censorship isn’t common in the scientific community. Well, to an extent. The way to get censored there is by using faulty test methods or data, and that has happened on many covid studies (on both sides, but the percentage of retractions is much higher on the anti vaccine side, mostly due to falsified data or low sample sizes (a lot of them have been painful to read, but fun to poke holes in). A sad example of censoring is the censoring of Dr. Robert Malone. While he hasn’t been a part of RNA research for a while, he still did some of the initial work on the vaccine. It would have been more beneficial for reporters to use his caution to generate a scientific conversation about the progress of RNA based treatments and the different types that are in research and what they are used for. 
Example: Dr. Malone was concerned that the could cause changes to Gene Expression (note: does not change DNA, only changes how DNA is read). There is an RNA treatment that would work that way (it is called RNA interference, or RNAi). The problem is that this method would have to be enacted on each blood cell directly, and since blood cells are short lived, the vaccine would need to be injected into the bone marrow so that all new blood cells generated from the marrow get the treatment. The mRNA method takes advantage of a feedback loop in the immune system that causes increased antibody memory, but it doesn’t affect any gene expression. Dr. Malone also expressed concern about it not being well tested or that data was being hidden. From what I’ve seen, that may be the case, but it is doubtful that so much data could be hidden for so long. Something would slip eventually. Either way, it appears Dr. Malone (or a related party) has either issued a court order to keep Google from showing negative search results for his name, or has paid them. </p>
<p>Conclusion: currently, those being censored are being censored because they are falsifying data (like the papers that I mentioned) or because they are enabling a mindset that poses a greater danger to public health than the vaccine would cause otherwise (example: the J&amp;J vaccine is now estimated to have serious adverse effects at a rate of 7 per million doses for women under 50. Assuming every woman under 50 got the vaccine (approx 117.6M according to US Census data), that would result in 829 or so vaccine related deaths/injury for women under 50. Covid related deaths for women under 50 sits at just over 10k. Covid related long term health issues sits at 10-25% of recovered patients, putting the number of people with long term health issues due to covid at 3.4M-8M, or roughly 1-3% of the country (Census reported total population as 328.2M in 2019). </p>
<p>Just going off of public health data, the vaccine does work against serious covid symptoms. </p>
<p>Final thing: my cousin is a doctor and has seen covid patients in hospital. It is real, and she was among the first at her hospital to get her vaccine. She also can’t keep a secret to save her life (other than patient info). If they were being strong armed into misrepresenting data, she’d be the first to spill the tea into the harbor. For me, I still trust what the docs say, but I also trust what the docs do: getting the vaccine</p>
<p>Now if you want to truly distrust the data there is one data set that has oddities that ive found. No I’m not gonna say what it is on this echo chamber because it will be used to disbelieve doctors, who i trust with my life (quite literally), but if I see someone reference it I’m gonna smile and wave. Have fun on the hunt!</p>

        <p>There’s no use in arguing, no one will change their minds. We are way past that point.</p>
<p>Get your vaccine if you want and good luck! You are not preaching to the right group of people here though.</p>

        <p>Oh I know. That's half the fun is that I get an excuse to go read more scientific papers. Like you said, I'm already biased towards believing what a majority of doctors around the globe are saying (I mean...they don't share countries, so that bars the argument that they are being told to say things by the government, because they run on different governments. And heaven knows big pharma can't be paying them all off to screw people over. Most doctors actually have ethics to stand by!) But more personally, since I am biased, it can be difficult to come up with reasons to not listen to science. You guys provide me with perfect search terms to go and actually look up good papers! I can't thank you enough, really :)</p>

        <p>So she should still take a new form of vaccine never before released for use on humans with a rushed release, severe lack of testing, laundry list of issues that keeps growing, and zero liability for the damages it causes because someone who also got it might get sick if she doesn't? And this actually makes sense to you?</p>

        <p>Wonderful questions! I will gleefully answer ::<br>
1. Rushed release : this type of vaccine (mRNA) has been in research for over 20 years. I remember first hearing about it on an episode of NOVA back in 2005 (although they mostly covered the reverse of mRNA vaccines, RNA interference, which was being looked into for the purpose of curing cases of glaucoma and diabetes)<br>
2. Lack of testing : again....20 years of research...<br>
3. Laundry list of issues : so far relegated to vaccines that do not use mRNA, such as Johnson and Johnson (in US), and Astrazeneca (in Europe) at a rate of 1 case per million. Source provided in comment above. Pfizer and Moderna have no attributed long term negative side effects<br>
4. Liability : sadly, this part I can't refute. The US Gov did set up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, but it is terribly funded and rarely actually awards liability payments. Canada does have a "Vaccine Injury Support Program" to support those who see long term side effects or injury due to the vaccine. It is fairly new, and appears to be made for the express purpose of peace of mind about the vaccine. However, that can be used to actually force it to make a payout in the event of vaccine injury. <br>
Solution : get Pfizer or Moderna to avoid adverse effects.  </p>
<p>Caveat : if you have existing sensitivity or adverse reactions to vaccines, don't get the vaccine. If you have existing conditions that cause worse instances of inflammation or immune response, talk to your doctor first before getting ANY vaccine, especially the covid vaccine. While the covid vaccine does not usually cause long term health effects, it does usually cause mild side effects such as sore arm or feeling ill for a few days, and this can be exacerbated by existing sensitivities for inflammation. Still, far better than the 10%+ chance for long term effects due to covid.</p>
