        <p>TL;DR: The lockdowns were part of a Chinese disinformation campaign. They are built on a totalitarian government taking control of social media through shell corporations.</p>

        <p>They're not necessarily part of it.  Certainly they deserve blame.</p>
<p>The propaganda plays into their vanity.  These measures all served to increase the power of the officials in charge, so they are naturally biased toward evidence and solutions that push in that direction.</p>
<p>If you're a state governor, declaring a state of emergency and locking down your population gives you both a giant pile of money from the feds that doesn't have to go through the legislative process (ie, can be distributed to your cronies), AND gives you the power to micromanage what businesses have to shut down or stay open (which can also be biased toward your cronies).</p>

        <p>Let me clarify. Those who are being elected have no idea the driving force that social media can be. This is an explaination of why it’s basically being dismissed that it happened in Italy...</p>
<p>It’s social media, if it happens on the internet it happening everywhere. I don’t believe the Chinese would only hire Italian speaking social media brigades. </p>
<p>I believe those who are currently elected would see this article and dismiss it as just people talking on social media, because those elected officials don’t understand social media’s power.</p>
<p>Or I’m wrong, and those elected officials play dumb better than I give them credit for and the social media campaigns that most certainly were done in many various languages happened. The elected officials choose for whatever reason to not see if that happened in other nations and if the popular opinion of lockdown needs revisited because pitiable bias in where the information is from.</p>
<p>I see the latter possibility as having a most sinister set of motives being involved. I do not see an altruistic answer for elected officials if it is proven that the Chinese swayed opinion in Italy in March.</p>

        <p>You're only focusing on the ELECTED officials, but there are many more fingers in this pie than who we vote for. And let us not forget that the people who invented the internet are now in their 60s. Those are the bulk of the people in power, not the folks in their 80s.</p>

        <p>And he’s the only one who’s had the balls against China    They want to become the worlds super power and it’s happened.   America is China with the god damn masks everywhere you go. Reddit was bought by a Chinese company (idk the percentage). They’re full of bots and ironically they bought Reddit in 2019 on and everyone forgot about Hong Kong hmmmm.   Trump just sent an official from his administration to Taiwan too   If he’s re elected it’s going to be Cold War 2.0 it’s just tough because so many of our companies make their bullshit there so idk how they do it</p>
