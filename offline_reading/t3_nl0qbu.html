    <p><p>I was taken to the hospital for am extreme panic attack because of am edible. They said they were gonna give me a saline solution to calm me down and they asked if I was vaccinated I said no. 5 minutes later one of the doctors or nurses walks over and puts a shot of something into my iv, I ask what it was and he said saline. I said I thought I was getting a bag of saline he said you are. I asked why couldn't they just put the shot of saline into the bag of saline, he didn't answer. Was I vaccinated against my will? After receiving the shot I jumped up and my heart raced even more than before and then I felt itchy. Nothing showed up about a shot of saline on my discharge papers. Just shows one saline bag. They gave me Ativan to calm me down but thay was after the "saline" shot. I felt like I could feel the shot going into my heart it messed up the rhythm. Anyway I need to know if this is standard protocol for giving saline please help nurses or doctors im so paranoid</p></p>

        <p>They did not forcibly vaccinate you.  Vaccines are intermuscular not intravenous.   </p>
<p>They may have had to flush your line with saline. You can taste and feel saline when it enters your blood.  </p>
<p>I have a chemo port and they flush it all the time and never put the saline flush on the paper only the actual meds they put into it. </p>
<p>Saline flush syringes are usually very large and screw on not poke in.  If you saw them inject something into the line it was the Ativan push.</p>

        <p>That would be a severe violation of protocol. ER Covid patients are kept in negative pressure rooms and the docs and nurses needed to gown up and strip down at the door.  </p>
<p>Otherwise they have Covid wards or ICUs.  In sperate areas.</p>

        <p>I can't guarantee the situation at that hospital but all the ones I have been to and it's a lot anyone with Covid symptoms get a special room that only sucks air in and the follow protective rules. </p>
<p>I mean you can pretty much catch anything at a hospital, they are full of sickness but assuming they were following guidelines the chance of known Covid patients being in general population is very low.  My hospital screens for Covid symptoms at the door every time I enter the ER or Cancer Center.  They still take it pretty serious.</p>

        <p>No, they wouldn't do that because they'd want you to have the card and proof that they gave it to you, and would have to coordinate a second injection and NOT a third.</p>

        <p>If it helps Ativan has caused me severe panic attacks when I just needed to calm down after surgeries. They prescribe that like candy and you have to ask for a Xanax or anything but Ativan. I’ve had it cause me to lose my mind two days after discharge before. They gave me more when I went back and it got worse. Don’t underestimate it. Used to work fine and something changed. Edibles too can do that. Keep some CBD around for that and take it if you’re too high. I’d say avoid Ativan if you’re having a panic attack from an edible or any other reason. Stick with Xanax.</p>

        <p>lol i'm sorry that happened to you, I really am, they were honestly probably just a bit annoyed (thc's LD50 is absurdly high - like you would need to consume like 2 kilos of pure thc or something - I have no basis for proof on this - just something I researched once but didn't remember the specifics except the lethal pure dose is larger than most stomachs - I suggest you research it yourself, it could give your high mind a bit of peace next time you feel too high) - they should have been more compassionate certainly, but yea, I'm sure some of the rudeness perceived was possibly just being mistaken for their certainty that you were likely in no real danger, not fair, but likely true (theres a pretty good funny scene in party down if you haven't watched that show and feel okay about laughing at the relatability a bit - where one guy takes an edible and calls the paramedics believing he is already dead)</p>
