    <strong>I need reassurance, please ):</strong>
    <p><p>So I have been super unwell and had a lot going on, I knew it would be best to distance myself from all this negativity for a bit. I was confronted for the first time by a close friend today and I explained how it's not just one sentence or one thing, to sum up, my opinions on covid, lockdown, and the vaccines. A lot about the world has taught me that I cannot trust the government. She basically said she was worried about me and that I sound paranoid.</p>
<p>I have a bad medical record filled with mental instability episodes but I am intelligent, a free thinker, a born questioner and am wise. But after constant belittling and invalidation for my views on things at the moment even concerning my health I have forgotten the key things to remember about my views on the new normal. She insinuated I have psychosis and I am scared she will tell someone about it all.</p>
<p>I am doubting my own beliefs now and am scared because she kept trying to say how paranoid I was and how I have control issues, I need to use what therapy taught me about radical acceptance, that I should see the wider benefit of taking the vaccine. She was constantly trying to get me to believe I was being inconsiderate for not believing in the severity of it. </p>
<p>I also don't believe in taking the gov's word as the truth, I shall and forever seek my own truth. I am basically asking for reassurance please because I feel so shit right now, literally being told that my faith and beliefs are psychosis is the most invalidating thing ever.</p></p>

        <p>She said 'we need to take the vaccine to eradicate the disease and save people's lives.' I explained that that's what she has been fed by all these adverts and things. Talk to real people about it, brainstorm. The main question is why is no one questioning?</p>

        <p>Anyone who uses "eradicate Covid" can be comfortably ignored, that is the delusional position. Whether you feel the vaccine will benefit you is your decision only, and you should not let anyone pressure or gaslight you into submitting to an unproven medical intervention.</p>

        <p>Now that's what I call gaslighting! Look if you can't see what's going on then I'm sorry the one with the delusional psychosis is the person that doesn't see what is happening here. I might give them a pass if they're actually blind.</p>

<p>You need to ditch this friend. If you can't and you are truly afraid of what she might do to you, then just play along with her until you can ditch her. That is not a friend at all. She's joined the covid cult.</p>

        <p>Although I feel like I say this too much, I feel that Jonathan Haidt's book "The Rational Mind:..." is a must read in dealing with Covid viewpoints. </p>
<p>Your friend quite simply sees the world differently. She's not wrong, but she isn't right. She sees society as a collection of individuals and therefore we have to do these things together or we fail. Most people that question Covid, and I believe you are in this boat, seem to see us like a sports team but in this case the coach makes questionable moves and has a gambling problem. We are part of something larger than ourselves and sometimes we have to question the leadership of our "team".</p>
<p>I would think that if you interact with your friend in the future, make sure to give her more questions than statements. Rather than saying "I don't believe the numbers", ask "What does it hurt to verify information?".  Rather than saying "masks are for sheep" ask "What information formed your opinion on masks" followed by "Why do you trust that information?"  I can't predict a whole conversation, but I have found that eventually they will sound crazy as they cling to a stance that they can't back up rationally. </p>
<p>Best of luck internet stranger!</p>

        <p>What helped me tremendously was stopping to identify myself with my current believes.<br>
That way my ego is completely out of the way when I discuss issues with others and I don't feel like I have to defend my thoughts anymore.</p>
<p>I also make sure to add phrases that make it clear that my thoughts are my thoughts.</p>
<p>On the same notion, I think it is a good idea to interpret what others say as their thoughts.</p>
<p>I think that by doing that it will become much less likely that anyone would feel invalidated from figuring out that their opinion differs from that of others.</p>

        <p>People are always going to call free thinkers crazy, paranoid, etc. Your life is the one you should be most concerned about. You don't have psychosis. Even if you have some mental health issues, you're still allowed to be a free thinker. If you don't want to get the vaccine, you don't get it. Don't let your terrible excuse as a friend convince you not to.</p>

        <p>"Paranoid" is a negative label used by people who have power to keep lessers from questioning their narrative. I'll take the craziest conspiracy theorist who thinks that moon men walk around in flesh suits over someone who blindly believes what the media and government tells them, at least I know the former is capable of independent thought. People who believe the official story about obvious lies are essentially dead, they may have a pulse but they lack necessary features of a living human being, namely the ability to reason and use abstract thought.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I may think a flat earther is crazy, but at least they are thinking. People that blindly believe, whether it is truth or a falsehood, are far worse in my book than someone who is objectively wrong but has formed their opinions based on their own research.</p>

        <p>It is so nice to not be alone in thinking this way, it is so hard to remind yourself that you are sane when others are saying the exact opposite so thank you so much for your validation.</p>

        <p>Doomers always just try to say we're psychotic, crazy, delusional, etc. since they've been brainwashed by the media and the government about this virus. They're actually the ones who are behaving in a more paranoid manner, IMO, if they sit inside most of the time and wear two masks when out. I don't think you sound psychotic.</p>

        <p>Basically, if you are living in fear then what's the point of being alive? Of course take necessary precautions based on your own risk assessment, but if you are miserable in exchange for feeling safe, what kind of life is that?</p>
