    <strong>Found on another site. Not my post, but it's sad to see that people have turned on the military.</strong>
    <p><p>I expect this to fall on deaf ears, as so much does here, but I wanted to share this anyways.</p>
<p>A civilian can quit their job. They can be fired and collect unemployment. A soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine can't do that. They can't just quit. They signed a contract.</p>
<p>If service members refuse the vaccine, they will be charged with disobeying an order. That is a court-martiable offense, and can result in other-than-honorable discharge, dishonorable discharge, and even prison. Getting a job with an OTH or BCD is very difficult, unless you decide you want to work at McDonald's for the rest of your life. Many service members have families, and can't just think of themselves. How many of you have watched The Patriot with Mel Gibson? At one point, when Mel's character is asked why he won't fight the British, he delivers a simple yet poignant line: "I'm a parent. I haven't got the luxury of principles."</p>
<p>For those of you who berate service members and accuse them of betraying their oath - where were you when our nation was in need? What did you do when the election was stolen? What did you do when our cities burned? What did you do when children across the nation were muzzled and locked down? Many of you posted Pepes, tweets of lIbTaRdS bEiNg OwNeD, or you did nothing. Don't get angry at these service members when you are perfectly capable of resisting and chose not to. Jesus said to remove the log from your own eye before you remove the splinter from your brother's.</p>
<p>The next time you want to hate on the military, remember, they're full of people just like you. These people have families, lives, and futures, and unlike you, can't just up and quit without being fucked for life. You're lucky. You have the freedom to quit, to collect unemployment. We don't. Look at the vaxxed people in Italy burning their passports in solidarity with unvaxxed people. We're on your side, and will continue to fight passports and mandates. We simply don't have the choice you do.</p></p>
