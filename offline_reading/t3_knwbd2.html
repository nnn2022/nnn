    <strong>what will 2021 be like?</strong>
    <p><p>what do you think 2021 will be like? Will it be more of the same? Will there continue to be lockdown measures? Will people get sick of it and finally stop listening?</p></p>

        <p>Probably lots of "mutations" will happen to justify keeping to lockdowns going.</p>
<p>Covid19 still wont be isolated bit we will move onto covid21 </p>
<p>I also think universal basic income will be introduced</p>
<p>Lots more small businesses will go under and more pople will be reliant on gov.</p>
<p>I hope im wrong</p>

        <p>I'm interested to see what happens at the end of January with Trump and Biden. I don't want to get into an election discussion, but considering how covid has been used politically up to this point, it will be interesting to see what the inauguration changes, if anything. </p>
<p>In general though, I think we're going to continue to see much of the same at least into the spring. When the virus naturally calms down (due to seasonal patterns), perhaps we will see some sort of lifting of the restrictions. </p>
<p>People's reactions is what really interests me for 2021. I think we're becoming more entrenched into our respective positions, meaning the people who were pro-restrictions are going to double down, and people who are anti will likewise. I think the change we will see, however, will be in the moderate fence sitters. The sentiment is already growing with many people getting tired of additional restrictions, obvious media fear-mongering with the new strain, the backtracking on the vaccine working... A lot of people who may have been on the fence before are starting to realize that something is up. I'm expecting to see more resistance in 2021 versus 2020. Put it like this - lots of people were willing to give the politicians and the medical community the benefit of the doubt, but I think that benefit is quickly eroding.</p>

        <p>I asked the pro lockdown people I know and they said we would go back to normal as long 50 - 75% of the world's population gets vaccinated at least. Everyone I knows are supporting the lockdown and restrictions. Some has guessed we can go back to normal again in the end of 2021 or 2022, depending on how effective the vaccine is, the death rate and case rate. They've guessed the pandemic would last in ca. 2 years in total. Maybe 3. No more concrete numbers have been mentioned.</p>

        <p>this whole time i have been thinking that 2020 is going to be the fluke year. that we will look back on this time and think "wow, how about that 2020 right guys?" that is the optimistic train of thought. it's dec 31st today and tomorrow will probably be like today with the restrictions and the day after that and so on, so this tells me that 2020 lockdown craziness will spread well into 2021. i so desperately want to believe that this is the fluke year instead of the year when everything took a turn for the worst. i don't want there to be a pre 2020 time and a post 2020 time like pre and post 9/11. </p>
<p>i think in 2021 there will be much of the same in 2020 just with the tide turning to pro and anti vaccine types. all dissent will be silenced on reddit for those against or even skeptical about the vaccine, and anything going awry with side effects will be played down just like extreme lockdown measures have been mostly played down. just from being at work, most seem to be a bit skeptical about the vaccine, mostly agreeing that it was rushed and not tested for a long enough time. but as more people get it and feel fine after taking the vaccine, that line of thinking will shift to the vaccine being considered 'safe'. at the end of the day however, people will always have bodily autonomy, so i think it should still hold that those who do not want this thing inserted into their body should be allowed to hold that position. if i am not being arrested or dying and in need of resuscitation, i know that no one has the right to touch me in any way, certainly not with a needle.</p>

        <p>I think it depends on where you live. I live in Utah, and for the most part things have been relatively good here the whole time. I was getting haircuts and going bowling in April. We didn't have a statewide mask mandate until October. And outside of having to wear masks inside stores, most things are fairly normal here. And I have yet to run into a mask nazi when I wear my mask on my chin. Most people here are kinda over it. There are some pockets in Salt Lake City where I'm sure you'll find more hard core maskers, but for the most part mask wearing is very casual here. There are some capacity limits at restaurants, but unless you are going to a very popular restaurant on a Friday or Saturday night, you wouldn't really even know there was any sort of restrictions. Movie theaters are open. You can go see plays. Ski resorts are open. My kids have had in person school this whole year without even a hint of outbreak freakouts or the threat of closing down. The kids have to wear masks, but from what I gather, they give them tons of mask breaks. There was a point in mid November where our numbers were getting pretty high, and that would have been the time when stricter restrictions would have seemed likely, but that time came and went with no new restrictions. Now we are on a downward trend and I feel like no one is talking about Covid here much. We have a new Republican Governor taking over next month, and I would be surprised if he came in guns blazing and locked everything down. I feel like there just isn't much of an appetite for it here. So I kinda see 2021 getting much more normal here. I could see some of the national chains like Costco keeping mask requirements, but I think most places will stop caring about masks. I think the knowledge that there is an "effective" vaccine available will make many people feel less obligated to go along with lockdowns. And once it gets warm in the spring, I think most people here will go back to normalcy. That's me being optimistic, and at this point nothing would really surprise me, but things are going the right direction where I live.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns will end (by popular demand)- the vaccine will finally give the “mushy middle” (who agree a lot more with us than the doomers) proper cover to say “enough is enough”. They aren’t following any of the restrictions anyway. </p>
<p>However, this will all be far too late to save us from economic ruin. The next decade or so (yes decade!) is going to be very very rough, and the poor will bear the brunt of it, as usual. Thank you liberals, for flushing your principles right down the toilet (if you ever had them to begin with). Sorry. Everyone else, save as much money as you can, and be conservative with spending. </p>
<p>The masks are the only thing I wonder about...they will probably stick around in certain areas/regions and venues for many many years. Unfortunately.</p>

        <p>I have no idea, at this point I just need hope. Seeing all this stuff that might happen makes me want to be put into an induced coma until it's over or Jesus comes whichever is first. I just can't take it anymore. I have a bf in Italy and if I can't see him, that relationship will probably end. I'm going crazy and I can't keep seeing the bleak future. I'm out of energy.</p>

        <p>This has been my prediction also. I feel that’s when there will be a large portion of people getting ticked off by all the restrictions. And then pretty much almost back to normal in Mid summer. This is my optimistic view, but if vaccine rollout is a botch, Fauci and like will keep pushing the narrative.</p>

        <p>I can't imagine it taking until the middle of summer for some kind of normalcy, not even complete normalcy, but then again, I can't believe it's gone on this long, or at all, for almost a freaking year. I'm ashamed that we as a human race let this go on for so long. We should have called bullshit from the beginning, with the very first restrictions. Even in March, when they said things in my state would close for two weeks, my first and only thought was "This is dumb as f#ck and I hope everyone rebels."</p>
