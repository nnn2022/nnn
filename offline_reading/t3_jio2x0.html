    <strong>Why are people encouraging and cheering the “new normal”?</strong>
    <p><p>I am on Facebook group with some of the students at my university and absolutely everyone is saying that we should adapt to the zoom clases because it is out new reality and even attack everyone that suggests the otherwise?</p>
<p>Why is everyone “excited” and cheering for restrictions like the ones in Wales, New Zeland and Victoria to stop a virus with a 99.7% survival rate?</p>
<p>Edit: The argument I keep seeing on this one is that millions will die if we let it spread like nothing but still not a single doomer model has become a reality so why do they not question this?</p>
<p>Why does everyone in /r/disneyparks cheers for the parks to stay close forever? Do they hate what they love?</p>
<p>Are we missing something? Are we on the wrong side of things?</p></p>

        <p>As a kid, I loved snow storms because it cancelled school. Now as an adult, I absolutely hate them because I can't drive anywhere.</p>
<p>Maybe they simply don't like in-person classes and find this to be a convenient excuse.</p>

<p>Step 1:  nobody listens to me because I’m a nobody</p>
<p>Step 2:  media pushes a topic, X</p>

        <p>Because they are lazy socialists.</p>
<p>They want to live an extended (or permanent) childhood where everything is provided for them, they don't have to work, and they don't have to get off of their couch, except to pay the Skip the Dishes guy.</p>
<p>They are more than happy to have government (and taxpayers) assume the caretaker role currently filled by their parents. UBI will replace the allowance from Mum and Dad. A layabout's paradise - until the money printing machines stop going "brrrrrrrr..."</p>
<p>Then they will be passed around as toys and slaves for the amusement of whatever Mad Max style overlords rise out of the collapse...</p>

        <p>It's virtue signalling. They feel like they are good people and morally superior by "saving lives" when they cheer on the controlled demolition of life pre-2020, a sacrifice they are more than willing to make.</p>

        <p>This is why the propaganda is so effective. People see it as in their self interest to loudly proclaim their loyalty to lockdown. The worst case scenario is they are simply wrong. If you oppose lockdown it gives ignoramuses the impression you don’t care about others. This means it’s not safe to accept you as a member of their tribe because you might act against the tribe’s interest. For this reason anti-lockdown people are forced to keep their mouth shut to not be ostracized. This makes people think we don’t exist or are an evil fringe group. No one wants to be thrown out of the tribe. In cave man days that could mean death.</p>

        <p>I reluctantly began considering these people already dead(or lost) a few months ago. The other user tinywightspider is correct about the ego. https://elysesantilli.com/differences-between-your-soul-and-your-ego/ Makes a great point about ego and "social masks", desperate need for validation from others.</p>
<p>I am praying for them for 7 months now, they would not listen to anything then, and surely will not listen now. It's up to them to wake up before they drag themselves and the entire world into an absolute living hell. (More so than it already was)</p>
<p>I disowned a lot of friends and family at this point, they would rather live in fear and call me names than be my friend or family. If being part of the club is more important than that, then they are neither friend/family to me either.</p>

<p>Sorry that had to happen to you, my brother/sister. Basically been in the exact same boat as you.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm a passenger on the Titanic with my loved ones trying to convince them that the ship, is in fact, sinkable and they castigate me for not "trusting the experts" despite their feet already being wet while plenty of the plebs down below deck are already drowning.</p>
<p>I may be praying for them, but I'm not letting myself get dragged down into Davy Jones Locker by the "unsinkable" RMS New Normal with them.</p>

        <p>Yeah don't let them drag you down! If they ever decide to think for a minute and figure out what's going on I'll help them out, but for now I'm just going to avoid them entirely. </p>
<p>It's like trying to have a conversation with talking heads on TV, because all they do is parrot the same crap they see on TV or read on their social media scrolls. The worst part is they assume I'm being 'manipulated' in a similar way to them... I watched that social dilemma doc; I was already well aware of the whole thing but my biggest takeaway was near the end, it showed me what other people assume about me. The end of that documentary really missed the mark, because by the end they are doing exactly what the whole doc was preaching AGAINST. lol</p>
<p>Breaking out of your 'filter-bubble' is not an easy task. Lots of tips out there and tools like privacytools.io to help people. I never had smart phone or facebook and I still have re-train search results almost every week.</p>

        <p>People are afraid; many are terrified. I know a few of them and they're convinced they or someone they care about will die if they get COVID-19. It doesn't matter whether their fears are valid because they are afraid and they're making decisions based on those fears.</p>
<p>Make people afraid, even a little bit, even in non-specific ways, and they'll do almost anything to make it end. Given them specific, life-ending fear and no action is too severe. The actions don't need to be effective, but they need to be proportional, not to the threat, but to size of their fear. This is an extremely dangerous situation as those afraid of losing their life or the life of their loved ones will not hesitate to threaten the lives of others if doing so appeals to cause of their fear.</p>
