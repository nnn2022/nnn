    <strong>The Lies They Sell: The End Of The Common Cold?</strong>
    <p><p>They've stopped thinking - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/10/gp-england-drop-common-cold-flu-cases-coronavirus-restrictions">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/10/gp-england-drop-common-cold-flu-cases-coronavirus-restrictions</a></p>
<p>“I think this is real and reflects two things: overwhelmingly the main thing is that social distancing and lockdown measures dramatically reduce the transmission of cold, influenza and other respiratory viruses,” said Paul Little, a professor of primary care research at the University of Southampton.</p>
<p>How does this clown even have a job? Professor my arse. Covid-19 is, by definition, a coronavirus and thus "the common cold". </p>
<p>Here's the lead story on Covid today in the same newspaper - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2021/jan/10/one-in-five-have-had-coronavirus-in-england-new-modelling-says">https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2021/jan/10/one-in-five-have-had-coronavirus-in-england-new-modelling-says</a>  </p>
<p>So, the common cold is gone due to social distancing and lockdowns? But the common cold has infected 12 million people too? </p>
<p>They've lost their fucking minds. This cannot under any circumstances be true. It is very clear that the real issue is that all forms of the common cold and the flu are now Covid-19 because the test is so super-sensitive that any viral infection will trigger it. </p>
<p>That a "professor of medicine" (what a joke) is unable to see that is horrific in the extreme.</p></p>

<p>Whenever you mix science with politics, we as the tax paying public lose.  There is no solid facts because nobody knows; and worse, the Pols don't want the people to know...</p>
