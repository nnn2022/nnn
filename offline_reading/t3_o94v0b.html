        <p>Well I've seen the same reporting of adverse reactions/deaths in Sinovac vaccines as we see in the western ones. If you read the articles they're very familiar in the sense that they downplay adverse reactions/deaths and say despite people dying shortly after the shot, they're unrelated to the vax. So it seems oddly familiar. That and they're ineffective as well (see articles below reporting many breakthrough cases). </p>
<p>Basically, we've never had any success in vaccinating against viruses, including the flu, why would it change all of a sudden?</p>
<p>"While the news that a 55-year-old woman died three days after receiving the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine have spread, Hung Fan Ngai Ivan, the head of the committee assessing clinical cases related to vaccines in Hong Kong, pointed out that the patient was a long-term sufferer of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and very likely died of acute stroke."</p>
<p>https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202103/1217638.shtml</p>
<p>"CHINA / SOCIETY - Serious adverse reactions of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine in HK are within the expected range: experts.
No evidence found to link deaths with vaccines: experts</p>
<p>A Hong Kong expert team said Monday that they deemed that the second death case in the city following vaccination of Sinovac vaccines was not related to the vaccine as the autopsy report showed that the cause of death of the recipient, a 55-year-old woman, was myocardial infarction and she had an aortic laceration. </p>
<p>The woman accepted the Sinovac vaccine on March 2 and died on Saturday from a stroke. An autopsy report showed that she had serious chronic disease like high blood pressure and high cholesterol, Ivan Hung Fan Ngai, a co-convener of the committee assessing clinical cases related to vaccines in Hong Kong, said at a press conference on Monday.  </p>
<p>As of 4 pm Saturday, 16 non-serious cases, like fever and headaches, and 45 other non-serious cases with susceptible adverse effects that need to be hospitalized have been reported to the authorities, Lam said.  </p>
<p>Two susceptible adverse effect cases have also been reported between March 6 and 8, with the two recipients still accepting treatment in the Intensive Care Department. But the experts decided that their symptoms were not caused by the vaccines after reviewing their materials, Hung said. </p>
<p>According to Hung, the first susceptible adverse effect case is an 80-year-old man who is currently in danger. He has diabetes and previously had a stroke. </p>
<p>The second case is a 72-year-old woman. Documents show that her symptoms are related to the suspension of insulin by herself, Lee Cheuk Kwong, another co-convener of the committee, said.</p>
<p>Another susceptible death has been reported on Monday - a 71-year-old man who accepted the first shot on March 3, Lee said, noting that the committee would review the information and decide the cause of the man's death after autopsy.</p>
<p>Hung noted that 4.4 million doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine have been administered worldwide with 56 deaths reported outside Hong Kong.   </p>
<p>Hong Kong will continue the vaccination program as planned following reports of some deaths and susceptible adverse effects. So far, no evidence was found to directly link the issues to the vaccination of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee said at another press conference on Monday.

<p>Articles on Sinovac being ineffective against covid:</p>
<p>"JAKARTA, June 17 (Reuters) - More than 350 Indonesian doctors and healthcare workers have contracted COVID-19 despite being vaccinated with Sinovac and dozens have been hospitalised, officials said, as concerns rise about the efficacy of some vaccines against more virulent virus variants."</p>

<p>"Chinaâ€™s Sinovac Vaccine Under Scrutiny As Covid Soars In Highly Vaccinated Countries"</p>

<p>"The small archipelago nation of Seychelles, northeast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, has emerged as the world's most vaccinated country for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Around 71 per cent of people have had at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, and 62 per cent have been fully vaccinated. Of these, 57 per cent have received the Sinopharm vaccine, and 43 per cent AstraZeneca.</p>
<p>Despite this, there has been a recent surge in cases, with 37 per cent of new active cases and 20 per cent of hospital cases being fully vaccinated. The country has had to reimpose some restrictions."</p>
