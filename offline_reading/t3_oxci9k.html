    <strong>Ugh, the school I go to finally did it...</strong>
    <p><p>They locked down the campuses around New Mexico due to the "dangerous Delta variant"...blah, blah, blah. Now masks are required for all campuses, and if you are not vaccinated, then the only time you are allowed to not have one on your face is when you are eating or drinking.</p>
<p>That kind of defeats the whole point, doesn't it? What if someone watched near me and sneezes when I was trying to eat. Yeah, that didn't do much at all for me "protection and safety." It's all just stupid nonsense. And vaccinated people apparently don't have to have one on their face if they are alone in a classroom or something like that.</p>
<p>Holy hell. I might not be able to even continue going to school if this keeps escalating like this.</p>
<p>I also got tons of screwed up propaganda and fearmongering (that's proven to be false. New Mexico hospitals ARE NOT AT CAPACITY, like they are telling me). But probably my favorite notice would probably be this:</p>
<p>&rt;If youâ€™re not vaccinated, please protect yourself, your family, our community, and young children who arenâ€™t eligible for the vaccine by getting vaccinated. More than 164 million Americans, 1 million &lt;citizens of my state&rt;, and 1.1 billion worldwide are fully vaccinated, but thatâ€™s not nearly enough to stop the pandemic. You can schedule your own appointment at a location near you.</p>
<p>ABSOLUTELY NOT. I AM NOT GETTING VACCINATED FOR THIS CHEAP LIE. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE PANDEMIC IS TO MOVE THE F*** ON.</p>
<p>And no, I'm not losing my immune system for a chance to win a 5 million dollar grand prize. New Mexico is hosting something called "Vax 2 the Max Sweepstakes" for chances to win money.</p>
<p>No thank you. My immune system is worth for more than anything anyone could ever give me. Besides, after you win, you'll get taxed on your winnings, and most of it goes to the federal and state governments, so what's the point? People are apparently winning 250k (<strong>TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND</strong>) every week, ll be left with like 140k after I get taxed.</p>
<p>I need to leave this state, yet I can't for personal reasons. Ugh.</p></p>

        <p>Itâ€™s actually CNM, but especially since Iâ€™m not getting a degree. Itâ€™s a certification. Some people think Iâ€™m weird for not wanting to get a degree, but Iâ€™m really just using school to hold myself from having to get a job, and hopefully Iâ€™ll get something valuable out of it</p>

        <p>Definitely don't blame you there. I got my degree and it was useless. Certifications are the way to go. Best of luck.</p>
