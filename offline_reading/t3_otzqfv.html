    <strong>Why the CDC is forcing people vaccinated people to wear a mask again</strong>
    <p><p>Short answer: It's because they're slowly figuring out that they completely fucked up.</p>
<p>Long answer:</p>
<p>Sometimes a poor antibody response to a virus is worse than no antibody response, because of a phenomenon called antibody dependent enhancement. Some antibodies bind to a virus without neutralizing the virus, which generally has the effect of making the infection worse, turning a mild disease into a severe one. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.640093/full">I quote:</a></p>
<p>&rt;Antibodies induced by vaccines can be neutralizing or non-neutralizing. Non-neutralizing antibodies can contribute to anti-viral activities with mechanisms including antibody-medicated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) [reviewed (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.640093/full#B73">73</a>)].</p>
<p>So, what we see with the vaccine is that the antibody response is of a much worse quality than the antibody response we see in people who survived a natural infection. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421007066">From another study</a></p>
<p>&rt;Polyclonal antibody responses in vaccinees were robust and comparable to or exceeded those seen after natural infection. However, the ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies after vaccination was greater than that after natural infection and, at the monoclonal level, we found that the majority of vaccine-induced antibodies did not have neutralizing activity.</p>
<p>So in natural survivors, most antibodies actually neutralizing the virus. In the vaccinated people, the ratio isn't just slightly worse, it's much worse. They have more than ten binding antibodies, for every neutralizing antibody. To make matters worse, it looks like the ratio grows worse over time, with neutralizing antibodies declining faster than the binding antibodies.</p>
<p>The dumbed down way I would explain it is as following:</p>
<p>&rt;They made a shitty vaccine. Your body is equipped with a very wide range of different tactics that it uses, to protect your body against various bugs that try to infect it. Because your body uses such a wide range of different tactics, it's generally hard for a bug to show up a second time and infect you again.</p>
<p>&rt;What the vaccine manufacturers unfortunately did was inject a very small part of this virus into your bloodstream, thereby forcing your body to learn to deal with this virus in a very narrow specific way, leaving your immune system unable to use all the different tools that it normally learns to deploy against a virus when it is exposed to the virus in a normal manner. When the virus then discovers through mutation to overcome that very narrow specific way of dealing with it, your body is basically stuck with that now useless response that it was forced to learn.</p>
<p>There are two different processes happening now simultaneously. On the one hand, the antibody response is declining in the vaccinated people. The way to obscure the poor quality of the immune response, is by increasing the quantity of the immune response. You can still win a war against an enemy while you're using worse weapons, simply by throwing a lot of manpower at the battle. As the antibody response declines over time, it ceases to work.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, there is another process happening. Because the body was taught to attack the virus in a very specific narrow manner, by focusing on a very small part of the virus, the virus rapidly becomes more potent, simply through very small changes in its spike protein. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250780">Studies now show that a small number of mutations to a handful of amino acids are enough to completely evade the immune response:</a></p>
<p>&rt;Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to vaccines or other prophylactics that rely on one or two antibodies for protection can develop quickly -and repeatedly- under positive selection.</p>
<p>Most of the amino acid chains that make up this virus look very similar to those found in the proteins your own body produces in the type of cells that this virus tends to infect. That's why your body is forced to rely on a small number of places where the virus does look different from the amino acid chains in your own proteins.</p>
<p>If you survived a natural infection, your immune system has a broader range of proteins to target. With the spike protein based vaccines, your immune system is taught to focus entirely on figuring out a few places in the spike protein that it can target that don't look similar to places in the proteins your own body produces. That works reasonably well, until the virus mutates and those select few places in the spike protein have changed.</p>
<p>We can look at the British data, because the British are keeping pretty close track of all the mutations that are showing up. What we see there is that in recent weeks, a whole bunch of mutations are rapidly becoming more common. Generally those seem to be mutations that make a subtle change to the spike protein, so that the antibodies from vaccinated people no longer work against the virus.</p>
<p>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005517/Technical_Briefing_19.pdf</p>
<p>You can scroll down to page 42 and see the mutations that are becoming more common. Compare the frequency of mutations in the last two tables, look at the ones that are rapidly becoming more common. You will see examples like P251L, which is a mutation in the spike protein that allows the virus to escape an antibody.</p>
<p>There's plenty of evidence that we have now, that suggests the vaccine is not delivering the protection we need. The big canaries in the coal mine are places like the United Kingdom and Israel where the vaccination campaigns began first,  particularly the United Kingdom, because it's internationally well connected and has a larger population than Israel, so new variants will show up there quite rapidly.</p>
<p>There's a third factor to consider, which will also contribute to make this situation worse. The spike based vaccines were mostly deployed in Europe and North America, places with a very seasonal climate. It's rare for people to get infected with this virus here during the summer. As we enter fall, conditions change and it becomes easier for the virus to spread again. With more infections, the virus has more opportunities to mutate, which means the speed at which it learns to overcome the immune response increases too.</p>
<p>Israel has now apparently stopped publishing data on the percentage of hospitalized patients who were vaccinated. The most recent data we have showed no real difference in chances of infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated Israeli citizens.</p>
<p>If you look at Scotland, you will see that ICU admissions for COVID19 are currently at a level that they normally see in winter, roughly half of the peak they had in january. That's not what you would expect if 90% of the at-risk demographic has been fully vaccinated and this vaccine is genuinely effective.</p>
<p>Pfizer wants to start giving people a third injection and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/pfizer/status/1420474141686255624">they're now also starting to work on oral therapies that will treat people.</a> Why would they start those trials now, if we're more than a year into the pandemic and most people in the developed world are now vaccinated?</p>
<p>If it's true that the vaccine doesn't work and merely makes the disease worse, this wouldn't be the first example. This happened before, with an experimental RSV vaccine given to children in the 1960's. The vaccine caused antibody dependent enhancement and children died as a result, the experiment was then rapidly halted.</p>
<p>So, all the evidence we have currently suggest that the vaccines are going to make the situation worse. This also fits what we see when we look at hospitalizations in the canary in the coal mine, England. They have far more hospitalizations right now than they did a year ago for the virus, even though a lot of people should have natural immunity by now. If this is going to unfold the way it currently appears, the people who would be worst off are those people in high risk demographics who have never been exposed to the virus before receiving the vaccine.</p>
<p>The CDC's message was originally that vaccinated people don't have to wear masks. Now they suddenly changed their minds and vaccinated people are expected to start wearing masks again, as the third booster is being prepared. That's an indicator that they changed their minds. It looks like they're starting to figure out that they made a big mistake.</p></p>

        <p>I make a point to always call it the "covid shot" because it isn't a vaccine. Words mean things, and as soon as people start changing their definitions to sell you a product it should raise an immediate red flag. For more information on how this works look into neuro linguistic programming (nlp). Some other examples besides "you won't get the covid vaccine, you're an anti-vaxxer!!"</p>
<p>Cuomo's SAFE act. The Patriot Act. Pro choice vs Pro life. </p>
<p>If you use the right words/acronyms, you can subtly imply anyone against a bill/movement/action is also against things like safety, patriotism, life etc etc. </p>
<p>Behavioral analysts are hired by the govt to go all out with these subtle methods in the public sector, the same way it's been pushed in the private sector since Edward Bernays' time with his "torches for freedom" campaign that got women to smoke cigarettes.</p>

        <p>MISINFORMATION ALERT.</p>
<p>Technically the mrna is used to create the spike protein, but otherwise this is exactly how they work, you're exposed to only a small portion of the virus you're trying to learn to defeat.</p>
<p>Also, the IFR of covid is around that of the flu, and for delta it's FAR LOWER (UK and US docs put the CFR at 0.1%, which is already below the flu, and the IFR &lt; CFR).</p>

        <p>nice quality study, which after completing its attempt at a scientific conclusion, decides they're all wrong and the meta analysis was useless:  "Given issues with mortality recording, it is also likely that this represents an underestimate of the true IFR figure."  In technical terms, this is called a bias :)</p>
<p>IFR is also not consistent across variants, and has a MUCH LOWER CFR from recent reports:</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oiu39k/delta_variant_02_fatality_rate_official_document/</p>
<p>(This is of course HIGHER for vaccinated and lower for unvaccinated:</p>
<p>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/994997/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_16.pdf</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>And flu has had vaccines in circulation for years.</p>
<p>Fortunately, since we know that states and countries are vastly overreporting deaths by including anyone who had a recent positive test, or might have had covid but weren't tested (the vaers data hilariously includes vaccinated patients with negative tests as covid deaths) , the IFR is actually lower than these estimates.  add to that the fact that PCR is not medically diagnostic and the "gold standard" that the CDC is scrapping makes death determination via such protocols impossible, and the mortality counts and calculations a bit of a joke.</p>

        <p>CFR is irrelevant here and also misleading, because definition of "case" is changing with availability of testing.</p>
<p>CDC is not scrapping PCR tests, just replacing one test kit with the other. PCR still remains gold standard, a positive result still means the subject either has SARS-CoV-2, or had it pretty recently (within a week or so).</p>
<p>We know that countries are not vastly overreporting COVID-19 deaths because those closely match excess mortality.</p>

        <p>So what it is designed to do?</p>
<p>Because all that I've seen the PCR test "doing" is drag the planet down to hysteria, create hypochondriacs that are afraid to breathe, and give governments a way to move towards totalitarianism under the applause of people who have either never listened to a history class or prefer to let "others" think for them.</p>
<p>The PCR test might very well be a very good test for a certain type of testing, but unfortunately the PCR test is to "blame", since it was what the governments and media waved in our faces, for over a year of overinflated numbers, the illusion that someone can be infected while showing zero signs, and a perfect excuse to say that someone who died falling off a ladder "Died of COVID".</p>
<p>I get what you are saying, I truly do. The PCR test was designed for one type of testing, and the asshats decide to use it as a tool to make the world as it is currently. But unfortunately the term "PCR test(ing)" is going to leave a bad taste in most peoples mouth down the line just as it is "shocking" to Westerners who visit Asia when they see a swastika on a Buddhist or Hindu temple.</p>

        <p>PCR test is designed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the sample, and does it well.</p>
<p>This can be because the person tested has COVID-19, because the person <em>had</em> COVID-19 recently and recovered, that the person was infected with SARS-CoV-2 and was spreading it without having COVID-19 symptoms, or that someone contaminated the sample.</p>
<p>Not enough people falling off ladders are being labeled as "dead from COVID" to move the needle. You can compare confirmed COVID-related deaths with excess mortality, there's a pretty good match.</p>

        <p>They shouldn't call it a "COVID test", as it isn't testing for a disease. It isn't even testing for a full, or functioning virus particle. They should call it "a test that could potentially show a positive result for the presence a partial viral particle, or a non functioning viral particle, after a dirty genetic sample has been amplified billions of times".

        <p>“With PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody.  It starts making you believe, in sort of the Buddhist notion, that everything is contained in everything else, right?  I mean, if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really measure, which PCR can do, then there’s just very few molecules that you don’t have at least one single one of them in your body, okay.  So that could be thought of as a misuse, just to claim that it’s meaningful.”</p>
<p>“Those tests are all based on things that are invisible and the results are inferred in a sense.  PCR as separate from that... is just a process that’s used to make a whole lot of something out of something. That’s what it is.  It doesn’t tell you that you’re sick and it doesn’t tell you that the thing you ended up with was going to hurt you or anything like that.”</p>

        <p>&rt; CFR is ...misleading</p>
<p>IFR and CFR are both bound by sampling biases and errors.  IFR is also affected by modeling mistakes.  Hospitalizations and deaths are influenced by testing protocols and even whether people come in with covid or are found with it after (some 56% in the UK).  They're both poor measures, but they're all we have to work with, and IFR is always lower than CFR because we are able to sample most of the deaths but only guess at which mild cases we're missing.</p>
<p>&rt; PCR still remains gold standard, a positive result still means the subject either has SARS-CoV-2, or had it pretty recently (within a week or so).</p>
<p>BUNK.  Complete and utter garbage.  Go consult a freshman bio textbook (I have many in my office I can lend you!), this isn't what PCR does, how it works, even if you control for cycle count, which is not being reported.  You can be PCR positive and never sick (or immune from previous illness/vaccine) and you can be sick and test positive for weeks and weeks afterwards.  (And, of course, the virus isn't the disease.  You can "have sars-cov-2" in or on your body or nasal mucous and not be sick, thus not have covid.  If you aren't sick, you aren't diseased, thus not a 'case' of covid.)</p>
<p>Once you finish the bio textbook, go find the actual corman-drosten PCR protocol and the critiques of it.  They're not even using PCR correctly, there are several mistakes and poor choices in that protocol alone, not to mention the lack of peer review of the protocol before adoption.</p>
<p>It has been well known for months that PCR is being used incorrectly and vastly overstates cases, both fatal and mild.  It's an amazing tool, but only confirmatory for diagnoses, never for diagnosing on its own.</p>
<p>BTW, since excess mortality is your gauge, we're absolutely overcounting covid deaths.  For the US (2020), just for starters:</p>
<p>&rt; Not just that, fatalities by heart disease up from 660k to 690k. Deaths from stroke up from 150k to 159k. Deaths from Alzheimer's up from 121k to 133k. Diabetes saw an increase from 87k to 101k. 
&rt; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778234</p>
<p>There are MANY other contributers to increased excess mortality, so covid counts matching that number means they're overcounting.</p>

        <p>Again, utter nonsense.  You can have sc2 fragments in/on you and never have been sick, been immune from a previous exposure, or had a mild case and died from cancer-&rt;pneumonia.  This isn't how medical diagnosis is done, period, they really prefer to establish cause of death, not just what myriad diseases you had in your body when you died.</p>
<p>Simply, the presence of sars-cov-2 fragments don't mean you have or had covid, nor can they inform as to the recency of an exposure.  Period.</p>

We literally have health officials stating they're counting people not killed by covid as covid deaths.  We have local audits showing 50% of reported deaths clearly weren't caused by covid.

        <p>Do the math. There are about 30 thousand fatal vehicle accidents per year. 25% of that is 7.5k. Compare to the number of COVID-19 deaths, or even to half of that number. They're not on the same order of magnitude.</p>

<p>There are clearly other plausible explanations for excess mortality.  These are just a few, a previous post had others.  You're being intentionally obtuse.</p>

        <p>As soon as you do the math and tell me how many of those recorded covid19 deaths were just states recording "death with covid" or "covid diagnosis based purely on faulty pcr" i'll add up the other major causes of death to see how many of those excess deaths are attributable to other causes, and we'll see how far in the middle we meet.  Then we'll know how many deaths are actually caused by those losses of freedom you so embrace, and not the disease you were told you were fighting!</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, the famous "meet in the middle" trick, Y U no compromise. I'm telling you that your estimate (that you pulled from thin air) is wrong, and instead of looking at the data you begin to haggle.</p>
<p>If you have made up your mind to such extent that you don't even want to look at the data, nothing I can say matters.</p>

        <p>You're confused again.  Some 600k excess deaths, we know some of those counted weren't covid (as stated by state health administrators), and we know some were increased heart disease, stroke, diabetes, auto accidents, crime, drug ODs, etc. (Each are simple counter arguments to your weak "no other explanation" claim)  If we add those up, we should reach the same number of false covid reports.  One MN audit found something like 40% were falsely attributed to covid, so naively extrapolating that the number in the middle would be 240k of the 600k were incorrect, and this should be verifiable with other fatality data, assuming the excess mortality is actually correct.</p>
<p>I bring only data to this discussion, you bring whining and "Y U no compromise."</p>
<p>You can go now, you don't have anything valuable to add.</p>

        <p>They shouldn't call it a "COVID test", as it isn't testing for a disease. It isn't even testing for a full, or functioning virus particle. They should call it "a test that could potentially show a positive result for the presence a partial viral particle, or a non functioning viral particle, after a dirty genetic sample has been amplified billions of times".

<p>The PCR method was originally developed to find trace DNA in ancient artifacts, it was never designed as a diagnostic tool. https://archive.is/frrVs</p>
<p>Dr. Kary Mullis would hate to see how his PCR technique was shoehorning another epidemic.</p>
<p>Mullis was critical of Fauci in the past.</p>
<p>Mullis died of “pneumonia” 3 days before Epstein.</p>
<p>2009: Kary Mullis' next-gen cure for killer infection https://archive.is/gbnRN</p>
<p>Mullis described the redirection of an existing immune response to a new pathogen.</p>
<p>Mullis on HIV:</p>
<p>“The number of cases went up epidemically, you know, exponentially.  Because the number of tests that were done went up exponentially.”</p>
<p>“How much money did we make off of HIV this year?... It’s an epidemic because we’re making more and more money off of it every year.”</p>
