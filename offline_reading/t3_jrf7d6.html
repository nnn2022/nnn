    <p><p>“The movements of expression in the face and body, whatever their origin may have been are in themselves of much importance for our welfare. They serve as the first means of communication between a mother and her infant. She smiles approval and thus encourages her child on the right path, or frowns disapproval. We readily perceive sympathy in others by their expression. </p>
<p>Our sufferings are thus mitigated and our pleasures increased, and mutual good feeling is thus strengthened. </p>
<p>The movements of expression give vividness and energy to our spoken word. They reveal the thoughts and intentions of others more truly than do words, which may be falsified… </p>
<p>The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it. On the other hand, the repression - as far as this is possible - of all outward signs softens our emotions. He who gives way to violent gestures will increase his rage. He who does not control the signs of fear will experience fear in a greater degree. And he who remains passive when overwhelmed with grief, looses his best chance of recovering elasticity of mind. </p>
<p>These results follow partly from the intimate relation which exist between almost all the emotions and their outward manifestations and partly from the direct influence of exertion of the heart and consequently on the brain. Even the simulation of an emotion tends to arouse it in our minds.” </p>
<p><strong>- Charles Darwin,</strong> <strong><em>The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals</em></strong></p></p>

        <p>I've noticed when talking to people, how the conversation is much more stilted and awkward when either of us are wearing masks. When ordering coffee with a mask on the conversation doesn't flow the same, it picks up when we take the masks off.</p>
<p>There's definitely something about seeing someone's face that's friendly. A mask is a wall, it's a barrier preventing friendship.</p>

        <p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>I think about how light my heart feels when I see my little nephews laugh, how euphoric I feel after a lively dinner with friends, or how twitterpated I feel from a flirtatious passing side-smile from a stranger. These things are so important to our very humanity and well-being. I know I’m not the only one who feels a deep emptiness from the lack of this. </p>
<p>Humans show support and interest in one another with the subconscious mimicking of expression. It is important! Hell, have you ever watched a clip of Friends without the laugh track? Yiiiikes.</p>
