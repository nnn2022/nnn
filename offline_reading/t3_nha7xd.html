    <strong>Need some advice. Don’t know what to do</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys- I wanted to come here and ask for advice, since of all people, you guys seem to know how bad this is going to get. I’m a 19 year old female and graduated high school in 2020. I have taken the year off of school due to the pandemic- I will NOT pay an institution to lock me in a jail cell for a year and sit and watch zoom classes. I work two jobs right now, and now in my state we are lifting mask mandates for those vaccinated. This is very concerning to me, as now my employers are starting to give me shit for not being vaccinated and I’m very scared for where this is going. This especially concerns me for when the fall rolls around and people are obviously going to be dying again, due to the vaccine or some new covid-21 that they blame the unvaccinated for. </p>
<p>What’s funny is that even though the mask mandate is now lifted, 99% of customers are still wearing the fucking muzzles... everyone’s a sheep.</p>
<p>I have coworkers who are refusing to get the vaccine, but I feel as though none of them understand the extent of how bad it’s going to get in the future with government control.</p>
<p>So here is my question- should I even go to college in the fall or should I wait another semester to see how things play out? should I move down to Texas or Florida and go to college there? Should I even go to college anytime in the near future? By the way, I will never get the vaccine, so that is off the table.</p>
<p>Super concerned for the future and unsure what to do. What are your thoughts? Thank you guys in advance.</p></p>

        <p>First of all, congratulations for having your head screwed on right. </p>
<p>Personally - and I graduated college years ago, but with a marketable degree, in mathematics - I think any parent who sends their kid to college during this lunacy is guilty of child abuse. I don't know which colleges you're looking at, but I've heard firsthand stories of kids being expelled for posing on Instagram without masks, among other things. So at the absolute least, don't go to a college that's going to treat you like a prisoner and punish you for ridiculous infractions. (And even prisoners don't <em>pay</em> for the privilege of going to prison.) </p>
<p>If you're going to study chemistry or engineering or something, find a college that'll treat you like a human and not make you wear a mask. Even if it's out-of-state. But it looks like you could claim residency wherever it's most suitable. </p>
<p>That being said, do you even really need to go to a 4-year indoctrination factory anyway? I have a friend slightly older than you, smart guy, could've gone to any college he wanted. He looked at tuition prices and thought "Do I really want to defer earning money for 4 years?" Instead he spent a few hundred bucks getting his commercial driver's license. Long story short, he now makes six figures a year and is carrying zero student loan debt. </p>
<p>It doesn't have to be commercial driving. Learn CNC. Hawk real estate. Whatever you do, take the time to figure out if going to college will pencil out for you. For the vast majority of people, it doesn't. Add the recent turn to totalitarianism on college campuses and it's a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Stay safe (meaning unvaccinated), trust in God, and avoid stupid decisions. Good luck.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I’ve always hated school, always loved working. I like high energy and being on my feet. I want to perhaps own my own business one day- I would need a business degree for this, right? I don’t like sitting in a classroom having to take bullshit classes, where I just spit back useless information on the exam that I will never need. This is where I am perplexed.. I feel as though college is learning how to make others rich. I don’t need college to learn this. Would love to own my own restaurant/bar one day, because I love the energy and fast decision making. Unsure what to do here.. any thoughts?</p>

        <p>You so don't need a business degree to own a business. </p>
<p>If you want to own a restaurant or bar, I'd start by not only working in one, but making yourself as valuable as possible to the owner. </p>
<p>Anyone can sling drinks or serve food. Once you've established yourself as a good worker, it can be as simple as telling the manager or the owner, "I want to know more about the industry. I want to know how to order supplies. How to do the books. How licensing works." The vast majority of 19-year-old restaurant workers care about nothing more than cash tips and free food. Set yourself apart.</p>

        <p>You've got a good head on your shoulders. Keep trusting your instincts. You don't need any degree to run a business - that's propaganda from universities and the like. If you like being on your feet and you want to own a business one day, sales is always good - and you can make a lot of money if you put in work. Without a degree, you'll probably be looking at one with a lower salary, but higher commission structure. Most people's perception of sales is not really how it is, I mean that in a good way. Feel free to DM anytime if you want more info.</p>

        <p>do you have any suggestions? I love high pressure and being on my feet.. I work in a restaurant and a grocery store, sometimes 13 hours a day, double shifts. Love constantly moving and making fast decisions, and talking to people, if this helps. I want to try to find a job behind the bar somewhere, which is also quick decisions.</p>

        <p>only you can make that decision, but I can tell you if I had the opportunity I would certainly move to Texas or Florida in a heartbeat right now.  I never paid much attention to american politics in the past (I'm in Canada), but seeing how they have handled this shit show and the leadership they have there has been eye opening.  Things may not be perfect there, but it is certainly better than most of the other states and Canada!</p>

        <p>I'd take a hard look in the mirror and ask what your goals are with regard to college. If you have actual career goals, which college would help you achieve, I'd say it's worth it to move somewhere like you mentioned where freedom reigns. But I wouldn't waste time going to college for some gimmicky general studies or miscellaneous nonsense, especially in today's video learning culture.</p>
<p>Your job, well, if you can keep kicking ass and saving up then more power to you. Just be sure you can afford the move. Way to go on working 2 jobs and making it happen. You seem like you have a head on your shoulders and I would assume you know what you want. Like the other person said, trust your instinct.</p>

        <p>A lot of very important and very intelligent people are fighting the same battle as us so don't think you're alone. We obviously don't hear about these unless we go looking specifically. Reiner Fuellmich and Dolores Cahill are two good ones to start with. </p>
<p>In terms of your rights (I assume you're in US), Jeff Witzeman has great info on what you can and can't be forced to do. </p>
<p>For what it's worth I would say unless it's physically impossible don't put your studies on hold if you don't want to. We have all already sacrificed enough of our civil rights, fuck them.</p>

        <p>I went to a junior college out of high school. Dropped out after a couple semesters. Had some pretty shitty job opportunities after that. Nothing ever went well for me career wise even though I always worked hard.Went back a decade later and finished my degree. Only got an associates but it opened a lot of doors for me and taught me a lot of great skills.</p>
<p>I think you should give college a try. Find away around the bullshit vaxx requirements. Religious exemption...whatever it takes. I think the vaxx mandates are all scare tactics since its only got emergency approval. I think a lot the vaxx requirements will disappear soon, maybe after lawsuit threats</p>
<p>Edit: also congrats on keeping your head straight. I'm convinced this will be a dark spot in the history of the US. Your on the right side of history no matter what the MSM says</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing your own story. Very interesting. my father never went to college, he said he always regretted it. my mother got her masters, she said it has always helped her. I will look into a trade or possibly associate degrees that aren’t too expensive. Thank you for the advice</p>

        <p>I should also note it's partly my fault for not succeeding without a degree. I would land a shitty job and then stay there for a couple years even though I knew there was no future for me at that particular place. Once something put me over the edge,, I would then seek new employment. I got more motivated once I had my associates. I think it gave me confidence that I was worth more and expected more.</p>

        <p>College was useless before the pandemic, unless you had a really specific career path in mind that required certain levels of accreditation.</p>
<p>If you wanted to go and major in Theater or English or Women's Studies or something like that - don't do that to yourself. Just go pursue those careers. </p>
<p>If you want to be a doctor or lawyer or something like that - maybe think about doing it.</p>

        <p>College will always be there - and you don’t need to get a degree to own and operate your own business.</p>
<p>I’d start by taking community college courses for some basics that you’re interested in. Much more affordable and flexible with less of a commitment.</p>
<p>Keep doing what you’re doing and regardless if you move or not, connect with people in your community. Talk to business or restaurant owners about their experiences and shadow them. Perhaps you’ll find some like minded folks out there along the way.</p>

        <p>I’m 34 and was a business owner (salon) for almost 10 years prior to this. I also graduated with honors from a top university (before I got my cosmetology license).</p>
<p>You are young, already working two jobs. You are clearly an intelligent woman and willing to work hard. </p>
<p>If I were in your shoes I would skip college (it’s a joke, honestly) absolutely move to Florida or Texas, as they are open and business friendly states (I would choose Florida because it’s pretty and I have family there).</p>
<p>Use your youthful energy to have fun, work hard, make good financial decisions (and stay out of legal trouble!!) save money and keep your credit good. You could totally open your own restaurant. Running a business is rewarding and fulfilling work.</p>
<p>Dream big and go for it. Ignore haters. Your life is YOURS and you are way too young to let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>

        <p>My mom is trying to get me to make plans regarding the future of her house. I told her, I don't even know if any of us are going to be free or alive, etc in a few years. College is not what it used to be. It used to be a guarantee of a good paying job. It's just not like that anymore. Most of my college graduate friends are working entry level jobs or have their own small business unrelated to their major. The ones that are doing very bad are ones that are taking a pay cut just to use their degree.</p>
<p>Now, if you know you want to be a doctor or lawyer, there's only 1 way to get that done and that's lots of secondary education. But if you aren't really sure and you're gonna be playing musical majors, I'd give college a second thought. </p>
<p>It's hard to make these types of decisions as if everything is normal. I definitely wouldn't do it if they are going to make you sacrifice yourself to them with the vaccine or something else they present to the world in a yr from now.</p>
