        <p>It’s odd that this author blames the development of potentially dangerous mutations on social distancing, when everything I’ve read about the notion indicates that such mutations have been the result of immunocompromised people being ill for a very long time, or antibody treatments that force the virus to mutate in strange ways. She pretends that a low amount of sick people are causing the virus to adapt and become more transmissible, when there are hundreds of thousands of new cases every day all around the world— that seems like plenty of circulation.</p>

        <p>None of those diseases were "destroyed". They still exist, although their rate of transmission is reduced, allegedly due to vaccines, but in great part due to an immense improvement in overall sanitary conditions. That being said, we didn't put everything on hold in the fight against the infections you mentioned. So why do it with COVID?</p>

        <p>Could be argued that those were devastating diseases that ran rampant before the era of “modern medicine” where we generally have a much better grasp of science, treatments and prevention. The fact Covid was blowing up hospitals around the world this time last year (still is in places) with all the tools we now have at our disposal was a big reason behind all the panic and the harsh measures that followed. We put shit on hold to figure out wtf was going on, but even a year later there aren’t really viable treatments widely used yet, and the sketchy vaccines seem to be the closest thing to a prophylactic. We’re starting to learn that a lot of people across age brackets will have debilitating problems post-infection (as happened with SARS). Hell, we still don’t know if it’s a human-altered “gain of function” experiment that may have escaped from a Chinese lab or not. </p>
<p>I aim to view the situation seriously while also acknowledging lockdowns are devastating and the situation sucks no matter what we really do. I do find it hard to resign myself to the “let’s just force-return to normal and see what happens” crowd tho.</p>

        <p>"The fact Covid was blowing up hospitals around the world"</p>
<p>See, this is what happens when you drink all the propaganda uncritically: COVID was not blowing up more than the common flu in previous years. Loads of doctors and nurses have come out to say precisely that and also that they have a lot less patients these days (as you can tell from the tik tok videos). So yes, the measures were disproportionate. </p>
<p>"We put shit on hold to figure out wtf was going on, but even a year later there aren’t really viable treatments widely used yet, and the sketchy vaccines seem to be the closest thing to a prophylactic."</p>
<p>Er... no. You can't put things on hold if that leads to a total death toll (not COVID related) that is way higher than that of COVID alone + unprecedented poverty for those who survive. </p>
<p>"We’re starting to learn that a lot of people across age brackets will have debilitating problems post-infection"</p>
<p>All infections lead to complications in some people. It might not be wildly publicised, but they do. </p>
<p>&rt;Hell, we still don’t know if it’s a human-altered “gain of function” experiment that may have escaped from a Chinese lab or not.</p>
<p>Maybe. Still doesn't change the management in this case. </p>
<p>&rt;I do find it hard to resign myself to the “let’s just force-return to normal and see what happens” crowd tho.</p>
<p>You might feel better having the sensation you're being proactive, but ultimately you need to do a cost-benefit analysis, and to "not do anything" might really be the way to go, particularly with such a low death rate. In any case, hospitals would still be providing supportive treatment even if there were no lockdowns, masks, etc. It's not a "we don't care about you" attitude.</p>

        <p>Smallpox is an exception, but it's definitely the exception and not the rule. It's eradicated in the wild - and it had a IFR over 30%, which justifies lots of effort trying to get rid of it. For something with fast mutations and IFR close to the range of annual seasonal flu, attempting eradication is a waste of time and money and will probably never work anyway.</p>
<p>I'm mad about the relative lack of research into treatments. Governments have been throwing billions at vaccines, which even in the reasonable best-case scenario would only be partially effective, instead of figuring out how best to use medications to treat symptoms and prevent mild cases from getting serious. "Health" organizations dropped the ball. India seems to have done pretty well with cheap medication kits enhanced with zinc. We could have used something similar and improved on it with vitamin D, and continued research to see what further improvements could be made, different med combos and dose adjustments, etc. But no, that would have made fewer pharma execs' friends rich. Even though I don't think any reasonable person would complain too much if Pfizer or somebody put together a kit worth $10 and marked it up to $25.</p>

        <p>When you come to terms with the fact that the year long Covid Marketing Campaign was planned to increase vaccine uptake and push towards mandatory vaccination it all makes sense.  </p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies have entrenched a long list of child hood vaccinations but needed to make headway into the adult market. Vaccination passports give them full control.</p>
<p>Governments also wanted more control over their populace. Now they manage every minute of our lives to "stop the spread'</p>
