        <p>Not really, this happened in the UK where a higher percentage of people are vaccinated and where the population is much smaller.   Also the US is not the world and I am tired of people acting like it is.    Not everything the US does is right or even smart.    The US makes tons of mistakes and it's not like our citizens are all brilliant either.    We have plenty of idiots in government and even more in the general population.    Stop listening to shit the US has to say... we don't know shit. </p>
<p>Also my niece in the UK actually has covid right now, she was working from home and always wore a mask, socially distanced, did everything correctly and waited until restrictions were lifted before going out but some selfish fuck went out while sick and she ended up getting it.    </p>
<p>As long as assholes who are sick k eep going out in public without caring if they are going to infect others because it's "not a big deal" or "just a cold" this is going to keep happening.    And my niece is only 19 but she is terribly ill and I can't go visit her because I'm stuck in the US.</p>
