    <strong>Does it still surprise you as to who continues to believe this? Friends, Family, Coworkers, ect?</strong>
    <p><p>For the first time in a about 3 months I met up with a friend today. It was nice weather after a long while of unbearable cold and snow.</p>
<p>I expressed to him that this had felt like a drug. That no amount of netflix / online communication can replace real human interaction. He agreed entirely. He's not someone that is actively skeptical but is certainly open to spotting the inconsistencies, fear mongering, and motives behind what's really going on.</p>
<p>When I get home - I messaged another buddy of mine that I hadn't spoken to since the summer. I let him know that I am attempting to reconnect with people because I am going to actively try to make plans with people who I've lost touch with after this whole thing hit....</p>
<p>Well... We got to talking and although he was glad to hear from me and of course the Covid conversation got brought up. His hard time dealing with this lockdown, not being able to hang out with his buddies, ect. I said "Yeah, time to move to a state where the restrictions aren't so tough and you can really live life again".</p>
<p>Oh boy. That pissed him off. "The death rates in those states are lower because people go there to vacation but then they come home and DIE. Why don't people get this?". It instantly made me cross him off the list. I can't deal with the paranoid nature. Just can't do it. There's been enough gaslighting and guilt tripping - we're done with it now. I won't have it done to me by people I know.</p>
<p>It's wild because I've known this guy for a while. He was very open minded from what I've known of him, has been through hard times which ultimately fosters healthy skepticism in people... but this reaction just brought me back down again, like - "Fuck. You got lucky with that one friend but most people aren't as cool as him". What this has done to friends, family, and others is just awful.</p></p>

        <p>That is the dumbest argument ever. If people are going to the open states and then going home and dying, what about the people that live there? That still doesn't actually explain the low death rates in those states. Because if simply visiting kills you, then how would living there not kill you? What a moron.</p>

        <p>I think one of the worst aspects of this is the damage that these "experts" have done to the social fabric in terms of breaking up friends etc. and turning strangers into dangerous villains.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's too bad but if they are that panicked, then it's not worth it. You'll just continue to breed resentment for the guy every time he says stuff like that. </p>
<p>Life is better off without these people.</p>

        <p>Last March my ex girlfriend (gf at the time) told me that this virus is overblown and was making fun of people like how we make fun of people now. I saw her SC story a few weeks ago and she’s full blown sheep. Healthy young woman who gets the vaccine as soon as it was available, criticizing others who don’t want to get the vaccine or people who don’t double mask etc. it’s crazy.</p>
