    <strong>Evidence is not good enough for the sheep.</strong>
    <p><p>I have noticed that people who were willing to put in a mask because some talking head on the TV told them to are not willing to take them off when proven ineffective. My mom is a super sheep. She learned, from the tv, that one mask wouldn't protect you (doesn't matter that I have said this the whole time) so she wants to double mask. I told her that even the "experts" are now against lockdowns and she is still scared to go out. It seems that they have enough authority to give people fear but not enough to tell them to stop fearing. People won't think for themselves but they also won't listen when you try to show them the inconsistencies.</p></p>
