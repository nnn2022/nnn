        <p>I dont know about vaccines but to get a drug that actually works to market is about 10 year and 1 billion dollars.</p>
<p>I can only imagine that it being a new vaccine and a completely new technology would cost more in time and money. And the patent protection is ticking away.</p>
<p>Moderna got soooo lucky.  1.  The government paid for a lot of that 2. It gives them 9 years of "extra" patent protection.   3.  Zero liability if crashes and burns.  Once this is officially approved the whole technology is approved.  That means every similar vaccine is waved.  Every novel vaccine  has an easier time getting approved. </p>
<p>This just fell in their lap.  This kind of luck is trillions to 1.</p>

        <p>imagine how dumb people will feel if the FDA ends up not approving the vaccine. i feel like this can‚Äôt happen because people would get mad they got tricked into dangerous drugs and there would be riots.</p>
<p>safe or not safe, this vaccine will get FDA approved.</p>

        <p>Documents filed by Moderna Therapeutics to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 6, 2020 explain some of the risks in marketing a mRNA drug. They also explain why it may take longer than the estimated study completion date. Moderna states <strong>‚ÄúAs a potential new class of medicines, no mRNA medicines have been approved to date by the FDA or other regulatory agency.</strong>..Prior to the Phase 3 trial for mRNA-1273 and that of one other company, <strong>there had never been a Phase 3 trial in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient, and there has never been and there may never be a commercialized product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient...</strong>Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism. In addition, because <strong>no product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient has been approved, the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain.</strong>‚Äù</p>

        <p>Personally I think biomedical research is awesome and obviously they should keep trying. But I also hate fascists and monopolists who indirectly force treatments on people as a condition of their normal existence so... well it's quite difficult to support these days.</p>

        <p>From what I can tell they had still never even attempted a form of RNA vaccine up into 2018 with the HPV gene therapy "vaccines" because there wasn't an adequate amount of safety data on how it effected humans.  People may have been theorizing on it for a long time but as of 2018 there was still no adequate testing and during the rollout of any RNA "vaccines" (that were already in mass production in February of 2020.)  They didn't even have animal testing when they started to administer them, which is required, so they did the animal testing at the exact same time that they did the human testing.  These people are so fucked in the head.</p>

        <p>I completely agree. However i don't wish to be part of the human trials. They need to be done and those participating in the experiments should be lauded. Human drug experimentation goes on all the time and there's nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>But I don't think I should have to choose between my body autonomy and my civil liberties.</p>
