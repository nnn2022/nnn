    <strong>The Media are Abysmal</strong>
    <p><p>The media in this country (United States) is absolutely abysmal. I have now talked to several friends, not one of who actually knows about the situation in the rest of the world. They all think that Europe and Asia got the virus under control months ago and are living life normally while the backward idiocracy of the United States is the only country on the planet with uncontrolled spread. They all basically shit their pants when I pull up a graph of any European country. The people that use the mainstream media as their only source have no idea about the second wave in Europe. They have no idea about the South American wave a few months ago. They have no idea that India has a similar number of cases to the US, but with 1/5th the testing. Yet, the whole narrative is if we all would have just locked down harder we could be open now. It wasn't until I started looking at skeptical subs that I realized that the same kinds of lockdowns and protests are happening across the whole world.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to insult the rest of the world, please don't take it that way. I'm just highlighting that uncontrolled spread is the norm across the globe, but those incontinent facts are scrubbed from our media.</p>
<p>Not to mention the mainstream media constantly parrot crazy 5% death rates. if someone they interview says COVID isn't dangerous for people under 50, they'll immediately underscore that young people still <em>can</em> get it -- we'll no shit, the guy never said they can't. I don't think the media once has actually used the CDC number that suggest the COVID survival rate is 99.96% for those under 40. It just pisses me off because the numbers are easily accessible. The numbers are right on the CDC website or on Worldometer or Johns Hopkins. Anyone can look at the data and figure this stuff for themselves, but people still listen to the warped version parroted by the MSM. It's like living in the Matrix listening to these people who are so disconnected from reality, like when they ripped the Trump official for focusing on mitigation rather than containment, calling it "surrendering to the virus." Well, what the hell else are you going to do when there are 100k new community infections a day? They actually have their viewers convinced that the virus can simply go away with enough contact tracing and testing. I just can't believe there are people out there who still listen to ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, NYT, WaPo and think that's the news and don't recognize them as just anti-American, circlejerking propagandists. Pravda would be proud.</p>

        <p>You aren't wrong. There was a time when journalists made their name exposing things, and today it's quite the opposite.  Ironically,  you'll be called a fascist for questioning authoritarianism and censorship.</p>

        <p>In UK they downgraded the virus since march and itâ€™s there on the government website to this day. Not a fucking word has been said about this anywhere. That tells you all you need to know.</p>
