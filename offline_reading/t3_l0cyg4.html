        <p>"here's why you should wear two masks" ..  because one mask doesn't fucking stop a virus from spreading..</p>
<p>If one mask doesn't stop a virus would 2 masks? 🤔</p>
<p>The answer no IT WON'T</p>

        <p>I can't tell if this is satire or not, but just in case:</p>
<p>Masks are literally just physical barriers with open holes on the sides. No one is claiming they completely stop the virus spreading. They just reduce the chances of the virus getting access to noses/mouths (and to slow their spread in the air once the particles leave the mouth/nose).</p>

        <p>You're not very clever are you? You've mistaken adequacy at school for a level of scientific insight that you do not possess but still feel compelled to inflict on other people.</p>
<p>This virus (as with all respiratory viruses) is airborne. That means it is aerosolized. Aerosols pass through your mask as though it was not there. </p>
<p>If you think that a mask works it is because you are an idiot of the highest order who has bought into the "droplets" bullshit which even a 3-year-old could see through if they spent any time thinking about it because a.) droplets fall under gravity - they're not going in people's eyes, nose or mouth unless they're right up next to you and b.) as strangers don't tend to cough or sneeze in your fucking face - it would be a disastrous transmission mechanism (the only time it would work is with very close family/friends) . </p>
<p>So, feel free to visit a sub where they celebrate the stupid "religion of pretend science" and spew this horseshit there but here? We're not falling for it.</p>

        <p>First, aerosols are still matter and still obey the laws of physics. If they run into fabric, they'll stop. If this wasn't the case, you wouldn't be safe on the other side of a brick wall.</p>
<p>A much larger concern for covid is droplets which any moron can understand are caught by masks at varying levels depending on the material and weave. </p>
<p>And while I don't doubt your life goals are no higher than being smarter than a three year old, any intelligent adult knows that air currents, temperature, pressure, and droplet size all play a role in their ability to travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/qzARpgx8cvE">Not to mention literally all speech generates droplets.</a> Not just coughing and sneezing.</p>

        <p>Also I'm not claiming to be clever. I don't have to be clever to talk about this stuff</p>
<p>Droplets fall under gravity. But they also dry out in the air. And some of the infectious matter will be separated from the droplets in the air. So if you catch the droplets in the mask, then you slow that process down.</p>
<p>Coughing and sneezing put droplets into the air. But not everyone is coughing and sneezing in shops. They are often speaking though, and speaking does put droplets into the air. A mask catches most of those droplets.</p>
<p>Masks aren't snorkels that suck all the infectious shit into space. No one is claiming that. Things can get through a mask. And eventually all the same air is going to be in the room whether the mask is on or not. And all that air is mixing together all the time. So how the hell do they help? By slowing down those processes. Putting barriers up to reduce amounts of material getting into the air freely. Keeping the material more localised to the face, rather than being shot out into the room.</p>
<p>It's not about stopping the infectious material completely. It's about slowing it down. Not eliminating all risk, but reducing it.</p>

        <p>Yeah sure, there's discussion to be had about aerosols (impaction, diffusion, etc). Let's not get into that though.</p>
<p>There's ZERO doubt to be had about the droplets produced by speaking/sneezing/coughing. They are indisputably hindered by the mask. Any idea that masks don't hinder droplets is utter willful ignorance.</p>
<p>Again, it doesn't stop everything but it stops some things.</p>

        <p>If companies and homeowners would invest in UVA light systems and positive pressure with adequate air movement this thing would've been gone a long time ago ..  but no .. no one listens to the fucking air filtration experts because the almighty mask cures all woes. But..  we've been wearing masks for a year and it's only getting worse I wonder? Oh that's right because one mask doesn't work let's force people to wear two. </p>

        <p>No but there is evidence that shows how seatbelts reduce risk of death/serious injury. Seatbelts don't eliminate risk, the reduce risk.</p>
<p>No one is claiming masks are going to stop a country from having 'problems'. Just that they reduce the rate of transmission.</p>
<p>Again, it's risk reduction. Not risk elimination.</p>

        <p>It's not risk reduction when people are told to continue about their normal lives as long as they wear a mask ..  the mask isn't enough it never was enough and telling people that masks help at all just gives people a false sense of security which leads them to go do things they wouldn't do without a mask ..  also all you guys say is no one is saying masks stop a virus .. which isn't true. The media may not be saying it outright but the normal people are saying it. Why else are millions of people wearing a mask in their car by themselves right now .. or wearing a mask while riding a bicycle outside in the fresh air.. or wearing a mask while not wearing gloves in public places .. it's all total bullshit dude</p>

        <p>Yes because we've all been getting sick for the last 10 millions years because we inhale large amounts of spit from other humans ..  when's the last time someone accidentally spit on you? ..  it doesn't happen. It's the shit you can't see floating around that's smaller than the mask filtration capabilities that get you sick. It's the shit you touch that someone else snotted on and the snots dried up and then you touch your face..  the mask does not help anyone whatsoever when dealing with a virus. It actually just makes it worse because people think they are safe and then put themselves in situations they normally wouldn't put themselves in.</p>

        <p>Its accepted understanding that covid transmission is primarily from "infected people through infected secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions or their respiratory droplets, which are expelled when an infected person <strong>coughs, sneezes, talks or sings</strong> (2-10)".

        <p>Masks are a way to reduce risk, not eliminate risk. The <a href="https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-020-00475-6">evidence</a> <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/01/08/2021.01.08.21249439.full.pdf">shows</a> they are effective.</p>
<p>Covid still being present in the US has no impact on the efficacy of the masks in impeding droplet transmission. A country without a mask mandate fairing well has no impact on the fact that masks reduce risk of transmission. Perhaps the latter means that a mask mandate is not necessary in every country (of course), but it doesn't mean that a mask mandate won't reduce transmission rates in the US. </p>
<p>There are so many compounding factors with how countries' have fared with covid. It's definitely complicated, and its why its the focus of a lot of research at the moment. The evidence is overwhelmingly supporting the premise that masks are effective tools for reducing droplet transmission.</p>

        <p>I'm repeating myself because its an indisputable, evidence supported fact that masks impede droplet transmission. In such a complex topic with a lot of mysteries, the efficacy of masks is not one of them. You make all of these different comments about it but none of them change the evidence.</p>
<p>\&rt;  masks don't work because the spread is forever getting worse</p>
<p>I'll repeat myself again. Masks are risk reduction. The spread getting worse while masks are being used does not mean that the masks are ineffective. Say a road gets all these potholes in it after a storm and death rates increase. That doesn't mean seat belts don't reduce risk of death in a crash. In the same way, the covid spread getting worse does not mean that masks don't reduce the risk of droplet transmission.</p>
<p>\&rt;  ok to drink poison because its watered down .. no STOP DRINKING POISON</p>
<p>Yes! Masks impede drinking the poison (infectious droplets).</p>
<p>The evidence is not showing that masks make it ok to drink the poision. Just that it makes it less likely for the posion to enter your mouth.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's a great visualization to show how the masks don't stop a virus nor slow it down in anyway shape or form .. notice all the shit flying up and around the mask into the air .. the moisture then evaporates leaving the virus particles and those particles are then spread around the entire area and then go straight through someone else's mask while they think they are safe .. a mask does not keep you or anyone else safe or safer from a virus I promise you. I've been dealing with air filtration and air movement for 20 years. You must stearalize a virus to keep it from reproducing inside your body.</p>

        <p>Funny thing about that, Scientology teaches that if you follow the 'tech' you gain superhuman abilities, including an immunity to all diseases. So why oh why would Tom Cruise be at all concerned to wear even one mask, let alone two?</p>

        <p>Yep. People who would do it of their own free will are crazy. This isn't even that bad and people are treating it like ebola or leprosy just because "it's out there." It's just plain paranoia. Being forced is even crazier but I don't understand how a person of sound mind could think that it's normal to wear one.</p>

        <p>There are legit professional respirator masks available now for less than $1 apiece. If you're worried about Rona, that's okay. But the smart move is to buy something that will actually work, not to double down on shit that won't. Every single cloth mask I've seen comes with an explicit warning saying that it will NOT stop viruses and bacteria. Would any of you buy a car battery if the box said "this battery will not do what you want it to do"? Would buying 2 of them fix the problem?</p>
