    <strong>PSA: We're not necessarily "conspiracy theorists"</strong>
    <p><p>Now, I'm sure some people here are conspiracy theorists, and if you are, I'm by no means putting you down. Believe in what you want.</p>
<p>But not all of us are conspiracy theorists. So many things have came true or have been proven true about Covid that were once deemed "conspiracy theories". It's not like Flat Earth or the moon landing being faked where they have never been proven to be true (I personally don't believe in either of those conspiracy theories, but let's not get too much into that). I don't blindly believe everything the media says, nor do I blindly believe everything they say is false. I look at the evidence presented and come to my own conclusions.</p>
<p>Vaccine passports/mandates, the vaccine not preventing infection or transmission, faulty PCR tests, the return of mask mandates have all been proven true, despite previously being considered conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>It's not about the vaccine giving us an "extra limb" or "5G radiation" like the doomers like to bring up, it's about it actually being dangerous, killing far more people than any other vaccine in history.</p></p>

        <p>Agree. My brother was ranting about so much of this stuff for months. I couldn't take it and thought he had lost his mind. Two weeks ago I had to call and tell him he was right about all of it. </p>

        <p>I have a screenshot of a text conversation with my husband on April 6th, 2020 when I told him that based on my research, there was no way the test could differentiate between the flu and covid, and my suspicion was backed up by literally hours of digging for statistics I did on the CDC site. I suspected flu cases were being relabeled as covid, and I was shocked. </p>
<p>He believed me. We lost friends over me sharing this info. We have family members who no longer speak to us because "we went off the deep end." Just some dumb brainwashed southern rednecks.</p>
<p>My husband was stuck overseas at the time for work, on a boat that basically became a floating quarantine vessel for 2 and a half months. I was scared to death initially, I was home alone running our property with our child and I had no idea when I was going to see my husband again.</p>
<p>I was SO FUCKING ANGRY when I realized things were  politically motivated and manipulated. That day alone will forever stand in my mind as the day I lost what little faith I had left in government or news. I spent days crying in the shower, trying to keep up a normal life facade to not scare my child, not knowing when she'd see her dad again, or if she would. Not knowing if he'd get stuck in a government quarantine tent if they let him back into the country. A government that made me fear for my family like that ignited a hatred in my soul and I knew I'd never blindly trust anything published by the media or the white house again.</p>
<p>We weren't wrong then, we have been on point since, and I really do hope I'm wrong about stuff going forward...but the last 19 months has proven that I'm better off trusting my research and my gut instead of the ever changing "science" and news. </p>
<p>People can say I'm a conspiracy theorist. I just say I'm an independent fact checker.</p>
