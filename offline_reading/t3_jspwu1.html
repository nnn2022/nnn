        <p>It didn't work at Starbucks, but I complained to corporate and they sent me a $10 gift card and said they'd be contacting the offending chain. So far I've only been asked if I needed a mask, to which I've either replied "no thank you" or flat out ignored.</p>

        <p>Im in the uk.</p>
<p>Ive been hoping to use it as a reason, so far no one has asked.</p>
<p>Yesterday i had to go to the post office, and then to the apple store. The first being a govt building, the second, well, the apple stores here are ott. Temp checks, masked up workers hanging out on front of the store. </p>
<p>I headed to the post office first. I considered, on the way, whether id just put on the mask if asked, or claim exemption. I really needed to send the package so i was worried. Got there, peeked through the doors to see everyone masked up. Thought to myself, fuck it. Ill go in no mask, see what happens. </p>
<p>Had a brief conversation with the guy that sold me the envelope, walked through the store to the table to write the address on said envelope. Waited in line to send envelope. Paid for and sent envelope. Not a word. Brilliant.</p>
<p>Apple store next. Now, the store itself isnt open, as we ARE in some sort of lockdown, but its open for pickups. I had ordered earlier in the day, so i was only going to pick up what id ordered. However, everyone outside the store, in the lines are ALWAYS masked up, so i anticipated a little pushback.</p>
<p>Walked up, gave them my info, got in line, got my stuff. No one said anything. I even watched as other people just put their masks on to get in line. People!! We are outside!!! Wtf.</p>
<p>Other than that, we go to the coffee shop and a couple grocery stores. They never ask. If they did, wed go somewhere else.</p>
<p>One day someone will ask. Aha</p>

        <p>Lol I don't wear one, mainly at work. I keep to myself and don't bother anyone but lately the health department here is talking about "surprise inspections" and fines for people not wearing a mask. So I may have to start wearing one.</p>

        <p>Since every little state, town, and county has their own implementation of mask rules, there is no universal answer even within a single country.</p>
<p>In the USA such laws (where they exist) have generally been written such that public mask wearing is mandatory but there is no defined penalty.  Again, there is in some places. Businesses and such are required to require masks and may suffer penalties if they don't.   Again the exemptions are in each specific area, but most give medical exemptions and do not require proof of the medical condition.</p>
<p>But in general, private businesses can pretty much refuse service for any reason at any time.   So if I'm a pub and can have my license pulled for a violation I'm going to enforce it enough to keep my license.  If you come in and claim you can't wear one because of PTSD or something I might take the safe course and ask you to leave even if the rule says you don't have to have documentation. </p>
