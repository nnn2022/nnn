        <p>How caring and compassionate of you. If you really want to bring Darwin and fitness into this, those dying from the virus are weak and we should take no particular precautions as a society to prevent that. However, I believe individuals and their families have the right to take whatever precautions they so choose whether or not it does any good. It just shouldn't be mandatory.</p>

        <p>This is a great move from Biden. He'll institute a mandate where he's legally allowed to (as it states in the article). Meanwhile, he'll provide some proper leadership and modeling on the use of masks, rather than the contradictions and misinformation we've received from the Trump administration. </p>
<p>It will be good to have the leadership vacuum filled, and to have reliable information be disseminated. I don't think they'll get everything right, or that everyone will adhere to the suggestions. However, it's the first step we need to take to prevent worsening damage from the pandemic.</p>

        <p>\&rt;  This article is filled with blatant distortions and gaps in logic. </p>
<p>Please do go on citing these blatant distortions and gaps in logic. It would be a fruitful discussion. I was responding to the notion that there is no evidence that masks work. In invite you to add your expert criticism to this so we can all learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of these arguments. Sources would be excellent, as well, and I would not recommend blogs. </p>
<p>\&rt; If masks work, we expect less cases over time--this is obviously not what we are observing. </p>
<p>You might expect fewer cases over time, yeah. If people were actually practicing the recommendations at the level they should, in addition to social distancing. </p>
<p>Moreover, this is not a real-world experiment. We have no control; we can only see what we see, and it's going to take a while to parse that out. Your statement can be broken down cleanly and simply with a question:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How many cases and deaths would there be with none of the substandard mitigation efforts we've put in place?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Furthermore, what would have been the impact if we had gotten leadership that encouraged mask wearing in people who could? Babies, people with asthma/PTSD (though I will be quick to submit that I have asthmatic family who have no problem wearing masks, as well, the only difference seeming to be they don't make it a political issue), and other people wouldn't have needed to. But if everyone had willingly adopted the recommendations against COVID, where would we be sitting now?</p>
<p>We might be sitting closer to infection and death rates of countries like New Zealand or Japan, the latter in particular already having an entrenched culture of mitigating risk against airborne pathogens and maintaining good hygiene in general. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In summary, no. We are not currently running the experiment. We cannot know what would happen if everyone wore masks. We know what we've seen with the half measures and the large bloc of Americans who have steadfastly refused to exercise caution, and it's not pretty in the slightest.</p>

        <p>| Compliance with masks has consistently gone up since Covid </p>
<p>In total, yeah. I read that something like 90% of people are adherent to masks at least "sometime" (as of October, according to the thing I read). Only 72% were adherent all the time, and this varied quite a bit depending on the demographics. Men and people identifying as Republicans were less likely to wear them at all, or to wear them less than "always" when they're unable to social distance.</p>
<p>What this kind of data says to me is that trying to assess this is complicated, and it's not as simple as "mask use has gone up." So has the general willingness of people to congregate. So has the the willingness of people to flout the recommendations altogether. Moreover, wearing a mask alone is good, but it has to be worn correctly, so simply having a mask on your face isn't sufficient to confer protection, necessarily.</p>
<p>| yet we are seeing a spike in cases. Why do you think that is? I’m guessing it’s mostly due to seasonal changes. </p>
<p>I'll preface by saying I'm not an infectious disease expert. But I think you're definitely touching on a big contributor. As with every airborne infection, the incidence increases as we're moved more indoors. There are probably others, but the mass demonstrations we've seen across the country, as well as people traveling en masse also don't help. I don't think a large swath of the country is taking COVID seriously.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a lot more we could discuss in this line. And I am deeply disappointed in the leadership of this country, from the top to the governors and mayors, in not providing good example (either downplaying the risk, or telling people to do something and then traveling off for a super-fun rich person getaway). Leadership, across the board, has failed to rise to the level that would have helped.</p>
<p>| What percentage of people have to wear masks for it to be effective in your opinion? </p>
<p>I don't have an earned opinion on that matter, so I wouldn't consider me a legitimate resource on it. However, I do feel it's unknowable what the optimal rate of compliance with mask wearing needs to be to have an impact. We don't have the alternate universe control where NO ONE wore a mask to test how much faster COVID would have spread. </p>
<p>We have inclinations that stricter measures and can help stem the tide, with key examples being Japan and New Zealand. China, if you believe their data. But then you have other countries that apparently took things seriously who have had issues all their own. </p>
<p>But to actually arrive at an answer to your question, undeniably the best would be for 100% of people to wear masks. And I would go so far as to say we should normalize wearing masks in public if you've recently been sick or in contact with a sick person. COVID is teaching us that risk mitigation may shorten the flu season (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01538-8">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01538-8</a>). This goes beyond masks, of course, but these are such simple steps that I'm a bit flabbergasted that there are many opponents to wearing them, even if we don't know the extent of their efficacy.</p>
<p>To some, it feels like you either have to have a 100% effective mitigatory strategy, or there's no point in bothering. </p>
<p>But we're not talking about providing prophylactic antivirals to everyone</p>
<p>We're not talking about mandating an invasive procedure to prevent COVID.</p>
<p>We're not talking about never leaving your home.</p>
<p>We're talking about putting a cover on your face when you aren't sure if the area you're going to is safe. It's astounding that there's such vocal opposition to this basic step. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>|If you say 100%, I hope you realize that’s never going to happen, even if the government mandates it. </p>
<p>Maybe not, especially as long as it's being politicized. But wearing a mask, for the vast majority of people, poses no issues whatsoever. If we were to evolve to think of wearing masks and maintaining 6 feet of separation (when possible) the way we think of washing our hands after using the bathroom, we'd likely make a big impact on various contagious diseases.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone washes their hands when they enter someone's home, or when they use the bathroom. But you're shamed if you don't take that extremely fast, extremely basic step to protect yourself and those around you. That won't ensure 100% adherence, but you're not exactly finding any hand-washing detractors here, even though that became the "new normal" at one point in time.</p>
