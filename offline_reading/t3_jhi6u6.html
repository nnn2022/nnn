        <p>&rt;that doesn't mean this whole problem isn't there.</p>
<p>No one's saying that the virus isn't there.</p>
<p>&rt;Don't take a side and stick with it no matter what!</p>
<p>Like the media and many (MANY) doomers do? This happens on both sides, it's human nature. People first believe in something, and if if they're presented with reasons why they should change sides, they often just refuse to. It's not exclusive to one side. In terms of how this effects people currently, we're learning more and more every day that this virus isn't actually cancer spreading through the air and won't kill you if you step outside. There are many, many more reasons to go back to normal now than there were, say, 6 months ago - we know much more about this virus than we did then.</p>
<p>&rt;You know damn well that looking like a lunatic won't increase your chances of being listened to</p>
<p>Pot, meet kettle.</p>
<p>&rt;Don't be stupid. Don't be extremely trustful.</p>
<p>&rt;if the fucking government tells you to wear a mask, you wear it until the restrictions are gone</p>

        <p>I know you tried to make me look like a hypocrite there but you know damn well what I meant. You, as a person, cannot counter restrictions. There is just no way around it. If something which such power tells you to do it, you have to, even if you know they are wrong. I have many beliefs in common with some people from this subreddit but we have to accept that individually, we cannot do anything.</p>

        <p>But how could you say that you should blindly follow the government's word and instructions to the tee, yet tell others to not be stupid and extremely trustful?</p>
<p>Of course I can't, I highly agree with you. That's a large reason why I don't give a shit about politics, because what I do likely won't change anything, and only hurts me in the end. That's why I never get upset about it. I only care if something directly effects me. I figure if it's important enough, I'll hear about it anyway.</p>
<p>I tried taking that approach with this virus. When the world first started losing their minds over this, I didn't take notice and brushed it off. But it was forced down my throat at every possible turn, and goverment insisted that it was going to impose it's will on everyone and their lives. That's when I got tired of it all. So while I certainly realize I can't counter restrictions, I can still do my part to follow what I believe in and spread the word to others in hopes that it maybe sorta-ish helps end the madness and paranoia, even just a day sooner.</p>
<p>&rt;If something which such power tells you to do it, you have to, even if you know they are wrong. </p>
<p>I think that's quite a dangerous mentality to have. Why I love America is the contrary to what you say. If I disagree with someone/an organization, I can freely protest and fight for what I believe in, without having an "accident". If they were handing out jail sentences for not wearing a mask and not locking yourself inside, then sure, it'd be stupid for me not to follow those regulations and I should find other means of protesting. But they aren't, so I'm not going to. I'm more than happy to risk all the social consequences that result from my personal decision to stand up for what I believe is right.</p>

<p>you see. that's where my problem comes in. I'm not from the US. I'm from Romania, where restrictions are put just as a way for the government to make money. they give fines all day and all night for bs reasons.</p>
<p>it is kind of a dangerous mentality, you're right, but is there a way to protest without being harmed? look what happened at the George Floyd protests. people got shot, killed, harmed, traumatized etc. the same will happen if mass protests happen with these covid restrictions. After all, I just want things to go back as they were.</p>

        <p>Aah, well Romania is much different. I have friends from there and plan to visit sooner rather than later, but I can't say I know much about it as far as protesting without being harmed. I have no idea what Romania's laws and regulations are like.</p>
<p>Regarding the Floyd protests, those weren't at all about lockdowns or masks, and was a completely different (and violent) group of people in the streets that were going out of their way to kill, harm, burn, loot, and riot.</p>

        <p>well, it's false until proven. <em>And</em> it's likely for you, human, to basically be paranoid because basically that's how you evolved. Usually you could hit a threat in the face but covid has no body, it's the air you breathe itself. So it's only natural for your anger to boil, because there's nothing it could be released against.</p>
