        <p>Nope. I do if it's rape, incest, or the mother/baby has a medical condition that won't let them live through it, or if it's a poorer household that can't keep a baby and can't find a suitable adoption center, but if someone just doesn't want a kid, no.</p>

        <p>Agreed!</p>
<p>The thing is, we wouldn't have that bad of a lockdown if people would do what they were told.</p>
<p>Japan's citizens do!</p>
<p>Their unemployment rate (3.0%) is less than half of America's (6.9%).</p>
<p>What's even more staggering is their death rate!</p>
<p>Japan has around 125.5 MILLION more citizens than America. Their death rate is (~)2,076 from covid. America's, on the other hand, has a death rate of (~)269 THOUSAND!</p>
<p>Now, their love for anime isn't saving them from the life threatening virus. The facts show that Japanese citizens are waaay more likely to wear their masks! Maybe because they're smarter, maybe because they don't think that it's an infringement on their rights, or, hell, maybe it is because of anime. All we know is that they wear their masks, and honestly, I'd rather live in Japan than a place where inconsiderate assholes cough on people in the subway.</p>

        <p>I told someone on reddit I don't wear a mask when I'm alone in my car, and he called me an "anti-masker". </p>
<p>That's your problem. Put everyone who doesn't 100% agree with everything you say into the same group, and you have a lot of enemies. Learn some nuance, however, and you'll realize an anti-lockdown person is different from an anti-masker, and both are different from someone who thinks the whole virus was made up. </p>
<p>But no, go ahead. Group them. </p>
<p>I can tell you haven't spent long on this sub because most of the people here are just afraid we'll be wearing masks forever, or that there will be some serious oversteps of governmental authority in the future because we did it this year. </p>
<p>Like maybe next time, there's a curfew, but not for COVID. Maybe the 2022 curfew will be about preventing unnecessary carbon emissions from people driving at night or something. That's what most of this is about. Preventing a new permanent normal... Hence the name of the sub.</p>

        <p>If you don't want to wear a mask when alone, you don't have to. Personally, I wear one in my car, (usually,) but it's mainly just to remind me to take it when I get out. I'm just sick of the people going to crowded places, their jobs or school, and not wearing one because it's infringing on their rights to strap something over their ears. I'm sick of the people who make up bullshit excuses to try and get out of a minor, minor inconvenience which can literally save lives.</p>

        <p>Oh, I agree. I just don't think that a tyrannical government would be giving it's citizens ways to survive during a global pandemic that could be stopped pretty easily.

        <p>Ironically Iâ€™m black. Plenty of whites people get shot by police too, that tends to happen when you are a criminal resisting arrest. The only way to end that kind of violence is to legalize all drugs, which I am all for. The reason most people become criminals is because prohibition causes their fix to become to expensive, so they turn to crime. Iâ€™m for getting rid of laws, not creating new ones, which is why Iâ€™m anti-new normal. While itâ€™s sad that a statistically insignificant amount of old people have died ( no one here thinks the virus is a hoax) itâ€™s not worth losing freedoms our country men have died for.</p>

        <p>I wonâ€™t speak for the dead, but perhaps if this was like the Black Plague or even the Spanish flu, I could probably understand basic precautions, but covid has a 99.8% survival rate, which proves to me that the response to it has been nothing but an obvious power grab by a corrupt government.

        <p>99.8% is a lie.
You're thinking of the survival rate of everyone. (The amount of people who have died compared to the amount who haven't contracted it/survived.)
The covid survival rate (the amount of people who have contracted it and survived) was lowest in early March of 2020. It had a 58% chance of killing the person it had infected. More than 70% (71.6%) in HDUs. How do people get the virus? From someone else. How do you protect your coworkers, family, friends, and strangers from it? You put a light inconvenience on your face. You'd get more of an inconvenience if you didn't wear it, because you wouldn't be allowed to enter most places.</p>

        <p>The reason so many people died at the beginning was because of the nursing home and ventilator fiascos. We arenâ€™t doing that anymore so survival rate is much higher. Youâ€™re right that it is an inconvenience to be harassed, which is why most people here wear one when required, doesnâ€™t mean we have to agree with it.</p>

        <p>Or not being able to breathe without a tube down your throat that you have to be knocked out in increments to stop the pain? How about pneumonia or not being able to get out of bed? Or being confined by law in a room so that you won't spread that 'fate worse than death' to anyone else? Or eating through a tube in your arm? Maybe a dry cough for hours a day?</p>
<p>Or would the worst part be knowing that it could've been stopped if some asshole had followed the law?</p>
<p>There is no reason that someone shouldn't be wearing a mask. Even if it doesn't work as well as the trained professionals say it does, you can still wear one. It's not going to do you any harm.</p>
