    <strong>PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU HATE ME</strong>
    <p><p>I only joined this sub to explain why I wear a mask (I know this isn't the entire purpose of this sub, but I know most on here dont like wearing masks, and/or think it's useless)</p>
<p>I've had several family members die because of this virus. I've seen so many people affected by it in a negative way, and it just sucks. Wearing a mask doesn't do much, but it prevents you from breathing, sneezing, or coughing on other people. It doesn't hurt anyone, and it's not that inconvenient (although I have a friend that has really bad claustrophobia, and can't wear a mask for very long without having a panic attack) If you can, wear a mask whenever you go out.. I know it doesn't do much, but it stops you from getting spit and other shit on people.</p>
<p>I know nobody cares about one 14 year old kid's opinion, and will probably think I'm being brainwashed into believing this, but please for the safety of others, wear a damn mask.</p></p>

        <p>Yes it has a high survival rate, but older people, and people with autoimmune diseases could get very sick or die. While there is a vaccine available, for the time being not everyone wants to get it.. My grandmother has to wait to get it because it could be fatal for her... have I made my point yet, or should I continue?</p>

        <p>I'm sure this is going to sound really mean and horrible but I'm just saying this from a logical perspective here so hear me out. Why is it a complete strangers responsibility to protect someone they don't know? In a perfect world that would be lovely. We don't live in a perfect world and we never will. There are risks that come with being human and living life. Many people have had their entire lives destroyed and lost everything over the past year. The very last thing on their mind is going to be someone else's Grandma who they've never met and might never bump into. If we all lived Our Lives under the premise that other people are going to do what we think they should and protect us and make sure we are safe and healthy it would be a complete disaster. We've never done it before now and most people are not going to do it at this point. It's been an entire year of this. People were more than willing to go along with this in the beginning for the first couple of months or so. But at this point in time we need to go back to normal life again. We can't live in a Perpetual state of fear and Terror and worrying about everyone else's Grandma's.</p>

        <p>This is fair, I'm just talking about wearing a mask to somewhere public with a lot of people. Believe me, I really want things to go back to normal and i completely understand your viewpoint. Just think about anybody you know that could be vulnerable, and how much grief it would cost you if you lost them (obviously if you dont have anyone like this just try to see my point)</p>

        <p>In my state, anyone over 16 can now get it. I'm sorry that your state sucks at logistics for vaccine distribution. If it's so fatal to your grandmother, isolate her until she can get it instead of using asks as a false notion of safety. Are you going to duck and cover if you see an atom bomb exploding?</p>

        <p>No you dont need to wear a mask during flu season because most people get the vaccine, and even if they don't it doesn't affect people like covid does. I've never had anyone die of the flu, but have had 4 family members die of covid. Also I'm sorry your kids have to see you wearing a mask, but honestly I dont see the big deal? It's rather harmless, and hardly affects your breathing..</p>

        <p>Ok... lots of people die of the flu lol. Just because your not personally effected by it? You realize the survival rate of covid is over 99% right? There's absolutely no justifying anything the government has done during this "pandemic" if you had no TV or internet you would have no idea we were in a "pandemic" people are not just dropping like flies. If we were in REAL pandemic with actual highly contagious, deadly virus would Costco still be packed every single day? Would restaurants be open? And busy every single night? Why would we have people preparing our food for us if its so deadly and contagious? Why has Dr Fauci (and our Dr.bonnie Henry as well) back tracked on their original statements of mask wearing? Why have they credited mask wearing and social distancing to a "non existent" flu season? It works for the flu that its eradicated but rona is still supposedly running rampant?</p>

        <p>I have never known anyone (personally at least) that has died of the flu, but have had at least 4 family members die of Corona. And yeah, the spread is slowing down, and there is a vaccine, but it's not going to magically disappear. I know it has a high survival rate, but people can still die from it. Same goes for the flu, but doctors have been treating that for forever pretty much, and almost everyone gets the vaccine, but people are skeptical about the covid vaccine and refuse to get it.</p>

        <p>No one I know ever gets the flu shot so I don't know why you think pretty much everyone gets it but that's a whole other subject. I am actually sick of people saying they have loved ones who are sick or died from rona like ok and? People literally die every single day of actual highly contagious diseases. People die of cancer every single day which hits way more families then rona ever will yet does the government do anything about things causing cancer? Remember when doctors and the government said smoking was good for you? Remember when the government promoted "low fat" foods as healthy like oreos? Knowing they're full of carbs and sugar? Don't get me started on the whole pain killers pandemic. Make anything I said in my comment before this make sense and maybe we can talk more. You are a child though so I can't hold any fault on you, you are a victim.</p>

        <p>I don't see any reason why people need to explain themselves. I see why you would wear one, I accept your reasons. It's OK. By the same token it's also OK not to wear one. This is where personal responsibility enters the chat. We can all only control our own behavior. What others do is their choice. If you are a person who feels at risk you cannot control an external environment. It will never be your ideal of what it should be. We all need to take that into account when making decisions.</p>

        <p>I hear you on this. I think the thing that's happening is a lot of people don't think covid is a hoax they think calling it a pandemic is a hoax. Meaning, we all know that this is an actual virus. It's a real thing. Most of us have known someone who had this or even lost someone who had it. But calling it a pandemic and closing the world down for an entire year and ruining people's lives that's what they're saying is a hoax. Not so much the virus. At least that's what I'm seeing. It's like people that don't want to take this vaccine being called anti-vaxxers. The way everything is now in absolutes is ridiculous. Either you do what you are told or you're an evil grandma killer that is selfish and horrible and you don't care about anyone. There's no room for disagreement now. I have taken so many vaccines in my life I can't even remember them all. I work in healthcare and I am older and I've had to take many in the past but this is one I won't be taking. Does that make me an anti vaxxer? Well by today's definition definition yes but I am not against vaccines at all. I just won't be taking this one. That decision has basically disqualify me from participating in life here in New York. We now have a vaccine passport, I can't attend any large events like concerts or sporting events without having that passport saying I'm vaccinated or I have to get a test. So basically I am now a second-class citizen. There is so much going on with this it's way more than a virus at this point. We started out with two weeks to flatten the curve, masks and hand washing, stay home to save lives. Now we have gotten to a point where if you don't download an app to scan your private health record you can't see the Yankees. It's ridiculous. People are done with this.</p>

        <p>I agree, it's getting ridiculous. It's your decision whether to get the vaccine or not, and even if I dont personally agree with your decision, it shouldn't exclude you from going to a Yankee's game if you arent showing any symptoms. I just hope that people are wearing a mask when they go out in public (again it's a personal choice) and staying safe! It's good to see someone who is civil's point of view, even if we dont agree. </p>

<p>Do you see the pattern. It starts small. As you say " it's not that inconvenient" 
Baby step slowly turn into great strides. </p>
<p>I respect yours and everyones right to mask up. Distance yourself. Quarantine and even take the vaccine if that's what you choose to do. However the path we are walking down is not as innocent as you may see it. I've said it before and I'll say it again do not be blindly obedient. Question everything! Do your own research and use a bit of critical thinking </p>
<p>Do not trade liberty for safety. Especially when safety is but an illusion </p>

        <p>I really only wear a mask when I'm out in public, and when I'm at school (I go to in-person learning) I take it off during class because we're around the same people every day. The whole "'take the vaccine if you want your freedoms back'" thing is bullshit though, people shouldn't be required to have the vaccine to go to the movies. 
But I respect everyone's opinion, and thank you for sharing yours :)</p>

        <p>Like I said you do what makes you comfortable. The whole point here is you have free will to do as you please and you don't have to answer to anyone as we are created equally. Same for people who don't want to wear masks it is their choice without having to explain themselves. </p>

        <p>Masks don't prevent anything in the case of disease spread.  Lord Fauci even said so back in the beginning.   I don't spit on people.  That's gross.</p>
<p>Masks do hurt people.   You even mention your friend who can't wear one for long.  Is so hard to  imagine there are thousands of others like your friend?  Or thousands more with other problems?</p>
<p>I don't think you're 'brainwashed', just misinformed.   And you've been overly frightened by a flu virus due to a constant drumbeat of information from all manner of media sources.   Sources who never gave a damn about your health before.</p>
<p>What you should consider is the kind of world you're going to have to live in for decades.   Do you really want to live in a world full of hyponchondriacs who are terrified of people breathing?</p>

        <p>I know there are a lot of people like my friend who can't wear one for long, so I dont just jump to conclusions when I see someone without a mask. I'm talking about people who can wear a mask should. Also the whole spitting on people thing, have you ever been talking and accidentally spit on the person you were talking to? I'm not terrified because I know if I get it I'll be fine, I just want to not accidentally spread it to people by talking to them.</p>

        <p>Yes, I have accidentally done that.  And it doesn't get anywhere near their mouth.  Even if I'm a foot away.  </p>
<p>Even with a mask you can spread it.   They are not magical.</p>
<p>We've been under a mask mandate for over 9 months.   I'd say compliance has been well over 95% for at least the past 6 months.   The rate of spread was no different than places with no mask mandates.</p>

        <p>In 2018 in the uk 25000 people died of the flu but governments didn’t lockdown then so why should they lockdown and bankrupt the entire population to fail at an attempt to save the elderly and weak who are killing themselves on mass because of the lockdown?</p>

        <p>You can read about how masks are already used for psychological purposes in the medical profession, it is to give the illusion of some things and to keep ypur mind focused on certain things, not necessarily some overt mind control scenerio. That information was widely available as well as the psychology of why masks might be used in epidemics. </p>
<p>Masks dont work; that is reason enough. They are symbols, and you are upset that people arent following the fad</p>

        <p>No, it prevents you from getting your spit on people, (that's how covid is spread btw) can I get one credible source on why masks dont work? Because I kind of want to know where you got this information.</p>

        <p>Yes people do spit, but thats not the primary way people get sick from Covid or other common respiratory disease. You probably have heard the term 'droplet' and are getting confused. Spit is a droplet, but droplets can be as small as 5 μm, and we also have to worry about aerosols and also fomites.</p>
<p>The source of information is all of the papers that have been written about respiratory disease and masks, of which there are literally thousands. I hate when people have told me this over various things, but you have to look it up and do some research because there is plenty info out there. I do not rely on 1 magical source.</p>
