    <strong>Trusting the experts with Vaccines and the Korean War</strong>
    <p><p>There's a well known public feud in 1950-51 between two influential people. General MacArthur, former Supreme Commander of Allied Operations in the Phillipines in WWII, made many statements criticizing then President Harry S. Truman's policies during the Korean War. MacArthur was commanding the USA/UN forces in South Korea at the time. Famously, Truman ended up firing MacArthur. </p>
<p>MacArthur was undisputedly a credentialed and talented military leader. He faced down the Imperial Japanese empire, and had some major accomplishments against the North Korean army after they invaded and nearly toom over South Korea. The North Korean line was then pushed to the extreme north, at which point China intervened, pushing the line back down to where it is today, ending effectively in a stalemate.</p>
<p>In a later interview, MacArthur lamented that the Korean conflict could have resulted in a total US victory if only the president hadn't ignored his advice. This is perfectly understandable! MacArthur was THE military expert, and Truman was a fresh faced politician who wasnt even physically able to fight. It made no sense to MacArthur that his expert advice was ignored. </p>
<p>He had identified between 30-50 millitary and logistical targets that were ideal candidates for the newly invented atomic bomb. By turning the northern border of Korea into a radioactive wasteland, there would be no chance of an army resupply. They could basically starve out the North Korean army and win, saving many thousands of lives, and prevent the spread of communism in the meanwhile. </p>
<p>Truman, of course, realized that this was fucking insane and sacked MacArthur. </p>
<p>Heres the main point:</p>
<p>MacArthur WAS NOT stupid. He was an expert. Not a degree collecting, ivory tower skulking expert, but a no-shit, literally tested in the battlefield expert. His career is stacked full of victories, which is the hallmark of a very good expert. MacArthur saw himself as a good General if he achieved victory, and as a failure if he didn't. </p>
<p>But Truman was still right, because again, the plan was fucking crazy. Even total  victory isn't as important as whatever Apocalyptic perpetual-acid-trip world that would have resulted from setting off 40 nukes on the same planet you happen to live on.</p>
<p>You can see where I'm going with this. I dont doubt that the CDC is stacked with experts, or that Dr. Faucci knows infectious diseases, or that pharmaceutical companies dont know how to make an effective vaccine. So yeah I technically  "trust the experts." But it's the same logic. Sure, coating the world in sanitizer, wearing 6 masks, getting an mRNA rewrite, etc. might very well 'stop the spread.' And if you're Faucci, and you're the expert,  and you succeed or fail on the single metric of body count with "COVID" stamped on them, then of course that's what you're going to believe.  Trust the vaccine and the science and the experts, we'll defeat the virus. Just like nuking the Korean peninsula to hell will end the war. No doubt.</p>
<p>This is sort of how I'm thinking about all this. I dont want to live in a communist country, I dont want to get sick,  I'd be much happier with health and freedom for everyone! But our solutions to these problems have to respect whatever harmony that currently exists. I dont see conspiracy or greed as the problem here (those always exist in every field at some level but those aren't going away), but the relying on single-mindedness that comes from expertise. </p>
<p>This isn't an anti science or anti expert position, it's just common sense and a healthy distrust of 'total' solutions </p>
<p>TL;DR Dr faucci recommends we nuke our immune system into submission just like Gen MacArthur wanted to nuke communism away. Bad idea.</p></p>

        <p>This is an agenda. These "experts" are paid shills and actor. There is no real science or concern going on here. There is no reason to trust any of them.</p>

        <p>“What ABC needs to do,” says Mullis, “is talk to Fauci and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html">Gallo</a> and <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">show that they’re assholes, which I could do in ten minutes.”</a></p>
<p><strong>“Guys like Fauci get up there and start talking, and he doesn’t know anything really about anything, and I’d say that to his face. Nothing.</strong></p>
<p>The man thinks you can take a blood sample and stick it in an electron microscope and if it’s got a virus in there, you will know it. <strong>He doesn’t understand electron microscopy and he doesn’t understand medicine.</strong> He should not be in a position like he’s in.”</p>
<p>“They’ve got a personal kind of agenda. They <strong>make up their own rules as they go.</strong> They change them when they want to, and smugly... like <strong>Tony Fauci does not mind going on television, in front of the people that pay his salary, and lie directly into the camera.”</strong></p>

        <p>Exactly.  Journalist and gay rights advocate, Terry Michael, was also longtime Fauci critic.</p>
