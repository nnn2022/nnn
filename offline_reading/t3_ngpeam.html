    <strong>Things are looking up, but I'm still incredibly depressed because I'm stuck wearing a mask at work</strong>
    <p><p>I work for a major grocery chain located in Texas (if you're from here, yall know the one) who still requires employees to wear masks. Customers are supposed to as well, but nobody enforces it, least of all me. I work there doing a very physically active job, 40 hours a week. I pull my mask down almost constantly when I can get away with it, but I have been harassed whenever caught--never by a customer, mind you, ALWAYS by other employees. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot believe the people who work around me are so completely cucked. There's no other word for it. Not only do they happily participate in these asinine and restrictive policies that follow no logical basis and protect nobody, they actively enjoy bullying others who push against it in even the most minor ways. I do not understand the mentality of people who get their rocks off by being unable to mind their own fucking business about something that doesn't affect them whatsoever. It's these idiots I work with who are to blame for this situation because they all rallied to make masks mandatory. I am so angry knowing that the customers around me get to have the freedom to be in my workplace unmasked and I don't. I am happy for them obviously, but I deserve the same rights they have. My employer is entitled to my labor and the high job performance I give them, and I am entitled to their money. They are not entitled to my rights. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This store has been shilling the vaccine nonstop. They send us emails and app notifications trying to get us to go out and get it practically every week. Now that a lot of us are vaccinated I was hoping the mask policy would get the boot, but it hasn't. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the worst part is, I'm sure that when it does finally get relaxed for employees, it will only be for people who can prove they're vaccinated. I don't know how that can possibly be legal, but I know other grocery chains are doing it already. I'm not vaccinated and I'd rather wear a mask at work every day for the rest of my time here than get it--but it makes my blood absolutely boil knowing that idiots who injected themselves with an experimental drug will get to smile and breathe and look fucking human and normal, and I will be forced to walk around with this cloth gold star on my face for everyone to see. I don't know what proof they'd want from us. If I can get away with lying, I obviously will. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get some hope talking to a few people there I trust who feel the same as me, but we are all in the same boat. I just fucking wish they'd let employees make the same decisions and have the same rights as customers. This is why businesses are equally to blame, as are governments, for the loss of bodily autonomy and the social brainwashing we are experiencing. Without them playing COVID police by blackmailing people into compliance with threatening to terminate their employment, we wouldn't have ever had masks in businesses. I can't afford to freak out about this because I'd be fired and I need this job. They know that and that's why nothing will change. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the people simping for business are fucking overdosing on cope, because they are also the enemy. If Abbott would fine businesses who force employees to do this, we wouldn't be here. No one is thinking about us.They are both fucking us over as employees. I feel like even though the rest of you in Texas might be free of masks, I never will be. If this job didn't pay my bills I would tell them to get fucked hard and raw and quit.</p></p>
