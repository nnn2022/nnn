    <strong>Suddenly when people are Dropping dead from the vaccine there is a "heat wave"</strong>
    <p><p>I just found this very odd. I have noticed with the MSM how everything just is so perfect. Then you have all the little clowns marching right after what the talking heads say to think. They will claim that morgues are filled up so no autopsies and these deaths will be very hush hush. You can almost just think whats going to happen next. Like with the blm riots. They have been rioting since 2015. They still never report on it. Its the same cycle.</p></p>

        <p>Yes and lockdowns will resume until next flu season, where restriction will be lifted in time for a seasonal flu... and then it'll be declared a new variant rather than flu... just like last year. <strong>This is literally the largest social experiment of all time.</strong></p>

        <p>Potentially <em>and probably...</em> but we can even take a more optimistic look and it could still turn nefarious.</p>
<p>Consider the groups working on these experiments had the most wholesome intentions. What stops less moral characters having access to the information and royal family money to implement policy to take advantage of human nature?</p>
<p>It isn't that <em>less-than moral</em> characters haven't always existed, it just turns out that now people are more exposed to information... <em>whether that is propoganda or not</em> which, sadly, has become a "choice" rather than a "check" to keep media honest.</p>
<p>Laws exist that allow the media to lie, censorship promotes the lie, wikipedia and other news agencies will cite a story and leave the cite even after the OG story is redacted. So it's an endless barrage of bullsht...  <em>I'd just truly like to know the root of why some people see this and some people don't when presented with the exact same information. As we move further into echochambers, this will only be further polarizing.</em></p>

        <p>Honestly, I feel like 3/4 of society is being mind controlled right now. Like too afraid to see through, so they don‚Äôt even try to. That‚Äôs cult mentality right there. </p>
<p>I've been in a cult before so I've seen how it affects the sheep. They were told the internet was bad except their website. I‚Äôd say 90% of people there never looked on YouTube because they were told it had "false information" about the cult. They were told if they left, their lives would be miserable (I‚Äôm perfectly fine btw) and Satan would be after them. All the fear that goes into controlling their mind was crazy. I‚Äôm glad I saw through it all. </p>
<p>Most of the sheep were well intentioned too. Genuinely nice people who thought they were doing good by spreading the cult magazines. But they were being misled. They don‚Äôt know, they probably never will. Because they‚Äôre told not to know.</p>

        <p>Yes! They‚Äôre kept in the dark, yet just light enough not to question their reality! </p>
<p>I got out because they preached "unconditional love" but hated unbelievers, women, gay people, the native people (because they‚Äôre very hard to convert and don‚Äôt buy into their cult bs at all). When I heard how they spoke of people I was like "if they speak that way about them, and claim to love everyone the same, I wonder what else they lie about..." </p>
<p>And then I saw the subliminal imagery in their magazines, regularly dumped door to door. I was going crazy over finding all the creepy weird images in their pictures for a while and then I went "okay, let's burn it now lol"...</p>

        <p>I'm not dismissing what you're saying, but why only in the PNW? Vermont has a really high vaccination rate, yet there's no heatwave killing people there. Honestly nothing surprises me anymore and it certainly wouldn't surprise me if they use natural disasters to cover vaccine deaths, but this heatwave is pretty concentrated to one area. Unless I'm missing something, which is entirely possible. I don't spend much time reading/watching current events because it's just so damn depressing anymore. :/</p>

        <p>I'm in Oregon, there definitely WAS a heat wave!!!!!!! Although I'm pretty sure any &amp; all dead because of all the places people go to cool off were closed 'cause Covid' (Yet oddly opened 2 days AFTER because of the arbitrary date set by our Dictator.) will be counted as "Covid".</p>
