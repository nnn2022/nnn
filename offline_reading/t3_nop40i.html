    <strong>Death Increase After Covid Vaccine Drugs</strong>
    <p><p>Here’s a very interesting article from a French physician showing an increase of deaths around the world from the covid vaccine drugs. </p>
<p>https://vaccineimpact.com/2021/french-medical-doctor-covid-19-injections-increasing-deaths-and-new-infections-the-evidence-is-overwhelming/</p>
<p>He also talks about one of several reasons short-term adverse reactions such as deaths can go down. If you’re testing a dangerous product, you will lose the people more vulnerable to short-term effects first — either they will drop out of the experiment or die. Either way, your test population then is made up of a population less vulnerable to short-term effects (but not less vulnerable to long-ter effects).</p></p>

        <p>This first wave of shots is to cull out the "low hanging fruit" for sure. And, undoubtedly, there will be many, many with long term effects that will eventually die as well.</p>
<p>But I think the real agenda is sterilization. The recent John Kuzak series (I think) he was in is chilling. I didn't watch even one episode but I watched a clip of his "Mad Man" diatribe from the show and I think he is telling us very clearly what's going on.</p>
<p>And it's no work of fiction.</p>
