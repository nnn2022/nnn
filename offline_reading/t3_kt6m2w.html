        <p>This is what people don’t understand. They assume anyone against lockdowns and restrictions are just a knuckle-dragging anti scientist.  </p>
<p>One can “Believe the science” (Garbage term but that’s what they use) and also believe wrecking the lives and livelihoods of the entire nation might not be the appropriate response. </p>
<p>You can give these people thousands of examples of how the response to this has harmed/killed people unnecessarily, and as far as they are concerned those are acceptable losses so long as the holy scientific scriptures are followed. It’s a kind of religious zealotry, but worse because they believe they have the actual truth in their pocket even more than religious extremists.</p>

        <p>That's terrifying! But also, how does it explain all the people who converted to our side more recently? There was constant fearmongering since about February last year, yet large numbers of people were converted into skeptics by the BLM rally hypocrisy in July for example. Did the brainwashing not fully stick for those folks?</p>

        <p>This is what happens when you deify science (or anything). It can't be looked at objectively anymore-- it starts to embody subjective <em>feeling</em>. This thing that <em>you are so sure is true</em> needs to be imposed on other people because you would bet your life on it, so why wouldn't they? </p>
<p>But this goes further and is even cult-like in that whereas a religious zealot might stop trying to change your mind after realizing you don't care about "saving your soul", these people go past perceiving it as passive disregard for the self to the <em>active harm of others</em>. That's why they engage with us as though we are school shooters or something</p>

        <p>No they do understand. Any idiot can see how lockdowns are damaging and no one wants them. They are probablly a last resort. They come at a cost. Npr did a segement last summer. Key words here are mitigation and time. There hasnt been enough of either. The problem is, when i say yes they are costly, then it transforms into something close to "i dont want to be property to the state". So which is it?  See how this can be confusing.</p>

        <p>I dunno about that, I’m friends with a lot of people who aren’t complete idiots and absolutely support lockdowns/restrictions and think people who think otherwise are idiots at best and quasi-killers at worst. </p>
<p>It’s usually people who were already on unemployment/ retired with a pension. People who already worked from home or easily transitioned to it without loss of income or inconvenience. Some people just aren’t good at imagining what it’s like to do otherwise/aren’t very empathetic. For them, this is a best case scenario where they keep taking in money and have no chance at becoming sick, but also get to feel like a hero with no effort. </p>
<p>They just fail to see how many people exist where that’s not a possibility, and that many of those have suffered immensely. As far as they are concerned, all that’s happened is they got to skip a commute to the office and back plus watch Netflix more.</p>

        <p>&rt; You can give these people thousands of examples of how the response to this has harmed/killed people unnecessarily, and as far as they are concerned those are acceptable losses so long as the holy scientific scriptures are followed. It’s a kind of religious zealotry, but worse because they believe they have the actual truth in their pocket even more than religious extremists.</p>
<p>My parents are exactly like this, and it is super frustrating.</p>
<p>We were talking about the new lockdown in Brisbane last night because we are under it this weekend, and no matter how much I tried to explain the unintended consequences that will come from lockdowns, all they could argue was that it would save lives.</p>
<p>Yes, but at the cost of even more lives! They don't care, they don't stop and think about it. They were telling me that if all the governments were doing it, it must be right. It's nothing but an appeal to popularity.</p>

        <p>Incredibly annoying. Of course, they mean well, but they give you that look like you're immoral when you suggest COVID isn't worth destroying the world over and it's hard to bear. I've had to question my sanity a handful of times this year. Every time the conversation comes now I just try to leave the room and avoid it.</p>

        <p>Please stop spreading this because it's wrong. The point of all the precautions is to "flatten the curve". That means more cases over a longer period of time, not stopping the virus as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>That's the thing though. The "experts" who called for lockdowns fucked up. They did not account for human behavior or resistance, and as a result their efforts were wasted. Now people like you seem to want to continue the lockdowns as a form of punishment, even though we know they are clearly hopeless and causing more suffering than they prevent.</p>

        <p>That's from one hospital with a sample size of... 10. 10 cases, in a country with a population of 66.65 million people. That's hardly enough to generalize so far as "UK child abuse up 1483%"</p>
