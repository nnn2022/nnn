    <strong>Thank you government and media, for tearing down families and dividing us even more as a society.</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday, my parents have been fighting over COVID-19 restrictions. I brought the subject on the table, so it's kinda my fault, but I didn't expect it to be that bad. I know that when someone brings the subject of Donald Trump or COVID, it would turn apeshit, but it would last for a short time and it was done. But this time, they've been fighting for a good 10-15 minutes, but it felt like 2 hours of intense arguing. My dad was telling my mom what it would be if this continues going on, and my mom refuted by repeating the same template NPC talking points. It made me sad, because they've been in a stable relationship for 25 years and friends for 27+ years and it was the first time in my 16 years of life I witnessed them fighting that bad.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I felt like shit. I almost cried from seeing that. It's crazy how the media has turned us against each other, promoting extremist behavior to normal people, and fearmongering us about COVID. When, I saw that, I didn't want to do anything, I wanted to chug the rest of my glass of beer, get drunk (the worst is that I'm not an alcoholic and I drink rarely, usually every few months) and feel nothing and escape from reality.</p>
<p>I feel like my family is more divided than before. The worst thing about it is that I am aware that there are worse cases than my family (I have always had a good family during my life) and I don't know how people live like that. So the media and governments have been causing division and destroying families for what? To save 95-year old granny who shits in a diaper, weighs 300 pounds, has liver failure and diabetes at the same time and lives a life not worth living? For a virus that has a 99% survival rate for people aged &lt; 65? I don't want to sacrifice my livelihood for that! I want me and people of my age to have a happy and successful life. I'm tired of this bullshit and I want it to end now!</p>
<p>Rant over!</p></p>

        <p>I know! I still don't understand how my mom still trusts them. These people have been lying to the people for a year now and our populace still listens to them. I know Quebec has always been very statist, but now it went to a new level.</p>

        <p>And we need to stand against that, but I'm sure that if only a minority of people are disobeying to the rules, they will tighten them as a justification to implement more of their dictatorship. If a majority of people disobey the rules, the we can turn the tables. Quebec's prime minister, François Legault, mandated masks outside during the "third wave", for a few days and it has been withdrawn afterwards because no one followed the rules because pro-maskers and pro-choice people thought it was exaggerated.</p>
<p>Crazy how non-compliance works!</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry about what happened. I know how you feel. Lately it’s been very hard &amp; depressing on me too. Sometimes when I sleep I sort of wish never to wake up, like, permanently if you catch my drift. I’ve fucking had it with this demonic run world. It seems civility &amp; common sense has been thrown out the window. I can’t take much more of this.</p>

        <p>Dang, in these cases, I just get angry I want to punch something so bad or forget about this world completely. I wish I could be in a dream world, in Sonic's world and be some fucking Sonic character that I invented during my pastime when I was young and naive. I wish I could be a bloomer instead of a doomer (not the COVID type). We've all become insane, I think on both sides of the COVID argument and I think the elite just wanted that. Divide and conquer! It's just sad to live a life about control and treating people like shit because you have a power trip. I don't know how these people can handle being so evil and corrupté</p>

        <p>It's not all bad. My wife and I have been married 28 years. We already had a great marriage but Covid has galvanized us into one unit, for sure. We know we are going to die together. That's where this ends for those of us who love freedom. We will not bow. We will never stop resisting. We were both made for this moment. The crucible purifies. There's glory in the revelation of character.</p>
<p>As for what you saw, I wouldn't make much of it going forward. If they have the relationship you've described, they will be fine. They are being purified. Their character will see them through eventually.</p>
<p>NEVER. GIVE. UP.</p>

        <p>I'm happy that your family stands for freedom! In my case, it just has been divided from my mom's family, who "listens to the experts", support the government's efforts to keep us at home, watch the news fearmongering on COVID-19 and on my dad's side, which tends to be more of personal responsibility and risk assessment. We still see my dad's parents, but they are in the risk group because they're old, so they took their precautions. They took the vaccine, I think they have the right of taking the vaccine, that's their personal choice and I'm happy for them for taking the vaccine. My dad and I won't take it, because my dad wants to wait for it, because it is experimental and in my case, I won't take it because I am in good shape and I have a good immune system and it doesn't change very much anything for people of my age.</p>
<p>Also thank you for telling me that it's gonna be fine cause I wasn't reassured in the moment. I don't really know a lot about relationship behavior because I never had a girlfriend myself (I know, that's sad but I don't mind for the moment).</p>
<p>I also wish to be part of an anti-lockdown protest, but I never had the occasion because we always were busy during that time.</p>

        <p>Fuck, I'm sorry to hear that, OP.</p>
<p>I'm also sorry to say it, but since your mom is a card-carrying Branch Covidian, your mom and dad putting some distance between each other could very well save you and your dad's lives if/when she starts pushing you to get the experimental mRNA gene therapy.</p>
<p>Then again, you mentioned being from Quebec, so I don't know what the laws as far as your mom forcing you to get the vax are concerned.</p>

        <p>The vax is not mandatory right now, but our government talked about vaccine passports so that people who don't get vaccinated can't participate in certain events or go get their groceries, etc. An article about that is linked in this post : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lvm4p7/who_knew_this_would_happen/">Vaccine passports for Quebecers</a> . I mean, my mom can't force us to do anything, she is not the government. She wants us to get vaccinated, you know why, "to save lives", and she got pissed off when we talked about it, but she can't do anything about it. We can visit our grandparents, despite the government prohibiting it. My mom doesn't agree with it, but she can't prevent us to visit them.</p>

        <p>That’s funny, my situation is the exact opposite. My parents have never really liked each other for as long as I can remember, they used to have such bad fights when I was little that my mom would take me and my sister to a hotel for the night. They stayed together for us, for which I’m grateful, but finally, and thankfully, got divorced about 15 years ago when we were both out of the house. When I talk to them on the phone now, they have the exact same opinion about the whole “pandemic”. Same talking points, some of the same references. Neither of them buy into any of it, and are totally against the vaccines. It’s so weird to me, they’re so alike in their political beliefs, but were never happy together. Go figure!</p>

        <p>It's only legal at 18 in Quebec and in Canada in general, but I still drink for special occasions every once in a while, when my parents allow me to and it's not a lot to make become drunkard.</p>

        <p>I feel you. My dad and I have definitely had the most contentious relationship lately. Which wasn't the norm... Prior to COVID we always got along and had a very goofy and fun relationship... But as COVID has gone on and i've seen him decay mentally, and he assumed the typical doomer stance from watching nothing but the news and I assumed a more anti-lockdown stance, we've had a few arguments and they're awful. He's horribly immature during arguments and resorts to name calling and trying to label me things to try and dismiss me rather than arguing the actual talking points.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's really caused me to lose a lot of respect for him as a person. Which I would have never thought would ever happen since I always thought the world of my dad. It's another sad casualty to this pandemic unfortunately.</p>

        <p>How is he destroying the family? He brought real arguments and my mom just denies what he says by whining and behaving irrationally. The irony is that she's a psychological nurse and deals with crazy people every day and she tells us that we think like some of her patients. I'm sorry, but I've seen more substantiated and convicing arguments from my dad than my mom.</p>
<p>I think I have more in common with my mom than my dad, so I guess I also am destroying the family, right?</p>

        <p>T'es-tu sérieux? Câlisse, tu pousses la même bullshit que tous les crackheads de cette secte de malades mentaux dans le fauchisme? Jamais je n'ai mentionné que mon père déniait la COVID-19 ou qu'il poussait des théories du complot sur le vaccin de la maladie chinoise. Mon père pense tout le contraire de ça. On a connu des personnes qui y sont tombées malades, mais ils n'étaient pas dans une situation sérieuse, mon père s'est même fait tester une fois, alors qu'il a eu contact avec une travailleuse malade, mais les risques de l'avoir étaient faibles dans ses circonstances selon la santé publiquee et comme de fait, il est revenu négatif. Le vaccin, on a évalué nos risques on ne le considère pas nécéssaire pour nous, sutout si les autres personnes à risque l'ont déjà été. Coudonc, il te manque-tu des cellules dans ton cerveau, parce que tu n'es pas capable de distinguer les nuances dans les arguments des autres, ou tu fais juste exprès? C'est fou à quel point vous voulez mettre des étiquettes sur les gens qui ne pensent pas comme vous, vous êtes vraiment dans une secte.  'Garde, je n'ai même plus envie de te parler, parce que tes commentaires précédents m'ont démontré le niveau d'argumentation et l'intelligence que tu avais. J'ai le feeling que je suis en train de débattre avec un enfant de 10 ans et moins!</p>
