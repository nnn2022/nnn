        <p>Yeah I completely stay away from conspiracy outside of subs of the conspiracy nature since it’s just disrespectful to have political discussion 24/7. I guess this doesn’t even matter as anyone who touches conspiracy is now seen as an asshole who can’t keep political discussion and theories in their appropriate forum.(I swear this resurgence of conspiracy theorists is a terrible thing and only serves to hurt the ideas and progress we had made in the past)</p>
<p>I earnestly wanted to help these two people as I was in a similar boat for nearly 2 years, but me damn social credit is too low to interact with people on these subs lol. Sorry for insinuating that SVT and POTS aren’t causes, they’re symptoms, it’s almost like my team of 5 doctors didn’t all agree on this and say that most of those abbreviated initial “illnesses” are more like symptoms as they don’t have established treatment protocols and things like lyme, tumors, adrenal issues, nervous issues, and Epstein Barr do have established effective ways of treating the symptoms at the very least, if not curing you of your “POTS/SVT” as well.</p>

        <p>That’s untrue, conspiracy theorists are either painted as bad because they intrude on others spaces and try to wake people up everywhere, or they’re left alone because they leave others alone. The new conspiracy theorists have a large pension for going into other subs and trolling or trying to wake people up and it gets us more negative attention than it could possibly ever help up. Fuck people being woken up the majority of people aren’t capable of thinking at the level it requires to critically think and criticize others ideas and thus can never be “awoken”. </p>
<p>The best way to resist the “new normal” is to simply shut up and not comply, point out outrageous examples to likeminded individuals(IN OUR SPACES NOT THEIRS), and be happy knowing your life is in your control. There is no SS going around checking that you’re vaccinated, there is no gestapo burning down your home and smashing your windows if you don’t comply with masks. </p>
<p>All I’m saying is you might be too new to this shit to remember a time when conspiracy theorists weren’t regarded as the devil, just a little paranoid, and not even an unhealthy amount of paranoia. There is a possibility that there might not be a narrative being a spun about us and that’s the most realistic best case scenario, and the way to get to that point is to live our own lives, and let those who like compliance comply.</p>

        <p>There is no perfect way to help. Many of us feel like it helps to reach out. Sadly this site isn’t for logic and reasoning. Only places like this subreddit and that’s when we feel like putting effort in. Sometimes we just come here to find something that resembles sanity in an insane world. We vote with our lifestyle but what happens when not everyone that knows what’s going on can vote with their lifestyle... Well I think that we need to reach out to get others on board. It’s like standing up for others. It’s almost always planting seeds of awareness. Some people aren’t ready and that’s okay. I haven’t gotten over the fact that we can’t wake up others. I know we can give others a push...</p>

        <p>Maybe you can’t wake up others because they don’t want to wake up? Maybe they’re simply being ignorant on purpose as ignorance is bliss? You can’t help someone who doesn’t want help, and sadly this is how most people are thinking. </p>
<p>Most would rather comply because it’s easy than look 10 years into the future and think about what else might just be easy to comply with. Many delude themselves into thinking that “when the government goes tyrannical I’ll help stop it” not realizing that by not waking up sooner, they’re normalizing compliance to governments and are not going to be able to muster enough people to stop a tyrannical government.</p>
<p>Yes this sucks, but it’s like trying to have a 6th intervention for an alcoholic, it’s not gonna work unless they want it to. I truly feel as if the best way to get our message out is to not campaign and try to convince people, but to let them eventually come around to our ideas by making our ideas logically sound and not dependent upon conspiracy buzz words like “covidians, double speak, and sheep”.</p>
<p>Sympathize with those not “awake” and make a point to not exclude them from our groups despite them doing the same to us, make it a goal to not be disrespectful to them when they decide to come to our subs, and if they’re impossible to reason with, don’t respond and move on! This is how I’ve been dealing with those who don’t seem to think critically about covid; and it’s helped me more than I could imagine. </p>
<p>We all want peace, and we are big/smart enough people to realize covid is another means of getting the common man to work against one another(similar to right vs left) so we stay distracted from the atrocities, injustices, and all around shittiness of the “elite”.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you said but the keeping to ourselves part. The only reason you’re on your smartphone at all is because there’s a role to play in the wealthys Pandora box. I’m about to run to the woods with nothing but a few books and a hatchet and I’m getting closer to doing it everyday. Sadly we need to play the game for a while. Collectively that is. If we all did what we wanted to do we would just be overreached by the fools. We need to stand up for those who need it. I do sympathize and I do realize people aren’t always ready. I realize we may hurt more than help most of the time but I feel like we might as well try and do a better job than those that solely shit on the cause</p>

        <p>I agree with you there and the only reason I’m participating in society is so I can legally run off into my own woods with a hatchet by the time I retire.</p>
<p>Although trying is important, I truly feel as if it’s a waste of time to go to other subs and try to push our own agenda, push it on the subs that revolve around our agenda, and then hope people get recommended our content and agree with it. Sadly the algorithms aren’t on our side, but still, it can’t hurt to try something else for a little!</p>
