    <strong>I got kicked out of the tram yesterday for wearing a mask "that does not protect"</strong>
    <p><p>TL;DR: Went in the tram with a mesh mask worn under my nose. Driver stopped the tram to scold me and ask me to wear it over my nose. An argument follows, he then decides to kick me out because he judges my mask not "protective enough". A lady in her sixties unexpectedly called him an asshole and decided to leave the tram in solidarity with me.</p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>As a bit of background, I bought one of these "breathable" masks made in mesh fabric as I no longer want to be part of the whole china flu hysteria in my country. The government has blocked people from outside the Schengen area from traveling to my country, even long-distance relationships. Which means that the government is blocking my girlfriend from moving in with me as we planned a while ago. This has now lasted more than a year. No one gives a shit about this, so I've decided to give 0 shit about others too.</p>
<p>Yesterday on my way to an anti-lockdown illegal protest, I got in the tram and was wearing <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hmQ9VKK">one of these masks</a> under my nose. Trams in my city have a specific section to enter and there's a booth inside the entrance with a person selling tram tickets. I had my music really loud in my ears and passed in front of the lady there which probably told me something about my mask. I didn't hear her cause I had music blasting in my ears, then they used the tram speaker I guess to scold me. Again, I had my music playing and couldn't hear what they said.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I see the tram driver closing his door and coming in the wagon. He was really aggressive and told me to wear my mask on my nose, and not under it. So I asked him if he was part of the "mask police" or something and then we argued some more, after which he said that my mask was not "protecting enough", to which I replied "and so are the cheap blue surgical ones".</p>
<p>We argued some more and I asked him if he, as a tram driver, was also the one in charge of defining the norms and rules about what's considered a mask by the government? Then after that he decided to kick me out. So I called him a few names, and all of a sudden, a lady in her sixties taps my shoulder...</p>
<p>At this point I really thought she was gonna combo me with the bus driver but things took an amazingly unexpected turn. She actually defended me and told the driver that he was an asshole because he earned a slight bit of power, and that masks don't work and that he should quit his crap. After that I left because I didn't want to block people, and she got up and the driver asked her what she was doing, to which she replied "I'm leaving too in solidarity, I don't to want ride your tram because you're an asshole".</p>
<p>Turns out she was also on her way to the protest. This lady made my day. Thank you kind lady.</p></p>

        <p>We walked to the protest together afterwards, I told her that she was the kindest person I've met in a while and what she did was absolutely amazing, and I thanked her many times. I felt so alone being in Western Europe and being anti-lockdown, it now looks like that the dam is slowly starting to crack.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm already in that group. Maybe I should get more active there. Also good to mention that my GF lives in Belarus, which went through some harsh revolution attempt a few months ago. Luckily I can still fly there, but honestly it's risky as it's the worst dictatorship in Europe and the "government" there could do anything to a westerner like me. On the other hand I love spending time with her, and everything is open there without restrictions (bars, restaurants, clubs, stadiums, etc...) so I guess it outweighs the risks lol.</p>

        <p>I actually had a neck gaiter as well, with which I tried to find a middle-ground solution with the driver. But since I had an "attitude" he still wanted to kick me out regardless. But now I've studied the ins and outs of the transport company rules and it says you have to wear a non-medical mouth mask and that's it. There's no definition of what a non-medical mouth mask is. Next time I'll refuse to leave and ask the driver to call the police. I'll be better prepared.</p>

<p>That's not the way. I'm in a similar position (though not nearly as bad), so know where you are coming from, but the worst doomer is really an ally whether they know it or not - they're far, far, <em>far</em> closer to us than the oligarchs coming after them. Against unprecedented hoovering-up of private wealth and assets, we have to do everything we can to stand together.</p>

        <p>Well, I guess we disagree on this point but that's totally okay! For me, doomers are the ones that are enabling these government policies. IMHO they are more to blame than the government itself, they are the ones which are listening, obeying and virtue signalling to all this non-sense. I believe, and this is personal, that COVID will end only once people have decided it will end. If tomorrow everyone stopped following the rules, governments would be powerless.</p>

        <p>Netherlands. The group that organizes protests here and with which I've demonstrated a couple of times just successfully sued the dutch government this morning over the legality of the curfew. The supreme court overturned it and police say they refuse to enforce it. What a victory!</p>

        <p>Ah guys we've found a cute little doomer here. Account created today, 3 negative posts on this sub. The rules in my city says travelers have to wear a non-medical mouth mask. And that's it. My mesh mask is a non-medical mouth mask. The receipt I got says "breathable <strong>mask</strong>" so it's a mask.</p>
<p>And I'm fine being labeled as an asshole by you. It's like real-life Reddit karma for me. It's an honor to be called an asshole, thank you.</p>
<p>Masks are the worst symbol of covid oppression. We are done with this one-way solidarity. Enough is enough.</p>

        <p>I find it more funny that your first sentences were aimed at doing a background check of my short profile. And calling me a "doomer" because suddenly the echo chamber comment chain got broke. Let's face it, the only problem here today was you not the tram driver. And I personally find the use of masks more of an inconvenience rather than oppression.</p>

        <p>“I personally find the use of masks more of an inconvenience than oppression” your inability to recognize when you’re being oppressed is why you’re gonna end up staring at your 4 walls for the next 5yrs. under house arrest scratching your head wondering wtf, how did this happen?? Leave the thinking to those of us experienced at it.</p>

        <p>Well I've been (apparently) under oppression since March 2020 and I'm currently doing fine, physically and mentally. I've been living my life inside and outside the house, doing my usual routines and endured two big lockdowns. Now I'm patiently waiting for my turn to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I could link two dozen articles, videos by eminent epidemiologists and dozens of peer reviewed articles that call this exactly what I just did. Here’s the rub. You read and cite everything that confirms your set opinion. The correct way to prove something is to set out to DISPROVE it. I think we’re done with each other now. You should probably get back to the flock before they come looking for you and find you in this sub.</p>

        <p>sure just ignore the fact that they were complying ere hassled because it was slightly down on their nose fuck you the bus driver was the asshole the older lady even perked up and told him what more do you fucking want </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I fucking hate people like you that say well it's a rule and everyone has to follow it so it just and your an asshole if you disagree.... </p>
<p>You have been indoctrinated since you were young to always comply I assume you went to public school and this is where this mentality was drilled into you if it was not a mask would be somethings because ally at the end of the day its a mentality on breaking rules we are disagreeing with here you think its rule everyone should follow and anyone who corrects someone cant be the bad guy right because its a rule!!!!!</p>
<p>You probably have this same mentality extended towards speeding and impairment laws and fines and clearly see how those are used for revenue generation in our society especially in places like Canada... Compared to us we have some of the craziest speeding and impairment law in Ontario it is nonsensical...  but sure you would defend it maybe not  maybe you like ars and see the oppression that goes on daily with speeding tickets and people driving in fear</p>

<p>“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”</p>

        <p>Mate, chill. I only said to the OP he is not special for not following the rules in a public transport where everyone is treated the same. Specially if you don't even know how to use a mask correctly after all this time. That's really it. And you really don't know anything about me, my education or where I live so no point speculating.</p>

Since you seem so much into protecting others, would you mind giving me a few tips on how you wear your anti-covid butt plug? Does the largest size fit you well? I really want to do my best here and protect grandmas from my covid farts, especially after I've had Taco Bell.
