<title>How do you counter the argument that wearing masks is too minimal of an inconvenience to be protesting over or object to since even a small chance it helps means it's a non issue? Also, a couple examples of what the public thinks of famous figures who go out without them.</title>

    <p><p>I ask this because when it comes to lockdowns, that's one issue where it's gradually being seen as obscene, unrealistic and unhelpful.  When it comes to masks, though, that seems to be entirely separate.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What I've read is pointing to at least 70 % of medical and science experts reaching the conclusion they work and can save lives and are a trivial issue.  Are there studies or evidence I'm not aware of pointing to the opposite conclusion?  Any time you're discussing covid policy, it's considered universally embraced that masks need to be mandated everywhere and only thugs would say otherwise.  If these does need to be countered,  how exactly do we do it and what data disproves it?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are examples of what happens when speaking out against masks and/or going out without them.  Olympian Kerri Walsh Jennings:  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEzirakF9iA/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CEzirakF9iA/</a>   who as you can see in this and other social media posts was designated a murderous sociopath for this.  And may well face calls to have her banned from the Olympics next year over this. Famed tennis star Novak Djokovic isn't faring much better: <a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1604668347576/novak-djokovic-blows-off-mask-social-distancing-in-spain-after-covid-incident">https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1604668347576/novak-djokovic-blows-off-mask-social-distancing-in-spain-after-covid-incident</a></p></p>

        <p>I think a morally mobilized citizenry perpetrating social tyranny is a little more than an inconvenience. “First they came for...” and all that.</p>

        <p>The Kerri Walsh Jennings example is interesting to me. One of her points was that mask and lockdowns could lead to forced vaccinations and health ids .this is proving to be on the table and probably already planned. I’m sure none of her fans apologized for calling her crazy and careless.</p>
