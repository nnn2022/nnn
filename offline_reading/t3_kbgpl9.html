    <strong>Health authority trying to take down my local butcher</strong>
    <p><p>I went into my butcher today where masks where I never wear a mask, nor do the staff. No signage, nothing. Just like old times.</p>
<p>Anyways, there was all this new dirty plexi glass up and stickers on the floor and a staff member I haven't seen in a long time was on, not wearing a mask and she frantically asked me to put a mask on.</p>
<p>I listened to her and waited my turn in line. I did not say anything about her not wearing one. I thought "one person not wearing one is better than none."</p>
<p>Anyway, I finished my transaction and she apologized and thanked me for putting it. She said that the health authorities had sent in undercover inspectors over the last week, counted every single person that wasn't wearing a mask and are fining them $250 per person. </p>
<p>I mentioned that never happens at Costco, and she said that she thinks there is some sort of plan going on to take down small businesses. I wholeheartedly agreed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If a small business asks you to wear a mask, they may be a doomer on a power trip, but they may be a single mother just trying to put food on the table and their business is being threatened. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Stay real, brothers and sisters.</p></p>

        <p>Yes of course. Executives at large companies are not all idiots. It is well known, accepted and documented that over-the-top regulations, or many small regulations, all produce a more significant and detrimental effect on small businesses much more than large ones.</p>
<p>A large corporation has the resources to field its own legal team, accountants, etc. They have the political and social capital to properly lobby officials from legislators to adjudicators at regulatory agencies (see also: regulatory capture). A small company does not. This is why you will see Intuit, owner of TurboTax, lobby to complicate the tax code.</p>

        <p>This is the Rona logic.</p>
<p>If I go to a small business, they have a box of masks at the entrance, wipe down the counter after every customer, count shoppers so they don't exceed capacity (where I live it is currently reduced capacity), etc. You walk into a big box store and no one is counting who comes and goes, no cleaning of the checkout counter, no masks at the entrance, nada. The blatant immunity of big box stores and "fuck you" to small businesses is enraging.</p>

        <p>I imagine this might've been a tactic in nazi concentrations camps, too, and other places.</p>
<p>Collective punishment so prisoners would police each other automatically.</p>
<p>Maybe the only part missing is a $1000 reward for the shop owner who actually calls the police on a maskless person.</p>
