        <p>Excess deaths is a stat practically tailored to lying. All you have to do is adjust the model of expected deaths and the excess goes up or down! Total mortality compared to previous years, adjusting for population growth is the only reasonable approach until we can truly assess mortality displacement.</p>

        <p>You seem to be under the incorrect assumption that there is one single correct way to calculate excess mortality, and that it does not and has not changed during the course of this last year.</p>
<p>To wit, a simple 5-year (time-weighted?) average adjusted for population growth would be a very bad predictor of mortality, given mortality displacement (dry tinder, harvesting) phenomena.  One very mild year by that calculation would imply even fewer deaths the following year, when in truth it ushers in more.</p>
<p>This is why the stat is so easy to manipulate.  The models can be adjusted to produce the desired result.  Even excepting malicious action, if the model is incorrect, or simply poor, then the excess deaths will be wrong.</p>
<p>Excess death stats are truly meaningless numbers, they aren't 'data.'</p>

        <p>As I said, yes, absolute deaths are the only useful metric.</p>
<p>Sadly with CDC-mandated erroneous reporting actually assigning causes to all of those is essentially impossible at this stage.  The trendy "within 30-60 days of any positive test that even the creator, Fauci, and the WHO said wasn't medically diagnostic" reporting is not meant to accurately capture data.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind, population adjusted, we're at mid-2000's level, despite a VERY soft 2019 flu season (which we had in common with most of Europe as well, this is the primary reason for elevated overall mortality).</p>
<p>Most of Europe, including Sweden, had overall mortality levels barely over the baseline, and obviously uncorrelated to measures taken.</p>

        <p>Sure the CDC could misattribute cause of death but it doesn't explain why there were 300,000 more deaths in 2020. What are you sources on Europes mortality levels?</p>

        <p>Euromomo is a start, but broadly the EU publishes more data than the US, so it's pretty easy to access. </p>
<p>Yes, more deaths than 2019. How many fewer did 2019 have than baseline? Those are all people likely to die in 2020.  How many extra violent crimes? Suicides? Drug overdoses? (sf was reporting more drug deaths than covid!) How many untreated heart attacks? Skipped chemo? There are a lot of things that contribute here, and because we don't have a lot of this data, any conclusions are premature or presumptive. Also, what is our current exposed population volume, which is to say, what will 2021 counts look like? We know the average covid-attributed death is over the average lifespan already, so it's likely that we've dug in to subsequent years elderly harvesting. (not my term.) </p>
<p>Basically, my problem with all of these discussions is someone, usually a politician or the media or a grad student with a mission decides to reduce the problem down to a single number, and you can only do that by losing information. Excess death as a concept, even total mortality tells one aspect of the story. </p>
<p>It's like looking at a rogue wave coming at you, bigger than all those you've seen before, and drawing conclusions based on one data point.</p>

        <p>How many excess suicides and overdose deaths were there in 2020? SF had more drug deaths because they had extremely low Covid deaths. The increase in homicides is partly from all the protests.</p>
<p>It's difficult to tell if the lockdowns saved more lives than they caused but the US isn't in a great place. They had 460,000 deaths WITH lockdowns, social distancing and mask mandates. How many would there be with no restrictions? Would it be less than the excess suicides, overdoses and missed treatments? I doubt it...</p>

        <p>Compare states and countries with lockdowns and masking to those that didn't.  There is ZERO correlation.  So any of this "what if there weren't lockdowns!?" hypothesizing is bunk.  The entire lockdown strategy has no scientific backing, whatsoever.  It sprung from a kid's science project.  It didn't exist before 2020, was inconceivable until China did it, then the western world wanted a piece of the authoritarian power and jumped on board.</p>
<p>So yes, lockdowns have been worse for every country in the world, because there's no evidence they've saved a single life, slowed the spread at all.  US lockdowns even impact places like Africa, due to lack of foreign aid, charities, medical support, etc.  Some international relief organizations expect 130+ MILLION ADDITIONAL people in extreme poverty because of these lockdowns.  That means maybe another 10 million starving to death, and far more in the malnutrition category.  Go look up some pictures of kids who haven't gotten enough to eat from the day they were conceived.  Then read up on missed vaccinations, missed chemo, missed cancer screenings, missed dental checkups.  Read up on increased poverty, the worst drop in low end income and employment since WWI.  </p>
<p>And drop the foolish excuses.  Crime is up in every city in the country, and it isn't riot crime, it's gang crime, because kids aren't in schools, people aren't in jobs.  It's also crime of desperation, theft of everything from foot to catalytic converters and home invasions.  Suicides are up because depression is up, hotline calls are up, people aren't going out, seeing each other, getting exercise and vitamin D.  Alcoholism and drug use are up for the same reasons, and always scale with unemployment.</p>
<p>Your death counts are still wrong.  If the only criteria for a covid tag on the certificate are a) because the attending physician thought so, even in the absence of a test, or b) a test that isn't medically diagnostic and needn't be even close to the death itself, the numbers are wrong.  Period.</p>
<p>These lockdowns and civil rights crimes are the worst thing to happen to the population in decades, all on behalf of a virus less lethal than the flus in the 50s and 60s, during which people lived their lives and attended woodstock.  And idiots are  cheering it on.</p>
<p>also, i'm done with this conversation, begone.</p>

        <p>Look at it from a scientific perspective. You can't really compare countries with vastly different population densities, cultures, and weather. It's like apples to oranges. Even states are difficult to compare. Look at states before and after lockdowns. You'll almost always see a drop in infection rates. The reason lockdowns have been so ineffective in the US is because they're widely misused and not enforced. Lockdowns should be a last resort to manage hospital capacities. Open-ended, half-assed lockdowns just delay the pain and leads to low compliance. </p>
<p>That being said, I'm for mask mandates because again, looking at the data you see a reduction in rates following mandates.</p>
