    <strong>What is the position of people on this sub regarding vaccine passports? [Serious]</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone, I found this sub while browsing discussion of the incoming restrictions in Los Angeles. I see a lot of advocacy for people to not wear masks if vaccinated and to ignore the request. From my perspective, the problem is that too little has been done to force the decisions of those who are choosing not to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>If vaccine passports were required to do many <strong>normal</strong> things or to do said things without a mask (in a normal way), I would be happy. There are small parts of society that will be unable to get vaccinated and there are large parts of the world that haven't had the opportunity yet. For those of us behaving responsibly to <em>truly</em> enjoy normal again, it can't be disrupted by selfish regressive behavior like being anti-vaccination. In my opinion, what we need is normal life for the responsible people with vaccine passports (proof is required otherwise people won't do it) and a new <em>abnormal</em> for irresponsible people. Hard, enforced, disparate rules like this are the only thing that will drive us back to normal for everyone because of the reticence of a large portion of the population to behave responsibly.</p>
<p>I don't want to live in a "new normal" like many of you, but I don't want unnecessary deaths or to have behavior going on needlessly that contributes in any way to the pandemic dragging out globally. Do you think something like vaccine passports and hard requirements would be a viable solution? What else would you propose besides general insubordination? I want to find constructive solutions.</p></p>

        <p>"Papers, please!" </p>
<p>If you advocate for vaccine passports, you're a Nazi. No ifs, ands, or buts. The Nazis created an enemy, named them enemies of the state, barred them from most public places, labeled them with a physical mark, and persecuted them.</p>
<p>And what do you want to do? Name unvaccinated as enemies of the state. Bar them from public places. The only thing you need to do is mark them somehow and send them to camps. But that's your plan, right?</p>
<p>"But this is a real virus!" The Nazis said the Jews were a menace on society. "But you can spread a virus to others!" The Nazis said the Jews were a parasite to the German people. "You're being anti-semitic!" Nope, I'm pointing out that repetition of history, and you're on the wrong side.</p>

        <p>Getting the vaccine would be irresponsible and selfish of me. I'm already immune, so I wouldn't be contributing anything to anyone else. Except a risk that I'll have severe side effects and take up medical resources that could have gone to someone else, end up on disability and be supported by taxpayers when it could easily have been prevented and I could have still been a net contributor, or both.</p>
<p>I am LESS likely to spread the virus than a vaccinated person who never caught the virus.</p>
<p>We don't need a "solution." People who prefer the vaccine risk over COVID risk can get the shot, people who prefer risking the disease over adverse reactions to the vaccine can say no thanks, and we're done.</p>
