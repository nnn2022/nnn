    <strong>Should I put off enrolling in college?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm 18, should I be going to college right now? Am I really going to give my hard-earned money to a corrupt education system that's going to push this agenda just as hard as the corrupt government? It doesn't feel right, but I don't know what to do.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I know. It's just hard because I had everything all lined up to go this fall and I've been working towards this for over a year, it's hard to just say "nevermind, I'll just get to it later." I wanted to study engineering and I'm not sure if that's possible outside of a traditional college institution.</p>

        <p>I went right away after hs. Dropped out. Went back few years later and graduated top of my class. It’s good to have goals but it’s also good to be open to changing them when shit happens and have a back up plan or two.</p>

        <p>Not if you don’t want to, I didn’t go to university until I was 21, and there were people in my class double my age. Don’t listen to people on the internet though, if you want to take a year or so off, you do you.</p>

        <p>I’ll be honest, I had no plan. I just worked part time and partied. It would be good to get some solid work experience before going. I always felt for my friends who went straight to university, then came out in the early to mid twenties, with no work experience whatsoever and no conception of the real world. I saw you wanted to go into engineering, you should apply for apprenticeships so you can work (and earn money) while learning</p>

        <p>Just know, you are young and lots of time yet. </p>
<p>I never went to college and have been in the same factory for 15 years. I am 35 and have been heavily debating school, I’ve tried finding new jobs I might like better but it’s all the same blue collar stuff that my resume fits. So if I do it I want to do it ASAP before I get much older. </p>
<p>But I want to go for IT or something that’s needed in the future, yea it costs a lot of money, but if you have a goal and know what you want to do it could be for the better, like at my job we have IT but I’m not aloud to try because I don’t have a diploma </p>
<p>Don’t go to school just to go, that’s how many of my friends wasted money, they just wanted to party and didn’t take stuff that really benefited them after, I have changed my career thinking many times over the years and I’m kind of glad I didn’t pursue stuff I thought about in my early 20s </p>
<p>My only concern is all the uncertainty of more lockdowns, possible cyber attack to disrupt the economy etc, my local college already said they aren’t mandating the vax but much stricter rules for those who dont. </p>
<p>I am looking to maybe start in January if things don’t go bad. </p>
<p>One suggestion tho, if you decide to wait and work for a while, do not put yourself into debt, do not take out a 30k car loan like I did just before the 2009 recession. That really set me back and one reason I’m not even considering it until 35 </p>
<p>The pandemic is here, we have to still live our lives and not worry about what might happen in 2022 or further, keep it in the back of your mind so you are mentally prepared if it happens, but by avoiding school out of fears of “what if” just holds you back too </p>
<p>Just be smart what you take has something at the end for you and isn’t going to be obsolete with the Reset (tho that’s hard to predict) </p>
<p>But you can also be successful and make good money without school too, Main thing is that you are happy with what you do, sometimes it’s better to make a few dollars less and be happier</p>

        <p>This is all really good advice, thank you, truly. I've been thinking about that last part a lot recently. I really don't care about my salary, as long as I can live on it and hopefully support a family one day. I just want to find something I love, and it's really hard to know what that thing is at 17 or 18 years old. I know that I love math and science, which is why I'm planning on going into engineering, assuming I attend college this year. I wish you best of luck with whatever you decide to do next, whether it be school for IT or anything else!</p>

        <p>I'm a prof at a state university. I've found that students who attend college later in life perform better. Probably not a bad idea to wait it out, find yourself, learn some real-world skills in the meantime, and then decide if college is even worth it.</p>

        <p>Will you go into debt if you do? If so don’t. Find out what you wanna do first before you enroll and you’ll be way better off even if it takes a year or 2. Use this time to decide what you want to do, maybe a 2 year program that specializes in the field you want to go on will be more beneficial. A lot of kids go to college for a couple years decide it’s not for them and drop out and are left with tons of debt. You’ll be ahead if you don’t go to college until you decide what you want to do first rather then wasting money on classes you’ll never use. College is a lot of the time a total scam. You should wait until you know exactly what you want to do before you enroll. That or if you’re real set on college, find a community college, get your general education credits knocked out, make sure they will 100% transfer to the college you will end up at. While you’re doing your gen eds figure out what you’ll major and minor in.</p>

        <p>If you can financially do it, start college now. But don't pick a college just by the name, that doesn't mean anything later on when you are looking for a job, except to be accepted by liberals you shouldn't be working for anyway.</p>
<p>Also, boycott colleges that require mask or vaccine for in person learning, even if not required for online study.</p>

        <p>My college is requiring masks for in-person, but I genuinely don't know what I am proving by choosing not to attend or boycotting them. To them, they just lost a few pennies, and if I try to tell anyone I decided not to go because I didn't want to wear a mask, everyone will think I had a neurotic break because people are all so brainwashed to believe masks save us when I know thats a lie. It feels like a no-win situation</p>

        <p>The way we communicate our will to businesses is with money. We can't complain about Facebook censoring people and still have an account, we can't complain about Netflix and still support them monthly. They keep doing the things they are doing because most people don't care enough to move out and that incentivizes them to do more of it.</p>
<p>You may think that your penny is worthless but if 40% of the population decided to say enough is enough and stops supporting businesses that are clearly against them, this situation would change overnight.</p>
<p>Besides, colleges that are taking a stance and not requiring a mask are going against the flow and risking to lose everything. These companies deserve our support.</p>
<p>Don't care too about what others think, you don't have to give them all the reasons why you are making a particular decision. They might be too brainwashed, so just don't waste your words. Just be generic and say you have done some research and thought they were better.</p>
<p>Do try to find people you can talk to about these things, it helps to communicate to like minded individuals.</p>
<p>Above all else, please get to know Jesus Christ if you haven't done so. Everything in this life is temporary, but our souls are eternal. Make sure yours is heading towards heaven through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>God bless!!</p>

        <p>You are right about communicating with money, I agree. The problem is, I truly believe that this school has a great program for my engineering major, but now I also know they are deeply involved with this evil plot to destroy our country, much like every other public institution today. This seemed like the perfect school for me in terms of pretty much all factors, except those involving covid, which is what makes this decision so hard for me. I want to take a stand but I know it won't have any effect in the grand scheme of things, only a calculated and coordinated uprising of tens of millions of Americans could turn this country around this point...</p>
<p>And it's troubling to have so few people in my life that think the way I do about this "pandemic". I am beyond blessed to have my few immediate family members, but apart from that, everyone in my life is beyond brainwashed and it's difficult to watch much longer.</p>
<p>And AMEN! Jesus is Lord. I'm having a very difficult time with maintaining a strong relationship with God these past few months, but I know that the more I trust Him, the easier this will all become. It's very hard for me to put my future into His hands and let go of what I want for my life, in fact it's close to impossible. That's something I'm working on right now.</p>
<p>And thank you, your comments have been very insightful and I appreciate the help. God bless you too!</p>

        <p>If at a good school... Maybe, as long as you don't have to get the vax. Just keep your head down wherever you go, get your golden ticket.</p>
<p>I went to law school and turned out well, but law firms are already requiring it. Gonna be rough ahead. Getting an education is important for some people, but when you're 18, you can afford to hold off and think about it for a half a year/year/2 years, just working and saving money in the meantime</p>
