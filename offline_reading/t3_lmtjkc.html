        <p>I thought they updated the definition last summer once this was identified. Now it’s anyone who tested positive within the past 28 days I believe. Still means you could get hit by a bus and be claimed as a covid death.</p>

        <p>It used to be anybody who got it at any time, so they could have and probably would have kept it going for years. Then Public Health England got shamed into changing it to 28 days, and for some reason they also got rid of (or consolidated) PHE at the same time. At least they require a test, though. In the US, you don't even need that.</p>

        <p>If a person had the “vaccine” five mins before dying I’m assuming in the official stats it is still a “with covid death” (tested +‘ve 60 days earlier) and not related at all to the vaccine  in official records. Is this correct???</p>

        <p>Reporting any death within 28 days of that person testing positive for COVID-19 as a COVID-19 death certainly isn't a perfect criteria for classifying deaths caused by the disease, but using some maths you can prove the vast majority of these reported deaths were indeed by caused by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Lets use the UK for example. In the UK, there was a total 616,000 deaths in 2018. These can be classified as non-Covid related deaths. 616,000/365 = 1,688 non-Covid related deaths per every day on average. 1688 * 28 = 47,254 non-Covid related deaths every 28 days on average.</p>
<p>There are 66.65 million people living in the UK, so 47,254/66,650,000 = 7.09*10^(-4) as the fraction of the total population that die every 28 days for non-Covid related reasons. This is equal to the probability of a random person being selected of the UK general population dying within the next 28 days.</p>
<p>As of the 10th of February 3,985,161 people in the UK have tested positive for COVID-19. From the probability above we should then expect that approximately 3,985,161 * 7.09*10^(-4) = 2,825 of these people to have died within the next 28 days from non-Covid related reasons. Overall 114,851 of these people died within the next 28 days, which means only approximately 2,825/114,851 = <strong>2.46%</strong> of COVID-19 reported deaths were caused by non-Covid related reasons. Hence the vast majority were not.</p>

        <p>Don't all patients get tested when they enter the hospital, regardless of illness/injury? If they die in the hospital (with a positive test) they'll be marked as a covid death.</p>

        <p>As far as I am aware in the UK patients will only be tested if they go into hospital with one of the three symptoms (cough, fever, loss of taste or smell).</p>
