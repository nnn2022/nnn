    <strong>The ridiculous plans in Porto, Portugal, for the city holiday</strong>
    <p><p>Every year, on the night of June 23, there's this big city holiday "São João". Fireworks, concerts, food, you name it. It's one of the biggest nights of the year. This year, well, it's what you expect of the beloved "New Normal".</p>
<p>Fireworks cancelled, no live shows, reduced public transportation, a bridge that's going to be closed to nudge people to travel less, fancy outdoors telling people this year the party is at home (using attractive images has been what the City Hall has been doing for a while now, so sad [<a href="http://www.porto.pt/noticias/campanha-de-mupis-ficaemcasa-esta-por-toda-a-cidade-em-700-posicoes">1</a>] [<a href="http://www.porto.pt/noticias/sao-joao-campanha-de-comunicacao-reforca-a-mensagem-de-que-este-ano-a-festa-celebra-se-em-casa">2</a>]), several stores closing by 7pm and restaurants by 11pm (gotta get the adults to bed!).</p>
<p>Oh, and there's a big football (soccer) match between FC Porto and Boavista FC - no fans of course because that's what you get when you combine modern football (€€€) and a terrible pandemic response. I heard a while back they were going to set up a drive-in to watch the game on a big screen.</p>
<p>I'm going to ask my friends and see who wants to go out. There's plenty of young people that hang out at night after bars close at 11pm, which I think is awesome.</p>
<p>For context, Portugal is no longer in strict lockdown, there's people eating on restaurants &amp; bars and going on walks; some use masks outside, most don't. They're required in some places. Beaches are being featured with crowd control portals, signs telling people how far away their towels have to be from one another and one-way "corridors".</p>
<p>But hey, it's okay, we've got to #savegrandma and socially distance even though it makes no sense. Wake me up ~~when September ends~~ <em>Whenever Things Go Back To Normal</em>.</p></p>

        <p>The continuing mass-cancellation of events and closure of public recreation and businesses operating at "partial capacity" is disturbing to me, especially since shit's cancelled many months in advance in some instances. Here in WI the cancellations and closures keep rolling despite us not being under any sort of lockdown or mandate at all for over a month. It's costing many towns a severe amount of tourist revenue.</p>

        <p>In Toronto the mayor was already calling for the 'Santa clause parade' to be cancelled already in March when this started.  The parade isn't until November.</p>

        <p>I think many events are being cancelled months in advance because of financial issues caused by the current lockdown (eg the organisation running it has less revenue, or expects they won't be able to afford the event), or because businesses they rely upon (eg venues/catering etc) are being affected by the virus. It's also caused by the government's inability to provide any sort of exit plan or timeline, so that it's impossible to plan (imagine if the rolling lockdown plan was implemented...). The problem is, it's hard to distinguish between events cancelled due to "fear of the virus" vs events cancelled due to consequences of the lockdown.</p>

        <p>Whilst every music festival was being canceled, there was one that kept the July 2020 date. Only a couple of weeks ago did they postpone until 2021 as mass events are not allowed (but you can already go to an indoor concert with a mask, go figure).</p>
