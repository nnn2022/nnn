    <strong>What is supposed to be the "Wave" and how do they predict it so scarinlgly accurate.</strong>
    <p><p>Edit : my question may not be clear. My point is I know they predict the waves and manipulate using PCR to show the cases match with their propaganda.
But what scientific explanation or narrative they give to people about how they predict the wave. 
On what basis these stupid people believe the government is predicting cases  not conducting the covid drama .
I know all the shit is their planned propaganda, but i am asking what is their explanation of them.</p>
<p>I am in India and here the MMS are telling  , in October to September we can expect "3rd wave of covid" which will attack and be a major threat to children.
Just Before this 2nd wave  they said the second wave spread to rural areas and they will be the most affected since the first wave mainly affected the cities.</p>
<p>Now what is it I am asking is - 
1.how do they tell when the wave is supposed to happen. Any scientific explanations? Assuming the "wave" is supposed to mean large no of peoples affected by covid , that means According to the narrative very unusually huge gathering of people should cause the supposed "wave" . 
2.how  they predict that 1st wave affects city , 2nd wave affects rurals , 3rd wave affects children.
If they claim that city people get vaccine before in rural - then why the covid should wait untill 3rd wave to affect children , why not affect them in the 2nd wave itself. Why their boss told to mutate and attack only when told so.
And how do people even believe this stuff , like how they predict forthcoming random  events , given all the variables in the equation also have random probability.</p>
<p>TL;DR : why the waves of covid affect people exactly according to the scientists "prediction". Time and type included.</p></p>

        <p>That doesn't seem to be logical since rural environments are natural "social distancing" settings.  Too much is being accepted at face value.</p>

        <p>Well, we hear about positive cases... But, we never have access to further info like how many cycles on the pcr were run to get that positive. If you run the pcr 35 cycles and above you can make any sample test positive to whatever you want, as per the inventer of the pcr. They control the testing so they control the numbers. If they control the numbers they can make seemingly accurate predictions.</p>
