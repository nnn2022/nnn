<title>Compare the U.K. government’s information pack for “health care professionals” to the one for “recipients”...interesting omissions relating to fertility. Something they’re not telling us, or simply information they do not have yet, due to limited testing?</title>

    <strong>Compare the U.K. government’s information pack for “health care professionals” to the one for “recipients”...interesting omissions relating to fertility. Something they’re not telling us, or simply information they do not have yet, due to limited testing?</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/941452/Information_for_healthcare_professionals.pdf">Information for Healthcare Professionals on Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</a></p>
<p>PDF, 361KB, 10 pages:</p>
<p>“4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</p>
<p>Pregnancy</p>
<p>There are no or limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2. Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy.</p>
<p>For women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be excluded before vaccination. In addition, women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 2 months after their second dose.</p>
<p>Breast-feeding</p>
<p><strong>It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should not be used during breast-feeding.</strong></p>
<p>Fertility</p>
<p><strong>It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility.”</strong></p>
<p>Compared to the version for recipients:</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/940566/Information_for_UK_recipients_on_Pfizer_BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/940566/Information_for_UK_recipients_on_Pfizer_BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine.pdf</a>  </p>
<p>which has a more vague and limited mention of possible fertility issues:</p>
<p>“Pregnancy and breast-feeding</p>
<p>There is currently limited data available on the use of this vaccine in pregnant women. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine. As a precaution, you should avoid becoming pregnant until at least 2 months after the vaccine.”</p>
<p>Both pdf documents can be found here, on the U.K. government’s website:</p>

        <p>“The vaccinations are expected to produce antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, spike proteins also contain <strong>syncytin-homologous proteins</strong>, which are essential for the formation of the placenta in mammals such as humans. It must be absolutely ruled out that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, as otherwise <strong>infertility of indefinite duration could result in vaccinated women</strong>.“</p>

<p>The risks are unknown due to lack of testing and the importance of maintaining plausible deniability if/ when the truth is revealed. Who - besides U.K. government media figures - is still thinking faster is better, when it comes to vaccines? However hard they try, being first makes you a guinea pig and cannon fodder. It is NOT a cause for celebration.</p>

<p>“In 2027, in a chaotic world in which women have become somehow infertile, a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea. No children. No future. No hope. In the year 2027, eighteen years since the last baby was born, disillusioned Theo (Clive Owen) becomes an unlikely champion of the human race when he is asked by his former lover (Julianne Moore) to escort a young pregnant woman out of the country as quickly as possible. In a thrilling race against time, Theo will risk everything to deliver the miracle the whole world has been waiting for. Co-starring Michael Caine, filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men "Lifts you to the rafters, transporting you with the greatness of its filmmaking. The action is swift, ferocious and spectacularly choreographed." (The New York Times) In a grim future in which humans can no longer reproduce, one woman mysteriously becomes pregnant, and a conflicted bureaucrat fights to protect her.”</p>
