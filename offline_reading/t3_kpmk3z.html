        <p>Lets flip the script for a second. Lets say the media favored the ‚Äúno mask‚Äù narrative, lets also pretend COVID was deadly and that cloth masks actually worked. Now that were in pretend land, imagine everyone around you didnt wear masks and you were one of the few who did. You feel so deeply about your decision that you take to social media talking about how masks work and will protect from deadly COVID. To your surprise, Twitter and Facebook flag your posts. Put a filter over them with a link to a ‚Äúfact-check‚Äù page that literally put a strange twist on logic and calls it the truth. You take to social media again and try to start a peaceful protest for people to start wearing masks. To your surprise, you get some people clicking the ‚Äúplan to attend‚Äù button and then suddenly the function is shut down and reported for ‚Äúinciting a riot‚Äù. The science is clear though? Why would the media push a certain narrative and social media platforms silence any other opinion? You tell me.</p>
<p>This is not even science fiction anymore.</p>

        <p>Even if that were the case, you're tellingly leaving the most important thing out of the equation: science. To you it's so important what the media and social media says, and imagine a world where they said the opposite.</p>
<p>In reality (as in your example), we should not follow what anyone else is saying about a medical subject besides the medical experts.</p>
<p>I was originally anti-wearing masks. Then the studies came. Fauci flipped because the masks were proven to be effective. Countless medical organizations showed the proof of mask effectiveness.</p>
<p>And then we realized that not wearing masks was the dangerous thing to do. We saw how there was a steady decline when masks were added to the equation.</p>
<p>The only thing I could do was to change my stand on masks, look up how to wear them, how to take care of them, and started using them.</p>
<p>We have multiple cases proving mass gathering without masks can easily become superspreader events, even at the White House. The only thing that social media can do is to try and inform people with questionable information about the actual science, and block out people using their platform to organize events that could potentially kill people to avoid becoming liable.</p>
<p>To go back to your argument tho, if I was in that scenario that you made up, I'd seriously consider why is it that I'm having an opposite opinion than everyone else. What am I basing my beliefs on? Do k think it's a matter of personal opinion, or science? Am I basing what I believe on actual science, the scientific method, and trustworthy experts and studies?</p>
<p>Have you asked yourself those questions?</p>

        <p>Upvoted for wanting to have a civil discussion. People should do this more on reddit. Anyways, I practiced medicine for several years and now I teach it. Part of our curriculum is learning about PPE. N-95 masks (medical grade) actually do block out viruses like COVID. That is irrefutable. So if you are rocking one of those, more power to you! But is that the end all be all? No sir. Wearing proper PPE requires gloves, mask, eye pro, and the works depending on the bodily substances/diseases your at risk of being exposed to. Meaning to fully protect ourself from a virus like COVID that spreads through tiny air droplets, we would need to wear an N-95 mask, goggles, and gloves. We would also need to don and doff them appropriately as well as be properly fitted for each item in order to actually protect from exposure. Thats the cold hard truth and I think anyone willing to think on it would realize that. Continuing on, what the media is pushing is that CLOTH masks provide that same level of protection that a full medical grade ensemble would against COVID. Thats just lunacy. Ive yet to see one shred of actual peer reviewed evidence that even suggest CLOTH masks provide full protection from exposure. Touching now on the decline you mentioned, I think its safe to assume you are talking about the decline as we went into the summer months? Then that same decline turned to a steep incline as we entered the winter months with no change to mask mandates? Ill leave that there and let you work it out. It was not the masks, it was the weather. Next point about super-spreader events, whether or not masks are worn, without social distancing, COVID will spread unless everyone wears a full PPE ensemble donned and doffed appropriately. I also want to note, infection does not translate to death. 1% of people infected actually die and less than 10% of the United States has even contracted the virus. Last point, I have wondered why. I did loads of research and consulted my peers who ALSO wondered why. We all did research and could not find an answer as to why the media and even some doctors (virtue signalers, dont even believe it themselves) were saying on TV that cloth masks would protect against COVID. Or say things like ‚ÄúCOVID is the deadliest virus evers‚Äù with a straight face. The conclusion I eventually came to was that it was dishonest and the media was trying to use cloth masks as a placebo to make people feel safe while all the N-95s that actually work are sent to medical personnel. Havent you ever wondered why cloth masks arent good enough for medical workers and first responders?</p>

        <p>Let me start by pointing something out. You say that, to be properly protected against COVID-19, you'd need to wear gloves as part of your PPE. However, COVID-19 doesn't go through the skin, and I haven't found any evidence linking towards its effectiveness against COVID instead of simply washing your hands for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>If you wanted to wear gloves instead, you could just end up spreading the virus all over as soon as you touch a surface with it. Obviously in COVID units where you wear those for as long as you're inside, spreading the virus is of little concern, because the whole area is already filled with viruses, and because of all of the extensive cleaning they do. However, in any other environment, washing hands is far better, but I'm open to see any studies that proves that wrong.</p>
<p>Second, you talk about how cloth masks aren't as effective as N95. You are right. No one should ever wear a cloth mask thinking it's protecting them as much as an N95 mask. That is factually incorrect and you are right to say that anyone saying the opposite is lying.</p>
<p>We can extrapolate from it to say that doctors seeing COVID-19 patients should always wear those masks and those masks alone, so you are 100% correct on that too.</p>
<p>Now, you also said that COVID "spreads through tiny air droplets". That is also correct and it is, in fact, the main reason behind wearing masks. Wearing masks prevents those droplets to be released into the air in the first place, which is the main reason why organizations like the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html">CDC advises to wear masks</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, cloth masks also protect the wearer somewhat, with an effectiveness of about 50% according to multiple studies, some listed by the CDC as well. This is also important because the more viruses get into your body, the worse the disease will get. However, this should be looked (and branded by the media) as more of an added bonus, and never as the main reason to wear a mask.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of masks isn't just my opinion or the CDC's opinion. You've practiced medicine, so you know the importance and value of meta analysis studies. Here's one meta analysis <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext">published by Lancet</a> looking at well over 25 thousand people, showing how "<em>Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection</em>". <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.16.20214171v1">Another meta analysis</a>  found that "<em>wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection"</em> and concluded that "<em>wearing a mask could reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection</em>".</p>
<p>And that's just to name a couple.</p>
<p>So, we've found that masks aren't primarily work for the protection the offer to the wearer but for the protection the offer to everyone else. Let me talk about your last point of how only 1% of the population actually dies of COVID. That is also correct and it may be even a lower percentage according to some studies, but that argument is somewhat misleading.</p>
<p>In reality, the percentage of people that ends up hospitalized is anywhere between 3-5%. That doesn't sound like much, but with 7 billion people, 3% makes a more obvious difference. That's why around the world countries have struggled to keep up with the demand. In a country with 328 million people, you can't just drop 9 million extra patients in the healthcare system without a warning, you need to spread them out by flattening the hospitalization curve and increasing capacity.</p>
<p>Finally, the reason why I personally hate the 1% argument is because that's not how we do things. </p>
<p>If we take all of the serial killers throughout the history of the USA, identified or unidentified, and you add up all of their victims, you'll get about 3600 people. That's 0.001% of the population. However, the government has spent literally hundreds of millions of dollars catching them and bringing them to justice.</p>
<p>We don't say "hey why don't they spend that money elsewhere instead of looking for and catching serial killers that only kill 0.001% of the population", right? Because those are preventable deaths. If a single life is prevented, then it's worth it.</p>
<p>COVID is far deadlier than a serial killer, and, unlike those, we can all do something to prevent it from killing as many people as it can. While wearing masks isn't 100% effective, it has been proven to be effective enough to make a difference. </p>
<p>Why wouldn't you wear one?</p>

        <p>Covid-19 (as described by the media, and as meant in common every day usage) is NOT real. They are describing a disease with a 1-5% death rate, scary and frequent long term effects including "brain fog", symptoms like "covid toes", with the possibility of reinfection. There is no other way to put it than to say that this disease simply does not exist. </p>
<p>The virus, SARS-CoV-2, is very much real and causes a wide range of extremely typical common cold symptoms similar to any other coronavirus, up to and including death in those with pre-existing conditions.</p>

<p>https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/</p>
<p>https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruseshttps://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses</p>
<p>Here are key anchor points to the extensive scientific literature that establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., "N95") does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009) "Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial," American Journal of Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 - 419.
N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Cowling, B. et al. (2010) "Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review," Epidemiology and Infection, 138(4), 449-456. DOI:10.1017/S0950268809991658
None of the studies reviewed showed the benefit of wearing a mask in either HCW or community members in households (H). See summary Tables 1 and 2 therein.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ bin-Reza et al. (2012), "The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence," Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 257-267.
"There were 17 eligible studies. [...] None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against inÔ¨Çuenza infection."</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Smith, J.D. et al. (2016) "Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute respiratory infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis", CMAJ Mar 2016, cmaj.150835; DOI: 10.1503/cmaj.150835
"We identified 6 clinical studies ... In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in the associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, or (c) reported work-place absenteeism."</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Offeddu, V. et al. (2017) "Effectiveness of Masks and Respirators Against Respiratory Infections in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis," Clinical Infectious Diseases, Volume 65, Issue 11, 1 December 2017, Pages 1934-1942, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix681</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Radonovich, L.J. et al. (2019) "N95 Respirators vs. Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel: A Randomized Clinical Trial", JAMA. 2019; 322(9): 824-833. DOI:10.1001/jama.2019.11645
"Among 2862 randomized participants, 2371, completed the study and accounted for 5180 HCW-seasons. ... Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs. medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza."</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Long, Y. et al. (2020) "Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis", J Evid Based Med. 2020; 1- 9. https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12381</p>
<p>No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions. Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there were any benefit to wearing a mask, because of the blocking power against droplets and aerosol particles, then there should be more benefit from wearing a respirator (N95) compared to a surgical mask, yet several large meta-analyses, and all the RCT, prove that there is no such relative benefit. Masks and respirators do not work.
Many potential harms may arise from broad public policies to wear masks, and the following unanswered questions arise:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Do used and loaded masks become sources of enhanced transmission, for the wearer and others?
‚Ä¢ Do masks become collectors and retainers of pathogens that the mask wearer would otherwise avoid when breathing without a mask?
‚Ä¢ Are large droplets captured by a mask atomized or aerosolized into breathable components? Can virions escape an evaporating droplet stuck to a mask fiber?
‚Ä¢ What are the dangers of bacterial growth on a used and loaded mask?
‚Ä¢ How do pathogen-laden droplets interact with environmental dust and aerosols captured on the mask?
‚Ä¢ What are long-term health effects on HCW, such as headaches, arising from impeded breathing?
‚Ä¢ Are there negative social consequences to a masked society?
‚Ä¢ Are there negative psychological consequences of wearing a mask, as a fear-based behavioral modification?
‚Ä¢ What are the environmental consequences of mask manufacturing and disposal?
‚Ä¢ Do the masks shed fibers or substances that are harmful when inhaled?</p>

        <p>Could everyone else who thinks this just reply to this comment thread please? I have found this entire sub to be an excellent source of people to block, but it takes a long time scrolling through all the comments to find the morons. so if you could all just get into an orderly line and reply to this I'll happily go through and block you all in one swoop and be done with it all.</p>
