    <strong>Are we really that unique?</strong>
    <p><p>Do you get that feeling like you’re living in a twilight zone episode? Like it feels like everyone around has lost their minds and they’re completely willing to go along with such inane and insanely limiting ridiculous illogical rules, and not only go along with them, but also police and enforce them! People I respected, people I thought were smart people, who I thought were people who could think for themselves, people who I had good morals and a sense of right and wrong. </p>
<p>Are we really that unique in seeing the world this way? </p>
<p>Unique in not being afraid to question and go against the grain? </p>
<p>Unique in our perspective or our strength to voice it? </p>
<p>It’s staggering when I see reports that 80 some-odd percent of people support shit like masking and home invasions and sex and travel restrictions. Had it really come to this? When did everyone go from rooting for the underdog and embracing individuality to this? I read old books and see old photos, shows, and movies and things definitely weren’t always this way. When did everyone start to suck so bad?</p></p>

        <p>I do feel like I'm living in the Twilight Zone. Sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier being totally ignorant like the masses seem to be. But being extremely afraid that a virus is going to kill me or loved ones can't be much fun either. So I'm not sure.</p>

        <p>I have yet to interact with another human, in person, who expresses any degree of informed skepticism or nonconformity with the ever-increasing laundry list of proclamations and mandates. </p>
<p>The NPC meme is real, y'all. At least 80% of people simply accept what the government tells them at face value and do as they're instructed. Ironically, sickeningly hilariously, the NPCs don't even have human faces any more, just the endless blank mask face. Real life has become GTA3, where you walk through the world seeing the same dozen low res pedestrian models repeating over and over.</p>

        <p>Gosh, yes, I feel that. Worried it will regress to people wearing the same anti-covid grey sack-cloth. Fortunately, it seems any big change in society has come from 10% or less of a population. Those 80% of easily swayed NPC's can, and will, in time be swayed back to freer lives, not that it makes any difference to them.</p>
<p>When Bruce Lee says 'Be Like Water' I consider those 80% follow the advice, except in their case, the water is stagnant.</p>

        <p>I know a lady in her 80s who is very offended over seeing lower-socioeconomic people not wearing masks. She seems to believe they are more likely to be diseased. Yes, she’s in a high-risk demographic. It just feels like she’s  already lived a long, good, fun non-restricted life and doesn’t seem care about the dystopian societal norms that further generations will have to deal with in order for her to feel “safe.”</p>

<p>Well, that's offensive... but there's a grain of truth in there somewhere.  Poverty can sometimes make eating low-nutrition, low-quality food unavoidable.  And that can lead to weakened immune systems.</p>

        <p>Most 60+ people I know are the most hysterical. To be fair, they are at higher risk, but much of their risk also comes from lifestyle choices. Getting old isn't a choice. Sitting on your ass, eating McDonald's, getting drunk or popping pills, watching the news or browsing Facebook all day.....that's all on you. They clearly don't care about their overall health, why care so much about COVID?</p>

        <p>Well they just had to cancel the spectator portion of a car race in Indiana because 125k people were planning to attend. Doubtful any of those people are the ones fear mongering the hardest.</p>
<p>When I turn off the internet and leave my house, I gather that the people I see out and about are pondering the same thing. I don’t think people know what to make of it.</p>
<p>I have some friends that have shocked me in their fear of this but I get the sneaking suspicion that they maybe so anti-trump that they’re just playing along with the fear because if they come out and say it’s all garbage, they’ll get crucified by their fellow leftist pals. And I have one friend couple who were germaphobes before this so I’ve basically mourned them, at least for the next 2 years. I wouldn’t turn down a call to hang out at any time but I’m not gonna go out of my way to provoke it because they’re probably on another level. </p>
<p>In general I think the powers that be did a good enough job getting people to comply to avoid being shamed. I don’t think as many people agree as we think but they’re just trying to get by and can’t handle a mob coming for them if they speak up. So people are just going out and doing stuff without talking about it and normalcy will come back because enough people keep buying into things and going out to do stuff and aren’t hiding away. They just are no longer announcing it on social media.</p>

        <p>It’s totally about not being shamed. If everything was open normally, I would be out having fun happily accepting the risk without a care in the world and if ended up getting sick I would stay home just like I would if I had the flu.</p>

        <p>Yes but that's exactly the problem, you should care about it because it's not the flu. If you end up sick whatever your age there are chances to die (and stop telling me "yes but it's only x,x% if you are x years old"</p>
<p>You'd be that happy to gamble your life on that small percentage of dying ?</p>
<p>And if not dying, you could have everlasting damages to your organ due to the virus attacking your whole body.</p>
<p>I can't understand how people can act careless when we haven't even discovered a way to cure it definetly or even discovered at what extent this virus affects us.</p>
<p>I know the whole situation is blown out of proportion but I can't overlook people being as misinformed as you are</p>

        <p>So you don't care what the chances of death are? </p>
<p>You just want to be Chicken Little "THE SKY IS FALLING!" </p>
<p>Real stats DO matter. We drive everyday because the small chance of dying is a worthy risk for getting where we want to go faster. We (typically) do NOT drive with inoperable brakes, because the chances of dying would be too great.</p>
<p>Covid death rate is super low. Lower than most other diseases, including the basic flu. Most people who get it won't even have symptoms. Most of the rest who have symptoms will get well on their own without a doctor or special medications. For the small percentage who are high risk, there are proven treatments like HCQ+Axithromyacim+zinc that are as close to a cure as you'll ever get.</p>
<p>BECAUSE YOU CAN'T "CURE" A VIRUS!</p>
<p>There's no cure for the common cold. There's no cure for the flu either. And, say it with me, MANY more people die of it each year than COVID. And we even have a "vaccine" for it! (The yearly flu shot)</p>
<p>Why people, who are really just scared and can't think critically, act so arrogant and call others misinformed is a class in human psychology and cult programming.</p>

        <p>I can't fathom the fact that the most common argument I had so far was : "It doesn't kill that many people". We're literally at an early stage of the pandemy not even a year has passed and you act like it's a done deal all of a sudden. It still kills people, what... Isn't that important enough ? No matter what even compares to other causes of death.</p>
<p>And if you want to use that argument atleast I invite you to use to correct data, it has been reported that since when COVID appeared and now, the 3rd cause of deaths in the U.S. is COVID.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Real stats DO matter. We drive everyday because the small chance of dying is a worthy risk for getting where we want to go faster. We (typically) do NOT drive with inoperable brakes, because the chances of dying would be too great. </p>
<p>That analogy doesn't work, you literally countered your own argument in the same sentence. There is a small chance to die while driving sure, but there's a reason we have brakes as you said ? To prevent it ? (See it as reducing your outdoor visits)<br>
We have roads, we have laws, rules to respect, you cannot just go ahead and drive in reverse. We have traffic enforcement camera to see if an individual was goinig over the limit. Realize how we have all those things and yet car accidents remain in the first places in terms of death even though having all these guidelines to follow.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Covid death rate is super low. Lower than most other diseases, including the basic flu. </p>
<p>That's completely untrue.  You have to use correct metrics and not compare them with total of deaths and compare them with death annually, the highest death toll recorded in the US with people dying with the flu was in 2017-2018 and reached 60 000 deaths that year. COVID killed 160 000 americans and we're halfway in the year.</p>
<p>Please follow that youtube video, it will properly show you any statistics about the comparison of death rates between COVID and other cause of deaths :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S7k62oK-38&amp;feature=emb_title">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S7k62oK-38&amp;feature=emb_title</a> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Why people, who are really just scared and can't think critically, act so arrogant and call others misinformed is a class in human psychology and cult programming. </p>
<p>The amount of projection is incredibly high here, all considering I was answering to that particular individual in that matter and generalized at any point. He pointed that after getting COVID he would just go home like it's the flu when he could be indefinetly be hospitalized for it, yes you can be alright, but you can also have permanent damages done on your organs if not death.</p>

        <p>&rt;I have some friends that have shocked me in their fear of this but I get the sneaking suspicion that they maybe so anti-trump that they’re just playing along with the fear because if they come out and say it’s all garbage, they’ll get crucified by their fellow leftist pals.</p>

I don't even care what your political affiliations are, I still enjoy seeing people express a form of pride for their country.</p>
<p>&rt;In general I think the powers that be did a good enough job getting people to comply to avoid being shamed. I don’t think as many people agree as we think but they’re just trying to get by and can’t handle a mob coming for them if they speak up.</p>
<p>That's an astute observation. I didn't consider this in the reverse (a mass push for no mask instead) or as a pervasive necessity. What a mess all this is no matter how one approaches it.</p>

        <p>It really does feel like the twilight zone, because most of us haven't lived through a point of time where mass hysteria has taken over everyday life.  </p>
<p>IMO, most of the human race are slaves and need to be told what to think and feel.  Right now they are being told to be fearful and fear is VERY powerful.   It changes a person, especially when it is addressing one's own mortality.  Most people will give up EVERYTHING in order to feel safe.  That's what we're seeing right now.</p>

        <p>To be fair, light-colored paint and clothes really do make a difference. Could mean the difference between mild/moderate burns and just "POOF!" into your constituent elements. Honestly, I worry more about nuclear war than the rona. Midwestern industrial/agricultural town with low population density + the rona = a few dozen or hundred dead because we don't have a bunch of old people packed like sardines. Midwestern industrial/agricultural town wih low population density + nuclear war = several thousand or tens of thousands dead because our steel/maize production makes us a target.</p>

        <p>Was talking about this with my partner yesterday. But the thing is that I never wanted to know this about humanity. I never wanted to see this in person. I just wanted to assume we’d grown as a species after atrocities like the holocaust. I just want to go back to not knowing.</p>

        <p>100% pandering propaganda.     </p>
<p>In my country, in June, at the worst of the lockdown, millions of jobs on hold/destroyed, scandal after scandal, polls were saying people's perception of their own economical situation were twice as good as 5 months prior. And support for the President was twice as high.    </p>
<p>LMAO.      </p>
<p>Keep lying until it becomes true, make people doubt themselves with overwhelmingly absurd stats, that's what they try.</p>

<p>Belgian here. The government and its people had completely lost their mind. I literally fled to Germany. They’ve still got w mask mandate for shops and public transport but aside from that everything is as close to normal. Heard about that massive protest in Berlin the other day? Yay Deutschland!</p>

        <p>Also remember the type of people that do polls. They’re media lapping up dum dums who look at mainstream media only (which looks scary!) and interact with woke folk on social media. Problem is media reports what the woke folk reckon on twitter but that’s a tiny minority of people. What I like doing is scrolling through comments of news articles that aren’t left bent publication to see what all the norms think who are just as outraged as us. They just don’t tweet they’re opinions though so they’re easy to ignore</p>

        <p>My eldest daughter.  Smart, raised from childhood to examine issues closely and be skeptical of propaganda. We'd have rousing discussions at the dinner table some nights about each new media-promoted "threat".  The balance between skepticism, cynicism, and credulity. She was a teen during the Iraq War protests, came with us to march.  She liked Ron Paul's anti-war stance but was able to clearly articulate where she differed from his other political positions.  She loves science and really understands the scientific method.</p>
<p>Well, shit.  She's a masker now.  She's terrified of getting the DISEASE.  When she comes to visit us she won't take off her mask, won't hug me or her mom or her siblings.  Keeps her distance.  My wife cried after her last visit. "Is this our future? Never hugging or seeing each other's faces ever again? I couldn't stand it!"  I felt the same way, but it really broke my heart to see the tears rolling down her face. I try to cheer her up, to tell her that this too shall pass, but it's hard.</p>
<p>We've had phone conversations where we get into some limited polite discussions, but she can't accept that my dissenting arguments have any validity. Now we just talk about other things.  We love each other and don't want this to drive a wedge between us.</p>

        <p>You did all you could, you seem like a sensible guy and you tried your best to pass that along to your kids. The propaganda is terrible and it's awful how it's brainwashing otherwise reasonable people. Those conspiracies about aliens coming and taking over our loved ones don't seem to stupid anymore - your daughter, my parents - what's happened to the people we've known for all these years? I think I'm a bit younger than your daughter, based on the events you mentioned. My dad always told me not to blindly believe what people tell me and that most of the rules the government makes can be ignored with no consequences. Now he is completely baffled as to why I'm upset. "You don't like being locked down? Why not, what do you want to do?" </p>

        <p>I think it depends on where you’re from. I can honestly say that every single person expect 1 are firmly for masks and lockdowns and still think it’ll kill healthy people like them. All of my friends are extremely far left, and even though this subreddit has shown people across the political aisle hate the “new normal”, you have to admit the fact that a majority of leftists are for these authoritarian measures and listen to whatever the government says without thinking. So yes, for me I feel extremely unique, as I’m deathly afraid of even suggesting that something is wrong without being hated by people I know.</p>

        <p>It feels like if 'The Twilight Zone' had an episode of 'The Twilight Zone.' All the most extreme words have been used so I don't even know what to say to get it across. Each day when I read about the reactions, my gut churns, and something in my soul desiccates.</p>
<p>The lack of context, perspective, the reliance on news media, the fear, the panic. The willingness to reflexively commit to long term destruction of every part of human life creating generations of extreme trauma in forming a new world almost unworthy of living in. The past is laughing at us, the future will laugh at us. I'm trying to make it into a coherent story so I can laugh now.</p>
<p>This insanity feels like being 'The Obsolete Man' that no matter how I try to get the point across, people tacitly allow this happen in the ignorant hope they can get their vapid consumerist lives back.</p>
<p>I'm honestly trying to find new meaning in life now Western society has fully revealed that its cultural systems offer no life. Meaning cannot be found in a screen, and it doesn't seem like a lot of people want meaning, just meagre existence. I wish I could get through to people that we're acting no better, or more intelligently, than medieval serfs at the behest of inquisition.</p>

        <p>Take those polls with a grain of salt. The majority of COVID related polls seem to be manufacturing consent-aka fishing for answers they want. The last poll with the 80% didn't even have a middle ground option or an "I don't know".  But yes, I agree. This feels surreal and not in a good way. At least though we'll have bragging rights when this is all over. We can come out of this with a strong voice against tyranny and people will look up to us for being brave when everyone went crazy. Know anyone who still supports the Iraq war or Patriot act?</p>

        <p>Perhaps the story of the sleeping giant is an analogy for us. We collectively are seeing more and more tricks unfold. I noticed something wasn't right about 4 years ago, and others have been at it even longer. Everything that you see happening isn't a coincidence in 2020 especially.

        <p>I often feel bad when I spend time on facebook or certain parts of reddit but then I go to a busy running trail and almost no one is wearing a mask. I play soccer in a paid league that just started up again and no one seems to really care about masks they just follow the rules because they don't want trouble. In my state the legislature has voted to impeach the governor and end the shutdown but the only reason it continues is because of executive orders and his administration's public health officials. I belong to an anti-shutdown facebook group that has over 100K members.</p>

        <p>A few people I know are privately against lockdowns and masks but turn around and put the mask on blindly and talk about "how bad the pandemic is". A lot of it is saving face, not wanting to be labeled as a pariah.</p>
<p>I never worried about that and I've been open with my anti-lockdown and anti-mask views since day one. I don't wear a mask to the store and I don't pay attention to stares. I don't think I know anyone as defiant as I am.</p>

I’ve not met anyone downright terrified of the virus ( outside of the a few old people) but no one seems to question it all and just follow it.</p>
