    <strong>Vaccine shedding?</strong>
    <p><p>Not sure if there’s a better sub to post this in, but I’m looking for theorizing and anecdotes about your experience with the Covid vax “shedding”, which means that whatever a vaccinated person has been injected with is being passed on to people around them via droplets, like a usual virus or bacteria. Most of us have seem the thousands of reports of women whose menstrual cycles go out of whack after being around vaccinated people, then some of women who’ve had sudden miscarriages, entered early menopause, have unexplained heavy vaginal bleeding for weeks, etc. </p>
<p>I’ve had 2 women close to me experience those things, one of them is in regular close proximity to her vaccinated disabled daughter (who has had half her body paralyzed since taking the vax and it has not improved). She is my kids’ grandmother and about 3 days ago she came over and stayed for a while, today one of my kids woke up with a runny nose, and she’s been sick about 3 times in her life before, so it’s very unusual. She’s definitely the last person she’s been in close proximity to outside of the household. So I’m wondering if this thing can pass from vaccinated people, to people in close proximity, and then from those people to whoever they have close contact with, and so on. What’s also interesting is whether it can manifest in different ways depending on age, sex etc? Obviously my kid won’t have menstrual cycle problems but do most people experience respiratory symptoms along with the more serious effects of exposure? Is it just a virus too, or is it something more unnatural?</p></p>
