    <strong>Attempting to Make Sense of the Science With Sources Included (MATH WARNING)</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all, before you dive deeper, thanks for checking out my post. I've never actually sat down and compared the numbers between these other viral pandemics (1918 Flu, 2009 H1N1, and COVID-19) that affected the U.S, so I figured I'd have a go at comparing some numbers to try and make some sense of this whole thing. I've hyperlinked all of my sources for you fact-checkers, and I am willing to discuss where some of you may believe me to be misunderstood about these numbers. This also turns into a semi-rant at the end, so take what you will. Thanks.</p>

<p>165,081,416 (50%) of the U.S population have been fully vaccinated</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Making Sense of the COVID-19 Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so we have our numbers all right here in front of us. The first one that stands out to me is the confirmed cases number. \~<strong>35.5M cases confirmed</strong> out of a <strong>total population of \~331.5M</strong> resulting in a <strong>10.7% infection rate</strong>. Any rational person would assume that a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/about-covid-19/basics-covid-19.html#:~:text=It%20is%20very%20contagious%20and%20has%20quickly%20spread%20around%20the%20world">very contagious virus that quickly spread around the world</a> would have an infection rate in the U.S higher than 10.7%.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Taking a Look at the 2009 H1N1 Flu Statistics</strong></p>
<p>Estimated U.S Population in 2009 = <a href="https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2008/12/31/us-population-2009-305-million-and-counting">305.5 million</a></p>
<p>Estimated Infection Rate in the U.S = <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html">19.9% (60.8 million)</a></p>
<p>Estimated Death Toll = <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html">12,469</a></p>
<p>Estimated Death Rate for Infected = 12,469 / 60,800,000 = <strong>0.02%</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Taking a Look at the 1918 H1N1 Flu Statistics</strong></p>
<p>I'm just throwing in these 1918 H1N1 Flu statistics for when we compare transmission rates and death rates later...</p>
<p>Estimated U.S Population in 1918 = <a href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm">103 million</a></p>
<p>Estimated Infection Rate in the U.S = <a href="https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/influenza-epidemic/">25% (25.75 million)</a></p>
<p>Estimated Death Toll = <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html">675 thousand</a></p>
<p>Estimated Death Rate for Infected = 675,000 / 25,750,000 = <strong>2.62%</strong></p>
<p>It should also be important to note that vaccines did not exist back then. <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/with-no-vaccine-1918-flu-pandemic-took-deadly-toll-before-widespread-immunity-could-be-achieved/ar-BB190WAg">The virus simply seemed to die out</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Comparing the Infection Rates and Death Rates for Other Viral Infections in the U.S</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-u-s-map-where-virus-has-been-confirmed-across-n1124546">COVID-19</a> 10.7% infection rate 1.74% death rate for those infected</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html">2009 H1N1 Flu</a> 19.9% infection rate 0.02% death rate for those infected</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aier.org/article/are-covid-fatalities-comparable-with-the-1918-spanish-flu/">1918 H1N1 Flu</a> 25% infection rate 2.62% death rate for those infected</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Focusing Further on the Infection Rates between 2009 H1N1 and COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>As simple math suggests, the 2009 H1N1 virus was nearly twice as infectious as the current COVID-19 virus, 19.9% of the U.S population getting infected with 2009 H1N1, and only 10.7% of the U.S population confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. The only argument I can see toward this is the talk about asymptomatic spread of COVID-19, which <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article">this study</a> shows that <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article#:~:text=little%20to%20no%20transmission%20occurred%20from%20asymptomatic%20case-patients">little to no transmission occurred from asymptomatic case-patients</a> and <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article#:~:text=Presymptomatic%20transmission%20was%20more%20frequent%20than%20symptomatic%20transmission">pre-symptomatic transmission was more frequent than symptomatic transmission</a>, meaning that the <strong>asymptomatic spread was really just pre-symptomatic</strong>, and those people would go onto develop further symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Yes, I will state the obvious. COVID-19 is roughly <strong>87 TIMES DEADLIER</strong> than the H1N1 Flu. Now, before the mainstream-media-styled panic sets in, <strong>DO NOT FEAR</strong>, those numbers translate to just <strong>2 infected people out of 10,000 for H1N1</strong> and <strong>174 infected people out of 10,000 for COVID-19</strong> (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/">not to mention that 92.5% of COVID-19 deaths were people aged 50 and older</a>).</p>
<p>Maybe this will make you feel better. Back in 2009, you were <strong>2 TIMES MORE LIKELY</strong> to contract the H1N1 virus than you are of contracting COVID-19 today. This is my personal reason as to why I am not worried about catching the virus. I wasn't fearful back in 2009, so naturally I should be half as fearful today.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Comparing the Timelines Between 2009 H1N1 and COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>H1N1</strong></p>
<p>The first novel 2009 H1N1 flu infections were reported by CDC to the World Health Organization (WHO) through the U.S. International Health Regulations Program on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-pandemic-timeline.html#:~:text=First%20novel%202009%20H1N1%20flu%20infections%20were%20reported%20by%20CDC%20to%20the%20World%20Health%20Organization%20(WHO)%20through%20the%20U.S.%20International%20Health%20Regulations%20Program">April 18, 2009</a>. The first vaccines for this were developed and testing started on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-pandemic-timeline.html#:~:text=Clinical%20trials%20testing%20the%202009%20H1N1%20flu%20vaccine%20began">July 22, 2009 and gained FDA approval just two months later on September 15, 2009</a>. There was then a second wave of outbreaks in late <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-pandemic-timeline.html#:~:text=Second%20wave%20of%20H1N1%20flu%20activity%20peaked%20in%20the%20U.S">October 2009, and the FDA approved a fifth vaccine to combat this on November 16, 2009</a>. After proper testing and research had been done, the vaccine was available to <strong>anyone</strong> <strong>who wanted it</strong> in late <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-pandemic-timeline.html#:~:text=2009%20H1N1%20vaccination%20had%20been%20opened%20up%20to%20anyone%20who%20wanted%20it">December 2009</a>. There was no pressure to get vaccinated, just words of encouragement by <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/presidential-proclamation-national-influenza-vaccination-week">Barack Obama to observe January 10-16 as National Influenza Vaccination Week (NIVW)</a>. The US government had bought 229 million doses of H1N1 vaccines of which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic_vaccine#:~:text=The%20US%20government%20had%20bought%20229%20million%20doses%20of%20H1N1%20vaccines%20of%20which%2091%20million%20doses%20were%20used">91 million doses were used (30% of the U.S population)</a>. There were no threats of job security for unvaccinated people, no vaccine passports, no temperature checks, no mask mandates, and the <strong>virus twice as infectious as COVID-19</strong> quickly lost traction in the U.S and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-pandemic-timeline.html#:~:text=WHO%20announced%20the%20end%20of%202009%20H1N1%20influenza%20pandemic">pandemic was officially ended on August 11, 2010</a>, just 16 months after cases were first announced and spread throughout the world. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>My Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>The main point I'm trying to make here is that we are just all over the place here in the U.S. 50% of the U.S population is fully vaccinated, and cases <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">continue</a> to rise. Something doesn't add up. The numbers <strong>staring me in the face</strong> cause me to believe that there is a sinister reasoning behind this whole pandemic, and it's not a virus. The math simply doesn't add up. Why are we being brainwashed into being fearful of a virus that is <strong>half</strong> as contagious as the 2009 H1N1 virus, and <strong>33%</strong> <strong>less</strong> deadly than the 1918 flu (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/">with 92.5% of those deaths being people aged 50+</a>)? Why are we being pressured to take a vaccine that has YET to be FDA approved, and <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/health-med-fit/virus-levels-high-in-wisconsin-covid-19-cases-even-among-fully-vaccinated/article_b5e35539-43c7-54ed-b31b-dd4bcda8c6eb.html">doesn't stop people from getting sick</a>? It just doesn't make sense to me at all. Maybe I'm a sociopath, maybe I lack empathy, or maybe these numbers are so fucking ridiculous that we shouldn't be allowing the government and media to brainwash us into tyranny. The young and healthy people are actively being locked down and controlled by the older generations who are still gripping onto that last bit of power they have over us before they leave this world. It's just not right. We are throwing away our precious youth for these people who are already knocking on death's door. By the time this shit show is over, we'll be well past our golden youth, and most likely permanently altered from the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/impact-of-covid-19-lockdown-on-teens-mental-health">poor mental health</a> side effects of this new normal. I'm in my mid 20s, and I really feel like our generation is the last one who can really push back against the authoritarian regime before the generations that follow us know nothing of what used to be the free world. They say it takes just a match to start a forest fire, but it feels as if we're all out of matches...</p></p>

        <p>The underlying problem is that the test itself is complete garbage, which means that the results are garbage, and that statistical analysis of "cases" is pointless --- analysing garbage only produces more garbage.</p>
<p>We simply do not know how many (if any) of these "COVID deaths" actually died FROM a new virus called SARS-CoV-2.  We know that governments have been DELIBERATELY reclassifying other deaths as "COVID deaths".  We know that there has been massive and widespread fraud.</p>
<p>If one is going to try to analyse this statistically, then one has to find an uncontaminated data set.  For example, all-cause mortality.  (Since one can always deny the true cause of an individual's death, but it is much harder to deny that they are actually dead.)  Professor Denis Rancourt has been working on this, and his conclusions are pretty damning.</p>
