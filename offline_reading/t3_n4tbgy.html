        <p>It's experimental. Noone knows what will be the long term effects. Also it's unnecessary.</p>

        <p>My concern is probably unfounded, but I will share anyways. </p>
<p>I had MRSA back in 2009, I caught it in the hospital giving birth to my daughter. 
Then, for the following 12-18 months I was put on a variety of different meds. Some of the antibiotics (like doxycycline) gave me really bad mood disturbances. </p>
<p>I had no idea that antibiotics could even do that. Upon research and speaking with my docs, apparently certain meds can absolutely have psychological side effects. </p>
<p>Then, after reading some anecdotal posts here on reddit and on Facebook, I have noticed a lot of people complaining about just that. Things like extreme depression, malaise, suicidal tendencies, etc. </p>
<p>Is it truly a side effect? Is it a placebo? Just trauma presenting after a year of this nonsense? Idk. But is it a risk I am willing to take? Idk. </p>
<p>I am going to be 40 this year. I am otherwise healthy, normal weight, happy, extremely active, teach aerial acrobatics and fitness, contributing member of society, etc. —It scares me to think of side effects. </p>
<p>Another thing I worry about, at least a little bit, is that I suffer from issues with my legs. I had varicose vein surgery earlier this year, but still suffer from extreme pain, swelling, and other leg related discomfort. I was recently in the hospital for suspected DVT. (I was ok after all. Going for a follow up later this month.) —This is pretty much my only health “issue”, but something of potential concern nonetheless. </p>
<p>Also, it kinda creeps me out how hard they are pushing this vaccine. Bribery, threats, no promise of normalcy either way. It’s simply creepy. </p>
<p>So all in all, I am not 100% opposed...and I want to travel. I am going to Costa Rica &amp; Nicaragua on May 31, but you still have to have a negative covid test, weather or not you are vaccinated. </p>
<p>The messaging surrounding the entire pandemic is inauthentic at best and shady af at worst. </p>
<p>Covid needs a new PR person. </p>
<p>Anywho, that’s my take. Sorry for writing a novel lol</p>
