    <strong>Please do not join in cornering obese people - it is part of the plan</strong>
    <p><p>I often see posts here saying we as NNN not wanting the vaccine are slim, fit and healthy whereas people taking the vaccine are fat and unhealthy. Please be careful with these kind of statements. Dividing the people in us versus them is all part of the plan. </p>
<p>As an obese person I looked into it. Most people that died or got hospitalized from Covid have several conditions - 2 to 3 minimum - and often are older people.  </p>
<p>I am obese and am for freedom of choice for everyone. I am not taking the vaccine. </p>
<p>I know it is better to have a healthy weight  and am working on it. 
But other than that I am healthy, I  have no other conditions, I do not smoke, I hardly ever drink alcohol, I hardly ever eat meat or fast food, I exercise daily (although frankly I could do more), I eat lots of fruit and vegetables and often buy ecological food.
Other than may be a one or two days cold every now and then I am never ill.
I know quite a few slim people that have a more unhealthy lifestyle or are more often ill.</p>
<p>Starting now with vaccine passports and a segregation of people into vaccinated and unvaccinated (for some considered healthy versus unhealthy) I believe this is just a beginning of more and more control and segregation. </p>
<p>Now the voices are already talking about: no (free) health care for unvaccinated people. 
In the future they may add all kind of other information in this Covid passport 'health app'. 
Like weight, like smoker - non-smoker, drinker-non-drinker etc etc 
Who doesn't have at least one unhealthy habit? </p>
<p>I think the most dangerous thing that is happening now is the segregation of people. 
I can understand people choose to get vaccinated, especially with the pressure going on. 
But I do fear for people accepting passports, accepting sharing private information, accepting (or even cheering on) segregation. 
If we accept this, what is the next thing to accept? 
With all pointing fingers towards obese people (without mentioning they are at risk especially in combination with diseases such as diabetes or high blood pressure) I feel that is may be the next thing they will focus on. </p>
<p>This is a group of aware people. Please do not go along in any of these efforts to divide us. 
Even the people going along in this all they are just naive, they are not the enemy. </p>
<p>My personal view is emotional health is the main component in being healthy in general. Non of this all is helpful for that. 
Lockdowns, social distancing and setting people up against each other are serious threats to emotional health and wellbeing and this will take its toll on health in general - now or in the future.</p></p>

        <p>Agree with you there. We are all fighting each other. I was wondering if the vaccines won't really do anything, but they are just here to divide us further. I've noticed a big us vs them since 2016 elections. Democrat vs conservative. Now vaxer vs unvaccinated. It's scary. Because when it all comes down to it, we are all the same. I have just decided to focus on my own mental health and improving myself while still being kind to the people who support lockdowns and passports. If they don't want anything to do with me, I won't have anything to do with them. Take care</p>

        <p>Thank you. Yes I also focus mainly on myself and accept others views and decisions and many in my surroundings fortunately accept mine. But I do see a lot of this polarisation going on, often encouraged by the media. 
Take care aswell!</p>

        <p>Nothing against you whatsoever </p>
<p>It’s that people who are obese are obviously at high risk for illnesses</p>
<p>People are frustrated with the portrayal of the obese as “otherwise healthy” who got covid and died of that cause only</p>
<p>Anyway go try intermittent fasting</p>
<p>You can change your life quite quickly </p>

        <p>"other than that I am healthy". I mean this with the utmost of compassion, but you can't be obese and healthy. Period. Do keto or intermittent fasting. It's basically impossible to do keto / carnivore and IF and not lose weight unless you "cheat". 80% of people in hospitals are obese. <strong>We need people like you, so you need to get healthy so that you can fight with us. </strong></p>

        <p>I don’t think people here were turning onto obese, at least I didn’t see it.
It was usually observation that much cheered deaths of unvaccinated happens in larger people, and it’s know correlation.
It’s also a bit hypocritical to say you care about your health and simply be obese (not about you, just general).
That’s what I see being pointed out.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure how its hypocritical to care about your health and be overweight. There are genetic factors associated with being overweight, as well as viral infections that can increase people's weight. Additionally, sometimes people develop endocrine conditions or take medication that increases their body mass. I have a husband who cares very much about his health and does all the right things, and will always be overweight, no matter how much he exercises, eats unprocessed, portion controlled meals, and takes his thyroid medication.</p>
<p>Not trying to nitpick, just pointing out I know a lot of people who are overweight/obese and very obsessed with becoming thin, and very aware of how they are perceived. </p>
<p>Agree with op that targeting obese people isn't helpful. We are all our own worst critics. There are many posts on here denigrating overweight people, which seems to detract from the message and point of the sub.</p>

        <p>Thank you. That is right, everyone is different and overweight people mostly dont choose to be like that. 
In any case, being overweight or not, being healthy or not, I think all of us should strive for freedom of choice for everyone and health care for everyone that needs it, without the government or big tech tracking down on our behaviours, let alone be in control of them.</p>

        <p>People here are missing the point. May be in the states or wherever you are from it is different. So far in the Netherlands everyone has had the right to health care. No questions asked. 
If you got into an accident after drinking, you get hospital care. 
If you are an alcoholic and got liver problems you get care. 
If you are a chain smoker and develop lung cancer you get care. </p>
<p>People should wake up to the fact that something is changing. 
We now need to show 'health ID's'. That never happened before. I have travelled a lot and had a vaccination passport, but was never asked to show it anywhere. </p>
<p>I find it frightening that things are changing this fast. And I feel it is just the beginning. </p>
<p>The answer should not be: check other health issues (like weight), the answer should be: no we dont want any of this control stuff happening. 
Vaxxed or non vaxxed, slim or fat, healthy or unhealthy
We should stand together in this. </p>
<p>BTW my findings as a therapist are all physical problems have a psychological component. So someone with heart problems that has a workaholic mentality or someone that stresses a lot and develops a thyroid problem or someone that just never pays attention to emotional wellbeing, never rests and catches Covid or pneunomia may just be 'as guilty'   as someone with bad eating/ drinking/ smoking habits. 
Where is the limit?</p>

        <p>I think (or hope) this is the silent point people claiming alcoholics should be denied service make.
We either agree that everyone gets a heathcare regardless of their decisions or not.</p>

        <p>I agree. I think we should have health care for everyone and make healthy living easy  for everyone and certainly not force any medical treatment upon anyone.</p>

        <p>I don't think being vegetarian or almost vegetarian is nearly as healthy as people seem to think.  That said, there's a right way and a wrong way, or a better way and a worse way, to do any diet.</p>

        <p>Totally agree, OP. There are quite a few posts on here trying to use obese people as an example, and it just makes them sound like bullies. Unfortunately, even when people are united on one front, they will be divided in others--not all people here are nice people, or even good people, we just have a common enemy. </p>
<p>Keep taking care of you and try not to let the hateful shit get you down.</p>

I am sure not everyone means badly but it is good if people are aware they are working along with the agenda of creating camps.</p>
