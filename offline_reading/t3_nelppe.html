    <strong>This whole segregation of vaccinated and unvaccinated people is so stupid</strong>
    <p><p>If I am right in assuming correctly that if someone is unvaccinated they don't care about getting Covid or they had Covid, but were able to recover from it. So if unvaccinated people don't care or are considered healthy from severe Covid symptoms and those who are vulnerable or scared are the ones being vaccinated then why does it matter who is or isn't vaccinated? The vaccinated people are "protected" or "feel comfortable" to return to normal. The unvaccinated just want to live their lives and I am sure the only reasons if people do wear masks nowadays is to 1. avoid confrontation with a store employee and or manager 2. They don't want to "come off as a republication" for not wearing one. Other than that if there is now an option for people to choose to take the vaccine or not why on earth is there such segregation between vaccinated and unvaccinated people? That's like saying you won't drive even if you get your license and wear a seatbelt because of that chance you might die in a car accident. Or there is that chance you could go out there and cause an accident to someone else.   </p>
<p>If you are too afraid to be with society because of Covid get the shot so you can "feel better". If you aren't too afraid of Covid then let people live their damn lives. Why be so concerned with someone else's decision on what they do with their medical choices? IF YOU'RE STILL THAT SCARED OF COVID STAY HOME! DO TAKEOUT! DO CURBSIDE! HOLD A VACCINATED ONLY PARTY IF THAT FLOATS YOUR BOAT. I DARE SOMEONE ELSE TO TELL ME THEY ARE VACCINATED AND IF THEY DO I'LL EITHER SAY "I AM TOO BUT YOU DON'T SEE ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT" OR "COOL". Lmao it's so sad really people should be able to live their lives and make choices that are good for themselves instead of being pressured by the general public on what they can and cannot do.</p></p>

        <p>I think a reason for a lot of "hesitancy" is the fact of how public it is about sharing their medical history to some random store or venue employee JUST TO GET ACCESS TO GET IN. Like people aren't comfortable going out there and sharing their medical history. I mean there are some but you know those are some crazy democrats.</p>

        <p>I’m getting the vaccination (unpopular take on this sub, I understand) but once I get it and the two weeks pass, I’m going to be very aggressive about not wearing a mask. If I’m getting the damn vaccination, it better actually be worth something in my life.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter if you are vaccinated or unvaccinated on this sub. From my understanding if you don't feel like you are anymore special or should get special privileges for being vaccinated. I have actually seen posts from vaccinated people either to share their experience or if they respect our decision not to then that's all what matters and they don't get downvoted simply because they showed respect.</p>

        <p>The "logic" you'll usually hear from those in favor a vaccine passports is that there are people who want the vaccine but can't get it because of some medical reason.  While that may be true, we're talking about a miniscule percentage of the population, and with so many people now vaccinated and many more having natural immunity, the odds of any such person getting covid, much less a bad enough case to hospitalize or kill them, are so insanely low that it is indeed absurd to segregate people on their behalf.</p>
<p>In order for such a person to be infected by you, first you'd have to have covid asymptomatically (extremely low chance, statiscally speaking), then you'd have to encounter such a person in your daily life (extremely low chance), and then you'd have to breathe enough particles near them to infect them (extremely low chance since you're asymptomatic).  Add it up and the odds are so slim it's stupid to even think about.  And then even if somehow all of those conditions are met and you do pass covid to this person, the odds of them becoming seriously ill are also slim as fuck.  They have a much better chance of dying from many other things that no one gives a fuck about.</p>

        <p>that's the tragedy of all the people who are dying from the vaccine... they thought they were doing something in their best interests.  they thought it would be safe and helpful.  and they are dead and none of the rest even want to know they exist.</p>
