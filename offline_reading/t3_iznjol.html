    <strong>FINALLY.......</strong>
    <p><p>First of all some of you will be offended due to your perspective on teaching online. Those of you who teach or understand that WE HATE teaching online (it isn’t easy). We are finally opening back up on Monday. I visited my classroom and just release that first breath of intake. It was awesome. I’m excited for Monday. There are covid rules....but I’m more than happy to follow if it allows me to be in person and face to face. My district is like a chicken running with it head off, but I got my class and prepare to follow whatever just as long as we remain open. </p>
<p>Stay positive. Slowly but surely we will get back to normal. Stay strong.</p></p>

        <p>The teachers who are the most vocal about their position of fear and hysteria are the ones being heard. I realize there are union issues but teachers in support of in person learning need to start yelling back. I’ve been incredibly disappointed* in teachers as of late, because all I see and hear are the ones celebrating laying in bed all day while “teaching” and acting like everyone will die if schools open.</p>

        <p>I guess I need to visit these areas. I haven’t seen or heard (among my teaching group) anything but how much we hate it. One thing we hate is the inconsistency of the district and new rules apply each day. Working at home is a lot more because we post then emails come in throughout the day. It like working 3 jobs almost staying at home.</p>

        <p>The people who hate it... were they speaking up about the need to go in person?</p>
<p>What I’m hearing is that they hate online teaching AND don’t want to go back to in person because then they’d have to write their wills. </p>
<p>So teachers can bemoan online teaching, that doesn’t mean they are speaking up about students’ right to receive a real in person education.</p>

        <p>The teachers who hate it were probably busy replying to emails creating lesson plans 2 weeks in advance. </p>
<p>I’m teaching high school but I feel bad for elementary because the rules are extreme compare to middle and high school. It frustrating to see people on here and other social media think it easier when it isn't. (sorry I'm mobile and I'm ranting</p>

<p>We are confused and hurt but teachers and teachers unions lobbying to make this a reality .</p>
<p>And they lobbied HARD, uniformity, across the country.</p>
<p>Maybe your anger is misplaced? These teachers and unions want to be heard. And by golly they are getting heard.</p>
<p>Are you mad at us for listening?</p>

        <p>There's a self righteous teacher I know who literally posted a selfie of her crying over 3 teachers who died in our state. I'm excited to see what she'll post when she's forced to teach in person. She also shared her living will on FB this summer. She's a drama teacher...</p>

        <p>Yeah screw them. I’m definitely curious what grade and school. My district and a few others are hating this crap. We are starting off hybrid and to record yourself on zoom and teach in person. Here a riddle. How do you give a paper assignment and not expect to touch the paper again? That one rule. Hand outs aren’t supposed to be shared lol</p>

        <p>That’s great news! All of the public and private schools in the 3 counties in my area have been open for in person classes since at least the middle of August (most opened up around the 7th). I don’t have kids, and the couple of teachers that I do know haven’t talked much about it since the first day of school. But from what I gather, the situation right now is that they have to wear face masks (they get 15 minute mask free breaks throughout the day, which defeats the entire purpose), and spaced out desks with plastic dividers around most of them. But they’ve been having football games, and having people in the stands. A couple of schools “quarantined” a few hundred students for being in contact with a kid that was tested positive, but of course no follow up articles on anything. One of the teachers at a high school here passed away from it, back at the end of August, but he was older, very overweight, and had health problems already. Lately, I haven’t heard anything else about the schools.</p>
<p>The only school system in the area that hasn’t opened is in Moss Point, but I think that they open up next month. The mayor there is extremely corrupt (bullying older city employees so that they’ll quit their jobs and so he can put his friends in those positions, stealing taxpayers money to buy his wife and multiple mistresses expensive gifts and go on vacations, and fucking his mistresses in the firefighters’ bunks at the local fire stations. And then when he gets caught, he pushes the fire chief to retire, and is currently being criminally investigated, along with his wife). He’s desperately trying to gain a re-election, because most people here absolutely hate him. So he’s been super draconian on the lockdowns and safety theater mandates.</p>
