    <strong>How many businesses do you think will make &amp; enforce a no mask rule in the coming months?</strong>
    <p><p>Think about it, if a company can make and enforce a mask rule, what’s stopping them from making a no mask rule?</p></p>

        <p>i've already seen posts of signs on businesses saying they don't want the vaccinated to enter. it will probably be a bit of a culture war for a little while until they both get bored of reducing their business by half.</p>

        <p>I welcome anyone in my business, mask or no mask, who wants to spend money with us. I don't have the luxury to turn business away.</p>

        <p>In the beginning, it’ll be a mixed bag. In the end, nearly all will, along with the vaccine passports.</p>
<p>Obviously, nobody knows for sure what measures would be in place. But here’s my (somewhat educated?) guess.</p>
<p>There wouldn’t be any guards or anything like that. Everything would look normal-ish, except perhaps, at the beginning, someone standing at the door to scan your QR code.</p>
<p>A lot of small, NNN-sympathizing businesses would quietly defy the rule at first, but this number would rapidly shrink as many businesses get reported and the owners and employees dealt with severely, thus scaring off most of the rest from continuing in their disobedience.</p>
<p>The majority of businesses from that point on would, at first, scan the QR code at the door and at checkout. Eventually, it would be understood that you couldn’t buy anything without a code, and if you didn’t have one and even went inside without buying anything, and someone found out, you’d be reported and dealt with. At that point, the code would only be scanned at checkout, likely tied to some cashless form of payment.</p>
<p>Failure to present a valid code would result in your being reported; even most of those businesses owners that resisted at first will fear what would happen to them and their family too much to turn a blind eye and not report on anyone who came in or tried to buy something without a code.</p>
<p>There will, for at least a while, be a small number of businesses that come up with clever ways to get around the system—maybe they’d have the unvaccinated shop at different times, maybe we’d use the barter system, etc. This won’t last forever, though—in the near future, we won’t have any privacy, and won’t be very difficult for people to find out about and report these businesses, and probably a lot of their black market customers (us). This will eventually reduce the black market shops either to a very small number of businesses with very seedy ties and questionable sources, or (perhaps and?) to a small number of somewhat covertly controlled-opposition shops that occasionally sell poisoned/rotted supplies and the such in an effort to weed out the remaining dissidents.</p>

        <p>As soon as their policy (either way) hits their bottom line. Then it will change.</p>

        <p>Depends on the state and the state regulations. Depends in the shop owner and the shop owners awareness. Depends on the costumers and the costumers ignorance.</p>
