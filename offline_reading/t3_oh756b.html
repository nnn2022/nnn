    <strong>I need a break from it all</strong>
    <p><p>I don't mean to get too personal, but I feel like this is one of the only places, online or IRL, where I feel like I can talk about this stuff without being too harshly judged. I realize this is not my diary but I would assume there are people out there that share my struggles.</p>
<p>I found out a few months ago that my school was requiring the vaccine in order to continue my degree program, that my prospective career would undoubtedly require it, and that half of my family has barred me and a few others from seeing them because we won't take the vaccine. </p>
<p>I made this reddit account because I feel like I had no one left in my life to air out my frustrations and nobody like-minded to talk about this stuff with. I will say that this sub is a gem, and there are some wonderful and intelligent humans that are floating around here, despite what the world says about us.</p>
<p>About a month ago I made a post about unplugging from social media, and how the doom and gloom has destroyed my happiness and motivation, so I set out to take a break from it all. I vowed to put the internet down and take solace in the little things in my life that give me happiness; things that make me feel alive.</p>
<p>Well it didn't work out so well. I learned first-hand about the dopamine-fueled dependency on social media and fear porn that rivals the most addictive of drugs. I've been drinking nearly every night, smoking weed every night, I started smoking cigarettes again recently, I haven't been socializing and have been declining invites, and I find myself checking reddit constantly throughout the day, seeing what the latest act is in this circus world, finding new ways to describe how fucked we are as a species, and ultimately reassuring myself that I'm not crazy.</p>
<p>I've struggled with addiction and introversion throughout my entire life leading up to this pandemic, and it's all ramped up to a degree that I've never experienced before. I've always been able to remain functional in my life despite these issues, but now I feel like I have hit a new low. </p>
<p>I realized I'm no better than the doomers we love to complain about. The virtue-signaling robots who self-righteously peddle whatever the media tells them and the people who would happily watch the world burn if it were to save one grandma. These are also people who live their lives with fear guiding their actions, who have let modern industrialized digital society make them lose touch with their human spirit. </p>
<p>I've realized that my grim outlook on the remainder of my life, although not unfounded, is wildly exacerbated by sensationalist headlines, media talking-heads, demoralizing trolls and bots, and my tendency to shut out my physical existence in exchange for my digital existence.</p>
<p>Friends, take it from me, this is no way to live your life.</p>
<p>I realize announcing your departure from social media is often met with groans and eye-rolls, like "cool buddy, see ya" or "haha we'll see you next week". But I'm making this post for the people who feel like their lives have been utterly consumed by all of the bullshit; people who find themselves mentally and physically deteriorating because they can't find the will to live their life anymore. </p>
<p>Life is happening right now. As the minutes, hours, days pass by where you are busy worrying about the future, you are not able to truly appreciate the present moment. The internet is both a cesspool of negativity and an incredible driving force for truth and togetherness, and it is easy for depression and anxiety to set in if you do not use it responsibly. Go outside, say hi to a stranger, try something new even if you suck at it initially, draw a picture, start a garden; be the human you were before this sick society tainted your spirit.</p>
<p>Over the last two months on NNN, I've exchanged words with some really kind people, some really brilliant people, some really hateful people, some mind-bendingly stupid people, and everything in-between. </p>
<p>But as nice as all that has been, I need to get busy living my life. I need to find a reason to get out of bed every morning, a new plan to support myself, and to rid my life of habits that serve me no purpose.</p>
<p>I'm really, actually, for real, no-foolin' gonna try to unplug from screens for a while, because I simply don't recognize myself anymore. There is more to life than fear, no matter how much our public health overlords want you to think otherwise. I want my life back, so I will take it back, one day at a time. Maybe I'll go for a hike or kick a ball around or something; you know, the little things.</p>
<p>And I'll try not to be back next week, lol. Love y'all and thank you for being a force for good in the world.</p></p>

        <p>You're in the middle of a world wide global propaganda campaign designed to turn the masses against people like us who know the government is up to no good.</p>
<p>You're on the right side of history. Don't worry about this vaccine shot and don't feel like you have to justify your decision to pass on it. If people bug you over it you can lie and say you've been vaccinated in the worst case, and in the best case just say that you've done your research and concluded that the covid vaccine isn't worth getting for a virus with an EXTREMELY high survival rate for anyone under 70.</p>

        <p>I would talk to the head of your program and see if there is anyway you can keep going to school without being vaccinated. You may be surprised. Or they may just be an asshole. I hope not though.</p>

        <p>I've been feeling similar to this. I haven't been sleeping well and constantly trying to read anything I can, taking in all sides. I have two young children and feel like I'm not being fully present for them. It's hard to break away because I feel like I would be missing out on "important" break through info that could also end up getting censored or some shit before I could see it. Likely most of everything is out of my hands so why stress? Anyways..
Best wishes</p>

        <p>Yes! Everything nowadays is fear mongering. We truly need to get back to normal. We need to stop living in fear that all of these conspiracies will happen. Could they happen? Sure. Could they also not happen? Also sure. If they do happen, we can focus on that. If not, we need to disconnect for a while and just realize that everything isn’t as bad as it looks. We all need to come back together and not make everything about politics all the time. You want the vaccine? Go for it. You don’t? That’s cool as well. It’s so sad that some people are wrapped up so heavily in all of this stuff. We won’t truly get back to normal until they do. In the meantime, enjoy what we’ve got, because even though there’s a small chance, we likely won’t be losing anything and all of this worry is for nothing. Excellent post.</p>

        <p>I've found what's helped me the most mentally was finding my faith again. The traditional Catholic priests I follow are completely against the new normal and the great reset. (There are also some good traditional Catholic lay person podcasts out there, same thing.)  It also helps change the focus when you're focusing on God. </p>
<p>Also, I started gardening and canning, going for walks, etc. Reading real books.</p>
<p>As to college, there's this hermit priest I follow. Reddit actually put a domain filter on his blog - if I try to share a post in chat with a friend it just crashes the chat. Lol.  Anyway, he recently gave a 9 minute chat about other opportunities, other than college - you may find it interesting: https://youtu.be/aYjE7igRphI</p>
<p>I hope you feel better.</p>

        <p>You are correct about 99% of your post.</p>
<p>The other 1%, which you can never escape, that pulls you back to the reality of our situation, is when I leave the house to say "Hi" to someone,  they look back at me fearfully from behind a Mask - they look at me as a perfectly healthy person as the Bringer of Death and the End of Mankind.</p>
<p>I''m on the opposite side. I'm not much for social media and are aware of it's pitfalls. It's my day to day life and observing it's effects on everyone that causes me concern.</p>
