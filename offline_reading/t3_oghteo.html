<p><em>Frodo: "I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened."</em></p>
<p><em>Gandalf: "So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides that of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you were also meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought.”</em></p>
<p>​
We're all here for a reason. God, Spirit, the universe....whatever you want to call it...there's a force at work in this world that's greater than the petty mechanisms of the bankers and politicians. Whatever that force is, I - like Tolkien - believe that it has a plan, and we're all a part of it.  There's more good than evil in this world.  To borrow again from the Lord of the Rings:</p>
<p><em>Sam: "It's like the great stories, Mr. Frodo, the ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad has happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow, even darkness must pass. A new day will come, and when the sun shines, it'll shine out the clearer. I know now folks in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going because they were holding on to something. That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for."</em></p>

        <p>Needed this.  It's all so tiresome with the "new variants", the people still wearing masks outside, the fear of losing a job for not wanting to take the vaccine, or having things escalate to where those of us who refuse to be vaccinated won't be able to live a normal life.  I've felt so anxious about it today.  So thank you for reminding us all to keep the faith and keep our heads up!</p>

        <p>Just look at how hard the rapists, slavers, and cultural pirates have to work to cover up the truth. They have to have billion dollar campaigns and his armed thugs in a freaking attempt to get you to submit to their tyranny. Go on YouTube and look at all the official COVID-19 and Whitehouse vids now look at the thumbs up/down ratio. We're on the winning my fellow men and women. They have no chance the jig is up.</p>

        <p>Black Pilled:</p>
<p><em>The Black Pill is a metaphorical term often used to describe a set of beliefs often linked to nihilism, fatalism and defeatism. Online, the "black pill" is commonly associated with incels and 4chan users described referred to as "doomers".</em> </p>
