    <strong>Insanity.</strong>
    <p><p>There I was, enjoying reading some comments in my fandom [Outlander]. Then talk turned to the virus and I have no idea why and the vaccine and suddenly I’m being told that basically people that don’t take the vaccine can be compared to people during World War II who didn’t turn their lights off so that the Germans would see the light and bomb you, as they didn’t want to do it because the Government told them to do it. etc. So people that don’t take the vaccine are actually being compared to idiots like that. I’m not sure what the hell this has got to do with a TV show about a Highlander etc but this is what worries me it’s like everything you talk about somehow the virus/vaccine/ etc it just seeps into the conversation doesn’t it. I really want to respond but I’m just so tired of it. I just said if you really think that a bomb that has been manufactured and is designed to cause havoc in combat situations is in any way shape or form like a virus then I don’t really know what to say to you. I wish I could say something more intelligent but I’m just tired of all this you know. Just tired</p></p>

        <p>I hear ya.  I can't believe how easily people can be manipulated into what seems like neverending fear.  I feel like a sane person in an insane world.</p>

        <p>Surprisingly there’s been quite a few people that are kicking back on this so I’m quite pleased with that but still it’s terribly depressing. It’s like can we talk about something else!</p>
