    <strong>Some questions to ask Doomers to stump them</strong>
    <p><p>Thank you for the awards! With that being said, here is 15 top questions to ask a Doomer</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does the mask have to cover my nose to protect from droplets that only come out of my mouth?</li>
<li>If social distancing works, why do we need masks (You can reverse this too)</li>
<li>If you are so worried about getting Coronavirus, why don't you stay home?</li>
<li>Do you do this every flu season?</li>
<li>Some people are asymptomatic. By checking my temp. and letting me in without a mask, you are saying that asymptomatics cannot spread the disease. So how can you still say that asymptomatic people transmit it?</li>
<li>If mandatory masks are constitutional, can you point out where?</li>
<li>Why is it OK to go to Wal-Mart but not to the beach?</li>
<li>If everybody can wear a mask because you can, can everybody dunk a basketball because Michael Jordan can?</li>
<li>More children die of the flu than Coronavirus, so should we reopen schools like this every flu season?</li>
<li>Can you point out where you got this data?</li>
<li>Can you show me how herd immunity doesn't work?</li>
<li>If Fauci said masks don't work in the beginning of this and then changed his mind, why should we believe what he says now?</li>
<li>Can you tell me why hydrocxychloroquineis ineffective?</li>
<li>Why are you telling me to wear a face covering that I can see through?</li>
<li>If this virus is so deadly, why don't we have to wear masks and socially distance from our family members that we live with?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sept. 15.</p>
<p>I have asked over 30 doomers these very questions, to no response from them. These questions work, masks don't!</p></p>

        <p>Ask them about the BLM "protests" or the recent slip-ups by some of our politicians (Nancy Pelosi, Jim Kenny, Steve Sisolak, etc.) Either they will short-circuit and shut down or engage in some serious Olympic-level mental gymnastics.</p>

        <p>Hi, liberal here. The BLM protests I've been at have all been outside, and most people were wearing masks. Transmission outside is very low already, and when most people are wearing masks, it's even lower. That's why the mask regulations address indoor situations. As for Pelosi? That was stupid, and she's a hypocrite for not wearing a mask, setup or no. Awful decisionmaking on her part. Haven't heard about the other two, but people aren't perfect. Their mistakes don't invalidate the general argument, but they don't get a pass for them.</p>

        <p>If masks work and the fact that transmission is low outside, then why do we have to watch outdoor concerts socially distanced? Why did Fauci get the whole stadium on opening day to ourselves while us filthy, unwashed plebs had to watch it on TV?</p>
<p>Those Etsy masks and Chinese surgical masks that the vast majority of people wear must be a lot more effective than I thought.</p>

        <p>We have to remain socially distanced because we're hedging our bets. Just wearing masks is helpful. Wearing masks and keeping distance is better. And we can't have crowds because people don't listen, man. People who show up don't wear masks, or clump together, or otherwise don't respect the regulations. None of this is perfect. No solution is 100%. It's about incrementally decreasing the chances of transmission, and so, working together, continuing to slow and stop the spread. There's no magic bullet. There's just all of us doing a few small things that make a very small difference individually, but when enough people wear masks, and enough people respect social distancing, things have gotten better.</p>
<p>I understand that we're coming at this from fundamentally different places, and I don't want to get into an internet slapfight or something. That's no fun. But sometimes, it's nice to have discussions with people with a different perspective. I know it's helped me expand my understanding and views in the past.</p>

        <p>I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, in fact I'm not even particularly well read on the coronavirus, but these feel like common sense so I'll take a stab at it</p>
<ol>
<li>Why does the mask have to cover my nose to protect from droplets that only come out of my mouth?</li>
</ol>
<p>Stuff comes in and out of your nose, no? I mean when I sneeze it certainly feels like at least some of it is coming out of my nose</p>
<ol>
<li>If social distancing works, why do we need masks (You can reverse this too)</li>
</ol>
<p>Because they both help. If social distancing helps, and masks help, then putting them together helps a little more</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are so worried about getting Coronavirus, why don't you stay home?</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally I'm sick of staying home</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you do this every flu season?</li>
</ol>
<p>No but this flu season has killled almost 5 times as many people as last flu seasons, so maybe we need to take 5 times the precaution</p>
<ol>
<li>Some people are asymptomatic. By checking my temp. and letting me in without a mask, you are saying that asymptomatics cannot spread the disease. So how can you still say that asymptomatic people transmit it?</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no connection between the way viruses operate, and the way minim um wage workers standing in the doorway of Walmart operate. If the virus can be transmitted asymptomatically, then it can be transmitted asymptomatically, regardless of whether someone does or does not take your temperature</p>
<ol>
<li>If mandatory masks are constitutional, can you point out where?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thats actually the reverse of how the constitution works, the constitution lays out what ISNT constitutional, and everything thats not included is. Thats why its legal to, for example, make it mandatory to wear clothes in public. Where in the constitution does it say that mandatory clothes are constitutional?</p>
<ol>
<li>Why is it OK to go to Wal-Mart but not to the beach?</li>
</ol>
<p>So from a risk-avoidance perspective, shopping is more critical than beach going. But personally im not really judging people who go to the beach because i go to the beach</p>
<ol>
<li>If everybody can wear a mask because you can, can everybody dunk a basketball because Michael Jordan can?</li>
</ol>
<p>No but almost everybody can wear a mask because its easy. Its more like holding a basketball than dunking one </p>
<ol>
<li>More children die of the flu than Coronavirus, so should we reopen schools like this every flu season?</li>
</ol>
<p>I dont really have a strong opinion on schools. If my kids were school age I'd probably send them</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you point out where you got this data?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm just using good old fashion common sense for this one</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you show me how herd immunity doesn't work?</li>
</ol>
<p>No clue. I havent formulated an opinion on herd immunity. But there are plentry of writings you can read on both sides of the matter</p>
<ol>
<li>If Fauci said masks don't work in the beginning of this and then changed his mind, why should we believe what he says now?</li>
</ol>
<p>You dont have to believe Fauci, but there are thousands of other very smart people who do say you should wear a mask</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you tell me why hydrocxychloroquineis ineffective?</li>
</ol>
<p>If it was effective I imagine conservative doctors all over the country would be using it to cure their patients and we'd hear all about it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why are you telling me to wear a face covering that I can see through?</li>
</ol>
<p>I cant see through my face covering so maybe you need a different brand</p>
<ol>
<li>If this virus is so deadly, why don't we have to wear masks and socially distance from our family members that we live with?</li>
</ol>
<p>It isnt practical to wear them at home and nobody would do it</p>

        <p>I am a conservative. But I will just elaborate on a couple. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Micro droplets come from your nose. A shit ton of stuff comes out of your nose when you sneeze. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people dont have the option to stay home. They have to go to work or lose their job or home. Also people have to grocery shop. Thats why its ok to go to Walmart and not the beach. Also you can go to the beach if you try to distance where possible. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private businesses can do as they please. No shirt, no shoes, no service has been around for years and no one besides florida man has a problem saying it’s unconstitutional. They just added no mask no service. Also its perfectly legal for your private employer to require masks they have a dress code and could make you wear clown shoes if they wanted. If you dont like it find another job.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont even get this. Comparing mask wearing to dunking a basketball? K. Dunking a basketball isnt going to help anyone. Wearing a mask protects you and the people around you. I dont know why people preach their religion and when it comes time to put their money where their mouth is they refuse to protect their neighbors everyone is up in arms about a piece of cloth. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The studies show kids might not die but they are carriers so they will spread it when they get home. Also studies show kids end up with permanent heart damage. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data is everywhere. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for herd immunity to work almost all of the country would have to get it and that would result in a huge number of deaths to achieve. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine studies have not been good. Not good enough to warrant mass distribution and a lot of the studies have been stopped early because of negative side effects including deaths.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You dont have to wear a mask and distance with the people you share a house with because youre already breathing the same air and sharing a space whatever you have they have and vice versa. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope everyone can begin to look at all sides of things and do some internal soul searching. </p>
<p>Why do i believe this?</p>
<p>If no one can convince me of anything other than what i believe maybe im close minded. What can i do to be more open minded? </p>
<p>Am i looking at this rationally or have i just chosen a team? No matter what that team does im on board and this team can do no wrong. </p>
<p>Have i tied this belief to my identity?</p>
<p>If im religious am i following it to the best of my ability? Or am i giving in to my anger envy and hatred of my neighbors because of their beliefs? </p>
<p>We can all be better people. We have got to work together. We do not have to agree. But we do have to take care of each other. If you wont take the most simple step and wear a mask to help your fellow citizen thats very sad for us as a whole. Youre willing to give another persons life to exercise your selfishness. I thought we loved our neighbors and took care of each other no matter what in times like these. In this great country we need to lend a hand. Were being torn apart from the inside while other countries laugh. If we dont become better were going to end up like these other shithole countries that have  extreme religious and extreme nationalist groups hurting our own. This is a sad timeline i hope we all can do better.</p>

<p>Yes, private businesses can do what they please!  The problem is, the COVID regulations are being forced upon them by the gov't.  Businesses are not being allowed to choose what safety precautions to take.  </p>

<p>I agree that it's stupid to say the average person can't wear a mask indoors to run errands.  The one point I disagree with is the wearing of masks while exercising.  The only people I've seen who can pull this off without overheating or struggling to breathe are people already in marathon-level shape.  Maybe that's where the comparison to the athlete comes in?</p>
<p>7)<br>
&rt;  In order for herd immunity to work almost all of the country would have to get it and that would result in a huge number of deaths to achieve. </p>
<p>The research papers I'm seeing are putting the herd immunity threshold at roughly 20-30% infected population.  That's not the majority of the country.  Sweden may already have achieved herd immunity, and their death toll is not much higher than their neighbors' and will likely be much lower by the time their neighbors reach herd immunity.  (For example, Sweden has 570 deaths/million in population, with no lockdowns and only mild WFH and no mass gatherings.  France locked down for 2 months and has 470 deaths/million, and their cases/deaths continue to climb despite mask mandates.)  Of course this is still developing in investigations, so the jury is still out.</p>

        <p>The difference is sweden has very strict lockdown for the elderly, no gatherings over 50 and embraced work from home. After the inital surge swedes took notice and started to follow the guidelines set into place. </p>
<p>For herd immunity to be achieved, if its possible, would take 20-30% of the population to contract the virus. </p>
<p>66 million - 90 million people in the united states would have to contract the virus. </p>
<p>Right now we have ≈ 6.3 million cases/190,000 deaths</p>
<p>With the current trend of deaths would mean...</p>
<p>@ 20% = 66 million cases/ 3,473,580 deaths</p>
<p>@ 30% = 90 million cases/ 4,736,700 deaths</p>
<p>Thats alot of people lost. A lot of people out of the economy forever. A lot of families disrupted and damaged forever. Kids losing their parents, older parents losing their kids, brothers, sisters, grandparents. If we reach that almost every family in the country will have been touched by this. Its irreparable damage. We have to slow this thing. Sweden is an anomaly i believe. They dont have answers as to why their numbers dropped besides locking down elderly and people conforming to the mask and distancing suggestions. I dont know but there are countries fairing better than sweden also. This will all be clearer a few years out but for right now its depressing. </p>
<p>Thanks for the pleasant conversation and dialogue. Its hard to find on the internet if your opinions differ so much appreciated. Stay safe bro.</p>

        <p>&rt; With the current trend of deaths would mean...
&rt; 
&rt; 
&rt; 
&rt; @ 20% = 66 million cases/ 3,473,580 deaths
&rt; 
&rt; 
&rt; 
&rt; @ 30% = 90 million cases/ 4,736,700 deaths</p>
<p>Something's off with your math.  IFR is 0.6%.  0.6% of 66 million cases is 396,000 deaths.  Not millions.  And even that IFR number is not stratified by age, meaning that it's not guaranteed all 20% of those who got infected would even have a 0.6% chance of dying from it.  And the average age of COVID deaths, by the way, is over the life expectancy of the average person in the US.  Yes, that is still a lot of people lost.  However, to put it into perspective, 300,000 people die every year in the US from obesity-related heart conditions.  The work force isn't suffering from lack of employees.  If anything, we have too many people and too few quality jobs.</p>
<p>And here's the other thing--poverty kills.  It destroys families and disrupts lives.  Right now, we're approaching unprecedented unemployment rates in the US.  Last I heard, it was something like 30-40% unemployed.  Many of those jobs won't come back.  Those numbers frighten me far more than a 0.6% IFR that is heavily skewed toward the elderly.  What I believe we should be doing is targeted mitigation, not blanket mitigation.  Stop paying young healthy people to sit home on their asses and use that money to surround care facilities with testing and proper PPE.  (As it sits 40% of the COVID deaths in the US were in care facilities--when the DOJ investigations get underway we may find that number's even higher.)  Use it to provide hazard pay for medical workers, and to provide lodging for medical workers who live with elderly family members.  Put all working seniors and people who are immuno-compromised on the enhanced unemployment.  And open everything back up for the rest of us.  People need to work to live.  And we cannot keep printing money without also increasing production, or we are headed for an economic disaster that makes 2008 look like Disneyland.</p>

        <p>Theres no way at 6 million cases we have almost 200,000 dead but at 66 million cases we only have 398,000 dead?</p>
<p>Multiply 6 million x 11= (low end 20%) 66 million</p>
<p>If the rate of death we have now continues that would equal 180,000 x 11= 1,980,000</p>
<p>My math was off. Labor day drinks. But mostly im saying sweden can push and be the experiment for herd immunity. Sweden has 10 million people. NYC has 8.5 million people. Were way too big of a country. Were 50 countries tied together. The loss would be astronomical waiting for 20-30% of the gen pop to get it. </p>
<p>I agree the economic devastation is nuts. Economic devastation happens like a slow car crash. The initial impact isnt felt immediately. The loss of jobs and immediate halt of money being injected into the economy is going to reverberate for years to come.</p>

        <p>In all fairness my calculation based on IFR is probably rubbish, since I am not factoring in the many variables epidemiologists use, so technically we're both guilty of "napkin math" here.  I'm not an epidemiologist but I do know the various models are using far more complicated formulas than simple proportion calculations.  The line for viral propagation isn't a trendline; it's a curve, so you can't use simple proportions to extrapolate future deaths.  Based on the death patterns of most countries right now, I highly doubt the US is going to hit the death tolls you're proposing.  The only model predicting that was the IMHE model, which has been proven to be severely flawed.  </p>
<p>&rt; The loss would be astronomical waiting for 20-30% of the gen pop to get it. </p>
<p>But our current mitigations are not providing us with anything to do <em>but</em> wait.  Cases are still rising--quickly, even in highly mask-compliant states like mine.  A vaccine will speed up our arrival at herd immunity greatly, but we cannot continue printing money until 2021 and expect the poverty-related deaths to not eventually outstrip the COVID deaths.</p>

        <p>Are you having trouble with the idea of things not being binary.</p>
<p>No one is saying that it blocks 100%. Even if we all wear masks it wouldn’t guarantee that no one gets sick, it would just further diminish the chances. The best way to stop me breathing in someone’s virus is to limit how much of the virus that person is breathing out. </p>

        <p>Are you having trouble reading my post? (Just poking in fun here). 😀 I believe I said the words "greatly diminish". Never said 100%.</p>
<p>And I fail to see the headlight correlation. My headlights have dual purpose: see and be seen. Masks have only one: barrier. The barrier, partial as you say, should work both ways, in and out.</p>

        <p>So then it make sense that we should all wear masks to further diminish the chances of spreading to get it as close to 0 as possible. Especially since wearing masks are such an easy thing to do. </p>
<p>Mask also have that dual purpose: prevent you from spreading, prevent you from catching. Stopping viral droplets from leaving you mask and stop viral droplets from getting inside your mask. </p>
<p>I don’t tear out my airbags because my brakes greatly diminish chances of me crashing.</p>
<p>We don’t let drivers drive around with no lights on at night even though our own lights greatly diminish the darkness around us.</p>

        <p>A window screen will keep flies from coming in or going out. That does not make it dual purpose. The outcome is the same: stopping the passage of flies regardless of direction. (This is in response to the headlight analogy. Not making any other points about masks here.)</p>

<li>Ever hear of a sneeze?</li>
<li>Neither of them are 100%, but they help reduce risk together.  We need them both.</li>
<li>I can't because I don't live in the socialist paradise of my dreams.  If you'd voted in a socialist instead of Trump we wouldn't be here now.</li>
<li>Did you seriously just compare this to the flu?</li>
<li>I agree, checking temp is useless.  Put your mask on and follow the rules.</li>
<li>Is it constitutional to require clothes in public?  That's where.</li>
<li>Essentials are essentials, and the beach isn't.</li>
<li>There are exceptions. (I'll just secretly hate and ostracize anyone that wants to claim one.)</li>
<li>Did you seriously just compare this to the flu again?</li>
<li>Experts.  Every acceptable media outlet everywhere. (Except the CDC which you can't trust anymore.)</li>
<li>Do you want 2.2 million more people to die in the US?</li>
<li>Because science changes as we learn more, unlike you.</li>
<li>The medical community has discussed moved on from this.  Go read the double blind studies.  You Trumpers just can't let this go, can you?</li>
<li>You can breathe through it too.  Masks work.  Shut up and wear it.</li>
<li>You should.</li>

        <p>Strange how the people wearing masks don’t seem to be complaining about not being able to breathe. Even stranger how nurses have shown themselves to have perfectly normal breathing with the masks <em>and</em> plastic faceshields!</p>
<p>Or the guy who ran 2 kilometers while wearing ~15 masks after steadily smoking a cigar, you’d think he’d be passed out with all of those masks on!</p>
<p>Could just be me but it sounds like those who are “too smart” for masks are simply physically and genetically inferior to those who understand that masks aren’t going to reduce their oxygen intake.</p>
<p>Be honest, do you have a BMI over 30?</p>

        <p>I'm going to post the usual doomer-esque response to these that I've gotten, regardless of how illogical it is:</p>
<p>Why does the mask have to cover my nose to protect from droplets that only come out of my mouth?</p>
<p>- They say the droplets come out of your nose, too. I know that this is rare unless the person sneezes, though.</p>
<p>If social distancing works, why do we need masks (You can reverse this too)</p>
<p>- They say both work on their own, but it's even more effective when it comes to saving lives to do both. (I say it would be most effective to wear a hazmat suit, but we have to draw the line somewhere.)</p>
<p>If you are so worried about getting Coronavirus, why don't you stay home?</p>
<p>- They deserve to go out in society. If I'm a reckless person who doesn't like to follow rules (and a reckless person to them is someone who removes their mask for two minutes), I should stay home instead, because I don't deserve to go out!</p>
<p>Do you do this every flu season?</p>
<p>- They say no, we have a vaccine for the flu... but maybe we should every flu season!!!!1111!!!!11!!! Also, COVID is wayyyy worse than the flu!! Long-term damage!!</p>
<p>Some people are asymptomatic. By checking my temp. and letting me in without a mask, you are saying that asymptomatics cannot spread the disease. So how can you still say that asymptomatic people transmit it?</p>
<p>- Doomers: No one should let you in without a mask!! Temperature checks aren't good enough!!!</p>
<p>If mandatory masks are constitutional, can you point out where?</p>
<p>- Never got an answer to that.</p>
<p>Why is it OK to go to Wal-Mart but not to the beach?</p>
<p>- Food is essential!!! The beach isn't essential!!</p>
<p>If everybody can wear a mask because you can, can everybody dunk a basketball because Michael Jordan can?</p>
<p>- Wearing a mask isn't as hard as dunking a basketball!!!! Wearing a mask is so simple, my three-year-old child with asthma can do it!!!!</p>
<p>More children die of the flu than Coronavirus, so should we reopen schools like this every flu season?</p>
<p>- Doomers: WE HAVE A VACCINE FOR THE FLU!! Forced flu vaccines for everyone!! Also, maybe kids should stay home forever!! Or wear masks to school for the rest of their lives!!</p>
<p>Can you point out where you got this data?</p>
<p>- The CDC, the WHO, my governor, my mayor...</p>
<p>Can you show me how herd immunity doesn't work?</p>
<p>- You can get infected again after three months!! Someone got infected again!! ANTIBODIES DON'T LAST!!! (Probably a false positive the first time, but w/e. And this totally disproves the usefulness of a vaccine.)</p>
<p>If Fauci said masks don't work in the beginning of this and then changed his mind, why should we believe what he says now?</p>
<p>- There's so much about this virus we don't know!!!!! DoCtoRs ArE lEaRnInG nEw ScIeNcE eVeRyDaY!</p>
<p>Can you tell me why hydrocxychloroquineis ineffective?</p>
<p>- Because Trump said so!!! Trump is always wrong!!! And people who took hydroxychloroquine died!!! (Never mind mentioning that it was the fish-tank kind of hydroxychloroquine, not the medically prescribed kind).</p>
<p>Why are you telling me to wear a face covering that I can see through?</p>
<p>- Noooo!!! Don't wear that!! Your droplets can get through and infect meeeeeee!!!!!!</p>
<p>If this virus is so deadly, why don't we have to wear masks and socially distance from our family members that we live with?</p>
<p>- We ShOulD wEaR mAsKs aT HoMe AnD uSe SePaRaTe BaThRoOmS!!!!!</p>

        <p>I like how you phrased some of these like they’re dumb answers “Even my three year old can wear a mask”</p>
<p>“Food is essentiall!!!!!” Even though they’re just purely accurate responses.</p>
<p>Then you gave fancy strawman answers to others. “I deserve to go out” nobody has ever told you that.</p>
<p>As for why you never get a response to “Show me where the constitution says it’s okay to have mandatory masks” it’s because the request shows a severe lack of understanding for the constitution.</p>

<p>You've got, what, 2 weird documented cases of reinfection in the whole planet after 6 months? Out of 10 million?</p>
<p>And then you've got the fact that vaccines are being developed by dozens of pharma companies and vaccines work based on lasting immunity.      </p>
<p>Of course we know there is immunity and of course we know it lasts.</p>

<li>You also breathe through your nose. In fact, research shows that you have more covid concentrated in your nose than your mouth.</li>
<li>Social distancing does work well, but it’s not easy to stay 6 feet away from people. You can’t control who walks near you in a grocery store and those aisles are thin. Even walking down the street you can’t really prevent people from walking by you. If you wanted to go to a meal with someone and sat 6 feet apart the whole time, I’d say that’s safe.</li>
<li>I am not worried about getting covid. I’m young and healthy. I’m worried about the tremendous amount of unnecessary deaths. </li>
<li>Flus are not nearly as deadly and, more importantly, not nearly as contagious.</li>
<li>I do not approve of checking temperature and letting people in without a mask. That would be a dumb policy.</li>
<li>Things are constitutional when they are not forbidden by the constitution. For example, riding a bike is not unconstitutional.</li>
<li>Shopping is necessary, being on the beach is not. Still, I would approve of anyone going to the beach if they wore a mask the whole time.</li>
<li>Almost everyone can wear a mask because it does little to restrict air flow. It has nothing to do with whether or not I can.</li>
<li>This is false. The death toll for kids from the flu is about 100 per year. Children deaths from covid are in the thousands. Also, see answer 4.</li>
<li>Kinda weird to request sources when you have none, but... https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/</li>
<li>Herd immunity requires the majority of the population to have had the virus. This would represent tens of millions of unnecessary deaths in the world, and over 1.5 million in the US.</li>
<li>I’m not sure you want to start a credibility debate here. Masks have empirically been proven to greatly reduce the rate of transmission. What evidence is there for anything you claim?</li>
<li>Experimental trials clearly show it is ineffective. A first trial showed promising results, but larger trials could not replicate those. This is common in experimentation. </li>
<li>What?</li>
<li>While that would be safer, it is essentially infeasible. Wearing a mask when you are outside, on the other hand, is extremely easy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I answered all those questions, maybe you can answer one of mine.</p>
<p>Individual coroners release regional information about the amount of deaths in that county. They don’t need to look at cause. In total, the amount of deaths we have seen so far this year is over 200k than we saw last year at this time.</p>
<p>My question is, given that information, how can you not take covid seriously?</p>
<p>I see these possibilities:
1. A majority of coroners in the US are in on a massive conspiracy to inflate covid numbers, so they increase the amount of deaths and give fake names of diseased.
2. Those 200k deaths are coming from somewhere else. (Where?)
3. 200k deaths is unfortunate, but a necessary sacrifice against the tyranny of this “new normal”.
4. There’s nothing you can do about covid deaths. Masks do nothing.  (If you take this option, please explain why Europe’s numbers are now so much better than ours)</p>
<p>Or some 5th option I didn’t think of!</p>

        <p>&rt;1.  ⁠Why does the mask have to cover my nose to protect from droplets that only come out of my mouth?</p>
<p>Droplets come out of your nose as well</p>
<p>&rt;2. If social distancing works, why do we need masks (You can reverse this too)</p>
<p>Masks and social distancing work together to mitigate the spread of Covid.</p>
<p>&rt;3. If you are so worried about getting Coronavirus, why don't you stay home?</p>
<p>I do, as much as possible. But I still need to go to work and the store and things like that.</p>
<p>&rt;4. Do you do this every flu season?</p>
<p>I get a vaccine every flu season.</p>
<p>&rt;5.  Some people are asymptomatic. By checking my temp. and letting me in without a mask, you are saying that asymptomatics cannot spread the disease. So how can you still say that asymptomatic people transmit it?</p>
<p>I don’t know anywhere that lets you in mask-free after checking your temp, they just don’t let you in at all if your temperature isn’t safe.</p>
<p>&rt;6. If mandatory masks are constitutional, can you point out where?</p>
<p>That’s not how this works, you have to prove they somehow are disallowed by the constitution.</p>
<p>&rt;7. Why is it OK to go to Wal-Mart but not to the beach?</p>
<p>Because Walmart sells clothing, medicine and groceries, all things that are pretty necessary.</p>
<p>&rt;8. If everybody can wear a mask because you can, can everybody dunk a basketball because Michael Jordan can?</p>
<p>Terrible false equivalence, unless you’re trying to say you’re so unskilled that you struggle to put a mask on.</p>
<p>&rt;9. More children die of the flu than Coronavirus, so should we reopen schools like this every flu season?</p>
<p>We could always make sure people get their flu shots when they typically do not. Otherwise, yeah.</p>
<p>&rt;10. Can you point out where you got this data? </p>
<p>What data specifically?</p>
<p>&rt;11. Can you show me how herd immunity doesn't work? </p>
<p>Herd immunity only works if there’s an actual period of immunity after getting the virus.</p>
<p>&rt;12. If Fauci said masks don't work in the beginning of this and then changed his mind, why should we believe what he says now? </p>
<p>Because science and medicine pretty regularly come to new conclusions as new info is discovered? And not understanding that makes you kinda stupid? The same reason we don’t use cocaine in medicine quite so often anymore.</p>
<p>&rt;13. Can you tell me why hydrocxychloroquineis ineffective? </p>
<p>Because zero studies have found it to reliably reduce the risks from Covid-19?</p>
<p>&rt;14. Why are you telling me to wear a face covering that I can see through? </p>
<p>So that you don’t run into shit by blindfolding yourself.</p>
<p>&rt;15. If this virus is so deadly, why don't we have to wear masks and socially distance from our family members that we live with?</p>
<p>Because that’s a pretty unreasonable request, but if you fear you’ve contracted it you absolutely are recommended to socially distance from family. Given that many of the cases are spreading in the home after being brought in from elsewhere.</p>

<p>Well sweden ended up with deaths per 100000 at similar levels to us. So... no.</p>
<p>If they pulled it off (which they basically didn't) it would be more attributable to their accessible socialized medicine than anything else.</p>
<p>Canada is a good example. Right north of us and the results are night and day when compared to us.</p>

        <p>Do you want answers? Because--well, I don't consider myself a doomer, but I do take COVID seriously--I could answer all of these. Nothing I'd say would change your mind, but that wouldn't be the point. You seem to be presenting this like they're impossible to answer, and that people who care about COVID don't have answers to them. But they're easily answered. Most of them, honestly, boil down to "because we're compromising in order to balance going about our lives and halting the spread of the disease, so we're allowing behaviors which are not, in fact, optimal, but help a bit." Anyway, if you don't care about answers, that's fine. But I thought I'd offer. Especially #6. That's an easy one. They're constitutional under Jacobson v. Massachusetts, in which the Court upheld the right of government to impose mandatory public-health measures in response to health emergencies. That case dealt with compulsory vaccinations, but masks are constitutional under the same set of powers. Anyway. Have a great day.</p>

        <p>Wow, um, these questions don't really stump me, but I'll answer them anyway.</p>
<ol>
<li>You don't exhale as many droplets out your nose, but it's still some.</li>
<li>People often can't or don't follow strict social distancing. The mask is a basic tool that adds another layer of protection.</li>
<li>As many anti-maskers point out, we can't just shut down the economy. You have 2 extremes: total shutdown vs business as usual, both would be devestating. We want to be in the middle.</li>
<li>We did this the first time the common flu came. It was called the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Back then they did the same thing: wear masks, change business operations, stay home. But now we have herd resistance and a vaccine.</li>
<li>Any business that temp checks you then lets you in without a mask is run by an idiot.</li>
<li>Fishing licenses aren't specifically constitutional. You don't have to have something mentioned in the Constitution for a law to be made about it. There are too many things for that to be even remotely feasible.</li>
<li>You can go to the beach. I went a few weeks ago. But people were being idiots at specific beaches, so those ones got shut down.</li>
<li>Michael Jordan is an exceptional athlete. Given that we all have the muscle power to breathe, the ability to wear a mask is something common to the vast vast majority of humans. If you really can't due to a physical condition, that condition likely puts you at such a risk for Covid that you shouldn't even leave your house.</li>
<li>Covid has an estimated 6x the mortality rate of the flu, and unlike the flu it's new and we don't have a vaccine. Please stop comparing the two, the viruses aren't even related.</li>
<li>Which? I make a habit of checking my sources, so anything you have a question on I can provide a link to. For question #1, for example, <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jam.1997.10.105">this</a>.</li>
<li>It does work. That's one of the ideas behind vaccination. But letting us get it naturally either involves a lot of time or a lot of death. Currently our quarantine measures are taking us down the "long time" route, though not as a primary goal.</li>
<li>Part of science is changing your mind. We're always operating off limited information, the best we can do is take the reasonably safe route based on what we know at the time.</li>
<li>Dunno why, but they did some studies and it didn't help people, AND it involved heart risks. Though I do see one study that shows a halved death rate among very sick patients. So we'll see if the policy changes again (see previous answer).</li>
<li>If you can see through your mask you're wearing the wrong one.</li>
<li>Because it's too convoluted to try and do that with a close knit family. I read a doctor's story who has to do it with their family because she's exposed to the virus every day, and it's hell for her.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've got just one question in response now. If we were dealing with something like Ebola, with a mortality rate of 90% and viciously infectious, would you be following the quarantine guidelines?</p>

        <p>&rt; 1. Why does the mask have to cover my nose to protect from droplets that only come out of my mouth?</p>
<p>To protect yourself from other people's droplets. To not get sick, contribute to the spread of the virus and therefore put other at risk. </p>
<p>&rt; 2. If social distancing works, why do we need masks (You can reverse this too)</p>
<p>For the same reason you still wear a seat belt even though your car breaks work. </p>
<p>&rt;3. If you are so worried about getting Coronavirus, why don't you stay home?</p>
<p>I do most of the time and when I can't (work, groceries) I expect other to have basic common decency and wear a mask same as I do. </p>
<p>&rt; 4. Do you do this every flu season?</p>
<p>Corona is not a flue. It has killed 200,000 people in the US alone. </p>
<p>&rt; 5. Some people are asymptomatic. By checking my temp. and letting me in without a mask, you are saying that asymptomatics cannot spread the disease. So how can you still say that asymptomatic people transmit it?</p>
<p>Who's letting you in without a mask lol? </p>
<p>&rt; 6. If mandatory masks are constitutional, can you point out where?</p>
<p>If it doesn't specifically violate the Constitution then it's constitutional. Just like every other law... </p>
<p>&rt; 7. Why is it OK to go to Wal-Mart but not to the beach?</p>
<p>Because groceries are a necessity, your summer vacation isn't you entitled prick. </p>
<p>&rt; 8. If everybody can wear a mask because you can, can everybody dunk a basketball because Michael Jordan can?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.memeatlas.com/images/brainlets/brainlet-drilling-brain.jpg">Hmmm</a></p>
<p>&rt; 9. More children die of the flu than Coronavirus, so should we reopen schools like this every flu season?</p>
<p>Corona Virus has an overall death rate of 3-4% while the flu has one at 0.1%. Even if the former isn't so likely to affect children, they still contribute greatly to its spread. </p>
<p>&rt; 10. Can you point out where you got this data?</p>
<p>WHO's website. </p>
<p>&rt; 11. Can you show me how herd immunity doesn't work?</p>
<p>What? </p>
<p>&rt; 12. If Fauci said masks don't work in the beginning of this and then changed his mind, why should we believe what he says now?</p>
<p>Since when does changing your mind after being presented with new facts somehow invalidate your opinion? </p>
<p>&rt; 13. Can you tell me why hydrocxychloroquineis ineffective?</p>
<p>Because there's literally no evidence it's effective. </p>
<p>&rt; 14. Why are you telling me to wear a face covering that I can see through?</p>
<p>....? </p>
<p>&rt; 15. If this virus is so deadly, why don't we have to wear masks and socially distance from our family members that we live with?</p>
<p>Because the vast majority of people don't have multiple houses or ways to stay away from their family if they go out. That's why it's important to have basic human decency, be considered towards others and wear a mask in public. The poor guy you sneeze on in the subway might be heading towards his grandparents' house.</p>

        <p>I’m a medical student, so if you all are actually interested in having a discussion about these questions I can give my two cents </p>
<p>1) respiratory droplets also come out of your nose. Your nose and throat are connected and since you breath out of both, respiratory droplets come out of both </p>
<p>2) social distancing works okay. Masks work okay. Both reduce risk but neither is perfect. However if you do both at the same time, the risk drops to a somewhat acceptable level. Obviously the safest choice is still to stay home but people still need to go to the grocery store (for example) </p>
<p>3) again the safest choice is to stay home, but people still need to leave their house for essentials. Plus, with the lack of federal relief for many people, there’s no option except to go back to work even if they don’t necessarily feel comfortable doing so. It should also be pointed out that even if I stay home, I can still be screwed over by your actions. My 4 year old niece got covid from her nanny who got it from her roommate who got it from her boyfriend who got it because he went out to a bar in the middle of a pandemic. </p>
<p>4) With no masks and no social distancing, the flu kills about 60,000 people on a bad year. Even with masks and social distancing, covid has already killed 190,000+. The flu also has a vaccine that can be used to mitigate risk</p>
<p>5) I’m not sure what places are letting you in with no mask after just a temperature check. Everywhere around me requires you wear a mask at all times even after a temperature check. In any event, the risk of asymptomatic spread is a real concern and that’s why the safest option, as always, is to stay home as much as possible </p>
<p>6) the Supreme Court decided this in Jacobsen v. Massachusetts. If you’re interested in the reasoning, you can read their decision </p>
<p>7) wal-Mart sells goods that people need for survival so the risk of going there is unfortunately a necessary one. Going to the beach doesn’t hold the same leval of importance. Also, at least where I am, there are a lot of walking trails, parks, and other nature spots that are open for people to go walk around and get fresh air </p>
<p>8) It’s very possible that you’re wearing masks made of materials that are hard to breath through. Cloth masks and surgical masks are your best bet and should be quite easy to breath through. If you do have a medical condition which prohibits you from wearing a mask (of which there are few) then you have severely impaired lung function and are at serious risk of death from the virus and should be quarantining anyways.  N95s can be a little hard to breath through, but civilians are advised not to wear these anyways, so that they can be saved for front line workers </p>
<p>9) First off, I find it hard to imagine that you know this for sure. You’re comparing a virus that we have a hundred years of data on to a novel virus that we can’t quite know the effects of just yet. But even assuming that your statement is true, children can still spread the virus to their parents, grandparents and siblings. Those people may actually die and we know this virus is more lethal than the flu (hence the extra precautions) </p>
<p>10) The CDC has great data tracking. Even if, for some reason you don’t trust the CDC, the Trump administration has taken control of a fair amount of the data tracking and their numbers aren’t pretty either </p>
<p>11) Herd immunity would only be achieved when about 70% of the population has antibodies (this percentage changes according to the virus and this is probably a low estimate). Even assuming that the antibodies are lifelong (which is by no means a certainty) this would require about 250,000,000 Americans to get the virus. Even with only one percent of those people dying, that would put the death toll in the millions. This seems pretty unacceptable especially when other nations have gotten their infection rates under control with far fewer deaths </p>
<p>12) I’ll be honest and say that I havent kept track of every statement t that Fauci has made regarding masks, but it was my understanding that early on he was more cautioning against hoarding masks that may be needed for front line workers. I’m either case, it’s the nature of science to refine itself over time as new information becomes available. We knew nothing about this virus at the onset so naturally our approach to fighting it had to change as we got a better understanding of it. The most recent data shows that mask are effective and, when combined with social distancing, can reduce transmission rates by at least 90% </p>
<p>13) This is going to be long one, since I think a lot of people aren’t familiar with how this drug works or why it was initially trialed asa treatment for covid. So the initial logic behind using hydroxychloroquine (lets call it HCQ) was at least somewhat sound. It was discovered that a lot of the damage caused to the body by covid was actually due to an “over reaction” of the body’s own immune system causing a massive inflammatory response called a “cytokines storm.” HCQ is a known anti inflammatory drug (and this an immunosuppressant). So the thought was that by blunting the patients immune response, you could reduce the mortality of covid. That’s an important point by the way, HCQ was never a “cure” for covid. It was simply meant to reduce the mortality associated with covid infections. </p>
<p>But this was obviously a gamble. By immuno suppressing the patient you are reducing the effects of the cytokines storm but you’re also reducing the body’s ability to fight the virus in the first place. On top of that, HCQ has a fairly rough side effect profile. It’s not the most dangerous drug in the world, but especially in patients who are already very sick, it’s an extra concern. As research became available it became very clear that the gamble failed and the most recent research (which was a meta analysis of many many papers) showed that using HQC was actually associated with greater risk of mortality. </p>
<p>The basic idea wasn’t terrible though. And recently doctors have been using steroids (another type of anti inflammatory drug) to try and dull the cytokines storm and this has shown pretty decent results. Again, this isn’t a cure for covid, but it does help to reduce the number of people actually dying. </p>
<p>14) The recommendation is to wear a double layered cloth mask or a surgical mask. You normally shouldn’t be able to see through that. </p>
<p>15) You definitely should be aware of your living arrangement and trying to do what you can to not infect your family, but it’s simply not realistic to expect people to actually follow through with all those precautions at home. The focus should be on not bringing the virus into your home in the first place vs. how to stop the virus from spreading around your home. </p>
<p>Anyways, I hope all of this was clear/concise without being patronizing. I understand where people are coming from with all this. Our lives are being absolutely upended, but there’s good reason for that, unfortunately.</p>

        <p>&rt; 1. Why does the mask have to cover my nose to protect from droplets that only come out of my mouth?</p>
<p>Because you breath out of your nose too? And droplets leave your nose as well. I hope I am not the first person to tell you that.</p>
<p>&rt;2. If social distancing works, why do we need masks (You can reverse this too)</p>
<p>Same reason cars have brakes and airbags and crumple zones. Mitigating risk. Nothing works 100% so having multiple ways to keep is safe makes sense.</p>
<p>&rt;3. If you are so worried about getting Coronavirus, why don't you stay home?</p>
<p>I do for the most part. If everyone stayed home back in march, maybe we would be back to normal now.</p>
<p>&rt;4. Do you do this every flu season?</p>
<p>No. No flu season that I have seen has killed 200,000 americans.</p>
<p>&rt;5. Some people are asymptomatic. By checking my temp. and letting me in without a mask, you are saying that asymptomatics cannot spread the disease. So how can you still say that asymptomatic people transmit it?</p>
<p>I think you shouldn’t be let in without a mask.</p>
<p>&rt;6. If mandatory masks are constitutional, can you point out where?</p>
<p>Same place that allows the government to mandate you wear pants. </p>
<p>&rt;7. Why is it OK to go to Wal-Mart but not to the beach?</p>
<p>People need food. Unless the government was willing to have food delivered to everyone, there really was no avoiding that. That being said, go to the beach, get outside. Avoid crowds, wear a mask if that is not possible.</p>
<p>&rt;8. If everybody can wear a mask because you can, can everybody dunk a basketball because Michael Jordan can?</p>
<p>Is this your idea of a clever question? I’m sorry, you are not a clever person. If wearing a mask is an athletic feat for you, you are absolutely a huge risk of dying from any lung illness. </p>
<p>&rt;9. More children die of the flu than Coronavirus, so should we reopen schools like this every flu season? </p>
<p>In your hypotethical here, are all the teachers children? And the parents that live with the kids, are they children too? Kids are an enormous disease vector.</p>
<p>&rt;10. Can you point out where you got this data?
? Source: parents and teachers exist</p>
<p>&rt;11. Can you show me how herd immunity doesn't work?</p>
<p>It absolutely could work. The problem is, with the current 5% case mortality rate, we are looking at up to potentially 13 millions america deaths and that just doesn’t seem like  a good idea.</p>
<p>&rt;12. If Fauci said masks don't work in the beginning of this and then changed his mind, why should we believe what he says now?</p>
<p>Because that is how science works? It builds on itself. Feel free to listen to other scientists that have the backing of the scientific community, just don’t out faith in any quack with a white coat because he/she is saying what you want to hear. For example if he/she believes in demon sperm is the cause of cysts...maybe he/she isn’t a very good doctor.</p>
<p>&rt;13. Can you tell me why hydrocxychloroquineis ineffective?</p>
<p>I cannot, I am not a virus specialist so I have to listen to the experts. The experts are saying it isn’t a great treatment. </p>
<p>&rt;14. Why are you telling me to wear a face covering that I can see through?</p>
<p>I am not? I’m not sure what that means.</p>
<p>&rt;15. If this virus is so deadly, why don't we have to wear masks and socially distance from our family members that we live with?</p>
<p>If you have high risk family members you live with, you should. It just isn’t really feasible. Your family should each act like any of your choices are a choice for all of you. One person deciding to go to a party can absolutely impact all of you and should be thought of as such.</p>
