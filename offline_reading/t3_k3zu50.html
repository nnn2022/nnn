        <p>I’m not disagreeing with you about the authoritarian measures being taken place by the government of California. I’m just curious as to why these actions are being labeled as facistic. The ideological backbone of  fascism is a centralized government typically led by a dictatorship or an autocratic form of government that uses weaponized nationalism and racism as a weapon of control. Examples of this are nazi Germany, Mussolini’s Italy, Franco’s Spain, and Argentina under Juan Perón. All of these have the common denominator of using the nationalistic tendencies and racial hatred to seize power and silence opposition. What’s going on in California is seizing power through the fear of a virus which is an authoritarian power grab, but not racially induced or fueled on nationalism like we’ve seen in other fascistic government archetypes. The concept of democratic fascism is a paradox within its self, the notion that the people elect an autocratic/authoritarian leader to have absolute power and control just to have that rescinded every election term if voted out? It’s like you’re wrong but have the right idea. It’s not fascistic, nor communist, simply an abuse of power backed by corporate interest. Blatant authoritarianism. Thoughts?</p>

        <p>&rt; I’m just curious as to why these actions are being labeled as facistic. </p>
<p>Because the edicts being handed down by governors with no real legislative input is almost the exact definition of fascism?</p>
<p>&rt;The ideological backbone of fascism is a centralized government typically led by a dictatorship or an autocratic form of government that uses weaponized nationalism and racism as a weapon of control.</p>
<p>The one party government in Califrnia that has run the state for 30 years, has a Governor telling people that they can't leave their homes or invite others to their homes, anyone who dares to break the edicts issued without the legislative branch's input is most definately labeled as anti-american and anti-society... And I assure you there is no shortage of racism here in 2020 from all sides. BLM in general, but also the report after report on how Covid is even racist...</p>
<p>How are you missing all this stuff, buddy?</p>
<p>&rt;nationalistic tendencies</p>
<p>Every radio add telling you "We are in this together" and "We have to ensure the health of the nation" etc. etc. I mean literally - have you not been to a supermarket or listed to a radio or a Main Stream News outlet insist you have to wear masks and stay in your homes and not work to save the state and the country?</p>
<p>&rt; but not racially induced </p>
<p>Sure it is. Article after article insisting that minorities are far worse affected and therefore need to be even more locked down....</p>
<p>&rt;or fueled on nationalism</p>
<p>I'm just astounded you can ignore the constant drumbeat of "We need to be locked down for the sake of the nation". It's been going on for 10 months now. 10 months straight.</p>
<p>It's Hypochondria Fascism, buddy. Democratic Fascism. Just like Democratic Socialism. Fascism and Socialism have been intertwined since their inception.</p>
<p>&rt;just to have that rescinded every election term if voted out?</p>
<p>Is it rescinded every election term? Nope. The Democrat may term out - rarely if ever defeated... but is replaced with a carbon copy that pushes the same party line. As long as the party line is being pushed.</p>
<p>&rt;It’s like you’re wrong but have the right idea</p>
<p>It's actually more like you are wrong because you are married to the idea that left wingers can't be fascists. And you are acting as if the edicts handed down by governors are somehow democratic, when they aren't. The illusion of democracy is not really democracy.</p>
<p>&rt; Thoughts?</p>
<p>You seem to require the fascist kill people like the Nazis did, and don't allow for the idea that fascism can evolve. You can't accept that fascists could recognize that genocide wasn't good for it and change up that tactic a bit, and use popular culture and peer pressure rather than a gas chamber. Incite protests and riots rather than use uniformed police... oh wait - I guess that was an old tactic too. lol.</p>
<p>Anyway - the evolution of fascism is what you are not allowing for.</p>
