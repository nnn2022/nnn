    <strong>Any good online colleges for game design and programming?</strong>
    <p><p>I was going to a community college and was going to transfer to a university, but now that university is going full-on social distancing corona bs, and my college is still doing remote learning which I am struggling with, so I figured I should just go learn programming someplace where I don’t have to put up with this crap. Moving to an open, non-corona city is not something we have the money to do at the moment. Currently know up to Calculus II. Any place I can go online? Please, I need help. My last tests are coming up and, despite all my studying and hard work, the remote learning just is not doing it for me, so I need something to fall back on.</p></p>

        <p>I would say maybe skip the college idea and go hands on. I’m not employed in the field, per se, but i think they hire based on skill rather than merit of a degree. If you can do stuff and figure out problems while trying to code something (and have it to show off) youre better off than most degree holders who have no portfolio. </p>
<p>Just find a challenge for yourself and figure out how to conquer it. Code a game of snake. Read up on what games are coded in if youre trying to go full scale game design. </p>
<p>Then look at job listings for reqs for the job. Dip your toes in those languages or software</p>
