        <p>If your side has to cancel, censure, villify, threaten, deplatform, or otherwise, it's because your arguement is so poor it falls apart upon challenge, debate, or even simple questioning</p>
<p>If your side has to resort to this due to a weak premise or position that doesn't hold up to debate you are not supporting the needs and wants of your society, country, people, you are pushing an agenda. </p>

        <p>That's the hard part my guy </p>
<p>Usually the agenda is in hiding, as it's either unpopular or non-survival for most people</p>
<p>However there there are hints.</p>
<p>During the lockdowns we had the largest wealth transfer in modern history. Only a few in ancient history compares, eg Atilla the Hun. Fall of Rome.</p>
<p>Who benefits from endless lockdowns, mask mandates, highly encouraged experimental vaccine jabs, people devided as much and on as many idealogies as possible, race, religion, class, lockdowns no lock downs, masks no masks, left versus right, Marxism versus Capitalism?</p>
<p>The other hint is when one side goes through every effort to cancel, censure, deplatform, villify, and attack oneside to desperately prevent debate, challenge, or even basic question is both a red flag and a red herring</p>

        <p>I was offered 3 or 4 sources and accepted said offer. But since you decided to comment let's play ball. Which billionaires, who weren't ruining small businesses pre pandemic, used the pandemic to ruin small businesses? 
Which politicians, who were acting in the benefit of the public interest pre-pandemic, were paid to not act in the best interest of the public during the pandemic. I'm not saying you're wrong but until you have proof of this is it's simply conjecture. You can have your opinions but they aren't facts if they can't be proven.</p>

        <p>I'm actually shocked that you haven't heard about the wealth transfer. It has been discussed frequently by almost all of the news stations on both sides of the political aisle. The wealth transfer is certainly a factor. </p>
<p>I personally see increasing dependence on the government and restricting freedom as being the primary goals in this situation. The wealth transfer is secondary.</p>

        <p>No, no I've heard of it and I'm not surprised by it. I mean it's the purest definition of capitalism; to capitalize. I don't believe it was an agenda though. I believe some saw an opportunity and took advantage. If you're not happy about it find a more communist locale. </p>
<p>What I'm questioning is the hidden agenda of this whole thing. You're saying it's increased dependence on the government and restricting freedom, to what end?</p>

        <p>So a large part of the wealth transfer is due to small businesses being forced to close their doors due to the lockdowns while billion dollar corporations were simultaneously allowed to continue operations. Combine that with high rates of unemployment and you have a serious hit to the lower and middle class and a huge boost to the ultra wealthy, who saw much of their competition forced to close their doors either temporarily by the government, or permanently due to the temporary lockdowns and restrictions. Restaraunts were hit especially hard.</p>
<p>I think the idea of why the government would want to have more control over the population is really just as simple as: people in government are power hungry and want control over a dependant population. A disease like covid, whether you believe it to be overblown and barely worse than the flu, or a horrific disease with the potential to wipe out half of the planet, offers a <em>perfect</em> opportunity for the government to seize power and tighten their grip on the people, which again, they do because they desire power.</p>

        <p>It can be argued that small businesses did not adapt quickly or effectively. I dont know where you're located but I know here in Ontario curbside and online shopping have been allowed throughout the pandemic. Of course more service centric businesses suffered because it's not possible to provide those services online but it's not like big businesses in the same sector had any advantages there; a small local barber shop was just as closed as a big major chain. I will agree that large online retailers like Amazon made a killing but this was just as much the fault of the government mandated lockdowns as it was the small businesses not seeing the writing on the wall pre-pandemic. Here in Canada major retailers that refused to adopt an online platform were going out of business well before the pandemic hit. Brick and mortar was already slowly dying the pandemic just sped it up. As for restaurants, that is a historically unstable industry, pandemic or not a lot of those businesses would not be around in a couple years. 
Higher rates of unemployment lead to less purchasing power which would lead to lower sales of non essential goods. So I'm not sure how that gives the ultra rich a boost. I think low interest aka cheap money might have given the ultra rich a boost but I don't think high unemployment plays a factor.</p>
<p>Power for the sake of power? I truly have a hard time grasping that concept. I see power as a means not an end.</p>
<p>Plus if you bankrupt your tax base how much power do you really have?</p>

<p>Or something in between, right? I believe it's a new virus and any new virus can be dangerous until we have the right interventions and prevention in place. Some viruses are more complex and require more time and resources to discover and develop the right interventions and preventions for than others.</p>

        <p>You made some good points about businesses failing to adapt, but at the same time, I would say that the majority of small businesses were unable to deal with the rapid shift in regulation brought on by the government as effectively as large chains are for a myriad of reasons. Call that what you want, but I can tell you that government mandated lockdowns are not capitalist. The wealth transfer was caused by the government response to the virus as well as some changes in consumption habits in the populace primarily due to fear. </p>
<p>High unemployment widens the wealth gap by decreasing the % of the money supply in the hands of the poor and middle class. Jeff Bezos is fine with high unemployment so long as his warehouses and vans are staffed, and people are spending their stimulus checks on amazon. </p>
<p>Power for the sake of power. Absolutely. But if you refuse to believe that, I can list a plethora of ends that would explain politicians and the overall government consolidating power: money, status, safety, lack of dissidents, competition with other countries who already have more control over their populations, building a legacy, a misguided sense of morality built on paternalism (wanting to feel like you're helping others by controlling them because they can't be trusted to make their own decisions), etc. </p>
<p>My quote about covid as a harmless and overblown virus vs. it as a global catastrophe was simply meant to say that no matter which you believe, or if you believe somewhere in between, it doesn't change the fact that a pandemic like this is a perfect opportunity for the government to consolidate power. That's all I was saying.</p>

        <p>&rt; I can tell you that government mandated lockdowns are not capitalist</p>
<p>No one would disagree with this statement. That being said it can still be argued that some, if not all, of the transfer of wealth was a result of capitalist big businesses exploiting an opportunity created by, what some might consider, authoritarian policies. The opportunity itself need not be capitalist, its the exploitation of that opportunity for the furtherance of your personal wealth that I would consider capitalist. </p>
<p>&rt;But if you refuse to believe that</p>
<p>It's not that I refuse, I just have a hard time with this concept because it implies that governments (in this case across the globe) are nefarious in nature and have little to no interest in the common good. This goes against my personal, moral, belief that people are generally good rather than evil. That isn't to say you're wrong. No opinion on this matter is wrong. It just means that we do not share the same moral ideology (which is fine, differences are what make life interesting). I would say that, collectively, world governments made some pretty big mistakes during this pandemic due to untested, knee jerk reactions, to what many in the science community determined to be a dangerous novel virus and then attempted to "mask" (no pun intended) their incompetence with back peddling and finger pointing. In Canada, as a whole, there are glaring problems with our public health care system dating back decades. Rather than admit these systemic problems, and start to fix them, the government attempted to use finger pointing and pretty obvious smear campaigns to show how they are the better party. It has been a lot of pandering and pre-election campaigning because they believe the survivability of a political party rests solely on its approval rating. My hope is that our leaders come to together, recognize the issues the pandemic exposed, and take steps to correcting those issues. It would be hard work but would also increase their approval rating. I think what makes it difficult is the fact that the opposition will continue to put up roadblocks because the party in power will be credited with "the fix" effectively lowering the oppositions approval rating. I suppose it could be reasonably concluded that the oppositions motivations are selfish (gaining power) and the party in power's efforts are hindered by this.</p>
<p>&rt;
My quote about covid as a harmless and overblown virus vs. it as a global catastrophe was simply meant to say that no matter which you believe, or if you believe somewhere in between</p>
<p>For sure, I get it. I just wanted to make it clear that I stand somewhere in the middle. </p>
<p>At the end of the day the way the term "agenda" is thrown around by many people makes it sound like this was a plan started long before the pandemic to accomplish some dark, undefined, nefarious goals. From what I gather in this back and forth with you, you do not land in that camp and more reasonably believe that the governments saw an opportunity to consolidate power and that big business, independent of the government, saw an opportunity to create more wealth. If that is the case we agree on that basic premise however I believe it was the governments not in power who are taking advantage of the opportunity and that big business is just up to its old capitalist tricks. </p>
<p>&rt;High unemployment widens the wealth gap by decreasing the % of the money supply</p>
<p>Based on this statement though high unemployment does not lead to prosperity for either side, For example if the money supply is $100, you have $80 and I have $20 and we decrease the supply by 10% but you retain your $80 I would now only have $10 thus increasing the gap without increasing your wealth. 
Regardless of this example high unemployment creates the need for stimulus. Stimulus effectively causes hyper-inflation by way of increasing the money supply rather than decreasing it. This decreases the purchase power of each individual dollar and actually dilutes wealth. To offset this dilution big business finds way to increase the amount of money they have by increasing cost of consumer goods. That increase in cost, due to hyper inflation, to the end user is what created the large transfer of wealth. It certainly was stimulus which contributed to the "transfer of wealth" however large proportions of that transfer came in the form of bail outs to major airlines etc...not bailing out these large business would cause a much larger economic collapse (consider the number of people who's paycheck depends on big business) and would actually hurt the low and middle class more. Also (not sure how it was handled where you're from) here in Ontario small business were also provided with bailout options as well (how effective they were can be argued). The solution to the wealth problem at hand is equal distribution of wealth, the most common means for that redistribution is communism and I dont think any of us want that.</p>

        <p>You do realize that there is an entire field of medicine  consisting highly trained doctors and specialist that work specifically with infectious disease right?   I haven't seen one ID specialist come forward and say anything contradicting Covid. If you can find one please share. </p>

        <p>"Highly trained" is a good way to describe those doctors.</p>
<p>Exactly, they were trained to agree with those who give them grants.</p>
<p>And those who disagree have been silenced, censored, debunked, fact-checked, and just loose their jobs and licences.</p>
