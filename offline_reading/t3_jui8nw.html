    <strong>Uncomfortable Shopping Experiences</strong>
    <p><p>I wasn’t sure where else to post this, so I guess I’ll make my own. I have gone to my local Apple Store twice, inside the mall, and the shopping experience has been so uncomfortable. I understand they’re “following state guidelines,” and being in California we have a lot of draconian ones, but the stark contrast between my company’s comparatively lax guideline interpretations is just annoying. </p>
<p>You are greeted by actual security personnel, from a 3rd party security company. If that’s non unnerving enough, they (ask to) take your temperature, and ask if you have “covid symptoms” and “are healthy.” (First of all, how should I quantify healthy? I kinda eat like crap, don’t really exercise, and I could lose about 15 pounds; does that count as healthy? And how would I know if I’m “healthy” from covid, considering it’s very common to be asymptomatic? Am I not allowed in if I have an unrelated illness?) Then they make you stand outside the store on a round Apple sticker, like you’re a huge inconvenience to just let in the damn store by yourself, if they’ll even let you in. If they do, you have to be escorted in like a child. I felt like I was in a communist country the free times I’ve gone to the mall. </p>
<p>My store doesn’t do anything like this, we allow anyone inside our waiting room. We don’t take people’s temperatures and question them about their personal medical health, we don’t have little circles where people are allowed to stand, and we haven’t hired a security company to all but frisk people on the way in. Granted, most people go home while we work on their cars (automotive dealership), and we have spread out our seating some. But we aren’t forcing anyone to do anything. We don’t even force masks on people, though we do offer them to people who aren’t wearing one.  Why are some companies so strict while others are much more lenient? </p>
<p>These weird shopping experiences have just made me uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain.</p></p>

        <p>Yep. I only went in to pick up a new Apple Watch earlier than it could be delivered so I could gift my old one to my younger sister for Christmas, and to exchange a damaged band. Otherwise I am ordering almost everything now. But all these rules and rituals have me not going out shopping anymore, even to the grocery store, or only when I absolutely need to. I feel like a hermit.</p>

        <p>Me and a friend experienced this at Apple in Palm Desert. Surreal. My friend wanted to go in. There were armed security guards outside and apparently people waiting had booked online to see a store associate. So we couldn’t have gone in anyway!  We also got yelled at in Starbucks. What a shitty day all round really.</p>

        <p>The security at mine wasn’t armed, but it’s definitely weird. I won’t be going there again any time soon. Not that I usually do. </p>
<p>There was also a huge line for Bath &amp; Body Works, snaked in front of the store waiting to be allowed in, all standing on a special little circle. They are all inside the mall already, is it really going to make a difference if they’re waiting in a line outside the store versus inside it moving around? </p>
<p>I just don’t understand why we are doing this for any virus, much less one with such a high recovery rate. It’s insane!</p>

        <p>I will never ever understand all this. Never Except to say this is the result of the msm’s fear narrative. I always wondered if it were possible to frighten people so much they became compliant. Now I think we all know. Scares the shit out if me, tbh. Oh, I took my watch in to a local jewelry store on Friday. She was dressed in like a hazmat suit. She made me put the watch in this basket. She then used this weird instrument which she hovered over my watch rather like those things airport security use when you pass through security. I asked her what’s going on. She says it sanitizes my watch??!!  WTF!! Madness</p>

        <p>What the hell. I remember at the start of all this, I was using my phone soap sanitizer for my phone, because it seemed like it was much worse than it actually is. That lasted probably about 2 weeks for me, maybe even less, where I just forgot and then gave up. I didn’t want to be obsessively sanitizing my things just because I could catch something. At this point, I’m not even sure why that would even matter now. </p>
<p>At work I used gloves to handle people’s car keys. credit cards, and money because I thought they’d prefer it. Now I don’t even bother and not one customer has said anything about it. I’m so over this. I’m ready to go back to normal now.</p>

        <p>I think these chains are setting us up to get rid of brick-and-mortar stores forever. Make the real-world shopping experience so onerous and unpleasant that it drives everyone to shopping online.</p>
<p>Think of the advantages for them:</p>
<p>- No more overhead, rents, or maintenance.</p>
<p>- Far fewer staff to pay.</p>
<p>- No requirement to have a distribution network to keep stores stocked.</p>
<p>- Outsource warehousing and shipping to lowest-bidder third parties.</p>
<p>- Customer "service" can be cut back to a minimum, and what little is left can be outsourced to Rajeev in Bombay for $5.00/hour.</p>
<p>And most importantly of all (which makes tax-hungry governments drool) - the ability to track every transaction, mine even more of our personal data, deluge us with targeted advertising, and eliminate the ability to pay in cash!</p>

        <p>&rt; considering it’s very common to be asymptomatic? </p>
<p>You mean not having anything. Well it's very simple how to handle these situations. You tell those strangers who ask questions about your health, if they have proof that you carry disease, then to f*ing prove it. Otherwise to stfu because it's a criminal offense to accuse someone of something without evidence. What they going to do? arrest you for...existing? Or because maybe you will kill someone in the future? Is this how it works now?</p>

        <p>Part of that theater is because they are the biggest company in the world and lawyers are chomping at the bit to sue them on behalf of a customer or store workers who thinks they got covid there. </p>
<p>Smaller stores don’t have enough money to attract lawyers so they can be more lax.</p>
