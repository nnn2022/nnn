    <strong>They’re running out of time.</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t know how many of you have noticed how much faster time is moving these days.</p>
<p>But I believe this is a major element causing these programs and agendas to being pushed forward at warp speed pace.  They know their time is short.  Whether you want to take that figuratively or literally, I think they’ve become quite desperate.  </p>
<p>They’re rolling this out too quickly, and it’s backfiring.</p></p>

        <p>I've thought this too. Are we really sheep headed to the slaughter, or are the brilliant (albeit evil) minds that are behind this shit capable of fucking up, just like the rest of us?</p>
<p>The forces guiding this pandemic know the human mind inside and out, especially with the help of internet-derived data. But we shouldn't abandon all hope because of that, because at the end of the day, humans are at the helm of this, and humans are far from perfect.</p>

        <p>&rt; yes the aliens are demons and can exist in a dimension we can’t see. </p>
<p>I agree with you there.  But I believe they can enter/pass through our dimension at times.  It’s heavy stuff but I recommend researching the missing411 cases (CanAm Missing Project). </p>
<p>I really don’t know what to make of the stereotypical alien morphology/myth but... I do believe that we are in a spiritual war with some kind of powerful demonic force, which includes actual physical beings.  That’s just an opinion I have formed based on what I have researched.  Of course I’m not claiming to be right about that.  Ultimately though, all that I can <em>know</em> is my own experiences, which do not personally confirm nor support the existence of so called aliens</p>

        <p>This is the question that is running through my mind every waking moment of my day. Based on my own personal experiences, I truly believe we’re leveling up as humans, and that there are outside forces aiding us. I’m not even going to speculate who they are, because I don’t know. I have my beliefs, but I keep them to myself for the most part because they’re personal. I grew up religious then fell out of it most of my adult life (I’m 46F), though I’m a spiritual person, and I’ve pretty much believed the Bible is bs, but my views are changing because the things that are happening are actually in there, and for the first time I see the Bible as prophesy, in the same way we analyze things Nostradamus said. And then my mind wanders back to all the programming we’ve received via all media forms, that God doesn’t exist, all the satanic programming from celebrities, and I realize “this shit is real- this is really happening.” It’s just crazy, but undeniable.</p>
<p>And then I think, what if they’re all in on it, we’re just being placated so we don’t rise up (because we’d win- it wouldn’t even be a contest). But then I look at the evidence I’ve seen. But then I think “if they’re all in on it, they’re just playing ‘good cop/bad cop.” Then I think about my own personal experiences, how my abilities have leveled up, that time is absolutely speeding up, how last year in the garden nothing grew, no flowers bloomed (and I mean <em>none</em>), and this year my yard is like a rain forest, it’s just breathtaking. I already have fully ripe strawberries! In May! But these things are ethereal, otherworldly, and it’s hard to bounce between everything I see happening, and everything I’ve experienced that’s unexplainable... unprovable. Does any of this make sense? I’m high.</p>

        <p>Yep, watched it the other day, every last human being needs to see it, it doesn’t even feel like five hours because it’s so enthralling. That guy put his entire life on the line in that video, and if there is a heaven he has a seat at the table, no doubt. It drove every last thing home for me, blew my mind like Fall/Cabal did (and still is). They’ve been priming us for this for decades. When HC lost, they had to start scrambling, and that’s when they started making dumb mistakes. And then I think “maybe the jab was their objective, to which they’ve been successful.” Enough people have received it that if they’re spreading airborne aids, they achieved it.</p>
<p>My gut tells me this is all real, this is really happening, no more conspiracy theory because now we have proof, I’m just battling my rational, programmed mind right now.</p>

        <p>Here’s my take on aliens. I’m not saying they don’t exist, but they don’t need permission to make their presence known, and I’m pretty sure if they wanted to they could do it without it being covered up. I don’t believe this reality is even remotely like they’ve told us it is, but I can’t say for sure what it is. I have theories, and I have my own personal experiences, and I trust those more than anything they’ve told us.</p>

        <p>Omg, yes, it’s one of my favorite subjects. I love the retconned sub, have posted a lot there over the years. I love quantum physics, I’m pretty damn sure I’ve consciously experienced a quantum Immortality moment. I’ve been attacked by a shadow person physically, and I’ve mentally been attacked by negative entities (I’m a psychic/medium/empath). I know for a fact what’s lurking in the shadows because I’ve experienced it, I’ve experienced countless ME’s, I’m working on getting certified to teach the LOA. I know there’s more than just this 3D world. Everything happening is just so unbelievable, I can’t keep up.</p>

        <p>I personally am not too informed on the implications of religion in the grand scheme of the pandemic. I grew up catholic, went to sunday school and the works, but after I got confirmed I naturally stopped going to church, because it just didn't resonate with me beyond being an extra opportunity where I can dick around with my friends. Somewhere along the line, that's all it became. I see the value in religion because it can give you sound principles, but I personally do not subscribe to any organized religion.</p>
<p>But I look at it more from a personal autonomy standpoint. Government is tasked with maximizing our personal choice while also taking the public safety implications of those choices into account. Choosing where that line is drawn is a pretty sensitive decision. Can we limit what medical choices we can all comfortably make because it is justified in these circumstances? That's something that's not being considered carefully enough, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Also, I'm pretty baked too.</p>

        <p>I started to reply to this last night but I was getting too tired and it got windy (and it still may).</p>
<p>First, we are sovereign beings, and we have a innate right to make decisions for our own bodies. Just because laws have been enacted that we are forced into following just to live doesn’t make them right. Laws are needed when our choices affect others right to sovereignty. You can’t take another life, violate someone’s rights to safety and security, steal their property, assault their body.</p>
<p>Me not getting vaccinated affects me. If you are vulnerable, it’s your responsibility to safeguard your own life, not mine. I’m not going into care facilities or hospitals, and if you’re a vulnerable person who’s at the grocery store freaking out because I’m not wearing a mask, why are you there? Especially when they accommodated you with curbside pick-up or delivery? This is common sense we’ve always followed with the flu and colds. If I’m sick I stay home, I don’t go around town spreading it.</p>
<p>The difference here is they’ve weaponized it, and you can now tell exactly whose minds are ripe for programming. </p>
<p>Here’s what the dialogue <em>should</em> be:</p>
<p>“Okay people, we have vaccines. They ARE NOT FDA approved, they are only approved for emergency use. You honestly don’t need it because the survival rate of Covid is so high for most, but we know many of you want it for your own reasons, so here it is. This is new technology being used, and we have no idea what the long-term effects will be. Because we don’t know the affects yet, we will not make it mandatory. Here are all of the ingredients, please research them so you can make the most informed decision possible. Because these vaccines are not FDA approved as safe, we are not liable for any harm that results, you are voluntarily signing up to be our animal trials. You should know that there are several medications that have been safely used for decades that treat this successfully, but we realize many of you want a vaccine, so here it is, but this statement serves as our notification that <em>we are not liable for any adverse reactions you have to the vaccine.</em></p>
<p>What we’re missing here is honesty and transparency. People have been brainwashed into not believing their eyes. If this was a true pandemic, we’d know it. Both of my 90+ year-old grandparents had it, were hospitalized with pneumonia, my grandfather died, he had co-morbidities, my grandmother recovered and is back home. I know two other people that had it, and yes it was horrible for them, but they recovered and are fine, one of them even quit smoking because of it. But that’s it. </p>
<p>We have never once heard in history that we vaccinate to protect others- we vaccinate to protect ourselves. People have been led to believe there are hundreds of millions of people that can’t get the vaccine and wE mUsT pRoTeCt tHeM, when the truth is they’re a very small percentage of the overall population. The flu kills these same vulnerable people. Hell, even a cold can kill them. A vaccine (not that that’s what this is) does not magically kill a virus and stop its spread, it simply primes the body to fight it. Our society has been so dumbed down and brainwashed about our own health that people don’t even research or question things. They’ve been so programmed to bE aFrAiD that they don’t realize the cure might be as bad (or worse) as the disease. And those same people that were coerced through fear to be the animal trial can’t reconcile that those of us standing back and watching are <em>also</em> concerned about our health. They’re not actually worried about others, that’s just their cover story because they’re afraid of dying because they can’t see facts when they’re glued to the inside of their eyelids.</p>
<p>So let’s pretend for the sake of conversation that this is truly a deadly disease, say the bird flu with a 56% mortality rate. A true pandemic. Half our family gone, houses with a red X spray painted on the door. People have been brainwashed into believing those of us not subscribing to this bs would be acting the exact same way, and that’s not true. Would I take an experimental vaccine if my chance of dying from the disease is 56%? I just might. Would I wear a mask? Most likely. Because I’d believe my <em>eyes</em>, not a bunch of talking heads whose words don’t gel with what I’m actually seeing and experiencing.</p>
<p>I’ve said this before somewhere here, but I honestly believe this was a real-life extension of Event 201. There’s only so much you can learn on paper. They needed to know how gullible we are, who the sheep are and who the opposition is. How much they could control the information and narrative. Who in positions of authority are in their pocket, and what they needed to do to get them there. Dinner is simmering in the pot, and it’s about to get served up if we don’t wake people the fuck up.</p>
<p>Yep, got windy.</p>

        <p>It has occurred to me over the past few years (well before the "pandemic" plot) that things appeared to be...accelerating at an irregular rate. I'd say it first started to become readily apparent in or around 2015. That was roughly when identity politics began to become an overt obsession, rather than the more subversive one that it had been mostly relegated to previously. Well, at least from my own observations, at any rate.  </p>
<p>Since then, I've often thought that the "powers that be" might just be overplaying their hand. Overconfidence, perhaps. Or maybe something else spurred them on.  </p>
<p>Not that I'm 100% convinced that there even is some kind of elite cabal controlling things from the shadows. I do consider it to be possible, though. But at the same time, I consider all kinds of things to be "possible". I am, of course, certain that there exist numerous different groups of "elites" out there vying for power. But that much is plainly obvious. Whether any (or all) of them are in collusion with one another is up in the air. It seems less likely for that to be the case, if only due to the tendency of powerful individuals to be highly averse to sharing said power.  </p>
<p>Then again...this COVID shit show has been oddly coordinated throughout the world. Too coordinated to just be a coincidence. The overall complacency of the majority of the population (at least in most Western countries) may have been what caused "them" (assuming there is a "them", just for the sake of speculation) to act all of a sudden. It remains to be seen whether they were too hasty or not.  </p>
<p>Or maybe it's all just chaos. I could see it going either way.</p>

        <p>It makes me think of Revelation 12:12:
Therefore, rejoice, O heavens! And you who live in the heavens, rejoice! But terror will come on the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you in great anger, knowing that he has little time.”
Revelation 12:12 NLT
https://bible.com/bible/116/rev.12.12.NLT</p>
<p>And that Scripture gets referenced in verse three of this hymn: </p>
<p>1
We are living, we are dwelling, 
In a grand and awful time,
In an age on ages telling– 
To be living is sublime.
Hark! the waking up of nations, 
Gog and Magog to the fray;
Hark! what soundeth? Is creation 
Groaning for her latter day?</p>
<p>2
Christian, rouse and arm for conflict, 
Nerve thee for the battlefield;
Bear the helmet of salvation, 
And the mighty gospel shield;
Let the breastplate, peace, be on thee, 
Take the Spirit’s sword in hand;
Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then, 
In Jehovah’s strength to stand.</p>
<p>3
And the prince of evil spirits, 
Great deceiver of the world!
He who at the blessed Jesus 
Once his deadly weapons hurled,
Cometh with unwonted power, 
Knowing that his reign will cease
When the kingdom shall be given 
To the mighty Prince of Peace.</p>
<p>4
Christians, rouse! fight in this warfare, 
Cease not till the victory’s won;
Till your Captain loud proclaimeth, 
“Servant of the Lord, well done!”
He, alone, who thus is faithful, 
Who abideth to the end,
Hath the promise, in the kingdom 
An eternity to spend.</p>

        <p>Maybe. I don't know. But like 1 John 2:18 says:<br>
Dear children, the last hour is here. You have heard that the Antichrist is coming, and already many such antichrists have appeared. From this we know that the last hour has come.</p>
<p>Regarding the "vaccines", look at Revelation 18:23:<br>
The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The happy voices of brides and grooms will never be heard in you again. For your merchants were the greatest in the world, and you deceived the nations with your sorceries.</p>
<p>The word translated "sorceries" is the Greek word "pharmakeia" that we get our words pharmacology and pharmaceutical from. In the ancient world it was probably drugs that led to ecstatic religious experiences. But maybe the final judgment of God against "Babylon" in this passage is against the kind of pharmaceutical wickedness and deception that's going on in the world right now.</p>
<p>You also have to look at the current situation in Israel and Jerusalem. Turkey and Iran are both promising to destroy the Jews (God's chosen people for himself from among the nations) and to "liberate" Jerusalem. But God has said:</p>
<p>Zechariah 12:2-3, 10</p>
<p>2 I will make Jerusalem like an intoxicating drink that makes the nearby nations stagger when they send their armies to besiege Jerusalem and Judah. 3 On that day I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock. All the nations will gather against it to try to move it, but they will only hurt themselves.<br>
...<br>
10 “Then I will pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on the family of David and on the people of Jerusalem. They will look on me whom they have pierced and mourn for him as for an only son. They will grieve bitterly for him as for a firstborn son who has died.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/zechariah/12.htm">https://biblehub.com/nlt/zechariah/12.htm</a></p>
<p>So...<br>
Luke 21:36 Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.”</p>

<p>11 “Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. Whoever is victorious will not be harmed by the second death.</p>

        <p>This is all blowing my mind, and has been a theme these last couple of weeks. When I think about the smear campaign against God and the Bible, and compare it to the smear campaign being used against us, when all we’re doing is trying to expose the lies and agenda, I can’t help but come to the conclusion they do it because it’s the only control they have over it. It had spread too far and wide for them to be able to remove it completely, so all they could do was attempt to discredit it, like they have us. Thank you for sharing those- they’ve validated so much.</p>

        <p>It's because of many technologies disruptors that can give back much power to individuals. 3D printing, decentralized currencies, dark web, open source project etc. With internet and innovation, we do not need any governments or big corporations leading us. We can rule ourselves in a decentralized and better structure, which ultimately reduces their power!</p>
