    <strong>"No vaccine, no service."</strong>
    <p><p>It seems like we're now entering into a world of 
segregation between vaxxers and non vaxxers.</p>
<p>Certain aspects of life are only going to be accessible if you're vaccinated.  </p>
<p>We're already stating to see reports for travel and tourism, health care and sports and entertainment industries mandating vaccine service only. </p>
<p>"No vaccine, no service."</p>
<p>The labels have already begun, ie vaxers and anti vaxers.   Even the word "anti" places a negative notion on the term.  </p>
<p>As a society, we're fighting amongst ourselves.  All the while Governments are exerting more control over its citizens and inflation keeps increasing.  The vast majority of people are unaware and are more concerned if you got your vaccine or not.</p>
<p>Money and control.</p></p>

        <p>I think the only fair way to solve this would be this:</p>
<p>First of all, the government cannot discriminate. We all pay taxes and enjoy the right of citizenship. The government cannot strip you of that. </p>
<p>If private businesses want to refuse service to unvaccinated people, then they should also be allowed to refuse service to vaccinated people. </p>
<p>Ie, if you've been vaccinated, you're not the type of person I want to associate with, so please leave.</p>

        <p>You're in for a rude awakening if you think the government wouldn't discriminate or limit you service. </p>
<p>Not to be a tin hat Nostradamus, but I think with yesterday's announcement of the masks and new information of the vaccinated overwhelming getting sick, I feel we just hit the tipping point. Too much has been exposed.</p>
<p>The very thing you think isn't going to happen...the gov will be happy to prove you wrong.</p>
<p>I think we feel the same about this whole thing fellow redditor, but unfortunatly I have a bit more gloomy outlook on all this</p>

        <p>So many people looking for validation about the vaccines too. "I've had mine, have you had yours?" If you tell them no, or explain your concerns, you're putting doubt into their minds about their own decisions - they just want you to say you've done it too so they can feel more confident.</p>
<p>These people should have doubts in their mind, they've swallowed the "vaccine is safe and effective" without so much as even looking what it does/what it may do. </p>
<p>If you're confident you've done the right thing with the amount of information you've deemed to be convicing to you - then full respect, good luck, you'll need it.</p>

        <p>The world has been divided into two groups.  Vaccinated or non vaccinated.  It's not even about religion, politics, race, gender, creed.  It's whether you're vaccinated or not.  More fighting amongst ourselves across all categories.</p>
