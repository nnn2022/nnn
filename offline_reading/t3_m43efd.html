        <p>I don’t understand the level of cognitive dissonance you need to have to accept things like the RFID in your debit and credit card, all the tracking devices in your phone, your various social media accounts that track you (not just for advertising), and all other shit that creates a dossier on your every move (because remember corporations are in cahoots with govt). Especially funny that people think a mask is the pinnacle of governmental control while there’s literally face recognition tech that’s been in the works consistently for years and years the likes of a literal police state/ dictatorial dystopia. But yeah, a medical mask (which actually saw a massive decline in facial recognition technologies being able to see the same amount of work/advancing until China made a way to recognize masked people as well. If you don’t believe they already have the ability to fully control your life (hell, everything you do is composed of someone else convincing you of something you either take or don’t) then you’re lost. Makes sense that you all wanna feel like you possess a larger element of control, but ya don’t and won’t until the day you don’t exist. But really. A mask hahaha</p>
<p>Implying people are less educated while you follow a myriad of manipulative controls is just the goofiest thing ever. That high horse “sheep” shit looks so hilarious when otherwise smart people use it as a weapon to make invalid points about systematic controls (seemingly forgetting the much worse actual controls that prove we are heading into tyranny)</p>

        <p>You don’t have to mandate all things to use them on the populous while avoiding consent, or making consent an impossible option. Example: you don’t agree with the massive amount of surveillance this country does. So you could always leave to the woods, but that’s not a viable option for everyone. So you’re forced to partake in a society that is watching you at all times. You can’t just escape the control. And you certainly aren’t doing anything to escape said control by not wearing a mask, or being mad about a mandate while things that aren’t even mandated are being used all the same (but worse)</p>
<p>Essentially, where can you draw a line on what’s voluntary when you’re not the one volunteering yourself to the protocol? You’re being volunteered and most of the times under the guise of some other false premise. </p>
<p>In short, my original point is you’re trying to escape control simply based on it being mandated that you be controlled vs you “willingly” allowing the same system to infringe and manipulate you without even mandating it.</p>

        <p>So are all your responses to plenty of content just truncated ridiculously, or do you actually expound on the opinions you present?</p>
<p>I also wasn’t making up an argument for you. I was simply stating that it looks funny to be upset at being told what to do when it’s mandated, as opposed to when it isn’t (as you implied the mandate was what put the two subjects apart). </p>
<p>Calling out strawman is a nice skapegoat for not elaborating or trying to come to a conclusion instead of lending itself to a possible circular argument (itself a fallacy). Even if a strawman is presented. You never even initially had anything of value to add to my first remarks anyway. Just “but mandates”. </p>
<p>Anyway it’s whatever. Believe whatever you need to for your own mental health.</p>

<p>I never said a mandate was the same as something not mandated. Only that there are non-mandated activities partaken in all the time that have obscenely controlling and manipulatory over/undertones (depending on how well versed you are in seeing it). So what’s the point in being upset about being told what to do being a written mandate and you having to be told what to do outside of mandates? Does being upset about being controlled only hold meaning if it’s mandated? </p>
<p>Implying I am “far gone” just sounds like you’re taking the lazy mid-road so you don’t have to write a few paragraphs for a moment.</p>

<p>Worried about power being turned off use a propane generator.</p>
<p>Water being turned off make a well, keep gallons on you and collect rain water.</p>
<p>Phone there are ways to remove the spyware and you can just leave it if you're going to do something sketchy.</p>
<p>Paper trail pay in cash or look into crypto currency not Bitcoin perhaps monero or etherium.</p>
<p>Quite honestly besides my address I've got a answer to avoid most of the problems the government can implement covertly and there's probably a shell company trick I can use to avoid that. </p>

        <p>Lmao the fact that the government has enforced masks doesn’t inherently make them a bad thing. We would probably have flattened the curve, like Australia and New Zealand have, if everyone took it serious and gave a shit from the beginning, granted their governments also gave a shit and weren’t hyper focused on reopening bars and restaurants. the fact that some of you people can’t differentiate and critically think, but then call everyone else sheep is as sad as it is funny. Why wouldn’t you try to fight for a government that cares about you instead of rolling over and taking it and accepting the government is this infallible shitty thing in all our lives. Other governments paid their people to stay home and they aren’t in a pandemic anymore, weird huh?but ours do the bare minimum and all the sudden our freedoms are gone, jesus grow up</p>

        <p>Again things aren’t bad inherently just because the government backs them, are seatbelts bad? Is that another scam that leftist cucks have fell for?
Other countries don’t have Fauci or Biden to pin everything on, but those countries are done dealing with it, and used masks and social distancing,the same things they suggested. Not sure how you can explain that away. Also disagree with Fauci all you want, most the science and healthcare professionals are still on my side lmao I’ve lived a fulfilling life this past year and I’ve been careful about not infecting people it can be done, it just sucks that your so selfish your not willing to temporarily change the way you interact with the world to protect people. I think your wrong about the 99.98 survival rate but, even then your willing to let 1 percent die so you can go to Applebee’s or what the fuck ever? Do you know how many people 1% is?? Not to mention people who are immunocompromised don’t deserve death, that’s some eugenics type of shit. So really you haven’t disproven anything I’ve brought enough up, you just spat the exact talking points all you antimask/antivax dipshits always use</p>

        <p>Most the science seems to disagree homie, your holding on to some false shit. While masks aren’t 100% effective they do HELP in stopping the spread. That’s why the flu was a my a record low, never before have so many people been wearing masks in the US at once. Also if they don’t work then why are the countries that used them effectively going back to normal? Why is it the states with more lax mask laws that have the issue controlling it, but states that enforce it have been able to keep the spread down? You fuckers are so afraid of a new normal but the irony is you are the ones keeping us in this perpetual state of fucked up. We’re going to have to adjust forever to keep up with the virus that keeps mutating and getting stronger because people won’t take it seriously and it has more chances to mutate. You can’t win this one you are wrong and uneducated</p>

        <p>You really lost me when you mentioned Australia and New Zealand. I live in Brisbane, Queensland and we’re home to some of the most nonsensical legislation made into affect compared to other states and territories in the country.</p>
<p>This is all I’m going to say because if I detail every reason why our state politics (Annastacia Palaszczuk and her minion ministers) runs on pure condescending garbage even outside the topic of Covid-19, I could go for a long while and honestly it’s not worth my investigation. If I think too much about this bullshit I’ll get to the point where I feel so strong with what I disagree I become morally corrupt. Think Alex Jones, the real life J. Jonah Jameson.

        <p>LoL 🤣 great meme. Hear me out. The analogy is almost completely... Sheeples 🐏  imply these are mature adult creatures. I don't believe the people who have created a the problems lately are mature... Even mature sheep protect the young and innocent from harm. Ergo they are lambs not sheep.</p>

        <p>Okay? That’s not the point of the post. Is that all you people say? No one said it was hard to wear a mask. But it is hard to not be allowed to see my family, to catch up with my friends, to know that my grandma has been denied access into the NHS with lung cancer because of a virus with a 98% survival rate. It’s hard to be isolated. It’s hard knowing life may never be the same, and that people like you just accept it, cheer it in some cases. It’s hard losing everything you’ve ever known to be normal, and most of what makes an individual happy over something so totally not worth it.</p>
<p>But I’m sure you’ll say “Just wear a mask. Only a bit longer and then we’ll be out of it.” Yeah. Just two weeks to flatten the curve, right? Or has it been over a year? Wake up. This is a much bigger issue than simply wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Its hard to lose your job. Its hard to feed your kids. Its hard to find a new job with so many people in the same boat. Its hard to watch and wait for the moratorium on evictions to end knowing that the people who did this to you are the only ones keeping you in a home. Its hard to find someone to watch your kids for free so you can doordash food to the ivory towers these wretched people live in.</p>

        <p>Also did you not see my point about my grandma with cancer being denied access into hospital because of Covid? I guess you don’t care about my nan then. Grandma killer! As you people say lol.</p>
<p>Cancer is a much bigger killer than Covid, not to mention all of the other diseases that kill millions more than Covid each month. If you catch a virus from being in proximity of someone, that is your own fault. If I get Covid, I will take full responsibility that I must have not stayed away from someone or taken enough precaution. Use your modern privilege of being able to simply stay at home and order products online so you never have to leave if you’re that worried about it! Why should the fit and healthy have to stay at home when they have such a minuscule chance of dying and are likely to be asymptomatic. And what of the elderly who are the vulnerable ones, confined to their homes for the last few months or years of their lives rather than seeing family or friends?</p>
<p>It’s everybody’s individual choice to take the risk of going out and meeting others. That’s how it has been throughout history. If you’re that worried about Covid-19, you would take the precautions needed to stay at home and not contract it. If not, you shouldn’t be under house arrest regardless.</p>
<p>This is against basic freedoms.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll just gloss over this text though because it’s too much for you to read lol. Then call me selfish afterwards because literally nothing I said stuck. So...</p>
<p>TL;DR - I care about more than just 2% of the population.</p>

        <p>You're selfish because you are, not because I think you are.  Most likely it's related to you being largely uneducated and young.  As you grow older and hopefully pursue intelligence you will look back at this time in your life and laugh.  When you have a life worth living you simply don't chase conspiracy theories - you just don't have the time.  </p>
<p>I know you'll gloss over this because it's just too much for you to grasp and call me a an "NPC" as you people say lol (I love how you don't even realize that all of you calling everyone NPC's literally makes you an NPC)</p>
<p>TL;DR - Get help.  Go to school.  Get some actual friends.</p>

        <p>And you're NOT selfish for wanting everyone to remain masked and under house arrest because YOU think it's the right thing for them to do? If I were an "at risk" person, I would never, EVER think to demand that everyone in the world stay home, lose their job, get vaccines, and wear masks indefinitely just to protect me. THAT is the epitome of selfishness and entitlement - trying to control what other people do, whom they can see, what they can wear, where they can go, and what pharmaceuticals they must put into their bodies (the vaccine).</p>

        <p>I have a life worth living. I have a job I love (I can’t go to it rn because of lockdown, but it’s very fulfilling), I have a girlfriend I’ve been with for a long time now and we’ll be moving in a new place together soon, I made a ton of friends at work who I keep in regular contact with, I have a nice family and I started saving up quite a bit. My life revolves beyond ‘conspiracy theories’ believe it or not. I go on reddit maybe an hour or so a day, (a lot of that, not related to ‘theories’) but beyond that I just like to live my life. It’s very hard to live it to its full because of Covid, but certainly easier than those who are petrified to leave their house, lest they somehow kill a grandma, get told off or catch a flu-like virus.</p>
<p>(P.S. I never use the term NPC as I think it’s very overused, but seeing all your comments basically just trolling forums with the same “Wear a mask” and “You’re selfish” comments... it’s more fitting for you than anyone else I’ve seen so far on this site.)</p>
<p>I won’t say much more on this to you now. I know I won’t change your mind. Enjoy fearing the virus over the months and years to come. I might respond further if you have an actual argument besides “selfish” or just trying (and failing) to insult me. Til then, peace.</p>

        <p>Dude...  you realize people can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ebew54/a_bit_about_me_recently/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">read your post history right</a>?</p>
<p>"I just lost my job a few days ago because I’ve had to have time off work because they screwed up my back by not giving me any health and safety training and giving me constant heavy lifting for long shifts.</p>
<p>Because of this I’m on £300 a month, £200 of which I have to give to my mum. I hate getting money from the government, I want to work and I wanted to stay working in my previous job but I just couldn’t do it for any longer no matter how hard I tried.</p>
<p>I can’t drive yet but I have a car my dad gave me. It’s not road insured and the only place for it to stay is on my girlfriends family drive, now her dad doesn’t want it to stay there for longer so I’m going to have to sell the car which I will only get about £900 for.</p>
<p>I feel like my girlfriend is about to break up with me all the time and we’ve been together for almost 14 months but lately I’ve just not felt very loved and it’s making me really depressed more than anything else I’m mentioning here.</p>
<p>My family is more broken than ever.</p>
<p>My only sibling that I live with never speaks or comes out of his room. My mum is having to provide for us all with hardly enough money to do so. My dad (split with my mum years ago) is about to get divorced with my step mum.</p>
<p>I’m constantly paranoid and self-loathing and have no motivation or energy left in me. I’m not suicidal but I feel like the slightest thing could make me suicidal.</p>
<p>I just constantly feel worthless and don’t know what to do anymore"</p>
<p>Notice how much you lied in your original reply to me?  That should be a warning to you.  When you have to invent a life to hide your true life - you are doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Seriously, good luck to you.  You're clearly very young, obviously uneducated and you're in a bad place right now.  I hope you find the help you clearly need.</p>

        <p>Right? That was over a year ago?

<p>All your replies are either copy/paste buzzwords and slogans like “wear a mask”, or you resort to lowest-common-denominator tactics like trying to insult. Come back when you know how to argue. If not, this is my last reply to you. Unless there’s more replies before I haven’t seen yet. From now on, though that’s it unless you have a good argument. Not that I expect that to happen.</p>
<p>I’d have better luck finding a sharp enough point from a sphere than you.</p>

        <p>Ohhh I just checked your history too.  I had no idea you were just a shill.  It's sad seeing how your comments are just you regurgitating the talking points handed down to you from Fox News.  It's too bad people can't think for themselves anymore.  I also notice you constantly call everyone an NPC.  I imagine words like "irony" and "hypocrisy" are quite foreign to you?  It's pretty insane the amount of words you use that you don't understand the meaning of.</p>
<p>Listen, seriously, go back to school.  A GED is not that hard to achieve.  You'll thank me for it.</p>

        <p>Haha only just seen this comment, didn’t realise you made yet more useless commentary. I don’t even watch Fox News. Not even American, I’m British. I’m not even right-wing or political, since you like checking my post history, check the post where I talked about how politics is just a game recently for proof.</p>
<p>And I’m very used to words like that. Hypocrisy, for instance, applies to people like you, who call people like me “selfish” for not wanting 100% of the population to suffer for the 2%. It would be selfish of me, if I was vulnerable, to tell you you have to wear a mask, vaccinate yourself, not see your family or friends, not go to school, not go to work and not go abroad just for my ‘safety’.</p>
<p>I finished school, and college, got a job then got a much better job thanks. I won’t be going back to anywhere, except normality, because I’m not sticking by these clown principles.</p>

<p>Dudes. You’re on welfare and live with your mom.  Nobody, in any country, cares in any way what you have to say.</p>

        <p>I don’t live with my mum? You’re basing everything about my life from a post over a year ago. I live alone but am hoping to move in with my girlfriend very soon into a new place. I have a very strong relationship, a great group of friends and a good job. </p>
<p>I am 19 years old, but probably much happier and live a much more fulfilling life than you. And I still make better arguments than you.</p>
<p>I’m not on welfare. I can’t go to my job because of Covid restrictions, but I’m meant to be back next month, in the meantime I’ve been selling clothes on Depop and art and albums on Ebay for a large profit.</p>
<p>I am getting out, though, you don’t like people doing that from the sounds of it. You see, I’m one of the few not afraid of this virus and I actually like going out, seeing friends and living my life. I have empathy for others, just mine isn’t limited to the 2% of the population at risk. When the economy fails from lockdown measures, closed businesses, loss of jobs and people being unable to work at full capacity due to seriously damaged mental health, please tell me how much you cared about everyone then.</p>

        <p>You don’t need to declare your age, every word you type makes that clear.  When your entire life has been living with you parents and living off the government, your perspective is going to be skewed.</p>
<p>I understand your obsession with not being controlled, that’s all you know.  Your entire life has been living off other people - always having to do what they say.  It’s literally the most common reason people fall into the conspiracy trap.</p>
<p>Time will help you.  Taking care of yourself will also help you.  Honestly you seem intelligent enough, you just need time and success.  It will come for you I’m sure.</p>
<p>In the mean times I highly suggest you read this AMA.  It may really help you.</p>

        <p>Actually I do. I care about the 100% of people (in my country and everywhere else it’s in place) impacted by lockdown measures, restrictions and isolation. I care about the 2% of people who may die from Covid, however, I feel that the 98% shouldn’t have to suffer for the 2%. The 2% (almost entirely made up of the elderly and vulnerable) should stay at home until they’re fully vaccinated if they’re afraid of Covid illness or death.</p>
<p>You who I assume is most likely part of the 98%, taking the vaccines that still spreads Covid, will be spreading it to the elderly and vulnerable when you go into shops. You might wear a mask, but what about gloves? What about touching your phone which is full of your own germs and then touching groceries or products in the shops? By that logic, you’re selfish for putting them at risk. </p>
<p>I simply think if they’re that afraid of the virus, they should be the ones staying at home, why should the rest of us?</p>

        <p>So you think it’s ok that our children are losing out on a normal childhood? You think it’s ok that kids are now afraid to play with other kids at the playground is a good thing? Closing schools is ok? You think spending millions of dollars to surround desks with plexiglass is just? You think masking and isolating children is the right thing to do, in the most developmental years of their life? Teenagers not being able to have normal graduations, proms, athletics, after school jobs, etc. is ok? And for those that think that all of this is not ok or just “don’t care about other people.”</p>

        <p>That's right, the prime reason big bad rona is still flourishing and out of control is because there are millions and millions of mythical non mask-wearers that perpetually have covid and keep spreading it! </p>
<p>Almost like it has nothing to do with the fact that this is an extremely low IFR virus and that you can do nothing to stop a highly transmissible but relatively mild virus. That is just how mild respiratory viruses are...too contagious and too high a number of asymptomatics to stop, contain, or slow in any significant way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you are completely ignoring all the detrimental effects the past year has had on society. The economy is crashed, dozens of different sectors bankrupted (more deaths from starvation, suicide, overdoses), children lost a year of their education and social development at crucial stages in their lives, increased use of plastics, increased pollution, governments brazenly enacting dystopian hells overnight, millions of idiots brainwashed to be afraid of a mild virus... Half of people now believe this is a totally normal, sane, scientific response to a virus. They are irrationally afraid of respiratory viruses that humans have lived with (and thrived) for thousands of years.</p>

If the IFR is low it shows us how mild the virus is that the vast majority of people don't even really get sick from contracting it. If a billion people get a respiratory virus (the WHO confirmed 750 million have already been infected by covid 5 months ago), and only 1 or 2 million of them die...that shows what it is...a highly contagious but mild virus, like any other mild respiratory virus humans have dealt with since our existence. </p>
<p>You need to understand that covid doesn't "kill" people because it is especially harmful of a virus. Covid "kills" by being too much for someone with a very weak immune system to handle...just like any mild virus can and does do (hence why the vast majority of covid deaths are elderly who already passed their life expectancy). This is why there are warnings about taking immuno suppressing drugs, for example. There are viruses and bacteria that exist in the bodies of every single human and ones we come into contact with every single day. They are completely harmless for the average immune system. But when someone has a severely suppressed immune system, such harmless pathogens can cause death. </p>
<p>&rt;And all of those things governments done to prevent this ''mild virus'' was ofcourse ''unnecessary'' and had no impact on the viru </p>
<p>Most of the perscribed measures. Because highly contagious, mild respiratory viruses spread fast. No masks or lockdowns or social distancing or other voodoo is going stop them. This is why these measures have all completely failed. </p>
<p>Hand washing is the only thing that actually makes sense to reduce the spread of any pathogen. The only measure they've advocated for this respiratory virus that isn't medieval quackery. Hand washing is good as long as it isn't obsessive and excessive. </p>
<p>Almost everything concerning this virus is a massive break from all protocol and sanity. What has happened this March 2020 has <em>never</em> been the rational, scientific consensus in how to deal with a respiratory virus.</p>

        <p>Not "completely harmless". People of all ages can die from covid. The IFR simply differs for different age groups.
For example, for people over 75 yo the IFR is significantly higher and the virtually non-existent IFR for those under 30.
A 30 year-old literally has a higher chance of being struck by lightning than dying of covid. </p>
<p>Other than that, yes. The covid response is truly a massive psycho break from decades of established science, logic, and common sense. Why do you think there's never been a pandemic response like this one before?</p>
