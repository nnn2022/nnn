    <strong>Wuhangate/Fauci Conflict of Interest Quick Rundown (This is what they are trying to hide)</strong>
    <p><p>\&rt;Government funding programs via NIH, Pentagon, etc lead money to "conservation medicine" companies and scientists whom have had connections with each other for decades</p>
<p>\&rt;one in particular, EcoHealth (President Peter Daszak) has received tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars via PREDICT program funded by USAID (gov)</p>
<p>\&rt;EcoHealth then funds and works with the Wuhan Institute before covid, studying many things, among them bat coronavirus through an associate Chicom scientist Shi Zheng-li and other Gain of Function studies</p>
<p>\&rt;NIH (Fauci) also funded WIV directly</p>
<p>\&rt;whatever the "wuhanvirus" is happens</p>
<p>\&rt;some scientists release reports that this virus's spike protein is not natural, but modified by someone (some believe it was Shi Zheng-li)</p>
<p>\&rt;Daszak writes a paper with two other scientists deboonking WuhanLab theory</p>
<p>\&rt;other scientists related in the same business and scientific pursuits and funding as EcoHealth, such as Khristian Andersen, W. Ian Lipkin, and Shi Zheng-li also write to deboooonk Wuhan lab story, and they all source each other, all receiving much of the same funding.</p>
<p>\&rt;Fauci shows support for the Daszak and Lipkin-Andersen papers</p>
<p>\&rt;p1150 (out of 3234) of Fauci E-mails Batch 1 shows Daszak giving Fauci the 1000 thank-yous for "standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for Covid-19"</p>
<p>\&rt;Daszak joins the WHO Wuhan Commission to "find the origins of the virus" aka sweep evidence under the rug, as they find nothing</p>
<p>\&rt;Daszak joins the Lancet Magazine COVID-19 deboonking team</p>
<p>\&rt;MSM and big Tech deboonk with papers from Daszak and the others</p>
<p>\&rt;Everyone then repeats each other's sources that originated from conflicted-of-interest papers that it's deboonked</p>
<p>\&rt;Fast forward to now, Fauci said he didn't fund WIV, which we now know NIAID did and much more gov funding went there through EcoHealth</p>
<p>\&rt;3 Batches of Fauci E-mails drop this past week along with other documents showing direct collaboration between NIH/Fauci and Wuhan Lab "Deboonkers"</p></p>
