    <strong>College Students Are Willing to Accept The New Normal, And It's Disturbing</strong>
    <p><p>I go to UC Riverside in California. They've just announced that classes will have to be approved for in-person instruction. The school will most likely focus on labs, studios, and performing art classes. The rest online. Tuition is $5K per quarter. </p>
<p>And students in my subreddit are happy with it. They embrace wasting money, taking out loans, going into debt to sit in their room and look at a computer for an "education". </p>
<p>But it's not just Fall, they believe they'll be online Winter and Spring. Or until there is a vaccine. It's upsetting that they think like this, and just accept that they will not get any resources, work on campus, meet new people, and engage in extracurriculars. I have tried to reason with these people and say that universities cant be online for an entire year, but they don't care. They believe the only solution is a vaccine. Just like most doomers and the idiots who watch CNN. </p>
<p>If you're in or going to college, do anything you can to make sure you stop students from accepting a new normal and become human again. We cannot be deprived and robbed of a livelihood anymore, and accepting it is psychotic. Fight back against the doomers and lame trolls who are hopeless on both social media and in real-life. In addition, do anything you can to make sure you have a good experience. One you're willing to invest money into. Don't let the doomer students or scared administration get in the way. We have to do something.</p></p>

        <p>I want to go back to college to get a nursing degree but there is no way in hell I’m going to pay full price for a half assed computer based education. Full capacity, no mask or I’ll find something else to do. I hope colleges fail for the poor product they expect people to pay sticker price for. Maybe once that happens enough or there’s such a drop in enrollment, colleges go bankrupt and tuition won’t cost as much as a house for a four year degree.</p>

        <p>As someone who went to college (for a useful degree in my field), while the piece of paper I earned gave me the paper credentials to get  a good job, I use absolutely nothing from college in my job, almost everything I use daily at my job is learned from experience.</p>
<p>College in 90% of cases is completely useless for the desired field, but the braindead HR departments of the world require it.</p>

        <p>I went to college as an adult mainly because I needed a couple years off work so I decided to go get an associates degree at a good Community College. A lot of the classes for a joke. Luckily I was going for a stem degree and most of those were good and challenging, mainly computer science and math classes. But I had to take a few arts and humanities type credits while I was there and let me tell you it was like going to a middle school class how immature the content was and those things were like Easy A's. There was no challenge whatsoever in my Arts and Humanities classes</p>

        <p>Oh, but I did. Witness the stupidity firsthand. Honestly, my field of study didn't require the institution like other careers (e.g. STEM fields), and I lucked out tuition-wise thanks to scholarships. For a great many, however, college is nothing more than ideology camp with a dash of debt slavery to boot, and thus I disrespect.</p>

        <p>When I was in college around 2008-ish, I had a couple online classes and I learned ZERO from those. Basically paid attention enough to pass and that is it. I kinda feel like most people in charge know this, and it's kind of a way to dumb down society with the veil that they are still receiving an education.</p>

        <p>What’s worse is in a way many are almost forced to do this. Some colleges are making it almost impossible to defer, so the gap year might not be an option without losing your scholarship. Plus there’s not a lot of places to travel, and finding a job will be very difficult.  So for many taking it might feel like the only option.</p>

        <p>It's hard to tell if it's social media/ reddit echo chamber or if large percentages of people in the real world really are willing to live in a hole indefinitely.</p>
<p>I received a survey from the archdiocese yesterday and a series of questions gave different scenarios and asked under which we would leave for public school. I made it clear anything short of full in classroom we would move, because it's just not worth paying tuition.</p>
<p>Those in college are really in a bind because as others say it's not as easy as dropping out or taking a gap year. For many people that degree will be their livelihood. I hate to think these institutions have figured out they can charge the same tuition but offer a degree at lower base cost, and sit on the profits.</p>
<p>Reading between the lines of the catholic school survey they are either terrified of losing huge numbers of students, or considering full classroom learning as an incentive to lure kids from public school (which at the moment looks like it will be staggered day/ hybrid or fully online). Maybe the same will be done by colleges offering the full on campus experience as an incentive to enroll students.</p>

        <p>That's the scary thing. I'm worried that this is really how students feel. That's why I left my subreddit page, as it was giving me so much anxiety and I couldn't tolerate what they were saying about the entire year, and couldn't care less about ruining their lives/futures.</p>

        <p>The fact that all these young people have been made to believe that this virus poses ay real danger to them is absolutely maddening and really shows how easily the masses can be manipulated, gaslighted, and made to accept lies and psychosis as truth and normality.</p>

        <p>My college sent out a survey a month or so ago about how we thought they handled the covid situation. It was an anonymous survey, so I bluffed and told them I would be dropping out or deferring if they did something as ridiculous as Zoom university in the fall. </p>
<p>In reality, deferring at my school is very difficult and I don’t really have the resources to wait to start my master’s program, especially after losing my job this month. I will just have to go for it no matter what happens. But we will see if more students feel the same way that I do. They will tell us the plan at the beginning of July. </p>
<p>Masks aren’t required on campus right now (you can still go to a few buildings on campus to study, which is what I’m spending my weekdays doing) or if they are, it isn’t enforced, so I will continue not wearing mine.</p>

        <p>I'm in my last semester of Uni thank god. So come next year I'll be getting paid, not paying for something I'm not getting. I think this one single semester of that shit is enough and wouldn't fancy doing it over next year. So I"m grateful my bachelors is int he bag. I already wasn't planning on doing a masters right away, now I'm sure.I wont be getting a Graduation ceremony but at this point I'm gonna just take what I can get and run with it in the opposite direction of whatever they are doing. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As long as they let me complete my teaching degree this semester I'm a happy camper and come next year I might still be teaching digitally, which is far from ideal,  but at least I'll be getting paid wages to do it, not paying ridiculous tuition. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now if only this program could give me clarity on whether or not the school is gonna give me my diploma or not. At this point it's unclear if, however hard we work or study, the school is gonna be willing to let us graduate. It might be out of my hands. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But it they try to fuck me over I'm gonna raise hell for them. So they'd best not do that.</p>

        <p>Reddit =/= real life. SO MANY people on Reddit I have seen unironically like the lockdown because they are antisocial and don't like the "demands" of social life and would prefer to keep it compartmentalized online. Also, Reddit is a toxic hivemind with NO tolerance for dissent. Some have even called it more dangerous than even Twitter in this regard.</p>

<p>I thought university was supposed to be expensive here!</p>
<p>Your colleagues are idiots though. This entire time they had everything they needed to distance-learn all the content in all of their classes <em><strong>without paying a dime</strong></em>.

        <p>It’s $15K, as each quarter (3 terms) is $5K. It’s cheaper than a lot of universities, since it’s in-state. </p>
<p>And idk if it’s a majority of my school, or the people on social media/Reddit. It’s just sickening and depressing to hear that shit. So much money for a God Awful experience? GTFOH.</p>
