    <strong>Are the people that we trust actually lying to us?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm starting to wonder if the people I am close to are actually just lying to me? For example, we have had one person in our company "die of Covid". There was a funeral and everything, although I wasn't invited (which aroused my suspicions). But trusted colleagues told me they went and I believed them. But it wasn't open-casket (more suspicions), and when I asked if anybody had actually seen his dead body, they all looked a bit shifty, like they were uncomfortable with the question.</p>
<p>This was a couple of months ago; and today I could swear I saw this "dead" colleague in town. There aren't many other black people in the town, so I noticed this one at a couple of hundred yards' distance. I couldn't quite make out his face, but most of the features were the same, similar short hair, and black skin of course.</p>
<p>I mentioned this to my colleagues and they all looked at each other and seemed uncomfortable again, and one of them played the race card on me. They are typical establishment sheep who think that 9/11 was real and Obama is a citizen and Nixon did nothing wrong. They wouldn't recognise a government conspiracy if it shot them in the face.</p>
<p>So who do I know I can trust now that I know a man's death was faked?</p></p>

        <p>They looked "shifty eyed", which was likely side eye, because you are very inappropriate and being insulting.</p>

        <p>This is a pretty weak troll.</p>
<p>The UK is one of the most vaccinated places on earth. How much longer do you feel the government's enhanced powers should last? At what point will you think it may be wise to question it?</p>

        <p>You posted this to prove how smart you are. If folks had fallen for it, you would have deemed this as proof of your intelligence. And yet, I bet you haven't taken the results to mean you are not very bright, have you?</p>
