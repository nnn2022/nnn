    <strong>What are some combacks to someone who says the deaths are being significantly undercounted?</strong>
    <p><p>Pro lock down people are saying this after WHO's estimate of 750 million already having had the virus which sets the IFR at common flu levels. They're saying the excess deaths in the UK are ALL COVID deaths, and the excess people dying in homes in the UK from reasons other than COVID ''all died from COVID''</p></p>

        <p>People continue to look for ways to respond to the pro-lockdown crowd, in hopes of changing their minds. The sad fact is that there is no silver bullet here. A lot of people are just set in their ways. No specific comeback or data or other response will get them to change their minds. It's like trying to force someone to change their religion, it's not going to happen (and yes, COVID hysteria is a cult/religion now, as people point out here). </p>
<p>Only they can change themselves. There's plenty of information floating around on the internet, including here, at LDS, and other news outlets online. </p>
<p>At this point, our group needs to pass more information around in real life, to those who may be sitting on the fence. Believe me, it seems to be easier to have an actual conversation offline since those on the fence may be more open to being educated. Even then, there will be plenty of people who will also refuse to budge.</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right. I don't waste my time with the full on doomer crowd. They won't listen no matter what you say. The irl on the fence crowd is often way more open minded. I only talk about it to people who want to have a discussion about it. I think trying to persuade the doomer crowd is like trying to tell an avid Trump supporter to vote for Biden or vise versa. It just doesn't work.</p>

        <p>Er, simply ask them for evidence of their claims. If their evidence is strong and credible... they might be right.</p>
<p>But, as I highly suspect will actually be the case, if they have no evidence - or what they have is weak and <em>in</em>credible - then I encourage you to call them a moron.</p>
<p>You can't argue a negative, so don't even try. It's not your duty to do so. It is <em>their</em> duty to convincingly argue <em>their</em> case. If they don't, you are free to ignore them.</p>

        <p>Today I had a discussion on the science sub reddit w/ a doomer who insisted that the Rt of covid was close to 8. When clearly, it is not. I sent links, but I don’t think he understands. 
(Which, to be fair, I am not a numbers person either.) 
I think he is confusing it with percent % for his area or something.</p>
<p>He did, however understand that the rt number was indicative of how many people an infected person potentially infects.</p>
<p>So in cases like this, for online discussions, I will sometimes take the time to explain the eeror and reasoning. </p>
<p>Even if the OP gets argumentative, you never know who else may be reading and learn something.</p>

        <p>I'd use the good old: "that's quite lot of deaths. Better contribute in flattening the curve by washing my hand and staying home if i feel ill, since it is a common courtecy to be considerate towards others."</p>
<p>That'll ought to shut em up.</p>
