    <strong>Is anybody else worried about the future?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure most of you will say yes but the things going on in this wolrd are becoming exceedingly ridiculous. I'm 19 and just heard about the World Economic Forum statement about their plans in 2030. If you haven't heard their idea is that we are dumbasses who don't know how to be independent human beings so their plan is to treat us like we're still little babies, relying completely on the government and the wealthy elite. It seems to me we are already in a dystopia and there is no turning back from here. We've got an immense amount of censorship on all social media platforms, everyone is the next Jesus and took the vaccine for my fucking sins, there is a completely manufactured and over-glorified idea that racism still is prevalent in this country (I'm "black" btw), and finally the fact that people shrug off what your saying because your a conspiracy theorist, a nazi, or an anti-vaxxer. I just want to say I am very scared for what is to come of humanity in the future, it seems our road has already been paved for us.</p>
<p>I'll leave you guys with a quote that has stuck with me for awhile now, "THE ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS". Fuck these virtue signaling, face diaper wearing, Dr. Fauci sucking bitches man.</p></p>

        <p>Nice to see someone as young as you aware of what’s going on. It gives my crusty old 30-something ass some hope. (Kinda kidding, I actually feel young af but that’s beside the point.)</p>
<p>I will challenge you on one thing, though: I don’t think the road to hell is paved with good intentions in this situation. I think they know exactly what they’re doing and want to drag us all down there as fast as possible.</p>

        <p>Even though the quote was used for a different reason I feel that it fits, but I will agree that they are extremely ignorant and not even the slightest bit observant of what is happening. The full quote is "The road to hell is paved with good intentions, but the road to heaven is paved with good action". I feel like the first half of this quote could be taken in a different context. For example the people who are taking the vaccine are saying that it's for the best of society and other people (good intentions), that the "anti-vaxxers" are the one's that are killing everyone and that we're so ignorant and dumb for not taking the vaccine. This is how politicians mask their authoritarianism, they claim that what they're doing is for the benefit of world and society (good intentions), and that everyone who doesn't follow them is basically single-handedly causing the virus. I hope I explained it well.</p>
<p>P.s. I love your name, made me laugh a lil.</p>

<p>And yes, when I pay too much attention to what's going on in the world. I get extremely concerned for the future.</p>

        <p>21 year old woman here and the past year has been the biggest redpill in my life. I can no longer see the world the same way again. I am increasingly trying to do things like learn self-sustainability and make switches to encrypted independent tech with how the world is headed further into a surveillance state shitter.</p>
