    <strong>Reflections of 2020...</strong>
    <p><p>I live in the suburbs of Washington DC. I'm in an essential role and have been out and about for my job every day since the beginning of this nonsense. My fianc√© and I have been on multiple trips, once to the gulf coast beaches of Florida in May and most recently to Busch Gardens for the Christmas celebration where my kids and I rode roller coasters until I literally puked (no lines!). Last night we had a nice NYE dinner out at a nice restaurant. Occasionally we need to mask up to comply with businesses and blend in with the doomers, but it's been normal life other than that. One big perk has been much less traffic around here while the the rest cower away at home. </p>
<p>My point is, we have been living life in spite of this virus. At some point when more people have had enough of being controlled the populous will force the government to roll back their position. I feel for anyone displaced by the shutdowns but people need to just live their lives. The news and paranoid shamers are all just background noise you can choose to ignore. </p>
<p>I hope everyone decides to reclaim their lives. Cheers to a prosperous 2021.</p></p>

        <p>Take it up a notch on the 6th of January. That day is for anyone who loves his country despite racial religious or political differences. Let's make a last stand come 6th. We are running out of time.</p>
