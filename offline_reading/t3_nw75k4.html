<p>I'm healthy and young enough that this isn't a concern to me.</p>
<p>But inject something foreign directly into my blood? Something not even FDA approved? ("emergency use only") Made by vaccine manufacturers with no liability? With the kind of side effects that are happening to people?</p>

        <p>It's not just about you. It's about all the people you'll carry the virus to if you catch it. Even asymptomatic and totally safe, you're a walking infection vector that can pass the virus on to your family, friends, colleagues, and passers-by in the street. If you can honestly say that there isn't a single person you're going to come within twenty feet of from now until this pandemic is over who you wouldn't feel the least bit guilty for giving the virus to, then sure, you may not benefit from the vaccine. Otherwise, just think about who you'd be protecting.</p>

        <p>No, but when one in ten people in the country have been infected, the odds of you passing at least one infected person in the street are fairly good, particularly when one in four infected people don't feel or show any signs of it at all (but are still just as contagious). If that person decided not to wear a mask, then yes, they're exposing everyone around them to the virus. Studies have shown that even ordinary breathing and talking can spread aerosolised droplets up to 25ft, and in poorly-ventilated areas the virus can linger like that for 12-16 hours. A mask cuts this <em>way</em> down.</p>

        <p>Way more than one in ten have been exposed at this point. The safest thing if you're worried about everyone around you being a vector is for you to wear one of those N95 masks to protect yourself, and let others go about their business.</p>

        <p>Sure, there are masks that you can wear to protect yourself, but it's <em>more</em> effective if the other party is wearing a mask as well - and particularly if the infected person is masked, because that one mask then reduces the amount of infectious material that everyone else's masks have to deal with. This also protects anyone who has a legitimate reason why they can't wear a mask, or whose mask slips, or who takes their mask off to eat, or who carries that infectious material into their homes where they then go about unmasked.</p>
<p>You're still missing the point I'm trying to make: wearing a mask is not only to protect yourself from everyone else, but also to protect everyone else from yourself if you happen to be infected without knowing it. It's not "worrying about everyone around you being a vector", it's worrying about <em>you</em> being a vector and everyone around you being potentially vulnerable. Saying "there's no point in me wearing a mask because the virus won't hurt me" is to say that you only care about the virus' effects on yourself - that the wellbeing, the safety, and potentially the <em>lives</em> of those around you are less important to you than your own personal inconvenience of having to wear a mask.</p>

<p>Seeing other human beings as vectors of disease* seems like a truly horrible way to live your life. If you'd like to do that, go for it. I don't want to do that. I think the cost to society and to our young people in particular is huge, and I don't want to participate in that harm.</p>

<p>*if the Bubonic plague were in circulation I would happily take appropriate measures. I was fine doing the "two weeks to flatten the curve thing" while we got a handle on what Covid was all about. Now that we have so many appropriate measures for this particular virus - Ivermectin, vitamin D, overall health, reasonable use of ventilators, vaccines for anyone who wants them - I don't see any reason to continue to live in a state of fear or guilt.</p>

<p>&rt; Seeing other human beings as vectors of disease* seems like a truly horrible way to live your life.</p>
<p>It's not fun, I'll give you that; it's kinda scary and kinda depressing, but with one in ten infected, it's also not inaccurate right now. But, as I said, you're missing my point. <strong>Protecting yourself is not the only reason to wear a mask and get vaccinated.</strong> I personally didn't get vaccinated because I'm scared of all the people who might infect me. I got vaccinated because I don't want to pass the virus to my baby son, who is too young for a vaccine and might suffer lifelong consequences from it even if he comes through ok. I did it because I don't want to pass the virus to my elderly family, some of whom are immunocompromised and some of whom have heart and/or lung conditions that mean that coronavirus would likely be a death sentence for them. I did it because I don't want to pass the virus to my friends, who have young children and vulnerable family of their own. I did because I don't want to pass the virus to people in the street, who may have any number of reasons that they can't have the vaccine, or can't wear masks, or are particularly vulnerable. Putting my own discomfort at wearing a mask, or having the side effects (which, for what it's worth, were barely noticeable for me; mild chills that evening and a sore arm the morning after but that was about it) above the welfare of all those people? <em>That</em> seems like a pretty horrible way to live my life too.</p>

<p>I'm not missing your point, and putting in bold doesn't help; I genuinely don't think most of these measures are in the best interests of our young people in particular. However, I fully support your right to get the vaccine for whatever reasons you think are important. I also support the rights of those who look at the facts and make different decisions.</p>
<p>Those of us who are looking at the CDC data and the data from lockdown vs not lockdown areas are coming to different conclusions about the best course of action. You seem to think there's something inherently selfish about that.</p>

        <p>Ok, fair, I missed that it was a different person replying. The comment I was originally replying to did say that.</p>
<p>I <em>am</em> looking at the data. I'm looking at the studies, I'm looking at the difference in the curve before and after mask mandates, and in areas that made masks compulsory vs. merely advised. I'm also listening to the scientists who have way more qualifications in this area than me to actually interpret that data.</p>
<p>And yes, I think that rejecting the informed opinion of those more qualified than yourself to understand the science is foolish, and rejecting a measure intended to protect others because it doesn't benefit you personally <em>is</em> selfish.</p>

        <p>&rt;rejecting a measure intended to protect others because it doesn't benefit you personally is selfish.</p>
<p>So you're being selfish because you're supporting measures that you think protect your family but seem to be seriously affecting the mental health of a generation of young people? Are you being selfish in disagreeing with Kuldorff (or Bhattacharya, or Mullis, or... it's a long list), who are all likely way more qualified than you are in this area?</p>
<p>I actually don't think you are being selfish. I think you're doing the best you can in a sucky situation with limited data. That's what all of us are doing, and we're just not all reaching the same conclusions.</p>
<p>There are MANY experts and they do not all agree with each other. I'm cautious now in who I follow. I don't need a science degree to look at their past actions and their funding sources and then apply basic common sense as to whether they're worth my trust.</p>

        <p>&rt; I actually don't think you are being selfish. I think you're doing the best you can in a sucky situation with limited data. That's what all of us are doing, and we're just not all reaching the same conclusions.</p>
<p>I get this, and to be fair out of all the <em>many</em> conversations I've had about this, you're one of only three or four who have sounded any kind of reasonable about it. Most by this point in the discussion were practically foaming at the mouth and claiming I'd been brainwashed into paving the way for some Orwellian new world order. Look at my post history; you'll see I'm the first to speak out for privacy and personal freedoms when I think there's a legitimate threat; I would <em>not</em> be going along with any of this if I didn't think it genuinely helped.</p>
<p>I have friends and family who work in hospitals, or are paramedics, or who work in schools. I've seen and heard enough from them to convince me that what the news was reporting about the conditions in those places was not too far from the truth. Of course sensationalised here and there, but with a core of fact. (It might help that I'm careful about where I get my news from, so many of the crazier stories on both ends of the spectrum didn't reach me, or were ignored.) Between my own understanding of science and what I've been told by those people I know who work or have previously worked in medicine (both in frontline medical research and in labs developing medication and vaccines) I can follow the gist of the data that's being published. The conclusion I've reached is that I wanted to get vaccinated. I decided that I would avoid some of the vaccines when reports of their negative effects started to become credible (for full disclosure, I initially criticised some of those reports, but took notice later as more information became available) and in fact, by the time I got my vaccine, one of the ones I was planning to avoid was no longer being offered anyway...</p>
<p>Do I think the vaccine is 100% safe and trustworthy? No, probably not; I'd be surprised if there's any medication out there that has never caused an adverse reaction, and I'm pretty sure there are plenty of things that later get withdrawn as unintended effects are found. So why did I have the vaccination? Because, from the data I can see and trust, I think it's <em>mostly</em> safe (or to put it another way, I think that if it's safe enough to obtain the certification that it's been given, then it's safe enough for me) and I still think that its benefits outweigh the damage caused by its side effects and the damage caused by actually catching COVID and potentially passing it to someone else in my life.</p>
<p>I respect your right to make your own decision, <em>if</em> it's being done sensibly and without rejecting the science for no good reason. There's an important distinction between an informed decision that I happen to disagree with, and a decision based on arrogance or ignorance or selfishness. If you're happy that you're on the right side of that line, and you're happy to accept the same about me, then I have no quarrel with you.</p>

        <p>Likewise! Honestly, if more people in the world could discuss this in good faith like this, we'd be in much less of a mess right now. Pandemic or no, there's no room for dogma on either side of the argument. Honesty and critical thinking are in short supply.</p>

        <p>&rt;didnt even know i had it, thought it was a slight cough</p>
<p>That's just you personally, doesn't necessarily apply to everyone who gets COVID, you're a relatively healthy individual with a good immune system.</p>
<p>&rt;also, riddle me this my guy, why in the fuck when im evidently immune to it and have the anti-bodies to fight it do people demand i still get vaccinated against something i can already defend against?</p>
<p>The antibodies you have in your body are the part of your innate immune system, they're not specific to any micro-organism. You need antibodies that will specifically work against COVID, and the vaccine is a formulation designed to initiate that particular immunity in your body.</p>

        <p>Yes, for some vaccines that is true, the immunity generated by a vaccine <em>is</em> better than the one set up by the disease outset itself.</p>

        <p>That's interesting but it's a short study and we don't even begin to have the studies that show this long term for any of the Covid vaccines. If you want to get the vaccine even having had Covid, go for it. It doesn't make any sense to mandate it.</p>

        <p>Congratulations, you had a mild case. Having fought it off, you <em>may</em> now have some kind of immunity. Your immune system has mechanisms to fight off intruders in a generic fashion, and far more effective ones that rely on recognising the specific type of intruder. Without blood tests, we don't know whether your body began to recognise the coronavirus and produce targeted antibodies, or whether you just got lucky and due to a weak strain of the virus and/or a very low initial viral load from however you got exposed, your immune system was able to kill it off without needing a tailored response.</p>
<p>If it's the latter, then your body still can't recognise the coronavirus, and the vaccine would give it that ability. If it's the former, then the vaccine <em>may</em> not be necessary for you, but it still might strengthen your immune response by getting your body to produce antibodies in greater number and/or antibodies that work on different strains to the one you caught. In either case, this would allow you to so that you can more effectively fight off an infection if you get exposed to one of the nastier strains and/or with a higher initial exposure than what you had first time around.</p>
<p>The other consideration is that even though you had a mild case, not everyone is as lucky. While you were walking around, infected and unaware, everyone you came into close proximity with risked being exposed to the virus. Their immune systems might have been weaker than yours, they might have been exposed to a higher viral load than you, and they might have had underlying conditions that you don't have. This is the other reason for wearing a mask: it catches the aerosolised droplets that you breathe out, and stops them from reaching other people. Even a simple cloth mask will stop <em>some</em> of those droplets, and reduce the exposure of anyone breathing the same air as you, giving them a better chance to avoid catching it, or at least have a mild case. Hell, you may owe your good luck in only getting a mild case to the fact that someone <em>else</em> wore a mask and therefore reduced the amount of virus-laden droplets you inhaled when you were close to them.</p>

        <p>i wear a mask and dont vote republican i dont know what the fuck you seem to think of me but i can assure you its not true. im not taking the vaccine because i think this ones sketch as fuck and i hate how we unvaccinated are treated and all this passport shit, that alone is causing me to not take it out of protest.</p>
<p>Also, no im not a threat with my presence, that would require i know or it can be seen or perceived that im an active threat. my mere existence isnt threatening anyone. if i had corona and actively went out to cough in someones face, THATS a threat. if i feel absolutely fine and go grocery shopping, No, im not threatening ANYONE at all.</p>
<p>an invisible "but it might happen" is a shit justification. with that justification i could lock you up for life because idk you MIGHT stab me, do i know if you want to? no. Do you even have a knife? Irrelevant because you MIGHT and apparently thats enough.</p>

        <p>You can still catch COVID after getting the vaccine, no one said you wouldn't, you'd never hear that from a scientific source. It reduces mortality and the severity of your symptoms.
And side effects are nothing but your immune system responding to something new in your bloodstream, having side effects means that you have a working immune system, not that the vaccine is killing you.</p>

        <p>How could the vaccine be killing me? Any scientific evidence to back that up? </p>
<p>And no, as far as the COVID vaccine is concerned, the side effect IS the response of your immune systems. That's how a lot of vaccines work, you inject a weakened mix of the virus/bacteria into your body so it can't initiate the disease, but it's sufficient for your body to set up a specific defence against it.</p>

        <p>You don't need to tell me mice and humans are different. Our blood brain barriers are similar. That's the point of animals trials. If we were so different, they'd be pointless.</p>

<p>My point is that these mRNA jabs sometimes cause your body to misidentify healthy cells or proteins as dangerous. This results in your immune attacking your own body. Yes, side effects are a result of your immune in action. And yes, that can also be a problem that ends in death.</p>

        <p>You responded within 2 minutes of my previous comment. You're obviously uninterested in the evidence. You did not read the source I provided. It seems you have your mind set and are just here to argue. I wish you the best, and I truly hope that if you or your family have received the jabs (or will in the future), that you have no adverse effects.</p>

        <p>I went through your article, and I understand the point you're trying to make. LNPs can act in the way the article points out, but no such instances have been reported, and this is a hypothetical situation only. Curb your "uninterested in the evidence" crap. </p>
<p>And yes, me and my family have received the vaccinations, with varying degrees of side effects. But two days of discomfort at the max is acceptable when it compared to being infected and possibly having syptoms, especially for people with co-morbidities and such.</p>
