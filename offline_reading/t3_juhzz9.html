        <p>Treating adults like children or more appropriately just implying adults are too dumb to make their own personal decisions is not freedom. There is no such thing as freedom with censoring. They wouldn't censor anything if they had nothing to hide. There is no such thing as freedom without choice. I'm more afraid of the vaccine than the virus and I would gladly agree not to go to the hospital or ever seek medical attention for covid-19 to be absolved of the requirement to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>As you can see they do know vaccines don't work therefore the next step is to replace facts with brainwashing and fearmongering and of course enforce drugging.</p>
<p>Opioids, vaccines, drugs in general that's the way they care about your health (see obesity too). Oh yea and gyms, spas, sports/entertainment events are unhealthy and should stay closed. Drugstores is a good replacement, if you can purchase drugs what can you purchase.</p>
<p><em>The digital secretary, Oliver Dowden, said that “Covid disinformation is  dangerous and could cost lives”, and that there was "much more that can  be done" to counter it.</em> </p>
<p>Yeah what I said above has nothing to do with reality mr secretary. I wonder what kind of drugs he's on claiming such bull.</p>

        <p>Well, let's be honest, who didn't see this one coming? What with Big Brother deciding that we have to be "protected" from mean words (saying "let's go beat up/rape/murder these Xs at Y because Z," is contrary to popular belief, already a crime), it's a logical next step.</p>

        <p>Too many still don't see it coming or even believe it's already happening. That's what has scared me for over 8 months. What do you do when nobody listens? Once everyone is too afraid of speaking up because they are relying on the government to survive it's too fucking late. I screamed this in the beginning but nobody gave a shit because unemployment paid more for doing nothing than working did. Fuck the world of morons, I've got me and mine squared away and not sharing shit. I've got guns, gold, and crypto so I wish everyone the best but don't come asking for shit.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Honestly, that's all you can do, my brother/sister. How much time do you really have to explain to the tHiS sHiP iS uNsInKaBlE morons on the Titanic before you put yourself in danger?</p>
