    <strong>This sub is really interesting to me (in a good way)</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I’m a 18f who made the choice not to get the covid vaccine just because I think the risk of me getting the vaccine is higher then my chances of dealing with covid.</p>
<p>That being said, I still wear a mask in super crowded paces and don’t really go out a ton, I’m an introvert and don’t really “enjoy” crowded places. I respect and understand why we were locked down.</p>
<p>That being said, recently I’ve found myself extremely annoyed and upset surrounding the vaccine. My favorite hairdresser just announced that they won’t allow anyone unvaccinated to come there. This made me very upset. How does this affect anyone? Me being unvaccinated has NOTHING to do with her. </p>
<p>I’m also concerned about how much people are pushing this. Being denied into places because I don’t want to put a vaccine into me is scary to think about.</p>
<p>In fact I stated lying or making excuses to my close friends. I’m left leaning but yet have been called “conservative” and selfish by a lot of my close friends.</p>
<p>I hate how controversial the vaccine has become and i’m so frustrated about how I should hide the fact I made the informed choice to not get the vaccine.</p>
<p>I came onto this sub because no one else or other sub would understand.</p>
<p>End of rant &lt;</p></p>

        <p>I can relate to that as well. I need to choose who I talk to about the vaxx topic or I get judged, called anti-science and conspiracy theorist. Makes me cherish people with boundaries, and a more laissez-faire attitude.</p>

        <p>Humans are herd animals. They want to follow the crowd and get mad when you refuse to do the same. 
Mark Twain said: ‘Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.’</p>
<p>Keep note of how your ‘friends’ treat you and recognize they value ‘fitting in’ over your preferences. </p>
<p>This vaccine is still unapproved, untested and has already caused a lot of people a lot of damage and that’s just those reported to VAERS.
Lefties are evil. They lie and pressure people into agreeing with them. Hopefully this wakes you up to even more</p>

        <p>For over a year we have been told that even if you're not sick you should pretend that you are.  During that time, for many months, we were told to disinfect surfaces, which people did to the extreme, which we now know was basically pointless.  Now we are being told that unless we take an experimental vaccine then the one the other guy took doesn't work.</p>
<p>Just a very few of the reasons I think we should be skeptical.</p>

        <p>It's normal to be scared and disappointed that it will change your normal life routines for a bit. No biggie. Find another place to get your hair cut temporarily. They won't have that policy forever. You will be inconvenienced temporarily. Yes it sucks but we all are dealing with these things. I'm proud of you for thinking for yourself. Don't let fear or bullying make you do something you don't want to. Trust your gut. Scare tactics are temporary. Might last a few weeks or months but they will go away. If you have to lie then lie. Stay strong. This will pass.      Also I'm in my 30's so I have confidence from life experience to not care what others think. I realize it's much harder for younger people. But you can do it. I have faith in your strength. 🙂</p>

        <p>The thing is i’m not making “friends” I just wanted to hear some people’s thoughts on this.
I’m not dumb or brainwashed and I believe COVID is real and serious which kinda sets me apart from some people on this sub. 
I’m definitely not looking for validation and in fact have kinda been attacked because I said I wear a mask and get the lockdown.</p>

        <p>That’s not true though. Look at other countries where masks are normalized.
Being out in nature, interacting with humans, and just leaving your house helps your immune system. Even taking vitamin C and other things do too.</p>

        <p>Hey, if you want to wear a mask, go for it. I don’t think it’s necessary but As long as you don’t expect other people to I respect your decision.</p>
<p>I used to live and work in the international district of a college town so I would occasionally see Asian students wearing masks. It doesn’t bother me any more now than it did then, which is not at all. As long as it’s not a societal expectation people should do whatever they want</p>

<p>All that being said. Definitely trust your intuition about the vaccine.</p>

        <p>You saying you “respect and understand why we were locked down” is the exact reason why the hairdressers aren’t letting unvaccinated people in. This is so important to understand the connection between fear and compliance. The lockdowns are just as unnecessary as the vaccines. </p>
<p>The lockdowns put small businesses in an incredibly difficult situation of constantly shutting down, then being “allowed” to reopen only to be shut down again. Unfortunately industries such as hair have been the hardest hit. The hairdresser may simply be applying the strongest stance in a sad attempt (plea) to stay open. Its a form of coercion placed on them too. They may be traumatized over this whole experience and (naively) believe if they comply properly they won’t get shut down again. </p>
<p>With that being said, I am a hairdresser that was forced into closing my salon last year because of all this nonsense. It absolutely disgusts me that people are afraid of other people, and treat others like walking vessels of disease, especially in an industry such as mine where we are so close to people, physically and emotionally.</p>

<p>so true! and such an important piece of why we are truly on the right side of what's going on.<br>
the PTB have been actively trying EVERY tactic they possibly can to divide us along any imaginary fault-line they can find: Black/White Gay/Straight Male/Female Left/Right My God/Your God - for decades!<br>
If you've got an ounce of soul you see through it easily but you may get caught up in it now and again over the years because it's all that culture ever goes on about!<br>

        <p>If someone uses conservative as an insult that is a bad sign about them. This means that they are willing to sacrifice personal connections because they disagree with someone politically. And even on the sane side of the political spectrum you can fibd issues you would disagree on. So I would not trust them to be too reliable friends.</p>

<p>My best advice: get out. By that, I mean be outdoors as much as you can. Vitamin D, fresh air are huge. Look at the homeless population. COVID didn't hit them and they aren't masking or distancing. (Trust me, there's a homeless camp right by a bus stop I use to get to/from work)</p>

        <p>I would encourage you to research into have libertarians and the 2020 presidential election.
I also don’t support Biden. I chose the favorable option in my eyes.
Many of my conservative and republican family members and friends also voted for Biden. </p>
<p>I really don’t want to get into politics though, I like to respect and understand everyone’s views and thoughts.</p>

        <p>Fair compromise when asked about whether you're vaccinated or not is to tell people that you're not comfortable sharing your private medical information. That's what I've been doing. Well, I'm not being gentle about it though.  </p>

        <p>Hi,
In the area where I live there was a point where the hospitals were completely overwhelmed with COVID and other things that they had to deny patients. I had to watch my family member who worked there come home exhausted and mentally drained every day seeing death. </p>
<p>During that time of a surge of cases I understand why the government put in restrictions.</p>
<p>Now that the vaccine is out and people can make that choice to get it and cases are generally down I think it’s time to end all restrictions and leave the choice up to everyone.</p>
<p>I realize this may be a bit of an unpopular opinion in this sub. I completely respect and understand your opinion though.</p>
<p>I would be open to here other people’s thoughts on restrictions though. I’m a pretty open minded person, and try to see all sides of things and people’s opinions.</p>

<p>&rt;During that time of a surge of cases I understand why the government put in restrictions.</p>
<p>Just like the overwhelmed hospitals during the deadly 2018 flu endemic?</p>

        <p>At 18, it will be difficult to find like-minded peers. Most kids come out of school indoctrinated with a liberal mindset. It will take years of real life experience for them to realize how the world really works and many never will. (For the record I am a former democrat turned libertarian) </p>
<p>You are already ahead of your peers as far as the awakening. Be proud of your intelligence and your ability to question authority. It’s a gift. Stand strong in your beliefs.</p>

I'd like to direct your attention to this <a href="https://brandnewtube.com/watch/the-new-normal-documentary_ecuUiUhHpP9INeh.html">documentary</a>.<br>
It pretty much explains why all of this is going on.<br>
If you understand the big picture, you see how all the jigsaw pieces fit together. <br>
- what we do about it from here, most of us are still trying to figure out..<br>
mandated vaccine is already too far down a slippery slope that leads to total control - I guess a few people are ok with that but the majority are just unaware of what's coming (and they're helping it materialise faster).<br>
Stay safe and good luck sister.</p>

        <p>I feel for you. I’m so glad I went through my teenage years a little over a decade ago. I thought schools (definitely college) were just brainwashing institutions….but fuck, it’s gotten so much worse over the last 10-15 years. “Woke culture” and social media has been so effective at preventing kids today from questioning things and thinking for themselves. So many young people today think they’re so intelligent and well educated yet all they do is parrot what their institutions and MSM/social media feed tell them to. I feel for the youth - especially those (like yourself) that see through the bullshit but are surrounded by obedient non questioning 🐑</p>

        <p>There’s nothing wrong with being called conservative, being a republican, or having your own beliefs. I just wanted to clear that up that I support everyone’s opinions and what everyone believes in :)

        <p>I'm sorry to say this because if you are left leaning you're probably into the BLM and trans stuff but in my opinion theyve used the same tactics as left wing media used with the above .. agree with this or youre a bad person.. or youre against science.. or you want to kill grandma.. and since Trump wasnt keen on masks if you dont wear your mask and get a vaccine youre an alt right white supremacist. </p>
<p>Its tactics to make everybody fall in line. The majority got the vaccine not because they are scared of covid or because they thought it made logical sense to get it, but because they were scared what their peers would think of them if they didnt. They were scared of receiving what youre receiving. Most people just want to be liked, I guess thats social medias fault.. and they will do anything to avoid conflict, even take a vaccine for a virus that wouldnt affect them. This trait of wanting to be liked is also more common in females (not being sexist just an observation lol) which is why probably none of your female friends are also not getting it, and why most of your female friends probably think george floyd is a hero 🤷</p>
<p>Just stay strong, dont worry about trying to justify your decision because theyll come out with nonsense they heard on the news. Every person who buckles under pressure now makes it worse for those that are unvaccinated. </p>
<p>Take care!</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yeah I voted for Biden. That might make me a bit unpopular on here. I don’t necessarily support Biden but I supported his beliefs more then Trumps. </p>
<p>That being said, I don’t think anyone should ever be attacked for there views. It’s okay with me if you don’t support the same things I support, everyone deserves to be respected.</p>
<p>I support black lives matter but not the movement itself. They handled it completely wrong and I don’t agree with how it was done. The burning, the separation, and the movement against cops was not good. I support BLM and our brave police officers </p>
<p>I’m also completely and whole heartily support the LGBTQ community. They deserve completely equal rights and support. Not really sure what “trans stuff” means. </p>
<p>I don’t think the “left” or “right” is evil. I think people need to come together and respect each other’s opinions.
Unfortunately that will probably never happen. </p>
<p>The reason I’m against the vaccine for myself is that Mrna technology is too new and untested for me to get it and i’m worried about how it will play out. </p>
<p>Thanks for you comment and view though :) I do feel that it’s going to become a dangerous game when people don’t let unvaccinated people into places and start requiring these things. I hope that freedom still remains.</p>

<li>I wear my mask because I don’t want to get sick in general with anything. COVID, the flu, etc. 
If there’s a sign that says please wear a mask, I will. If a business feels more comfortable with me wearing one, I will. It’s a piece of fabric on my face. I really don’t care that much about wearing one. If it makes someone else feel more comfortable or safe I’ll wear one.</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand why in certain areas if cases were surging and hospitals were overwhelmed that things should be locked down. I think that now a lockdown dosent make sense. 
I realize this may be a super unpopular opinion on this sub. 
I’m open to hearing other opinions on this, and new information. 
Thanks for your comment :)</p>

        <p>Thank you for yours :)</p>

<p>This part is something I 100% agree with. It's your choice to do so, and I understand the place this comes from. I will still refuse myself because I refuse to yield to rules that have zero logic behind it, and I refuse to validate people's mental illness (germophobia used to be one, at least).</p>
<p>&rt; I wear my mask because I don’t want to get sick in general with anything. COVID, the flu, etc</p>
<p>This is the part I have a problem with. Masks give you exactly zero protection against those things, and give people around you zero protection from these things in the case you're carrying any of them. There is a very substantial body of research around this before 2019, and the CDC itself has admitted that airborne spread is a thing on May the 7th. If airborne spread is a thing then masks are 100% useless against COVID - the whole "wear a mask to protect others" thing was standing on the supposed fact that spread was <em>not</em> airborne but just happened through droplets. The CDC admitting airborne spread is a thing invalidates their own mask suggestions.</p>
<p>&rt; I understand why in certain areas if cases were surging and hospitals were overwhelmed that things should be locked down.</p>
<p>Thing is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No hospital in the US has been overwhelmed at any point in time during the pandemic. When CNN talks of 95% ICU occupancy they're not lying, problem is <em>that's how it is every single flu season</em>. Did we lock down for bad flu seasons in the past? While one could argue about the effects on the hospital system between March-May 2020, especially in Europe (and that's a stretch again, but still), there was <em>absolutely no reason</em> to lock down last winter. Many countries in Europe have been <em>completely locked down</em> (as in, you can't get out of your home except for a given set of reasons) for 7 months last winter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore: lockdowns do nothing. For as counterintuitive that might be, one has to look at the statistical evidence we have. There's no other possible explanation if you look at places like Florida, Texas, South Dakota... or Sweden. Florida has been wide open since September 2020. Absolutely nothing has happened there. Fauci was shouting from his podium for weeks about the fact that everybody was soon going to die in Florida, just look it up, it's still there if you search. Absolutely nothing happened. He is still allowed to spit garbage without any opposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if lockdowns did something (they don't), the collateral damage they do is just too massive. Every single pandemic guide pre 2020 recognize that fact. Very few pandemic guides even hint at the fact that lockdowns are a possibility - they were considered such a bad tradeoff that they weren't even contemplated. And that's for sicknesses <em>way</em> worse than this one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And furthermore again: one has to look at the mortality profile when considering action. Average death from COVID is 80+ years old, consistently across nations and continents. 2 or more preexisting conditions. Those are the people you should try to protect. Considering to destroy young generations' future and lives for a chance they're not going to infect grandma is an example of everything that's wrong with our contemporary society - a gerontocracy. Boomers are more than happy to throw their children under the bus and they have done so repeatedly... for as long as TV makes them feel ok about it, everything is fine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">There were better ways</a>. They have been methodically and programmatically slandered by mainstream media. Fear has been pumped non stop, to justify actions that have no place in a country that calls itself democratic. I'm afraid this is the end of freedom as we knew it in the west, and it's really really sad the way it has happened - a generation that just looked the other way, cowering in fear for a disease that is little worse than the flu, allowing to destroy every single thing that made the west great, and doesn't even feel responsible for it.</p>

        <p>I hear you - I don't understand the people who are vaccinated who are so, so angry at those of us who can't be/aren't vaccinated. My understanding of the vaccine so far is that vaccinated people can still get and transmit the virus - their vaccine potentially prevents them from being hospitalized or dying from it. But that's it. So, in reality, the vaccine really is "just for you" and if they believe in the power of the vaccine, they shouldn't worry about those who aren't vaccinated/can't be vaccinated for whatever reason.</p>

        <p>Fuck what other people think. Do what you think is best for YOU. I did my own research into both c19 and the vaccine and I decided that- for me- I’d rather risk getting c19 (again, since the first time I had it was a joke) than take a bigger risk with the vaccine. Cheers.</p>

        <p>Those who are of the left are in an infinite purity spiral and if you don’t align with their specific flavor you are not of the left. It moves left constantly. Not because of facts or data but because it’s a continuous effort to be holier than thou to signal status.</p>

        <p>I kinda try to stay out of politics in general but the reason I consider myself left leaning is because i’m pro choice, believe in climate change and want to help actively fix it, and i’m pro LGBTQ rights. 
That’s about where it ends. </p>
<p>Economically I’m more conservative, i’m also pro as much freedom as possible. </p>
<p>I do agree that it has scared me a bit how much people are pushing the vaccine and how they treat people that make the choice not to get it.</p>

        <p>I think this is a great opportunity for you to open up your mind to the alternative positions. You’ve bought into the rest of their rhetoric when it comes to every other topic. What if the other side wasn’t as evil as you were lead to believe? This is how they operate: demonize without any substantial evidence. Like how are you going to know if a vaccine is effective if &lt;99.7% of the normal population is going to survive COVID anyways? Or all the cases of people who have the vaccine but still get the virus regardless?</p>
<p>I just encourage you to fully look at every other position these people have fed you. You’ve seen how they lie and treat those who don’t align with them. Go see if they lied to you about other things. I’ve been reading Thomas Sowell’s “vision of the anointed”, which demonstrates how even further back they’ve always been like this. That might be a good place to start. You might be libertarian leaning as opposed to a leftist.</p>

        <p>Just be thankful that you're not oblivious to the bullshit like so many are. And people are calling you a conservative because the media has conditioned them to believe that anyone who goes against the official narrative coming from the currently democrat-run government means you are not just a "conservative", but likely also a white supremacist and anarchist.</p>
<p>People are crazy and asleep at the wheel. I'm sure they'll wake up eventually, but for many it will be too late.</p>

        <p>I understand!  You can Zoom out in history and will see that you are on the right side. Taking the high road is always hard. Many people during WW2 turned their back on humanity and morality. Either through fear or through hate. But there were the few that stood up to tyranny, protected those who needed protection at the risk of their own safety. 
When I was in high school I was taught to ask questions, seek truth and not to give in to peer pressure. " be your own person" they said. How far we have fallen. Remember, even after Jesus performed miracles and told the truth he was still not accepted and those who followed him even worse.
I can leave you with this. You cannot " UnVax". You can always beat covid. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. You are not alone. 
Hope this helps

        <p>This might come off pretty boomer and negative of me (as someone twice your age 👴🏻) but you’ve actually already learned a hard but valuable lesson about people. </p>
<p>Sorry to hear your friends are starting to judge you, but tbh those won’t be lifetime friends. No matter how great you get along, cool hobbies in common, the best friends will be the ones you share the same VALUES with. </p>
<p>I came up listening to punk and metal, and radical politics. I have over a dozen ‘friends’ who I thought had my back as a person, not a collection of ideas. Only to find out that when I started seeing the patterns of authoritarianism in the lockdown narrative, mandated vaccines, etc they all distanced themselves from me, while still claiming to be “Punx and anarchists”</p>
<p>Again, it’s tough medicine and sorry you are starting to feel alone, but better to learn that lesson at a young age and then you can really base your friendships on how these people will treat or respect you in a true crisis.</p>

        <p>This is why I was against wearing masks. It was a simple way to polarize people. Wearing a mask is too easy, and makes people such as yourself feel you were doing your part to contribute to the "greater good" when you were actually hurting yourself long term. It was an illusion. What you're feeling now is the result of complying with that simple yet banal request. </p>
<p>All tyranny starts with what appears to be a simple harmless "rule" but rapidly descends into a totalitarian nightmare. At some point you're going to have to ditch the masks because it will become increasingly clear any compliance with authorities is a death sentence, morally, spiritually, and literally. </p>
<p>This is why insecurities MUST be confronted. Look what it has lead you to do. You're aiding in your own destruction as well as the rest of humanity. The one thing that separates us from the animals is being able to communicate with words and facial expressions. They got you to willfully cover it up, even embrace it and enjoy it. You've walked far enough down this path that you realize you don't want to go any further. Your friends have kept marching along oblivious to what comes next. It's sad because people like you thought it wasn't going to go any further than masks and social distancing....how wrong you were and it's too late to change. You have blood on your hands, a lot of the people on this sub do because many complied fully in the beginning. </p>
<p>Now you have nowhere to turn but here and yet you still cling to your masks. As we move forward your respect as to why we were locked down will evaporate and will be replaced with disdain. You will understand it was NEVER about your health or anyone else's, it was about complete control over your entire life and you aided unquestioningly to your imprisonment.</p>

        <p>Hi there and welcome.</p>
<p>You are right, the majority of us here do understand. The majority of us would also understand if you decided to eventually take the vaccine when you feel that the risk/benefit is in your favour.</p>
<p>Personally, I would agree with your decision to not take the vaccine yet given your age - but as I am not a medical professional and I have no knowledge of your medical history, I trust your judgement that you know what is best for you.</p>
<p>Are you UK or US? In the UK we are waiting for a govt consultation on the use of 'vaccine passports'. I would anticipate that in a few years once the hysteria has hopefully died down, people will once again keep themselves to themselves and pull back on snooping on our respective vaccination histories.</p>
<p>Until then, keep headstrong and do what you think is right for you. Whether that means getting the injection, waiting to see, or outright refusing it. You should never have to 'opt in' to society by having a medical procedure. If you are otherwise a law abiding citizen, in my opinion you are free to excercise your own will and judgement.</p>
<p>The last thing I would say is do not blinker yourself to one side or the other. Keep an open mind. Visit this sub of course, but balance it out with MSM reports lets say. That will allow you the widest breadth of knowledge and the best chance of making an informed decision.</p>
<p>All the best, it is a clown world out there!</p>

        <p>I’m never going to lie about getting the vaccine to anyone.
I stand my ground and if anyone has a problem about it they are welcome to talk it through with me or if they really care, they can drop me. </p>
<p>If I get banned from other subs for being here, I don’t really care. It’s stupid that they ban people for express there own beliefs, and i’m sorry that that’s happening, I wish reddit could step in and stop that from happening. </p>
<p>And, i’m never gonna be conservative, The reason I wrote that I was “left leaning” is because I’m pro choice, pro LGBTQ, and pro climate change action.
Those are my core beliefs and are never gonna change. I definitely do agree with a lot of conservative beliefs as I grow and age, but my core beliefs will never change. </p>
<p>I now realize that’s probably a bit of an unpopular opinion and belief on this sub, but it’s okay. I always like hearing other people’s opinion on things and like to take in new information from new people.</p>

        <p>Can I just say how excited I am that we can even have this discussion!  That you are here and that you are open to any type of discussion on these topics is all a product of the lies of Covid, so some good is coming from this after all!.  Do you have any idea how many people are so much more closed minded than you are and just say “no I wont hear it”??  </p>
<p>In regards to conservatism, something that people misunderstand is that conservatives are somehow ANTI gay or anti environment because we don’t support the activist themselves.  There really couldn’t be anything further from the truth.</p>
<p>Here is our problem with climate change activism.  It doesn’t have anything to do with the environment, literally nothing.  If the activist were advocating for clean water, air and soil we would be behind them.  I live in the middle of the forest in the middle of the mountains and I can assure you that I am far more concerned with the environment than anyone currently talking about climate change.  I have the carbon footprint a step above a native American and routinely do our wash in a bucket if that paints a picture for you, lol.  Environmentalism isn’t what climate change is about, it’s about the exact same things that Covid are about, power #1 and money #2.  “Green energy” solutions are some of the dirtiest propositions in the history of man.  First off they are all contingent upon the storage of energy, i.e. batteries.  Now if you want to know how toxic, corrosive and disgusting batteries are just go in your attic and dig out an old electronic device and open the battery compartment and take a look at that corrosion.  This is admittedly a total oversimplification but it paints a good picture.  Think about solar, behind every solar panel is a battery bank with a very limited life.  Now, think of the panels themselves, they also have a very limited life and there is already talks about the concerns of what we are going to do with all of these solar panels in the next 30+ years.  Recycling is almost out of the question at this point and they are loaded with toxic heavy metals that will soon be leaching into your soil and water.  They also DESTROY green spaces, most people think of them as the ugly growths on the roofs of suburban homes, and yes this is true, but that isn’t the biggest problem, the biggest problem is the industrial scale generation.  Just search for some pictures of solar “farms”, then look at the environment groups that opposed destroying the green spaces for those farms.</p>
<p>Wind is an okay choice in my opinion but not great.  Coal, hydro and Nuclear are actually the cleanest sources that we have despite having poured trillions of dollars into the development of wind and solar.</p>
<h1>Just like they are using “settled science” to silence any debate on Covid or the vaccines - the same thing is being done with climate science.  I am not as well versed as those over on the climate skeptics sub but I urge you to take a look at the information over there.</h1>
<p>Think of the picture that they paint of conservatives, tobacco chewing, gun toting hunters in trucks.  Yes this is true!  We are the party of the outdoors.  If you think that conservatives are the party of littering or polluting the water i ask you to do this experiment.  Find your closest tract of “state game lands”, drive out there and just take a look at the surrounding area and walk the land itself, you likely wont see litter or graffiti or destruction.  Those areas are managed and frequented exclusively by conservatives.  Now drive down any city street, city park or green space and compare the two.  Those spaces are managed and frequented almost exclusively by left leaning individuals.  Again, this is an oversimplification and of course there are clean green spaces.</p>
<p>As far as LGBT is concerned, yes most of us conservatives think of the movement as very toxic, its just another way to divide us just like with the race wars they are ginning up with BLM.  I cant add anymore to this than has already been said by some very well spoken conservative gay guys and gals but I urge you to look them up over on the reddit conservative sub’s or on youtube and just hear their side of the argument about why that movement is so toxic.</p>
<p>“A great man once said that if you aren’t a liberal at 20 you have no heart, but if your still a liberal at 40 you have no brain.”  This is of course referring to your lockdown liberal types and not someone with liberal ideals (which actually tend to be conservatives believe it or not).</p>
<p>Anyway I look forward to your thoughts on any of this and many more great conversations down the road!</p>

        <p>Hey!  Sorry just saw this.  Again, there are gay conservatives (and probably non conservatives) that have explained this so much better than I could but here are some of the problems that I see.  </p>
<p>For one thing the movement seems to accelerate with an ever insatiable desire for what most consider more and more outrageous demands and has become less about same sex couples and almost completely about transgenderism.  In 10 years we have gone from gay marriage to a full, disturbing menu of transgender demands like men competing in women’s sports and men using women’s restrooms.  Now, the movement in my opinion masquerades itself as fighting for equality and rights but that doesn’t quite fit with their demands.  I also think its the push to normalize these things instead of just being satisfied that people accept them.  </p>
<p>Looking back on this I’m not sure that it does a great job at describing the way that I feel (personally anyway) but it was the best way that I could put it at the moment!  Let me know what you think about it and where I’m off base a little here.</p>

        <p>That’s good, fear is the mindkiller and the doomers live in perpetual fear and anxiety. While opinions can differ here, the one thing we all have in common is not to join a sick and twisted society. Here you can remind yourself that you’re not the only one who doesn’t want to stay a lemming</p>

        <p>Sounds like you made an informed choice and that some people don't want to respect that. It's fine to be selfish when it comes to your own health and at 18 the virus is seriously not going to be a risk for you. It's like this covid situation has turned everything we know about basic immunology upside down. 2-3 years back, when things were normal, if you said that hepatitis a/b or polio vaccines won't protect you unless everyone got them doctors would just be laughing in your face.</p>
<p>Anyway there's a lot of businesses that aren't going to enforce that nonsense so shop around and support the ones that are run by normal decent people.</p>
