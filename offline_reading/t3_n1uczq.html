    <strong>Something I gotta know</strong>
    <p><p>Why are some of you against science and believing the pandemic is made to force us into a worse situation? I have seen countless commenters here claiming how the ‚Äúcovidians‚Äù are sheeple mindlessly following orders, even though people are dying because some won‚Äôt social distance or wear masks, spreading it. I just gotta know.</p></p>

        <p>Well the science tells us our methods, like masking and lockdowns which both increase risk and spread,  made things much worse. Science also tells us they have led to mass elder death, DV, child suicide spikes, worsening mental illness, less Healthcare visits, ironically less child vaccination, and more. See you don't know or give a flying fuck what science says or whats right, youre just one of Milgram‚Äôs moralless test subjects. And that's why I'm probably the only one who will bother trying to reason with you in any way, since it's likely to prove fruitless.</p>

        <p>Science is the process of questioning things. A systematic process of poking holes in what is believed to be true, to find what is ACTUALLY true. The exact opposite of ‚Äúshut up and listen to the experts‚Äù.</p>

        <p>Well, first of all...masks don‚Äôt work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks ‚Äúoffer zero protection against coronavirus‚Äù</a></p>
<p>Second of all, <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">here</a> is a video explaining the Great Reset, or the Net Zero agenda, which is not a conspiracy theory. The folks at the WEF <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/covid-19-the-great-reset/">are not even trying to hide the fact that they‚Äôre using COVID to push their agenda</a>.</p>
<p>So quite simply, we aren‚Äôt against science in the slightest. We‚Äôre just nerds who did some digging and didn‚Äôt blindly trust the mainline.</p>

        <p>I am against BOUGHT science and unfortunately there's a lot of this these days. He who pays decides the outcome of research...</p>
<p>Also I don't need science to interpret numbers and compare them to the flu from earlier years. I don't need science to find it strange that the flu has disappeared, which has never happened in history!</p>
<p>I don't need science to know there's no vaccine needed with a virus that has a &rt;99% chance of survival.</p>
<p>When critical questions are not allowed, there's something fishy. That's a fact.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>People always die and it isn't because of a lack of social distance or wearing masks. There's no evidence those work. There is however evidence that they are physically and psychologically harmful. </p>
<p>And to conclude: The PCR is NO TEST and can not determine if you're sick or infectious. And that's what the official story is entirely based on..</p>
<p>People's freedoms should never be allowed to be taken away by government and people should always have the right (basic human right) to decide what to do with their bodies.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All that should have been done, is protect the weak and elderly and because we've gone the opposite way for more than a year already and we're still in this shit, you can conclude that there's more to this than just a "pandemic".</p>
<p>According to the official numbers this CAN NOT be called a pandemic.</p>
<p>Seeing this after more than 20 years of research made me conclude that they are killing a lot of us and (digitally) enslaving the rest.</p>

He then posted a screenshot of your reply in r/confidentlyincorrect for the lolz, in case you didn't already know. The true irony of that is that you're most definitely correct, and there are real sources proving it.</p>

        <p>Thank you for asking. Science is supposed to encourage debate and not enforce a one-sided narrative while silencing skeptics. Here's a visual example of the scientific method that's been used for centuries: https://cdn.britannica.com/26/151526-050-F95C5D11/Flow-chart-method.jpg</p>

        <p>Maybe you are too young to realize how <em>weird</em> everything is that is going on.  It's really weird that the government is <em>pushing</em> something so hard using all kinds of "guilt trips" and psychological pressure.  It's really weird that normal scientists, not "weirdos", who are against what is going on for various reasons have been totally silenced.  It's weird that really promising treatments for covid are suppressed in order to make vaccination "the only way out".</p>
<p>All of those things, and much more, make this whole situation smell funny.</p>

<p>Scientist != Authority of Immutable Truth</p>
<p>It's not anti-science. More anti-authority, especially when it comes to corruptible entities (governments, corporations) engineering sweeping power &amp; control consolidation before everyone is in agreement. </p>
<p>It appears to be justified through a narrative that allows no dissent and uses "science" as a barrier against criticism. That sounds exactly like a religion.</p>
