    <strong>Delta plus....</strong>
    <p><p>This is an exact quote from the book 1984</p>
<p>"After all what justification is there for a word which is just simply the opposite of another word?  A word contains an opposite in itself.  Take good for instance.  If you have a word like good what need is there for a word like bad?  Ungood will do just as well - better in fact because it's an exact opposite.</p>
<p>Or again, if you want a stronger version of good what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like excellent and splendid</p>
<h1>WHEN PLUSGOOD covers the meaning or</h1>
<p>doubleplusgood if you want something stronger still.  In the final version of newspeak there will be but only six words to cover the meaning of goodness and badness.  Don't you see the value in that Winston?""</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentleman, you are in fact main characters in a book that many probably haven't even read.</p></p>

<p>&rt; In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for ‘Science’. The empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt; The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand.</p>
