    <strong>How much of the symptoms are caused by the placebo effect?</strong>
    <p><p>Obvious disclaimer, I am not a medical doctor or a scientist in any relevant field, but I sometimes have two brain cells to rub together and the above question is the result of that. </p>
<p>A trend that I've spotted while perusing various Internet sites, including Reddit, is that the people who seem to get the most sick are always the doomers. You know, the people who completely believe the narrative, the people who still watch TV and read newspapers, the people who believe that their chance of dying from Covid or just catching it is an order of magnitude more than what it actually is, the people who believe so-called Long Covid is anything else but the results of massive anxiety and mental illness caused by all of the above plus not seeing the sun or other people for a year...</p>
<p>Would it be really surprising to find out that those who are constantly told and wholeheartedly believe that Covid is the worst thing that could happen to them, actually feel like it's the worst thing that has ever happened to them when they see a paper that says they are positive to Sars-cov-2? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the "conspiracy theorists" that have done their research into "far-right conspiracy websites" such as the CDC website and other local health authority websites and can plainly see that if they aren't over 60 with 2 or more other illnesses, having Covid is just like having a flu or even a mild cold, actually feel like they've had just that. Probably because they've actually had just that and 45 cycles of amplification PCR tests are complete bullshit.</p>
<p>That's only if they're being forced to get tested by a school or an employer because if you still get tested willingly at this point, you're part of the reason there's still a "pandemic" going on. They need cases because they can't justify their policies with deaths because there are barely any.</p></p>

        <p>I believe that the "loss of taste &amp; smell" is the easiest symptom for people to believe they are experiencing. Taste and smell are very subjective after all, and no test is performed to confirm it. I believe half of the people who report a loss of taste &amp; smell are doing it because COVID is trendy and they want to play along; the other half are deluded or are experiencing it psychosomatically.</p>

        <p>Not only that, I've temporarily lost my senses of smell and taste more times than I can count in my life, pretty much every time I had a flu or a bad cold. </p>
<p>It's crazy to me how people refuse to see the innumerable similarities between the flu, the cold and "Covid-19". You'd almost think the world got immunity to Sars-cov-2 back in may 2020 and now all the cases and deaths are influenza-related because the PCR tests are too sensitive and flag anything as Covid positive. Or influenza got magically eradicated in 2020. Whichever makes more sense...</p>

        <p>I have had this thought as well and I would say it definitely plays a role. Also if you're sitting inside watching fear porn all day you will be stressed and anxious which have been shown scientifically to have adverse physiological effects.</p>
