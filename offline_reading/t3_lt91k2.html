    <strong>hey guys</strong>
    <p><p>i just wanted to say im going to take a break from reddit now. </p>
<p>or at least posting, it is taking a severe toll on my mental health and i feel like my purpose has been achieved. i have showed you what i can, i have alot more when it is needed and with context. just please continue your amazing work here and all you are doing for humanity. </p>
<p>dont let people bring you down, always remember we are all human and we all think differently. i truly believe we are on the right side, arguments and disagreements are mostly unavoidable when dealing with somebody still deeply indoctrinated by the system so just take your time and always be understanding. hate doesnt stop hate, only light can drive out darkness so please just continue the work here with that mantra. </p>
<p>i am going to focus on myself, my personal spiritual growth and my own mental well being for now as my life her on reddit is now becoming too involved with my own personal life and it really is taking a toll on me.</p>
<p>i know its reality, i know its real and i cant escape it. but just for now i need some breathing room. </p>
<p>im still #1 lurker and archiver</p>
<p>see you guys soon &lt;3</p></p>

        <p>There are some benefits to all that happened. Few, but some. People are starting to think about what is important to them. I quit my job and took a job with less pay to do something I cared about at a time when the work was needed most and had the strongest impact.</p>

        <p>I wish you well, my friend. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>Social media is cancer anyway and more people should get off of it. You're making the right decision.</p>
<p>I only started actively using reddit (my only social media) because with all this Covid nonsense, there is not much else to do. I'm an extrovert that is being forced to live a holed-up, sendentary lifestyle, like an introvert. I still go to friends' houses and socialise, but I don't want to go ANYWHERE or do ANYTHING that requires underwear on my face, so I'm quite limited.</p>
<p>Before Covid, I hardly ever even used the internet.</p>
<p>I want my normal active life back!</p>
