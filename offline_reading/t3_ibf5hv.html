    <strong>Well its official. Everything is now canceled except politics and election day.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm basically stuck at home until 2021 or longer because of asshole politicians who are demanding me to vote for Biden.</p>
<p>Anime AX admitted they had to cancel with standard excuses, hidding the real reason is because mayor de blasios and governor coumo political derangement over trump is more important than recovery.</p>
<p>It wouldn't matter, politicians killed NYC and strangled it to death because of their prolonged lockdowns so they can cry for a bailout.</p>
<p>I've already written off 2021 because I have nothing to look forward to.</p>
<p>Every damn person will be demanding me to vote for Biden because they think he can cure everything, knowing he's a horrible canddiate and wont actually help other a useless virtue signaling mask mandate and nothing else</p>
<p>I'm not voting for Biden or Trump, or anyone.</p>
<p>If im told to stay home because of covid19, im staying home for election day.</p>
<p>My future is stolen from me, my life has been stolen and I have no interest in a post covid19 dystopia under biden or trump.</p>
<p>I dont care anymore.</p></p>

        <p>It’s so depressing. I roll my eyes when people scream that trumps a fascist.  Like he’s the only one. Small businesses are permanently closed, I can’t go out because masks , I can’t take care of myself or have fun. I don’t care who’s president. It doesn’t mean as much as people think it does it’s the same team.</p>

        <p>One side of me thinks to vote from trump because the Republicans seem to be the only ones who want to get back to normal. If biden wins will things relax becaus they are the ones in change so they can do no wrong? Or if biden wins will we be pushed further into the dystopia? I'm so confused  right now</p>

        <p>Both sides support this - labor and the liberals. So a vote here would change nothing anyway even if there was a vote. Only fringe parties like One Nation with Pauline Hanson (she is quite awful normally but i respect her for saying what she has) have said a word against it really.</p>

        <p>Trump is fighting to return to normal, taking on the Dems, the media, and the establishment medical experts. He withdrew from the WHO, identifying them as being China's puppet, not the international health organization they claim to be. He is out there dailyy, traveling the country, almost never wearing a mask, with a few exceptions, such as when he visited sick veterans in the hospital.</p>
<p>It is his roaring economy leftists in government are attacking with this prolonged shutdowns and its nonsensical rules - okay to riot, not okay to go to a garden party. He spoke out about the treatment getting 99-100% success rates early on, hydroxychloroquine and zinc, and told the country he was taking it prophylactically, even as the leftist media demonized it. He recently appointed a new anti-mask doctor, Scott Atlas, to the task force, to counter the medical establishment's poster boy, Dr. Fauci. It's pretty clear he's on the side of people rejecting a new normal.</p>

<p>I dont believe you. If he want this country back to normal, he would have made an executive order to cut all federal funds to states immediately.</p>
<p>&rt;It is his roaring economy </p>
<p>The only jobs left in his "roaring economy" when this is over are low wage service industry jobs, gig economy work and big tech jobs that you cant even have a chance to enter unless you are well connected.</p>

        <p>The globalist establishment is using the virus and its fallout to crush the roaring economy Trump had created before the pandemic. Before it started, he had lured back many companies who had moved to different countries due to our noncompetitive tax rates, trade deals that hurt American companies, and over-regulation that made it next to impossible to compete. Before corona, we had a booming economy with much more growth in sight, very low unemployment overall.</p>
<p>Historically, incumbent presidents with strong economies always get re-elected. A lot is at stake. Leftist Dems are doing all they can to crush the economy to hurt Trump's chances of reelection. They are hurting normal Americans in the process, but they don't care. Just like they don't care that the coronavirus death rate could have been a lot lower if they hadn't demonized a known successful treatment and just like they don't care when Antifas and BLM protestors smash, burn, beat, riot, and ransack. Establishment leftists will use their controlled mainstream media to try blame the high death toll and the destruction on Trump, even though they caused it. The death toll in states with conservative governors is a small fraction of the death toll in states with liberal governors, and all the rioting and burning is being allowed, even encouraged, in liberal-run cities.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure why you think Trump won't do what needs to be done when he was already doing it, and quite successfully, before the establishment hit us with their plandemic. A lot of, if not all, of what's going on, is politically motivated, a battle between globalists who want one-world government, and nationalists, who want nations to have sovereignty so their citizens have a say in how the country operates, not just comply with orders from global organizations on high, whom the people have no way of voting out.</p>

        <p>You're right. There are too many people on here who think Trump gives a fuck about anyone who isn't Trump and act like he's going to save us or something, lol no</p>

        <p>You should really really listen to Michael Malice.  I’m very very serious.  He’s an enigma and very hard to accurately describe.  If you have lots of time, look into him.  On the surface, it’s easy to write him off as a weird troll, but there’s much more to him.</p>

        <p>I agree. I don't want to vote either. I don't like Trump. I dont want to vote for Creepy Joe just bc hes not Trump. I'm afraid that Biden would have a lot of top down measures that would keep me from working.  </p>
<p>I'm about done with the democratic party in general. Anytime anyone says anything remotely sensible or realistic about Rona, they are labeled a trump supporter. I've been called a trump supporter for saying flatten the curve doesnt mean people wont get sick!</p>

<p>Trump Derangement Syndrome is real. Very real and if you attempt to explain his policy in any way that is shown from the corporate media they will be hysterical to the point of rage.</p>
<p>There is nothing you can do, all of them are hooked up to cnn or social media.</p>
<p>The same people who would vote for Biden will be disposed of by the democrats while upper middle class supporters of biden will go to brunch.</p>
<p>Even those who are critical trump and hate democrats who debunk the histeria are labeled as yathzees and -ist and -phobes</p>

        <p>Most Americans do not vote for any candidate that does not have a D or R in front of the names and it's not on mainstream news all day every day!</p>
<p>Americans are too political tribalism, they will just vote straight ticket.</p>
<p>I'm not voting for anyone and no one deserves my vote because of the collective bedshitting at all levels of government.</p>
