    <strong>My experience with the Delta Variant and Vaxx Mandates.</strong>
    <p><p>Be me, work for the State Of New York. Get an email from Govenor Coumo</p>
<p>"Dear Worker Bro, the Delta Variant Bro, it's everywhere Bro, it doesn't care Bro, its every where, except at BLM protests of course. That's Science Bro. Delta respects that Bro. Listen my Bro Guy, I'm gonna need you to get the Fauci Ouchie. I'm not asking Bro, your body my choice. Of course you can refuse. However, since the old PCR tests can't tell the difference from the COVID, the Flu, or pineapples they are now a Class I recall from the FDA.  We're are going to have to use the Chinese Anal Swab Tests. Just get the shot Bro. Sincerely, Governor Coumo." </p>
<p>P.S. Did your sister graduate from high school yet, looking for some more interns. Thanks Bro. Put in a good word for me bro. </p>
<p>I decide to take my lunch break. Have to wrestle a flock of pigeons for half a Big Mac laying in the gutter. Can't get any food from the grocery store or restaurants without the Excelsior Pass. Wouldn't have any money for it anyway, half my check goes to child care as the Teacher Unions have managed to extend virtual school till 2029.</p>
<p>Flicking of the last glob of pigeon poop off my burger I decide fuck Fauci and fuck Coumo. I'm still not getting the clotshot. How bad can the anal swabs be? </p>
<p>Fast forward three weeks. Had to admit myself into the hospital. My prison pocket is swollen and leaking fluid. God damn Chinese swabs. </p>
<p>Sitting on one ass check in the packed waiting room I notice that there is no one older than 60 anywhere. My Boss managed to cull the herd so to speak. I remember the day when the policy came to fruition. </p>
<p>"Bro, here me out bro. See, the Orange Man sent us a perfectly good medical frigate from the Navy, staffed with medical personal. Totally isolated on the water. Fuck him Bro, Orange Man bad Bro. How bout we do this, lets take the COVID positive patients and put them in elderly care facilities. See Bro, since the COVID-19 patients are vulnerable and the old people are vulnerable, their vulnerabilities cancel each other out! It's Scienceâ„¢ Bro, bows head."</p>
<p>"Our Fauci, who art in the CDC, hallowed be thy name; Big Pharma profits come; thy will be done on America as it is in DC. Give us this day our daily vaxx; and never forgive those who trespasses against The Scienceâ„¢  as we cancel those who trespass against us; and lead us not into personal responsibility and health, but deliver us to evil...i mean Pfizer, amen."</p>
<p>"Anon? Anon? Please report to the patient check in window," I hear the nurse say over the intercom.</p>
<p>Immediately asked if I am vaccinated. When I saw no way man, that shit is straight poison every ounce or humanity instantly drains from the nurses face. </p>
<p>"Did you say you are not vaccinated," saliva foams and froths at the both corners of her mouth. "Come with me please." She rises from her chair with all the fluidity of a viper. </p>
<p>I am lead to a patient room, the only decoration on the walls is a 8"x11" framed portrait of Doctor Fauci wearing white Papal robes and hat. </p>
<p>Nurse draws my blood and informs me that she will be back.</p>
<p>Returns 10 minutes later with what appears to be 5 young homeless people. "Looks like someone is a dirty dirty antivaxxer and got the Rona, I'm afraid we are gonna have to intubate you on the ventilator you dirty dirty boy." Her body is quivering in what I suspect is orgasmic in nature. </p>
<p>Points to what I thought were homeless people but now realize are members of Antifa. "Hold him down boys," she giggles in glee. </p>
<p>I try to reason with her, "look lady I just came here cause my asshole is on fire, I can breath fine, I don't ever feel sick." </p>
<p>"No symptoms is the most dangerous of all COVID symptoms," she wails like a crackhead banshee.</p>
<p>Due to her henchmen's low protein soy diet she needs to call in a dozen more Antifa goons to try and hold me down enough to strap me to the gurney. She makes a phone call to request reinforcements. </p>
<p>This takes 90 minutes as they have to come from across town using the only method of transportation they can afford. </p>
<p>Which is either an old skateboard from Toys R Us that their parents bought them 12 years ago when they still loved their child and thought they would become a productive member of society, or a pair of used knock-off heelys that they bought from the Goodwill when the sticker matched the 50% discount day. </p>
<p>Despite the dozen reinforcements the nurse has to call in 3 real men, she makes a call to the Janitor department and a few minutes later I am strapped down and intubated.</p>
<p>Cant breath... eyes are blurry with tears. Dozens of nurses stop by to mock my refusal of the jab. Getting weaker...gonna miss my kids and wife.</p>
<p>The lead nurse throws her head back and howls, "this is it, were almost there!!"</p>
<p>My last words as I struggle for one last breath around the ventilator tube that's killing me is "Fauci can kiss my entire asshole."</p>
<p>It gets dim and I hear the cardiology monitor flatline as my heart gives out. </p>
<p>The nurses immediately break into a Tik Tok dance to Kings of Leon- Sex on Fire. </p>
<p>After their routine the lead nurse huddles up her nurse minions. "Ok team, lets take a vote, do we catch up on our cancer screenings or practice our new Tik Tok dance routine?"</p>
<p>It's 29 to 1 in favor of Tik Tok. The one who voted for cancer screenings dies the next day. Throat crushed and lacerated from piano wire. </p>
<p>The County Coroner lovingly caresses his Biden Harris 2020 button on his lab coat and declares it the worse case of COVID-19 he has ever seen.</p>
<p>The lead nurse walks over to mainstream media panel she put together. </p>
<p>"I held Anon's hand when he was intubated. He asked, no BEGGED, for the hallowed COVID-19 vaccine, that he was so sorry for doubting our Lord and Savior Saint Doctor Fauci, and I told him that I was very sorry and it was too late. His last words were that he didn't want his death to me in vain, to please get vaccine, please get that sweet Fauci Ouchie."</p>
<p>My wife who had been watching in the crowd begins to shout "Liar, you are a liar, he would never say that!"</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton leaps of the 5th story roof of the hospital and after a dozen flips in the air lands perfectly in front of my wife. "Here my dear, drink this," and immediately roofies my spouse.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton arrives in a helicopter. Helps Hillary load her in. They head to Epstein Island, which was willed to them for being such good friends. My spouse is never seen alive again.</p>
<p>Wake up, its so warm. </p>
<p>Open my eyes to see Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. "Why didn't you get the jab Anon? You know why, cause you are racist!"</p>
<p>Proceed to tell her that I am less white than the Communist 44th President of America. </p>
<p>"Oooooh communism! Let me tell you all the ways why real communism hasn't been tried and all the way its gonna work now."</p>
<p>I am in hell. I died and went to hell. </p>
<p>I should have called my mom more and maybe not been a dick to my little sister when we were young.</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci can still kiss my entire asshole.</p></p>
