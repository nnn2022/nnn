    <strong>Do you think things will get back to 2019-"normal" - and if so how long will it take?</strong>
    <p><p>Curious about your perspective.</p>
<p>To me it very much seems like it is a one way street with no going back whatsoever. And even if things go back, it may take several years for this as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand - a lot of people have complete lost any trust in the system and open disobedience in several instances seems now very accepted, which comes with this new-normal fascism as well. </p>
<p>So I really don't know what to think about the future, both scenarios seem possible though the worse possibility seems a lot likelier to me still.</p></p>

        <p>Where I live, in Utah, things are trending towards being back to 2019 levels of normalcy. At this point mask wearing is really the only thing that makes things feel weird, and few places are hard core about it. I could see mask wearing being pretty much done by spring. There will probably be some national chains like Costco that continue mandating them, and some hard core people will continue wearing them forever because they are mentally ill, but for the most part I things seem to be improving here.</p>

<p>All of europe gets more and more abused by those megalomaniacs but people are really angry as far as I can tell. Quite hard to predict what will happen next and how it will look like if masses of people just snap.</p>

        <p>I have no crystal ball, but be careful of recency bias.
Nothing goes in a straight line perpetually, up or down.</p>
<p>Just like the bogus virus predictions last year wrongly claiming exponential growth of the virus; predictions this year of a nonstop march to global communist technocracy are also likely wrong. </p>
<p>I expect there will be ripples and echoes and behavior changes for decades and generations, but there will be bounce back towards the old normal. </p>
<p>12 years ago people thought peak oil and the GFC were going to upend Western society. 
40 years ago people thought the cold war would go on forever or end in nuclear war.</p>
<p>It's hard to invision things being different than today or changing course, but they always do.</p>

<p>I really hope so, though the chinese model of enslavement is apparently tried to be implemented all over the world, as that's quite what's happening so far, and that's likely why people in china are -comparatively- not that much oppressed by this anymore, as they already are where the west is intended by the megalomaniacs to arrive as well.</p>
<p>But I don't know of course.</p>
<p>What also makes this so hard to predict is that there are few precedents that even come close in scope of what is now imposed everywhere. And part of these impositions are complete distractions of countless businesses, and that alone will change a lot I think, and to me it seems like world-war levels of wealth destruction - though with still functional buildings.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But all in all, I like the points you raised, the impressions are so extreme now, but that doesn't tell that much about the future as things continued after ww2 or the cold war as well, and at some point they very likely will move on to some other hoax.</p>

        <p>No. Not at all... At least not in our lifetime. Perhaps before my kids are dead they will be able to legally and with social acceptance show their face in public again, have full control over their medical records with privacy, and see family for the holidays without being called a self piece of shit murderer that should die.</p>
<p>With resistance from mere citizens will come more strong handed Government orders until it's actually very dangerous to disobey - but disobey we must continue to do if our kids and grandkids have any chance of living in the society we have been privileged to be in (and this doesn't just go for Americans !).</p>

<p>I really hope you are wrong, but unfortunately it seems quite realistic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;kids and grandkids</p>
<p>No way that I drag someone else into this shithole of a dumpster. </p>
<p>If it is already too late, of course no option to change it, but looking reality into the face and then still deciding to burden others with slavery in this <em>worldwide</em> dictatorship is pure cruelty as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;any chance of living in the society we have been privileged to be in</p>
<p>I have to disagree with the wording here, as it frames not being abused by fascist scum were a privilege. But there is nothing good in merely not being tormented by control freaks, it's simply the standard (not in this sick world though) - as much as -not being raped- is, that's not a privilege either.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;but disobey we must continue to do</p>
<p>Yes, no alternative to resisting their blatant tyranny.</p>

<p>I suspect that if they pull the "this new strain is worse than the original" , shit will pop off.  If they let this thing end, make Biden a leadership hero etc, i think life will go back albeit with yearly covid shot recommendations and dipshits purposefully wearing face diapers.</p>

        <p>I am insanely angry if that's what you mean. I have nothing but absolute hate and loathing toward the tyrants and I hate feeling that way, but it's so intense and I can't help that I feel that way. It's so clear to me that the taking of our rights is so blatant and the fact that so many people don't see it and are even in favor of it just makes my blood boil with anger, more than anything else ever in my life. </p>
<p>From me they've taken not just my rights, but my jobs, all three of them, my high school senior moments, my friends because they brainwashed them, and any meaning in my life, but it's not just me, it's everyone else they've taken that from as well. The coronavirus didn't take those from us. They did. And no, it's not like they "had" to. </p>
<p>Since March, life has been a true hell and that's not just something you forgive. I was watching Buffy, and there was the line "What is hell, but the total absence of hope? The substance, the tactile proof of despair?" That's what this is. Hell.</p>
