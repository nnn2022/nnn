    <strong>I'd be more likely to take the vaccine if I didn't feel so coerced</strong>
    <p><p>Let's get this out of the way--I will probably never take this vaccine, at least not the one in its current state. I already had covid in December and it was very mild for me. I trust my body's immune system to handle whatever VaRiAnTs come my way.</p>
<p>But if I ever do take it, it will NOT be because someone shamed or shunned me. It will NOT be because airlines and concert venues require it. It will NOT be because some Twitter warrior or politician guilts me into it by saying it's for other people. It will NOT be because my employer gives me $100.</p>
<p>It WILL be because I weighed the risks and the benefits and decided that taking the shot benefits ME in some way. Not other people. Not to meet some percentage to get back to "normal." </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>"We need people to get vaccinated to go back to normal." Well, we also were only supposed to be locked down for two weeks to protect hospitals, and here we are 14 months later. I no longer trust any health official because each promise was extended while we, the people, were blamed for being careless and selfish. There is nothing holding any of these officials accountable and I have no reason to believe that they will open anything based on percentage vaccinated.</p>
<p>"People who are on the fence just need more information about how beneficial the vaccine is." Well, yes. I <em>do</em> want more information on this vaccine's long term effects, and that is simply impossible due to the length of time this vaccine has been around. There are no long term studies on this vaccine. I don't care that it was trialed in humans; still doesn't make it safe long term. </p>
<p>"We need to have consequences for people who don't get the vaccine." Fine. I've already lived over a year without concerts, travel, etc. The more this goes on, the more I realize I can survive without those things. There was a point where I would have done just about anything to attend a concert but that time is long gone. Also, I don't like being threatened into doing something. <strong><em>If the vaccine is truly so great, the benefits will significantly outweigh the risks. I shouldn't need to feel like I'll be punished as a sole motivator for getting it.</em></strong> So, shame me, call me stupid, keep your donuts and your beer and your cash incentives; call me anti-science, take away my concerts, relegate me to the unvaccinated section in theaters; all of it only affirms my decision. My bodily autonomy is sacred and no sweaty musicians on a stage or bloated cruise ships will sway me.</p>
<p>"But other people's health!" I don't care. Let me repeat: <em>I don't care.</em> This past year has broken me in a profound way. Everything I valued has been thrown into an ocean of accusations and assumptions. All the things I did to help others pre-pandemic came to be considered selfish and meaningless. So now, I only care about me and my immediate social circle. I am NOT going to take a medical treatment because it primarily benefits other people. </p>
<p>"But the risk of bad side effects from the vaccine is so small!" A) I barely trust the media to correctly report the weather, and I sure as hell do not trust them to excavate the negative effects of the vaccine, whatever they may be. And B) <strong><em>the risk may be small, but it is not a risk I am comfortable taking.</em></strong> As I said, I have already recovered from this virus. I am not high risk. I do not see how the vaccine will help me when I already know my body can easily fight it off. It is MY choice to decide what risks I am comfortable taking, even if that is not in line with what others choose. The risk of dying from covid is also small, but yet we've stopped the whole world in order to mitigate this risk, and none of us had a choice. </p>
<p><strong>Want skeptics to take the vaccine? Then leave us the fuck alone.</strong></p></p>

        <p>It’s the emotional manipulation that is infuriating. The slick ads and the fake medical personnel with their pleas and encouragement. The threats. The bribes. If you want me to do something they’ve broken every rule in the book. Give me the information and let me decide for myself and in the meantime you can fuck off. Consistent pressure is the best way to get me to tell you to go kick rocks.</p>

        <p>This is the most insane thing. It's not <em>surprising</em> of course -- because people are narcissistic clout chasing morons on average. But it's so bizarre. Posting the trophy of your compliance. Acting like you're helping save the world by following the urgings of gigantic evil corporations and the US gov't. How powerless must you feel in your daily life to glom onto something so pathetic as a means of satisfaction?</p>

<p>What really scares and disappoints me is how the average person doesn't see this for what it is. They don't see the circus running right in front of their eyes. They somehow see none of this.

        <p>They can't even have a conversation. Not a single person who buys into the Covid hysteria has been able to give me measured reasons as to why I should be vaccinated -- or why I should fear this virus in the first place. People who are otherwise rational thinkers have absolutely lost their minds in the face of facts and statistics. The science no longer supports what they believe, so "trust the science" isn't a thing anymore. Now it's "trust the experts" because those experts, like Fraudci, are purchased propagandists. </p>
<p>Every single conversation with a Covid Conformist goes the same way, in my experience. Once they're confronted with irrefutable facts, they take an emotional stance and destroy the integrity of the conversation. Things like "WELL 500,000 PEOPLE DIED!!!! I GUESS YOU'RE FINE WITH THAT!!" or "I KNOW SOMEONE WHO DIED OF COVID HOW DARE YOU TELL ME IT ISN'T REAL!!" and "NOBODY KNOWS THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF COVID! WE MAY ALL DIE IN 5 YEARS FROM IT!!"</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ. It's all theater. I love how the first guy is wearing a mask alone outside. Dr. Walker is wearing his for his presumably socially-distanced interview. It's all about projecting the proper optics. This entire thing is well planned and is likely years if not decades in the making. </p>
<p>Again, if this virus is so bad and this vaccine is so great, why are is this propaganda necessary? Nobody who gets cancer needs to be beaten over the head to look into chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Nobody with heart disease needs the president and random celebrities to convince them to get a bypass. </p>
<p>The fact alone that they're <em>so</em> concerned with putting every effort possible into getting every last person vaccinated should be alarming in itself. But the average person just doesn't see this and it's altering my entire worldview. Maybe things really are just hopeless.</p>

        <p>It's not even just emotional manipulation. In some places it's just straight up misinformation. Canadian media keeps trying to encourage vaccine uptake by pumping out a misleading stat saying the first dose of the mRNA vaccines provide 90% protection. This stat has since been debunked by Pfizer THEMSELVES and Canada STILL uses this now misleading stat intentionally to try and encourage vaccine uptake with their ridiculous 4 month delay between dosages. It's fucking crazy.</p>

        <p>Society didn't give a single fuck about me while I was growing up.</p>
<p>My family is a rabid pack of abusive assholes.</p>
<p>In my little community, so few people reached out and gave me a hand when I needed it most.  And even those people dropped me when better social opportunities came along.</p>
<p>(And if you're going to nit-pick about what an awful person I am, bear in mind, this was when I was a child.)</p>
<p>The world didn't look out for me.  I took control of my own life when I hit rock bottom.  </p>
<p>That's why this "other people's health" has always rung as complete bullshit to me.  It only goes so far as people can do the bare minimum.  </p>
<p>So, if you're that asshole that's all "because I care about others", you are a liar.  Shut the fuck up and go away.  Nobody believes that you're a wonderful person.  In fact, everyone thinks you're an asshole with a superiority complex.</p>

        <p>I've said it before, if you made these people give up their plastic crap and their Netflix cartoons and their internet porn so a "proper" lockdown could happen most of them would be out rioting in the streets burning police cars and looting shops by day #2. The whole thing is predicated on the masses having their bread and circuses to cope. Every time I watch professional sports with the empty arenas with fake crowd noises and inconsistent nonsense where the coach or players on the bench or announcers in the studio have to rock muzzles but the people on the ice or the court are slamming into each other and giving hugs to their teammates after a goal only to get a hefty fine and be forced to apologize after they hang out in the hotel room with those exact same people it slaps me in the face - why can't regular people whose fitness is not an entertainment product go do something as simple as lift weights in a gym with whatever hygiene theatre crap like putting a mask on between sets or getting their forehead scanned is in vogue? I guarantee that if the government said "there's a deadly disease going around, to save lives all electronic transmissions except emergency broadcasts are cut off and the power plants are scaled back to a skeleton crew in hazmat suits, electricity is hereafter reserved for hospital operations only" the stayhomeforever crowd would be erecting a gallows in every town square.</p>
<p>How in the fuck is fast food takeout an essential service during a deadly pandemic that kills countless millions? In a real pandemic the army would drop a sack of potatoes on your doorstep and tell you good luck, go easy on that, you don't get another one until next month.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I realized when talking to my medical professional mom about this that I don't care about public health. I just don't. If i'm highly contagious, I'll do my part and stay home. I'm not a sociopath. But I'm not going to willingly censor myself from life just because weak, scared people are afraid of a virus that 99.9%+ people survive. </p>
<p>And of course it's recently come out that 78% of Covid hospitalizations were people who were obese. Of course. But God forbid you suggest they diet or exercise. So wait, I have to wear a mask on my face in public for the rest of my life because you're unwilling to take better care of yourself? I'm expected to change my life to take care of you, while you won't do a damned thing to take care of yourself? Yeah, no. Get fucked.</p>

        <p>Same with me. I used to donate to a lot of money to charities and donate my time as well. I used to care about other people. Now I don't give a fuck. Nobody cares about my views and my freedoms so suck my dick. I'd rather live Mad Max style then like China. I have a small group of like minded friends and we will stick together until the end.</p>

        <p>It's actually the people who would fuck other people over in a heartbeat who are the most SJW about others taking the vaccine and other stupid shit. I lived with this roommate once who thought she was the epitome of holiness because she volunteered to talk to sexual abuse survivors on a hotline. One time when I forgot my house keys in the freezing winter she wouldn't let me in the house for half hour as "punishment" for forgetting my keys and then yelled at me for doing so and "distracting her" from her "highly important" hotline phone call. Same person who legit <strong>yelled</strong> at me when I couldn't make a "house meeting" to discuss <em>house chores</em> because I had an urgent and critical project to finish at work that night.</p>

        <p>Eh, fuck off.</p>
<p>I used to volunteer. Drove cancer patients to their treatments. Picked up trash on the side of the road. Gave money to the ACLU. Spent time at a foster home with teen girls. Bought a hybrid vehicle and used reusable bags at the grocery store.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, POOF. Wanting to do these things is selfish. Not posting a black square on Instagram was now seen as actively racist and damaging. Nevermind the volunteer work I spent hours doing with minorities, that I never once posted about on social media because it isn't about glorifying me.</p>
<p>Fuck it all. I'm done caring. I care about myself and like, 10 other people. I use the plastic bags and the straws and I don't feel bad. Everyone screaming about the environment gladly sits in the McDonald's drive thru while their car idles for 20 minutes, sending toxic gasses into the atmosphere. They throw their masks on the ground and I step over them while I'm running, which is more than these soft doughy doomers will ever do in their lifetime because they're busy coding in mom's basement in between anime and porn.</p>
<p>I don't care. I don't <em>fucking care anymore.</em> And no gentle persuasions to make me do so will work.</p>
<p>Fuck off. Get the vaccine. I don't care. But leave me the hell alone.</p>

        <p>Where in the US did a lock down legally limit that?</p>
<p>The vast majority was consumer choice.  I haven’t been to a theatre or a sit down restaurant in a year.  With the exception of NYC and a few other cities, lock downs were never enforced for more than a few weeks while hosptials were at capacity.  For the most part it sucks because people are responsible and staying home more.</p>

        <p>In the US that’s been far more voluntary.  I’m in Colorado and my kids classes have continued, outdoors and masked.  Some of the gyms are open at lower capacity.</p>
<p>But it’s a boom for folks who work at gyms - a lot more of us are using personal trainers and zoom than before.  So it’s a wash for that industry, probably an overall win.  I used to pay $30 a month for a membership now I pay about $80 a month for instruction.</p>

        <p>It's very geographical.  Here we were shut down completely Mar-June 2020, then partial capacity with restrictions (masks and limited equipment - 12' distancing), then another closure, then a partial reopen with less capacity, then another closure, then a soft open (could only workout with a trainer - but tough for many to afford one), then another closure (currently all closed).  The chain I worked for was down 94% in revenue last year (reported numbers).  Many staff laid off during the closures, some came back for partial openings only to be laid off again four weeks later, and many never got to come back.</p>
<p>At one stage, the fitness industry (gyms, kids sport/dance classes) was the ONLY industry closed down entirely.  </p>
<p>Using zoom is fine for some things - zumba, yoga, etc. But if you want to use the weights or cardio machines, you're screwed.  The industry that could have been of great help to reduce the obesity issues and improve the general health (physical and mental) of people was completely screwed over.</p>

        <p>Good thing there's a world outside of the United States. Entire industries worldwide have laid off almost all of their employees. I live in Toronto, I frequently hear from people in food service who've been spamming out resumes and have worked consistently maybe a month or two this whole year because of this takeout only bullshit. That's unheard of. In normal times before we were all forced to pretend to care about the health of some fat chain-smoking NPC at the grocery store or whatever food service was the only industry where you could get fired and then 5 minutes later walk down the street and say to the chef I got my SmartServe and I'm need of a job and he'll look you up at down and say OK you start now, I'll put cash in your hand at the end of the night and you'll be on the schedule tomorrow if you're not a fuckup.</p>
<p>I know you're a shutin loser and all but millions of people put food on their tables because normal people like gathering in public places and socializing. Their livelihoods are just as essential as whatever it is you do to pay your bills, assuming you do anything at all.</p>

        <p>Yep. Places in Canada are fully locked down with curfews and legal penalties for being out on the streets. I heard the other day they're considering manslaughter as a charge for people who have parties where someone gets sick from Covid and dies. And people are supporting this. </p>
<p>I've said for a while now that if I was given ALL of my "freedoms" back, I'd get the shot. Meaning I never want to have to wear a mask again. Period. I don't want to see another piece of propaganda from the pieces of human filth who brought this thing upon us. No more temperature scans to enter my building each day for work. No more plastic dividers on the kids' desks. Get rid of all of that bullshit and you can shoot Moderna straight into my dick hole.</p>

        <p>Exactly. That is why when some of these asshole governors lift some restrictions, I still dislike them and do not trust them. I am even leery of Desantis due to this but he did come around early and has atoned for it. Certain states are dead to me until their governors are out of office and at the very least, their actions are publically denounced. As far as Canada. I have family there that dearly miss but I have no plans to go there even when and if I can until Trudeau is out of office and ideally in prison.</p>

        <p>Based. I never gave much thought to vaccines and medical precautions before all this crap but right now they could put a gun to my head and tell me to get injected and I'd call their bluff and tell them to shoot for no other reason than it pisses them off to see a man with actual balls and principles. We all die. You think I'm not scared to have it happen now? Fucking try me. I'll die proud. What kind of weak-kneed pencil-dicked motherfucker fears something as mundane as death?</p>
<p>Not to go on a tangent but this is why the War on Terror was a failed project from the start. Bunch of backwater kids doing the bare minimum for the false promise of a free college tuition vs some big swinging dick fanatics who wear a bomb into a marketplace and die violently along with dozens of innocents to ramp up the chaos another notch higher? Bitch please. The only place on earth that has successfully dealt with terrorists is Israel and that's because they honour God more than they honour man. They hold the long run of history in their minds. Western men? All they give a fuck about is nutting to porn and watching Marvel cartoons.</p>

<p>the current mRNA vax/covax are not even fully FDA approved for safety use (only for EAU: emergency authorized use)</p>

Healthy people (young and old) have DIED, become DISABLED and HURT from the VAX. Then there's the new spike protein news where the VAX causes blood clots in the brains.</p>
<p>YET THEY STILL CLAIM THE VAXS ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE!</p>
<p>India uses existing drugs to treat covid 19 patients.</p>
<p>"Doctor Believes Ivermectin Drug Can Help India Stop Covid-19 Second Wave"</p>
<p>"We’ve seen experts recommend Hydroxychloroquine during the early days of the pandemic, followed by Remdesivir that helped in reducing the multiplication of COVID-19 in the patient’s body in extreme cases. " </p>
<p>"Indian medical institutions have started giving COVID-19 patients Ivermectin off-label. Medical institutions across the nation are also giving the drug as a prophylaxis against the novel coronavirus.

<p>After the carrot and stick phase doesnt work, they coming armed to force it down our throats. </p>
<p>If VAXS work then why force/punish the unvaccinated to take the VAXS?</p>
<p>If u scared of the virus, take the vax.</p>
<p>If u can't take the vax, wait for FDA to approve VAX for u or wait for a safer VAX available for u.</p>
<p>Something smells fishy about the GLOBAL PRO VAX PUSH AND CAMPAIGNS...</p>
<p>TAKE THE VAX AT UR OWN RISK, BECAUSE U ARE PART OF THE GLOBAL HUMAN GUINEA PIGS TRIALS!</p>

        <p>I'd be more willing if government and social media weren't working so hard do suppress negative reports of blood clots and potential reproductive health issues. Give me the actual facts and raw data and allow me to make up my own mind. If I could believe the data about my chances for a blood clot vs my chances if I got COVID, I could make an informed, rational decision. As it is now, the data is so skewed, politicized, and suppressed, it's impossible.</p>

        <p>Right exactly this. They're treating us like idiots without our own autonomy. It's so insulting. The average person either doesn't see this or has no problem with it. It's really strange to me. Like -- they're openly suppressing information. They're using all of their plentiful, powerful resources to push a certain narrative that isn't the objective truth. How are you okay with this? How <em>could</em> you be?</p>

        <p>I think it's the difference between people sitting in a theater watching a movie with no awareness of what's outside, and those without a seat who can come and go freely, clearly seeing that the movie is just a movie.</p>
<p>Some people are just materialists and not really set up for meta-awareness or symbolic thought. Usually, they haven't had the type of experiences necessary to shatter the illusion and view "mainstream" from the outside. In many cases, that is for the best.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily useful to storm into the theater yelling, "Can't you see it's all just SFX? A narrative?" Even if they are manipulated, it's maybe too much to ask them to shatter too. And they suffer too, it's not a competition.</p>
<p>It's easy to fall into the trap of making a value judgement- this type of person is better/worse than another, me, etc. but I'll continue to reflect the world I believe in to the best of my ability. All anyone can really do is stick to their own sphere of influence and trust that control freaks will always fail in the end, especially when confronted with direct truth.</p>

        <p>They never cared about our health anyway. And it seems more and more likely that they do not show the real numbers, because they are huge. </p>
<p>My own analysis: The VEARS database has far more reports of severe side-effects per injection than I have ever seen for any other injection. They may only <a href="https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">report 1%</a>. And weak side-effects are almost normal. My conclusion is that these side-effects are worse than the disease it tries to stop. And I did not even include that we also have <a href="http://www.c19ivermectin.com">very good and cheap medicine against the disease</a>.</p>
<p>But that is not even the point. Why do they not care about our health at all? They did not listen to the experts and doctors with experience. They closed the hospitals for people with heart problems and cancer. How many old people are now in severe depression due to extreme isolation? And why are some big protests allowed anyway? Why push for a stupid passport that will separate us even more?</p>
<p>This is not about health at all, never has been.</p>

<p>If my hand is forced and I have to take one it's going to be J&amp;J.  The media and Normie Reddit hate J&amp;J and have hated it since the very beginning when they allowed the fake news of lower efficacy to spread, so it must be doing something right.</p>

        <p>Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to write this. I feel the same and I appreciate the patience and thought you put into it. This has all really sent me down a road I’ve never been down, and it’s the pressure and judgment that keep me thinking, “wtf, what is going on here?” If it’s so great, I’ll see it and get it when ready. Until then, I feel perfectly comfortable taking care of myself. Everybody else should do what they feel comfortable with. I’ve never judged anyone for getting it FOR THEMSELF.</p>

        <p>This sub has actually really helped me not lose my fucking mind during the past year. I have a couple of friends who feel similarly, but that's it. And the people who <em>do</em> agree with us, know to keep their mouths shut at all costs. Can't come out against the vaccine at work, you might lose your job. You might lose your friends. Even family. My family has basically disowned me for refusing to get the shot. At some point I probably will have to if I ever want to see my niece and nephew again.</p>

        <p>The propaganda is insane. The more I'm pressured, the more I feel afraid/wary of it. And annoyed. Everything in my deep down, soul-level gut feelings is telling me that -at least in my own personal case, and with my own body -that getting vaxed would be a bad idea and may very well be harmful. As in, I think of maybe getting it for a moment and I have a feeling of great terror, nausea, you name it come over me.</p>
<p>It's so hard when others push and shame you into thinking that a gut feeling that strong and intense is just "woo-woo stuff", garden-variety nervousness, stupidity, or selfishness. Those of you who know what I am talking about and I've experienced those types of feelings, know that  this is NOT the case. Add to that the fact that there's no real transparency, things from the "experts" change every fucking day, and that you're not allowed to ask honest questions in a judgment-free environment without being labeled anti-vax, anti science, or a plague rat? You're asking for the perfect recipe to convince me to stay far, far away from those needles.</p>

        <p>I'm happy you brought up the gut feelings. That's the same thing I'm struggling with. I have the same deep, deep gut feeling that something is so completely off with this whole thing. Every alarm bell in my head is screaming. One thing I've learned in my life is to never ignore my gut instincts. Never fails that every time I do, my gut was right. It really does offer me some peace knowing I'm not alone in this. Thanks for posting.</p>

        <p>You're welcome! So glad to know that I'm not alone, too - before I found this sub I felt like I was the only person around who felt this way,  and it's caused so much stress, doubt, and worry. </p>
<p>Same re: my gut feelings: I've learned (sometimes the hard way) to listen to them, because they exist for a reason even if we don't know what that reason is right now. It's a different feeling than just simply being anxious: I've had to have risky surgeries &amp; procedures before that scared me shitless, but it was a completely different sensation. For those, it was the deep feeling of "I'm afraid, but this is the right thing to do" . For this whole mess, it's "I'm afraid &amp; there's something NOT right here".</p>
<p>True intuition is so much more real than a lot of people think.</p>

        <p>Omg yes to both of you..</p>
<p>Same here!! It is my gut instinct/intuition kicking off more than ever before.. I am constantly being pressured by people just to take it and I've now had to remove myself from those people. I have had to take a step back and pretty much say bye to the friends I once loved. </p>
<p>Even though some of the friends are good people and don't pressure me, some will still label me as a conspiracy theorist without ever taking the time to listen to me or hear me out. They might be doing it in a joking around way but I still notice it affects my psyche and I just need to be away from it so I do not confuse how I am truly feeling on the inside. I know they are all impressionable people and give in too easily so I do not want to be around that and potentially convinced later on because my inner gut / intuition feeling as I have said says NO. Sometimes you have to walk your own path I guess which is never easy. </p>
<p>It's similar to when you quit drugs/alcohol I guess, which I have also done. You're basically an outcast to most people in that realm because it is hugely socially acceptable to do that to fit in (at least where I live) and if you don't, you are not invited out as much (mainly with new friends compared to long standing friends you already have established relationships with).</p>
<p>Anyway, you both have hit the nail on the head and have validated the way I feel. Thank you.</p>

        <p>This. How many times have we heard the "experts" say we need 70% or so to have antibodies to reach herd immunity? If this was really about that, I would think the campaigns would have been more "Be part of the 70%!" or something routinely PSA-like. Encouraging, but not forceful.</p>
<p>But instead, they literally want to vax every man, woman, and child on Earth, no matter what,  to the point where the CDC is literally trying to change the definition of herd immunity to vax only . Bullying, shaming, &amp; threats are not only popping up but encouraged. </p>

        <p>&rt;"But other people's health!"</p>
<p>I've heard that one before, you have it as a response to this post already. Let me add something to your thoughts on it already, </p>
<p>There are people that will guilt you, tell you it's for others, "for the good of society", or what have you. Bullshit. You need to make your own risk assessment for yourself and your closest loved ones.   </p>
<p>I've already had the infection, and in the absence of compelling evidence otherwise, I have to assume that my immunity is as robust as required. To take the vaccine now would not offer any benefit to me or anyone else, but would offer me a risk of adverse effects. I don't care how small that risk is, it exists and it's more risk than not taking it. And doing it "fer teh gud of susciety" is cold comfort - what if I am disabled, hospitalized or die? Is "Society" going to step up to the plate and take care of my family? Pay the salary that I lost, or quantify the apex of my dreams and career aspirations and compensate me appropriately? Absolutely not. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, it's kind of like companies that privatize the profits but socialize the loses, except it's "society" that socializes the benefits but tells me "tough titty" if something goes awry. Forget that noise, I'm not playing that game.</p>

        <p>I don't have to prove to anyone I've had it, or if I've had the vaccine.</p>
<p>None of that is anyone else's business.</p>
<p>And frankly, I hate the fact that this whole circus is dependent upon whether or not I make the choice that everyone else is making.</p>
<p>I'd feel better about taking it if I didn't have the burden of societal guilt for not.  That's not how you expect people to do things, because it takes away their autonomy.  And if there's one thing that people want, it's autonomy.</p>

        <p>Not much to say that hasn’t already been said, but...</p>
<p>1) Start being honest. Admit the truth about the blood clots and deaths; they double, triple, quadruple, etc down every time but claiming the hundreds of reported cases of healthy young people dying 1-2 days after getting jabbed don’t have any relation the vaccine is asinine. </p>
<p>Someone that’s been fighting cancer for years and is in hospice is suddenly tested and had a positive result. They pass away. They died of covid, not the disease that they have been fighting for years. </p>
<p>Someone that is young and healthy dies after getting jabbed and they insist the vaccines don’t have anything to do with it. </p>
<p>2) Stop telling me that I NEED to take an experimental drug for YOU. I don’t need to do anything for “you”. If I choose to get jabbed it’s of my own choice. It’s immoral and unethical to try and insinuate otherwise. </p>
<p>Someone else taking an experimental drug and not having a severe reaction means literally nothing in regards to me; can someone with a peanut allergy start eating peanuts because they see someone else doing it? </p>
<p>Stop telling me you did your research and I should do the same; you are literally the research. </p>
<p>3) Give me a reason. I don’t believe that the carrot they are dangling means anything. I have no reason to believe we will ever be out of the masks. 70% will become 80% will become 90% will become 100% will become “sorry, everyone needs a 3rd/4th/5th/6th and on and on booster before we go back to normal!” The goal posts will continue to change.</p>

        <p>I say this to atheists: Would you be against prayer and faith in all scenarios? Most would say no. They might be open to finding some value in belief or meditation or religious practices. But when you’re preached at, berated, belittled, or even forced through persecution, you’re going to be that much more against whatever the proselytizing hypocrites are saying.</p>

        <p>The biggest problem I have with the vaccine is that the side effects and deaths from it are being covered up by everyone. I know the survival rate of covid and the chances of getting "long covid". I do not know the death rate of the vaccine or the risk of a bad reaction on top of not knowing the long term side effects. So until I know those things. I'm not getting the vaccine. Plain and simple.</p>

        <p>Maybe consider it when they classify everyone who dies 30 days post vaccine as a vaccine death.

<p><a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-19">NIH</a>
Money shot: </p>
<p>“The immune systems of more than 95% of people who recovered from COVID-19 had durable memories of the virus up to eight months after infection.
The results provide hope that people receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will develop similar lasting immune memories after vaccination.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00575-4/fulltext">The Lancet #1</a>
Money shot: 
“The closely related viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV induced immunity that typically lasted 2–3 years after infection.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00141-3/fulltext">The Lancet #2</a>
Money shot:
“Natural infection appears to elicit strong protection against reinfection with an efficacy ~95% for at least seven months.”</p>

        <p>SAME. I've always had difficulty dealing with authority. The fact that every possible authority, celebrity, talking head etc is imploring us to get this vaccine is suspicious (as well as gross). Now they're trying to actually bribe people with savings bonds and free money. Garbage Governor Cuomo just announced free Yankees/Mets tickets for people who get vaccinated at the stadium. Why? </p>
<p>If this virus was truly this dangerous and the vaccine was so wonderful, people would be killing each other in the streets to get their hands on a dose. Instead, they can't give these things away. Vaccination centers are actually shutting down because no one is coming through. Joe Biden has to drag his addled brain through a teleprompter reading to beg us to get the shot. </p>
<p>So I believe there just <em>has</em> to be more to this. It doesn't make sense that all of these powers would waste so much time and money pushing a vaccine for a disease that kills essentially no one but the elderly and infirm. We know that it has nothing to do with altruism, so that's it. So I wonder, what's <em>really</em> going on here?</p>

        <p>I know! I know a few traditional "anti-authoritarian" anarchist types who will lose their fucking minds if you dare suggest this whole pandemic doesn't pass the smell test. It's so strange. It's like this propaganda successfully worked on infecting the minds of 80% of the population and that 80% can't even fathom what the other 20% are seeing. </p>
<p>It's truly fascinating. I'd love to see something like this properly studied beyond bias. This has to be the greatest bit of psychological warfare and purposely induced mass hysteria in our lifetime. The power brokers of our reality were able to convince the vast majority of the world to gleefully throw away their freedoms for protection from a virus they're just as likely to survive as the flu.</p>

        <p>I also agree with you about this past year being worldview-altering. I think many of us have had that experience. I don't know if I'll ever be able to look at some friends and family the same way -- those who bought into this scam whole cloth and <em>still</em> buy into it now that the "science" no longer supports their fears. </p>
<p>For example, I have a very intelligent recent ex-girlfriend who still believes Covid is this long-promised global pandemic the likes of which history has rarely seen. Yet present her with any facts relating to survival rates, comorbidities and obesity of deaths, false and over-reporting etc and she loses her mind and refuses to engage in the conversation. She turns to ad hominem just like so many of them do. Having a conversation is pointless. She legitimately believes this sub is full of "narcissists" and everyone here is an "anti-vaxxer" who refuses to do the right thing and help the public achieve herd immunity because we're just too selfish or something. She sucks. </p>
<p>And I bet I'm in the overwhelming majority when I say I am not and never was an anti-vaxxer. I have every other vaccine. I've never spared a thought to it. I don't want <em>this</em> vaccine. Although I will say ...the way this vaccine has been handled so far may very well cause me further consideration into vaccines in general. 1 in 36 children is autistic which is a tremendous increase. </p>
<p>Lastly, I'm a teacher. My school has been open for in-person learning this entire year. From September until now, we only closed for a single week after Christmas break. We have full classrooms of children who don't keep their masks on, social distancing was a joke from the very beginning that nobody obeyed and so on. On top of that, the nature of my job has me in multiple classrooms on a daily basis. If anyone <em>was</em> going to get Covid, it would have been me. </p>
<p>My school's policy was that any time someone came down with the slightest symptom, we required a negative test to return to work. I've been tested <em>9</em> times. I'm 0-for-9. Most of my coworkers are over 50. Some of them <em>have</em> had Covid, and not a single one of them got very sick. Same with the kids. A handful of kids have tested positive, and none so much as had a headache. It's a total joke. </p>
<p>And the funniest part -- teachers in my building <em>HAVE</em> had adverse reactions to the vaccine. One developed a huge rash and was bedridden for a week. A few others developed flu-like symptoms and fevers and missed 2-3 days following their second shot. </p>
<p>So if it seems that the vaccine is more dangerous than the virus -- and I've somehow not contracted the virus despite being in the very scenario in where I <em>would</em> contract it -- why the absolute fuck should I get the shot?</p>

        <p>They’re already laying the groundwork on this. Once the population tires of the VARIANTS, there will be another pandemic for something else entirely, and our friendly neighborhood FUCKING PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES will fly in for the rescue.

        <p>People would be more likely to take it if they acted like it fuckin works. The fact that we’re at 70ish% of at-risk people vaccinated should be celebrated with full reopening. “Look! Grandma is safe now, we can be normal again! Look how amazing the vaccines are working!”</p>
<p>Instead, they’re undermining the science. They’re still harping in variants and asymptomatic PLUS vaccinated spread. They’re claiming we need herd immunity to open them saying herd immunity is not possible.</p>

        <p>Like so many others are saying, this post has made me feel way less alone, so THANK YOU. 
I have been experiencing a lot of mental dissonance lately about this vaccine. My resolve seems to be weakening about not taking it &amp; I hate that I’m beginning to feel like I really am a “covidiot”. What’s recently triggered this is a local house music venue I used to love going dancing at reopened &amp; all of the dance nights, they are saying you have to show full vaccination proof to attend. That makes me really sad...like I knew there was going to be this sort of thing, but to actually see it in policy I guess was jarring. Another situation is a close friend of mine shared with me that she ended up getting the vaccine because she wants to travel. This was someone who was staunchly against getting it (&amp; she did say she would have rather not, but wants her life back). She is what I <em>don’t</em> want to be...but I feel like I’m slipping into that because, unlike OP, the longer I go without travel, live music, dance nights, etc, the more I want and miss those things.</p>
<p>I hate everything about the narrative of this vaccine (&amp; pandemic overall, tbh)
I hate how they keep pushing it. 
I hate that this age of social media &amp; being “woke” means that there’s a constant barrage of vaccine propaganda.
I hate the “Pfizer gang” tees &amp; “i got the jab” pins.
I hate that this vaccine debate is causing rifts in families &amp; relationships (mine included...my mom’s mental health has deteriorated over myself/siblings &amp; dad not wanting to get vaccinated, she literally believes we are going to die before her now that she did get the vaccine)</p>
<p>I have a relatively good mental health state. Years of therapy has helped me get good coping skills &amp; I mostly do see life as a great adventure...but...when I really allow myself to sit with these thoughts, the knowing that life has irreversibly changed (and not for the better), makes me really morose. And then I see so, so, SO many people just....going along with all this, some happily so, &amp; some like my friend, being coerced into it. 
My main concern back in April 2020 as things were unfolding was “as long as my quality of life isn’t affected, I will consider playing the game”. I don’t mind getting tested. I can tolerate the masks (more so I kinda have to if I want to keep my job currently). And here in Southern CA, I actually think outdoor dining is more enjoyable (always loved that about European cafes). But I DO mind having to now be forbidden from places and events just because of a personal medical decision...its depressing honestly that I may never do some things again. </p>
<p>I am pro science and believe in the benefits of vaccines, etc, but to see this particular vaccine/situation go how its going, its making me question myself all the time. And I know that’s because this misinformation, fear, &amp; everything else is intentional. Doesn’t make it any easier to deal with though. </p>
<p>I could go on &amp; on...I have a lot of unorganized thoughts about all this. But its good to know I’m not by myself in feeling like an imposter in society currently. The whole world has gone mad &amp; its super frustrating to be on the outside of that &amp; seeing the impending train wreck. Sigh. Try to Be well y’all .</p>

        <p>Travel, live music and dance nights are wonderful things. I just don't think they're worth doing permanent damage to your body for! Stay strong! I have a feeling we are going to be able to create our own ways to travel, have concerts, and dance. If popular pressure from the 50% plus unvaxxed doesn't re-open those things to us, we'll make our own. There's already a new airline starting for the unvaxxed! Don't give up hope ok?</p>

        <p>In some ways, it feels like people are starting to speak different languages, and completely miss the distinctions of each others words. I can see it being a side effect of echo chambers, and in some cases the definition of words has blatantly changed recently.</p>
<p>I see battles of name-calling and posturing about intelligence. Fruitless "source" wars and appeals to different authorities. The inability to even consider why another person would disagree. I see nuance completely flattened.</p>
<p>It is all very frustrating, and hard to see any other way as an outsider to mainstream culture. The best I can do is focus on my own sphere of influence and put things into it that accurately reflect my perception.</p>
<p>I have learned to trust my self (beyond body, the one that exists in sleep) over authority in all cases. And I cannot be shamed into believing that is "selfish."</p>

        <p>its fucked up. if this was a movie, the audience could objectively and <strong>not subjectively,</strong> argue the most logical point with facts that are not presented to the characters in the film. </p>
<p>But, because we are the characters in my analogy here; we have only the subjective portrayal of facts and information, as presented to us. Meaning, whether the situation is truly wrong or right objectively, <strong>we will never know until</strong> time has passed is things have returned to normal. </p>
<p>Its unfortunate and it fucks me up <strong>everyday</strong>. I would take the vaccine if actually <strong>had informed consent</strong> and trust that our best interest was being considered. But personally, I've had enough, and I'm close to just taking it, so that I'll have some peace. I debate and go back and forth, and make and cancel appointments nearly everyday. I've really just had enough at this point.</p>

        <p>Exactly, completely with you.  Will I eventually get the vaccine, maybe.  But I refuse to be coerced.  Out governor said he’s not lifting the mask mandate until 70% of the state is vaccinated.  Now everyone is hounding EVERYONE to get it.  Does no one see that what the governor is doing is WRONG.  We are being punished for a crime we didn’t not commit and we have no due process.  This is illegal</p>

Don’t believe the ‘back to normal’ BS, there will not be much difference except that now you need booster shots every couple months. 
It’s a trap.</p>

        <p>I needed a DOT physical. The doctor tried to get me to get it. I told him “According to the physical you just gave me, the nurse said I am a perfectly healthy, young male. That means I have about 0 risk of a bad case of Covid, I’m good, I’ll save it for others.”</p>
<p>He switched gears. “My daughter works in the icu in Austin, it was bad down there.”</p>
<p>Me -“Oh, you mean it was overrun for a brief stint, just the the flu causes every year? You mean old people tragically died? I’m sorry for that, but I’m still not really at risk.”</p>
<p>Him - “Well think about your 3 year old, what about him or if you die from it?”</p>
<p>Me- “Did you just try to use my sons death or
My “abandonment” of him when I “die of Covid” as a means to convince me to get an untested shot? You need a new tact, bud.” And left.</p>
<p>Edit. I probably would have taken it, if it wasn’t shoved down and virtue signaled. I don’t think it’s a means of mass population control in the sense of breathing vs not breathing, but I do think it has to do with population control of being alive, or being “alive.”</p>

        <p>i agree with the post... at the other hand... there HAS to be so much russian/chinesse fuckery going on when it comes to false info about the vaccines. knowing this makes the choice of NOT getting the vaccine... also tough.</p>

        <p>Full disclosure, I had my second dose of the vaccine on Monday. I completely agree that shaming people is the opposite of effective persuasion, and in our country (assuming you're from the US), it's on policy makers to deliver a message that is effective at getting enough of the population to willingly vaccinate. </p>
<p>The issue is when those attempts to convince instead harden opposition to the vaccine. So I don't really know what policy makers are supposed to do. We don't need everyone to take the vaccine. Tens of millions can opt out and we can still meet our goals, so there is no reason to shame. But there is always going to be a drive to persuade people, and I don't know what you want them to do. Should they just stop any form of persuasion?</p>

The point is you are able to make your own decisions, but they're not going to stop trying to get as many people as possible comfortable with the vaccines.

        <p>That's good. My dad was the same. I helped him get his vaccine. I also spent hours working at our hospital's vaccine clinic.</p>
<p>People, especially elderly, were very relieved to be getting it. And that's fine; they're at higher risk, and the benefits of the vaccine most likely outweigh any risks. They wanted the vaccine and I happily helped them. They chose it.</p>
<p>But it still doesn't change my reasoning.</p>

        <p>I feel like your whole post begs the question.</p>
<p>You have built up a narrative in your head that the vaccine is dangerous and therefore not taking it is protecting you. I'd suggest that the place where you are making your stand is incorrect. Yes, a few people do die from the vaccine. But the deaths from the vaccine are similar to deaths each year from allergic reactions to tylenol, for example. I'm sure it never occured to you two write a long treatise on how you're not taking a tylenol, ever, to stick it to the man and no amount of doctorsplaining about how it could help your headache or reduce fever is going to change your mind.</p>
<p>If you wrote a long post about never voting again or something like that, I'd disagree but I'd get it. Making your stand on a vaccine is foolish because there's no benefit to you from not taking it and a substantial downside, for you personally, to not taking it.</p>
<p>Also, most people have the luxury of not knowing what it was like in NYC in the early days before lockdowns, masks, distancing, etc. It got bad, ambulance sirens pretty much all day and night. Could NYC have made it through without lockdowns? Probably but it would have been bad. What we're seeing now in India is what a novel virus looks like when it has free reign.</p>
<p>The whole point os lockdowns and restrictions (yes as botched and ridiculous as they were at times) was to get us ultimately to a vaccine. And now, we're there. Touchdown! Flawless victory with a vaccine produced faster than any other in history and more effective than any other. But celebrate? Not you, you're making your goal line stand in a triumphant cutting off of your nose to spite your face.</p>
<p>Sorry but you're wrong. You're objectively wrong; you're morally wrong and you're spiritually wrong. Is that shaming? I guess it is but I don't want the whole world to go through what NYC went through of what India is going through before they can get to the other side. The vaccine is a "free pass" to the other side and you have cursed that free pass and in the process you have slowed the progress we as a society could otherwise make.</p>

        <p>But there is a benefit to not taking a covid vaccine. No side effects. And if you experience physical problems/ailments down the line, you can immediately rule out the vaccine. That’s quite a benefit IMO. Physically and psychologically. </p>
<p>The lockdowns originally had nothing to do with waiting for a vaccine. That is flat out wrong. It was to let the virus die off without anywhere to spread. Then they moved the goal post. And they will continue moving the goal post.</p>
<p>Your reply vindicates what OP is expressing. Shame tactics. Coercion. It doesn’t work on everyone and it never will.</p>

        <p>Okay then people who die after taking the vaccines can be considered like  death due to  allergy..how stupid of you to say this! Why should a healthy individual in his 40s die from taking the vaccine? What if he was destined to live till 90? And what kinda vaccine rewards "death" for providing immunity? Why polio and measles vaccine don't cause polio and measles? Why covid vaccine ain't 100% effective? Why it took only 6-8 months to develop this vaxx while it takes years and years to develop a other vaccines?  And masks won't prevent us from getting or spreading covid coz virus requires very minute space to get in our out of us</p>

        <p>First of all where's the evidence that Tylenol and vaccine deaths are the same and what's you basis of what you comparing is it deaths total, morality rate, or death each 100. Second what to you is morally wrong? Free choice? Distrust towards an entity that uses the notion known has "authority" to have any incentive to take people's rights away just for any "justification". Also another question what is the most intelligent book you have read? Not your favorite the most intelligent.</p>

        <p>I guess a lot of people assume other people do care about others.</p>
<p>I didn't wear a mask and socially distance for myself. I didn't stay away from my grandmother for myself. I did it for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>That assumption people have that everyone likes to help each other is probably why they are confused by people in this sub. That assumption is clearly wrong in here.</p>

        <p>Are you serious? Take five minutes to research it. It’s been the biggest wealth transfer in history, not to mention the biggest global power grab by nearly every government and corporation in the world. People like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates talk openly about how they can take advantage of the situation, and small businesses have been decimated to the benefit of larger corporations. Many politicians made insanely good investments at the start of last year, including investments in the companies that produced the vaccines. Agenda 2030 makes direct references to the kinds of scenarios we’ve seen this year and makes its plan (to have everyone living in megacities with no property rights or privacy) public knowledge. None of this is even remotely hidden.</p>
<p>None of this even takes into account the more speculative theories, but you don’t even have to entertain any of those notions. Just follow the goddamn money.</p>

        <p>I'm starting to notice that people who have suffered abuse and came out the other end are more able to see the signs. I was ok with the lockdowns until last summer. It hit me like a ton of bricks that I had felt this way before. It was gaslighting on a massive scale.</p>

        <p>Why would anybody have that belief? How can you look at the world today and see all the rapes, murders, sex trafficking, greed, wanton destruction, pollution, etc and make the assumption that people will do things for the benefit of others? Millions of years of evolution have produced human beings that are capable of looking out for themselves and small groups of others that they care about, that's it. ANY policy that relies on human benevolence towards others will fail utterly.</p>

        <p>In this country, it's called "free speech." Considering that any individual experience with getting the shot may differ from person to person, all speech about it could be construed as "misinformation" if the wrong agency decided to act on it. </p>

        <p>That's not actionable. And quite frankly, people should take medical advice from their own doctors, as opposed to taking it from the person sitting in the Oval Office, or the person typing news stories into a computer. Because any advice those people dole out is likely filled with disinformation.</p>

        <p>First of all, I stay as far away from children as I can. Most of those childhood diseases that you get once and then you can forget them? I've had a couple of them more than once. That's how my Mother figured out there was a problem here.</p>
<p>I've even had the same serotype of Dengue Fever twice and I can assure you, you don't want it once. There is a reason why some local communities call it Breakbone Fever. </p>
<p>So with every vaccine I get, I go back for an antibody control check. Some work, some don't and I have to try to arrange a different vaccine. Hepatitis B was a nightmare. Nothing worked, and I'm still not vaccinated for that one. I get a double jab of the yearly flu shot, but didn't need it this year because so many people masked up we didn't really have a flu season.</p>
<p>I suspect I'll be wearing a mask and gloves in public for the rest of my life. The really strange part of my story is that I used to manage a medical practice (wife was an Ob/Gyn) and always had a mask and gloves in my pockets. That may have saved my life.</p>

        <p>I've been face to face with sharks, and fed them. I've had morays and mantas as pets.</p>
<p>At my last count I've brought home at least 23 people who would have died at sea if I didn't go out there at night to get them.</p>
<p>I've been shot at once. Unfortunately I didn't have a gun with me or I would have shot back. </p>
<p>Those are all real physical events that you can deal with. The transmission of a virus from an unknown source is not something you can control. It's not fear. It's called, keeping things under control in your area.</p>

        <p>I have. I have not seen anything compelling to suggest that reinfection is anything but rare. Also, vaccinated sometimes get covid too, and we all know that vaccinated are asked to wear masks and stay distanced, as they still can get and pass along the infection. </p>
<p>I see no reason to accept the risk, however small, for no gain to myself <em>or</em> society around me. It's a lotto ticket that is probably means no changes at all, but might cost me everything I have - who buys that kind of ticket?</p>
<p>And if it were to cost me a permanent disability or death, is "society" going to take care of my family or pay my missed wages? No. I don't believe in socializing the benefits and privatizing my risks. If this is so important to society and the effects are so rare, those that suffer the reality of those risks should not be hung to dry by the same society that demanded and benefitted from it.</p>
