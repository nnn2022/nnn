        <p>Just saying‚Ä¶.collodial silver is amazing. Highly recommend. </p>
<p>I caught MRSA in the hospital when I had my daughter. I was put on various antibiotics for a year. I was even hospitalized and given IV antibiotics. </p>
<p>One day, my dr was out and he had a naturopathic dr filling in. This was the first time I heard about collodial silver. </p>
<p>Now, I‚Äôm not saying that modern medicine does not have its place. But! To be truly healthy, we need to really start with a healthy slate. We need to eat healthy, exercise, get sunlight, get moving, etc. </p>
<p>Do you know that in the olden days, they world make ‚Äúsilverware ‚Äú and silver chalices because they knew it was antimicrobial? It‚Äôs really fascinating.</p>
<p><a href="https://sovereignsilver.com/pages/history-of-silver">https://sovereignsilver.com/pages/history-of-silver</a></p>
<p>Another fun fact:
‚ÄúIn America‚Äôs Old West, silver coins were dropped into drinking water barrels for protection against water-borne illness, and during the Civil War, silver was used to treat syphilis.</p>
<p>In the 1880s, the use of silver nitrate in the eyes of newborn infants to prevent post-delivery infections was introduced. Colloidal Silver was first discovered in the 1890‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>
<p>By the 1930s, Colloidal silver was the preferred choice of physicians for empowering the immune system and supporting the body‚Äôs innate healing process.</p>
<p>Silver was used to treat infections on the World War I battlefields, but medicinal usage of silver declined with the advent of antibiotics shortly thereafter.</p>

        <p>Exactly, get the autophagy and apoptosis kicking in. I'm on day 7 of a 14 day water fast, lost 6kg of bodyfat and never felt better, clean consistant energy and razor-like focus and clarity. Wish I'd found it years ago.</p>

        <p>Uses of Silver: History of Support to The Health
A Brief History Of The Health Support Uses Of Silver</p>
<p>For thousands of years, silver uses have included; being used as a healing and anti-bacterial agent by civilizations throughout the world. </p>
<p>Its medical, preservative and restorative powers can be traced to the ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Long before the development of modern pharmaceuticals, silver was employed as a germicide and antibiotic.</p>
<p>Consider These Interesting Facts About The Uses Of Silver:</p>
<p>The Greeks used silver vessels to keep water and other liquids fresh. Herodotus‚Äôs writings, the Greek philosopher and historian, date the use of silver before Christ‚Äôs birth.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire stored wine in silver urns to prevent spoilage.</p>
<p>The use of silver is mentioned in ancient Egyptian writings.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, silverware protected the wealthy from the full brunt of the plague.</p>
<p>Before the advent of modern germicides and antibiotics, it was known that disease-causing pathogens could not survive in the presence of silver. Consequently, silver was used in dishware, drinking vessels, and eating utensils.
In particular, the wealthy stored and ate their food from silver vessels to keep bacteria from growing.</p>
<p>The Chinese emperors and their courts ate with silver chopsticks.</p>
<p>The Druids have left evidence of their use of silver.</p>
<p>Settlers in the Australian outback suspend silverware in their water tanks to retard spoilage.
Pioneers trekking across the American West found that if they placed silver or copper coins in their casks of drinking water, it kept the water safe from bacteria, algae, etc.</p>
<p>All along the frontier, silver dollars were put in milk to keep it fresh. Some of us remember our grandparents doing the same.</p>
<p>Silver leaf was used to combat infection in wounds sustained by troops during World War I.</p>
<p>Before introducing antibiotics, Colloidal Silver was used widely in hospitals and has been known as a bactericide for at least 1200 years.</p>
<p>In the early 1800s, doctors used silver sutures in surgical wounds with very successful results.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.silver-colloids.com/history-silver/">https://www.silver-colloids.com/history-silver/</a>
In Ayurvedic medicine, silver is used in small amounts as a tonic, elixir, or rejuvenating agent for patients debilitated by age or disease.</p>
