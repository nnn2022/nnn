    <strong>Lockdown and weed addiction and the perils of Reddit</strong>
    <p><p>I have a really hard time not being high. I’m 30 and started with weed when I was 26, with a one year break—whatever that might indicate about my situation. I can quit, and I must, and I will.</p>
<p>As ridiculous as it sounds to me, I am having a hard time with coffee shops being closed. I don’t even drink coffee, but I would go there to work and network. Now it really feels like everyone is an island and when my partner and I fight, which is often, I’m relegated to coddling my neuroses and addictions all day, on the couch, refreshing Reddit for each hour I am not dragging myself through a waist level amount of heavy and wet sand (chores and errands and work.)</p>
<p>Yes this is a dilemma. I drive 30 minutes each way, multiple times a week. When I run out I tell myself I’m quitting and need only $20 worth to get me through the weaning off period—which I will begin tomorrow.</p>
<p>I obviously deal with obsessions, neuroses, adhd, etc. How attractive! But I swear I am so much more ordinarily charming and regulated when I am interacting with people and community, ideally in a creative setting. I have had many creative gigs over the years, and now I am getting my real estate license and I study at home. Which is really hard to do. I’m stuck. I know the way out. Just gotta do it.</p>
<p>And so I remind myself it’s not so bad. I am grateful for what I have and for knowing what I need to do. Can’t wait til lockdowns are over.</p></p>
