    <strong>If Dancing Nurses and Mostly Peaceful Protests Didn't Open Your Eyes, Nothing Will</strong>
    <p><p>An entire year of fear-porn, censorship, police brutality, government overreach, dystopian propaganda, fiddled figures, experimental vaccines, "conspiracy theories" coming to fruition, narcissistic virtue-signalling, shifted goalposts, studies and scientists that go against the narrative getting buried, and just general mind-fuckery and you're STILL convinced that everything is perfectly fucking normal? That none of this just feels fucking <em>off</em> to you? How dare you waltz in here, belming behind your multiple face-masks and crazed eyes glinting through your fogged up face-shield, and call us fucking crazy and stupid for questioning things. THE CHEEK OF IT.</p></p>

        <p>This is it. I find myself walking on eggshells around people now whenever this shit is brought up, like I'm talking to someone who's mentally ill. Say anything that mildly goes against the narrative and they either shut down the conversation immediately or just bark in your face.</p>

        <p>You can get through to a lot of people if you do it right.  Talk about the stupid shit.  Like "man I went out to eat last night, they gave me shit for not wearing a mask when I walked in but sat down and drank and ate without one, like it matters" or something like that.  Usually helps open discussion.</p>
<p>Unless they truly believe they are saving lives and a virtuous human for wearing the mask, staying at home, and berating those living their lives for doing different.  I know a few people, people who use to be hippy dippies, that went from wanting to be free and flowing and do their own thing to being bitches to the government and basically begging for that daddy government dick.</p>
<p>Those people are lost until they figure it out themselves.</p>

        <p>I think TDS is actually the key to this.  See, even when a normal, smart person recognizes some reporting around covid being dishonest fear-mongering or manipulative, that’s one thing, but “this is coordinated, massive manipulation, and my country is being subjected to soviet-level propaganda” is still a big, hard pill to swallow.</p>
<p>See, Trump fans already had to learn and accept it over the course of his time in office (which helps explain the red/blue split on severity of covid belief).  By the end of Bernie’s 2016 primary run, most of the independent-minded folks from the left had this pill halfway down their throat, but since then TDS made them spit it back out.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, all the biggest covid paranoiacs also happened to be the most uncritical TDS cases over the last few years.</p>

        <p>I’ve noticed that the burden of proof always lies on me, simply because I’m going against the official narrative. Others don’t need to prove anything because they support the narrative. They can’t see what’s right in front of them. We are living in the Matrix.</p>

        <p>I have no idea what their next move is.</p>
<p>I have no idea what's going on.</p>
<p>All I know is that something is wrong. Things aren't adding up.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Wild speculation incoming:</p>
<p>You know that CS Lewis quote about "worst tyranny is the one exercised sincerely for the greater good"? I think it's that.</p>
<p>I think the high-level politicians and bureaucrats are all-in on the Great Reset because they sincerely believe it's the best way to save the world from climate change. They think the populace is ignorant and selfish, and will work against its own best interests, so they need to trick them into it.</p>
<p>I don't think anything less than an existential threat to humanity would get so many different countries working together. And the only threat of that magnitude that I can think of is climate change. Or maybe an asteroid, but why bother with all this if an asteroid is going to kill us?</p>
<p>That said, I don't know what the motives are of the guys at the very top at this, the guys who sold politicians and bureaucrats on the Great Reset.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say the next move will be introducing the vaccine boosters they're talking about. We won't be able to go back to normal because suddenly the vaxxed will all need booster shots. And then maybe all the kids will need to be vaxxed. And then it's booster shots again.</p>
<p>And somehow things keep slipping towards normalizing governmental control of our lives.</p>
<p>A year from now will we look back on this time fondly? If we were to jump forward 3 years from today, would we recognize the world? I don't know.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>But maybe I'm just getting paranoid from stress, and there's no conspiracy. I have no idea anymore. Like I said before, I just don't think things aren't adding up.</p>
<p>What do you think's going on?</p>

        <p>Whatever is going on, their tactics are heavy handed. I think an upcoming financial collapse, mentioned above, is the easiest explanation. But on the back of that you have Big Tech and Biotech ready to pounce on any opportunity to profit from people. This whole sick until proven healthy environment is disgusting. It’s dehumanizing and harmful. I also can’t factor out the vaccines and virus as a depopulation strategy.</p>

        <p>The one thing I keep asking myself is why can I see the truth and most can’t. I understand there’s some mind fuckery going on. And the fear combined with the isolations and everything else. This is obviously meant to shock you into submission and it’s obviously working since more than half the population has turned into a mindless zombie. </p>
<p>So how come it didn’t work on me, or anyone on this sub? I’ll admit the first two weeks I was worried, not afraid just concerned. I took all necessary precautions but after a few weeks I started seeing the theatrics behind everything. I felt like I was going crazy at first because I just couldn’t see what everyone else did. For a little while I even felt guilty like maybe I’m a moron or a selfish person and that’s why I wasn’t afraid or willing to follow the strange laws. I’m finally at a place where I know for certain there’s something else going on. </p>
<p>I just wonder what we all have in common that makes us not fall for the lies?</p>

        <p>Maybe it takes a mix of paying attention, life experience, understanding human nature and understanding basic statistics.</p>
<p>If you know how deadly things like SARS1, Ebola, the Spanish Flu, the Black Death, smallpox, etc were, and compare that to COVID, you'll see things don't add up.</p>
<p>If you understand human nature, good and bad, and know that most people aren't really altruistic, then you start to wonder about motive.</p>
<p>If you know how large organizations or governments work, or you have experience with purchasing, you know how long it takes to get anything approved and delivered. When you see all the legislation and marketing initiatives pop-up within a few days/weeks of the surprise pandemic, you start to wonder.</p>
<p>If you know your history, and you start pattern matching behavior then to behavior now, you might start to worry.</p>
<p>And if you've hit one or more of these things, then you start to wonder about other things, and you start digging.</p>
<p>But if you don't understand statistics, for example, then you're relying on the interpretation and advice of others who do.</p>
<p>And if you don't like looking at the ugly side of human nature (and who does), then maybe you convince yourself that people are acting in your best interest because "what would they gain if they didn't"?</p>
<p>If you don't know how advertising works, you don't see anything weird about commercials popping up within days of the surprise start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>And if you don't know your history, you can't pattern match to any warning signs.</p>

        <p>Your point about the advertising is a great one. When I first started working, I interned at a couple of ad agencies and a 30-second youtube ad would take a month from creating the concept to making it onto youtube. Even social posts needed to be created weeks in advance.</p>

        <p>For me it's the libertarian streak, where if a government is screaming at me that I <strong>must</strong> do something, my instinct is that it will be destructive and counterproductive.</p>
<p>And hey, I was nervous for a couple weeks. I admit to pumping gas in latex gloves. It's still hard to get rid of the cringe reflex being near others, even though the wife and I crossed state borders this past weekend and went to a bar in a mask-mandate-free state and stuck around for 2 hours of karaoke, which we have not been able to do in our state for over a year. They had a rather silly "you need your own microphone" rule... yeah, my own microphone that I had to hand-screw in to their set-up. Safety theater, even in a relatively open state.</p>
<p>That bar was a total dumpy townie dive, but almost nobody wore masks there. In fact, we got stared at for coming <em>in</em> wearing face coverings, which was a total reversal. You could even walk around without a mask. It was glorious.</p>
<p>The other thing is I'm a math guy and I am able to process statistical risk fairly accurately. And if they would report <em>honestly</em> this is what they'd say:</p>
<p>- Virtually all documented transmission is either symptomatic or pre-symptomatic (usually when you get sprayed by a symptomatic person).</p>
<p>- The clusters in public happen when a symptomatic or known positive COVID case ignores quarantine and decides to run about in public. They knocked a karaoke bar in Hudson, NH for a minor "outbreak" of about 20 cases, but it was only an outbreak/cluster because symptomatic people went there. It would not really have mattered if they had singing or not.</p>
<p>- My state did a cluster report in the fall. <em>94%</em> of the clusters were from home spread and private gatherings. The rest was mainly prisons, nursing homes/care facilities, hospitals, and offices. Basically: places with dry air, lousy ventilation, and people on top of each other constantly.</p>
<p>- My town went into the "naughty red zone" a few times. We never topped 130 active cases... in a town of 40,000+ people. That's 0.3% of the population, and includes the numbers from the prison and care homes that I'd almost certainly never interact with.</p>
<p>- And the CDC has their own standard for a "close contact:" 15 minutes or more, indoors, maskless, with a symptomatic person. Maybe that's too long, maybe not, but "Trust the Science" folks sure do get hopping mad when I'm pointing out what the supposed authority on science (actually Scientism) says. They usually can only blubber a bunch of paranoid "better safe than sorry" nonsense.</p>
<p>- We don't have long term safety data, but the vaccines certainly do seem to be making COVID deaths plummet (personally I don't know if I trust government numbers but my state is seeing thousands of daily cases juxtaposed with a <em>single-digit</em> 7 day moving average of deaths... and my state is blue and crazy).</p>
<p>I did my own research and concluded the biggest factors in COVID spread were population density and the humidity and air circulation of the environment people interact in. I'm predicting spikes in the south in the summer (when everyone uses AC) and dips in the north at the same time (because even when humid, northerners go outside in summer -- we don't get much of a chance to do so the rest of the year).</p>

        <p>I think that is a huge part of it. I started grad school in 2019 and most of my workload consists of reading research papers. Eventually I got really good at it. Coincidentally right before Covid hit I started looking up the studies rather than listening to the articles or MSM. Once Covid happened I kept doing the same, I also had given up politics back in 2017 because it was starting to make me feel mentally exhausted. By July 2020 I was certain this virus wasn’t as dangerous as the media claimed. One day in a group chat with my best friends I started casually talking about my thoughts on Covid and immediately was attacked, I was called right wing, Trump supporter and dumb for not understanding science. I was so shocked by these comments, up to that moment I had no idea Covid or my beliefs were tied to a political ideology. That’s the moment I started looking at everything different.</p>

        <p>It's been an entire fucking year. If you aren't at least suspicious by now after everything we've seen these scumbags do, you're either hopelessly incurious and brainwashed, or you just so don't give a shit about anything that you can't be arsed to ask questions.</p>

        <p>I think it has to do with the coming collapse of all the worlds fiat currencies.  To transition into the incredible loss of wealth, people will need to be kept scared, broken, docile and as dependent as possible on the government teat.</p>

<p>Were all of those filmed on lunchbreaks? Can't speak for whoever posted this but maybe having nurses dance in your face whilst claiming hero-status and complaining about being "overwhelmed" might piss you off and make you question whether things really are as bad as they say it is.</p>

        <p>I mean, there's a big difference in that the nurse videos are filmed in the hospitals which are supposedly overwhelmed and littered with dead bodies. Yet the videos provide evidence that that simply isn't the case. Also life and society wasn't forced to change for the wildfires (apart from obviously having to evacuate the area and the usual fire safety stuff).</p>
<p>If a real pandemic were happening you can bet your ass they wouldn't be doing Tik-tok dance videos.</p>
<p>I have to ask: why are you so fixated on this SickBoy guy? Seems like your account is pretty much entirely devoted to him.</p>
