<p>Experts are puzzled: contamination figures in South Africa have fallen spectacularly without strict lockdown</p>
<p>Infection rates in South Africa have fallen spectacularly, without the help of vaccines or an overly strict lockdown. Group immunity could be a possible explanation, but experts remain mainly in the dark. "The only certainty is that we still have a lot to learn about this virus," Harry Moultrie realizes in The Wall Street Journal. He works as an epidemiologist for the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa.

<p>A disaster scenario was on the table around New Year. A new corona variant spread throughout the African country, thousands of holidaymakers would return from hotbeds and one in three corona tests turned out positive. President Cyril Ramaphosa closed the beaches, imposed a curfew from 9 pm to 6 am, and banned large gatherings both inside and out. The sale of alcohol was also restricted. “The fewer accidents and stabbings, the more doctors in the hospitals could concentrate on corona patients,” was the reasoning.

<p>Just under 22,000 infections were detected in 24 hours on 11 January. Incredibly high, but from then on the numbers would drop consistently. Currently, "only" a thousand cases are detected every day, the percentage of positive tests is less than five percent. The graph below shows the South African curve, calculated on a million inhabitants.

<p>Since February 2, alcohol has been sold again and the beaches are open. The curfew only applies between 11 pm and 4 am. Two weeks ago, Moultrie again allowed large gatherings, up to 100 people inside and 250 outside.</p>
<p>Remarkable: restaurants and cafes had to receive fewer customers, but have never been closed. South Africans are unfamiliar with the concept of "close contacts", during Christmas and New Years they were allowed to visit as many family members as they wanted. Many workers then returned home in minivans, normally a godsend for the spread of corona.

"Small changes can have huge consequences"</p>
<p>How is it possible that the figures started to fall so sharply a few weeks later? We also saw the same phenomenon in India, Pakistan and the United Kingdom. "Group immunity may have arisen in certain layers of the population," says Moultrie. “Anyone who has a lot of social contacts is quickly infected. If that particular circle has contracted the infection, it will be much more difficult for the virus to jump to other groups. ”</p>
<p>Scientists are also investigating the effect of human behavior. "As the numbers go up, citizens adapt and naturally become more cautious," said Saad Omer of the Institute of Public Health at the University of Yale. “A small increase in social contacts can lead to an exponential increase in the number of infections. On the other hand, slightly fewer contacts can also cause the curve to fall faster. Small changes can have enormous consequences. ”

One in 500 South Africans died</p>
<p>Officially 1.5 million South Africans have been infected with the corona virus, only 2.5 percent of the total population. A gross underestimate, of course, since hardly any testing is done.</p>
<p>The excess mortality gives a better picture. More than 145,000 additional deaths have occurred since the outbreak, 85 to 95 percent of which is said to be due to Covid-19. In other words, one in 500 South Africans has died from the disease.

More than half infected</p>
<p>An antibody test has shown that more than half of the population aged 15 to 69 in the two most affected provinces has already been infected. However, it is very unlikely that the level of immunity will be the same in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>The explanation for the sharp drop in the number of corona infections therefore remains a mystery for the time being. “Anyone who claims to know the reason for sure is just lying,” concludes Moultri</p></p>
