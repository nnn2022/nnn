    <strong>Has anyone else gained a new appreciation for SJWs, BLM, and Woke Identity Politics during lockdowns?</strong>
    <p><p>BLM was the only organization powerful enough to truly defeat lockdown orders summer last year in the USA and force politicians and public health officials to submit in allowing free public assembly. Even if you don’t agree with BLM’s more Marxist and racialist goals, at least the protests and unrest were an example of people caring about an abstract spiritual concept related to human dignity. The abstract idea of human dignity has been mostly lost otherwise this past year, the idea that there are notions of freedom and equality worth for fighting for and also the idea that there can be fates worse than death. For better or worse, anti-racism is one of our society’s last remaining “religious” concepts where people can clearly understand there is more to life than existing as long as possible with material comforts.</p>
<p>I am fairly opposed to identity politics in normal times and support old-school MLK-style Colorblindness and such as a perfect ideal, but I have to respect the identity-politics left for at least caring about something spiritual! They seem so much more tolerable than the centrist technocratic totalitarian elitists who engineered the dystopia this past year where even basic comforts of being human are lost. Even if I as a white male were forced to live as a second class citizen in some worst-case-scenario Woke reverse-apartheid-style dictatorship, I imagine I could still have friends and a job and a basic enjoyable life even if my prospects for advancement were limited. I’d take that society over this hypochondriac nightmare no questions!</p>
<p>It could be that the identity politics left is mostly a tool of the same centrist totalitarian elitists I was complaining about (or a tool of self-serving virtue-signaling types), but if there are true SJW believers out there who see how the lockdowns are hurting women and minorities... let’s join forces! I’ll put aside my other ideals and join in common cause and concede on many points! An alliance like Mao and Chiang Kai-shek had during WWII against the Japanese between their two factions! Right and left joining forces against wicked authoritarian centrists!</p>
<p>I would love nothing more than for the lockdowns and mask mandates to end sweepingly and in their entirety via mass protests that morally bully everyone into a consensus that the cost to minorities and women was unconscionably abhorrent this past year!</p></p>

        <p>Same here. If anything I am stunned by the hypocrisy about how their protests are handled vs how they handle covid protests. </p>
<p>As for the identity politics...i found these kids at the block annoying, but now they started pushing this in schools too. Fck it makes me angry, leave kids alone.</p>

        <p>BLM was basically given a special exception to disobey COVID rules that nobody else was given. Supposedly because of the importance of their message.</p>

        <p>No, because they play both sides of the fence.  They say "fuck the government" while simultaneously begging for government reparations.  They call you a selfish grandma killer while they support violating mask and social distancing themselves...as long as it supports their side.  They gaslight their own supporters.</p>

        <p>The woke people are right wing authoritarians.  Just imagain white nationalism, only instead it's anti-white anti-strait nationalism.  Both sides are effectively the same only on different teams.  Both want special treatment for identities and to control the cultural legend stories.  </p>
<p>If course most people aren't core into it like that and are just compelled by siren sings form both these conservative movements telling people they know who the real enemy is and join my side to improve the problems in your life.  But it wont so the capitalists love it and spur it on.</p>
