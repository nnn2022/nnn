    <strong>In Thailand, Vaccinated Tourists Are Still Forced To Quarantine Despite The Appearance of Opening Up</strong>
    <p><p>Thailand has announced its "Phuket Sandbox" in an attempt to try attract tourists in order to save the dying economy and starving population. </p>
<p>In order to enter Phuket, you must have 2 negative Covid tests AND be fully vaccinated. </p>
<p>One tour group of such vaccinated individuals arrived in Phuket, and one man in a tour group tested positive for Covid. </p>
<p>Despite the other members of the tour group being double vaccinated and having 2 negative tests, they will now all be forced to quarantine for 14 days. And pay for it. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.thephuketnews.com/phuket-opinion-trapped-sandbox-tourists-need-test-and-release-80640.php">this</a> news article, "What is flying in the face of the policy to shunt Sandbox tourists who have tested negative for the virus into an ALQ costing in excess of B3,700 a night (~$112 USD / night) by declaring them as high-risk contacts is that right now there is nothing stopping a person from driving from the “dark red” zone of Bangkok – recognised by Thai officials themselves as the most contagious place in the country – to Phuket and being allowed onto the island."</p>
<p>The insanity continues: "As of today, Thai officials have no way to explain why domestic arrivals who have tested negative for the virus sometime in the preceding seven days may roam the island freely while tourists who have tested negative for COVID-19 within the past 24 hours must remain in quarantine for two weeks."</p>
<p>In another article, some of these tourists that were forced beyond their will into quarantine have requested the freedom to return home. <a href="https://www.thephuketnews.com/sandbox-tourists-stuck-in-quarantine-ask-to-go-home-80618.php">LINK</a>. </p>
<p>Furthermore, nearly all Thai provinces have been moved to "red" or "dark red" zones for Covid. This is despite the fact that the nation is also <em>trying</em> to open up Phuket to tourists. Of course, these spikes in cases are due to a spike in testing...</p>
<p>When will this insanity end?</p></p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking this too, but I can’t figure out why they wouldn’t want people to travel?</p>

        <p>So I am supposed to feel sorry that people who can afford to travel abroad -after most people have been economically impacted negatively during this whole ordeal - have to take extra steps / pay more for a vacation? Nah. I think I will reserve my sympathy for the people of Thailand, who bring in a fifth of their economy in tourism and currently have record high infections having to make difficult decisions and put up with assholes from another country demanding unrestricted access. The tone feels like people from upper economic world classes looking down on those from lower ones. One of the first planes to land was from Israel - where about 80% of the country is vaccinated - to a country where like 5% of the population have been fully vaccinated (and this shit is all still in trialing that BMJ and even Moderna spokesperson said were not actually designed to test for reduction of transmission, hospitalizations, or death). I can't imagine the condescension it takes to be worried about someone from a red zone traveling to Phuket and infecting a tourist when the tourists are the ones who chose to vacation in an area in crisis and now expect locals to stay away. The people of Thailand have a right to pressure their government to not bring new potential strains and infection to their country and to take precautions when trying t o balance the books to feed them.</p>
