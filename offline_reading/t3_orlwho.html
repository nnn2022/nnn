        <p>Yep and I just saw acnn report talking about " why hasn't Biden mandated vaccines for all of Washington all politicians and the military? " I think it's because the administration knows if they mandate it they're going to be losing a hell of a lot of their own people LOL</p>

        <p>Last week I posted a guy on twitter, denniscricket_ who is suffering a serious reaction to the vaccine-liver failure and swollen balls &amp; other issues. The drs won’t admit his issues have anything to do with the jab. His l latest update is that he’s not getting the second jab under advise from his dr, until they know if his issues were caused by the 1st jab. And of course Dennis said “but that’s not the safe the vaccine is unsafe”. Wtf.</p>

        <p>They will never admit its the vaccine.  It is of course in their interest not to and they can link it to any number of things.  Many are in on it because they believe the vaccine benefits outweigh the risks. The others who want to prove it is the vaccine are censored or threatened.  If you are a family of the deceased I can't imagine how much this would cost to pursue on your own and the roadblocks you would face in the process.</p>
