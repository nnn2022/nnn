    <strong>According to one of my friends...</strong>
    <p><p>(Who has avoidance anxiety, so while I love her, I don’t trust her perceptions of the riskiness of COVID) masks protect others because if someone who isn’t wearing one has COVID, their particles can land on a mask and seep through, infecting the ‘innocent’ person (she didn’t say that, but that’s the general implication). Now, maybe I’m just an eejit, but if particles can get in, they can get out, thus rendering the irritating things useless, no?</p>
<p>Edit, copy-pasted from a comment below: Her main motive is to, and I quote, ‘try and prevent her loved ones (her friends and family) all dying horribly’. I’m not sure if she knows the IFR and survival rates, as I try to dodge debates for my own sanity, but if she did I’m not sure she’d care. Can’t logic your way out of a position you didn’t logic yourself into, after all. Mentally she’s still stuck in March - ventilators, horror stories coming out of Italy, endless fear mongering and genuine panic. And she’s not interested in science at all, so that makes it worse. </p>
<p>Of course, I am immunocompromised, but frankly I’m happy to accept the risks and live my life. I find all of this ‘ruin your life but it’s for your own good’ stuff rather condescending.</p>
<p>Edit the Second, also C&amp;P’d from a comment: She also won’t let me get within at least three feet of her if we aren’t wearing masks. Even if we’re outside, which is as ventilated as you can fucking get.</p></p>

        <p>By this theoretical reduction you would be correct. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I want to add that it is extremely difficult to convince someone to think deeper into the process of wearing masks. It is such a fear based propaganda campaign it is only natural people become passionate from a side of wearing masks.</p>

        <p>Oh, she’s way too deeply entrenched. Her main motive is to, and I quote, ‘try and prevent her loved ones (her friends and family) all dying horribly’.

        <p>Most links I have read by those who really advocate for wide spread masking wearing fall into this camp. I city I live in has a subreddit and they get so angry when people don't wear masks one would think they just ran a car through their house. It is breaking past the point of total insanity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But truth be told if all you watch/listen to is government funded news outlets you probably would never know how poorly masks work, or how even less effective cloth masks are, or that there is even an early treatment for those who get Sars-Cov-2 infection. They wouldn't know how cases are really being counted, or how  PCR test actually work. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All those who watch/listen to MSM would see is cases. And that masks have to work because it is something physical I can see and it has to make a difference. Once that faith has been put into a physical device, it is very hard to change ones mind. I wouldn't call myself religious, but I think there is a huge reason books like the bible say it is harmful to worship physical objects and idols</p>

        <p>This whole thing has given people with extreme anxiety, hypochondria, and other psychological disorders full reign to live out their unhealthy obsessions. I know of someone who literally would not leave her house or open her windows because a repairman came to do some work on her roof and wasn't wearing a mask while doing so. She literally was scared to open windows because this unmasked filth was <em>on her roof working.</em> She also quarantines her mail and groceries.</p>
<p>In any other timeline, this person would be need mental health treatment. Now? She's just doing her part!</p>

<p>It absolutely is, but fear makes people do insane things. In March when the first lockdown approached our country, my grandma literally said "if they're going to lock up my family for my protection I'd rather kill myself".</p>

        <p>Yeah my friends were like this in the first wave. Now are willing to hang out at home even though the gov reccomend not to host anyone at your place under any circumstances and if you have to, wear masks. They have realized they didn't die after all lol. 
The only friend I know that isn't going out much is immunodepressed and is very cautious every flu season/around any illness so that's just very normal</p>
