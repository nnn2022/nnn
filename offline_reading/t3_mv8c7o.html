<p>Oh, you haven't heard? I've got wonderful news! Vaccines have been developed, and hundreds of millions of people have already received them.</p>
<p>You should really follow the news more carefully.</p>

        <p>What does that have to do with me? I've already been getting my life back to normal without needing a vaccine to do it. All I had to do was take my mask off.</p>
<p>And it's funny that you think vaccines are somehow a path back to normalcy when none of them even claim that they stop you from getting or transmitting the virus. And your buddy fauci even says that you still have to wear your double masks and "social distance" after you get the vaccine.</p>

<p>Yeah, you're right. What good is a vaccine that only protects 95% of recipients? And you're much tougher than the three million people dead of covid, or the many who have had lingering effects. You're a very impressive individual!</p>
<p>Stop lying that anyone expects anyone to wear two masks after getting vaccinated. Name one person who does that. Your lies are lazy, work harder!</p>

        <p>When the prime Minister of Japan came to the white house recently, everybody was wearing two masks. You can look it up on YouTube and watch the dumbasses in charge embarrass America.</p>
<p>Protects 95% of recipients?? How the hell would they even be able to measure that when most people never get symptoms anyway? Have you actually stopped to think about any of these claims you've been repeating? What are you gonna do when you realize you've been sounding like an idiot this whole time? Are you going to admit you were wrong? Are you going to just quietly back away? Are you going to double down on the stupidity? Which door will you choose when the time comes?</p>

        <p>It's so funny that you people idolize celebrities so much and then try to relate something said by, or about X (celebrity) to try to make it relevant to us. People on this sub appreciate Ted Nugent because he's one of the only high profile voices speaking out against tyranny. Nobody here actually needs to hang their views upon his experiences or words. We all know this is a real thing. We understand that there are high risk individuals with failing immune systems and it's no surprise that a former rockstar in his 70s qualifies.</p>

        <p>You know, you guys don't actually know jack shit about the guy.</p>
<p>My father started to become really close friends with him back in the 80's, and everything I've seen points to him being a wild, yet surprisingly down to earth dude.</p>
<p>You can paint him like he's an insane person if you want, but it just shows you're happy to dip to whatever lows you need in order to make a point. It's a symptom of a people whose lives got so easy that they started making shit up to just have something to be pissy at.</p>
