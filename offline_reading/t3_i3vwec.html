    <strong>Protests</strong>
    <p><p>I live in OC. For all we've been attacked by the social distancing crowd as being the "Florida of California" or whatever, there's been a startling lack of resistance. A couple protests I went to in Huntington Beach, but that's about it.</p>
<p>There is a lot of frustration right now. I can sense how worn down everyone is, how much general bad feeling is in the air. Things are simmering. Rather than allowing them to explode in a negative way, like with the riots, let's turn our frustration to good cause. We should start actively (and peacefully) protesting against this nonsense.</p>
<p>In fact, protesting isn't enough; small business owners should engage in civil disobedience against these unlawful executive orders. An ordinary citizen isn't well-situated to do this. All you do is end up yelling at someone in a store and becoming a new Karen meme. But if a business refuses to close, they would probably get a whole lot of support. In the first round of shutdowns, the business owners (like Shelly Luther) who stared down the governors generally came out on top. Getting slapped with a fine shouldn't discourage you. You'll be out of business soon anyway.</p>
<p>Aside from that, if anyone lives in Orange County and is interested in organizing some sort of protest, please get in contact with me. If you live in another part of the country, I'd like to hear what you're considering as well. Feel free to use this post to coordinate stuff.</p></p>

        <p>I've been wondering when the next round of anti lockdown protests in CA were gonna come. The first few got labeled as nothing but far right Trump supporters and dumb people that wanted haircuts. I'm hoping there would be a bigger more diverse turnout if they were to happen again.</p>
<p>I'm not someone to organize these things, but if they happen again i would love to attend. I'm also in the oc area.</p>
