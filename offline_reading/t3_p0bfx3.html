    <strong>Which vax is the least dangerous?</strong>
    <p><p>My country made it so you can’t get anything besides groceries without being vaxxed. Fascism, I know.</p>
<p>But I really can’t do anything else, I’m gonna try bribing the doctor or someone but that probably won’t work.</p>
<p>So what do y’all think? Which vax is the least dangerous? I already had covid so I only need one shot luckily.</p>
<p>I know I’m doing the wrong thing and I shouldn’t comply but my mental health can’t get any worse with more isolation and missing out on life.</p></p>

        <p>Ignore the aggressive thugs here, we aren't all like that. You should know that it is known that the covid vax will wipe out your existing antibodies, in essence making you weaker.</p>

<p>If at all possible avoid the vax because it is no good. Otherwise I've heard China isn't using the mrna vax and so theirs is a little more traditional, like the flu shot. If you can somehow get ahold of or request that shot, it's likely your safest bet. We aren't necessarily antivax, but rather it is this experimental mrna covid shot with no long term studies that we are against. If you can't get the China shot then I don't know.</p>

        <p>Oh my god firstly that’s terrifying… that your country has done that. I wonder if there are doctors out there who will just… pretend for you? To protect people from these awful vaccines. There has to be. Otherwise I have just no faith in the medical world like wtf. I don’t know which is least dangerous. They’re all dangerous. 
Are there protests going on… are there people fighting for their rights in your country? Idk where you live, I totally get that isolation for so long is torturous. I’d be anxious though - would I risk losing my life for the chance of maybe being able to live life again… and how many more shots will they say you need after the first… you only need one now but that’s now. If your country is this fascist idk why would they just stop with one vaccine. I hope someone else has some helpful insight for you :(</p>

        <p>Oh my god that’s okay!! We all need to remain compassionate and kind and understand that for some this is unavoidable and that’s a tragedy and that’s why those of us who can need to keep fighting for our rights… for the world. Keeping our empathy, keeping our kindness, keeping our humanity is something no one can ever take away from us… I hope your dr can help, it truly sounds such a terrifying situation for you to be in… it’s not right. This should not be how our world is! Good luck :( I really really hope your dr can give you another way… there have to be ways to get around it and drs who still have ethics and are willing to risk themselves to do no harm! It’s scary. You are strong for posting and asking and for still looking for a way to TRY to keep your rights and for trying to do the least harm to yourself if you are forced to get the jab.</p>

        <p>I would link but idk if I can - umm check out doctors for covid ethics symposium they did, also bards of freedom on YT, the chats with dr byram bridle give some good insight and he isn’t as aggressive as some giving the info. Not that the aggressive way is bad honestly considering these things… there’s a yt video still up, interview with Sucharit Bhakdi who can answer that too… for some anecdotal accounts c19vaxreactions has some video interviews, particularly alarming is the one speaking with a 13yo girl as her mother, this child was involved in the first trials and has had such adverse effects that have truly left her injured… maybe for life. There are lots of studies/papers/articles that will break it down better than I can. I mean I have the gist of it but I can’t explain it better than them. Personally watching videos helps me understand more than reading articles or studies tho I do read those too but yeah. </p>
<p>Essentially the vaccine isn’t staying where it should, it is then circulated around the body, could attach to the blood vessel walls where it shouldn’t be, creating the spike protein where it shouldn’t be, causing your own body to attack your own cells which is fine except that this vaccine and therefore spike protein and also the lipids which are basically waste at that point which are not able to be adequately flushed out by our body could end up in places like the brain, the heart, the ovaries… then you can get things like clotting, bleeding and there is some alarming predictions about what could happen if then you come into contact with a wild virus if you have an immune system that is too aggressive - so worries it can create an autoimmune disorder like response and there has been some evidence to back this up I am pretty sure.</p>

        <p>Also sorry you got downvotes :/ that sucks and shouldn’t happen. Even if you don’t want the info, whatever, if someone asks a question it should be answered and resources provided. It could be a troll or it could be someone genuinely just wanting to start seeing what’s actually going on and that should not be discouraged at all. So yeah. Idk tho… I hope your question was genuine but even if not someone else could benefit from responses that try to provide resources and information…</p>

        <p>That has been my gut feeling for quite some time now, hence why I’m delaying the vax. But I honestly believe that even if the president came forward and said that the vaxx is useless, people would still do it</p>

        <p>Take NAC, zinc, quercetin, milk thistle, vitamind d3 and melatonin. Thats the advice of Ricardo Delgado of La Quinta Columna, the people who discovered graphene oxide in vaccine. There's a video of this (didnt save it).  Hopefully you find it. Also take ivermectin. Go to flccc.net for more info</p>

        <p>He actually didnt say how long to take. He said it helped people feel better and removed the graphene. Hr said to take NAC first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and to take the rest as prescribed in the bottle. The melatonin is at night. I will get back to you if i find the video so you can see for yourself. I hope you can find a way not to take the vaccine. Im still a few months away before SHTF</p>

        <p>Man, people from all over post here, it's crazy.... </p>
<p>Hmm, I understand you are under pressure, but I do not believe any of these so-called vaxxes to be safe. There is mounting evidence of the toxicity of the spike protein causing micro blood clots, ADE, decimating your natural T-cell antibodies and convalescent plasma, graphene oxide and other harmful excipients like sm-102, and the MRNA itself possibly never shuts off production, meaning you'll need boosters for the rest of you life potentially. I can't recommend taking them. Resist, fight back, do not comply is my only answer I can give you in good conscious.</p>

        <p>For what it's worth, you seem legit to me.</p>
<p>All meds (and many other things) have side effects.  This is why approval normally takes time... so those potential side effects can be discovered. </p>
<p>These treatments have been rushed to market without the benefit of these long term tests.  In effect, we are the long term tests.</p>
<p>Sadly, I doubt that anyone is going to be able to give you a good answer.  Talk to your doc and pick one, if you just have no other choice.</p>

<p>my country, France, also passed some rulings that make the unvacced's lives impossible. hard times ahead for mental health.</p>
<p>hold on and good luck.</p>
<p>to answer your question, try to look for a vacc that's not gene therapy, I've heard Sinovac is a de-activated virus. Of course it's frowned upon in Europe because some countries had it and were not protected from infection. but imo it's the least harmful option.</p>
