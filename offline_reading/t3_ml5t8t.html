    <strong>How do they know vaccine reduces symptoms when covid can be asymptomatic?</strong>
    <p><p>I want to understand how that works.  Do they infect an already covid person, but they would have the virus/sickness before to compare so have immunities.  What is the viral infection load they give that person? How exactly do they know it reduces symptoms? As for the vaccine...  So if it doesn't make you immune, then their is many variants.  Such as the super double mega strain covid 69420 super yolo version.  It would be like taking a flu vaccine that didn't have the strain that went around. "It protects you," but I can't find any human testing of if it actually does, triggering an immune response doesn't seem to have memory in the immune system, bc our immune system would evolve just as fast as a virus that somehow knows the political environment. (link if their was some, i'd guess they did but under the radar, like mkultra) </p>
<p>Also the news is saying it's safe, and effective.  How exactly do they know it is? Doesn't the FDA determine that? Far as I know it's not FDA approved.  I'm sure they already have lax standards if a company pays them enough. Either they developed the vaccine awhile ago or they don't actually know if it is safe, and effective.  I guess it's just ufo alien tech since ufos are confirmed now.  Bill Gates must be some sort of Alien savior. </p>
<p>I also want to bring up why are people shilling vitamins now?  Shouldn't the food you eat have all the minerals and vitamins you could ever use?  The actual pandemic is the food quality.  You don't get vitamins and minerals in plants if they don't exist in the soil. Of course Bill fa Gates wants to block the sun so you can eat his jizz or serpent green.</p></p>

        <p>There have been studies by China and the University of Florida showing that asymptomatic transmission is extremely rare and probably doesn't even happen. Anyone can google this because no source not even the University of Florida website is a good enough source for most of the hypnotized people. Obviously asymptomatic transmission does not exist because logically think about just the grocery store workers. Yeah, they wear a mask at work and in public, but when they go home, they take it off. There are papers from NIH and the New England Journal of medicine among others stating that people SHOULD be wearing masks in their homes if they are exposed. But if I work at a grocery store and my mask I wear at work is not 100% effective, wouldn't I bring it home to my family or anyone I interact with at home without a mask? I mean, if I am asymptomatic, how do I know I have it or not? How are all the family members of essential workers not sickened, dead and dying? It's just logic.</p>

        <p>This is a great question.</p>
<p>The Pfizer Trial, which still hasn't made public its raw data, makes a claim of 95% efficiency in fighting of <em>symptoms</em> of covid-19.</p>
<p>There is a difference between sars-cov-2 and covid-19; the former being the virus, the latter being the illness.  sars-cov-2 causes covid-19.  But not everyone who has sars-cov-2 gets covid-19.</p>
<p>The way they have been counting cases in the so-called "real world", is with these PCR tests.  This will determine if the person has any traces of sars-cov-2.  This is part of the reason why some people test positive, but don't get sick.  Because you can have traces of the virus in you, but not be infected.  (Some experts have suggested if we started PCR testing for HIV, we would have millions of people test positive for example).</p>
<p>Now, here's where things get interesting.  Pfizer claims to have registered over 40,000 people in their trials.  They divided these into two groups (vaccinated and placebo).  Within these two groups, 162 people from the placebo got sick with "covid like" symptoms, while only 8 got sick from the vaccinated group.  From this they claim a 95% efficiency rate.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this.  Firstly, the participants weren't given a PCR test before or after the trial.  These trials didn't use PCR to determine if the participant had the virus or not.  They were only measuring <em>symptoms</em> of covid.</p>
<p>What are symptoms from covid?  Cough, sneeze, fever, dizziness, tiredness.  It really could be anything.  </p>
<p>Regardless, they claim the vaccine group had fewer symptoms.  Okay.</p>
<p>But they didn't show those people didn't have any of the virus.  These people could have had the virus, and not gotten symptoms.</p>
<p>Here's another possibility.  The vaccine, any vaccine, will activate the immune inflammatory response.  When this response happens, a person is less likely to experience infection from any virus, due to the inflammatory state of the cells in the body.</p>
<p>They only tracked these people for about 60 days I believe.  After that, they don't look at anything.</p>
<p>So the question is.  After one year of having this vaccine, after the immune system has settled, will these people still have immunity?</p>
<p>So far, this question has not been answered.  Nor has it been asked.  Vaccine manufacturers make the egregious claim of having to consider only 60 days from time of vaccination.  But never the long-term.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They don't look at the long-term. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This vaccine doesn't prevent against infection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you get the vaccine, you still have to wear a mask and social distance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have no idea if these vaccines will be effective in a year from now</p>
</li>
</ul>
