    <strong>When did you know something more was brewing with the covid agenda?</strong>
    <p><p>I am curious to know when other people started to get suspicious of the agenda behind the pandemic. As a nurse I wasn‚Äôt panic scared like some, I trusted my known and proven  infection prevention methods: wash your hands, avoid gathering if anyone is sick, cover your mouth, even a mask (at work only) when mode of transmission was unknown. Even thought a suggested stay home order would help (always disagreed with the government mandate). I started thinking something was a bit off with the over blaming of Trump, but thought well the media hates him so of course they will spin it as his fault. </p>
<p>A few red flags started to pop up from mass asymptomatic testing, poor infection control standards by covid testers...</p>
<p>Then one day I‚Äôm in conference call with CMS and we are told‚Äù any death with in 30 days of a positive covid test must be listed as a covid death.‚Äù We ask what if there is  negative tests after the first initial test? ‚ÄúAny death within 30 days of a + test‚Äù Even of no symptoms and dying from other causes? ‚ÄúCorrect‚Äù</p>
<p>This was my üò± moment that I knew it wasn‚Äôt about getting trump out of office, it was about fear, control and money.</p>
<p>I have yet to have anyone tell me any other disease where it is mandated it be the ‚Äúcause of death‚Äù just because you have the disease. I would have accepted ‚Äúmust be sent to medical examiner to determine‚Äù that is mandated if someone falls and hits head then later dies. </p>
<p>Every Covid lemming resorts to calling me names when I bring up some of these facts, few try to defend it. So what was your ah ha moment?</p></p>

        <p>^This was the moment.  I 100% agree.</p>
<p>In Canada, our Prime Minister, Justin ~~Bieber~~ Trudope got out in front of everyone on Parliament Hill, and knelt down along with thousands of other people.</p>
<p>And what did many Canadians say to that?</p>
<p>"Oh, well he was wearing a mask."</p>
<p><em>Facepalm</em></p>
<p>"Well, it was a really important moment, therefore it's okay he broke the rules.  <em>Because it was a really important moment</em>."</p>
<p>Unreal.</p>
<p>Our country is being overrun by Authoritarian Marxist Morons.  Please send help.</p>

        <p>y'all truly have no idea what marxism is. judging by the theory of covid being a hoax or whatever, it would have to be created by big pharma, the capitalists.</p>
<p>the US and Canada actively fund anti-socialist/communist efforts all over the world, how the hell could they be marxists ?</p>

        <p>This isn't a battle between left and right.  They certainly want us to fight it that way so we get distracted with each other instead of joining together to change the corruption at the top.</p>
<p>The people in power are happy to fund Marxism if it means stomping out individual freedom.  You'll notice they drop Marxism the minute they get voted in and re-fire it up when another election swings by (they hold on to the totalitarian aspect of it the entire time though).</p>
<p>This is a battle between the little people of either party and those in power of either party.  In other words, it's all little people vs. the uniparty.</p>
<p>One clear way to see this is to look at the over-lap between Bernie voters and Trump voters.  Many of these little people voters liked both candidate.</p>
<p>Just as Trump voters hated Jeb so did Bernie voters hate Biden.</p>

<p>we know exactly what marxism is. most people who literally lived marxism in the soviet union or china will literally tell you that what is happening is literally marxism.</p>
<p>you on the otherhand, are a piece of shit marxist liar. your kind have killed 100+ million. you deserve a 10x worse treatment than nazis, because you've killed 10x more.</p>

        <p>Right! I watched that and was like ‚Äúwatch now they will say healthcare workers are racist, sure enough, shortly after my Governor created a panel to ‚Äúlook into why minority communities were ‚Äúdisproportionately‚Äù affected by Covid‚Äù and mandated all nurses take implicit biased training to renew our license!</p>

        <p>Oh my gosh, the exact same thing happened where I work! They brought in a consulting firm and paid them I believe $30,000, when we had just been told we'd lost millions due to the shutdown in the Spring. They brought in this firm to find out how racist we were, only to surprise, find out we weren't racist at all. But now we have a COO of Equity, inclusion and diversity who probably makes $100,000 a year. And they are pushing the equity thing hard. It's maddening.</p>

        <p>This was it for me, too.  The government and health officials telling us to "stay safe, stay home" while simultaneously encouraging us to attend BLM protests.  And then, goverenment and the media telling us that the protests did not cause an increase in covid cases, but simultaneously banning weddings, funerals, and holiday gatherings.</p>

        <p>One month before the BLM protests started up, in our State and probably many others, we had anti-lockdown protests at the Capitol building. These were vilified by everyone, including the healthcare organization I work for, as super spreader events that are irresponsible and selfish. When our town had a BLM protest and march, the CEO and many doctors and nurses, joined in and supported it. That was it for me.</p>

        <p>That "peer reviewed" paper that came out that claims the BLM and George Floyd riots didn't cause a surge is a joke. I made a report on T_D before it got shut down that showed direct correlation and received so many death threats I had to create a new account.

        <p>When our governor and chief state epidemiologist (you kind of need the visual here so forgive my fat-shaming for mentioning that they must have a combined weight of 600lbs) stood up and told everyone to stay indoors, not go to the gym and eat packaged foods.
This after it was very clear that the worst comorbidities for poor outcomes were diabetes and vitamin D deficiency.</p>
<p>It sounds insane now but I honestly thought, after reading so many studies with the same outcome, that SOMEONE would have to come out and gently say ‚Äòhey, this might be a great time to eat better and exercise more‚Äô.</p>

Then my theory was proven be the contradictions made at every turn by the "experts". The tyranny committed by limiting rights/freedoms and the propaganda used also gave it away.

        <p>From day 1, I thought there was a serious overreaction and that shut downs weren‚Äôt warranted. Then the media, governors and health experts blasted beach goers and anti-lockdown protesters calling them ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù and ‚Äúsuper spreader events‚Äù. They told us many would die because of ‚Äúthose people‚Äù and their selfishness. I knew this was all absolute bullshit when the BLM riots started and the same people who blasted beach goers and antilock downers told us the protests were safe and for the good of the country! And seeing the mayors and governors who ordered us to stay home out protesting too‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I knew what was going on. Especially when they said the protests didn‚Äôt cause any outbreaks. And from then on, they just confirmed it‚Äôs all about fear money and control. Look how many powerful tyrants ordered us to stay home  only to turn around and break the rules in our faces! If covid was really as serious as they wanted us to believe, the political tyrants would have been hunkered down at home instead of going to dinner parties and traveling!</p>

        <p>When my mom who works at a large hospital told me the hospital gets extra money from the government for everyone that has COVID.

        <p>Honestly I think the point when I really knew something bizarre was happening was when Fauci did a total 180 on masks. With absolutely no new data, this dude who claims to be following the science completely changes his stance. Surgeon General does the same thing at the same time. Made absolutely no sense. </p>
<p>Then they start coming out with these mask mandates. And then they start trying to demonizing people for not wearing one (with a few well documented exceptions). Then putting them on children, etc. None of this ever made any sense from a medical/scientific standpoint. </p>
<p>Then they started censoring anyone who says anything remotely against the narrative (that covid is the worst virus in the history of mankind). The only thing that can save us is masking forever and never doing anything that involves human to human contact.</p>
<p>Combine all these things, and it‚Äôs pretty obvious the whole thing had become purely political.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately it took me until Jan 2021 for the penny to drop. For me it was the initial variant talk and double masking. The whole narrative just fell apart. I realized that none of the dire predictions came true. Nobody was dropping dead in the streets. My elderly parents who live in Florida did not know a single person who even had COVID, much less died from it. </p>
<p>I did meet a couple of nurses last summer when I was on a trip to rural Illinois who told me what OP said - that hospitals are grossly over-counting COVID deaths because of the financial incentive. Unfortunately I didn't believe them at the time, but when everything else clicked I was like, oh fuck they were right.</p>

        <p>After stumbling upon a short television report about the 2009 Swine Flu  H1N1 pandemic from 3sat, one of the  educational/intellectual channels on German television. </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/HWaz9kK-ifs (engl subs)</p>
<p>That video was from 2010 and made my stomach turn upside down. I felt sick. Realizing the exact same tactic applied ten years later with Covid made me rethink everything.</p>
<p>That moment completely turned me around. The same day I revisited some arguments from supposed 'conspiracy theorist' doctors and professors (Prof Sucharit Bhakti, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, Dr. Claus C√∂hnlein etc) and saw their message in a completely different light. News reports seemed all of a sudden willful disinformation.</p>

        <p>Wow. Seeing that playbook, do you think the primary differentiator H1N1 vs covid is the complete societal adoption of social media adding speed and emotion to the spread of information and hysteria? Or the swine (vs beer! jk) element.. </p>

        <p>Yes , exactly. There was enough time for them to evaluate the failures of the last run, improve on their strategies, especially regarding speedy, powerful synced public communications (propaganda), in which the emerging social media platforms were one of the biggest wins. It's kind of obvious. </p>
<p>They label all as conspiracy theory, even when it's platently open, publicly avaible information. If you don't know it yet, watch this for an additional gut churning truth slap on the back of your head. The same guy, Dr. Marc van Ranst is again the leading pandemic manager in Belgium. He is obviously expert in public relations: </p>

<p>[Addmittingly I was one of the early 'frightend rabbits' and nearly lost my cool with people who didn't take it seriously. I felt threatened by the non-scared. That's why I can understand the mindset and emotions of both sides now. It is really scary, that my whole view just turned upside down from one moment on. Definitely triggered more interest into self reflection and mindfulness. Not aggressively holding on to views. Brutal honesty is the key factor. To admit to mistakes is hard but neccesary for growth.]</p>

        <p>100% empathize with that experience. I had some early breakdowns driven by fear and panic. I could not rationalize what was happening - much of the logic was breaking as the fear quickly notched down for me. But I wanted to believe we were doing the right thing. Thankfully I think I introspect too much and am receptive to being wrong. I see so many ppl who need this all to have been worth something. It‚Äôs easier for them to put shame on us for disavowing the many sacrifices we all made, simplified down to a mask or shot.</p>
<p>I appreciate your honesty and humility.</p>

        <p>Started with the universities in Canada all staying closed despite very little cases. Even though many US universities reopened (athough many closed again later). Then the BLM protests which was the exact opposite of what the governments told us to do during COVID. At this point I thought the shutdown was nessasary and masks work but there's more to it than what they told us. Then what really set it off was when I had to isolate when my friend got COVID despite us both wearing masks. That along with places doing second lockdowns (I thought that we'd do it once and then it would be good) really made me realize what was going on.</p>

        <p>- I first had the "aha" moment that the virus was a bad flu at best when the old people on the Diamond Princess survived in January/February (?). Also, the various exceptions that government people made for themselves early on (looking at you Whitmer and Pritzker)</p>
<p>- The first "aha" moment that there's something deeper at play with the lockdown policies was how quickly the media/companies/governments started releasing information/advertisements about the "new normal" in lockstep as early as February 2020. It seemed way too callous and over-eager given how much uncertainty the average joe had.</p>
<p>- When walmart and amazon were thriving but local stores were pressured to close / faced fines and nobody said anything screams regulatory capture.</p>
<p>- The political motivations (removing Trump, demoralizing non-woke people) became clear when BLM protests were not just tolerated but endorsed by healthcare people and people who were supposedly deathly afraid of spreading the virus. </p>
<p>- Regarding the vaccines, I first realized something fishy was up when the government agencies/businesses didn't immediately drop all the restrictions for vaccinated people and kept toying with the herd immunity (i.e. 70% -&rt; 85% and discounting natural immunity). It was then I realized there was something deeper at play (probably a mixture of $$ for boosters, introducing vaccine passports, and seeking to retain control/optics). Not only is this particularly nefarious, but had the actual goal been truly mass vaccination announcing the pandemic restrictions over (no mask, 100% reopened school/work) when an individual/state gets vaccinated would probably have been enough incentive to get to 70% or whatever vaccinated <a href="https://voluntarily.Now">voluntarily.</a> Now these people get to play Nazi with coercion and keep their hands on the lever to shift wealth/power to their connections. </p>
<p>-  In retrospect, the push from the start by the media/public-health regarding shutting down until a vaccine was probably at least somewhat manufactured.</p>

        <p>In March of last year a friend of mine told me that Covid had not come from a Chinese guy eating a bat, but was purposely engineered. Then I still believed what the news were saying about it: that it came from an infected animal in the Wuhan wet market. Now I recognize how ahead of the curve my friend was.</p>
<p>I started getting suspicious as blue states increasingly used Covid as an excuse to further sink their economies and weaken election integrity, and the Dems. in Congress turned it into one more political piece. The media invariably bashing every single thing that Trump said about it was a confirming sign that this was a scam.</p>

        <p>It was around late February and early March of 2020, so they started reporting the numbers, and then they started reporting the hospitals are being over flooded with patients. I'm like okay, this seems to be a legitimate problem. The media is then saying nurses, and doctors are on the brink exhaustion, tired, and are in a war zone at their respective hospitals, so certain choices were needed to be made. </p>
<p>In next to no time you had YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Instagram videos of nurses dancing it up in hospitals with well choreographed routines. Wait, what? Wait a second, the media reported that you nurses are on the brink of exhaustion, are overwhelmed with patients, tired and are in a war zone. How is it that these nurses found the time to do these dance routines in a "war zone" type environment? Then you had these nurses being interviewed on MSM syndicates, and sure enough, they didn't look not slightest bit of tired or exhausted as they claimed. </p>
<p>Don't believe me? Take a look at this playlist of dancing nurses I created on my YouTube channel and see for yourself: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6eRZv-FGdsc_WkURXquAOkBXZkmOeQEj">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6eRZv-FGdsc_WkURXquAOkBXZkmOeQEj</a></p>
<p>Here's the kicker, then you had the mainstream media reporting people dying of gun shot wounds, falling down the freaking stairs or ladder AND being counted as a COVID-19 death. How is that possible? So right then and there, I knew something was up because that is how you pad the numbers. Yet, questioning how they were counting COVID-19 deaths you were called a "conspiracy theorist" and how dare you question the government's policies on shutting down businesses. Did you know, people in hospice care were also counted as COVID-19 deaths? Did you know that?</p>
<p>Here's the kicker! In China, where this alleged virus originated from, by the end of March China was already re-opening their economy, flights were resuming, those make shift hospitals that they built within like a week to 10 days? Those make shift hospitals were closed and dismantled. With a population like China, if the real deal was happening, namely a pandemic, you would have seen people dropping like flies, as they alleged this to be a deadly virus like the Spanish Influenza pandemic after World War I. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, late February and early March of 2020 I knew something was up, I knew it was just a scam.</p>

        <p>Back in Jan 2020. I started recording the reported deaths and positive test. I was able to predict within a few the number of deaths a day in advance as well as infections within a few dozen from China. It was at that moment I knew China would never be honest. </p>

        <p>When a PhD friend of mine told me early on that the survival rate would be well over 99% based on his research. He said that it was being grossly over leveraged as a power grab.

        <p>Around April/May 2020 they were already mass-testing people with the PCR-tests, but weren‚Äôt able to make a study on antibody prevalence within the population? Huge red flag and the pandemic was over for me personally. Btw, until this day, our government was never interested in doing an antibody study to measure the immunity within the population. That‚Äôs when you know, this isn‚Äôt about our health.</p>

        <p>In January 2020 I made a public YouTube prediction that this was overblown media fear. As someone who works in marketing, I saw right through the nonsense. </p>
<p>By lockdown in March 2020, I had retained my skepticism. The infection fatality rate was only a bit higher than the flu.</p>
<p>The initial idea of a brief lockdown to slow the spread made me skeptical, and with all the fear mongering I was extra skeptical, but I conceded here when one person explained to me that if the hospitals were truly overwhelmed then it may prevent normal people from receiving medical care as usual (ie you get into an accident but no staff are available to scoop you up on the road). </p>
<p>After 2 weeks of lockdown I decided without a doubt that this was indeed media fear mongering, or that some conspiracy was true. I still am not sure what the truth is (ie fear mongering or lab leak or bio weapon and economic warfare) but it‚Äôs abundantly clear that the mainstream narrative is wrong. </p>
<p>I realized this because my own family suffered greatly, and by the way, one of my parents is a nurse. The hospital was empty, but to make matters worse speaking out would have one fired and silenced off of social media. </p>
<p>Furthermore important operations like cancer treatments were totally cancelled, which to anyone should raise massive red flags. </p>
<p>By June of 2020 it should‚Äôve been abundantly clear to EVERYONE that lockdown was NOT the answer. You know what happened in summer of 2020. Massive protests were allowed yet a small get together with friends would kill grandma? </p>
<p>The propaganda is blatantly obvious. I would‚Äôve thought that the world would wake up by now yet here we are another year later and still people actually believe we need lockdowns and to vaccinate everyone.</p>

        <p>Hit home here, it‚Äôs been terrible in nursing homes the lockdowns probably causing more problems that good, my poor residents are just the last 2 months getting in person visits and dinning room meals together. I think it‚Äôs even worse than the potential of getting fired for speaking out, when the government puts out a mandate then does random surveys with monetary and admission penalties ultimately risk of being shutdown and then everyone is out of a job, home etc. makes us stuck between a rock and a hard spot of epic proportions. All it takes is one covid lemming to report us for not doing what cdc, hhs, cms recommend and they‚Äôd be in to cite us. We are standing firm on not requiring the vaccine... for now I fear it might not be long before I have to choose between my job or the jab üòî</p>

        <p>In November 2019, girlfriend was sick. Pneumonia came back negative, no flu, basically couldn't figure it out but gave her steroids and something else (I can't remember.) She recovered fully in a few weeks but had a difficult time breathing for maybe a day or two in the beginning but not life threatening. I'd consider her healthy physically and mentally.</p>
<p>I got sick in Dec. of 2019. Runny nose Saturday night (went to my home town as my grandma passed away). Sunday I'm driving back and feel really uncomfortable, and by the time I get home I was out. Out out. I rarely get sick. I text my cousin who is a doctor that said the flu was weird that year and wasn't the usual symptoms. Suggested to get a flu test. Got a flu test, came back negative. I could barely walk to the bathroom without being exhausted for first few days. OTC meds, sleep, I feel better in about week and back to normal in a month or so. I also had a sinus infection so that cleared up after antibiotics. I really didn't think much of it other than I haven't ever felt like that in my life. I'm on HRT and daily supplements including 15k IU of D and get my blood checked every 6 months. Would rather not list all of my supplements and dosages for time sake. I consider myself healthy physically and mentally. </p>
<p>Once things slowly started to trickle in about Covid, China/WHO saying no human to human transmission but cases were going up (how is that possible?), then sheer panic from everyone once things started to shut down. I thought back to when we were sick and assumed it's obviously been around longer than that (no, I can't confirm it was Covid, but it wasn't the flu). The shutdown was the moment. November to March(?) and now we panic and stay inside? If I remember right, the reproductive number at the time was high, and if you added it up since November, everyone would of had the chance to catch it. No one knows how long it was here before we "tested" for it. The original strain was not good but I don't think it warranted a shutdown. This is even assuming it was the first strain. <strong>Granted, this is just my opinion.</strong></p>
<p>I did get a sore throat and runny nose for a few days about a month ago after I traveled. I also assume that was the delta because who gets a cold during the summer?</p>

        <p>When California extended the two week shutdown to two more weeks. Which then turned into something else entirely.</p>
<p>But during that first two week round, it became extremely clear to me and many others that the severity wasn't as bad as they said. And when I tried to bring it up to people, that was completely shutdown.  No one was happy or relieved. They only wanted to see the worst thing possible to happen.</p>
<p>That's when it flipped for me. I didn't know what to think of the shutdowns at first, and it was super naive of me to think even in those two weeks we could have had ANY impact on a damn virus.</p>
<p>But yeah. When public health officials and local politicians were almost bummed that it wasn't as bad as it might have been, that's what did it for me.</p>

        <p>Early June, 2020.  When the rules put in place to prevent spread of the disease were overlooked by huge crowds, so they could protest injustice across America.  Major media outlets lost their focus on the pandemic and started to discuss ‚Äúrace‚Äù again, like they had done so many years ago.  </p>
<p>I knew then, that the entire agenda was to unseat Trump.  Health? Safety?  BS.  It was all done, in the US, to change the political landscape.  I mentally checked out.  And that‚Äôs when home prices started accelerating as well, as people wanted out of big cities, away from the madness.  I decided to move from my own big city, got a premium for the sale of my home (suburb), and moved to the beach.  In Florida, which may be one of the last places of true freedom in America.  Even with all of Florida‚Äôs warts, which are likely genital.üòÑ</p>

        <p>When they started to tell us to stay home, wear masks, no indoor gatherings via tv, radio, roadside billboards. They shut down small businesses, gyms, restaurants, but allowed Walmart and Costco to stay open. Kept our large mall open on boxing day (it was packed). Allowed large protests. Restauraunts must take contact information, but walmart and costco don't have to.</p>
<p>They threatened people with fines for having even 1 person over at our homes. They even had a snitch phone line to report your neighbours.</p>

        <p>About after the first month when I reflected on how much of a joke the social distancing policies, lockdowns and 0 effort from the medical community providing information on to lead a healthy lifestyle and boost natural immunity.</p>
<p>I tested 'positive' and the only time I was sick last year was a mild cold for about a day and a half. The goalposts kept moving further and further away, the election, virologists being silenced. I can go on and on. Not to mention the fact that we STILL aren't out of this and we went from 2 weeks to flatten the curve, to government employees showing up on your doorstep to encourage you to take an experimental jab.</p>

        <p>Sat in my business about week 2 so late March early April.  My business partner was there with me...I said  to him " this is a coup, this is being done to get him out of office." Mind you I still had some fear of the disease itself but I knew something else was up. He looks at me and says "dude im being nice right now and I'm not gonna tell you you're full of shit" I tell you want about a month or two later he was on board and started seeing all the bullshit.

        <p>Great question. I think it all started when I vastly overestimated my intelligence and importance because of the chip on my shoulder from never fulfilling my own expectations of myself. Either that or without a personal reference point for oppression and a low level of emotional intelligence I automatically assume that any inconvenience I experience is a conspiracy, fascism come-to-roost, a personal assault on me, or some combination therein. That's why I have the unabashed gall to make references to the Holocaust when someone asks me to even for a moment consider other people.</p>

        <p>Yes obviously my post clearly referenced the Holocaust and that covid inconvenienced me personally...typical covid lemming, you provide nothing useful to the conversation. Since your unable to dispute any of our claims you resort to name calling and using language to try and make your self sound smart. You are probably have some useless degree that makes you feel intellectually superior to people, but at the same time your angry because you don‚Äôt actually understand the flaws in the ‚Äúscience‚Äù behind this disease. Best of luck to you</p>
