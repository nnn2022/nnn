    <strong>I think we have to accept that some of those closest to us might as well be our enemies.</strong>
    <p><p>Think about it. In every apocalyptic scenerio when the earth is going to shit, you always have those people who naively trust clueless and/or authoritarian governments to save them when the best option would be to go your own way.</p>
<p>If the lockdown situation doesn't resolve soon, I think some people will have no choice but to break off from their families. It's already been happening for years. Before, people had to put up with shitty family members because of necessity and social shaming. Thankfully when more work became available a lot of people could leave. </p>
<p>With covid a lot of people are finally realising just how selfish and narcissistic their blood relatives are. In my case the insanity and selfishness has only become more concentrated. I don't care if you're related by blood, if someone calls YOU selfish for prioritising your mental health, your physical health, your education and your future over the lives of a few vulnerable people who could be saved by more competent government decisions, you have the right to cut them out of your life.</p></p>

        <p>For me, it's been certain friends.   Two friends cut me out of their lives because I'm living my life as normal and they're still living like it's march.  It was no big loss though because they are horrible people.   They threw away every principle they ever had because they were scared for themselves but hid it behind concern for others. For example, "we're such good people for wanting to save lives that it's not important to care about mental health, other diseases,the environment, local business, education, poverty, world hunger, because covid is the most serious issue in the world right now and anyone suffering or dying from anything else is just selfish."  I knew that I would never unsee that side of them and that they would gaslight the fuck out of me after this had all passed.  I was getting ready to cut them out when they went ahead and did me the favor of doing it first.  Even though we have mutual friends, I'm also secure that I'll never run into them because they had made a vow to never leave their house  for anything non essential until covid is wiped from the earth. My actual family has been great though.  Everyone but my brother is on my level.  He is a severe hypochondriac and has an anxiety disorder so I never expected anything else from him.  He also acknowledges that these are his issues and knows that I'm living normally.  He doesn't expect me not to and never covid bingos me for being me.</p>

        <p>Same. It's always been the data telling me this is a hoax. I don't get my info from MSM long before covid came along so right away I was made aware that we were being lied to on an epic scale.</p>
<p>For instance, the amount of deaths globally is actually considerably lower this year than it was in 2019 and 2018 in spite of this "global pandemic"</p>
<p>656,000 flu deaths last year and I don't remember anyone even making a peep about it. There is no logic to people's fear, that alone tells me its a hoax.</p>

        <p>Actually there are 200k additional deaths this year from all causes in the us alone.  Fox news is MSM, not "data".  The data clearly show a huge spike in overall mortality this year.  Wonder what that could be from....</p>

        <p>The rules for labeling a death a ‚Äúcovid‚Äù death have been generous: </p>
<ul>
<li>died and suspected covid (not proven) </li>
<li>died with covid </li>
<li>died of any cause after testing positive for covid within a certain period (eg test positive for covid and then get shot in the head 3 weeks later and die = covid death; see: Seattle) </li>
</ul>
<p>On top of this, hospitals have a significant incentive to identify covid cases - they get a lot of money for them. </p>
<p>Between the financial incentive and the generous rules for what constitutes a covid death, the idea that covid deaths have been <em>under</em> counted strains credulity. This is strengthened by the fact that politicians are naturally self-motivated (re-election matters): in light of opposition to lockdowns, it is in their personal best interest to have high covid death counts so that they have a compelling justification for their lockdowns. This aspect exists in virtually every state that has imposed lockdowns at all, and it is true of ALL states that are currently under severe lockdowns today. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, from the very beginning of lockdowns, medical experts and economists warned that lockdowns would come with a death toll: </p>
<ul>
<li>increased suicides </li>
<li>increased overdoses </li>
<li>untreated heart attacks and strokes </li>
<li>undiagnosed and therefore untreated cancers (delays in treatment can turn a 90% survival rate into a 90% death rate)</li>
<li>widespread starvation </li>
<li>increased violent crime (including crime resulting in death)</li>
<li>severe illnesses directly caused by delayed treatment for minor illnesses </li>
</ul>
<p>The evidence shows that ALL of these predictions have come to pass - plus others, like an increase in stillbirths as mothers miss proper prenatal care. </p>
<p>Given the generous rules for adding ‚Äúcovid‚Äù deaths and the strong incentives to label patients/deaths covid deaths, and the predicted and <em>proven</em> death toll of lockdowns, which is the more likely explanation for the excess deaths (beyond those officially counted as covid deaths) this year? </p>
<p>COVID or the many needless deaths due to other causes that were predicted and have in fact been documented?</p>

        <p>What more readily explains 200k deaths, an increase in stillbirths/ suicides or a novel virus that is tearing through the entire planet?   The virus you numpty.  And the virus deaths ARE undercounted as people with COVID go untreated as you claim heart attack victims are.  No treatment = no test = not counted as a COVID death.</p>

<p>They are in their late 60s and very fit / healthy.  </p>

        <p>In my experience even though most of my family disagrees with me they aren't angry at me for feeling the way I do, nor am I angry at them.  If there are absolutely toxic people in your life and for your mental health you need to cut them out, then do so.  But also if they aren't complete pieces of shit maybe just try to deal with how they feel. Try to communicate a different viewpoint in a respectful way that isn't just my team VS your team.</p>
<p>I think what this world needs is a lot more respectful conversation between people with different viewpoints and less anger towards them. Especially for family but yes it's possible for family members to really not act like family.</p>
<p>Try to take the high road and maybe don't confront people if you know it will be like talking to a wall.  Maybe don't bring this topic up and one day they might come around.  I really don't get angry at people for feeling the way they do.  This is a very confusing world to navigate and the propaganda is coming at us from all angles.  For me family is the most important and will always be deserving of another chance, they've done the same for me.</p>
