    <strong>My experience so far</strong>
    <p><p>I was deployed last year when COVID began. The base I was stationed at was pretty good as far as deployed locations go. Lots of different restaurants, a few gyms, and it was within an easy drive of some really big cities. When everything happened, they took all that away from us. No more leaving the base. Gym capacity was slashed to the point where it wasn‚Äôt even worth it to go unless you liked waiting 2 hours for the guys in front of you to finish their workout. All the restaurants closed, making the chow hall the only option for food. Masks 24/7 unless you were laying in your own bunk. I thought ‚ÄúWow this must be pretty serious stuff‚Äù.</p>
<p>Then I started noticing things. At the chow hall you had to distance 6 feet while waiting in line, but then you‚Äôd get your food and sit down at a table with 100 other guys. What good did the distancing do? They closed the sandwich bar, but kept the salad bar open. Why? Is the virus afraid of lettuce? Gym capacity was slashed, but you could do group PT outside and nobody would bother you. Does the virus only live in gyms?</p>
<p>The masks were my favorite bit of nonsense. The military encouraged us to make them out of whatever fabric we could find. I wore a Tee shirt mask for a while, then I realized that nobody ever specified how thick the material had to be, so I made a new one out of sheer pantyhose. If this virus is supposed to be so lethal, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be issuing us medical grade masks and making us dispose of them daily in an incinerator or something.</p>
<p>Then I came back home and I quickly realized that (at least where I live) nobody cares if you‚Äôre wearing a mask or not. Walmart had a 16 year old guarding the door to ask you to put one on, but you could literally just ignore his existence and there were no consequences whatsoever. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have a police officer at every door to enforce masks if this shit was so scary.</p>
<p>Then the governor issued a curfew and the local sheriff straight up posted on Facebook that no law enforcement officer would be enforcing it. Lmfao</p>
<p>Finally the big day came. I got tested and they told me I had the dreaded Rona. I got a free 2 weeks off work and absolutely nothing bad happened to me whatsoever. Thanks COVID!</p>
<p>Now the vaccines are out and they‚Äôre running off the honor system. If a super deadly pandemic were ravaging the world, I feel like there would be a stronger system of verification than little cards that anyone with a printer can fake lol.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve lived the past year and a half effectively ignoring this BS. This virus is a joke</p></p>

        <p>I actually died from Covid last year.. So you are one of the lucky ones.</p>
<p>Covid is super deadly, and I know from first hand experience, because I'm dead.  Oh, I also voted for Biden a couple of times because I'm black, and I think he's doing an amazing job so far.</p>

        <p>Dude this is literally my exact story. Deployed end of ‚Äò19- mid ‚Äò20. They took everything and even delayed our return. Then I got home to a nice 14 day ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù I like to call it free leave. Then got to start my R&amp;R. No one here cares about the masks or anything. Even at work most of the ppl were massless unless leadership was around.</p>

        <p>I only had a sore throat when I tested positive dor the rona. My wife tested negative after I tested positive and she hasn‚Äôt been sick at all. I did get to enjoy 2 weeks of paid vacation from work which was nice. </p>
<p>In the beginning, there was all this fear that everyone was gonna die from this new deadly virus. I thought it was gonna be similar to the last of us video game where the world because apocalyptic. I kind of wanted to experience it because I think it would be fun, but I know it would actually be terrible. As time went by, especially after 2 weeks to flatten the curve turned to 2 months, I realized that all this shit is just a fucking joke. It‚Äôs made me become very disappointed in humanity and realize how easily people are manipulated.</p>

<p>Then a friend out of the state got it and called me after recovering. He said that it was like a mildly bad cold and that "we've been scammed".</p>
