    <strong>A $26 Billion Settlement was just announced for opioid deaths, overdoses, and addictions. Why am I supposed to trust Big Pharma again? Tell me again how "safe and effective" their medicine is.</strong>
    <p><p>The same mega giant forcing vaccines down our throats and the same doctors that prescribed these medications that killed, injured, and created life long addictions for many people, are paying out more money than we can even imagine for these atrocities. For marketing a drug they didn't study hard enough that then killed millions. </p>
<p>How can people see things like this, and of course J&amp;J is part of the lawsuit, and still trust these people? Do you want to go tell the grieving families of these dead, overdosed patients that they are so courageous for being part of a human trial of this drugs effects? Would you have a shining smile on your face as you said what a great job they did trusting their doctors for this safe and effective medication they wouldn't know would kill people till years later? How many lives will all of this cost until we stop playing god? More people died from opioids than covid! And it was all at the hands of these same experts and doctors. Like are dormers really that capable of mental gymnastics they can't put these things together? Or is it just plain stupidity and ignorance?</p></p>

        <p>Big pharma destroyed communities in the USA. When I was an animal shelter volunteer,  I had to make statements before the county council, to support the humane society. During a session, I witnessed the county mayor asking the council for support to engage litigation against big pharma, as communities in East Tennessee were devastated by the big pharma opioid epidemic.</p>

        <p>Big pharma is evil don’t get me wrong but to point the finger directly at them exclusively is a  simple but faulty solution.  </p>
<p>There are so many more factors involved in drug addiction than simply the manufacturer.  This is a economic, social, psychological, and spiritual crisis as well as a regulation one.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of other drug examples that pharma has pushed that are pretty deadly too.   </p>
<p>You are 100% right though - there’s no reason to trust them or the government anymore.  This is the fall of a civilization for sure</p>
