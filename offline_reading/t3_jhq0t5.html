    <strong>I had a genuine question for all of you</strong>
    <p><p>What is it that makes you think..  What, corona doesnt exist? Or that masks are bad? I mean, i get disagreeing with some of the measures taken, i fully agree that lockdowns for example are stupid, but cmon, masks? Costs you more or less nothing, and it might just protect you or someone else from catching it. And sure, the morality rate is relatively low (probably 1-2% really), but even the mild version is a pain in the ass to deal with.</p></p>

        <p>Touching your face is bad. In preschool you were taught to cough into your elbow. The mask I believe has more bacteria and growth vs. people washing their hands with basic hygiene. And the fact people are beating each other in the streets over a piece of cloth.</p>

        <p>I think many agree that it does, that there is a virus with an estimated IFR of <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19">between 0.5 and 1%</a>.</p>
<p>The question for me, why what most of the world is doing makes no sense, is that there's no end game to it. Do people expect to sit at home and wait until a vaccine - which everyone will of course take and which will be completely safe yet effective - fixes everything?</p>
<p>At some point the actions you take to try and delay things are worse than the disease. It would make sense to me if you had short term restrictions while you hurry to build emergency hospitals, or made sure that necessary infrastructure was in place. Instead what we're seeing is lockdowns being seen as a <em>cure</em>, buying time to do nothing. Even the WHO has repeatedly said that it doesn't work that way. Locking down society will not make the virus go away. And now people are talking about closing schools until 2022. Wearing your mask will not eliminate the virus, it will only slow the spread in the large scale. Again, what are you doing with the time you're buying?</p>
<p>I live in Sweden, and the way it's currently being handled here seems to work, without infringing too much on personal liberties, without extralegal actions being taken <em>for public safety</em> and without all of the stupid political aspects of everything that I see in the US. What happened in the care homes in spring was a tragedy, but to be honest, things had been horrible in Swedish elder care for decades. This just showed it more directly.</p>
<p>Besides from all of this there is also a fear that even after the virus situation is over, things will not return to normal. It's been shown that if a government wants to force you to stay home, shut up, close your business and do what you're told, they can. Even if the reason may have been sane, next time it doesn't have to be, and the mechanisms are already in place and proven to work. It doesn't even have to be strictly legal and people will do the enforcement for you.</p>
<p>This is just my take on it. I'm sure there are others.</p>

        <p>More or less nothing, eh?  I'm not inside anyone else's head, so let's put the rest of the world aside for a moment and focus on me.  I'm autistic.  A lifetime of interpreting facial signals and expressions has left me really, really good at it.  It still takes a lot of focus and effort for me to do what normal folks do effortlessly and instantaneously, but I can do it- or I could.  With the bottom two thirds of your face obstructed, I can no more figure you out than I can read the language of Martian Rockhumper.  And it's not just reading emotions; I can't tell what ANYTHING you're doing means.  The words disintegrate into sludge, and I can't tell if you're threatening to shoot me or just saying hi.  Every conversation I have with a masked human that I can't walk away from is a panic attack waiting to happen.   </p>
<p>But that's just me.  Even with the most liberal definitions and estimations of autism, we're still less than 4% of the population.  Most of us don't react the way I do, most of those aren't as severe, and most of <em>those</em> are pretty much hermits anyway.  I'm a rare case among rare cases, and I don't think it's fair to expect the world to restructure itself to accommodate me (a lesson the pro-maskers would do well to learn).</p>
<p>Now, let's look past just me.  What is the problem with wearing masks, you ask.  They slow the spread of the disease.  Yes- <em>and that's exactly the problem.</em>  This is not Ebola or Polio or the Black Death.  You can't hide and wait for it to go away; it'll still be there when you come back out.  The only way through it is herd immunity: let the young and strong catch it and get over it, so the vulnerable have a smaller chance of exposure.  Mask-wearing makes the lockdowns longer, because it slows the spread.  If you object to the lockdowns, you should object to the masks.  Every shuttered business, every shattered life, every new addiction and undiagnosed cancer and despair-driven suicide is visible in those thrice-damned pieces of cloth.  Don't shoot me in the the knee and tell me it doesn't matter because it "costs you more or less nothing".</p>

        <p>You forgot one crucial detail - slowing the spread is important because otherwise hospitals will get full, in my country (Poland) we're already running out of ICU beds and respirators, the doctors are getting sick (even 'mild' Corona makes them unable to work for two weeks), and people who dont even have corona but are otherwise sick might be dying because of that. Cancer treatments and operations, for example are being delayed due to just the sheer fact that the nurses and doctors are too busy from covid patients.</p>

        <p>I didn't forget it, it just didn't happen.  Hospitals typically run at about 85% capacity; they get overfilled whenever a bug that requires hospitalization goes around.  I suppose it might be different in Poland, but the basic nature of capitalism suggests otherwise.  Now, there's a difference between "over capacity" and "people dying on the floors", but that didn't happen anywhere.  The fear was that it would, but the hospitals stayed inaccessible for many- many who have lost six or seven months, and with many cancers, that's life and death.  It wasn't the disease that did that, it was the shutdowns.  And if the only argument is that shutting down saves the lives of people who die because of the shutdowns, that's pretty damn self-defeating.</p>

        <p>When people cough or sneeze, their droplets might land on your mask. Then you take off the mask without washing your hands and you touch your face a lot. Most masks are ineffective and they haven’t “flattened the curve”. I think masks either make 0 difference or are worse than no mask</p>

        <p>Masks make it harder to breathe and trap bacteria on your face all day. Not good for public health. Cloth masks at least, surgical masks are much better but they’re disposable so you always need new ones. Worth it in my opinion because I hate cloth masks. Not to mention the entire mask hysteria is total insanity</p>

        <p>I’m not against wearing masks in general. I don’t think it should be mandatory though especially when most people don’t have good masks. It’s actually more unsanitary, touching it constantly taking it on and off, washing it with your socks and underwear... yuck. Btw I wear masks everywhere I’m required to but I use surgical masks.</p>

        <p>I don't think <strong>anyone</strong> here would claim that Corona doesn't exist.. And if they do, they're obviously insane. And most of us have no issue with people voluntarily wearing masks.</p>
<p>I would even wager that the overwhelming majority of us wouldn't mind the government spending significant amounts of money on campaigns to popularize the use of masks. It's when it tips over into mandates and laws and fines and forced closures when we have a problem.</p>

        <p>Honestly, yeah that's fair enough, i just wanted to ask, because i know that there are a lot of ,as you said, insane people who legitimately think COVID doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>Well I could be wrong but honestly I would be very surprised if even 1% in the anti lockdown camp thinks covid doesn't exist or even if 1% thinks it's harmless! I mean.. The evidence of its existence and its ability to cause health complications is overwhelming after all. There are some who think the Chinese made it in a lab though, and lots who go on about the new world order and bill gates and the great reset and all that..</p>
<p>But what unites us is not so much our view of the virus or masks, but the belief that, at this point, the lockdown measures have consequences that are worse than the disease itself.</p>

        <p>I mean yeah that last thing is true. I Just wanted to know whether the people here are in that rational i guess 'section' of "the lockdown went too far" or if you're conspiracy nuts or something. Well, glad that you're mostly the former.</p>

        <p>&rt;corona doesnt exist?</p>
<p>No one here thinks that.</p>
<p>&rt;Or that masks are bad?</p>
<p>Not bad, just unecessary, and that mask mandates shouldn't be in place.</p>
<p>&rt;Costs you more or less nothing</p>
<p>Not at all about cost.</p>
<p>&rt;might just protect you or someone else from catching it</p>
<p>"might". Would you be cool with changing the speed limit to 10mph im order to maybe, possibly, sorta saving someone from harm? And hey, I could understand wanting to wear a mask to protect yourself or others if this virus was the cancer spreading through the air like the media and many other people are acting like it is. But it isn't.</p>
<p>&rt;a pain in the ass to deal with</p>
<p>So we're slaughtering our economy, harming our youth's education, and causing record amount of mental health issues and cases of abuse, all for a "pain in the ass"?</p>
<p>It all comes down to if someone is that afraid of this (weak as fuck) virus, then they can "Stay. The fuck. Home." and take whatever precautions they need to in order to feel safe, right? As opposed to forcing their fear and paranoia onto everyone else.</p>

        <p>That's fair but<br>
-Alright, was just asking beacuse those people do exist  </p>
<p>-Mandates i guess, but also not unnescessary, they do help  </p>
<p>- Not about cost? What is it about then? (I dont mean monetary cost, just, overall "cost" of wearing a mask, that includes the very mild inconvenience  </p>
<p>-The virus *does* spread through the air, because i know people who know when/where they got sick, and they weren't in direct contact with that person, only *close*  </p>
<p>-A pain in the ass to deal with *for most*, and lethal to *a small minority*<br>
, but yeah that's fair enough, some measures taken "for our safety" and all that have definitely gone too far.</p>
