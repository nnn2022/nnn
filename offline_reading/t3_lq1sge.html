    <strong>It's amazing</strong>
    <p><p>This sub continues to not get shut down or infiltrated by crazy mods.  (Enjoy it while we can)</p>
<p>Keep it up guys.....seriously......this sub has restored my faith in humanity and given me a sense of sanity.  </p>
<p>I have rabid family members in Florida that won't go outside and God forbid if you don't wear a mask.  The weird thing is they are fairly intelligent people.  (or so I thought).  </p>
<p>I guess fear has gripped them into a fantasy of death to a virus that has a 97%+ survival rate.  Notice I said they live in Florida?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></p>

        <p>This place is like the origin of other alternative thought sites. They want to watch it and gauge it for now. Once it becomes useless to them expect it. The fbi is on /pol/ all the time. We message them and make fun of them but truth be told.. we can do stuff quicker and easier on there. We don’t need warrants. Example enclosed ~~&rt; https://imgur.com/a/rGEncG0 this would have taken them weeks and warrants. The Portland bomber was caught in just hours. His grandma even thanked /pol/ for not letting him go on the run.</p>

        <p>Don’t we have a discord? I vaguely remember people mentioning it. Maybe I’m thinking of another sub. But if all else fails we can probably just migrate to r/coronaviruscirclejerk</p>

        <p>I don’t think intelligence has much to do with this. I wondered the same thing , how could “smart” people fall for this? Now I’ve realized that people with advanced degrees seem to be more susceptible to this for some reason. I don’t know why, maybe it’s because they want to be part of the larger group of experts and smart people? It’s also a personality thing, some people are just not the questioning type. I have always had lots of questions about everything to an annoying degree. I just like having a deep understanding of things, it’s not enough for me to just listen to something and believe it without knowing the background of it all and being able to fill in the gaps.</p>

        <p>Yep.  It's always team A vs Team B and no real conversation.</p>
<p>As if asking questions is now a platform for the "ignorant".  IT'S SETTLED they say.</p>
<p>So I just ask basic questions and they just can't answer them without getting mad.  My family should know better......they know I'm sure as hell not getting the mRNA vax bullshit.......and they act like I'm some plague ridden zombie when I tell them that.  We're now one year into 2 weeks to flatten the curve.</p>

        <p>Intelligence doesn't have anything to do with it.
I have a degree and I read a lot, took a lot of courses outside my degree as well - and I'm questioning the situation we're in.
But I know a few people who also have degrees and yet they blindly believe everything the media/government is saying.</p>
<p>I guess it's just how our brains work. Some people are skeptical, others aren't.</p>
