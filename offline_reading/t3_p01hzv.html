    <strong>I won’t give up</strong>
    <p><p>There are many layers to digest when referring to King Bach's career, looking at his vine to youtube transformation, as well as his acting and singing career. However, I do believe that one element to King Bachs evolved humor is the vine 'Funny Vine - "Just a spoonful"</p>
<p>The pure raw essence of this video highlights the comedic genius behind King Bach's work, similar to the comedy of Jim Carrey and other famous comedic actors. Not only on a comedy side, but you can also look at the directing of this video. The way the camera pans back and forth between the 2 characters, highlights that the audience are focusing on just these 2 people. The build-up of tension between the 'back and forth' camera switches only goes to show the genius of Bach's directing, again, comparing to the likes of Kubrick and Tarintino.</p>
<p>The video starts off, with Bach (highlighting him as the main character), asking his friend for 'some ice cream', with no indication in his face or actions with what's about to happen next. In response, character number 2 says 'only a spoonful'. This is where the genius kicks in</p>
<p>Bachs' response to his statement is by pulling out a silver metal spoon, of unorthodox size compared to typical spoons you would find in a household. The unexpectedness of this spoon is what makes it so hilarious. Character number 2 is obviously shown to have no clue that when Bach asked for a spoonful, he would be pulling out a spoon of much larger size, nearly double him. This approach to comedy is one of the most initiative things to come out of the 21st century. Although the spoon is comically large, it still is technically a "spoonful", meaning he can enjoy the ice cream to a much larger extent, as the said scoop will be much larger.</p>
<p>The spoon brings a shock factor to the audience, as well as a barrel of laughs. Bachs' approach to comedy should be recognized for decades to come</p></p>
