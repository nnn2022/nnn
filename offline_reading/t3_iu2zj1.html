    <strong>The amount of people wearing masks outside and around absolutely nobody is mind boggling.</strong>
    <p><p>Just came back from upstate NY and the amount of people walking around in nature wearing a mask was baffling. </p>
<p>I felt like I was in the twilight zone at one point when I saw people on bikes and running while wearing masks.</p></p>

        <p>the fact people will also wear the muzzle alone in a car proves its psychological and not medical, of course they would argue otherwise.</p>

        <p>I think I can explain their train of thought.</p>
<p>So if you're in an actual risky situation that requires masks and a high degree of caution (for example an isolation room with someone who may be suspected to have TB) you do not remove the mask and then put it back on. People taught by the media and Fauci who are absolutely frightened about corona who are going to two places probably believe they cant take the mask off and then back on without contaminating themselves so they wait until they're done with all trips and can toss the mask at home.</p>
<p>The problem is, besides the fact that corona won't even be noticed in much of the population, non n95 masks do jack shit to prevent you from catching it from someone else. Even the N95 has limited effectiveness against small viruses like this, and those are fit tested for the nurse or doctor (they work much better for bacteria) So yeah thats where I believe they get the idea to wear it in the car.</p>

        <p>I also saw someone say that masks need to be left on until you can get home and wash them and shower because you don't know if the particles are on there or not. Like I thought masks were to protect others, not you?? Makes me laugh</p>

        <p>I think you hit the nail on the head. I was there. Back in the first weeks of covid I was with the doomer/prepper/fucktheCCP crowd in r/wuhan_flu. I washed my hands all the time. Probably like 20 times a day.  </p>
<p>I remember having to drive back to campus in the onset of the lockdowns to move my stuff out of my dorm for the semester. I was paranoid as FUCK. I was sprinting across campus and avoiding literally everyone (everyone was so nonchalant and I was flipping out. Now it's reversed lol).</p>

        <p>I work with mentally ill individuals who I assist by transporting in my car and providing therapy. I wear my mask until I get home because I feel better about it with them being in my car. Some cannot wear a mask for developmental reasons or anxiety reasons and I feel safer keeping my mask on until I get out of my car in situations like those. It’s not harming anyone and I feel like I’m making the right choice for my clients and their families. When going to the grocery store, I rip that shit off right when I get to my car.</p>

        <p>I’ve heard people explain doing this because they interpreted local mask ordinances very literally and say “a mask must be on at any time outside of your house.” So they wear one in their own yard, their own car, to get the mail, etc. These are the people who would stand on one foot and quack like a duck at 3PM everyday if a government mandate told them to. Whether people were around to make sure they were doing it or not. </p>
<p>I think these people also lack a general understanding of biology and they think this virus is like radiation just sitting in the air outside and their mask is their shield. (Nevermind how/why it wouldn’t also be in their house then if they think that).</p>

        <p>People just don’t pay attention. They don’t even understand the rules theyre told to follow, they just do it.</p>
<p>Mask mandate in my state says kids under ten don’t need to wear one in public indoor spaces. Just found out my sister has been making her three and five year old wear masks whenever they go to the grocery store, because she didn’t even bother reading up on the mandate first.</p>

        <p>That’s also true. The rules in my state say a baby under 2 should never ever be wearing a mask and I see them on babies all the time.</p>
<p>Our mask mandate also says masks need only be worn in indoor public spaces or waiting to use public transportation services (even if outside). No mandate about wearing masks outside in general or on hiking trails and shit but that hasn’t stopped people flipping out about it.</p>

        <p>That reminds me of this friend in college who called me at night. He told me to come down to the radio office because I was pulled out of a hat as the student to win a hundred dollars. I was still baffled why I didn't realize he had a side gig at the radio station. So I go down there of course as soon as I leave the dorm I hear giggling from the bushes. I don't remember if I got him back for that.</p>

        <p>There are two kinds of people in this world: those who use performative obedience to signal their moral superiority and those who don't. Deep down, they can't possibly think strapping a random piece of cloth and elastic they found on Etsy to their faces truly does anything to protect anyone, right?  It all has to be for show.</p>

        <p>There's lots of convincing science. Animations showing spittle droplets landing back on your face instead of dispersing into the surroundings for example. And they're not obeying, they are doing a ~~hecking~~ willing sacrifice.</p>
<p>We aren't obeying the government... we are obeying a moral obligation. Everything one does to separate or distinguish themselves is evil (egoism). However, wholesome things such as giving yourself up and into the flow of a worldwide social media hype is by definition good. Because unity.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they are useless. That "science" couldn't possibly account for actual dynamics of spread (just try to grasp that with your mind, literal billions of people moving around and interacting in all sorts of ways). </p>
<p>But, I recognize that I'm driven by personal biases here (really dislike being treaded on), so maybe this skews my view too much and actually the doomers are right about the deadly covid. Also about Trump. It's funny enough that both sides seem to be accusing each other of the same crimes... no examples but it's obvious. Or calling the other side "Karens" for example.</p>

        <p>These are the same people who say something like “I go the speed limit therefore I’m good driver.” And they don’t understand road interactions, putting on a signal before hitting their brakes, anticipating other’s movements, merging at speed, and other nuances of being a good driver. </p>
<p>“I wear a mask therefore I’m keeping others safe.” No additional thought goes into it. No one around them at all, but they think they’re keeping others safe with a mask on. Mind boggling.</p>

        <p>So I live in the UK and tend to match the speed limit, unless I am driving on a motorway (freeway) where the road is relatively empty and safe then I might go up to 80mph (limit is 70). Let me tell you there are plenty of people driving below the speed limits in the wrong lanes, those who hover just under it or who slow down to 60 for every speed camera can make driving on the motorway a chore. Especially when 3 lanes are filled with these people and you have to pull across each in turn to overtake. Or you have the same situation as described passing on the right, (although it's the left here) and people freaking the hell out because "you're not supposed to do that" even when you have not changed lanes and they're in the incorrect lane, "move over if it's free" being common courtesy and the law (I believe).</p>

        <p>If it was actually a deadly virus as they claim, people would automatically isolate themselves and take all the precautions.</p>
<p>The amount of media and political involvement tells us otherwise. They had to *push* the narrative.</p>
<p>Goals of the Elites:</p>
<p>-Divide people to get them away from focusing on the real issues</p>
<p>-Make everyone turn against each other. Global warming versus those that are against it, Liberal versus Republican, Race issues, Rich vs. Poor, Covid-19 paranoia versus Realists.</p>
<p>Previous issues never got people polarized as covid-19 was. This is their most successful concoction yet. Nebulous science, lies every sentence, paranoid population, professionals(nurses/doctors/scientists) without conscience describes every aspect of 2020.</p>

        <p>That is an excellent enumeration of the divisive rhetoric and means that they used to polarize this issue.  The only issue I would add is the complete gaslighting:  telling us that "now we learned new data about masks that really do suggest you could possibly save grandma's life if you wore them while jogging", meanwhile they refuse to learn new data about the actual risks of the virus itself.  </p>
<p>I shit you not, half the people I talk to still think 3-5% of COVID infected are going to die, and that it amounts to 7 million people in the population.</p>

        <p>Yea that's the problem of confusing IFR vs CFR. If you tested everybody(which is an insane waste of resources, but that is the definition of government), then it would be IFR, and be like 0.05%, and not much worse than influenza.</p>
<p>That could be why they are making people get paranoid over cases. People don't know the difference, since the media doesn't highlight the fact that CFR dropped a <strong>ton</strong> because of excessive testing, actually illustrating that its not deadly at all.</p>
<p>Of course people don't care. They are not smarter than sheep that follow other sheep because one gets distracted by a plastic bag flying.</p>
<p>My father and my brother are both sheep. They don't care. It's all about how it feels. Data flies completely over their heads.</p>
<p>I literally think some people will only wake up to the reality if the elites get bold enough to tell people to go kill themselves to avoid covid infections. Considering the Canadian health* authorities are telling people to go use gloryholes and wear a mask while having sex, I'm kinda hopeful lol. Perhaps some of the ones at the top are that stupid.</p>
<p>*Telling people to go suck a random ass penis is NOT health advice. They got paranoid about AIDS in 1970, and they are suggesting that. Seriously. It <strong>never</strong> was about health advice.</p>

<p>NYS has "COVID IS STILL A RISK WEAR A MASK" on highway signs, on buses, etc. Just having those signs PROVES that it's not a risk. If it really was a risk there would be zero need to proclaim it, we would all know that it was a risk and would social distance and do all this shit organically to protect ourselves.</p>

        <p>I’m in a very liberal city in NorCal and people wear them everywhere even when walking outdoors by themselves. People even wear them when jogging by themselves. It’s hard to picture being in a place where people are not wearing masks outdoors or only wearing them in businesses that require them. The hysteria is real where I am.</p>

        <p>I was at the biggest outdoor mall in my city yesterday and I swear, 90% of people were wearing their masks just walking around the grounds. It was insane. I sat on a bench for maybe 30 minutes and an older lady sat on a bench maybe 15 feet from me and she work a mask the entire time. She was alone.</p>
<p>I’m outside right now walking my dog and someone just drove past me wearing a mask. He’s also alone and in his car. What is wrong with these people?</p>

I took my little boy out to an AppleBees with outside dining 3 weeks ago. 99% of the patrons had no masks on (we were dining outside spaced apart by staff). </p>
<p>There was one couple with a mask on and get this: a hole in the middle with which to sip from a straw inside their drink. </p>
<p>We didnt stay long enough (we were finished with our meal and headed out by the time I noticed them) to see what they planned to do once their meal arrives </p>

        <p>If this is in an area where masks are optional then I agree, however if it's in an area where masks are mandatory under threat of punishment then it is the mask that is being forced on to society so this would be resistance.</p>

        <p>Everyday I see something that boggles my mind regarding masks. It’s mandatory where I live but not just in the stores-everywhere where a 2m distance can’t be maintained. Everyone super compliant here. Today’s highlight was the guy running down the street wearing one &amp; then coming back 10mins later with his mask down &amp; smoking a cigarette, which has become illegal here since about 5wks. It’s crazy</p>

        <p>I’m here in Central N.Y. state and about 40-50% of my fellow runners and as many cyclists are indeed masked. Most pedestrians as well. I’m in my early 60s and have been running for decades and hiking around here since childhood. Never seen anything like this. And most of them are younger than me (!) Bizarre.</p>

        <p>I actually do wear a mask indoors because I think the science indicates that they are probably useful at limiting the spread and I don't mind doing it if it can actually help (whether or not you think it should be required of us is a different conversation than whether or not they help IMO), but I never wear one outside because again, the science has shown that outdoor spread is pretty rare so why bother?</p>
<p>Edit because for some reason I’m being downvoted: my parentheses was meant to clarify that mask usage should be a choice. But I don’t personally believe that masks are “all hype” I think we have pretty good evidence that they help slow the spread if an infected person is wearing one.</p>

        <p>I'm fine with people wearing mask if it's their own choice.  </p>
<p>I'm not fine with it if the idea is because they are potential carriers and they have to protect everyone else...even though they there is no reason to believe they are carriers.</p>
<p>Also...weren't masks supposed to be for <em>only</em> when you couldn't social distance?</p>
