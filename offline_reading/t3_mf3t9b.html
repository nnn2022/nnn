    <strong>Is there hope?</strong>
    <p><p>Let me start by saying that I'm not anti- vaxx, and I believe that there is a virus. WHY I believe this is not about the virus nor about government so deeply caring about our well-being.</p>
<p>1) The data is being manipulated. That's a fact, check gov websites, it says there that people don't have to be tested for COVID to be written off as if they died from it. Not to mention that if you have underlying health conditions and happen to contract COVID and die NOT from it but WITH it- automatically, you died from COVID. That very well explains the sheer number of deaths that everyone is so feared about.</p>
<p>2) Censorship. Have you tried to comment anything opposing from general public? It's going to be deleted right away and you most likely will be banned. Your freedom of speech? DOESN'T EXIST. Your opinion? People will judge you for questioning.</p>
<p>3)Vaccination is experimental. Now everyone saying that you're selfish for not taking vaccine, it goes both ways- you're selfish to insist for me taking one. I'm all pro vaccine, but NOT THIS ONE. It has never received FDA approval, skipped testing on animals, doesn't have long term effect data, doesn't even have an accurate efficacy of it's effectiveness- you saw numbers they change by the day how AstraZeneca is one day less effective next day more effective, one day might be life threatening other day "yeah guys, false alarm, it's ok". The idea of them pushing it, when the survival rate of this virus is greater than 99% is  illogical. Not to mention that praised Pfizer vaccine is very well known for bribery. Just Google it. Taking vaccine just so you could have your liberties back is STUPID. The only reason you should take it is for your health concerns and this vaccine didn't prove to be safe yet. Not to mention that pharmaceuticals refuse to be held accountable in the instance of side effects.</p>
<p>4)Every other health problems are being ignored. You know what's sad? People losing their lives when it was totally preventable. People didn't get diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular diseases, didn't receive help for their mental health, and hundreds of others. Like that doesn't even exist anymore. And to say, it was all preventable but we just ignored these people and prioritized COVID where the avg age of death is what, 82yo? Now I'm not saying that elderly don't deserve medical attention, all I'm saying it's UNFAIR to pick the side where majority is already lived their lives over ones who still had a chance to have theirs ahead.</p>
<p>5)Jobs and business lost. People are in debts, the unimaginable stress and anxiety people suffer from this is immeasurable, can argue if it's worse to cry yourself to sleep because you don't know how you'll get out of this or risk to get COVID and go on with your life where you have 99% you won't ever notice you ever had it. The effects on the economy will be there for years to come.</p>
<p>6) Restrictions to see your loved ones. What's life anymore if you can't go outside, can't see ones you love and enjoy things while you here? It's a living hell, I don't imagine elderly people actually wanting to live the rest years they have alone locked up to be protected. That's just not life. I know I wouldn't want that, I'd hate to live like that.</p>
<p>7)COVID passport. Now that one is fucked up and beyond. Imagine if you had to carry passport everywhere to prove that you had your flu jab to say. To enter the shop. To enter the restaurant. To enter a pub. To enter any venue. They scan a barcode and let you in. They didn't do this with any other disease, like you know, more life threatening ones like HIV/AIDS. What's this sudden need to know your whereabouts at all times? </p>
<p>8) Overcrowded hospitals. Now we all seen people saying "but how do you explain the number of people in the hospitals". So there's few reasons for that. a) people don't get medical attention from their GP's anymore, therefore they wait out until they are in critical condition and go to ER, where this could've been totally prevented if they haven't been refused to be seen by their family doctor where under new regulations it's nearly impossible. b) not enough employees, nor enough support from the government to be as efficient as they could be. Government is saving money on your account, they don't give shit if you die, never did. c) people catch COVID IN THE HOSPITAL more than anywhere else. I've read an article where boy got into come before pandemic and had COVID TWICE in 9 months period before finally waking up. Now HOW THE FUCK? What are health and safety regulations in there that this happened? TWICE?  </p>
<p>9) Stimulus checks. Now that's bribery right there. People LOVE getting money while not having to work. But let me tell you- nothing is free. You'll pay for this later. The jobs and businesses won't be able to recover and now majority will be dependent on the government. And that my friend is check mate. That "free" money will haunt you and your kids in future. You'll have to play by their rules as the feeding hand will be the government.</p>
<p>10) Lockdown doesn't work. It's been over a year and the numbers were just bad the whole time. They didn't care to focus on people who needed to be hospitalized but instead of EVERYONE that had positive test ALTHOUGH those tests are extremely inaccurate so the numbers are also false. The purpose of whole lockdown nature is to control people's movemen prevent people to gather and protest. It's dehumanizing to ask everyone to be isolated from another human being for this whole time like if it was fucking Ebola. We are very sociable species and this liberty taken away WITH NO CHOICE nor ability to be responsible for your own health as you were your whole life. If you're vulnerable- it's your choice to risk, and it's my choice to live knowing that I also risk 0.03% to die from COVID. it's selfish to insist us to stay home to protect the minority, us going about our lives will actually help to keep the economy alive and get herd immunity faster. Keeping everyone locked up in the cage only drags the misery and vaccine is not your golden cure until it's proven long term effectiveness.</p>
<p>Now the list can go on and on. I'm actually starting to drown in sorrow and don't see a light. People blindly obey and crucify you for questioning. How can they NOT question? 
Is there a way we WON'T reach a point of no return? 
Feel free to add anything, feel free to give me hope or prove me wrong. I really hope it's not the way I see it cause for now we are headed towards the doom.</p></p>

        <p>Word, 
it’s a globalist agenda to bring on mandatory vaccines to control future population growth with a unlucky lottery of vaccines meant for sterilizing children. so they can’t reproduce when they get older. 
My guess is, 1/3 of the children population might get this unlucky vax. And I think the roll out will be 2030. So not our kids. But our grandkids will have this fight to deal with if we don’t stop this vaccine passport.</p>

        <p>It could also be they're pushing the vaccine app so much because they want everybody familiar with the technology (and think people are more likely to accept it if they think it's for their safety). Then it would only be a small step to introduce an app to manage all of their finances - including a UBI direct from gov. This could be part of what they're calling the great reset. Every transaction could then be logged and fed into a social credit system. Would be any future dictator's wet dream.</p>

        <p>Ah I don't believe they're are waiting mate, rn the vaccines are definetly not a placebo nor a prevention from so called "deadly" virus. Pharmaceuticals making trillions of this, people get minimum to no protection from the vaccine the only reason for this that they are using it for something completely different. And if you have done bit back research,  humanity is already on the thin line of reaching point of no return in the sense of pollution, overpopulation, lack of food, water. Rich won't be letting world just die together with their children and wealth, no, they will save the world on our account and have control over us so that would not happen again. </p>
<p>Fucking hell, sound like extra conspiracy theorist but it's so obvious, have to be insanely stupid not to see that this is not about the virus nor that government loves you so dearly that they try to protect your life. WAKE UP, THEY NEVER CARED ABOUT YOU, YOU'RE JUST A NUMBER. and yet people wonder how in WWII jews got into those gas chambers. They didn't question, just complied with everything, EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE DOING RIGHT NOW.</p>

        <p>United States perspective.  One size does not fit all... never has.</p>
<p>1)- Absolutely!</p>
<p>2)- Nothing all that new really... "freedom of speech" is subject to interpretation.  Nowhere is any individual guaranteed an audience and protections are specifically from government censorship.  Private entities can censor all they want... and corporations have first amendment protections just like people... meaning that media, which possesses the equivalent of a megaphone, can say what it wants and has the means to ensure an audience.</p>
<p>3)- Agreed 100%.  I'd just as soon not be the equivalent of a laboratory rat.</p>
<p>4)- Covid has "sucked the oxygen out of the room".  The purpose is to magnify it in people's minds and maintain the sense of crisis.</p>
<p>5)- Economic disrepair and damaged mental health may well be intentional</p>
<p>6)- <strong>They seeded nursing home spread by ordering/incentivizing the facilities to take in infected people... this at a time when people were ordered to stay home and the economy shut down because the nature of the virus spread was known.</strong>  Think about that.</p>
<p>7)- Normalizing a culture of medical surveillance is likely an end game... an objective of the plandemic.</p>
<p>8)- I suspect in most cases, "overcrowded hospitals" is media-overblown to sow fear and panic.  Also- if people are getting sick multiple times over one year form the same virus, what exactly is the purpose of a "vaccine"?</p>
<p>9)- Not to mention a devalued currency whose spending power has been wrecked by oversupply.</p>
<p>10)- Lockdowns work to reinforce fear and normalize government micromanagement of life.</p>
<p>Is there hope?  Maybe- if more folks like you applied thought to the entire process and stopped taking in media propaganda without question, then there IS hope- because that will do farmore than masks and restrictions to get us out of this.</p>
<p>Oh, and critical thinking doesn't always mean you're correct, but it does allow for learning.</p>

        <p>Let me start by saying that I AM anti - vaxx, and I DONT believe that there is a virus. Germ theory is completely unproven bs. Vaccines have never stopped anything. All the pro vaxx people always bring out the polio vaccine as proof, but they couldn’t be more wrong about that. Polio was/is not caused by a virus. Vaccines have always been a sham.</p>
