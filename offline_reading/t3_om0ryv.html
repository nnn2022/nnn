    <strong>Stop harping on whether these vaccines are “approved by the FDA”</strong>
    <p><p>Fuck the FDA — it’s just another layer of authoritarian bureaucracy and their approval is already a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Repeat, the FDA will absolutely approve each and every covid vaccine that has already been rolled out in the USA.</p>
<p>Objecting to getting jabbed on the grounds of whether or not some federal bureaucracy has given the go-ahead is one hundred percent redundant — the FDA is going to approve, so if you’re waiting for their judgement call then you might as well give up with resisting and book your appointment, because there’s zero chance whatsoever that the FDA isn’t going to rubber stamp these vaccines sooner or later.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed.  And once they are officially approved, you can expect mandatory vaccine  programs  everywhere  -- and vaccine passport  will become a  part  of the new  normal for  good  </p>
<p>Unless, the doctor's  prediction about vaccinated  peeps dying en masse in a few years comes  true</p>

        <p>I personally don’t believe the vaccines are intended to cull the population, only because that’d be too extremely obvious and would easily derail the larger agenda of biosecurity surveillance state theater that’s already begun to shape the future of human society.</p>
<p>Better to let the herd surge in its own self-righteousness and zealotry, shunning even the most reasonable disagreement over a relatively harmless medical intervention to an overhyped illness which doesn’t seriously affect most people, in order to easily drum up support for authoritarian encroachment, all of it under the auspices of “protecting everybody,” or whatever it is these historically illiterate fuck freaks genuinely believe the state is doing for the good of the public, as opposed to, ya know, the whole centralization of authoritarian social control, which even <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/how-authoritarianism-has-spread-since-the-coronavirus-pandemic-began">PBS freely admits is actually happening on an international scale.</a></p>
<p>They want passports, they want checkpoints — they literally want you dead for disagreeing, and I’ve got a whole naughty list of saved comments wishing death on the unvaccinated, so there’s no convincing me that it isn’t a popular opinion.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's a matter of belief.  It's a matter of big pharma money, extreme rush, lots of government lobbying corruption, etc  </p>
<p>As you know, WHO was trying to remove natural immunity from the definition of 'herd immunity' and claim that herd immunity could only be achieved via vaccinations.  There is a lot of surreal stuff happening all at once - you don't need to believe it - just  look it up.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you mentioned, however I don’t believe the current vaccination campaigns are intended as the final solution to cull the population, so much as they’re intended to control them over time and herd the gullible public along to its own destruction.</p>
<p>And don’t get me wrong, I understand that there is a mutual interest among the super rich when it comes to culling the human population.</p>
<p>If anything, assuming mass vaccination were in fact the weapon of choice for the eugenics-obsessed superclass to cull the population, I’d imagine it would be considerably further down the line, once the infrastructure and institutional framework has been thoroughly laid beyond any room for debate whatsoever, and that’s going to take years, possibly even decades and generations of fear mongering and false flag terrorism to fly under the radar without masses of people like ourselves still being freely able to object to it.</p>
<p>Not saying it is or isn’t the case, just my opinion.</p>

        <p>They want obedience. They want to destroy the will of humans. Studies have been going into this since the 1930’s and a former national security advisor wrote a book that was discontinued in the 1980’s that spoke of genetic means to influence the public.</p>

        <p>Why do you think the only purpose  is to create a biosecurity surveillance state?  Perhaps decreasing the population is the bigger goal?  <br>
Or,  it could also be a gigantic mistake - driven by greed.  We need to consider all possibilities.</p>

        <p>Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely agree that depopulation is a top priority for the superclass — they muse about it openly like deciding what’s for lunch, and anybody who’s bothered to look long enough already understands this reality.</p>
<p>Control, and the centralization thereof, is the primary motivation for these cult leaders and their cult indoctrinates — control over speech, freedom of movement, economic activity, and every conceivable means of social interaction that can possibly be infiltrated and steered towards the consolidation of every available means of authority, for themselves and their minions, and that’s all it’s ever been about.</p>

        <p>Because I suspect  the efficacy and  safety of vaccines  is vastly overrated,  while for ivermectin it's underrated.   This would clearly show  that -  or  perhaps  not.   Either way,  we'd have some real answers.</p>

        <p>I believe there’s plenty of evidence to support the position that mass sterilization and population reduction are on the agenda for the authoritarian ruling class, however I don’t believe they’re tipping the hand too soon with this current round of mass vaccination.</p>
<p>IMO we are experiencing the bricklaying of institutional framework that could potentially enable exactly those agendas further down the road.</p>

        <p>Again, I think the effects of this round of vaccines will be <em>relatively</em> harmless.</p>
<p>That being said, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a greater spike with infertility, and if it happens then it’ll be spun as a “necessary sacrifice” by the same zealots currently refusing to acknowledge any deaths brought on by the vaccines right now.</p>

        <p>Of course you’re not stopping me, internet stranger — you’re nobody to me and your attempts to disparage are completely meaningless.</p>
<p>The longer you talk about me personally and say a bunch of cliché bullshit attempting insult, intentionally avoiding the substance of my words and derailing the conversation into mudslinging, the more you expose your own lack of cognitive capacity for rational conversation.</p>
<p>Please, keep going — I’m interested to see how far you’ll fly off the handle trying to avoid the subject 🙂</p>

You mention doctors who say crap abut culling the population yet about 95% of doctors are vaccinated so obviously the people with the most knowledge absolutely don't agree with your Facebook YouTube research.  </p>

<p>It's easy to claim outlandish things and call people who don't believe you sheep. It's harder to actually prove those claims. Your clearly not able to provide a reliable source.  </p>

        <p>But even then, they won’t allow it to be tied to the vaccines. They will blame the unvaccinated. And I think they are preparing to shut down the conversations from the people who know what is happening. Look at the scale of censorship and cancellation we’ve seen in the last year and a half. And next steps:  the US is going after your personal text messages for “misinformation” and we’ve got the Canadian government introducing bills that can allow them to censor the posts and content we make on social media platforms. And a massive percentage of the populations are asleep of in denial to it all. 
Things are just starting to get real.</p>

        <p>I looked at your profile. You have a year old account that just started posting a couple days ago. There is no way someone who is so obsessed with these ideas would only just start posting. Therefore, this account must have been bought/farmed for this purpose. My best guess is you’re part of the Russian troll farming group. Spreading misinformation to spread disease in places like America/Western Europe. No point arguing with you though, because you’re either being paid to spread misinformation, or are so deep into the conspiracy that you’ll never be able to see past it. I hope for your sake that it’s the former.</p>

        <p>Not at all — if anything, the fact that hundreds of millions have already involved themselves is reason enough that everything about these vaccines is one hundred percent sunshine and rainbows on every level of everything to do with it, and you’re not cool if you aren’t doing the thing that everybody else is insisting you ought to do, because collectivism. </p>

        <p>So lets get this straight. Coronavirus makes you tired for a few days. Some people die from blood clots. But 99% of people recover. Which is less deadly than the flu. But we have to shut down the whole planet and force experimental vaccines that cause permanent damage in 75% of the people that take it. Just to be safe from a weak virus? No.</p>

<p>Dr Hoffe explains he has been performing D-dimer tests on his mRNA‘vaccinated’ patients and he has worryingly identified that 62 percent of them had these microscopic blood clots.</p>
<p>-&rt; If the injection is a slow kill from blood clots, then like a slow poison, people will not realize it's dangerous due to others around them dying until it's too late.</p>

        <p>It doesn't just make you tired for a few days. Your immune system must be solid if that is your experience.</p>
<p>Calling it a flu is dumb since people die from that all the time you aren't helping your argument. The flu isn't as big of a deal because enough people get the vaccine every year that you do not hear about it as much. </p>
<p>As for the vaccines, they are meant to avoid death not 100% protect you. It is also meant to reduce the spread so you can go outside without having to worry all the time. I have no idea where you got the 75% number from because if that was the case most of my friends would be debilitated.</p>

        <p>Nah it's a good way to convince someone to not take it. Just tell them to wait until they have completed the phase 3 trials. It's a perfectly reasonable position to take even if you aren't as skeptical as we are. It worked on my 17 year old daughter to promise me she would wait until at least 2023 before she considered getting it. She's already seen that I was right as fuck because of the myocarditis, GBS, and deaths and won't ever take it so now my anxiety about this entire pandemic is over.  It's just going to be more and more obvious as time goes.</p>

        <p>This is a big point I've been trying to make. Too many people saying this and I'm like "So you're going to be willing to take it once it passes?". These people have the whole world under control, particularly the govt agencies. The FDA has passed plenty of poisonous drugs and vaccines. And the pressure was nowhere near it was compared to this situation.</p>

        <p>Yep.</p>
<p>The FDA, which approves 'food stuffs' that are nothing more than cardboard dust, gums, fillers and sugar and approved because it is 'non toxic'.</p>
<p>It's also a bad objection to use.. Are we really refusing the Vaccine because it is not FDA-Approved?<br>
A good salesperson would simply say "So if the FDA approved the Vaccine, then we're a go?"</p>

        <p>It's only mind games if being used to manipulate.</p>
<p>Perfectly fine to prepare for objections, as the idea is to get the customer to stop procrastinating and purchase the product.</p>
<p>Closing doors or 'objections' before they come up is the best.</p>
<p>But yeah, I've seen Sales &amp; Marketing courses, and they creep me out, as they really seem like it's training to manipulate people down 'sales funnels' and stuff.</p>
<p>Probably why I'm not a top salesperson :D I'd rather deal honestly and respectfully with people, but I get by :D</p>

        <p>Totally, like there’s definitely ethical boundaries which separate the good salespeople from the scumbag pieces of crap who will manipulate people into buying products they don’t need and would receive no value or benefit from, exactly as is the case with these mass vaccination campaigns, which all bear the resemblance of sales funnel bullshit that we’ve all seen in the youtube ads.</p>
<p>I don’t have any objective need for any of these vaccines, on top of simply not wanting them, so the fact that vaccine zealots everywhere between federal government and corporate media and the Reddit comment sections are trying so desperately to convince me to buy a product which I have already decided against is just plan old scumbag salesman tactics showing its ugly face.</p>
<p>Stay honest and respectful, that’s already tops IMO 👌🏼</p>

<p>Fda approval doesnt magically equal safe or effective. </p>
<p>There are numerous drugs that I would never consider taking even if I had 'x' condition. I would never take something [again] that doesnt have at least 5 years of post market research. </p>

        <p>True, however I would add that the scale of the current situation is monumentally larger and there’s so much more social pressure than ever before to establish these new vaccine technologies, so it seems more likely than not, that these vaccines will eventually be rubber stamped.</p>

        <p>I totally agree, and have been saying this for awhile. However, I understand the value in bringing up the fact to the doomers who <em>do</em> respect the FDA. When even <em>their</em> appeal to authority hasn’t approved it, how can they insist it’s safe? </p>
<p>Of course, that’ll only last so long until the FDA inevitably approves it. But it’s fun watching them squirm right now, lol.</p>

        <p>The best argument is just saying that if the vaccine is truly safe, the companies would make it so you could easily sue for liability if you get harmful side effects.</p>
<p>That fact that you waive your right to compensation if something goes wrong says all you need to know.  <br>
But even if you could sue and get rich for getting ruined by the gene therapy injection, I would still say no.  Not worth selling your soul to gain the world.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t doubt it — the social engineering class understands mass psychology to such an extent that they know exactly how to infiltrate social movements and steer them in whichever direction is necessary for the benefit of the agenda of the week.</p>
<p>IMO one of the craziest and most insaniest aspects of 2020 was the overnight shift from mass hypochondria and suddenly into massive gatherings, because racism — such obvious baiting coming from corporate and social media, sowing further widespread division during a declared crisis, distracting the average well-meaning person from noticing the unprecedented power grab taking place around them, channeling the collective energy and social anxiety of everybody affected by authoritarian overreach who might’ve otherwise resisted the authoritarians, into fighting amongst themselves over base-level identity politics.</p>
<p>There’s an encyclopedia of social control techniques, and social engineers are constantly innovating, especially along technological lines in this whole bio digital age we’re goose stepping into.</p>

        <p>I agree. However, it is at least a means for buying time. I mean, if today I can escape because my school says they require vaccination <em>contingent on FDA approval,</em> that's fine with me. Meanwhile this stupid virus will run its course and it will be nonsensical to get vaccinated against an extinct virus. At least that's my hope. </p>
<p>And meanwhile, legal challenges will be mounted so this doesn't happen again, but those can be a crap shoot if you get the wrong judge. Can we trust even SCOTUS to do the right thing anymore?</p>

        <p>Lol! Apparently you’re not wise to the agenda. The FDA isn’t likely to give Approval any time soon.. They are indeed captured by Big Pharma and that’s exactly why they won’t give full approval. With regular approval certain standards kick in. All the current vaccines would be pulled almost immediately if held to those standards.</p>

        <p>Sure, the Lyme disease vaxx was recalled after saftey problems that are dwarfed by the recent VAERS reports. </p>

        <p>So my takeaway is ... if the adverse reactions haven't shut it down by this point, they won't be enough after FDA approval. The MSM won't care.</p>

        <p>It’s complicated.. normally I would say yes but it’s becoming clear the FDA and perhaps other healthcare gatekeepers have been captured by the Corporations they are supposed to be regulating ( same thing happened with banks and Wall Street in 2008) Regulatory Capture happens when executives from industry go back and forth between private and government jobs. They’re way too cozy ( plus, like Fauci, often they have giant financial conflicts of interest)</p>

        <p>Evidently you’re basing your judgement upon misinformation. None of what you accuse us of is verifiably true. “Microchips” and “autism juice” has never been a serious or respected talking point, here...the right to medical freedom and revealing government/corporate corruption is all we’ve ever been about. Last I checked, those aren’t even conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Vaccines are a billion dollar industry. What nefarious profits do antivaxxers have to gain from advocating for medical freedom and government/corpo transparency, honesty, and responsibility? You’re on the wrong side of history, bubs. </p>
<p>I don’t care that an experimental injection is available to the public, I just care that it’s being manipulated, coerced, forced, and lied about, and that governments across the world are crossing tyrannical lines to do so.</p>

        <p>You aren't getting to the root of the problem. It’s not the FDA that's evil; it’s the ones that are WAY above them. The problem goes much further than even the President of the United States.</p>

        <p>Dude its a well known fact that the FDA is a toothless organization, they aren't evil just underfunded and a bureaucratic mess. "what are you going to do to stop this" we aren't going to follow any covid restrictions and live life like normal. Either you have a vaccine passport to enter stores and bars or you have to ignore us and trust in your vaccine and let the plague rats die.   </p>
<p>when they lock you back down, and they will, blame the government not the unvaccinated</p>
