    <strong>Probably gonna get the Fauci Ouchie</strong>
    <p><p>So, my grandfather, whom I lived with my senior year of high school and was/is a big impact on my life has taken a turn for the worst. He has been placed in a hospice care facility through the VA, a facility that only allows visitors that have been fully vaccinated. He has been given an estimated 6 months, which honestly, might be a stretch due to the severity and variety of health problems he has been battling with the last couple of years. Because of this, I am leaning towards abandoning most of my principles, along with all logic and reason, and getting the jab.</p>
<p>I see the writing on the wall, and while part of me wants to fight the overt implementation of global medical tyranny, the other part of me is tired of standing on principle in a world where it is scarce and wishes to take part in it no more. Hopefully, I will be fortunate enough to grow old with my fiance on a farm, traveling a world that denounces the neo-fascist attempts to enslave all of humanity to a life of subjugation and serfdom, but I'm okay if that isn't the case, as on some level I have felt like I've been on borrowed time since my first deployment to Iraq in 2006.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether I get the "vaccine" or not, I will continue to speak out against the curtailing of our civil liberties. As a request, I implore you all to hold out as long as you can; to stand on principle where my legs have become weak. Someone must be the control group in this dark experiment where multinational pharmaceutical corporations are making billions off the suffering of all humanity by way of coercion and threat of force. This is even more important now that we have learned these companies have intentionally destroyed the clinical trial control groups.</p>
<p>My second and last request from you all this day is that you are kind, not only to each other, but especially to those with differing views. At the end of the day, all but a few of us are just trying to do what we think is right. Seek dialogue, not debate, and choose love instead of hate. Try not to get sucked into the team mindset that makes it easier for elites to divide us and further consolidate power and wealth amongst themselves. I know it can be hard sometimes when it seems so many are against you, but darkness can only be defeated by light.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you all for your kind words and input. I was able to see my grandfather today. I took some things to him from the assisted care facility that he was previously at to his new residence. They didn't ask if I was vaccinated, only went down a checklist of questions regarding symptoms and took my temperature. Hopefully, this is how it remains and I am able to continue to see him without having to get the experimental "vaccine." I hate to think this, but I did have the thought that my mom maybe lied to me when she said they are only allowing vaccinated visitors in an attempt to try and pressure me into getting the shot. Either way, for now, all is well Again, thank you for your heartfelt responses. Be well.</p></p>

        <p>It's a hard choice to make, but it is YOUR choice...it should always be a CHOICE (not mandate). You have to make the best decision you can for yourself based on your information you have right now, and your circumstances. No judgement here ♥️ I hope you get some good visits in with your grandpa and we'll all be sending good vibes your way.</p>

        <p>The good news is that Fauci is now trying to roll out a magic pill for prevention...that literally has the same mechanism as Ivermectin. So you may have options if you can wait a bit.</p>

        <p>No problem. </p>
<p>I hate I’m in this position as well. I’m going to have a talk with my grandpa and see what he has to say before I make a final decision. I’m not sure what the hospice facility’s rules are on him going out either. If he’s able to get enough strength to get back in his scooter and get outside, then I will not get the jab and just see him then.</p>

        <p>I was going to suggest this. I had my dad move into my home when covid first hit and they shut out visitors from his facility. He too was on VA hospice. Depending on the level of care gramps needs though, it might not be possible for op. Even with hospice, it's a lot of work for someone to deal with end life issues. But, it's something to consider for sure!</p>

        <p>I’m going to talk with him and see what he has to say before I make a decision. I’m still on the fence. I really REALLY don’t want to get it. I’m literally the only person in my family that isn’t already vaccinated, and they all largely feel like I should just get it. None of them are demeaning or anything, but there has been a wee bit of guilt tripping and soft shaming. Luckily, my fiancé, who has gotten the “vaccine,” is super supportive of whatever I choose. She wants me to get it so we can travel and what not, which is a big factor for my as well.</p>

        <p>They’re both an issue for me, tbh. The passports much more than the “vaccine” itself, but the pressure and disinformation campaign to coerce the jab is disgusting. Of course that isn’t the jab itself, but there’s the obvious safety concerns with it as well.</p>

        <p>If I may ask, why is he in hospice if he's got &lt;6 months left? </p>
<p>Whilst your intentions to get vaxxed are noble, you need to be aware of the high probability that you'll suffer a short-term side-effect that might kill you/reduce your quality of life to such a level that you will not only be unable to see him, but the news of your demise/deterioration will accelerate his demise as well.</p>
<p>Secondly, you need to understand that everyone who got vaxxed will have medium-term health issues which is why the 'stick' is being used in overdrive around the world. You need to make a risk-reward analysis of your situation and see if a lifetime of ill health is worth &lt;6 months of seeing grandpa. Emotions-based decisions for family are ones that I will never judge and I support whatever decision you make as long as you are fully informed. </p>
<p>As a Christian, I urge you pray like you have never before so that you find a way out that doesn't leave you vaxx-injured.</p>

        <p>Thank you for you input. This isn’t an easy decision. I am still on the fence and will not be making a decision until I have a conversation with my grandfather.</p>
<p>I’m the only person in my family that hasn’t gotten the shot yet. I’m also the only one that reads/hears more than what the legacy media pushes.  There are a lot of factors I’m my decision making process, primarily travel, but my grandpa is a big one.</p>

        <p>Thank you, and same. I’m literally the only person in my family that hasn’t gotten the jab. I’m also the only one that doesn’t get all their information from legacy media sources. People in my family have accused me of only caring about being correct, when, especially in this case, I’m hope I’m completely incorrect - and not just because I’m now considering getting it.</p>

        <p>Everyday, I gain more resolve to resist this until they threaten to shoot me. At that point, I will take the bullet as it will be a much quicker way to die. If you watch the video I link and still take it, I will pray for you.</p>

        <p>I hear you. That’s been my train of thought as well through all of this, but lately I’ve been in a kind of fuck it mood. I just got off the phone with my mother who refused to believe there are any long term safety risks, and that everything wrong right now is because of the unvaccinated. I told her if I decide to do it, it will be with the understanding that I’m essentially committing suicide. She hung up on me after saying no one you know has died.</p>
