        <p>Indeed. I do get stuff done, but it's tiring because I need to end up working past my regular time to finish stuff. I wouldn't even be replying on Reddit if I was at the office right now. Then add family duty calls that simply doesn't happen when you are at the office. Family members ask you for favors all day when working from home :P. "I'm working" isn't a valid excuse for them.</p>

        <p>This is the 21st century. It can for sure be the norm for jobs that are able to be performed 100% remotely. I'm hoping businesses realize that it can be done and allow people the option at least.</p>

        <p>Originally there was a big push (specially from Big Tech companies) that people would be able to work from home forever. However, now companies are <strong>starting</strong> to notice that production is getting impacted, so they might give up on that pretty quickly. The thing that makes the office production better is the fact that there are usually better communication and less distractions. I wouldn't be replying to you on Reddit right now if I was at the office.</p>

        <p>Technically they can be done remotely.   But not practically.   I reason that wfh looks good on paper but practically and generally speaking most people don't see or understand all the nuances of the pros and cons.   </p>
<p>You might be an exception but most people are not in fact more productive.   It's the old out of site it of mind.   And I'm not done old fuddy fuddy.  I was an IT exec with a large org.  I did let some people wfh when I knew they could handle it.   Other people complained and I said too bad.</p>

        <p>All of the SW teams in my company want to be given the choice to work from home as well, despite the burden it puts on us guys that work with the hardware. Where I could simply walk over and say hey your SW is broke shits not working here’s why...now I have to try to get them on the phone, listen to them blame HW as is tradition, then show them my setup with a webcam, before finally convincing them they need to come in and poke around with their tools. 1 hour drive for them later I’m repeating what I would have just started right at their desk. </p>
<p>Other times they consistently ask people to reboot their Remote Desktop or debug their remote setups cus they aren’t there in person. Some of them are selfish bastards that don’t even realize that we are enabling them to work from home. Compound that with the ones that are truly scared of covid but are totally ok with you having to be there to support them and you got some real selfish shit going on.</p>

        <p>I love the flexibility of working from home, but I also hate the fact that now I'm pretty much living at the office. There's no separation of home and work for me anymore, it's all mixed and fucked. I don't know what's better though. I miss having quick discussions in person (they were so much more productive), but I would also miss this flexibility of working from home lifting weights and doing exercises while listening to company meetings. I guess there are pros and cons on both sides, so I'm okay with any of them. Currently, I'm pushing for return to work because I don't think most people are being as productive as in the office.</p>

        <p>Yeah i for sure get what you're saying. I just hate staring at the wall of a cubicle all day and doing what can be done from home, wasting gas, sitting in traffic etc. I enjoy being able to be around my family more and to do what I like when I get free time. Idk I guess I've always been really good at going from work mode to home mode so I don't really notice the no separation thing.</p>

        <p>I wish I could do that. Perhaps if I had an "office room" in my house, then it would be easier to separate home and work. But the fact that I still use the same computer for both leisure and work while not being able to travel in my days off is really hitting me.</p>

        <p>Big difference between what people might say they would do vs what they actually would do. Most people wouldn’t quite their jobs. They would go to the office, complain about it for a few weeks, and then forget about it.</p>
