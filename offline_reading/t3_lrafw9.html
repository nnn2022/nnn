    <strong>The dystopian hellscape we inch ever closer to with each passing moment.</strong>
    <p><p>Every day that passes we slide ever closer to the dystopian hellscape we see taking shape on the horizon.</p>
<p>We now live in a world where dissent is shamed, asking too many questions is frowned upon, obedience is virtuous, fear dictates the decision making process of most, freethinking is discouraged as well as incentivized against and the state is not to be questioned or doubted in any circumstance.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy think for yourself when you can have a bunch of <em>seemingly</em> intelligent, ultra-wealthy and powerful elites make all of your decisions for you and tell you exactly what to do, think and say! </p>
<p>After all, what do you know? You‚Äôre just a measly and foolish peasant, these are <em>experts</em>! </p>
<p>You should take all of their orders and advice as the word of god and treat anybody that goes against it like a heretic and blasphemer! They‚Äôre obviously all  just far-right, science denying, racist and bigoted conspiracy lunatics after all!</p>
<p>After all, <em>politicians never lie</em> and <em>scientists never get payed off</em> or <em>censored for opposing groupthink funded by special interest groups!</em></p>
<p>Don‚Äôt think too hard about anything they‚Äôre doing or seek out any information on your own, that‚Äôll just cause you to become <em>misinformed!</em> </p>
<p>You need to get all your information from the left-leaning mainstream media or government! That way you‚Äôll only ever hear what we want you to hea‚Ä¶ I mean, you‚Äôll only ever hear the truth! </p>
<p>After all, if the government or left-leaning media doesn‚Äôt say it, it‚Äôs <em>harmful misinformation!</em></p>
<p>And you have to remember, if your neighbour breaks any relatively harmless or unjust public health restrictions, be sure to treat them like you would an escaped criminal and report them to the police to have the full force of the law imposed on them for having one too many guests over for dinner!</p>
<p>After all, that extra guest being there is pretty much indirectly murdering all of our grandmothers! Not the fact that viruses spread regardless of measly and ineffective attempts to contain the spread by causally malevolent politicians and health officials!</p>
<p>Lastly but not least, even if you‚Äôre young, healthy and have over a 99% chance of surviving Covid-19, you should take an experimental vaccine that has never been used on human beings prior and has no long-term testing whatsoever! </p>
<p>Despite the simplest form of cost/benefit analysis showing this would be unreasonable to say the least, if you even question it or show skepticism towards it, we‚Äôre going to label you a science-denying anti-vaxxer!</p>
<p>Everybody knows, when it comes to vaccines, the only people who ask questions are heretics and dangerous conspiracy theorists! I let them inject me with <em>anything</em> as long as somebody I perceive as intelligent tells me to! I don‚Äôt even care what‚Äôs in it or how little testing it has been subjected to!</p>
<p>Just trust the science, don‚Äôt ask questions. #science</p>
<p>(That only applies to the science we want you to see however, if it contradicts our position you have to ignore it.)‚Äù</p>
<p>This is the level of insanity we are dealing with in our current situation. I realize I am being highly satirical, however every single trope I mentioned has tons of real world examples that hardly even differ from what I said.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs how absurd the situation has become. Even something as ridiculously satirical as what I just wrote is unbelievably close to the truth of what they are telling us. </p>
<p>Each day that passes, the line between reality and satire blurs more and more‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The amount of people unquestionably going along with this undoubtedly sinister agenda has seriously shifted my perception of our chances against this deeply malevolent group of individuals that seeks to control every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p>We need to get a grip and resist this upcoming change they are attempting to implement  with every ounce and fiber of our being, lest we allow this dystopian hellscape to materialize and become our reality.</p>
<p>Stand up to those who seek to mold our society in the shape of their utopian vision. As with all other utopian visions, it will end in the suffering of all involved, possibly spare those enforcing it upon us all.</p></p>
