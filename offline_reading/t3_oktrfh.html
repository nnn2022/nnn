        <p>I post in this sub, not yet banned but I do not support the idea that people should not be unvaccinated or not wear face-masks. The whole idea that anyone can be allowed to sit a few feet away from me at work while not wearing a facemask and not being vaccinated is just a hill I will die on and bring to the Supreme Court of the United States if needed. There is nothing in the Bible for religious grounds. There are laws that basically say that a company can fire you for any reason at all including not conforming to safety guidelines. The law is on the side of those like me who want to force people to be vaccinated or lose their jobs. Fuck em all. These stupid fucks online who won't get vaccinated are a health and human safety risk and lets just get them fired from our places of work. We can and should and will pull it off together my friend.</p>
