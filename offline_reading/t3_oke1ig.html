        <p>Of course it's staged. Everything is. Shit, the FBI has to create criminals. They have to ship in drugs. So they can arrest the people who take them and sell them. They have to fourm hate groups and convince people to do hate crimes. They brainwash people to be bombers and mass shooters. They make up reasons to go to war. They force people to take a free vaccine and they charge $600 for insulin. They complain about pollution at the same time discrediting or stealing tech that would stop it. Look at all the doctors actually doing real work during this pandemic who are being silenced. If you haven't woken up to the fact that these people literally don't care about you what so ever during this pandemic. Well nothing will. I actually envy those people. But maybe our despair is on pare with the people who believe in 10 years the climate is going to kill them. The year 2030 is starting to sound like we are all dead or they want us to be.</p>
