    <strong>Why do people who announce they got their "shot" always sound sad/scared or fake excited? Like they have a gun to their head?</strong>
    <p><p>Is it me, or do the users on city sub reddits who suddenly announce their vaccinations to the world act like they're being initiated into some kind of cult/gang where they can finally be accepted without fear of being intimidated?</p>
<p>I mean just look at this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/ogfegj/i_just_got_my_first_dose_of_moderna/">post</a> of this person announcing they got jabbed.</p>
<p>There's a lot of fear building up, and people are being subtly scared into vaccinating...it's in the atmosphere.</p></p>

        <p>where I work, the unvaccinated have to wear masks. We all wear them like chinstraps so whatever. But recently I saw two people who were no longer wearing them, and they told me they got the vax just so they wouldn't have to wear a mask. </p>
<p>So I said "I don't trust the government".  And they both responded "neither do I". </p>
<p>Then why the fuck did you get the experimental injection?</p>

        <p>I don't understand how people give up their principles so easily. It's not two option dichotomy. You can always, you know, up and leave.</p>
<p>People have money for all sorts of frivolous shit, but somehow moving out to a place that's less of a hypochondriac shithole is "too expensive".</p>
<p>Ill happily live in a camper for the rest of my life to protect my heath. Not even a question about that.</p>

        <p>So they don't have to suffer and they can rub it in everybody else's faces lol nah they probs just hated wearing it but like yeah. Way to really stick with your beliefs lol. Meh. I feel sad for the kids in school wearing it. It's segregation. "Healthy" vs "potentially compromised and sick" backwards society we live in.</p>

        <p>It's because they know it's a huge risk but decided to get it anyway to be in the "in" crowd". So when they answer, they hope you're in the "in" crowd as well so they don't have to defend their uninformed, life- altering decision</p>

        <p>Could not agree more. Has to account for at least 90%. I'm sure the other 10% have different reasons.</p>

        <p>It's the people who have given in to "what other people think" mostly, the ones who essentially have succumbed to peer pressure. They must feel crap, especially generation z ers that were constantly told not to take drugs and give in to what is "cool" they have let themselves down, and some of them realise this. The ones who did it for their own selfish consumerist reasons, holidays, gigs donuts etc can be ashamed of themselves for a different reason. </p>
<p>The ones who were genuinely terrified into it by the media are the ones I will be righteously angry for if it turns out to cause inflammatory based death. And probably the only ones I would put my running off to the woods a la Robin Hood off for to help my fellow sensible people expose all of this and build a proper world.</p>

        <p>That person definitely did it to stick it to their family (pun intended). He/she sounds like a teenager or really immature.</p>
