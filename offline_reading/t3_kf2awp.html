        <p>Don´t you see? The virus is afraid of round numbers. Eighty-three days? Not nearly round enough. 110 days? Close but no cigar, you´ll have a third wave.</p>
<p>One hundred days on the other hand intimidates the virus with its pure and undefiled roundness. We wanted to go with ten million seconds initially, for optimal roundness, but it turned out that caused logistical issues, so we went back to the drawing boards.</p>
<p>Obviously, the right-wing populists will argue that ninety days or eighty-seven days, or any other number, might mean the difference between someone dying of an opioid overdose or getting his shit back together, or bankruptcy and getting through for a small business.</p>
<p>The thing is, its not that we don´t have justifications, or lack in sophisticated contemplation of the impact of the measures we impose on people. Obviously we have already engaged in very complicated cost-benefit analysis when we announce measures like this. However, none of the other variables that we take into consideration manage to weigh up against the profound antiviral effect of round numbers.</p>
<p>I also know the conspiracy theorists will be calling this ¨Security theater¨ or suggesting these measures are mainly meant as rhetorical tricks and symbols to appease people who are terrified, or that these measures are invented by pompous ivory tower academics who are cognitively imprisoned in their own narrow discipline that makes them utterly blind to the harm they impose on everyone else.</p>
<p>Obviously those conspiracy theorists are wrong and the very notion of being considered a conspiracy theorist by other people carries such a massive social stigma that it should be sufficient to stop you from even daring to openly ponder dangerous questions like this in the foreseeable future.</p>
