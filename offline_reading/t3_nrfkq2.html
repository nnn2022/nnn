    <strong>Aside from telling doubters to fuck off, what steps would you take to explain why your wife is concerned about getting the vaccine while breastfeeding your newborn daughter?</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôm concerned my wife will get shit for this from doomers and her reasoning for not getting the vaccine is that she has seen some studies supporting SIDS as a probable outcome of taking untested drugs that have such a checkered past like the host of covid vaccinations being pushed to the public. Her thought process is that if this overhyped bs virus is the reason why she is mandated to be vaxxed up with something that only has emergency approval by the fda and it takes our daughter from us, she will come after the powers that be till she draws her last breath.</p></p>

        <p>Youre told to stop many medications when pregnant and breastfeeding. Without long term studies done, how can we be so sure that this isn't a medication they'd advice us to stop? </p>
<p>It would be irresponsible to assume it is safe. So tell her to just claim she is being a responsible parent.</p>

        <p>Most medications aren‚Äôt recommended during pregnancy/breastfeeding because often times <em>there are no/limited studies</em>, and so it‚Äôs better to lean towards the side of caution. Conducting such studies is usually considered <em>unethical</em>. Why none of that logic applies to these brand spankin‚Äô new vaccine technologies, I can only assume is linked to the money.</p>

<p>If they look puzzled just tell them that you were under the impression that the conversation had entered the insulting questions that are none of your business phase.

        <p>If people you spend time around a lot are giving you shit for the way you raise your kid, you may not want to keep spending time with them, online or off.  There is still a difference between "hey, this is important, I believe this may be the best for the health of your new child" and "you're a miserable mom!", at least in my mind, but covidian-zealots usually fall in to the latter category, not the former.</p>

        <p>I'd use this opportunity to cull those toxins from your life.  You want your baby to grow up around people toxic enough to buy into this shit?</p>
<p>Your wife is making the absolute right choice and if she is met with unreasonable resistance (I'm not just talking about someone asking why) I'm talking about people being unreasonable.  Well then you need to start asking yourself if you want your wife and your baby-to-be to be around a toxin like that.</p>
<p>She recognized the toxins in the vaccine and now she needs to go way back 100's of years to the original toxin to mothers which is stress.  Don't let these people stress her out and put that baby at risk. </p>
<p>I'd suggest that you calmly and politely take them aside like an alpha male protecting his wife and baby, and you warn them that if they keep stressing her out about this vaccine that you will cut them out and cut them off.</p>

        <p>Those people you‚Äôre mentioning are her insufferable in-laws. It‚Äôs not an enjoyable measure but I‚Äôve always held them accountable and vowed to do the same to my wife but it hasn‚Äôt needed to happen very often at all. My old boss said fuck you to the doubters and doomers who invaded his personal life, he retired - retreated from the concrete jungle to his own property in the middle of nowhere and oddly enough trusts only science, real science. Not propaganda. Anyone who questions him to the point of ostracism - he cuts ties with.</p>

        <p>So they are your parents?</p>
<p>If so my suggestion remains the same.  Take them aside alpha male style and make it perfectly clear that their pressuring her to get the vaccine is totally unacceptable, that they are now putting their grandchild at risk with this stress and that there will 100% be consequences if it continues.  </p>
<p>You are about to be a dad and now is the time to  get in the mindset that you are here to protect your wife and your baby at all costs.</p>
