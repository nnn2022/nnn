    <strong>Isn't it amazing how China has all but been forgotten?</strong>
    <p><p>Last year around this time people were ravenously searching online to find more leaked videos about the situation in China. Perhaps a bit before now, too. We couldn't believe it - people dying in the streets, collapsing at their places of work, locked in apartments for weeks on end with the doors WELDED SHUT!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now it's all but forgotten. No one cares, they're never mentioned. You'd think that the lack of people dying in the middle of the streets here would set off some red flags.... Maybe it was... BULLSHIT? Maybe it was entirely overplayed, maybe China has a capability of lying for reasons beneficial to them?</p>
<p>No, you can't say any of this. It all comes back to - If only we took Lockdown measures like China, this would be over.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lastly - I honestly feel like that could be the one thing that blows this entire hoax to pieces. Don't argue the numbers, the lockdowns efficiency, don't do any of that. Why doesnt American or any other country have people keeling over in public and dying? WHY? Oh "Bruh it a new strain".</p></p>
