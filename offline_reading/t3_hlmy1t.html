        <p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; “The next peak is going to come. The next wave is going to come,” said Stephanie Silvera, an epidemiologist at Montclair State University. “How can we keep that as flat as possible?”</p>
<p>&rt; Gov. Phil Murphy has been clear on the answer to that question: people should keep wearing masks and social-distancing, while the state continues boosting testing and contact-tracing.
“We have done, and you all, have done extraordinary work to push both of these numbers down to where we are now able to get our restart and recovery moving,” Murphy said Thursday during his coronavirus briefing. “But, we cannot let up, even for one day, with our social distancing. We need you to wear these face coverings.”</p>
<p>&rt; The efforts of New Jerseyans have forced down many of the key coronavirus metrics that have allowed the state to roll back restrictions on gatherings and businesses. The rate of transmission has fallen from a point in March where every sick person, on average, was infecting five people, a recipe for rapid spread of the virus. The transmission rate was .82 as of Wednesday, a level that means the virus is no longer growing in New Jersey.</p>
<p>&rt; As long as that number stays below one, which means that every sick person is infecting one other person, the state can continue opening its economy, said George Helmy, one of Murphy’s top advisors.</p>
<p>&rt; Murphy has already showed he is willing slow the state’s reopening if he doesn’t like what he’s seeing. Indoor dining was set to resume on Thursday, but the governor delayed it because of large crowds, with many people not wearing masks or keeping their distance, at outdoor bars and restaurants last weekend.</p>
<p>&rt; “Given the current situation in numerous other states we do not believe it is prudent at this time to push forward with what is, in effect, a sedentary indoor activity – especially when we know that this virus moves differently indoors than out, making it even more deadly,” Murphy said Monday at his press briefing.</p>
<p>&rt; But if the virus starts growing again, meaning a transmission rate equal to or more than one, the reopening will stop, Helmy said.
Transmission rate and hospitalizations are the metrics Murphy and his team are keeping an eye on as they’re slowly reopening the state and watching the virus spread elsewhere in the country. Even with several states — and the country as a whole — <strong>currently recording record numbers of coronavirus cases, the state’s models project the earliest a second wave would come would be late fall or early winter.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; <strong>“Our modeling indicates a wave in the fall-winter,” Helmy said. “And some other modeling shows spring next year. It’s a massive time difference.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt; <strong>For now, the governor’s office won’t disclose the benchmarks they’ve set for starting to reimpose restrictions on businesses and gatherings, only saying a transmission rate above one would likely force some action to be taken.</strong></p>
<p>Based on the text in bold, I am going to predict that New Jersey will likely lockdown again <strong>both</strong> in the fall, and then again in spring of 2021 (this indicates to me that they are planning to drag this out into next year as well).</p>

        <p>That’s not a valid prediction. Just because the majority of redditors are cool with being locked down doesn’t mean most real people are. There will be no second full lockdown and the government would be stupid to try</p>

        <p>I swear to god, I swear to fucking god, if they try a second lockdown I'm going to organize fake BLM protests that are really just normal social activities.  Like, let's all have a barbecue for BLM!</p>

        <p>You really think it's only Redditors... If this didn't seep out from the internet, there wouldn't be as much adherence to masks, social distancing, and restrictions, including the lockdowns. There's some rebellion, sure, but the majority are complying with the requests of these tyrants. If not, there would be more riots and protests, and civil disobedience on the scale of the BLM movement. Right now, we are in the <strong>vast</strong> minority. People in these subs need to accept that.</p>
<p>Edit: Now that I think about it, I remember so many people at LDS shitting on me because I predicted more mask mandates, and lockdowns. AZ and TX, and even FL and other places, have initiated closings, and mask mandates. It's naive to believe another mass lockdown could never happen again, or that masks will "magically disappear". Hell, I laugh because LDS honestly thought people would "toss the masks away" due to the summer heat, even though that is not happening. In fact, <em>more</em> people are wearing masks now than ever.</p>

        <p>I don't see less social distancing, people still stand six feet apart in queues in places like PA, NJ, DE which I've been to those three recently. Yesterday, I went to Bucks County in PA, and this fireworks store had a long queue of masked up people standing six feet apart that wrapped around the restaurant I ate at. </p>
<p>The one thing I do see people ignore, even from the beginning, is arrows on the floor at stores. Though most people simply jump out of the way when someone approaches in either direction.</p>

        <p>The stimulus is a big deciding factor. There can be a significant shift away from lockdowns if it doesnt get extended. However, since it would mean a lot of initial economic shock, Trump may agree with dems to extend it.</p>
