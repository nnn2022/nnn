        <p>Totally agree. Of course maskers would say you can't force people to exercise. But for some reason you can force someone to wear a mask. Like why one but not the other?</p>

<p>Can we just all agree, to stop pointing guns at each other?</p>
<p>I believe in spontaneous order, civilization may appear chaotic but when you start trying to dictate to each other you just upset the hidden order underneath the veil of chaos. You wouldn't try to engineer a rainforest, humanity is no different we're as much a part of nature as anything else.</p>

        <p>I'm definitely not saying I agree with making gym time mandatory,  just pointing out that having a healthier society as a whole would do more to protect us. I wonder why the corporate backed new order we are living under doesn't realize it that. I mean, why would Netflix and Burger King not want us thinking like that?</p>

        <p>I don't know if this is true or not, but if it is it's still irrelevant as an anti-mask argument (if you're trying to argue against masks) </p>
<p>Viruses live in the moisture that is emitted from your face holes. When you wear a mask properly over your face holes, it reduces the amount of said moisture which enters the environment around you, and therefore reduces the amount of virus that enters the environment around you. Multiply that effect by the number of people who properly wear masks across the globe, and the outcome is a statistically significant reduction in the amount of covid-19 floating around in the various public environments across the world, and therefore, a reduction in infections, a reduction in strain on healthcare systems across the globe, and a reduction in deaths.</p>

        <p>&rt;The people dying of covid largely would have died anyway. The average age of a covid death is actually higher than the average life expectancy. Even grandma has a survival probability somewhere around 94 percent. </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm</p>
<p>Looks like from February to December of this year, 9 to 10% of deaths have been related to covid, and further, for the age group 25-34, about 6% of deaths are COVID related, and age group 45-54 onward, at least 8.5% of deaths are related to COVID. So for the ages 45 onward, we're approaching 10% of deaths being COVID related, no? I don't think I'm misenterpreting this data, what do you think? </p>
<p>But further, you're very focused on the micro ramifications (healthy younger people statistically not being terribly at risk), but what about the macro ramifications, including the intense strain on the health care system and how that strain on the healthcare system has had compounding negative effects on the population in relation to other aspects of disease and health? And have you ever had a sincere conversation with a nurse who has worked or is working in an intensive care unit experiencing this right now?</p>
<p>&rt; The loss of individual freedoms is far more dangerous than this virus is. This virus has unleashed a wave of totalitarian ideas in the name of safety that threatens millenia of progress towards the enlightenment ideals that the western world in particular was built upon. Giving those freedoms up was a terrible mistake, and it's not certain at this point if they will ever return.  Giving them up for a virus this weak is unforgivable.  </p>
<p>You're using a lot of words while not giving any examples of these losses of freedom. That's what I was asking for in my last message, I'm asking you to explain to me how we are losing freedom. I do not mean to sound crass or disrespectful, but please stop being cryptic and just supply concrete examples of these losses of freedom which you are alluding to. A bulleted list would be appreciated. I want to have a discussion, but it's hard to have a discussion when you're not giving me the information.</p>
<p>&rt;If its masks in particular you're asking about, then its debatable as to their effectiveness. </p>
<p>It seems that for the most part, scientists and doctors are on the same page about it these days, no? I'm honestly asking. Assuming that people collectively wear them <em>properly</em>, how could they not be at the very least effective enough to merit people wearing them until there's a vaccine? It's a very simple concept, the mask traps a portion of the moisture being emitted from your mouth and nose, and if you have covid-19, that means there is a reduction of the virus entering the public environment around you. Now multiply that reduction by the amount of people in the world who choose to wear the mask properly.</p>
<p>&rt;Mostly they serve as a placebo for people that love the smug satisfaction they provide. If you are a healthy person, you have virtually nothing to worry about here, and masks are useless to you. In a world consumed with virtue signaling,  they provide an effortless means to do so, and shame anyone that isn't afraid with the whole "its about others" concept. </p>
<p>You're literally just deciding that you know how the average person feels about their own personal use of masks. Considering that you're not an omnipotent psychologist who has interviewed every person in the world, compiled the data, and determined that most people wear masks to attain some type of smug satisfaction rather than wearing masks simply because it feels like the most logical thing to do in order to decrease transmission of a vaccineless disease which is dangerous to society and strains the healthcare system. I know that sounded crass, but I mean, come on.</p>
<p>&rt;The irony being that none of this is about others. Hundreds of millions have been pushed into extreme poverty by these ridiculous measures. Domestic violence, substance abuse, suicides, violent crime,, and more have skyrocketed. None of those things are considered at all.  Hopefully this helps</p>
<p>I'm not denying that these things are true, but if you don't mind I would like some sources that show, at the very least, correlation between covid-19 and its associated global efforts such as lockdowns and business closures to contain it, and the rises in occurrences like domestic violence, substance abuse, etc which you have alluded to.</p>
<p>Further, it's extremely important to consider what the state of the world could be like right now had we never implemented any form of lockdown, business closure, or mass wearing of masks at all. In the United States right now the CDC has the death count since February at about 250,000. What do you think it would be had we never taken any of these precautions? If masks were never mandated and businesses never closed, imagine the collective additional amount of covid-19 that would be in public environments every day. It's a compounding negative effect. Not only would there be <strong>so many more instances</strong> of people coming in contact with strangers, but there wouldn't even be masks to offer protection. It's undeniable that so many more people would be infected, and the death toll would be so much more.</p>
<p>But if we put wondering how terrible the world would be had we never started  wearing masks or implemented lockdowns aside, your concern about rises in suicides, substance abuse, etc, if it is caused by covid-19, is worth discussing. If there's a better way to deal with covid than what we have done and which would have produced a lesser negative effect in those areas which you've alluded to, then that's obviously worth discussion. Please share your thoughts on how it could have been done better while also producing a lesser death rate and a lesser strain on the healthcare system in general.</p>
<p>But with everything else you've said, it seems that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>have some type of inherent opposition to masks based on supposed loss of freedom, but you don't seem to list specific examples of loss of freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in order to support your opposition to masks, your arguments are based strictly on the micro ramifications to the average young, healthy individual while completely ignoring the macro ramifications on society, dismissing the 9 to 10% death rate (again, unless I misinterpreting the graph in the link I supplied above), and dismissing that healthcare systems across the globe have seen tremendous strain, and that strain produces negative consequences for the population in other ways not related to covid-19. Where I live, ICU beds are filling up or have completely filled up depending on the hospital. Elective surgeries are being canceledbecause they need to make sure they have the beds available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you seem to be under the impression that you know how the average person feels about their own use of a mask, to the point where you have convinced yourself that on average, it's about some form of smug superiority, or something like that. That's kind of odd, if you think about it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think maybe it would be a good idea if you seeked out some healthcare professionals such as nurses who are dealing with this and have an honest conversation. Try to see from their perspective. And also, maybe not everything is a conspiracy?</p>

        <p>Ok I'm pretty sure you are just trolling.  You really can't think of a single loss of freedom that has happened since January? Not even one? Is your life currently and the January version of it the same? If not, then you've found it. If so, then that's sad for you. </p>
<p>If virtue signaling is your goal literally every other place on this site is catering to you at the moment. Not sure what else the point of this can be. No matter how many words you type, this still isn't a dangerous virus. The people pushing these restrictions aren't frightened of it at all, as evidenced by their behavior. </p>
<p>You're an emotional guy, I get it. This hysteria has got to end, however. I think you may just be in the wrong place.</p>

        <p>Friend, I'm trying to have a discussion. We obviously have different opinions, but I'm trying to learn about your ideas. It would really help if you explain to me what you mean by loss of freedom, as maybe we don't have the same ideas on what freedom is. Will you please tell me the ways that we are losing freedom? I mean it, I'm asking you one person to another.</p>
<p>Further, I'm not trying to argue or be disrespectful, I put a lot of thought into what I wrote in response to you. You have some pretty definitive things to say and you seem very confident, it's only fair that when somebody challenges you, you put forth an effort to have a discussion. If you don't, it makes me question whether or not you even believe the things you say. And again, I'm not trying to come off as disrespectful. I invite you to have an honest discussion.</p>

<p>...now I’m stuck in a 1 bdm apartment in an area that is cold and rainy 90% of the time.  My health has gone to shit :(</p>

        <p>Back in March/April, I remember a lot of experts pushing vitamin C, D, zinc, etc., so everyone stockpiled here like with toilet paper. :/ No, "Hey, eat more fruits and vegetables, and go outside and play." Exactly as you said: "Stay inside."</p>

        <p>I've been saying this so many times, but everything going on is not about health... they could give a fuck about anyone's health to be honest.... if they did, they would let people know how to boost their immune system by eating healthy, getting exercise, fresh air, vitamin D (through sunlight and fresh air) and vitamin C</p>

        <p>I firmly believe vitamin C deficiency is quite common and often goes undiagnosed. All our fortified food? The vitamins are probably deteriorated by the time it gets from factory to facehole. And everyone already knows about vitamin D deficiency in the not-so-sunny regions of the world. Right?</p>

        <p>I do agree with you but also to add that with all the not organic (GMO) foods and the way some folks prepare foods, most of the nutrition is gone because it's not eaten raw and supplements are needed to meet the recommended nutrition daily amounts. Places like Canada and other parts of the US not getting enough sunlight, Vitamin D should be mandatory honestly, but one can never have enough!</p>

        <p>Yep. And all varying opinions on what is healthy and safe too. People need to be able to choose for themselves though. None of this, "Wear a mask for <em>your</em> safety. Oh wait, <em>my</em> safety. Just do it, because I like controlling people and am scared of everything."</p>
