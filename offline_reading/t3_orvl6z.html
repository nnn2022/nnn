    <strong>Just a quick thought</strong>
    <p><p>Don't you all find it funny that the people who are somewhat ignorant say 'one covid death is already a death too much'.</p>
<p>And then when someone has vaccine damage it's:
'oH bUT tHaTS OnLY oNE PeRSoN oR A fEW oThErs'.</p>
<p>They are mostly not concerned about any damage or deaths, just for their own panicking asses. With all the respect</p></p>

        <p>Yeah hypocrisy on a massive scale.</p>
<p>It's the same when we all have to sacrifice everything to save old and frail, it's worth it if it's even one life.</p>
<p>But the unvaxed can now die from starvation being unable to buy food and should go to camps, that's ok.</p>
<p>Vaccine deaths are just acceptable collateral even if young and healthy people die or get damaged. But save grandma from covid.</p>

        <p>It was never about saving lives, its all fear mongering .
Heres a few stats from worldometer of deaths this year:</p>
<p>278,782 sesonal flu</p>
<p>24,110,660 abortions</p>
<p>950,598 hiv/aids</p>
<p>4.644,202 cancer</p>
<p>222,990 malaria</p>
<p>2,826,835  smoking</p>
<p>1,414,312  alcohol</p>
<p>606,389  suicide</p>
<p>476,206  water related disease</p>
<p>14,418 death from hunger (TODAY)</p>
<p>But nobody gives a shit about these numbers since they arent forced on everybody daily </p>
<p>Meanwhile "covid" had 4.1m deaths in two years which was 2% of all infected and its not even certain how accurate this is since some countries had been suspected of intentionaly inflating numbers </p>
<p>This big bad pandemic going around and yet the global  population grew  by nearly 46mil this year</p>

        <p>What do you expect, they’re leftists hypocrites. Their world view is dictated by their feelings and their unearned and hubristic sense of moral and intelectual superiority. </p>
<p>There is a gigantic overlap, close to complete tbh, between the people who do it give a fuck if you have severe and permanent side effects from a vaccine because “one death is too many.” </p>
<p>And the people who rabidly cheer for the murder of the unborn. </p>
<p>And the same people will then turn around and tell Americans that we should have our guns forcefully seized because “one death is too many.” </p>
<p>These bastards will say whatever they need to say to make their appeal to emotion even if it contradicts all their other stances. They just want power.</p>
