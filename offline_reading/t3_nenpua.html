        <p>Why are people who have had covid getting these shots? You have to be completely braindead. Like I understand if you have never had covid and are super scared because of the media and you weigh your options but damn. You already had it! What the fuck are these people thinking?</p>

        <p>I had the thought, okay I know 10 people who got diagnosed with Covid, [one is the recent fully vaccinated person] Two got sick enough for the hospital, one almost did die but vaped like crazy which made his case complicated and wondered if he vaped something that was not good. The other 8 all lived and shook it off like a cold or flu even a friend with COPD. Maybe they were false PCR cases but I figured what were the odds, 2 out of 8, and then looking at the Covid shots, the risks of illnesses seemed so much worse and permanent damage too.</p>
<p>I wonder too what the hell is wrong with people who already had Covid getting it, you already have T cell memory and immunity. [I always felt they lied about people not developing immunity that made no sense to me especially with the mumblings about herd immunity]</p>

        <p>About 95% of (educated, PhD-getting) people I talk to have no idea what the fuck T-cell immunity is and they look at me like I'm spewing nonsense.</p>

        <p>Yeah; my whole family had it last year this time. My dad got his second shot last month and he was very ill. Cold, shaking, couldnâ€™t eat, sleep and had bowel issues. He was equally ill from the vaccine as he was from actual covid. The actual covid just took an extra week to recover from.</p>
