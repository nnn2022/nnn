<title>Your desire and need for a vaccine passport exposes your lack of confidence in the "safe and effective vaccine" you endlessly shill about and tout as the holy elixir. You're all fucking pathetic if you don't stop complying and stand up to this blatant tyranny.</title>

    <strong>Your desire and need for a vaccine passport exposes your lack of confidence in the "safe and effective vaccine" you endlessly shill about and tout as the holy elixir. You're all fucking pathetic if you don't stop complying and stand up to this blatant tyranny.</strong>
    <p><p>If you were really confident in your fucking JAB you'd be back to normal and wouldn't give a fuck about the unvaccinated. Instead you're practically begging for more restrictions and fondling the balls of your technocratic overlords, all of whom will eventually fucking turn on you once you're deemed non-essential and you're stuck filling up a fucking hospital bed due to your forty fifth booster shot and Big Mac combo leaving you a bloated, immunocomprised, wheezing mess. All for what? A cold virus with a 99.9% survival rate.</p>
<p>I still don't know one single fucker that's died from (read: WITH) this virus or know anyone who knows anyone that's fucking died. And believe me I know some specimens that by all accounts should be fucking dead by now. One's a cancerous, skeletal bed-sore of a human being who's probably fucking riddled with STDs and the other's a fucking whale who will probably have to be lifted out of his house by fucking crane when he does finally croak. Shockingly, both have managed to fucking live through "the deadliest pandemic in history".</p>
<p>The clot-shot does nothing but provide you with a smug, unearned sense of superiority and possible adverse side effects, up to and including DEATH. You can still get and spread Covid, so you're no better than anyone who hasn't had the fucking thing. A vaccine passport is fucking POINTLESS and discriminatory. Let's fucking face it, you want to punish us because our defiance casts a spotlight on your cowardice and you're fucking terrified we're right (and you'd be right to feel that way, because I'm fucking terrified we're right too).</p>
<p>Time to admit you were wrong. We'd actually all respect you for having the fucking balls and humility to throw your hands up and eat humble pie publicly. What's more, we'd fucking welcome you with open arms to the sub. The abrasiveness of my post might belie this following proclomation but: we're not the assholes you believe us to be. This isn't an echo chamber; we actually fucking look into the things that are posted and call it out if it's false or dubious. We're fucking skeptics, after all. We don't ban people just for being members of other subreddits, that's not our fucking bag, man.</p></p>

        <p>Some will never admit they are wrong. These parasites hide under the disguise of being nice and altruistic but when the sentiment shifts, they do as well and they are exposed for the selfish creatures they are.</p>

        <p>The vax passport is the globalistsâ€™ wet dream of finally filing <em>every</em> human being in a <em>single, centralized</em> database (and storing all sorts of personal info with it).</p>

        <p>Every person who took the vaccine that I know, only took it because they wanted to travel again. This a fucking joke and no one cares. </p>
<p>The people who are still afraid; life is a struggle, quit being a fucking pussy and grow up. Fuck I swear I feel like I am taking crazy pills</p>
