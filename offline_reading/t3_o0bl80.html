        <p>How has it been recognized that people from the LGBTQ+ community experience health inequalities and therefore may be at greater risk from Covid-19 than the general population?</p>
<p>Is "health" an entity that discriminates people based on their sexual preference?</p>
<p>I'd really like to hear whoever wrote that elaborate on that statement because to me it is not comprehensible and I see no explanation as for why this would be the case.</p>

        <p>Just another programming tactic... state ridiculous things, over and over, with a matter-of-fact and authoritative tone... till people start repeating it. If you get around half of people to say, for example, that the moon is made of green cheese, then it becomes what they believe to be reality... then you have normalized the cognitive dissonance. With no sense of probity or moral compass, people are far more susceptible to further psychological maniupulation</p>

        <p>LGBTQ+ probably more likely to have comorbidities specifically with STDs and mental health which can theoretically put them at greater risk of severe COVID-19, especially if they get stuck with homophobic or transphobic medical staff. It’s a big stretch and I doubt the person who wrote that even thought that far.</p>

        <p>They mean hooking up with random people on grinder. Also leads to dramatically higher rates of HIV and other diseases. </p>
<p>In all fairness, gay men are more likely to have weak immune systems for this reason, so coughing on them with covid or the flu is a bit rude. It could also be argued that it's not my problem. I will do my best not to cough on you, but I'm not taking experimental drugs for you.</p>

        <p>I’m looking, but it’s hard to know where to look that won’t want a vaccine. Care is out the window now. I have a back ground in trades, so could do some manual labour for a bit. But I find it sole destroying after while. I like looking after my guys, I like showing up to work. Shit pay, shit support. Great personal reward just from showing up and giving a shit. Now I can’t do that.  Somewhat frustrating. But the show goes on…</p>

        <p>you’re a good dude risking everything for what is right, no one should be forced into vaccination to keep their job. Who knows maybe they wont be able to make you. they are having hard times reaching their 70% goal and i hope more people wake up now is the time.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I’ve been kinda expecting it for a while. Most staff members have succumbed to the jab. I’m single, no family. I can leave and be okay. Stressed. But okay. There’s a few staff members that’s really don’t want it, but can’t afford to leave. Supporting families etc.</p>

        <p>This was my first ‘real’ job with a bureaucracy to navigate. I just wanna show up and care for people. I’m 30, lean, fit, healthy, I don’t need big pharma’s intervention on my healthy immune system. </p>
<p>I’m an ex sportsman. I have struggled with my mental health after a lot of head trauma. Post concussion syndrome. Got addicted to pain meds. Pills I got given as a 22 year old from a team doctor after breaking a rib. Codeine, tramadol, diazepam and zopiclone. They fucking ruined my life those little pills. Fuck big pharma. </p>
<p>I got a lot of head trauma around a period of heavy abuse of prescription pills and alcohol. Standard contact sport story. I was an international blindside flanker if that means anything to anyone. I hit stuff a lot. </p>
<p>Now im a 30 y/o with a brain injury. I don’t take meds. I have a holistic approach. Including changing my lifestyle to one were I serve others that need it. I look after 8 severely autistic adults. I’ve worked 30-40hrs a week this whole pandemic. I’ve bonded with them, I care for them. I’ve had security of a job. </p>
<p>Now it’s back into the abyss. </p>
<p>Into the turmoil. </p>
<p>My ego hates it. But I guess it’s not all bad. </p>
<p>I guess ranting on Reddit is me processing what’s going on.</p>
<p>Maybe I want some validation that this is a really annoying situation for me to be in. Big pharma fucking me again. </p>
<p>I liked this job.</p>

        <p>I feel the same as you, I am in my first real job (which I have had for a couple years now), where I get to actually serve the public and do something which is useful (even if it only kind of exists because of inefficient bureaucracy). I have worked full time, and had to deal with bullshit policies and office politics throughout the pandemic... What I have learned through this all is that most people are stupid, ask zero questions, and don't give a fuck about people unless they share their opinions. I am just waiting for the day the mandates come for my job too and building leverage until then.</p>
<p>My advice for you is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a medical exemption if you can. You may be able to get a doctor to say that due to your medical history you could be at a higher risk of clotting issues or vascular/heart problems arising from the vaccine. Medical exemptions from my understanding are probably the only way to keep your job in the care industry without being injected, but even then they may try to pressure you.</li>
<li>Don't quit. Let them fire you. At least then you can collect unemployment and severance and possibly talk to a lawyer about options.</li>
<li>Build leverage. This may not be possible due to your profession, but basically do the best you can to establish yourself as indispensable, and also, have a backup plan (this can include whistleblowing, activism, or even just another job).</li>
</ul>

        <p>I’ve thought about whistleblowing on the whole system I’m part of to be honest. I love my guys, but they are victims of a corrupt and pretty terrible situation.</p>
<p>I have refused to partake in meds training at work,  one of the only staff members to do so. I was expected to be trained to give pills to my residents twice a day. Quite a few of my residents have tergretol and Respiridrone twice a day. They have done for decades. I looked into those pills out of curiosity and was shocked at the side affects. Suicidal thoughts being one. I’ve spoken to junkies who have used them, they said it made them hallucinate! I see my guys hallucinating on it! The ex heroin addict that was showing me how to do meds at work told me these meds are like class A pharmaceuticals. I wanted no part in it. </p>
<p>One guy had olive oil prescribed for an ear infection 4 years ago. He gets olive oil put in his ear everyday. No one questions it. He gets ear pain a lot. It’s madness. The same guy got prescribed an ointment for the dry skin on his neck. Again, part of his twice daily routine. Contains paraffin, it’s been put on his neck for years. His skin is like elephant skin now.  </p>
<p>They dish out benzos for the slightest little disturbance. </p>
<p>They have been on these meds for decades. No one questions it. </p>
<p>Then there’s the food.</p>
<p>The budget doesn’t allow for anything other than cheap processed rubbish. They live on chocolate and biscuits and bread. Sugar. Sugar. Sugar. They start their day with it! A spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down. They are all massive sugar addicts, the kitchen has to be locked. They have been fed sugar for years. They are all over weight and have lost teeth. Become obese in the system. All pre diabetic.</p>
<p>Fat. Drug addicts. </p>
<p>The system wasn’t really designed to ‘care’ for them. It’s designed to keep them alive long enough to keep paying the extortionate rent. £1600+ a week for a house that is falling apart and understaffed. </p>
<p>The ‘charity’ I work for is more of a housing bracket in my eyes. They have properties all over the city. There’s big money being made somewhere. It certainly doesn’t reach the actual service users. </p>
<p>The realities are somewhat difficult. </p>
<p>But I do get a huge sense of purpose showing up for my ‘service users’ … there’s a certain amount of freedom that comes with being neglected as well. </p>
<p>I haven’t worn a mask this whole pandemic. Unless I was made aware someone else was on the premises. It’s quite self regulated. No one thinks they do anything and find them frustrating. </p>
<p>I’m also not meant to hug my guys. But I straight up wrestle with one, he’s 4ft5, Down syndrome, super strong and loves to play. So we play. I hug and cuddle him. I hug all my guys. I love them. It’s hard not to have love for a human you have taken care of. We do everything for them. I care deeply for them. </p>
<p>We test 4 covid times a week, 1 pcr, 3 lfd. We’ve had 6 positive tests in total. All with zero symptoms. Zero symptoms. But the house got locked down every time we tested positive. Routines changed. One resident hasn’t left the house in a year now. A proper lockdown. Again, no symptoms.</p>
<p>The whole testing procedure is a sham. </p>
<p>I’ve actually thought about writing about my experiences in more detail and reaching out to a journalist. When I leave… which is a sad thought. </p>
<p>It’s been a fascinating look into a system I was completely unaware of before entering. </p>
<p>Loved embracing my caring side. Hated the realities of the system I’m made to be part of. Even more so now they’re trying to jab me. </p>
<p>I don’t really know what I’m gonna do at this point. </p>
<p>Just keep showing up until they stop me probably.</p>

        <p>You’re not alone. It appears healthcare work in general is going to be vaxxed only. Not that it matters, my school is requiring it and many other nearby schools as well, so I can’t even get my degree without the vaccine it appears. It’s so wrong that healthcare workers/students don’t have a say in the matter.</p>
