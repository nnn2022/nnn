<title>To everyone who feels hopeless. You haven't lost all hope. Hope is what keeps us here, on this page and this world. Physically we are seperated, surrounded and outnumbered, but at 35,000 we forget we are an army. And now is the time to act and push this back. Here is my propsed battle plan.</title>

    <strong>To everyone who feels hopeless. You haven't lost all hope. Hope is what keeps us here, on this page and this world.

    <p><p>What we all need more than anything right now is unity and a plan  to take back the rights and freedoms being attacked, maybe this is a stupid plan, but why not start here and improve as we go?</p>
<p>I  thought I had given up in the same way, that this course was set, that society was being guided by their masters through the gates of with promises of safety and enticing phrases such as "Hero's" and "Empathy" and thanking them for their "sacrifices" for the greater good.  Every time I tried to present an alternative view, people RAGED.  I realised they were defending the honor they were told they deserved for sitting quietly and doing nothing.</p>
<p>It dawned upon me that I hadn't given up when I realised, if that is the case, then why do I still go to work? Why pay my bills  or keep my savings.  Why not just spend it all on drink and drugs?  Because if i truly believe this course was set in stone and couldn't be stopped, that is accepting the future no longer holds anything of value and that my life is effectively over.  I still at my core believe a solution exists, but am so downtrodden by constant disappointment and exasperation that I didnt dare give voice to the hope even to myself.</p>
<h1>But it has to be now. There will never be a time with better odds of success to plan the return to freedom and democracy than right this second.</h1>
<p>Once upon a time, people could get all caught up in their mad  yarns and get all  hyped up by the media, an inconvient  spectable... irritating,  but we could just shake our heads and detatch and go on with  our lives. We  can' t now though, because the frenzied majorities are  coming for us, and our  loved ones, and theyre trying to take so many  of the beautiful things that makes  life worth living, and which each  new thing they attack with impunity, it empowers them to aim for the  next;   human interaction, freedom of  movement, bodily autonomy,  freedom of speech.The  reality is, our backs are against the wall.  People dont wanna hear the facts or have their views challenged,  but their lack of critical  thinking skills which got is into this  situation is also the way out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Is this all delusional? Maybe.  But who the fuck even knows what's real anymore.  All  I know is if I have to pick a delusion, its the one where we can win and be free and happy and live our lives. We know theyre delusional.  And we have handy step by step instructions on spreading delusions courtesy of our friends at the mainstream media propaganda corps.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One on one, heart to heart, we can push this back.</strong></p>
<h1>Emotions dominate reason,</h1>
<p>Do not expect them to say  2+2 is four while they are terrified of the consequences of not saying 5.</p>
<h1>Fight fire with fire.</h1>
<p>Make them realise they fear the outcome of the loss of freedom and the rise of tryanny far more than death, from covid or anything else. History  shows us time and time again that when we give  our freedom to tyrants to  feel comfort, they demand blood for their  return. This can still be  stopped without that though.Offer the hope that  we can  still reverse this if enough people are willing to upset and  anger  by standing up. Let them keep their hero's medals.</p>
<p>Start with the people who cant ignore you, who love them and who even though they dislike what you are saying, will listen if you make them.Avoid  words the media have conditioned them to respond negatively to.</p>
<p>Start  small, gently, introduce that perhaps certain people are profiting from covid.  That you are worried about the fact you know there are corrupt politicians in *Insert the part the person hates*, and that they might somehow exploit this for power.</p>
<p>Let them see your vulnerability so that they can feel strong</p>
<h1>Let them believe they are figuring it out themselves, Pander to  their insecurities so they can continue to feel superior in their  intelligence.</h1>
<p>Then in a panic show them the appaling thing youve just read.   One of the indesputable facts youve been trying to get people to look at for so long.</p>
<h1>This cant be true can it? You know more than me, what do you think?</h1>
<p>Shove in  peoples faces the  children who are trying to commit suicide, the  stories of lonely people  trapped in their own home losing their mind.   Make them sad and angry  and scared and point the finger at the  goverment and lockdown. Make them  feel like hero's for opposing it,  tell them their empathetic and caring  and superior for sticking up for  those who cant defend themselves (from  the mess they fucking created) .</p>
<h1>Pander to their need to feel woke  without really putting any effort  in. Allow them to continue to feel morally superior.</h1>
<p>Then  comes the full story, the facts that should have been all that needed  to be said,  once  peoples emotions shift, once they finished the mental  gymnastics required to believe they were never wrong about anything.  The media is powerful, but we are legion and we cannot be ignored by the  people in our lives if played correctly.</p>
<h1>We are not them. We do not need credit or recognition.  This is not about superiority or being right.  This is about preventing totalitarianism from getting a strangle hold on our world.</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>One person at a time 30,000 of us can Say what has to be said  (obviously do not lie, as soon as a lie is exposed your crediblity is  gone). Avoid wild speculation.  People dont need to know the full  reality of the situation or what you think is going on.  Stay grounded  and stick to things you can prove in a pinch.  Do not get angry, do not patronise, swallow your pride and come  from a place of concern.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>This moment right now, we are in the middle of the most important battle we will ever fight, a one of words, idea's and warped emotions,  the prize is all of the joy and beauty our lives could hold.</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Maybe we still might lose, but this last stand is worth everything we have.  If we do nothing, the   world devoles into a never ending nightmare that perhaps future generations may  look back on with shock, digust and fascination.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>There have been setbacks, but it is time to change tactics fight, tooth and nail in the battle for reality. Say what needs to be said, play whichever role you need to play.  Look to how the media manipulates people and use the same techniques to undo it.  It is possible, if we all try that we can reach critical mass reveal the media as complicit, crippling them.</h1></p>
