    <strong>London goes into tier 4</strong>
    <p><p>So this whole time, there were only 3 tiers that were publicized at all, and suddenly they announce we're in "tier 4". Are they trying to gaslight us into just expecting that this (already arbitrary) graduated tier system can extend in severity at the governments whim?</p>
<p>Or is just another test of public compliance? To make "lockdown" palatable? As in: "It's not just another lockdown, it's merely a slight extension of the rules you were following before."</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on the rationale behind this sudden decision, just because a (poorly understood) "new more-contagious strain" of an already barely harmful virus was found... SUPPOSEDLY.</p>
<p>It seems too well timed like: "Will the public willingly abandon their xmas plans on our order?" Every single other fucking week it just seems the publics compliance levels are being pushed and pushed until they'll just do whatever the gov says.</p>
<p>Its kinda funny, if it wasn't so fucking sad, and if I wasnt so livid at the gov abusing their position like this. </p>
<p>Fuck this absolute circus.</p></p>

        <p>This is just like the stupid "colour levels" for "terror threats" after 9/11 - designed to keep the population perpetually in fear of the boogyman hiding under their beds.</p>
<p>The DHS had a system of "green" "yellow", "orange", and "red" threat levels. Note that not once in 20 years has the level ever gone back to "green".</p>
<p>This will be no different. We have always been at war with EastAsia...</p>

<p>If this doesn't piss the wider populace off, not sure what will. The sad fact is, people don't seem to care. They're just hoping this lockdown will be "the one" to get rid of the virus, and push the goalposts right along with the government.</p>

        <p>The way you know that is stupid bullshit propaganda is because the kicker with covid is that it is already super contagious. That’s like... that’s it’s main feature. It’s highly contagious and non-lethal and non-serious for most people. Saying there’s a more contagious version is kind of redundant</p>

        <p>It's not really known if it is especially contagious tbh, last I saw if you live with someone who has it you still only had a 15% chance of getting it, but I stopped reading scientific papers on it ages ago so maybe it's been proven to be super contagious, who knows, don't really care.  They have as far as I can see provided absolutely zero scientific evidence that this 'new strain' is any different at all, but that's par for the course. The virus is whatever the government wants it to be.</p>

        <p>I think lots of people have had it before testing was available in the UK. I had it in May and I was ill for two months (I'm immunocompromised and have interstitial lung disease) but my ex boyfriend didn't catch it. We lived in a two up, two down typical small terraced house with only one bathroom. Slept in the same etc but I tested positive and he tested negative. Back in early March he was unwell for a week. He caught something from the hospital his mother died in. I think he probably had Covid-19 and his mother may have done as well. His father had the same illness but at that time I didn't see much of any of them.</p>

        <p>It’s an absolute joke isn’t it...and of course nothing but a coincidence that’s it’s so close to Christmas, that London spent all that time absolutely fine in tier 2, that the vaccine has suddenly been ‘rolled out’ (another formerly benign phrase that now makes me want to puke). </p>
<p>Of course it was entirely predictable and when a supposed naturally occurring crisis becomes predictable that’s when you should know it’s bull shit 🤬</p>

        <p>I'm in a Tier 4 city and I'm pissed. From what I'm seeing when communicating with people I know, they are not going to comply anyway. They might not be able to go to non-essential shops next week but they still plan to travel to see family or have family over. I'm not travelling for Christmas as I'm in a women's refuge but I cannot collect my stuff from ex boyfriend's brother as he is in a Tier 2 area which in between me and my ex. I cannot do this as my ex boyfriend's brother is very strict and goes by the Government rules always. They've done enough to destroy our lives, we couldn't even just have a nice Christmas and New Year. They had to try and take that away as well. People are starting to have enough now.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying people haven't died, many have and it's tragic. But the response is not warranted. This is life, people die for many reasons. To destroy the economies of the entire western world and imprison it's populace is a vast overreaction to say the least, and means this is obviously about something else, there is clearly an agenda here. Please do some research, and stop believing everything you see on TV.</p>

        <p>So, to clarify, the response of asking people to stay home unless absolutely necessary and to wear face masks when out to minimise the spread of a virus that does kill people and puts an extremely horrendous strain on the healthcare system, is over reacting?
The economies are the people. It will bounce back when things are able to move again. 
I’m sorry to tell you that you aren’t enlightened. You are just feeding into another agenda.</p>

        <p>1st half of your response, yep 👍 This virus is nowhere near as deadly as they are making out, and by large kills people who are already years over the average life expectancy. I'm not going to argue with you, I just suggest you read more into it.</p>

        <p>That’s absolutely not true. You walk round the city I was in this morning and no one is wearing masks in the town centre and only doing so because they can’t enter a shop without one.

        <p>I really don't know if the leadership is merely terrible or they have an agenda. If they have an agenda it begs the question "what is it" and I'm not really much of a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>But these draconian measures make no sense to me. There are so many far less costly ways the effects of the virus - which honestly does not seem to be much worse than the flu, and whose "case" count is disproportionatly reported - could be helped. But no, the govs answer is to massively restrict the freedom of its entire population, most of whom are not in any danger. And it IS manipulative how they've presented these regulations and acted on flimsy information, and fearmongered.</p>
<p>I'm honestly stunned that the vast majority of people comply. I had no idea that people loved to do what they're told this much. I fundamentally don't believe the government has a right to intefere this much in peoples lives, over a 99%+ survival rate virus. And clearly the second order effects of lockdowns are not worth it. But its practically religious fanaticism thats justifying it at this point.</p>

        <p>The problem that people have is, this is worse than the flu. It’s far more contagious and while it’s not as devastating as initially thought, it is killing people off who probably would have survived something like the flu and it is doing so far more rapidly which in turn puts immense pressure on the health sector.</p>
<p>I don’t feel asking you to wear a mask, which let’s face it, those in the Far East have been doing for far longer when ill and asking you to wash your hands more frequently and stay a little bit further away from each other is draconian.</p>
<p>What’s insane is in the UK, shutting everything down, then opening it up for the summer holidays to get people spending, sending uni students to their respective places, shutting everything down except jobs, transport and schools, then opening up to get us spending for Xmas and then shutting down again.
It’s pointless and not breaking any cycles.</p>
<p>It should have been all shut down till it was controlled then opened up again much like NZ.</p>

        <p>&rt;this is worse than the flu</p>
<p>I simply disagree. Even if its worse its not much worse. 99%+ survival rate, deaths are comorbid with other life threatening conditions, and dominate only a few main demographics. IT ISN'T WORTH IMPRISONING EVERYONE. And compared side-by-side to other illnesses by death rate, sorry, it just does not stand out. The only difference is the amount of publicity. </p>
<p>&rt;I don’t feel asking you... </p>
<p>Making people risk a fine or arrest is not an "ask". Especially for small businesses and "non-essential" workers who have a lot to lose. The burden of proof that any of those measures are necessary has not been met.</p>
<p>As for your final thoughts, imo there should be ZERO forced regulations and a targeted approach towards the demographics that are actually affected. Read the Great Barrington declaration, which is backed by many medical professionals. Nobody wants unnecessary deaths, but the destruction - and indeed deaths - CAUSED by lockdowns is unnecessary. I'm extremely tired of the messaging around lockdowns as some kind of noble sacrifice. They do more harm than good. They also obscure sight of far more sensible options (refer to Great Barrington).</p>

        <p>You don’t have to agree or disagree because your opinion isn’t fact.
What is fact is that far more people with Covid require intensive care than those with Flu and as I’ve previously said, this is putting a huge strain on the facilities already in place such as hospitals, staff and mortuaries. 
Also, with regards to Flu, people already have a fairly good immune system to it so they can fight it more easily whereas Covid is brand new. No one has an immunity to it and no one has any clue how it is going to continue to mutate. 
It could be fine or it might not but it’s worth remembering that the spread of Covid, while it might not be an issue for you, is an issue for millions of people. So, when you say “it isn’t worth imprisoning everyone” in hysterical capitals, it is. What you are saying is no one is worth me being inconvenienced for a little while.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to consider other people who plead with you to take precautions then why do you live in a society? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>You’ve already been told, nay it is logical to realise that virus’s are transmitted by particles in your bodily fluids. Stick a mask on, it lessens the spread. It can’t be clearer or easier.
Otherwise, why bother wearing them in surgery? </p>
<p>Your logic isn’t sound I’m afraid.</p>

        <p>Your opinions are not facts either and is all trite government-fed rhetoric, selectively ignoring evidence to suit your case, being utterly inconsiderate of sound alternatives. Speaking with you is a total waste of time lmao.</p>
<p>The fact that your position is so weak that you have to resort to "buh you live in a society" is a testament to how little non-rhetorical evidence is on your side. If the virus was that deadly it's effects would speak for themselves. I'd hear about way more deaths outside the lying mass media. Instead all I hear about is terrible secondary effects from lockdowns etc which people like you justify with "at least its not another covid death". </p>
<p>I find your stance truly pitiful. Enjoy your fake overblown pandemic.</p>
