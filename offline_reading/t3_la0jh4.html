    <strong>The research that isn't being done</strong>
    <p><p>The mask debate has been raging for months now, but one of the things that are very telling, I think, is the dearth of research into the potential <em>risks</em> of wearing masks. The WHO issued this list of risks:</p>
<p>‘The likely disadvantages of the use of mask by healthy people in the general public include:</p>
<ul>
<li>potential increased risk of self-contamination due to the manipulation of a face mask and subsequently touching eyes with contaminated hands;</li>
<li>potential self-contamination that can occur if non- medical masks are not changed when wet or soiled. This can create favourable conditions for microorganism to amplify;</li>
<li>potential headache and/or breathing difficulties, depending on type of mask used;</li>
<li>potential development of facial skin lesions, irritant dermatitis or worsening acne, when used frequently for long hours;</li>
<li>difficulty with communicating clearly;</li>
<li>potential discomfort;</li>
<li>a false sense of security, leading to potentially lower adherence to other critical preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene;</li>
<li>poor compliance with mask wearing, in particular by young children;</li>
<li>waste management issues; improper mask disposal leading to increased litter in public places, risk of contamination to street cleaners and environment hazard;</li>
<li>difficulty communicating for deaf persons who rely on lip reading;</li>
<li>disadvantages for or difficulty wearing them, especially for children, developmentally challenged persons, those with mental illness, elderly persons with cognitive impairment, those with asthma or chronic respiratory or breathing problems, those who have had facial trauma or recent oral maxillofacial surgery, and those living in hot and humid environments.’</li>
<li>— World Health Organisation (5 June, 2020).*</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps I have missed it, but I am seeing little or no research into any of this. Let's just take one of these: "a false sense of security, leading to potentially lower adherence to other critical preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene". This, on its own, could completely reverse any marginal positive effects from mask use, and yet we know precisely <em>nothing</em> about this risk. </p>
<p>It's almost as if the scientific community are not interested in studying this.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely. It's just another nail in the coffin of the fallacy that we are 'following the science' as if scientists are neutral actors researching every aspect of an issue. They are not. As you say, they are paid to research what governments and their agencies tell them to research and they are not going to do any research that may undermine what they have already decided is true.</p>

        <p>Very good points.</p>
<p>The masking harms more than it helps in the real world. No medical study ever done has proven that EVERYONE wearing masks stops the transmission of disease, viral or bacterial.</p>
<p>It is only when those known infectious wear masks (i.e. people actually having symptoms) that masks are show to SLIGHTLY decrease transmission of bacterial diseases. For viral? No difference.</p>

        <p>The large scale epidemiological studies show that mask use does appears to reduce transmission rather rather than increase it so the most serious point of this have already been addressed.</p>

        <p>No, the overwhelming majority of studies find no effect. Also, way to miss the point - my post was about the risks and disadvantages of wearing masks.</p>
