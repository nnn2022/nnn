<p>(type "bitchute" in the link, gets censored by reddit lol)</p>
<p>Check this out, ex-chief biochemist of Pfizer just released this video yesterday warning about depopulation and end of humanity as we know it.</p>
<p>He describes censorship in science and how academic researchers are tied to big government money that dictates what they can or can't investigate.</p>
<p>He lost many colleagues and funds, but most of them agree with him behind closed doors.</p>

<p>And here is Dr Hoffe describing the d-dimer situation (that op's link talks about).</p>

        <p>Well written and easy to understand. Surely we’re getting closer to this whole thing just being exposed? Do the billionaires and the pharmaceutical companies still reckon they can pull this off? </p>
<p>Everything moves so fast, it’s been nine days since ‘freedom day’ happened in England and on day one vaccine passports were  suggested as a possible new rule, a requirement to get in to nightclubs. By the morning that idea had grown into nightclubs and ‘other busy indoor venues’. Then restaurants. Popping supermarkets and parks into the equation a few days later, and today I heard on the BBC that all of these places and more will probably be needed for entry the end of the summer, but the dentists and hospitals will still be accessible  -for the foreseeable future. That took nine days. </p>
<p>This is a dark article. My heart sank a bit when i clicked on the links, it seems to me like it’s fairly legit, and that.. is terrifying.
I want to show this to a friend of mine who is booked for their 2nd Jab in a couple of days but I KNOW they will go bat shit crazy at me. It’s weird because I don’t even say much about it to him because I know he HATES it. I’m very selective what I try and show him, maybe four or five things a week. He’s 55 and not in good shape, which a result of the lockdown and boredom and he hasn’t been outside more than 20 times since March 2020 and that was to get into a car. Occasional exercise on an indoor bike, NO SUN. Since the first jab he’s short of breath, he’s entirely lost his sense of humour, and he’s stopped writing, he was always writing, up until a week or so after the first jab</p>
<p>If I pass on this on to him I’ll just get an angry barrage of trump QAnon tin foil hat wearing, lizard elite flat earth fake moon landing Kate Sherimani youtube researcher science denier uneducated brainwashed conspiracy theorist accusations thrown at me. He won’t even read it, perhaps the first sentence or two and then he’ll say it’s right wing fascist propaganda and tell me I’m deluded. Ah well.</p>
