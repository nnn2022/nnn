    <strong>Porto v. Chelsea: a conversation that must have taken place</strong>
    <p><p>Background: Porto’s UEFA Champions’ League tie vs. Chelsea took place last night at a neutral venue in Seville due to the fact that anyone travelling back into the UK from Portugal must undergo a ten-day quarantine period. The change of venue was intended to circumvent this. </p>
<p><a href="http://marca.com/en/football/champions-league/2021/04/05/606b651e46163fe4868b45d2.html">(Full explanation)</a></p>
<p>UEFA Executive A: The coronavirus restrictions do not allow this game to be played in the conventional fashion. Shall we postpone or cancel the game?</p>
<p>UEFA Executive B: No, we’ll fly both teams along with the coaching and medical staff to Seville and play it there. </p>
<p>A: Is there any environmental concern about chartering at least two private jets to make that possible?</p>
<p>B: Dude, that’s so 2018. Can’t even remember the name of that little Swedish girl. </p>
<p>A: Is there a risk of spreading the virus further from flying all those people to a single location, only to fly them straight back home again, then repeat the exercise a week hence?</p>
<p>B: How does that affect us?</p>
<p>A: Well isn’t it rather one in the eye for all those people who aren’t allowed to do their job because of Coronavirus restrictions and don’t necessarily have the means to charter a private jet to circumvent these incredibly sensible restrictions? Won’t they be rather resentful of these zillionaire sportsmen bending the rules in this fashion?</p>
<p>B: ¯_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
<p>A: Does it almost seem as if the best way of avoiding Coronavirus is to have a shitload of money and that the rules don’t apply if you are obscenely wealthy?</p>
<p>B: We will continue to make shitloads of money by letting this game go ahead. </p>
<p>A: LOL. </p>
<p>B: LMAO. </p>
<p>Conclusion: 2+2=4. Here endeth the lesson.</p></p>

        <p>The only problem with this post was the use of the word sensible. Substitute ridiculous and I'd agree wholeheartedly.</p>
