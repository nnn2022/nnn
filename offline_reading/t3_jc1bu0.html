        <p>"Temporary" layoffs are always an excuse to clear out older, high-cost, high-salary workers and either replace them with cheaper ones or offload their work onto other employees.</p>

        <p>I've never understood why companies do this. My job hasn't had many layoffs due to lockdowns (yet), but in the past when they've had layoffs, they've never let any of the laid off people come back.</p>
<p>What makes this even stranger is the fact we have high turnover and the work we do is very niche. </p>
<p>Why hire someone you'll have to train from scratch and is likely to leave quickly when you can rehire someone who knows they want to be there and don't need retraining on a niche job that new hires are guaranteed to know nothing about?</p>

        <p>I hate how all of these companies are using this as an excuse to cut costs, not enforce safety. Like 24 hour stores reducing hours, hotels taking away all amenities and services while still charging full price, restaurants having “limited menus”...</p>

        <p>Try flying. They’ve just cut out any food and beverage service due to ‘safety’. Except in business class. They do full service there besucase I guess covid can’t get past the curtain. I highly doubt this will ever come back and they will fall back on safety forever as an excuse to charge full price but cut services.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’ve flown a few times this summer and the airline rules are some of the most absurd ones I’ve seen. And I mean, couldn’t they just give the whole can or bottle instead of pouring?! At least give something.  Spirit Airlines (who has always charged for snacks and drinks) didn’t change this, which proves it’s not about safety.</p>

        <p>Free fact that first class doesn’t have any changes is also absurd. They say they cannot serve alcohol in coach because it’s unsafe. I’ve flow business and coach and was served unlimited wine up front. </p>
<p>Now they even charge for economy plus but took out the free alcohol (you used to get 1-2 free wines or beers) for safety. And then people will forget it was ever there and they will continue to charge it.</p>

        <p>Because companies are awful. Two months ago, my company laid off three employees who were there for 15 years, 8 years, and 6 years. They just hired someone (for a completely different job). They couldn’t have made an effort to train one of those long-standing employees to do the job? The answer was the new employee was a fresh grad so super cheap. Just awful.</p>

        <p>These companies in the end will go down in flames, high turn over rate and new cheap unskilled unmotivated workers who aren't even trained properly will only work for 3 months at most then hop to another job. In the end the quality and production hits rock bottom and managers get desperate (and toxic)...these companies are saving money short term but long term lose major profit, most of these companies lose so much long term they degrade to bankruptcy. The CEOs are making very bad short term decisions, making headaches for themselves, HR, managers, trainers, and all employees...this low level rat brain short term thinking is sloppy, it's last minute, it's disorganized and desperate. When money becomes the motivation instead of quality that's a huge red flag that closing or bankruptcy is in the long term future.</p>

        <p>Same thing happened to me. I’ve worked a part-time job on a college campus for the past few years. I was expecting to go back to work in August, but the week before they called me to say “we gave your job away to someone who is on the campus more than you are.”  I was outraged.</p>
