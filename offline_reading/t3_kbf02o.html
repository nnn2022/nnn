    <strong>Can anyone link me to reliable studies about any “long term” effects of Covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I keep hearing the rebuttal from people about how “ohh, even if you don’t die, you can have long term side effects!!”
I’ve even heard people go as far as to say that a full 1/3 of people have long term or permanent side effects, or heart/lung damage.
All the studies I’m finding lack real evidence, I’m looking for legitimate, peer reviewed studies that I can trust, to get the real numbers. I don’t doubt it causes long term problems in some people, so do a lot of viruses. Hell, I personally developed dysautonomia after contracting Lyme disease 8 years ago. (We better shut down the country so nobody gets bitten by ticks anymore!!)
But I’m looking for actual concrete numbers here, not the hysteria.</p></p>

        <p>There's no longer term longitudinal studies yet. Long covid has as much evidence right now as 5g causing covid.</p>

        <p>can someone help me debunk this? </p>
<p>I know someone who got covid and says they are now damaged for life </p>
<p>To be clear... there is nothing wrong with this person they just really want to believe this. I keep trying to tell them that there is no real evidence of this but they said the news said it so they believe it. </p>
<p>they've been complaining about these symptoms that they're now attributing to long covid since before they had covid so I know that it is part of their hypochondriac mindset and not a real after effect. </p>
<p>I know that it is part of their martyr complex (they frequently repeat that if only people knew how bad they felt they'd feel more sorry) but how can we debunk this long covid shit so people shut up about it?</p>

        <p>I don’t think we CAN, since a lot of other viruses also can cause long term side effects. It’s not unheard of, but they’re gonna continue to act like it is. My father in law had H1N1 and he said it took him several months to fully recover. It’s just apart of coming in contact with certain viruses and being a little unlucky.</p>

        <p>I know you're right. </p>
<p>I guess the media scare mongering  has them thinking that this is something life threatening when realistically any illness can cause permanent changes to your body system. </p>
<p>Since this person has never had more than an occasional cold or flu in their life this is really freaking them out. </p>
<p>I feel awful for them but also wish I could help them realize that although not pleasant what they feel is fairly normal.</p>

        <p>I grew up getting bronchitis most winters, a few times it went into the beginning stages of pneumonia. I would be sick for a couple months. Guess that’s why I’m not phased by this. I had it late last year, was definitely really sick, but just assumed it was the flu.</p>

        <p>i had a horrible pneumonia 2 years ago and also had bronchitis often. I came to realize that my lungs probably have become more susceptible to those types of infections over time for some reason and that my body has never made a "full" recovery. </p>
<p>it is what it is. </p>
<p>i can understand why people who've never dealt with that type of thing get stressed.</p>

        <p>People who have mentioned the long term effects to me have been met with a little info about post viral fatigue syndrome. Very rare, not specific to any one virus and actually my dad had it after glandular fever. Most people don't actually know that it's a thing and once I tell them it kinda debunks the scare. Tell enough people this and the crazies squeaking about it will look like crazies to everyone.</p>

        <p>Damn, it looks like your friend needs to surround themselves with better people. You sound really manipulative and are bordering on gaslighting behavior. Who are you to determine what your friend’s subjective reality is? I work in the healthcare and have seen first hand what this virus could do. Everything that you claimed is a hoax that’s dragged out by the media is actually true. Hell, I’m in my twenties and had to quit my job because I’m bed ridden because of covid’s long term effects. So how far does your experience in the field stretch? You know, given your adamant stance on the matter, you should surely be certified/licensed by some medical or scientific institution.</p>

        <p>There are none because long covid is bullshit spread by the media made up to scare people.  Do you remember kids getting kawasaki disease because of covid? Also bullshit, yet spread by the media for months with no retraction.</p>
<p>There is a syndrome which sometimes occurs after viral infections but it is no more or less common with covid than anything else.  That is the truth. There is nothing special about covid, it is a very ordinary respiratory virus that acts like a common cold or seasonal flu.  Everything else is bullshit being driven by various hidden (or not so hidden) agendas.</p>
