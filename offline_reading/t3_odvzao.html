        <p>There is manner of death and that won't be the vaccine but the side effects that lead to the death- cardiac arrest for example.<br>
There is also cause of death,  and this may mention it if it is proven that the vaccine caused the death. This latter,  is very hard to proove.</p>

        <p>This is exactly why they tested the vaccine on the old people first, as well as made sure they were priorized for the shot that was known to cause clots. </p>
<p>That way, when they die, evil people who have sold their soul for a few dollars will gladly say it was because of pre existing conditions for a extra payday. </p>
<p>I dont believe most Doctors give two craps about anyone other than themselves and their ability to make money, and alot of it.</p>

        <p>Hank Aaron was listed as a covid death and Larry King as well, both after being vaccinated.</p>
<p>A recent post by the sister of a 13 year-old said his hospital record for his vaccination caused hospitalization is listed as "covid".</p>
<p>Someone posted their vaccine adverse reaction bill not long ago, over 50k. But covid is paid for by medicare through the CARES Act. So, you can agree "covid" and don't owe a cent, or insist (which some have) on the death/injury being caused by the vaccine and owe 10s or 100s of thousands.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure there is a huge imbalance between the two.  </p>
<p>It's pretty easy to "prove" a covid death. You get infected and after a while you die. Preferably with traces of the virus still in the body, if they even require that as criteria. Having antibodies should not count as a covid death since that is only a sign of past infection. But even then, "long covid" could theoretically be used as a cause of death as it is said to cause health issues even when the primary infection is gone.  </p>
<p>However, when it comes to jab complications, how are you going to prove that it originated from the jab? You are actually expected to get sick from the vaccine. Your body is expected to contain viral particles, whether exposed to the virus or not. Unless the death happens within hours from getting the jab, it becomes increasingly difficult to prove that the death was caused by it. Otherwise it might be just marked as covid death or other natural causes.  </p>
<p>Anyway, these are just my thoughts and not professional opinions.</p>

        <p>They say that may represent 1/10. The doctor needs to make the decision to report it (and then not receive pay for their services in many cases because they listed it.)</p>
<p>In Canada, the BC Health Authority said they would not investigate vaccines deaths or injuries because vaccines don't cause deaths or injuries.</p>

        <p>So, a Dr Hoffe had vaccinated his community of around 800 and had 3 severe adverse reactions, one of which was death in a 72 year old. He tried to report it but couldn't and finally wrote an open letter. The response from all governing bodies was to threaten him for "false" information, since vaccines don't cause adverse affects.</p>

<p>\&rt;B.C. doctors could face penalty for veering from COVID-19 health guidelines: College  </p>
<p>\&rt;The warning is contained in a joint statement from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. and the First Nations Health Authority.</p>
<p>\&rt;In another open letter addressed to B.C.’s top doctor and posted last month by Vaccine Choice Canada, Dr. Charles Hoffe of Lytton makes false and unproven claims while questioning the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
