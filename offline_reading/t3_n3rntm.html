    <strong>Why do you guys think so?</strong>
    <p><p>I have a genuine question. While I don't agree with the opinions commonly shared on this subreddit (for example: masks don't work, vaccines don't work etc.). But I am wondering why people on this subreddit are thinking this way. I have had a discussion on this subreddit before, but it wasn't really a civilized discussion, for example, I was called a "god damn fucking idiot" for thinking this way. So I want to know what the reason is for people having this opinion. But I want this to be a real discussion, and I don't want anyone being called a "god damn fucking idiot" because of their opinion regarding this topic. So let me know the reasons as to why you think this way.</p></p>

        <p>Well if you look at states like Texas and Florida and compare them to states like New York and California it's pretty obvious masks don't work.  If you look at the strict locked down states compared to the open states it again is obvious lockdowns don't work.</p>
<p>Another thing that's frustrating is that lockdowns were supposed to be a very limited time to slow the spread to not overwhelm the hospitals.  Then it was to slow down deaths.  Then it's to slow down cases.  Now it's to eradicate the virus and to stop the "variants".  It's never going to end.</p>

        <p>Actually the burden of proof is on you and your camp. You all must prove masks work and the benefits of injection outweighs the risks. So far this has not been done hence the reason for this sub.</p>

        <p>Lets have it:</p>
<ol>
<li>I dont trust politicians. I dont trust big companies. I dont trust big think tanks. I dont trust science (especially when it is used to base policies on it).</li>
<li>Why the misstrust? Because Ive always been interrested in power-structures and how they work. Politicians have always lied to their population and I dont see where it stopped. What I see is, politicians and the likes are lying on a daily basis. Even straight up blatant lies.</li>
<li>We are supposed to live in a democracy, which means you are involved in the political process or better should be. Thats how I grew up, if you want change, go join a party, help a campaign you can get behind. If people disagree, you have an argument and usually you meet somewhere in the middle. BUT this is not what actually happens. If your opinion differentiates too much, you will be pushed out of the debate room.</li>

<p>Your assumptions about the "opinions commonly held" here seem based on preconceived notions and not the products of having actually read through the discussions so you'll of course understand if a few of us are a little suspicious of your mode of questioning.</p>

<p>For example, there is plenty regarding the ineffectiveness of masking using bits of old rag or those idiotic little blue ones.</p>

        <p>OP, I strongly urge you to do your research like most of have done. Let me be frank here, it was not easy to go against the grain and find these things out. You must suspend the "that can't be true" mentality and research it for yourself. </p>
<p>Socrates said it best, you must discard every belief you hold dear (that includes what you're being told), and seek out the truth through evidence, logic, deductive reasoning, critical thought and analysis. I repeat again, this is not easy, because once you go down the rabbit hole, you're not going to like what you find.</p>

        <p>Op, what are your thoughts on asymptomatic spreading of covid?</p>
<p>I ask because in the beginning of the pandemic all the politicians and everyone on the news claimed that covid spread asymptomatically. As in no signs of symptoms but you still have the virus but don't know and can spread it. This idea spread like wildfire into the minds of everyone around the world. Added an unnecessary layer of fear, because as it turns out, covid does not spreads asymptomatically, but a lot of people still believe the lie and live in fear of asymptomatic spreading.</p>
<p>The entire pandemic has seen a series of lies, exaggerations, and misrepresentations of the truth on all things covid.</p>
<p>Masks make you feel all warm and fuzzy because you were conditioned and told to believe that. The available scientific peer reviewed studies show masks to be ineffective. The package they come in even says no protection against virus. The net effect on the healthy population for wearing masks for an extended period is negative. Real science tells us this is true, junk science tells us we should "feel" different.</p>

        <p>I still believe that asymptomatic spread exists, and my reasoning for that ist, that somebody that I know got COVID by visiting a friend who simply did not know they had COVID, resulting in the person that I know being extremely sick for a week or so. Plus I've read articles claiming that asymptomatic spread does exist, just that it doesn't occur as often as symptomatic spread.</p>

        <p>Personally I'm not interested in changing anyone's mind.  In order to develop a working knowledge of how to best combat and defeat the virus, we need many tens of millions of people to volunteer to get jabbed, then let us watch them over many months and years to see what, if any, side effects develop, and how to tweak the compounds accordingly.</p>

        <p>Hi please check out these facts and draw your conclusions. Because of these facts people in this group think the way they do
Quote source swprs
"</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Lethality: According to the latest immunological studies, the overall infection fatality rate (IFR) of covid-19 in the general population is about 0.1% to 0.5% in most countries, which is most closely comparable to the medium influenza pandemics of 1936, 1957 and 1968.
Treatment: For people at high risk or high exposure, early or prophylactic treatment is essential to prevent progression of the disease. According to numerous international studies, early outpatient treatment of covid may reduce hospitalizations and deaths by about 75%.
Age profile: The median age of covid deaths is over 80 years in most Western countries (78 in the US) and about 5% of the deceased had no serious preconditions. The age and risk profile of covid mortality is therefore comparable to normal mortality, but increases it proportionally.
Nursing homes: In many Western countries, about 50% of all covid deaths have occurred in nursing homes, which require targeted and humane protection. In some cases, care home residents died not from the coronavirus, but from weeks of stress and isolation.
Excess mortality: In most Western countries, the pandemic increased mortality by 5% to 20% in 2020. Up to 30% of the additional deaths were caused not by covid, but by indirect effects of the pandemic and lockdowns (e.g. fewer treatments of cancer and heart attack patients).
Antibodies: By the end of 2020, antibody seroprevalence was between 10% and 30% of the population in most Western countries. At seroprevalence levels above 30%, a significant decrease in the infection rate was observed in many regions.
Symptoms: Up to 40% of all infected persons show no symptoms. Overall, about 95% of all people develop at most mild or moderate symptoms and do not require hospitalization. Early outpatient treatment may significantly reduce hospitalizations.
Long covid: About 10% of symptomatic people experience post-acute or long covid, i.e. symptoms and exhaustion that last for several weeks or months. Long covid may also affect younger and previously healthy people whose initial course of disease was rather mild.
Transmission: According to current knowledge, the main routes of transmission of the virus are indoor aerosols and droplets produced when speaking or coughing, while outdoor aerosols as well as most object surfaces appear to play a minor role. The coronavirus season in the northern hemisphere lasts from about November to April.
Masks: There is still little to no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks in the general population, and the introduction of mandatory masks couldn’t contain or slow the epidemic in most countries. If used improperly, masks may increase the risk of infection.
Children and schools: In contrast to influenza, the risk of disease and transmission in children is rather low in the case of covid. There was and is therefore no medical reason for the closure of elementary schools or other measures specifically aimed at children.
Contact tracing: A WHO study of 2019 on measures against influenza pandemics concluded that from a medical perspective, contact tracing is “not recommended in any circumstances”. Contact tracing apps on cell phones have also proven ineffective in most countries.
PCR tests: The highly sensitive PCR test kits may in some cases produce false positive or false negative results or react to non-infectious virus fragments from a previous infection. In this regard, the so-called cycle threshold or ct value is an important parameter.
Virus mutations: Similar to influenza viruses, mutations occur frequently in coronaviruses. Most of these mutations are insignificant, but some of them may increase the transmissibility, virulence or immune evasion of the virus to some extent.
Lockdowns: In contrast to early border controls, lockdowns have had no significant effect on the pandemic. According to the UN, lockdowns may put the livelihood of 1.6 billion people at acute risk and may push an additional 150 million children into poverty.
Sweden: In Sweden, covid mortality in 2020, without a lockdown, was comparable to a strong influenza season and close to the EU average. About 50% of Swedish deaths occurred in nursing facilities and the median age of Swedish covid deaths was about 84 years.
Vaccines: Real-world studies have shown high vaccine effectiveness in people up to 70 years of age. In some cases, serious adverse events or sudden deaths have been reported after covid vaccinations. The long-term safety and effectiveness of covid vaccines remains unknown.
Media: The reporting of many media has been unprofessional, has increased fear and panic in the population and has led to a hundredfold overestimation of the lethality of the coronavirus. Some media even used manipulative pictures and videos to dramatize the situation.
Virus origin: The origin of the new coronavirus remains unknown, but the best evidence currently points to a covid-like pneumonia incident in a Chinese mine in 2012, whose virus samples were collected, stored and researched by the Virology Institute in Wuhan (WIV).
Surveillance: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden warned that the coronavirus pandemic may be used to expand global surveillance. Many governments have restricted fundamental rights of their citizens and announced plans to introduce digital biometric vaccine passports."</p>

        <p>Mask don't work. The actual results of unprecedented mask wearing by the general public for nearly a year in almost every country on earth has clearly proven that masks don't slow or stop the spread of covid. So I don't believe that masks work because when tried by humanity, they objectively did not work. The real question is why do you still believe that they work? What evidence is leading you to believe that masks work?</p>
<p>I have no issue with vaccines. I hate the messaging behind them, and some people's religious obsession with them is quite off putting, but for me, vaccines are fine.</p>
