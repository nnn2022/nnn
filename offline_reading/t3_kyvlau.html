        <p>If we cant go back to normal even with the vaccine than what's the point. Why dont we all just die right now? If we cant go back to the way things were befor the 300% increase in suicides than society is going to die. My religion is the only reason I haven't committed suicide yet. But my depression might kill me anyways, I already had about a month of having to force myself to eat breakfast and not being able to choke down anything more for the rest of the day. I just had a panic attack just thinking about how this might never end. Life as it is right now is unlivable.</p>

        <p>Just focus on living in the present moment. They won't win, the light wins. We all just have to hang on until then. It's unbearable when you think of the future, but the future doesn't exist yet, it is yet to be written, and we all play a part in writing it. I know it's difficult to do but you have to just live in the moment. Ask yourself 'what can I do today that would make me feel better?' and do that. I know it's very limited what we can do with lockdowns but do as many things as you can.</p>

        <p>Living in the moment is the problem, this moment sucks. When you're called a murderer for visiting family members or even just wanting to breath fresh air the current moment is hell. Hope for the future is all I have left. Than stories like this come out to say that light might not be real. I just dont know how to keep going.</p>

        <p>What I mean is, at this very moment, do you have a home, warm clothes, a bed, food, water, electricity, a functioning body that can see, eat, walk etc? If so, then that's good, focus on that. Then ask yourself what action you can take in this moment to help improve things for you. That's what I do when I start to feel despairing. The despairing thoughts come from thinking about the future. Whereas in the present moment, we always have the tools and ability to cope with the moment at hand. When we think of the future, we overestimate how bad it will be and underestimate our coping skills. Also, ignore anyone calling you a murderer, they are brainwashed people who are under a spell. I spend as little time with the brainwashed as possible because it's not possible to have a normal conversation with them about this situation.</p>

        <p>I never said we don't have needs beyond food and shelter. I'm trying to help this person not fall into a pit of despair and become suicidal. My point is, as long as our basic needs are met we can function, and then find ways to get our other needs met, like people who lived through oppressive regimes did in the past. People have lived through the most horrendous nightmares in the past by doing whatever they could do to make their lives have some form of connection, hope, and joy and people have always managed this from plague times to Nazi Germany etc, otherwise the human race would have died out by now from despair. This sub isn't helping people if people are egging each other on to become despairing and suicidal.</p>

        <p>I do have all those things but than I feel guilty about still being miserable despite having all my basic needs met. I want to go out and eat with my grandma, walk in the park with my dad, go shopping with my mom, hang out at the arcade with my brother and see the faces of my friends at church, I want the things that make life enjoyable.

        <p>I know, I get it. This whole thing is a complete nightmare. I feel the same, I hate living like this, it's horrendous and dystopian. But, we can't despair as then they win. We have to find a way to survive. Think of yourself as a being of light incarnated on this earth at this time. You're a light being living a human experience and when you die you return to the light. If you died now, you'd be ended the human experience early and missing out on the future, which is still unwritten. I have found it helpful to learn from people who lived through oppressive regimes in the past. Also, are you able to do some of those things now, like go and eat a meal with your grandma, walking with your dad and going shopping with your mum? Are there laws against doing those things where you are? If there are no laws against it then absolutely just do it. Do as many things as you are legally allowed to do right now.</p>

        <p>Can you get a mask exemption? If you can't breathe properly in them then you shouldn't wear them. Unless your grandma lives in a care home can't you just go round and see her and not wear a mask? I agree it makes it miserable to go to many places with the covid madness. I just try to find small pockets of joy where I can. Like going for a walk and seeing nature then drawing it when I get back home. Picking up a book at a charity book stall. Talking to someone in a shop and finding out they're not brainwashed. That kind of thing. Small things to give us hope.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately their is no way I can qualify for a medical exemption. I dont have any health conditions that would warrant it. I can go visit my grandma without a mask. So as long as we dont go anywhere that's ok. Even just taking a walk in the park is miserable with all of the brainwashed people here, so even nature is off limits if I want to breath freely.</p>

        <p>800-273-8255 suicide prevention hotline... just in case</p>
<p>It is a difficult time for many, and I’m sorry to hear you feel this way.  I’m glad religion helps you, but I would seriously consider talking to a therapist.  What WHO was trying to say was it wouldn’t go back to normal right away, not that it never will.  The vaccine makes you immune yes, but tests have shown you can still transmit the virus.  And with new strains starting to emerge that they aren’t sure the vaccine will make you immune to, because they weren’t factors they could test for while in development, it may be a while longer.  The people of Reddit may not be always the nicest group, and I may disagree with you on many points, but I truly do just want everyone to live a happy healthy life.  Please go seek help, and just take a minute, and breath.  Depression is not an easy foe to fight, but I’m rooting for you.  Please stay safe.  It’s perfectly fine to feel guilty for basic needs getting met and yet still feeling depressed, but try to remember that you do matter, and it’s okay to have emotions that may not make rational sense, because they are by design not rational.  You are okay to feel this way.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they've been saying this for awhile.  Basically, the vaccine is useless because you still have to social distance, wear a mask, and stay home.  We are never going back to normal if these people have their way.  It's not going to stop until people say enough is enough, but I'm not too optimistic about that.  I'm so tired of this.  I really don't know how much more I can take.</p>

        <p>I see no signs of it either. People are still just lapping up all the bullshit as it spills from Boris, Hancock, Whitty et al. I do what I can to ignore everything, but it's hard when the rest of the country are still convinced they need to Stay At Home™, Keep Your Distance™, and Wear a Mask™</p>
