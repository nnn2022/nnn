    <strong>3 main issues I have with "Covidiots" :)</strong>
    <p><p>Issue number 1.</p>
<p>Actually this is a big question, who is a "covidiot". The guy who covers himself with masks and nylon in a grossery store, like those guys?</p>
<p><a href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F04%2Fdiy_masks-1024x512.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1">https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F04%2Fdiy_masks-1024x512.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1</a></p>
<p>Or someone who just looks normal and acts normal? I don't even need to provide a visual example, it's obvious. And I don't even want to enter the endless discussion about the "science" behind this. It's pretty clear that this virus is not that deadly as we all need to pretend it is. Even if it was 10 times deadlier the response to it is ridiculous and disproportional.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Issue number 2.</p>
<p>You clearly disagree with the people you call "covidiots", so why do you call your group by them?</p>
<p>Maybe to make them look ridiculous?</p>
<p>Or maybe because you simply can't find a name for yourselves that sounds cool? Because, honestly. how can you call yourself? Cowards, sheep, faucists, vaxx-addicted, air-phobes, vitamin d- deniers? And I guess, the reason you can't find a cool way to describe yourself is because actually you stand for nothing.</p>
<p>How can you describe your ideology in a positive way without mocking your opponent?</p>
<p>Let say, no one disagrees with you, sell me your "ideology", tell me what's good about it,not what's bad about others who're against you.</p>
<p>Explain me, what do you stand for, not what you stand against.</p>
<p>In case of NoNewNormal it's pretty clear, we're not just against "new normal", we are for "normal", a sane humanity as we know it, all those things that makes life worth living, like freedom, seeing people's faces, going to concerts, pubs, hugging the loving ones and breathing the air for example.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Issue number 3.</p>
<p>I was banned from participating in this group. For expressing my opinion. And it's "not cool", guys. I was also called troll by participants, but that I can understand, I don't complain. This is how a free speech works.</p>
<p>But banning, silencing and censoring? Not cool, guys.</p></p>

        <p>LOL dude, imagine how many feelings your abrasive comments hurt? Not as bad as giving a person COVID but still. It's about promoting safety and good feels in teh community.</p>
