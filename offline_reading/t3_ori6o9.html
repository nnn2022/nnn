        <p>Oh sweet summer child. Initially opening your eyes is the hardest part because you finally see the light but it's too bright and blaring to make anything out. You just know there's light.  </p>
<p>Your eyes will soon adjust as it appears the process has already begun.  </p>
<p>You are now looking out for real time 'wtf' like this, things people say. Eventually you may wonder what's going on around you and research what's on the market now.  </p>
<p>Perhaps you get curious and start to study the Medical Complex as well as Big Pharma and medicines as a whole.   </p>
<p>You run into Oxycontin (Basically Synth Heroin) peddling, eventually you piece together why heroin and fentanyl production jumped so much for the 20 years the US Soldiers have been guarding poppy fields, start to realize the Opioid Crisis was manufactured..  </p>
<p>Perhaps you're more interested in the harsh and sudden prohibition of Mind-Altering Substances in the late 60s/early 70s. Youll find out Nixon mostly used Prohibition as a tool to arrest his political opponents and dissidents such as the Hippies and Black Americans...  </p>
<p>There's many angles to add up and it all takes time. Try to find some niche topics within the hierarchy to start exploring would be my first recommendation; particular instances, companies, medications, etc.  </p>
<p>No one has pieced it all together yet I dont believe but with the Hive Mind we know enough. So just start and/or keep digging!   </p>
<p>Also don't Black Pill yourself.  </p>
<p>Life is still worth living, God is still good, and everything still has an ultimate purpose so long as you are willing to prescribe meaning to the world around you. Better yet if you feel an itch to fix things, that's where the magic happens.</p>

        <p>As you start to peel away the layers of corruption and deception of the pharmaceutical industry, you will be changed as a person.</p>
<p>They are not here to make us more healthy.  A healthy person is someone who doesn't need the medical system. They want chronically ill patients, who "need" medication in order to remain somewhat "healthy" (functional) over their lifetime.</p>
<p>It's like why can't refrigerator manufacturers make a refrigerator that lasts more than three years?  Well, they can.  But then their company wouldn't need to sell any more refrigerators.  The pharmaceutical industry is doing the same thing with our health.</p>
<p>You're only beginning to see the tip of the iceberg my friend.  Once you start peeling away those layers, you will never be the same.</p>

        <p>Why on earth would acne meds give depression as a side effect?</p>
<p>In other words, depression in a needle exists. How many other meds have that same depression-causing ingredient??? And what exactly is this "ingredient"?</p>
<p>Remember in the 1st Keaton Batman movie how Joker infiltrated the cosmetics chemicals and when different products were applied on ur face they chemically reacted? </p>
<p>Lipstick alone wouldn't do it. You had to combine lipstick with blush and foundation for the chemicals to interact in ur body to contaminate you. </p>
<p>I see no difference here, OP.</p>

        <p>Funny. Just today I wrote on this subreddit how isotretinoine (accutane) made me unable to wear contacts and caused long stretches of agonizing dry eye pain until I found the right medication and techniques to manage my issues.</p>

        <p>I've had some acne problems as a teenager. All I needed was to take natural vitamin B5 (5g a day, 10 500mg capsules). And pretty much never had acne rest of my life</p>
