        <p>It was always theater. When masks were first mandated I remember going to grocery stores and watching people wearing them under their nose or taking them off and readjusting them all the time.</p>
<p>When my work allowed us to come back I lost all faith in the mask process. We had to be masked up at all times but were allowed to take them off to eat and drink. Everyone had their containers of beverages at their desk. At lunch everyone promptly took off their mask, ate and put it back on. Whoops, now we are all cross-contaminated. The end.</p>

        <p>We've got a Branch Covidian from Rockville here, but he's mostly nice about it. Pretty sure he's just pro-shot and against the rest of the NN bs. Maybe he can give us some insight on if the businesses can be sorted (chains? Mom &amp; pop? Grocery vs hobby?)</p>

        <p>Going to an MLB game back in May was awful. Had to use this app to order food even when I'm standing next to the counter. Mask fairies up and down every section. I'm surprised they let l even let you get foul balls considering the pitcher touched the ball lol</p>

        <p>The virus spreads primarily indoors where there is poor air circulation. I feel like many people don't want to address this fact as they'd have to upgrade their building. Sanitizing a few door knobs costs next to nothing though.</p>
