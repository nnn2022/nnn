    <strong>University students- how are you dealing with this?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm 24 and was never able to get a degree, though I've wanted to for a while. I've started- but life always got in the way. Now I finally have the opportunity to go again. I've been accepted into a Neuroscience program that I've wanted to complete for years.</p>
<p>But looking at the state of colleges in the US, I'm hardly excited anymore. I was going to college to network, and study a field I've always been interested in.. but I'm scared my whole time in schooling is going to be filled with mandatory tests, masks, and other controlling, dystopian awfulness.</p>
<p>I'll admit, as a person with an abusive background.. I personally have a problem with control in general, the restrictions and authoritarianism, the thought of being 'snitched' on, reported, ect. and the mandates. That stuff really, really freaks me out. I couldn't care less about the virus.</p>
<p>The thought of feeling like 'property' gives me so much damn anxiety. Not to mention the medical-like masks make me feel so panicky when worn outside of medical settings, I'm afraid of needles (being injected into me) and other things I can't 'control' especially things pertaining to my body. I haven't even had a single Covid test throughout this because the implications freak me out. (having something put something in my body if I am not 'dangerously' sick and consenting because it's actually going to help) If people think I'm going to have an injection every 6 months or even every year, or a test every two weeks, they're crazy, that's too much for such a menial illness. The thought of it makes me so uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So- NNN college/uni students (or soon to be), what are you guys doing to avoid this kind of stuff? Should I just withdraw, throw my career plans out the window if I can't conform? Should I tell my school I'm "afraid of Covid" so I don't have to be on campus? I'm afraid I'm going to end up spending a lot of money to be miserable and scared (of restrictions) now, and I quickly need to find another path in life?</p></p>
