    <strong>The "Freedom" That We Have is Just an Illusion.</strong>
    <p><p>We have no true freedom. The freedom that the West portrays is just an fake illusion. Whether it's these lockdowns or whatever, it just shows we live in no different that a communist/dictatorship state. Anything can happen any second. 1 day we are "free" then the next day, everything is locked down. For what? For a virus that has a death rate for only 97% survival rate. How foolish! Taking people's freedom, mental sanity, and letting everyone getting economically screwed for a virus that has less than 1% death rate. How effing dumb you have to be to submit to this clownery?</p>
<p>Yes. Our somewhat "freedom" that we had, whether it was going to the gym, or just simple things like roaming around in the mall or whatever. That all is GONE. Heck, if your even walking around, these doomers will not leave you, until you put a mask on. Whatever freedom that we had, is all gone now. The doomers who have submitted themselves to the government and the elite, have just proved to the government that they can push any narrative, propaganda and they can succeed with it, no matter what. Why? Because people will blindly and foolishly submit themselves to it. The government right now is laughing at all of us and enjoying the show they have putten. They have played all of Us like the piano.</p>
<p>All this "freedom" that the west prides themselves on, is all just an illusion. All these restrictions, lockdowns, and clownery that is going on sadly, we cannot stop it. And if we try what happens? Cancel culture, censorship does it's job in destroying you. F it. In the end, it's everyone to themselves and a fight till the finish. And, F these doomers. Hell was made for you blind, foolish idiots. You ruined it for all of Us.</p></p>
