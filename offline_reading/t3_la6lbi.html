    <strong>General health is a holistic thing. It should not be centered around 1 disease.</strong>
    <p><p>Your body needs a variety of aspects to be in order for you to be healthy. This includes hygeine, vitamin/ nutrient absorption, clean air, water, etc, mental health, and more. </p>
<p>What is happening with covid is that people are putting too much emphasis on one aspect while ignoring other important things. In some cases, practices that are unhealthy to physical &amp; mental health are being promoted. </p>
<p>We've all heard the horror stories about people ignoring other health ailments out of fear of going to the doctor/ hospital because they were afraid of catching Covid. And the others who were refused care and/or surgery. After all, the covid patients are more profitable, so that's what their focus is.</p>
<p>Poor mental health not only causes an acute risk of suicide, but can lower immunity and cause a host of other long term consequences. I imagine this goes beyond what we even understand. </p>
<p>We were already living in a way that humans were not intended to live before Covid. Technology moves us further and further away from nature. Life expectancies (which you would think would go up thanks to technology) is going down. Cancer, heart disease, &amp; autism is off the charts. </p>
<p>And then there's fear of death itself. The power that we give Covid is because of being afraid to die (or killing someone else). But what happens when we create a world that we no longer want to live in? Suddenly fear of death takes a backseat. I don't think it is correct to see Covid that way anyway. "Follow the rules or die (or kill granny)" is a false choice. </p>
<p>The people who set this whole thing up know what they are doing. They know you need sunlight, vitamin C, D, etc, clean air, clean water, &amp; human interaction. They know that witholding these things makes you more pliable and more sick. </p>
<p>*Note: I was reading a book that was on a completely different subject where it mentioned that starving your body of oxygen makes you more suggestible &amp; compliant. I think this may be part of the purpose of masks. The other purposes are to limit communication through facial expressions, muffle sound (further limiting communication), and make the wearer feel diseased &amp; dirty.</p></p>
