        <p>Really? I actually found a lot of encouraging bits in that article. The vax rates for Amish are suuuuuuper low. And their skepticism is coming from <em>us.</em> They're listening to what's really going on and don't have a wave of propaganda to wade through to find it. You know they're gonna go after them, that was always the case. But that will only make the Amish dig their heels in more.</p>

        <p>Very much so, but under the headline photo states: "The COVID-19 vaccination drive is falling far behind in the deeply religious and conservative Amish communities across the U.S."</p>
<p>The statement alone shows the Amish are also a targeted group for vaccination, and a symbol of hesitancy, from abcnews' perspective.</p>
<p>My post was a joke that I made up. Abcnews isn't joking. I was not looking to find that article and it came up afterward on a random google search.</p>
<p>Quotes like "The vaccination drive is lagging far behind in many Amish communities across the U.S. " are a little concerning that the authors of the article feel that the COVID vaccine is so special compared to other vaccines, when this has been the Amish traditional stance for a long while even with vaccines. This is part of their heritage and culture.</p>
<p>So COVID is going to change the Amish cultural principle, now, after 300+ years? It just shows that no cultural group is safe from these invasive polices and perspectives.</p>

        <p>Yeah, man. I have a bit of a complicated relationship with the Amish, since I grew up with them and my dad has had so many as clients. I mean, our family's wealth is pretty much down to the Amish, there's no arguing that. But they can be pretty weird, man. A lot of them act kinda alien sometimes. But there's also a lot of things I really like and respect about them. They are just so unlike anyone else.</p>

        <p>Yeah I guess my point on the matter is that vaccination has become so serious for many people, that it's getting overly invasive, and the media is an orthodox adherent to drill everyone into submission of acceptance, without even historical or cultural principle considerations.</p>
<p>Another satirical excessive, austere vaccination Don Quxiote esque like "crusade" example would be sending "vaccine missionaries" to the remote ends of some native north American arctic circle culture to vaccinate the most remote communities that are fully off the grid, don't interact with modern society, and don't even know wtf is COVID.</p>
<p>Feels like the most neo-colonial actions a society can impose on another people &amp; culture, when we've been preaching to respect sensitivity of other cultures and to respect their traditions for so many years now.</p>
<p>However, if COVID is here that principle goes right out the window.</p>
<p>Just highlighting the hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>All from the rationale, a couple years prior, blaming anti-vaxxers and kids getting whopping cough or mumps from parents not vaccinating. </p>
<p>Legislatures also tried in NJ but people protested in Trenton. I never even knew you could ask for a religious exemption until I met friends a couple of years ago whom were never vaccinated as kids, and were given exemption to go to public school.</p>
<p>Religious exemption in some states doesn't have to be based on god, or religious dogmatic ties. It can be a basic atheistic/agnostic moral philosophical held belief as well.</p>

        <p>There were several Amish communities where I grew up.</p>
<p>My dad made a lot of them his clients. I've been to Amish weddings, barn raisings, used to drive them around for their construction jobs too.</p>
<p>They are all super nice and friendly and very good hearted people. Humble. Stoic. Unbelievably hard workers. But man...they are weird. And they smell like you'd expect people who have no modern conveniences to smell.</p>

        <p>It's intentional. In the Amish community, pride is the biggest sin of all. They are <em>extremely</em> vigilant about pride. They don't have mirrors, they don't get their pictures taken, and their dolls aren't allowed to have faces. The plainness, the uniformity, it's all designed to kill pride and ego. It's also why their communities are insanely tight-knit. If you've ever watched them raise a barn or even just a build a regular house...it's something to behold. They're almost like ants when they work.</p>
