    <strong>What’s the point?</strong>
    <p><p>Let me give you an example of a conversation I have with most people</p>
<p>Me: “the government locking down has destroyed the economy, many small businesses, has ruined your marriage, taken away many of your rights and they’re going to make you take a vaccine for a virus you will almost certainly survive”</p>
<p>Them: “nah, we must beat the virus!”</p>
<p>We’re in such an absurd situation, we have to convince people that they’re lives are being attacked - I mean, just how strange is that?</p>
<p>In the UK, every time they put in new restrictions I keep saying “this is it, the people have had enough” but that’s never happened once and will NEVER happen - they could restrict us to our beds and people would take it</p>
<p>We’re in a crises where we can’t even focus on getting rid of it, because we need to convince people that they’re in a tyranny in the first place. </p>
<p>Look, let’s not kid ourselves, we’re in the minority - there will be no revolution, no rebellion, we’ve lost and I’m not even mad, the modern populace doesn’t want freedom and I don’t want to fight for them, this rhotic is here to stay, forever</p></p>

        <p>People don't really grasp statistics or care enough to make relevant comparisons. Their reaction is proportional to the amount of panic they see around them, even when it's clearly manufactured. Add peer pressure and government mandates and this is what you get.</p>

        <p>Agree, 'Boris has cancelled Xmas' no he hasn't we the people have cancelled our own xmases by playing along, and when I try to get angry with 'the people' it's fruitless when there's SO MANY who are still happy with this.</p>
<p>There's no exit soon from this, the businesses can't open, the government can't save face, the people can't decide what's real or not. </p>
<p>They could start relaxing things in April, we'd all slag em off and say it was all for financial reasons, so they won't do that. </p>
<p>Summer with better weather will see a downturn in 'cases' , but it did this year and that offered us nothing. </p>
<p>Realistically what exit strategy would work for all?!? </p>
<p>Me, I just scrap it off, we know the risks, back to normal do what you need to do to open up and take your own risk assessment for you and yours. 
But, gov would look like fools, travel to other counties would die, folks would all be terrified, businesses worry about being owed down for outbreaks.... </p>
<p>1st step has to be, stop testing unless by a doctor or hospital due to illness requiring attention. </p>
<p>Let's see how that affects 'cases' plough funding into healthcare if admissions rise.</p>

        <p>This is what is called in psychology as “the bystander effect.” They have created experiments where 3 people sit in a room, and smoke from a fire floods in below the door. Because nobody gets up to panic or warn someone, none of the participants do. There’s a literal fire and they do nothing, because that’s what everyone else does.</p>

        <p>I think the new fear is "long term effects" ? I think most people know rationally that they will not die, but they think they will have damaged lungs for life.

        <p>Don't be too sure about that. My doctor, who is AGAINST the masks and lockdowns, has said it is frighteningly common when they look that there is long term lung damage in people who have had CoVid-19 who think that they 'have had no lasting effects'.</p>
<p>He says it is about 1 out of 4 people who have long term lung damage, they just do not notice until they get another illness.</p>
<p>Though that is much like the flu I had in 1990 (when I was 10) that the doctor had to monitor me for 6 months due to him finding occlusions on the x-rays 1 month after my parents and I thought I had 'fully recovered'.</p>

        <p>UK too OP.</p>
<p>There were MASSIVE protests in london last weekend and they got no coverage by MSM. it would be counter productive for them to show them.</p>
<p>I think this may be the last one. Best thing to start doing is not wearing your mask. The worst that happens is people look at you funny and staff ask if your exempt. You have to prove nothing to anyone</p>
<p>The more people do that, the more visible it will be that less people are going along for the ride.</p>
<p>Most people I know will not be obeying lockdown rules and will be visiting whoever they want.</p>
<p>If they try lockdown again people will just keep doing what they want. There will be a point where even the most staunch advocates of this ridiculousness will wake up and go.... well yes, it is shit that a lot of old and ill people have died but the amount of healthy people who have died is tiny relatively speaking. Then when that happens we can got back to normal.</p>
<p>Like proper normal not this shit the media say about 'there is no new normal' 'masks are here to stay blah blah' </p>
<p>These conversations are taking place all over the country privately people are just scared of rabid oppression to post these thoughts on line.</p>

        <p>Then why do I see no masker changing their mind? It’s simple to say “I don’t wear a mask so I’m going against lockdown” but maskers don’t give you a funny look, they give you a look like you’re about to murder their entire family.</p>
<p>After every announcement from Boris, Twitter is bombarded with people saying how easy Boris is and how he is anti lockdown and we should all be strapped inside our beds.</p>
<p>Not complying with the rules isn’t making people change their mind, it’s making them think you’re a crazed gunman who wants to kill everyone in sight</p>

        <p>That may be because your basing this on twitter and the media.</p>
<p>Talk to actual people. They're all sick now. A few weeks ago I was saying that most of the people I know irl just go along with it but now, because of other lockdowns they dont care anymore. </p>
