        <p>Lol they couldn’t have picked a worse “whistleblower.” I’m just gonna leave this here from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Jones has had prior criminal charges. At the time of the police raid, Jones was facing an active misdemeanor charge for allegedly cyberstalking and sexually harassing a former student and romantic partner who'd got a restraining order against her. The cyberstalking complaint stemmed from a revenge porn site Jones allegedly created and shared with the man’s family and employer. She was fired from her Florida State University teaching position for threatening to fail her estranged romantic partner’s roommate. She had also faced prior charges stemming from an alleged violation of that restraining order (charges included felony robbery, trespass and contempt of court for violating a domestic violence injunction), but those charges were dropped. Prior to that incident in 2017 Jones had been arrested and charged with criminal mischief for vandalizing her former romantic partner’s SUV, but those charges were later dropped, as well.</p>
<p>Jones also faced criminal charges in Louisiana in 2016, where she was arrested and charged by the LSU Police Department with one count each of battery on a police officer and remaining after forbidden and two counts of resisting arrest after refusing to vacate a Louisiana State University office upon being dismissed from her staff position.</p>
