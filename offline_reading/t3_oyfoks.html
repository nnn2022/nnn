    <strong>What you can do to fight back against this bullshit....and get our freedoms back</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>Keep refusing to get vaccinated. I never will.</li>
<li>Avoid all left-wing news media. The more you watch/click on/read, the more money they make the more power and influence they have. Watch/click on/read SUPPORT those who are speaking out against mandated vaccines, vaccine passports, removal of our freedoms etc. even if you don't agree with much of their stance on other issues -- at this point, fighting back against tyranny and fascism has to be our main goal.</li>
<li>Stop patronizing any company that announces mandatory vaccines for employees/vendors etc. This week alone, I've dumped Netflix, Google, Microsoft, and a slew of smaller businesses. Then let them know why you've dumped them. (I do still run YouTube (Google-owned) but with AdBlock on every video, so it costs Google money for me to watch their videos).</li>
<li>Support those businesses speaking out against vaccine passports, mandatory vaccines etc. In particular, support small businesses as they are not usually the ones mandating how people treat their own bodies.</li>
<li>Speak out against this bullshit on any social media platform you use. Get banned, find another platform but never ever ever shut up or be frightened into not using your voice.</li>
<li>Message your politicians and tell them "Mandatory vaccines? Vaccine passports?" hope you will enjoy your retirement after the next election". I used to work in political fundraising, and it has been thought for years that, for every 1 email/letter/phone call a politician gets, they believe 500-1,000 other people think that way". Your one voice <strong>is</strong> important.</li>
<li>Stop consuming things you don't need. The more you consume, the stronger the economy stays the longer this bullshit will continue. The faster the economy fails, the faster this bullshit will end as Democrats and the other fascists now in government will have more important things to think about than 'mandatory vaccines' (and sadly, a failing economy will impact millions of people BUT...we are in a fucking war, so there will be casualties -- compared to mandatory vaccines/vaccine passports,however, those casualties will be minimal).</li>
<li>Avoid visiting any state/city/town mandating vaccines for eating out, shopping, entertainment etc. And, if you can't find one, stay at home and save your money.</li>
<li>Do not allow your children to be vaccinated against your will. Even if that means they cannot attend school. Home school, get together with a group of other like-minded parents and take turns in home schooling etc. There are always ways out of mandatory vaccines for children, even if it means moving state. Because...honestly, if these 'vaccines' end up causing lifelong health problems, at least you won't be the guilty one having allowed your child to be given one.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are thousands of things you can do to fight back against this tyranny. The secret is to do it every day and NEVER EVER EVER GIVE UP.</p>
<p>Feel free to add anything you are doing or have thought of doing to fight back, so we can all get back to the 'old normal' as fast as possible.....and then we need to kick all of these fascists out of office for ever thinking we would all roll over and just take this.</p></p>

        <p>Fantastic ideas! We need more threads like this. I’ll add a few more: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Diversify your income. The only reason they’re mandating through private companies is because they know that we mostly live off of one company. If you have less dependence upon the state and its favored corporations; you have more autonomy. You can’t be coerced as easily. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start growing your food. We may be playing the long game on this one and it takes a few months before you get anything. This is a lost skill that we should all be practicing so that supply chain threats and access to grocery stores aren’t a threat that can be held over our heads. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember you are a walking campaign for our movement. Don’t be a wild Karen just yelling about vaccine this, vaccine that. Be clear, be thoughtful. One administration should not be able to inject 300M citizens. A tyrannical state never stops consuming freedoms - even the freedoms of its supporters. Show them the big picture so that they understand it could be them next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dry tf out of the economy. I’m serious. It’s the only way to turn corporate greed on and have them push the government. If companies are seeing massive fall out in revenue, they’ll go looking for new revenue. They’re greedy MFs and sometimes that’s helpful to use their greed to your advantage. They advocate for your choice when your choice means money for them. Buy food from local farmers or smaller food shops. Not Walmart. Not target. If they require a mask or vaccine, don’t go there. Go revitalize the businesses that wouldn’t comply with the state mandates. Do not shop at big chains. Take a year to go only to thrift stores or swap with friends. The best way to advocate for yourself is by using your dollar.</p>
</li>

<p>Thanks for the excellent list!</p>
<p>And yep. The only reason any of these companies are mandating vaccines is because they think it will make them more money from the Karens demanding vaccinations. Other than that, they couldn't care about vaccines and care even less about their employees' health.</p>
<p>The minute you support them with your money, they've won. The less money they make, the faster they change their mandates and, again, make sure you tell them why you stopped using their services/buying their products.</p>

        <p>I love the one about not being a walking Karen. If you come off as unhinged, it will be easy for people to dismiss you even if you have valid points. I try to ask questions instead: “what do you mean when you say ‘trust the science?’” “I know we just sued J&amp;J in NY for their role in starting the opioid crisis. How do I know this product is completely safe?” “Can you show me the data you are referring to on asymptomatic transmission?”</p>

        <p>I cannot agree more with this last point especially! Support small businesses even if it cost more! Spread out the wealth, watch where your money goes, pull outta big business stock, shop at the local farmers market. Nows the time to support small businesses more than ever.</p>

        <p>I actually made a negative comment on the social media of a financial institution the other week, which then caused them to flip out and actually CALL ME. Because yep, they hate bad reviews as many would-be or current customers pay attention to them.</p>
<p>I refused to answer their call, messaged them telling them to stick their services up their ass, and then closed my account with them anyway.</p>
<p>EDIT: In my case, they lost tens of thousands of dollars of my money, but do NOT mandate vaccines and then CALL ME uninvited and beg me to stay with your company when I have already told you I wouldn't touch your services with a 10 foot pole due to your vaccination stance.</p>

        <p>Haha nice! It takes 5 second to do. Easy when you work from a computer all day. </p>
<p>My sports talk radio host and I got into it last week after I texted him and called him a liar for spreading misinformation when he falsely equates playing football for millions to getting a vaccine. Then said, it’s almost impossible to catch the virus when vaccinated. </p>
<p>Didn’t think he would respond, but he did to the PCR test recall saying, “I didn’t know that.”</p>
<p>It went back and forth for a few days and after multiple truth bombs and an automated message from the station saying my message was received he texted, “wrong number man.”</p>
<p>It works. Sorry about the novel!</p>

        <p>Thanks! I do a lot more things than just this, but didn't want to overwhelm people :)</p>
<p>Plus, so many people must be doing things I'm not, so I figured I'd learn something if I shared  mine and they shared theirs.</p>
<p>If we all get together and stick together, we can have an enormous impact. Look at what Reddit users managed to achieve with GameStop stock, and what they are now doing with Robinhood :)</p>
<p>EDITED: to make my thoughts sound clearer.</p>

        <p>Great list OP and additions from jaejaeok. </p>
<p>I’ve been trying to remember through all of this “don’t but into the divide and conquer bullshit.”</p>
<p>I used to think people who masked up outside were idiots. I had to realise that they were merely acting on the information they were given. </p>
<p>It’s not the maskless’ fault we have ridiculous lockdowns 
It’s not the unvaccinated’s fault. </p>
<p>It’s the risk-averse pandering politicians fault.  We need to stop pointing the finger at each other and direct it toward the cause. </p>
<p>I’ve also been trying to spread positivity in the community. </p>
<p>There was one person close to where I live who turned their from garden into a full vegetable patch. I wrote a little note to say how great it was to see their garden grow and left a coupla bottles of beer. </p>
<p>I do this to a lotta folk with nicely tended gardens now. They’re usually older folk too. So it’s indicating that they are not alone. </p>
<p>Even though mask mandates are no longer here, a lotta people in shops wear them and often I’ll get a scathing look because I’m maskless. I give them a great big, genuine smile n nod and every once in a while their scornful face changes and I can see their eyes smiling back.  </p>
<p>On the not supporting vaccine mandating companies, maybe try making your own bread. I’ve been sourdough baking since the start of all this and as well as being tasty it saves quite a bit of money too. </p>
<p>Fermenting veg to store - sauerkraut, kimchi, honey fermented garlic, beet Kvass, whatever. There’s tonnes you can do. </p>
<p>Make your own sodas - ginger beer, lemonade, elderflower champagne, kombucha. 
All super simple. </p>
<p>Go full on Earthy Crunchy. </p>
<p>Anyhoo, this too will pass, and we can make it better.</p>

        <p>You can download it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://adblockplus.org/">https://adblockplus.org/</a></p>
<p>and then install it.</p>
<p>Once installed, you will see a red icon at the top right hand side of your browser. AdBlock will then run on every website you go to including YouTube.</p>
<p>If you want to turn it off for specific websites, ie: websites you want to financially support, click on the red icon and choose 'Always' that will then mean ads will run on that particular site from then on.</p>
<p>Hope that helps?</p>

        <p>I'm just going to leave these resources here...</p>
<p>America's Frontline Doctors has a form with a list of questions to ask your employer about mandatory vaccines. See the vaccine letter template here: https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/60956cfa67d1ea346b32336b_Vaccine-Public-Letter-5.pdf</p>
<p>Catherine Austin Fitts also has resources about employment vaccine recommendations, too. https://pandemic.solari.com/form-for-employees-whose-employers-are-requiring-covid-19-injections/</p>
<p>Both resources are basically the same questions, with legal citations to back up each one.</p>

The other will be those of us 'Outlaws', on the outside forever. We will either drop out of society in rebellion or just be forced out by never ending demands and restrictions.</p>

        <p>The elites/power structure want a violent pushback right now.  It will fulfill their white supremacist/patriots are dangerous prophesy.  Perhaps you feel it is time to begin to plan that.  However, short term it may be best to stay frosty.  If you feel powerless or want to feel like you are moving toward an anti-elite goal, here are a few suggestions for your action/energy: </p>
<p>Grow a garden, learn about which plants do best in your area </p>
<p>Invest in a high quality firearm and become proficient in it's use </p>
<p>Read more</p>
<p>Invest in a small but effective emergency solar backup setup for your home or vehicle </p>
<p>Go to the gym or start a regular workout regimen </p>
<p>Make a commitment to a better diet, learn about the importance of vitamin D and many other great additions and components of healthy nutrition</p>
<p>Organize with your neighbors face to face, figure out how to communicate when the power grid goes down or a natural disaster happens in your area.  Create a "safe word" or phrase even, so your network of neighbors can communicate under pressure</p>
<p>Learn how to can/preserve food</p>
<p>Build an emergency food and fuel supply, start with enough for at least one month of food and water per person in your household</p>
<p>Cancel your Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. subscriptions </p>
<p>Buy and support local from people and businesses that support your freedom of choice</p>
<p>Show compassion when and where you are able.  Divide and conquer is the tactic at use against us all, compassion and realizing that we are in this struggle together will help neutralize it</p>
<p>Understand that you are not alone in how you feel, THERE ARE MILLIONS OF US IN THIS MESS TOGETHER.  Find one of us and start networking so we can build a more effective resistance</p>
