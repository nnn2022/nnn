    <strong>Want your liberty back? JAB YOUR ARM!</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone not questioning the official narrative and the lies of our government goalpost shifting and infringement of human liberty is beyond help at this point. UK summer re-opening was to give the populace hope of a return to normal but it also constructs the way to the conformity of the vaccine.</p>
<p>You must be vaccinated to participate in the summer re-opening. We have behavioural scientists who know and study this. Most are that desperate for a sense of normality that they will take this vaccine. but not for their own personal health rather, a return to normality. This is the dangerous precedent that most seem to miss.</p>
<p>I would argue most under 50 aren't taking the vaccine for their own personal health rather a shortcut to normality.</p>
<p>The precedent is that the government can declare a crisis (whether the populace agrees with the description of the crisis", revoke your liberty and refuse to return them until you conform to whatever it is they desire.</p>
<p>If they can do this once, this will do this time and time again in other aspects of your personal liberty. This is way deeper than just taking a vaccine.</p>
<p>Most would argue that a vaccine passport is a right way forward, we're were never free anyway! You need a passport to travel anyway so what's the harm in taking the vaccine? Well, Karen, I do not need to inject my travel passport into my arm now, do I?</p></p>

        <p>What's the reasoning for "jabbed only"? Is it like for the sheep's own safety? Or are the jabbed supposed to be less of a hazard?</p>
