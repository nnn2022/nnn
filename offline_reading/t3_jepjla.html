    <strong>Mexico 1 month anniversary: I’ve spent $1000 usd on starting a new life here :)</strong>
    <p><p>Hello again, just a quick post to let you all know that I’m working and I’m happy. </p>
<p>I did my monthly budget this morning and even with the low pay ($7/hour), I’ve managed to only spend $1000 to set up my new life. This covers <em>everything</em> I’ve spent since I arrived. Food, travel, fiber optic internet, rent, entertainment, etc. I brought $2700 in savings and I’m so grateful I still have most of that in my account. </p>
<p>To be fair I rarely eat out and I don’t drink, smoke, or use drugs. Most of my expenses are on the usual things you can’t pack in a small suitcase, like kitchen utensils and extra blankets/pillows. Also I recently adopted the sweetest adult cat, so of course all the pet things are included in the $1000. </p>
<p>I live in a secure, gated community that’s quiet and filled with trees, bike paths, and friendly neighbors. People are living their normal lives here and it’s just a relief to live a drama free existence. My Spanish continues to improve and I sincerely enjoy my job. </p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted to let you all know that it’s possible to move here, and it’s definitely the cheapest move I’ve ever done. Happy to answer any questions you may have, and Peace.</p></p>

        <p>I’m in a mid sized city called León, which is in the state of Guanajuato, about 4-5 hours north of Mexico City. It’s pretty much in the middle of the country.</p>

        <p>Nice! I studied abroad for three months in the Yucatán peninsula. It was so beautiful there. Everything was so much more affordable.</p>
<p>Ever since COVID started I’ve half jokingly thought about moving to Mexico.</p>

        <p>The city is very safe. It’s just the norm here for middle class folks to live in a gated community. The area has several all around the outskirts of León where I live. The only place you don’t see them is in downtown León, which is about 30 minutes away from where I live. So I’m basically in a suburb.</p>

        <p>This is actually my second time in Mexico. I lived here for a few months in 2018. </p>
<p>When the lockdowns got bad in California this year I researched the lockdown policies in Mexico and learned that it really varies by state. That’s what cinched it for me. A combination of moving to a Mexican state with (close to) zero lockdown/quarantine polices, along with a culture/language/people I already liked and respected. I also have local friends here so that was a big deciding factor as well.</p>

        <p>That's definitely the most drastic "Escape from California" story I've heard (as opposed to all the people moving to Texas). I'm glad it's working out well for you! Out of idle curiosity, what kind of job did you find?</p>

<p>There's a reason they put the fear porn out there about "dirty, disgusting place with murderous cartels just looking for pale faces to rob, rape, and murder!!"</p>

        <p>I started volunteering through Workaway. That took up 25 hours a week but gave me enough time to start job hunting. I applied to a popular (in Mexico and South America) online English company called Open English and (thank heaven) got the job. I should add that I’m an English teacher by profession. I’ve taught ESL in the US, Italy, China, and Mexico, and I also have an MA in English with an emphasis on literary studies. I’m hoping to start teaching in person once schools are open here. From everything I’m hearing, things will be fully open in January. I’ve already seen some job ads for English teachers but they all say “temporarily online” so I’m sticking with open English for now. </p>
<p>I should add that outside of the schools everything is open and back to normal in the state where I live. Other states are more strict, in fact there’s a group of expat doomers in the state of Quintana Roo losing their minds every time the governor talks about loosening restrictions. Lucky for me people here in Guanajuato are more reasonable (and there’s less expats)</p>

<p>Gotta love the Doomer idiots that move to a place that's different, expecting it to be exactly like the shitty place they recently left.</p>
<p>Go back to the States if you like such idiocy.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately a lot of expats who move here really want to bring the US with them. I have the same problem ofc, it’s hard to let go of the familiar, but my local friends are teasing me about my American ways, so I doubt I’ll be clinging to them for much longer 😂</p>
<p>Where I’m different from most US expats is I am seeking employment with a local school. It’s really rare for expats to do that here because the pay is super low. You definitely have to lower your standard of living from what you’re used to in the US, and that’s not an easy thing for most people to do, myself included. That said, I’m trying. Hey this week I finally learned how to use the half-broken washing machine in my building, so I call that progress :)</p>

<p>I grew up poor having to carry my clothes to and from the coin-operate laundromat...from Kindergarten on.</p>
<p>It's only now in my later years (middle age) that I've got a small amount of success (again, small biz owner).</p>
<p>I also wouldn't be one of those entitled douchebags that go to another Country and then try and destroy it with my idiot Countries' ways.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the people who claim to went to Jamaica for vacation...but stayed in a fenced-in compound and talked about how great the "servants" were.</p>

        <p>Yeah most of the neighborhoods I’ve lived in here I’m always the only white person. But that was true in China as well. I just always seem to end up in that situation 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

        <p>Not a bad thing, man. I bet you get a ton of respect being the minority and attempting to assimilate to their cultures, speaking their language, etc.</p>

        <p>They put school on TV for the fall semester. It’s actually kinda cute. </p>
<p>As for their reasoning... I’m not qualified to answer that question. I will say that it’s near impossible to teach in person right now, but at least in Mexico they’re pushing for schools reopening in the spring. In California they’re definitely staying online through the end of the year.</p>

        <p>Interesting. I'm planning on expatting when I retire but had scratched Mexico from my list due to the constant stories about crime and political instability. I may have to re-think that.</p>
<p>I do have a few questions:</p>
<p>- Did you speak Spanish before you went? I can't speak it but certainly am willing to learn.</p>
<p>- What size (rooms, square footage) is your place? Comparison with an apartment or condo here Canada or US)?</p>
<p>- Do you own a car? Is it difficult or expensive to bring one in or purchase one there? (I'm Canadian, so driving is an option for me - it would be a fun trip).</p>
<p>- My pension from my employer will be around 3500/month in Canadian dollars. I assume I can live comfortably on that? I'm not looking to live the tourist lifestyle - ideally just I want to find a nice local watering hole, meet the locals and learn Spanish, read, draw, paint, and sip wine on a patio, nothing fancy.</p>
<p>I have many more questions, but I'm not going to bombard you here. Would you mind if I messaged you?</p>
<p>Edit: Lived in Europe for 4 years, have travelled all over Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia (not 4-star tourist style) so I'm not a neophyte at adapting to new places.</p>

        <p>Sure, you can message me, but I'll answer your questions on here as well.
I studied Spanish for about a year before I left the US, but it was honestly a lot of reading and writing, so while my reading level is high, my speaking/listening isn't so great. I have found a few people here who are willing to do conversation exchanges so I'm hoping to improve.
I share a 2BD/2BA apartment with a roommate. I don't know the exact square footage but I'd call it pretty big. The bedrooms are large, we each have our own bathroom, and there is one large main room with the living room on one side and the kitchen on the other. In comparison to California apartments I'd say this one is slightly bigger, with tons of windows and a nice balcony, and as a bonus it's like a townhouse - it's a freestanding building with no neighbors, which is nice :) It doesn't have a washer/dryer - the apartment complex has a laundry room.</p>
<p>I don't own a car, but friends have told me that it's not difficult to bring a car into Mexico. I do know that you have to get a Mexican license if you stay here long term, but I'm not sure what the process is for that.</p>
<p>I think 3500/month is plenty, but I also think the problem with being an expat here is you can easily spend money. I'm 49 with a bad back and I just about died sweeping and mopping the tile floor of this big lovely apartment tonight. So if you want a maid for that sort of thing, and nice meals out, and ordering things from amazon you can't get here, etc., that 3500 will go quick. It's really all about the standard of living you set for yourself, and since you're a world traveler, you're probably fine with roughing it a little.</p>
<p>I do want to emphasize that I'm a middle aged woman traveling alone, I've been all over Mexico and I've never had any problems with crime, etc. It does help that I speak Spanish and I don't drink. I'm also old so I'm not out at all hours. I lived in China from 2016-2018 and while it is a safer country if you go by the statistics, I honestly feel safer in Mexico, just because the people here are incredibly warm and welcoming, especially when they find out I'm traveling alone. I also feel like people are willing to really talk to me about things - life, the universe, everything, and I love that about this place. It's been very easy to make friends here.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your really informative posts. My partner and I will move to Mexico. From our research León is one of our favorite cities, so looking around reddit, we found your post and very much appreciate the insight.</p>
<p>We speak Spanish and have spent time in Mexico before. This time, we're planning on 4-5 months. We just want quiet, pleasant, relaxing. Great food. Maybe nature or pretty neighborhood. A gym would be nice. Like you, no parties, bars, drinking, drugs.</p>
<p>Could I ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>- <strong>Apartment</strong></p>
<p>How is the process to find an apartment in a gated community? Easy, hard? </p>
<p>How is a 3-month rental period considered: is it difficult to get under 1-year, is it easy to find a 3-month deal, etc. I understand you're living with a roommate (who had the apartment already?), but for us, we'd be searching for a place to be living alone.</p>
<p>Other than AirBnB, booking.com, etc, what sources would you suggest?</p>
<p>- <strong>Transportation</strong></p>
<p>We don't want a car. How walkable is the area? Ideally, we'd love to be able to walk everywhere for everything: shops/market, nature, pleasant strolls. What do you think?</p>
<p>- <strong>Neighborhoods</strong></p>
<p>Any specific areas you'd suggest?</p>
<p>- <strong>Covid restrictions</strong></p>
<p>How is the current situation regarding restrictions? As I understand, it's common to have temperature checks, mask requirements, and sanitizer at all stores and public places. Is that right? We care most about - and want to avoid - restrictions on movement, store closures: is there any lockdown restrictions now? What is the political climate, how likely do you think it is for lockdown restrictions to be imposed?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thanks for your insight. It's wonderful to get your insight as someone who's actually there and knows the current situation :-)</p>
