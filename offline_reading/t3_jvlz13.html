    <strong>Has anyone here had the virus?</strong>
    <p><p>I got sick 2 weeks ago, nothing major. Minor fever and chills, throat hurt like a mother (turns out my unlucky ass had a giant canker sore on my soft pallet, which those can be caused by an immune response).</p>
<p>I had to take a test because my job mandated it, and I got the rapid test. While I was waiting for the results, which took a couple of days, I didn't feel sick really, just really tired. And my appetite was gone for the entire week. I wasn't nauseous or anything, it was just like someone turned it off.</p>
<p>My results came back negative (but we know how accurate those are lol) and I kind of just told everyone I had the flu. But I've had the flu before, <em>bad</em>. This didn't feel like the flu. It was way less minor and left me in more of a tired fog than anything. A few people I've known personally who did test positive had the same symptoms as me, so I'm honestly pretty positive I did have it.</p>
<p>If that's really all the virus does, that's a really weak ass virus.</p></p>

        <p>I refuse to get tested but I was partying with a group of friends over the past several months and all of them have contacted it at places I was too. Like we went on a trip and one of them got it there (got sick and tested positive) and I was in close contact with him the whole time. Or over July 4 a couple of them got it at the party we went to but I didn't get sick.</p>
<p>I never got even a little sick those times so I don't know.</p>
<p>I did take a 13 hour international flight recently and got sick though when I got to the destination but could just be the cold, I got over it in 2 days.</p>
<p>Honestly it's fairly suspicious I haven't gotten it, I've taken probably 10+ driving/plane trips, partied with random people from random places, go to the gym every day, eat out a few times a week. When I vacation somewhere with bars open, I go out. And as I said I have been around the virus, confirmed.</p>
<p>I was in NYC back in March riding subways, in crowded European cities right before that, nothing. Not even any flu.</p>
<p>Really strange. My last antibody test came out negative as well.</p>

        <p>Had it. I refused to get tested but I was a “close contact” to someone positive. Got a sore throat and coughed a bit for about 4 days then felt fine. No different from a normal cold or minor flu. I know plenty of people who tested positive and dealt with it well</p>

<p>When I was feeling better I went back to work and went about business as usual. </p>

<p>A lot of these crazies act like people who are sick are running around. Like I don't need to quarantine; when I'm feeling lousy I stay at home and rest.</p>

        <p>I don't really know if I got it or not. At the start of September I got all the symptoms - it started with a really bad sore throat which then evolved to cough and feeling like crap. My fever was really low, and for some days my sense of smell was greatly diminished. </p>
<p>I went to get tested due to my job, and they did the nasal swab. I got a negative result, but after some research I found out that the false negative rate is considerable so I'm unsure.</p>

        <p>My husband probably had it as early as last November. We were taking a trip and he was coughing like crazy, spitting phlegm all the time and was generally sick. He said it felt different than anything else. He only recently told me he can't really taste or smell much, so there's that. Just a speculation, but could have been.</p>

        <p>Complete speculation but I got a nasty cold from visibly sick (maskless lol) Chinese tourists in December. Couldn't sit up for a day from feeling like the wind was knocked out of me and had a fever for two days. Not quite a flu but not just a cold either. For me it's totally normal to have the lite version of whatever goes around that year and to have it early. Then later in the season I see the office workers with the same thing and I always say, oh yeah I had that one already this year. Pretty much without fail. I know a nurse who said in January, "The flu is really weird this year. It's a horrible cough that's not testing positive for any influenza" but she failed to make the connection when her hospital started preparing to get overwhelmed in March, which never happened.</p>
<p>I gave it to my landlord's whole renovation crew and their families, so at least 8 people, and the oldest guy had to go to the hospital for steroids because he couldn't breathe, was down for a week... but he took horrible care of himself anyway, didn't wear a mask to work with insulation or plaster, etc.</p>
<p>I looked into the rate of cases in the tourist city I was working in and it has remained incredibly low compared to other local urban areas, which would kind of be explained if we all got it that early from direct contact with tourists.</p>

        <p>I've had a normal virus before, I can't catch something that doesn't exist though so no I haven't had "the virus" though. Getting heavily into keeping a proper detox routine and not getting any seasonal anything I'm starting to doubt the narrative of most common yearly viral transmission overall and feel more like it's just an accumulation of toxins that build up and are released from our bodies all at once causing illness. Naturally in cooler weather our noses run more and what happens if those cavities were filled with toxins that had little chance to consistently release themselves into other parts of the body before? Well there you go.</p>

<p>Just when I thought I was recovering, the VASCULAR virus made me have a nosebleed that quite literally I soaked a 5" x 5" section of a bathtowel with.</p>
<p>Add into this the blood specks I was coughing up out of my lungs and yes, this was a quite severe virus compared to the numerous flus I have had over the past 40 years.</p>

        <p>So maybe you were an unlucky one.
It's like bein on the road, am I the lucky one because I didn't have an accident or is it better to call the one in an accident the unlucky one?
It's all a matter of percentage, most people don't have a big problem with covid so the are the norm, the tiny amount of people suffering from severe effects are the outliers that are the unlucky ones.</p>
