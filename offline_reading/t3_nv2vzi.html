    <strong>Doomers, can you explain to me why we DON'T need a control group?</strong>
    <p><p>Seems like a smart, scientific move to have one but what the fuck do I know, eh? Also, if you have the fucking time to spare, could you please enlighten me as to WHY people aren't being tested for preexisting antibodies before they get vaccinated? Particuarly when natural immunity is said to last far longer than the immunity provided by the vaccine?</p>
<p>Before they changed the defintion of herd immunity (did they change it back again, I can't remember?) it was said you could achieve it through vaccination AND infection. Given that, in the UK at least, something like over 70% of adults have had their first jab now, and with how fucking easily transmissable the virus is you'd have to concede that most people have probably had the virus at this point, COMBINED with the fact that deaths and hospitilizations are at an all time fucking low, you'd figure herd immunity had been reached, right?</p>
<p>So explain to me why restrictions need to continue? Why we can't just go right the fuck back to normal right now? Places that have opened completely like Florida and Texas are doing fucking brilliantly, yet here we are dragging our fucking feet, glacially easing restrictions whilst maintaining things like masks indoors and fucking social bubbles and all that fucking shite. Not to mention every day they're threatening to push back the June 21st date, keeping the goalposts constantly in motion.</p>
<p>You know, when your life changes on a dime and all of a sudden you have to contend with fucking bullshit like this that threatens not only your livelihood but your mental and physical health, it's not a fucking crime to complain and question things. You might want to give it a try. Don't confuse your compliance and zealousness for virtue. You're like that little twat from "Recess", snitching to the teacher every time someone breaks the rules.</p>
<p>BONUS QUESTION: Why in the fuck are kids being vaccinated when they're at zero risk from the virus? You aren't willing to risk the life of an eighty six year old, someone who's lived a full life, to the virus, but you ARE willing to risk the life of a twelve year old, someone who is at no risk from the virus and has their whole life ahead of them, with an experimental vaccine which could have disastrous long term effects... and yet somehow you're convinced you're in the right and that we're all evil scumbags?</p></p>

        <p>I watched John Oliver last night. He said that COVID in the US was largely over, but COVID in the UK is still a raging pandemic.</p>
<p>Apparently, he didn't realize that the UK has anywhere from 0-5 COVID deaths a day, while the US generally has 500-600........</p>

        <p>As one of the few liberals on this sub, I thought Oliver  was okayish before COVID. Since COVID, he's been boring.</p>
<p>But he's one of those people whose shows I sometimes inexplicably watch even though I find him boring.</p>
<p>I watched the beginning, where he talked about how COVID was still out of control in Britain, all because of Boris Johnson's  Sweden-like approach during March and early April 2020. (Which of course Johnson completely abandoned after about 6 weeks and went to having the strictest lockdowns in Europe, but that hardly seems to matter to UK Liberals.)</p>
<p>Then, he talked about how COVID was out of control in Brazil because of Bolsanaro's open policies. Ignoring the fact that things are far worse in Peru, which has the strictest lockdowns in the world. And also ignoring the fact that, since Brazil has closed its schools longer than any other country in the world, Brazil can't be that open.</p>
<p>When I realized that Oliver was going to spend the rest of the show talking about the supposed rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during COVID, I turned the TV off.</p>

        <p>It's more of a religion or a cult, and as you probably know, faith needs no testing. I'd imagine that's why they see no issues with not having a control group. And yeah... I kinda have to say it... You're asking in a wrong sub. We know better here.</p>

<p>It's not just that. Those who had a prior infection were <em>excluded</em> from the trials. We have long lasting immunity - better than the vaccine - and they still want to give us a vaccine that they didn't even test on us. What the fuck is going on.</p>

        <p>The Swiss covid pass bullshit claims that in order to be considered someone that recovered from the virus, you need to have been infected during the phase when they were testing people, and that they will only consider you a recovered patient if you had a positive test.
Oh and they still push for vaccinating recovered patients because it’s claimed that natural immunity only lasts 180 days.</p>

        <p>Just to re-iterate some of the points here with sources:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210428/Recovered-COVID-19-patients-show-signs-of-long-term-immunity.aspx">Recovered patients show long-term immunity.</a></p>
<p>“Thus, recovered COVID-19 patients are likely to better defend against the variants than persons who have not been infected but have been immunized with spike-containing vaccines only,” writes Cohen and colleagues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210312/Natural-virus-induced-immunity-protective-against-UK-and-South-African-SARS-CoV-2-variants-in-hamster-study.aspx">Protection against variants in recovered infections.</a></p>
<p>"These findings indicate that prior infection with an earlier strain of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the UK is protective against clinical disease caused by the same strain or two VOCs now in circulation."</p>
<p>Also, 4000 variants in the UK as of December last year. It's likely to be much higher than that now - yet we still have "variants of concerns" - it's quite amazing they are able to identify and sort through all these different variants to ascertain what is and isn't concerning.</p>
<p>Brave little wizards at SAGE. Oh wait, they aren't virologists. LOL</p>

        <p>Man, you got to clean up the language and post this on a pro vaccines sub. I have the exact same questions and I can't seem to find any answers that are legitimate. I don't know if you're going to get a good answer from this sub, you just going to get support. But I would love to see what pro-vaxxers would say to this.
(I only say clean up the language because you might not be taken as seriously if you got a bunch of "fucks" in there, lol)</p>
