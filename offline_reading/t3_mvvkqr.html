    <strong>Something to consider for everyone avoiding the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that the spike protein itself is toxic, not only does it have potential for prion disease, but also general neurotoxicity: </p>
<p><a href="https://carterheavyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf">https://carterheavyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf</a></p>

<p>If you haven't been vaccinated but spend any time around those that have, you will be exposed to high amounts of this spike protein. It is not a coincidence that many women spending time around vaccinated women are also having period issues. </p>
<p>It is also not a coincidence that many people are becoming ill and developing covid symptoms after being vaccinated because what so many fail to realize is that <strong>many of the symptoms of covid are not due to the virus in it's totality, but due to the spike protein itself. Therefore, it would follow that reprogramming all cells in the body to generate this spike protein continually would lead to higher rates of disease, not just for those vaccinated, but to those spending time around them as well.</strong> </p>
<p>I speak from personal experience, my girlfriend that I live with got her first moderna shot a few weeks ago. Despite working in retail since last september, she never got symptomatic covid until after she got her shot. She got a full body rash 7 days from the shot, and 3 days after that was "the sickest i've been in 7 years". A few days after the worst of her sickness (high fever and cough) she developed a major rash at the injection site that wasn't there previously. </p>
<p>I never get sick, never get the flu, and never have worse than a cough or sore throat. But since she got vaccinated and then developed all the symptoms of covid, I have had a fever myself the past few days that won't seem to break. </p>
<p>I know I've had covid before because I was slightly ill and feeling down with a cough and sore throat last fall. </p>
<p>I think one of the biggest lies is that covid immunity wanes. <strong>It doesn't, but if the spike protein itself is being continually manufactured and attacking the body of the vaccinated person and the people living with/around them, we will see increases in "covid" as a result of this.</strong></p>
<p>It seems quite an ironic twist of fate. The doomers treat all of us that just want life to continue as it was before as walking biological bombs, just for they themselves to get "vaccinated" and become walking biological bombs themselves!</p></p>

        <p>the whole "people only lived til 40 before modern times" is one of the biggest misconceptions ever. the average life expectancy was so low because it was really common for babies and young children to die. if you made it to a certain age you were pretty likely to live a full life.</p>

        <p>Yeah, a lot of the side effects that people are reporting match up with what the spike protein did when it was part of the virus.  It's interacting with the same tissues and likely can cause the same complications.  It's an asshole.  It's not like the traditional vaccines where they were dead or crippled to the point where they couldn't really reproduce in you and just hung around like punching bags for your immune system to train against.  These spikes are active agents.</p>
<p>I'm still skeptical about them being able to escape the body of a vaccinated person, though.  They would probably be pretty fragile on their own.</p>
<p>I remember once reading about a proposed category below virus... like something that doesn't even have enough DNA/RNA to be classed as a proper virus, but could still cause issues.  Imagine a world where we created it with this shot if it can escape, though.</p>

        <p>Well, I  heard for years about women syncing up their periods, so that symptom at least could be a sympathetic pain.  One woman's cycle goes off so probably pheromones we don't consciously recognize but are picked up by our bodies tell the other women's bodies it's a stressful time, maybe you should bleed like a stuck pig or stop menstruating for a bit.  </p>
<p>I'm open to the possibility that the spikes get into the lung cells (hence the symptom of coughing... it takes two weeks to get the antibodies going to fight them, so yeah, the vaccinated are producing spikes for potentially weeks.  The spikes like to attach to lung cells.  I'm not sure if they would be able to produce more of themselves after attaching, but maybe nature found a way.  Like Jurassic Park and they are a microvirus now.  Maybe they just get coughed out and dislodge?</p>
<p>They also like to attack cells in our digestive track and reproductive systems.  That's where all the ACE2 cells are... and also the brain.  They have no way out from the brain, but all the shitting and puking is them trying to get another out.</p>

        <p>It's important to consider other possibilities, even if they seem unlikely. Challenging ones ideas is what sets us apart from people who are dogmatic.  I think it's a topic of interest to keep an eye out on. </p>
<p>Well, the spikes are supposed to bind with ACE2, but I don't think all types of cells in our body have it or in high enough doses to be a good host.  That's why lung, gastro, brain and reproductive cells are its favorite.  Especially lung to start with, hence it being a respiratory virus with an easy means of escape (having people cough it back out.</p>
<p>I don't know how hard the data is, but I think the CDC just suggested it takes like two weeks for the immune cells the virus creates to mature, hence waiting the two weeks after the vaccine.  That is why they say you can get sick within a few days of getting the shot to up to two weeks.  They will even admit that part... so how much anarchy are these wild spike proteins causing in the meantime?  If they were a flash in the pan of a few hours it would be like norovirus, which passes so quickly through the body we can't mount an immune response and will never be able to fight it off before it gives us the pukes.</p>
<p>No, the mRNA must hang around for days or weeks itself, until it's beaten by the antibodies it caused to be created.  The spikes could very well be able to make more spikes.</p>

<p>Also the lining of the blood vessels, which is probably why we are seeing higher rates of blood clotting and strokes related to these "vaccines". </p>
<p>&rt;  so how much anarchy are these wild spike proteins causing in the meantime? </p>
<p>It probably depends upon the individuals immune system. Which is why some have immediate reactions like strokes and seizures, while others are developing fucking herpes infections well past the 2 week mark. </p>
<p>&rt; No, the mRNA must hang around for days or weeks itself </p>
<p>That's not how it works. There is a reason the vials have to be kept so cold or else they go bad quickly. The mrna itself breaks down very quickly. </p>
<p>The question is how long are the spike proteins continually created, and how toxic are they?</p>

        <p>Hmm, well yeah, the initial mRNA is supposed to fade, that just furthers the concern that the spike proteins must be able to infect other cells to keep going.  They were how covid attached to do that afterall.   I guess the mRNA might be transcribing itself to hang around longer in the body, but it seems like a handful of random spikes produced by just the shot mRNA wouldn't last long enough on their own to pump up the immune response.</p>

        <p>I agree. It seems like in theory the spike creation should end with the mrna exiting the body, but theory and real world results can be very different...</p>

        <p>The mrna hangs around only for a few hours before degrading. Once they are gone there is no physical way for your body to produce more spoke proteins. The spikes proteins do not magically reproduce from that point.</p>

        <p>Well, I am a woman and lived with two other roommates and we all started out with different cycles. Within a few months we all ended up with the exact same cycle, to the exact day. It’s not a myth. It’s real. It’s been known thru out history. Happened prior to that in a college dorm suite situation with six of us together.</p>
<p>Periods are not talked about generally except amongst women so this syncing comes at a surprise to a lot of men.</p>

<p>No one is denying periods sync up with others that you live with. It's common knowledge as far as I am aware. </p>
<p>The issue is irregular periods all happening at the same time among those that normally aren't in sync, such as those in the workplace, or people randomly meeting at parties or restaurants and then all getting irregular periods soon after.</p>

        <p>Syncing would be periods over time aligning with one another.</p>
<p>We are seeing menopausal women bleeding.</p>
<p>Women on birth control bleeding.</p>
<p>Women getting heavy flow/spotting that is very unusual.</p>
<p>The obvious conclusion is that something is affecting reproductive health.</p>
<p>&rt;Here is an explanation:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;" Under normal circumstances this is very rare, and when this happens it is called a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=decidual+cast&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web&amp;iai=r1-1&amp;page=1&amp;sexp=%7B%22recipedexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D">decidual cast. </a>These are extremely rare, but when they do happen it is usually when pregnancies go wrong, or after abortions, or when women take any of the pregnancy hormones at too high an amount and then suddenly stop taking them. The entire uterine wall gets expelled and it comes out in one piece that looks like a uterus. It is rare, this seldom happens even due to the causes mentioned here, it takes a serious hormonally traumatic event to trigger a decidual cast. Under normal circumstances, they don't lead to infertility.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>But what if the woman had no pregnancy go wrong, took no hormones, had EVERYTHING normal, and then this happens? Well, it does not happen. Yet after the corona vax it is happening.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Let me explain something here -<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Even when a woman is not pregnant, she still has pregnancy hormones in her at a constant level. When she gets pregnant, they increase to help maintain the pregnancy but even without a pregnancy, she still has them. <strong>If the corona vax is triggering decidual casts, it means that normal non-pregnant hormonal levels are spiked downward so much the body believes a traumatic pregnancy event happened and it expels the entire uterine wall.</strong> <strong><em>My guess (and I am more than right, I am damn right and it's really no guess at all) - my FACTUAL supposition that goes beyond theory is that if you take a woman who's not pregnant and down spike her hormones so bad that this happens she's no longer fertile, and probably never will be again.</em></strong> "</p>
<p>I don't want to link the website I found that explanation from on reddit since it's super conspiratorial and I don't agree with a lot of other stuff on it. However, from a biological perspective this makes sense to me. If you're interested in the source you can google the quote above.</p>

        <p>Yup, I’ve always known it’s a myth. I went to an all girls high school. No ones periods truly synced up. Whenever they did coincidentally, it would be maybe 2 girls that actually started on different days but because they bonded over the pain and symptoms in that brief moment, they remembered the time they synced up far more than the many many many times they didn’t sync up at all. And that was in my friend group. Now imagine an entire high school of girls... all syncing up. It would be obvious evidence but it simply didn’t happen. And all the teachers were women as well (catholic school so it was kinda the standard plus all the nuns didn’t want us looking at male teachers and getting distracted lol wtf) I mean... come on. If syncing happened, it would 100% happen at a girls high school. Where some girls didn’t freaking shower or use deodorant yet, so if you wanna go the pheromone route, there’s some evidence too, since some teenagers just don’t have good hygiene habits yet. Proof after proof, people still don’t believe it because they’ll say ‘me and my girlfriends have been synced up for yearrrrss’ except they haven’t. It just isn’t a thing. Doesn’t exist. Never has.</p>

You keep coming back at people who are successfully refuting the Alex Jones level misinformation you’re posting and I don’t see a single scientific reference that points to a case study or other evidence, NOT ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE BUT ACTUAL FACTS, that any of this is happening.

        <p>These crippled viruses you’re talking about have intact proteins on their surface, they just can’t reproduce anymore. They need these intact proteins to induce an immune reaction, enabling the body to fight off real virions with those exact surface proteins in the future. mRNA vaccines lead to the production of intact proteins, but cut out all the other stuff a virus is made of that isnt really needed to induce an immune reaction. How exactly can the mRNA be worse than an inactivated or dead whole virus, as it literally leads to a less diverse collection of virus components in the body?</p>

        <p>Gladly.  The spike protein that is being used in the vaccines, or the protein that the vaccine is re-wiring your DNA to produce was made off the very first “sequence” of COVID-19.  Anybody who actually reads into any articles claiming to have sequenced SARSNcov2 will see that they based the entire narrative of the Covid world off of a partial sequence of about 20-40 dna strands not 150-200 (sorry if my numbers are off I’m not a scientist lol I just do my research).  So right off the bat people were making tons of assumptions based off partial evidence and to this point there has never been a full sequence of Covid-19, and therefore still no proof that Covid exists.  </p>
<p>Back to the spike protein, they based this vaccine off of the first sequence.  This technology rewires your body to ONLY produce antibodies for this specific spike protein and nothing else ever.  Not only that,  this GMO spike protein overrides your bodies natural immune responses to literally everything else ever, so by taking this “vaccine” you are essentially, in broader terms, giving yourself medically induced AIDS.  You are destroying your bodies ability to react and respond to EVERY OTHER POSSIBLE ILLNESS except the very first partial sequencing of Covid-19.  </p>
<p>Not only this, but due to vaccine shedding, this effect appears to make these extremely toxic gmo proteins contagious.  Women are reporting having irregular periods while being just in close contact with the Vaxxed.  This shit is so fucked up and so toxic to people it’s unbelievable.</p>

        <p>Hmmm why would they choose this protein as the target for the vaccine? Is it possibly because it's the only way for the virus to get into our cells? If this sequence mutated, then wouldn't the mutated covid no longer be able to infect us? </p>

<p>The mRNA vaccine doesn't "re-wire" anything. It's mRNA. It doesn't integrate into your genome. The transcription machinery in your cells only transcribes DNA to mRNA, not the other way around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mRNA vaccine doesn't <em>need</em> the whole viral genome. It only needs the codons for spike proteins, which is all your immune system needs to develop antibodies.</p>

<p>Introducing your immune system to a new antigen doesn't "re-write" anything. It just adds something new to its repertoire.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this.  </p>
<p>I've been coming to the same conclusion on my own.  </p>
<p>Not everyone I know that has covid becomes very sick.  But some do.  Not everyone I know that got vaccinated became ill from the shot.  But some do.  And it seems to be about the same proportion.  So I've been thinking that some people tolerate the spike protein well and others have extreme immune reactions.</p>

        <p>&rt; So I've been thinking that some people tolerate the spike protein well and others have extreme immune reactions. </p>
<p>It could be that some people can tolerate it well for a while...then develop cancer or auto immune disease down the road. </p>
<p>Or others will have immediate issues like strokes/blood clots, etc. </p>
<p>If the spike protein itself is as toxic as I believe it is, and has the potential to create problems almost anywhere in the body, it is important to avoid people that are shedding this. </p>
<p>Which based on current vaccination rates, is close to half the country (US). </p>
<p>What's most concerning to me is the hidden danger of sustained high exposure to the spike protein, for those vaccinated or not. </p>
<p>We know covid is a mild disease for most people, but what if you were in a permanent state of mild disease...forever? How will the human body handle that over the months and years to come?</p>
<p>And again...this is a threat to EVERYONE.</p>

<p>Because they are shedding them. These "vaccines" program the body to continually create them, thus making it possible for the spikes to be expelled out of the breath, pores, feces, etc.</p>

        <p>No they aren’t. </p>
<p>Your body takes in the mRNA and it is then used to create the spike protein. The spike protein is then released with no function. As it is recognised as a foreign agent your body produces antibodies matching the protein coat of the spike protein. </p>
<p>After this happens your body breaks down the mRNA and the spike protein so there is neither instruction to make them nor any remaining spike proteins. The only thing that is left is the spike protein specific antibody. </p>
<p>Your body is not continuously producing the spike protein it’s a short lived interaction this is why you get a second dose of most of the mRNA based ones as your body after two exposures produces a larger lasting antibody response.</p>

        <p>I'm not worried about the level of exposure if those vaccinated shed the spike protein. But this technology is still so untested that they may be shedding the mRNA instructions to make the spike protein or the viral vector vaccines may spread to us as well.</p>
<p>It's going to be a fun year.  Hopefully 2-3% encephalopathy and 5% cancer is all we see from these experiments.</p>

<p>I wasn't at first either, but my personal experience with my girlfriend getting the shot, then shedding hard and then me getting symptoms that I've never had from any cold/flu/covid in my life...it's too coincidental. </p>
<p>And long term exposure to continual bombardment of such toxins cannot be healthy. </p>
<p>&rt; they may be shedding the mRNA instructions to make the spike protein or the viral vector vaccines may spread to us as well. </p>
<p>This is seriously worrisome and I hope you're wrong. But definitely possible since we have no idea what this technology can do. </p>
<p>We also don't really know whats specifically in each shot. What if there are other instructions embedded within the advertised code to create other pathogenic proteins?</p>

        <p>You are forgetting that the actual COVID-19 virus contains those spike proteins, and people who aren’t vaccinated are very likely to get the actual virus.  Then they are definitely contagious and shedding virus just by breathing. That is the scary part, not the vaccine. Check out some of the long term side effects of the virus.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing this. This is extremely important info.</p>
<p>So you’re saying Covid-like symptoms could be from the spike protein transmitted from a vaxxed person? That a vaxxed person is not actually Covid positive but just shedding spike proteins? I thought spike proteins were on cells. How would they be transmitted then...touching, kissing, sex....but not via air, right? So not a respiratory transmission?</p>
<p>Do you know if the spike protein on our cells caused by the mRNA vaccines are permanent or being permanently created? Are the antibodies created to attack these spike proteins successful at eliminating all of them? I can’t find the answer to this question anywhere.</p>

<p>Correct. </p>
<p>&rt; That a vaxxed person is not actually Covid positive but just shedding spike proteins? </p>
<p>Well "covid positive" is sort of irrelevant given how arbitrary PCR tests are. But technically yes, they could test negative but still be spreading spikes. </p>
<p>&rt; I thought spike proteins were on cells. </p>
<p>They are supposed to be resting on the surface of cells yes. </p>
<p>&rt; How would they be transmitted then...touching, kissing, sex....but not via air, right? So not a respiratory transmission? </p>
<p>We don't know exactly. It would make sense physical contact would spread it, but if spikes are also resting on the surface of cells in lung tissue then people could be exhaling them too. </p>
<p>&rt; Do you know if the spike protein on our cells caused by the mRNA vaccines are permanent or being permanently created?  </p>
<p>This is the million dollar question. I have tried finding this information and cannot find a conclusive answer.</p>
<p>My guess is that for vaccines that require two doses, the first dose only creates temporary effects or it is only permanent in some cells in the body. The second dose (im guessing) serves to solidify the permanence/length of time. </p>
<p>&rt; Are the antibodies created to attack these spike proteins successful at eliminating all of them </p>
<p>Well...no. Isn't that the whole point? Otherwise we could just use vaccines that contain the spike protein itself instead of mrna to reprogram cells to <strong>continually</strong> create spikes.</p>

<p>Well the tests are worthless anyways. But it's way too coincidental that she develops a full body rash 6-7 days from the injection, gets symptomatic covid (sickest in 7 years) and then AFTER the worst of her symptoms she develops a rash at the injection site specifically.</p>
<p>It seems intuitively obvious to me that the post covid rash at the injection site is the body attempting to purge itself of what it was injected with.</p>
<p>As I said, a lot of the literature we are seeing now is showing that much of the symptoms of covid are specifically associated with the spike protein itself. So turning your body into a 24/7 protein creating machine is sort of like giving yourself permanent covid....</p>
<p>&rt; Can you explain your last statement? I don’t get what you mean. </p>
<p>I mean that the idea isn't to eliminate all of the spike protein. It's to keep it there.</p>

<p>And this is the key problem of this thread: you don't even know the bare basics of immunology and also don't know how to pick up a text book. There is no "million dollar question" because this is taught in entry-level college classes. And yet you feel entitled not only to an opinion but also to argue on the validity of scientific research. You're clearly both way out of your league here. So please, trust the experts and don't overestimate your own knowledge. Dunning Kruger is a bitch.</p>

        <p>The spike protein is what the mrna vaccines are making people's bodies create. It's a protein that is part of sars-cov-2 that is ostensibly useful to help train the body to create antibodies to it, thus giving better immune response to the natural sars-cov-2 (covid19) infection.</p>
<p>The problem is that it appears these spikes themselves are toxic, and are responsible for much of the symptoms associated with the viral infection itself. </p>
<p>We aren't sure how they travel out of the body but there are plausible biological methods which they might. Anecdotal evidence is pointing strongly towards this happening.</p>

        <p>It's evidence in so much as that you don't derive unfounded information from it.

        <p>The spikes are not any more toxic than any other foreign protein in your blood stream. Your immune system attacks any foreign invaders with a strong response, and it is that response that causes the vaccine symptoms. When your immune system has an innate reaction, it activates your inflammatory system causing fever and other unpleasant symptoms even if what it’s attacking isn’t doing serious harm (think about an allergic reaction). The good news is, the spike proteins don’t contain any replication materials so once the mRNA in the vaccine has all been converted by your cells and your immune system has neutralized the spike proteins the only thing that’s left is an immunity to the c19.</p>

        <p>They're the little nubbins on the outside of coronaviruses (and others, but whatever). They act as keys to help the virus unlock the complex mechanical membrane that surrounds your body's cells.</p>
<p>Because they have a shape that's unique to each virus, they're really useful for identifying the virus that they're attached to - which is exactly how your immune system makes use of them! </p>
<p>The mRNA vaccine uploads the instructions (messenger RNA particles) to your muscle cells so that they can make these spike proteins, essentially plastering your body with wanted posters for COVID. That way your immune system can get an idea of what COVID looks like. These spike proteins are attached to your muscle cells and fade away over time as part of your body's regular maintenance, but the antibodies <em>for</em> those spike proteins stay in your immune system's repertoire.</p>
<p>What the blog post OP shared is suggesting is that these spike proteins can not only become detached from the cell membranes they're anchored to, but do so in sufficient numbers to not only travel to the lungs or skin secretions, be transmitted to other people, and <em>enter their bodies in sufficient numbers to cause an immune response</em>. </p>
<p>This is, to say the least, completely fucking stupid.</p>

        <p>Those protein spikes help the virus attach to our cells, we have the lock (our cell receptors), and the protein spikes are the virus' keys. Once the proteins have unlocked our receptors, they're allowed entry into the cell. Then, they take control of it and fill the cell up with it's RNA (inside the RNA lies the "code" for creating the virus). The cell ends up creating a bunch of copies of the virus, and releases them by bursting open. Those viruses continue to follow the same cycle.</p>
<p>They travel through our respiratory tract. Sometimes they'll stay up high near our throat, so our symptoms are just a sore throat, but sometimes they'll travel deeper into the respiratory tract causing severe symptoms (it can even reach the heart). There are more receptors (at least the ones that covid attaches to) deeper in the respiratory tract, so that's one reason why it's more dangerous than the flu or the common cold. </p>

        <p>the vaccine doesn’t allow you to continually create spike proteins. Your body won’t ever have the DNA to make the protein. The vaccine gives a dose of <strong>mRNA</strong> - which tells your body to make spike proteins. These spike proteins then elicit and immune response whereby your body is then primed and ready to attack the next time it sees that spike protein. </p>
<p>mRNA doesn’t last long. Once that mRNA dose from the vaccine is worn-out/destroyed, your body cannot make any more - because your body has not, and will not have, the DNA required to do so.</p>

        <p>Utter bollocks. The spike protein is a part of the virus, not the virus, it has no self replicability. The vaccine gives the immune system an insight about what to look for.</p>
<p>Symptoms after a vaccine are caused by the immune response to a foreign object in the body and actively destroys it. All that is left is the memory of the spike so that when you come in to contact with Covid your immune system responds faster, prevents replication and in the worse cases death.</p>

        <p>If getting the vaccine meant you could travel again would you get it? Anti-vaxers could never go on holiday or visit family ever again. Most people in England say “I’m nervous of the vaccine we don’t know what’s in it”. But given the opportunity to go on holiday and requiring the vaccine to travel means they drop their argument and are happy to receive it. Is this a similar feeling in the US?</p>

        <p>This is some hill-billy fear mongering shit, if I’ve ever seen. One, that paper is a low impact paper and I would be surprised if it is ever used in research let alone cited - not from a reputable journal. The other link is an opinion piece that cites literature but the science is inaccurate and the writer clearly inputs their opinion with “in my opinion...” yeah, no.</p>

        <p>Please tell me you’re messing with us dude...this is so obviously wrong. Are you a virologist? A biochemist? I seriously doubt it considering your understanding of this stuff isn’t too great. </p>
<p>The articles you cited have their own agenda and are poorly written, someone else commented on that on this post so go see that. </p>
<p>As for the spike protein, it isn’t “active” (whatever you mean by that). The spike protein is not what makes you sick, it is the what is inside the cell (the viruses genetic content) that makes you sick. The spike protein is merely the surface of the virus, and it by itself does not make you sick. This is why it is used in the vaccine. It is equivalent to taking a “dead/beaten down virus.” I would elaborate but honestly I doubt you have the mental capacity to truly understand this.</p>
<p>Overall, you’re an idiot lmao.</p>

        <p>Those are not scientifically credible sources.  I wouldn't trust anything they have to say.  In the US and Europe, two vaccines have already been put on hold (J&amp;J and AstraZeneca) due to extremely rare side effects.  If the Moderna vaccine had any side effects worth worrying about, it would be put on hold as well.</p>
<p>It sounds like your girlfriend simply got infected with COVID-19 a week before she got the shot, and then you got infected after that.  Did the two of you get tested for COVID-19 after symptoms started showing up?</p>
<p>I would not be confident that you had COVID-19 in the fall.  Those are all symptoms of other, unrelated illnesses like the flu, which is still circulating.  Did you get tested?</p>

        <p>Those are two if the worst papers I have ever read. The first one uses the word potential/potentially before every statement because he has no facts that he can state definitively. Of he did he would see "this has this affect" not "this had the potential to have this affect". And the second paper reads like a high schooler wrote. Both not even remotely close to being valid articles. I wouldn't trust this at all. No science behind any of these claims</p>

        <p>You had a sore throat  and a cough last fall. Did you take a covid test? I doubt you did and I doubt you had the rona. Most people go through hell fighting it, they’re down in bed for days. There’s no scientific backing to what you’re saying. It’s all your own experiences which hardly equates to solid proof in any scientific circle. </p>
<p>Do us all a favor and have a conversation with a doctor about your experiences and concerns. They’ll be able to answer your questions and explain all of this better than anyone on the internet. Like 8 years + of medical schooling has to count for something, right?</p>

        <p>The lack of biological insights by the OP is disturbing. I understand we should doubt and question everything, without exceptions. But by the 3rd paragraf, myself, a biomedical researcher studying b cell lymphomas (b cells produce antibodies), found it totally misleading and incorrect what you are stating.</p>

        <p>This is not even wrong. There are lots of big words, but I’m entirely sure they don’t know what that means. The reason you feel bad after the covid vaccine is because of an inflammatory response to the protein. That is the entire idea. It is the inflammatory response that leads to the lasting immunity. It has nothing to do with neurotoxicity or aluminum for God’s sake. Even if you buy the idea that a covid spike protein is somehow magically a prion, you are exposed fewer of them from a vaccine then you would from getting the dang virus. Nowhere in that idiocy that you posted is there any kind of claim that you can spread spike proteins, which is completely impossible. The vaccine works by stimulating protein production in the arm muscle, not anywhere it could possibly be spread through the air.<br>
As far as your GF getting covid after the shot, it is well known that it takes a bit of time for immunity to kick in, about 2 weeks after the 2nd shot.
Also you know you had covid? Did you get a test? So you don’t. 
So in closing, this is the dumbest thing I’ve ever read. We are all now stupider for having read it. I award you zero points and may God have mercy on your soul.</p>

<p>This simply isn't true. Like I said above, I never get sick or show any symptoms so my immune system clears any viral proteins out quickly. But what is my immune system supposed to do when sleeping and living next to my girlfriend who is spewing them out 24/7?</p>
<p>&rt; Nowhere in that idiocy that you posted is there any kind of claim that you can spread spike proteins, which is completely impossible.  </p>
<p>It's definitely not completely impossible anymore than having sex with someone can't spread disease. If the spike protein is resting on the surface of cells then physical contact would definitely qualify. It's entirely plausible that the proteins could be exhaled as well. </p>

<p>Ahhh, vaccines the leading cause of coincidences as always!</p>
<p>&rt;  Also you know you had covid? Did you get a test? So you don’t. </p>
<p>The tests generate 90%+ false positives, they aren't diagnostic. You don't know you have covid from a test. You know you have covid because you have symptoms of covid. Which is such a big part of what I'm referring to...if the spike protein itself is responsible for many of the symptoms of covid then the vaccines themselves are going to be keeping people permanently sick as long as their cells are creating spikes.</p>

        <p>Ok... against my better judgement I’m going to try to explain slowly one more time, but I really don’t have any hopes whatever. You seem to be laboring under a number of misconceptions. One of these is that after getting a vaccine one is continuously producing spike proteins. I think you are getting spike proteins and antibodies confused. The vaccine works by delivering a type of nucleic acid called mRNA into the cell. This mRNA contains instructions to produce viral spike proteins. The muscle cells in your arm make those proteins. This is called translation and takes place at the ribosome. This goes on for a few hours, then the mRNA goes away. No more spike proteins are made. The immune system, seeing the foreign protein, is then stimulated to an immune response. This immune response can make you feel pretty bad.  After this though, if your body sees a similar foreign protein, it’s primed to fight it immediately, and doesn’t allow something like a virus to get a foothold. 
As far as tests producing 90 percent false positives that is simply not true (I’m not even really sure what you mean by that). They are quite specific, false negatives are actually more of a problem. 
Also you say you know you have covid if you have the symptoms. This is nonsense. Many viruses have similar symptoms, covid often has none.</p>

        <p>This is the chemical composition of RNA it’s not stable and lasts a very short time. Love that you now want “sources”.  Basically due to the extra oxygen in the backbone of the molecule which makes it more reactive and degraded. There’s also a ton of enzymes in the cell whose job is to degrade RNA.</p>

<p>Do you have a specific source on how long the spike protein is created? Theoretically you're correct it would make sense that as the mrna degrades quickly then the spike protein creation should as well. </p>
<p>Real world empirically evident results of women having such irregular periods including post menopausal women bleeding shows that perhaps said spikes are being created for longer than what many would assume.</p>

        <p>Not entirely sure what you mean by that. I think that most people would consider me an expert. I’m licensed in 2 states, I have 2 degrees and I’ve been practicing for over a decade not counting residency and fellowship. I have been called as an expert witness in trials. The world is big and there’s a lot in it, nobody knows everything, so you have to stay humble. That being said, I know bullshit when I smell it.</p>

        <p>I find it hilarious how conservatives can’t seem to turn their heightened skepticism on themselves. What makes OP more qualified than <strong>any</strong> other commenter? Even a cursory understanding of basic immunology &amp; biology would correct OP’s assumptions. But apparently no one here has ever cracked open a Janeway or Kuby to learn the basics. </p>
<p>Cons get angry when liberals call them stupid, then turn around and repeat stupid nonsensical shit like this post. Its stuff like this as to why your party is being abandoned.</p>

        <p>In emergency medicine and medical toxicology, but all physicians have training in basic biology prior to medical school and extensive training of specifically human biology during, and we’re not even to 2nd year I&amp;I yet, I’ll tell ya if I’m outside my comfort zone, and better yet, I don’t make insane statements that are! Novel concept yes? You don’t need an immunologist for this, what you really need is a 9th grade biology book and to read some Carl Sagan.</p>
