    <strong>PROOF the media LIES in regards to COVID deaths!</strong>

<p><strong>Headline:</strong></p>
<p>Super-fit bodybuilder and MMA fighter, 32, killed ‘by Covid’ in his sleep</p>
<p><strong>Main takeaways:</strong></p>
<p>A coroner told Christopher that Ian’s death is being considered Covid-related, <em>although they have refused to perform another coronavirus test to save money.</em> (His first test came back inconclusive.)</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>So basically, he didn't die of COVID then. The propaganda machine is strong guys, read beyond the headlines!</p></p>

        <p>"His Covid test came back inconclusive, but an x-ray saw Ian diagnosed with pneumonia – a common side affect for people suffering from serious coronavirus infections."</p>
<p>Because of this, this right here. The continued trend of assuming and blatantly labeling everything as Covid. Disingenuous piece written to try and dispell the concept "healthy young fit people" have nothing to worry about. He wasn't feeling well and decided the best option was to chug all the dayquil and NyQuil he had? Doesn't sound like somebody who understands health and recovery that much. Unfortunately, a lot of MMA and fitness people will engage with other substances that can be detrimental to their health on a person to person basis for short term benefits. Appearances can be deceiving. Not saying this is the direct culprit, but to rule anything else out and immediately blame Covid comes across as blatant disingenuousness and agenda driven.</p>

        <p>Pneumonia has existed for hundreds of years if not longer.  It's probably been around for as long as creatures have had lungs.  That's millions of years.  Covid has been around for 1 year.  </p>
<p>Pneumonia does not equal covid.</p>
