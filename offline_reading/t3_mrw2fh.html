        <p>They’re probably just going to inject the kids with saline and use it as proof that the vaccine is safe for children. The kids also won’t get covid, ya know since kids don’t really get covid, and they’ll use that as proof that the vaccine is effective.</p>

        <p>I have small children myself, school age and toddler. I’ve spent considerable time considering the risks/benefits of covid infection and vaccination in kids. Full disclosure, to say that I’m a layman is putting it mildly. I’m a mechanic, I went to community college. I am not a complete idiot,  but I’m not far from it. I am however, a Dad, and there is nothing I wouldn’t do to keep my children safe. My kids have all been vaccinated with the normal regimen of childhood vaccines, I am not an anti-vaxxer. I believe that the standard immunizations most everyone gets as kids have been instrumental in saving the lives of children that would otherwise have been lost to preventable diseases. If in fact covid was as serious to kids as diseases like Diphtheria, MMR, polio, ect I would not hesitate to get vaccinated myself if it meant I could protect them. </p>
<p>But all available data currently seems to indicate that covid causes mild illness in the vast majority of children that contract it. I strikes me as extremely irresponsible and downright unethical to subject your children to a vaccine (for which we have no long term safety information) to ostensibly protect them from a virus that has a very low risk of causing them serious illness. </p>
<p>I understand that this is a novel virus, and that there have been many people that have contracted it and developed severe illness and/or died, even with no known risk factors or comorbidities. I know that the immune system is complex, multifaceted, and it’s nuances are beyond my understanding. However, it seems to me that children are exposed to a great many viruses that are in fact novel (to them) throughout childhood. I’m aware that there are antibodies passed from the mother after birth, but as they grow, and especially as they enter school/daycare and begin interacting with other kids from outside of their own homes, they frequently contact all sorts of viral illnesses, subsequently recover, and then have immunity to that particular virus for some length of time. I guess my question is this; how is SARS CoV2 any different or unique from the plethora of other respiratory viruses that kids encounter, and why on earth would you inject them with a vaccine with so many unknowns? Sorry this ran so long, it’s a complicated subject.</p>
<p>tl;dr what kind of person would have their otherwise healthy children injected with an experimental vaccine against a virus which is unlikely to cause serious illness?</p>

        <p>I 100% agree with you. The people are offering up their children as sacrificial lambs to the proverbial slaughter. I believe the vaccines I received as a kid were created with the intent of helping mankind. I believe the recent vaccines created are nothing more than a cash grab.</p>

        <p>Which is exactly what is occurring. When I was in the military I was forced to get the flu vaccine every year. Every year I was in I got sick with the flu. When I’d question the efficacy of the vaccine I was told “you were sick with flu before you got the vaccine, it just hadn’t presented with symptoms yet. If you hadn’t gotten the flu vaccine your symptoms would’ve been worse.” Like they can possibly quantify that. I have been out of the military for 4 years and haven’t had the flu vaccine since. I also have not had the flu since my last year in the military, despite owning a personal training company and basically having people breathing directly on me for hours every day. They have too many excuses for why the vaccine works, but it just didn’t work for you. The strain is different, you were already sick, you would’ve been worse without the vaccine... the reality is that it doesn’t work and we’ve been scammed by the government and big pharma. We have evidence that the old school vaccines work. We don’t see polio anymore, we don’t really see measles, mumps, and rubella anymore, those point to the historical success of vaccines, but questioning the fu vaccine or covid vaccine makes you a science denier, despite the abundant lack of evidence for efficacy.</p>

        <p>That is straight up child abuse. They have to be getting paid for this to let your child become a lab rat. Trouble is the child doesn't have a say. The child will have a say if they want to change gender though.</p>

        <p>I Know it's harsh to say this, but I really think the elite has the right way of going about this depopulation agenda. Like it seems like the way they do it only eliminates the dumbest people, so I guess that is a good thing. I have really hard time feeling bad for these people, since it's basically natural selection which is taking them out. Like if you are dumb enough to trust your government and the billionaires who look at you like garbage, I guess you deserve to be taken out of the gene pool with all of your children.</p>

        <p>That's how I see it. Like it was already talked about in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report_from_Iron_Mountain">the Report from Iron Mountain</a>, which is a fake documents according to the PC opinion, but never the less, they were already talking about this in 1967 regarding how the people joining the army are the idiocracy and if not war, than how are we going to get rid off them. </p>
<p>Like the documents is basically just about discussion how the effects of war could be replaced if the world sifts into a long term peace situation. In that documents all this war against the environment and stuff, were already suggested as a solution.</p>

        <p>Hell no, they are no way ready to start giving it to children. Everyday they are learning new things about the vaccines, new side effects. They can't even figure out the correct timing between the two shots, how much is actually required, they are talking about halving the dose of AstraZeneca....there is so much they don't even know yet. Keep them away from children. There is absolutely no reason they need it, the survival rate for children is near 100% the potential side effects of the vaccine outweigh any benefit from giving it to them</p>

        <p>I’ve seen other moms bragging about this too, and I cannot wrap my head around how people think this is some sort of exciting experience. </p>
<p>Forcing your young children to face needles that they are likely afraid of for something that isn’t even necessary and has unknown side effects? Wow, stellar parenting right there. </p>
