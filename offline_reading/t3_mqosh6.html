    <strong>Top epidemiologist - COVID mortality rate is 0.15 % worldwide</strong>
    <p><p>John PA Ioannidis of U. Standford, considered the greatest epidemiologist in the world, published on 3/26/2021, in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation an updated review of the estimated COVID-19 global mortality rate, based on serological tests (and not in PCR tests - highly fallible): 0.15% - just like the seasonal flu. Here is the study : </p>

        <p>Was talking to a ER PA friend of mine, asked him why his ER is always full if the Virus ain't raging anymore, his answer.</p>
<p>The problem has been all along that they unlike the past flu seasons, when we have to admit someone with  "Covid" now the CDC requires they are single occupancy, where we could put 2-4 people in a room with the flu, that room now is 1, of course were suffering backflow and shortage, because were using ER to house Covid due to the normal room filling up so fast, had we had to do this with the seasonal Flu all along would have always been the same way.</p>
<p>Explains why nurses have more time to practice dance moves, where they would normally have 30 - 40 patients per ward, they now have 10 - 20 hence the shorter hours.</p>
<p>I stopped accepting it was anymore then then a harsh mutation of the seasonal flu, and a political uptic in how to handle it.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs not accurate, we double patients with COVID all the time. The patients that are in single occupancy room are basically first come first serve. Our single occupancy rooms are few and far between and once they‚Äôre full, COVID patients go to semi private rooms just like everyone else.</p>

        <p>I'm just parroting what he told me, Perhaps Florida is different ?</p>
<p>I mean they are literally treating patients in the Lobby waiting area.</p>
<p>I know the Hospital he works at the ER is always packed now, and when we moved here it was ALWAYS empty. So I had to ask why the change, now this was 6-7 months ago but that ER is always the same way.</p>

        <p>Seems like he‚Äôs just wrong, then again I don‚Äôt know shit. There really was more people hospitalized than normal, Covid is much more deadly than the flu. What I never thought about until this year is how many people probably get the flu and never even know it. We know hella people get Covid and never know it, I‚Äôm sure way more get the flu and don‚Äôt know. I bet the reason hospitals were ‚Äúfull‚Äù was because Covid really is a deadly disease, for people who are old, deathly ill, or morbidly obese.</p>

        <p>How many people get the Flu, know its the Flu and just go to work, thinking nothing of it, never going to any sorta hospital until it progresses to a point they have to.</p>
<p>Nothing to say for the Media generated panic, all Doctors and nurses well know stress will make even common cold much much worse.</p>
<p>My Grandmother Died with the Flu, she had emphysema, was obese, caught the flu and wham it was too much. Sorry I don't see much of a difference accept how they list it, then it was Emphysema with flu, now everything is being marked "Covid as cause of death with Underlying conditions" When that gets adjusted I'm sure we will have a very different outlook.</p>
<p>I will say as I have said all along. It's not that I doubt its there, we just need our Science with far less political motivation.</p>

        <p>I agree with you there. There are so many patients admitted simply because they tested positive. They aren‚Äôt on oxygen and don‚Äôt require any kind of additional treatment. You don‚Äôt see that with the flu. With the flu, people come in when they have to. With COVID, people come in because they were told they were positive. It‚Äôs ridiculous that they‚Äôre even being seen, honestly. They should be told to watch themselves at home just like everyone else with a non-critical illness.</p>

        <p>What in the hell did I just read? At least you started off by prefacing that you don‚Äôt know shit. So all those TikTok video participants had the time to do those on their breaks? ‚Äúhow many people probably get the flu and never even know it.‚Äù That statement is based on the fallacy that asymptomatic is a thing, it‚Äôs not. They took the word healthy and turned it into asymptomatic. There hasn‚Äôt in the history of the flu someone who had the flu and wasn‚Äôt on their ass for days clinically presenting THE FLU.</p>

        <p>People are forced to stay at home. Being stuck at home means less workers. Less workers mean less staffing capacity. Less capacity, you are now, technically, an overwhelmed hospital.</p>

        <p>I think it‚Äôs a lot closer. What‚Äôs been interesting particularly the last month, is the amount of evidence that couldn‚Äôt possibly be denied by anybody. You‚Äôre going to see the death tolls slashed (i think the uk will lead the way with this). Bit by bit, it‚Äôs all going to come out.</p>

        <p>I think you may be right Figogoat93. I'm over in Europe, and definitely seeing more articles bashing the disproportionate measures or at least considering other options. These articles are sometimes sitting right next to others still driving the fearmongering. Quite interesting to see.</p>
<p>Top local article (most liked) from this week  by far is an article about a big city mayor calling restaurants and bars to open despite the lockdowns! Isn't that something?</p>

        <p>I know around 20 people that had COVID, they all merely lost their sense of smell and taste for 1 week, and then it was fine again. There was just two people that got a bit of a fever and muscle aches for 2 days, but that was it.</p>
<p>I always laugh when people on Reddit claim that their entire families have died from COVID or that they have been digging mass graves for their dead friends.</p>

        <p>Shocker. Ever since the dumbass models last year I have never heard 3-4% again. That was clearly bullshit. Worst I have heard is slightly over 1% (and that is in a subset of the population). Overall population rate is admitted by the dimwits at CDC to be around 0.5% (based on cases from PCR) so why the lockdowns and idiotic policies. I'm glad gems like Ioannidis are going to get quality stuff like this into science journals, this will make it harder for them to justify their bullshit in the future. </p>
<p>It also depends a lot on location apparently... Even China says Wuhan has a 4.9% death rate with COVID, while other places in China have closer to 0.15%... Hard to trust them but why make up that discrepancy? And then previously the WHO even said the death rate (and BTW, this is 'with' COVID not from it) for under 65 population is around 0.09%. People really need to get their heads out of their asses and demand the end of restrictions.</p>

        <p>Bears out. In Northern Ireland c.a.0.11% of the population died of covid in 2020 [28 days after a positive test for any reason]. In England, particularly hard hit, a whole c.a.0.13% of the population died of covid in 2020 [28 days after a positive test for any reason].</p>
<p>In early 2020 it was seen as between 0.26% (By Ioannidis) and 0.34% in the US and Italy respectively.</p>

        <p>We've all been conned. The media and the fame-hungry "scientists" who haven't been in a lab in more than 30 years convinced everyone that we are in a grave danger. Quickly they've started to fake the numbers and bully the doctors into servitude. You died with COVID = You died from COVID.</p>
<p>We have a duty to preserve as much information as we can about this insanity. The historians must know the truth, they used Flu and panic to spike the numbers up to make unimaginable amount of money.</p>

        <p>CDC reports in the 2019-2020 flu season, there were an estimated 38 million cases of influenza and estimated 22,000 deaths. That is .058% mortality rate.</p>
<p>You are saying .15%=.058%, which I hope you can see is false and is nearly 3 times as high.</p>

        <p>This is true. It‚Äôs worse than the seasonal flu, but around the same as a pandemic flu, probably actually less than a pandemic flu like 1968 or 1957.</p>
<p>It certainly does not justify the medieval measures.</p>

        <p>Didn't say it did merit that response. I said the op is lying by saying it is the same as seasonal flu.</p>
<p>But to your point,  1968 flu killed roughly 100k Americans and 1957 killed roughly 116k. Covid has killed over 5x more than both. May be less deadly once infected, but obviously spreads much more easily, even with the medical measures taken.</p>

        <p>I never said you did, I even upvoted you, I agree.</p>
<p>The population was much different in 1968 and 1957 to what it is now. Much older and more dense, and also fatter. I would expect either of those viruses to have caused a similar amount of damage in this day and age.</p>
<p>Covid might spread more than the flu, but I‚Äôm fairly certain that the flu spreads quicker, with the lower incubation time.</p>

<p>Again, I'm not sure what you understand what this study is showing. It's not saying the chances you have of dying are .15%, no matter what. It is taking data from the population as a whole and saying, of ALL the people who got the virus, .15% died. Do you understand the article?</p>

<p>Yes. So therefore Sarahs chance of dying is less than .15% because elderly are the main age group dying. </p>
<p>The death rate for a young, healthy person is so incredibly miniscule. Lower than the flu death rate</p>
