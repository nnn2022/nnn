    <strong>Sad reality</strong>
    <p><p>Posted on here before but needed somewhere to rant about this. So I’ve always been interested in government and politics and I’d consider myself more conservative and right wing thinking. I’m not religious, I would consider myself spiritual and I don’t believe politics and religion should be mixed. That’s just me! Anyways, now that i’ve explained that, my brother is 17 and I’m 19 and we have many differences in our political views. He supports the BLM organization religiously and is apart of the LBGTQ community so anything I say, he shuts down immediately. Or even my boyfriend who is conservative as well, anytime he says anything, my brother shuts him down and disrespects him. Last night, I posted on my instagram story a video of Conservative party member Michelle Rempel Garner in Calgary Alberta questioning the Libreals choices for “covid quarantine hotels” and they basically said the data to back it up is incomplete and Michelle was just questioning them for this incomplete data. He replies to it and says to look at the comments on the video and that people are saying covid is a hoax in the comments and somehow by posting the video i’m associating with those people, according to him. He’s almost 18 years old and lives in my dads basement 24/7, doesn’t have a job or his license, hasn’t worked a day in his life, my grandparents spoil him with money whenever he wants. He’s a lazy piece of shit. He then starts saying I’m going down the right wing tunnel which is filled with “misinformation” and “propaganda”. What kind of lazy 17 year old thinks they have the right to tell people where their beliefs should lie. I then point out the fact that he’s jobless and hasn’t worked for any of his money and his only reply was “So?” Personally don’t want to hear the opinion on lockdowns from someone who wasn’t actually financially affected by them. He doesn’t understand a single thing about real life or working for yourself or having your rights taken away. I ended up blocking him on instagram and he started texting me and trying to call me just to argue. Just so fucking done with this shit guys.</p></p>

        <p>Its hard when it's family.</p>
<p>I do firmly believe you HAVE to love family, barring abuse or rape, but loving "from a distance" is sometimes best at periods my sister and I have found.</p>
<p>Then when we do catch up were so busy being brother and sister we can't talk politics within the hour.</p>
<p>Love from a distance if possible, sounds you both need space.</p>

        <p>He will eventually destroy himself. It’s up to you if you care about him enough to work through with him. If he’s not willing to listen or talk with you, then I say let him be. You are your own responsibility, and he is his own. Focus on flourishing yourself.</p>

        <p>Some people live in a bubble. The biggest mistake that I made is wasting my time with people who really just do not care. If you come across people with opposing views but have no intention to talk with good faith, do not waste your time.</p>

        <p>I blame the educational system for the most part. It produces left wing drones that have no concept of reality. </p>
<p>Best thing you can do is to put a little space between you! Constantly bickering with family almost never works out.</p>
<p>FWIW, Garner is an epic politician (Poilievre is also great in this space). I saw her questioning the use of COVID hotels and nobody on the Liberal side had a clue how to defend them. The reality is that Trudeau is just making stuff up and Canadian MSM won't challenge him because they all got a hard on for him.</p>
