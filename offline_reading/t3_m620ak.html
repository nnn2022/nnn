    <strong>Can you guys just please not be nasty to retail workers? We don’t make the rules and will get fired for not following them.</strong>
    <p><p>I try to have sympathy with everyone, anti maskers included because that’s how my parents raised me. And I’m not about to let a couple dozen experiences change that philosophy but oh my lord some people who share the beliefs of this sub are so aggressive and ugly for no reason.</p>
<p>I can’t let people in without a mask because if I do then my manager has a conversation with me about why I’m not following policy. The next step is termination. I get that this is not a nice world and you guys are dealing with a lot just like everyone else, and I get that you having the beliefs that you do makes you the other in a lot of situations and that’s frustrating, but please do not scream at retail workers. Please do not spit on them or call them nazis, or idiots, or any manner of slur you can think of.</p>
<p>Your tag line is no new normal, but if the thing you’re wanting to label as normal is screaming and belittling everyone who is employed by companies whose policies you disagree with that defeats the purpose doesn’t it? </p>
<p>What I’m really trying to say is that we’re all human, and there’s no need to make death threats or throw insults in most day to day situations, but especially when the people you’re doing that to have no control over the thing you’re upset about. </p>
<p>I don’t know how many people on this sub this pertains to, but for those it does I hope you give my words some consideration.</p>
<p>You guys have a great night.</p></p>

        <p>It most certainly goes both ways, especially since there are a whole lot more people who hold strong beliefs about others needing to wear masks.</p>
<p>The vast, vast majority of people here have no problem either leaving or simply putting on a mask if asked to by the business. We recognize that businesses have a right to ask for their customers to wear one. That's fine. Our issues are with the governments that implement these harmful mandates, and the pro-maskers who demand that every person and business be exactly as afraid as they are - of which, there are many.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the majority of people who are reasons about it, I know that I’m talking to a minority of y’all here. Most anti maskers that come up to the gate are actually very calm and polite as long as the person greeting them is.</p>
<p>It’s the people who decide that we’re the ones they need to take their frustrations out on that I’m talking about.</p>

<p>If I tolerate your insane position it only makes other insane positions that much easier to tolerate. This results in an increase in insane positions to be dealt with. To reject outright all the insanity frees up a huge amount of time to deal with self interests.</p>

        <p>That only makes sense if it’s <em>my</em> position. But it’s not, if I had my way I wouldn’t be enforcing anything. Not because I agree that we shouldn’t be wearing masks per se, I just don’t really care if people don’t. But I don’t have my way because that’s how jobs work, you just put up with policies that you don’t like. </p>
<p>So why not just refuse to tolerate the company and avoid shopping there?</p>

        <p>For me, it would depend on how the employee approaches it.  If the employee is aggressive or hostile, then I am going to get hostile right back at them.  I will not be disrespected by some rando working at a store.  But if the employee was polite and just kind of going through the motions, I would just say "no thanks" and walk right past them.  Don't follow me around though, cuz then you're asking for it.  Instead, go directly to your manager and tell them that I declined to wear a mask.  Then it's your manager's responsibility to come talk to me about it.</p>

        <p>We have a gate, so you would have to push the worker aside in order to do this, which several people have elected to do. I am not aggressive at all, I try my best to be polite and understanding, but all I ever get back is aggression and hostility</p>

        <p>It’s kind of a makeshift gate, it’s just a plastic chain really. I’m standing in the center of it and “opens” from me grabbing one end of the chain and stepping aside. If there’s no one there you could easily just walk through it, one of the clips holding it together would give and it would fall to the floor in two pieces, but if there’s someone there you have to physically push them out of the way.</p>

        <p>If I catch on that someone is about to just walk through I’m definitely just stepping out of the way. Thing is most people who are willing to walk through the chain don’t give me much warning that they’re going to do so or time to get out of the way. </p>

        <p>I’m 100% with you, op. I think mask rules are retarded but as someone who has had to enforce them I get where you’re coming from. I hated having to enforce it more than having to wear one, actually.</p>
<p>There are some really aggressive people on this sub and I understand why they’re like that, because they feel cornered and their instinct is to lash out, which to me is something I get even though I’m not quite that way. </p>
<p>But not all of us are like that, I’m not and I fully agree we should treat retail workers with respect.</p>

        <p>Have you tried to get a different job? Because I can't think of anything more depressing than being the mask police for retail level pay.  </p>
<p>Or maybe transfer to a different department? </p>
<p>I've never been rude to anyone over it, but people are getting sick of this. It's only going to get worse when the states lift the mandates and corporate fascism refuses to stop trying to force us to muzzle up.</p>

        <p>I’m actively looking believe you me, and I definitely have already seen a flare up of anger over it, that’s what made me want to reach out and make this post.</p>
<p>I dunno, I guess I just wish people didn’t see me as the one to take out their frustrations on, but it can’t really be helped. I just wish they didn’t make us actually enforce anything. I work at another store as well and they also have a mask requirement but they don’t make us say anything about it.</p>
<p>I’ve literally had customers come up to me there and complain that people aren’t wearing masks and “why aren’t I doing anything about it” and I have to fight the urge to laugh and say “why don’t you give it a try, see how it goes.”</p>

        <p>I can sympathize. There aren't many chains that force employees to enforce mask rules. If I knew which one this was, I'd never shop there again. (Don't say it here, you don't need doomers trying to doxx you...)</p>

        <p>Part of it is the fact that the managers seem to have contempt for the people with exemptions. I saw a guy in a wheelchair with SEVERE cerebral palsy get told he couldn't buy food without a mask. The guy can't even talk or hold a pen, and some greasy slimeball manager is making his life even more of a living hell than it already is. If you won't stand up for someone with an exemption then you might deserve some blowback. All of these mandates provide exemptions, if these dirtball supervisors can only read the first part of the mask rule they can eat a bag of dicks as far as I can see.</p>

        <p>I don’t harass anyone, I just tell them that the businesses I work for doesn’t allow anyone in without a mask. It’s usually them who gets aggressive about it. </p>
<p>I don’t follow people through the store repeatedly asking them to put a mask on if that’s what you’re referring to. I’m not allowed to check people out if they don’t have masks on so they can’t really get service out of me if they don’t follow my company’s rules, but I don’t harass anyone.</p>

        <p>I don’t mean to dismiss anyone’s struggles, but I work retail to support myself, so I’ve had a pretty ugly year too. I’m sympathetic of the fact that it’s hard to be polite about things that frustrate you especially when it seems like everything’s a battle nowadays, but that’s not an excuse to take that out on someone unrelated to your misery.</p>

<p>Wasn't making any excuses.  Just kind of stating a fact of life now.  A significant percentage of the people who explode on you are at or near the end of their rope.  When they explode on you, it's not personal or thought out.  It's sort of like a dog trying to bite you.  You just have to jump out of the way or get bit.</p>

        <p>Define aggression then, because by the standard definition there is nothing aggressive about saying that masks are required for entry in a tone of voice specifically 
 to be polite and accommodating.</p>
<p>Or maybe there is no thought process and you see me not as a person but as an extension of the demagogue you claim to be fighting? Maybe you reject my humanity much in the same way you claim I reject the humanity of people like you?</p>
