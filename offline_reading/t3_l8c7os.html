    <strong>The most haunting effect I've had to see of the 'new normal'...</strong>
    <p><p>I went back to high school in fall hoping for things to get better, expecting to live somewhat normally, and yet all I've seen around me is Zombies... Nobody knows how to talk to anyone anymore. Remote learning + masks and social distancing have turned everyone into mute robots, like everyone forgot what it meant to be human. It's a totally peculiar phenomena... Halls of classes stocked with people in dead silence... There's no such thing as a meaningful conversation or just chilling with friends, and my own mental capabilities have gone down the gutter. The pain of being so close yet so far from all the friends and people I knew is hard to bear. </p>
<p>I still have another year after this to hope, just hope I get anything left out of my school years, but I don't think government has any intention of giving us back liberty rather than tightening their grip on the population. I can only imagine if my life is shit how hard it is for children in their young developmental years to have their socialization stripped away from them for a year at the least.</p></p>

        <p>Man this actually hit home for me. Im really sorry that shit sucks and theres no changing it. Hearing it from a teens perspective is eye opening to say the least. I have a 3 year old and i feel like a shitty parent every day because this is the life she has to live in now. Fuckin sad times but you gotta keep your chin up.</p>

        <p>That's crazy but it doesn't surprise me at all based on my own limited experience dealing with masks a the grocery store.</p>
<p>It is much more difficult to have a casual conversation when you can't see the person's face and their reaction to what your are saying and also it's just way harder to understand people without seeing their lips move.</p>
<p>I wonder if any sociologists were ever consulted as part of the corona response teams.</p>
