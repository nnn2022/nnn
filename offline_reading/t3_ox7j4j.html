    <strong>The Most Important Document about this "Pandemic" You Need to Read</strong>
    <p><p>If you look hard enough, it's all out in the open: <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/completed-projects/spars-pandemic-scenario.html">https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/completed-projects/spars-pandemic-scenario.html</a></p>
<p>In 2017, John Hopkins University ran a simulation on a Pandemic of a virus called "SPARS." This was a respiratory virus that originated out of East Asia and made it way out of the country by way of plane. The timeline in this story is October 2025 to August 2028, which can be reconstructed to about February 2020 to December 2022 in reality. Some other notable features of this simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original messaging is that people should simply wash their hands and continue their lives as normal. Remember the Fauci "skip the mask and wash your hands" and the NYC governor telling people to enjoy their lives? The same thing happens in the simulation, but they realize traditional methods of disease prevention don't work. Masks aren't mentioned, but lockdowns are the other method of disease prevention that the simulation employs.</li>
<li>A treatment was lauded by the leading scientist (Kalocivir), but later pulled due to side effects and an upcoming vaccine. Just like Remdesivir was approved, pushed by Fauci, and later pulled due to the ridiculous cost.</li>
<li>A vaccine called "Corovax" was developed by a biotech firm. The firm has no liability due to the PREP act, and there was a massive social media campaign to get people vaccinated. This included messages when you searched anything about the vaccine, including side effects. Sound familiar?</li>
<li>There was a push to use "expired antibiotics" after most of the widespread vaccination efforts were completed. These included framing the "antibiotics" (which can be seen as the vaccine in reality) as a way to treat lasting symptoms. With the leaked Pfizer contract that doesn't allow returns and the sudden push for more vaccines in arms, this part of the simulation is coming true.</li>
<li>In the simulation, vaccine side effects start to be more frequently posted on social media and VAERS data is publicly shared, and a bit later the long-term vaccine symptoms (6mo-1yr) start to show. These include neurological issues. Social media blows up, and people start trying to sue the pharma companies. Compared to reality, where we are starting to see more side effect posts and videos showing up on social media, and gofundme posts growing in numbers.</li>
<li>Onto the future. Congress is forced to intervene and settle people's grievances due to the side effects. The President is forced to acknowledge the ill effects of the vaccines, and his messaging includes either to "acknowledge the sacrifice that vaccine recipients had made on behalf of their communities or to console them in their grief over that sacrifice." Sounds pretty grim.</li>
<li>Oh, and by the way, the President is this simulation is elected after their predecessor resigns due to health issues. </li>
<li>The pandemic is declared over in the story's timeline of August 2028. A timeline reconstruction to the events of real life put this at about December 2022. And guess who else put a pretty firm timeline on the end of the pandemic at this time? Bill Gates, one of the funders of the simulation:   <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-billgates/bill-gates-says-world-should-be-back-to-normal-by-end-2022-due-to-vaccines-polish-media-idUSKBN2BH0SX">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-billgates/bill-gates-says-world-should-be-back-to-normal-by-end-2022-due-to-vaccines-polish-media-idUSKBN2BH0SX</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some inconsistencies in the story, like how the virus affects children more and the vaccine harms older people more. Obviously we are seeing that is the opposite of reality. In addition, there's a mention of power outages that take place in time-adjusted November 2020, but there was only a small grid failure in the northeast at that time. The Texas snow storm didn't come until February 2021.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you read it yourself. It's a shame most of the posts on this simulation do not get a lot of traction, but hopefully this write-out will.</p></p>
