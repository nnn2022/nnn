    <strong>Your desired outcome for those who are vaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>The new rules set in place are surely going to make this entire situation more dramatic than what we have seen before. Vaccinated people not wearing masks in stores, others probably going after them demanding to see their proof. It's how they behave, out of control and out of line.  </p>
<p>Now, while I do not wish for them to be harmed with this vaccine - I do want there to be some type of breaking point where they realize how crazy they have become, how they have treated us plague rats in the past year, and if maybe even get them to seriously regret getting the vaccine.  </p>
<p>I am wondering what types of scenarios could unfold where the things mentioned above happen. I am curious to hear your thoughts.  </p>
<p>On a side note - If it is real, the magnetic spot on your arm where the vaccine was administered is really starting to freak some people out.</p></p>

        <p>What do I want to happen to them? </p>
<p>Absolutely nothing. I want this vaccine to just be ineffective—about as useful as swimming trunks in Antarctica, but nowhere near as dangerous. It would be enough for me to have them quietly wake up and realize they’re wrong, and go back to being normal people. </p>
<p>I don’t want revenge, nor do I need an apology. I just hope they learn not to be so gullible.</p>

        <p>Some already are regretting it. I saw a legit post of a fathers twitter where in April he pushed his teenage son to get the vaccine and the son does. Then a few weeks later, on mothers day, his son dies. People double check and said it is a real twitter account. </p>
<p>My husband got some side effects after the second shot (minor thank God),but luckily they only lasted a week. But, it did scare him. We made sure he took a ton of aspirin to take care of the inflammation.</p>

<p>Sure, it will, OP.</p>
<p>Just like the residents of Jonestown regretted their choice to drink the Flavor-Aid. A lot of these people are true believers in the power of the golden syringe and will literally go to their (completely preventable) graves denying their magic potion put them there.</p>

        <p>I don’t want them to die horrible deaths, there are people I like who got this thing and my biggest worry is that they are going to die from it within the next couple of years. I don’t want that to happen. I want them to stop judging those of us who have chosen not to be injected with this. I want them to go back to being normal and stop acting like psychos. I really doubt that they will ever view us positively, it would be nice if eventually they did but at the rate things are going I don’t even think I’ll live that long for us to be vindicated. I honestly think some people are so broken from this they’re never going to go back to normal. I’m seeing quite a few people who got the vaccine who are afraid to stop wearing masks and they say they will wear them intermittently forever. My ideal outcome would be for them to realize they acted like lunatics and that we maintained our sanity and we are critical thinkers who did not let all of this propaganda get to us. I don’t see that happening though.</p>

        <p>I don’t wish death on anybody, but I do hope they have some issues, just so I can laugh. Issues like; A slur, a crippling walk, a tick, maybe paranoia. I’d like to see them suffer, but not die. Dying is horrible, because you know, “even if it saves one life.”</p>

        <p>The early polio vaccine was contaminated with a cancer virus. People didn’t figure it out for 30 years. The 1976 swine flu vaccine was linked to Gullain-Barre illness. That vaccine was heavily marketed and I’m not sure if it was rushed to market. Unintended consequences always happen. It’s unforeseen. I don’t wish it on anyone but I’m afraid it will happen. People I love got the vaccine.</p>
