    <strong>I hate how you're supposed to just accept this unending isolation</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a fairly introverted person. I only had a tiny handful of friends throughout my life and I grew apart from all of them thanks to some conflicts. My parents both died this year (not from corona) and I don't have any other relative that I could talk to. Meaning I spent this whole year pretty much alone in my appartment with only the rare, occasional human contact.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Well, a month ago I got a place at a daycare facility (is that the right term in english?) where adults with problems can stay during the day, socialize (with masks and enough distance) and do occasional activities. Right now there isn't too much to do there thanks to the pandemic, but the people seem nice and it is helping a little, though I'm not close with anyone there.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But I'm dealing with some new crap in my life right now that's stressing me out and a new lockdown might also be imminent in my region.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I was talking with my counselor there about my problems and especially my loneliness and the lack of activities to do and her attitude to that was pretty much a "well, too bad, there's nothing much to be done there". As well as saying that this situation will go on for much, much longer, so I might as well just power through it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And it's not only her. Every day the people there talk about the current situation, complaining about corona, complaining about the people not wearing masks, complaining about people not keeping distance, complaining about open schools and events that could spread the virus, etc. It's just complain, complain, complain every day, to the point I'm just tuning it out now to keep my own sanity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But when I complain about the isolation, I just get a shrug and a "oh well, nothing to be done there" and that I'm supposed to just "endure it".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But for how long? One year? Two years? Three?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What if my mental state deteriorates some more? What if I get suicidal or start self harming? (Hasn't happen at all, but I'm still worried it might happen if this keeps going on for much longer.) Am I just supposed to "power through it" then?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm so sick of this...</p></p>

        <p>I’m mostly hating the way people have casually just accepted lockdowns.  I keep hearing “ well in case we lockdown again “ or “ you know it’s gonna happen soon”</p>
<p>Is this where we are? Just casually accepting it as life. I hate it</p>

        <p>I'm among those wanting to get out of this backward, hideous world that we are all told to either accept, or be outcast.   Nobody cares about unemployment, suicides, lack of healthcare and everything else that is getting worse as the days go on. </p>
<p>You are only allowed to fear Covid, and if you don't, you are ruining the planet?...fuck that. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure it's too late now. </p>
<p>Nobody will let go of their masks, shields, rules and fear. Not at this point. They LOVE being "safe" and selfish.  </p>
<p>We have no way out, we can not stand up against it, we can not say anything about it.</p>
<p>I give up.</p>

        <p>Your community has gone deranged and hysterical and terminally fixated on covid.</p>
<p>As soon as they get their vaccine they will pretend that all the injury caused didnt happen.</p>
<p>If you're able to leave to a freer state, I would advise you to do so. </p>
<p>If I was not chained down by my dependent parents, I would have stored all my stuff in storage and move to South Dakota until the derangement stopped and their economy completely recovers.</p>

        <p>It’s ridiculous! I work at a bar that just reopened to the public and while almost none of our regular customers are buying into this nonsense, this jerk came in yesterday saying everything needed to shut down again. First of all, he’s a total hypocrite as he was there to drink, but second of all, where do you get off coming into my place of work and advocating for me to lose my job after already not being able to work there for 6 months? He started saying we need to be more like communist countries cause they got things under control. I said that’s literally the whole point of THIS country, we allow our citizens freedom. Anyway, I told him, and I truly believe ppl will not keep putting up with it. I know if they try to lock us down again, our bar will stay open. A lot of businesses in San Diego are not following the guidelines and the cops don’t care at all. Sorry that was a little bit of a vent on my part, but the point is I do think it will be over soon, most ppl are just waiting till after the election, and we do need to keep standing up for ourselves in the meantime!</p>

        <p>This is what they're doing to us. Most people feel this way but the narrative has been twisted so much that they agree when people say you're killing others if you don't comply with the measures. No one can question anymore if the measures work, or even what they're supposed to accomplish.</p>

        <p>Desiring human contact when there's a 1 in 200 chance that an 82 year old with terminal cancer could die this year instead of next is selfish. If our grandparents could survive the Great Depression and the Second World War, you can also put up with unnecessary suffering.</p>

<p>What the fuck? So this therapist just tells you to "power through" your mental health struggles? Have you thought about changing therapists? Cause that sounds like some bullshit. If they arent helping you what are you paying them for?</p>

        <p>My psychiatrist, whom I normally like, has basically been having this conversation with me when we've talked in the last few months. I talk about how not being able to do things or meet people in person is driving me crazy (I moved to a new city after the start of the pandemic so I know nobody here and can't just rely on arranging things with people I already knew). I'm looking to find ways to go out, do things, and meet people, and the response I get when I talk about this is that I can't do that while there's a pandemic and that continuing to live in a state that's driving my mental health through the floor is the best thing I can do right now.</p>

        <p>I used to live in a daycare like place for adults with problems, too. It's terrible how your new community and counselor have been so unsupportive. I remember how people ganged up on me at that place, and how counselors there didn't take me seriously, so it makes me shiver to imagine if I had lived there while this nightmare is going on.

        <p>I don’t know where you’re from, but here in the Netherlands the messaging is pretty clear: the measurements are in place until the vaccine is available to the general public, probably somewhere mid 2021. And the measurements should be in place to make sure the hospitals are not flooded, when the hospitals have enough space, the measurements are lessend.</p>

<p>I dont know about you, but that's not "pretty clear" to me. How many times has the vaccine promise timeline changed? Looking at history alone, expecting a rushed vaccine that is safe and effective was nothing but an empty promise, a pipe dream. Hospitals have had plenty of time to adequately prepare for the "flood" of sick people.</p>

        <p>Hoe many times has the vaccine timeline changed? I don’t think it has. They hope to have the first vaccines end of this year/beginning next year. And half a year to make it available to the public seems reasonable. I don’t know where you get your information but this is what they have been saying almost the entire time.. From March 2020 it was pretty clear this was going to take until summer 2021 for things to open up.</p>
<p>And hospitals have had plenty of time to prepare for the flood of sick people? I don’t know if that’s true. I can only talk about the local experience here in the Netherlands. But they have enough equipment and ventilators etc. They just don’t have enough people working at the hospitals. They say it takes years of training to be experienced enough to really help. They currently don’t really have enough capacity to continue normal operations.</p>
<p>And sure they could’ve just put way more money into health care / hospitals. That’s what Germany did. They don’t have any problems in their hospitals. But I guess that’s more something to consider moving forward long term. It’s not something you can solve in the short term, before there is a vaccine.</p>

<p>Do you have sources on that? We were originially told it would be over after a few weeks, and clearly that prediction was wrong.</p>

        <p>My government said most measures would be over in a few weeks when they introduced the lockdown in March, which they did. Currently the first hospitals in the Netherlands are declining new patients (covid or else) because they are full, and the government is adding more restrictions to prevent it. </p>
<p>https://nos.nl/l/2353434. Here is a Dutch article with the Dutch minister of health and our health experts (which still say masks are not really effective btw), but they are talking about the beginning of 2021 when the vaccine will probably be ready. It’s probably going to take another few months to make it available for everyone, the first people to get access will be vulnerable people.</p>
