        <p>The collateral damage of an overpaid government throwing it's citizens under the bus during a worldwide pandemic response.  Small businesses should have gotten way more help than they did.  On a worldwide stage, other countries would have expected the US to implement a pandemic response other than "ride it out".</p>
<p>Edit:  My suicide attempt has been addressed already, so I'm watching for signs of another since I've lost a father and a house so far. I feel more sorry for people who are new at this than I do for myself.  Plus, there will be some who will not be able to handle losing so many family members--so adding failed businesses, strained relationships, and homelessness will only add to the carnage.  The government should have made sure to help alleviate the financial strains, period.</p>

        <p>Does that 300k include people that had a positive test 6 months ago and then died of cancer? Or the ones that died in car accidents but happened to test positive for Covid in the post mortem?</p>
<p>I have no doubt people are dying from it, but the figures are being inflated and, combined with figures from wide scale horribly unreliable PCR testing, are being used as a means to justify unprecedented levels of government control over people’s lives.</p>
<p>THIS is what I have issue with. I’m happy to wear a mask if it makes other people comfortable. I’m not OK with decimating the economy over falsified data.</p>

        <p>No. It includes people who had cancer, got covid, and died of symptoms of covid. The figures are not being inflated. I'd love tos we your sources on that. We have actual evidence the figures are being toned down (infection rates, not death rates, at least) because if the scientist who came out and had her home raided. You're literally looking at the sky and saying it's green.</p>

        <p>The actual evidence of the figures being toned down is the woman who was arrested for proving they were. I'm not sure why they'd give a shit if she was some conspiracy theorist making shit up. Also your anecdotal evidence is nothing and you've either been lied to or are confused about what happened. Nobody gains anything from making up false covid deaths.</p>

        <p>Well yes but they're benefitting from the extended lockdown, not the plan that all the experts pressured us to follow. Also, what does this have to do with the deaths? And I'd love to know how this is happening on a mass level without some hospital worker having a huge expose.</p>

        <p>This is when men are allowed to be angry and upset. I lost my job and my apartment and thought about suicide, and I had someone I looked up to tell me they wanted to die because they lost their job too. This all happened before May ffs and it's just getting worse.</p>

        <p>I always thought that aligning your sense of self worth to your job and financial status causes this when you're a man.  I've tried to raise my boys not to do this, but now I'm beginning to think that it's really a result of men being assigned an identity based upon tangibles <em>by others</em>.  Since I've battled being occasionally suicidal from my teen years on up, I try to understand others that do it for other reasons. At what point does wanting to die come when you lose a job or business?  Does it come directly after the job loss? Does it come when you can't find another?  Or is it more prevalent when the job is lost, the money runs out, and you start to lose tangibles?</p>

<p>It's this but it's also inside and functions without external stimulus. A man must provide, not just for himself, which is the basic minimum, but for a family, and for his community. If I can't provide for my community, I am ashamed. If I can't provide for my family, I am depressed. If I can't provide for myself, I am a child. </p>
<p>The absence of productivity is complete dependence. Dependence for a healthy mentally sound adult is shameful and damaging. I think some men can handle dependence better than others, but for many it is a level of disgust, shame, and depression that cannot be lived with. Thankfully there are still enough jobs to be found. When men can't find jobs, the suicide rates skyrocket.</p>

        <p>What he wrote captures it perfectly. I was raised with this mindset because my own father was independent by 16. Self-reliance was the most important virtue to him, so much so that when I didn't have a part time job at 13 he called me a failure and told me it was too late and I would never amount to anything. To be honest, as an adult I actually really appreciate what he did because I ended up much harder working and independent than others my own age. However, I think because of how I was raised it was much harder to accept losing my job and home to external forces I couldn't control. Teach your kids how to fail.</p>

        <p>Poor Jack. I'm glad these people are sharing their story. Jack's death was not an unforeseeable consequence of a respiratory virus. The people in charge decided that it was acceptable. "If it saves one life"...one 90 year old with multiple pre-existing conditions you mean. Not a young person with many years ahead of them. </p>
<p>But also, let's not hype up mental health care too much - seeing a therapist isn't going to help him, or the millions of other young people in similar situations. Taking pills isn't going to help him. Returning to a workplace or school and attending social activities absolutely would have.</p>

<p>True. I understand people who often suggest therapy mean well, but therapy doesn't work if the environment doesn't change. This is why hotlines and virtual therapy is useless to some people. You can vent until you're blue in the face, but if what's causing it never changes, therapy will not fix it.</p>
<p>Not to mention not everyone lives in a household where it's safe to do that. One of the most important parts of therapy is that it's confidential. So, what good will it do when my family can hear everything?</p>

        <p>Downvote away! The TPTB do NOT care about this man's story. The mainstream media will not care about this young man unless they tested his dead body and is "positive" for COVID-19, that is the only way they will care.</p>
<p>These people that are running the show are just getting started, and until people wake up from their slumber, you're going to see more of this. Don't be shocked to see whole families off themselves because they've lost everything.</p>
<p>I feel for this man's family, unfortunately, the people just accepting this will ignore the real culprits and simply say this man was mentally weak, and just chose the easy way out; that is until it hits their door steps, then the chickens will come home to roost!</p>

        <p>"one has to balance struggle and death against the loss of freedom and dignity. To many of us [not many these days], freedom and dignity are more important than a long life or avoidance of physical pain.
