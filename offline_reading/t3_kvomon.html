    <strong>Questions for r/NoNewNormal</strong>
    <p><p>I stumpled upon this subreddit while browsing all/rising. After scrolling through a couple of pages I have some questions for y'all. Of course I am aware, that everyone will have individual answers, still interests me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Does COVID-19 exsist?</li>
<li>Is COVID-19 dangerous?</li>
<li>Was this whole pandemic planned?</li>
<li>Are mainstream news telling the facts?</li>
<li>Will you vaccinate yourself? Do you think vaccines work? </li>
</ul>
<p>I am open to discussions of course, just stay civil.</p>
<p>I see that a lot of people here label themselves as critical thinkers. The part I don't understand, is that these critical thinkers seem to oppose mainstream news, thinking that these news outlets must be corrupt and lying.</p>
<p>Some seem to think, that this pandemic is used by socialists to change the US to their liking. </p>
<p>Now, as someone who's deep into skepticism and critical thinking, it seems strange that the critical thinkers in this sub seem to decide for themselves which facts are true, and which aren't. Depending on if they fit their own narrative.</p>
<p>And that's what irks me the most. The whole idea seems to be to think freely and critically. Creating your own facts and ignoring everything which doesn't fit your world-view is the exact opposite of free thinking, and I'm not sure if everyone here understands this.</p>
<p>I think it's absolutely terrible for businesses having to close. I'd rather not wear masks, because no mask is of course the most comfortable option. I would like to go to the cinema, the beach, meet friends at a bar etc.</p>
<p>But people are dying, there's a virus spreading we can't yet really control. So as long as the vaccine isn't widely available and governments aren't declaring that the situation is finally under control, I am sacrificing my comfort and likings to protect the people in danger.</p>
<p>For me it's about solidarity and helping each other out.</p>
<p>We can see how many people are diagnosed as positive and how many are dying, even though there's a lockdown and people are being careful. I don't even want to imagine what would happen if there were no restrictions. </p>
<p>I also don't understand the argument about mainstream news fear-mongering. They report numbers and new events. It's you who's scared about the news, maybe just don't read them instead of blaming them. Sounds to me like watching a horror movie and then complaining that it scared you. </p>
<p>I just read about new rules and restrictions and ignore the rest. I'm not scared by this pandemic, we'll get through it. But we have to work together.</p>
<p>Stay safe.</p></p>

        <p>All in this together....but only if we follow what we are told. No matter how much it doesn't make sense. Only if we accept that nothing other than covid is a problem. </p>
<p>There is no working together when everything that is not covid is ignored.</p>

        <p>If you want to work together, you need a common plan and goal. If everyone does what they think is right, that's not working together, that's working for yourself. And if a group of experts and science in general thinks something makes sense, why should every single human be asked if they agree? I haven't studied virology, psychology, economy or whatever, I let the experts decide. And that's not sheep-behaviour, I just think that experts should do what they've trained for. </p>
<p>COVID unfortunately is the "biggest" problem at the moment, you know. It's global, deadly and spreads fast. I put biggest in quotes, because of course it can be argued that wars, social security, homelessnes or whatever can be seen as a bigger issue. But these problems always existed. They can still be tackled after the pandemic is under control.</p>
<p>What bigger problem should be put higher than COVID, according to you?</p>

        <p>I'm not suggesting anything to be put higher than covid. What should be happening is things not being ignored because of it. You know, like cancer patients treatment being stopped knowing fine well that by denying that, you are leaving them facing only death. (Not all cases, but more than there should be). </p>
<p>That is the problem. The fact covid is being placed above everything and nothing else matters. That is not right. You dont need to focus on only one thing at a time. What good is that really? Just look around you at the devastating impact it has had when they have focused on one issue.</p>

        <p>&rt;like cancer patients treatment being stopped</p>
<p>That's a difficult topic, yeah. Triage. Of course a cancer patient dying, because someone with COVID was treated instead is a tragic thing. Would you also consider it tragic if a COVID patient died, because a cancer patient was being treated instead?</p>
<p>&rt;The fact covid is being placed above everything and nothing else matters</p>
<p>The problem is, that COVID can't be ignored. You can ignore wars, homelessnes or whatever temporarily, but a virus just continues to spread, you can't just ignore it.</p>
<p>If people get infected in restaurants and this restaurant needs the money to stay open, you still can't just leave it open. It's a bankrupcy vs. faster spread of a virus. As unfortunate as it as, and as much as it sucks, a business existing should have less priority than people not dying.</p>
<p>Of course, the businesses should get financial help. But the US doesn't like social help, so there's that.</p>

        <p>Its not that a covid patient is being treated instead of a cancer patient. The other issues are completely bypassed and ignored. This was happening when doctors and nurses were twiddling their thumbs the first time round. Yes, some were busy but not all. There were hospitals built specifically for covid, and yet they were never used. Instead they chose to close off access to treatment for others. </p>
<p>You can say you can ignore these things, but you're really just burying your head in the sand here. Closing up a business could result in debt, homelessness, starvation and death. Youre just seeing homelessness or a closed business. </p>
<p>Why should that be less important than a covid patient?</p>

<p>&rt; What bigger problem should be put higher than COVID, according to you? </p>
<p>The much, much, much deadlier problem of famine and malaria / TB vaccination, which has been massively exacerbated by lockdowns, but that doesn't affect pampered Westerners so they (you?) don't see it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, well thanks for linking an alternative plan. That still doesn't change my statement. Science, in general, still agrees, doesn't matter if one small group thinks otherwise. </p>
<p>We live in democracies, where the major opinion gets elected as the one we go with. How else would you manage such a thing? We can't regard every fringe opinion.  </p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I can actually reverse your second statement. You know how much I talk to people about famine, social injustice, how wrong it is to start and maintain wars, that we should care about homeless, disabled, poor etc. people? But no one seems to give a shit, because it does not matter to them.</p>
<p>But oh noooo, now these people have to wear masks :'( And that annoys them so much that they start protesting against it, making statements and creating new subreddits etc. </p>
<p>I wish people would use this fucking energy for other issues, but as you correctly said, people only fucking care about their petty asses. I'm just sick of all these whiny, pathetic people. Only speaking out when their privilege is temporarily reduced.</p>
<p>Everyone in this sub is screaming for businesses to remain opened, because otherwise people will loose their jobs, houses etc. But do they care about jobless or homeless people in general? Of course not, only when it could affect them for once. Now </p>
<p><strong>385,000</strong> people died in the US alone, but sure, let's reopen everything. And because y'all like to compare it to the flu so much, in 2019  <strong>34,200</strong> died from the flu. </p>
<p>But I'm sure you'll argue that the death count is wrong, and that everything is faked. </p>
<p>Welcome to the 20's, the decade of "alternative" facts. What's that, a fact is different than my opinion? Better search for an alternative fact which fits my narrative.</p>
<p>Einstein, Galilei and others would turn in their graves if they'd see what some people think about science.</p>

        <p>I bitterly regret having to agree with the vast majority of that ;)</p>
<p>Yet it just goes to show: fellow citizens aren't our enemies. There's nothing innately wrong with people saying lockdowns' affects on poverty, mental health, and other diseases worldwide are unacceptable. There's also nothing wrong with saying certain things should be closed in order to contain a crisis. There is nothing wrong with saying we need to have open discussions about it and compromise, as we live in a democracy - specifically, a democracy which respects individual rights.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> something wrong with select scientists on government payrolls - or the payroll of one NGO in particular - completely dominating policymaking with no scrutiny or oversight, and a bunch of tech oligarchs censoring any alternative while they make unprecedented profits. There <em>is</em> something wrong with attacking our neighbours for merely attempting to live their lives when tax-dodging oligarchs and malicious ministers - the sole reason we're in this mess - get off scot-free. This sub might not exist if the under-privileged actually had a voice, and the democratic principles you evoke had been enacted. But there were not.</p>

        <p>100% agree with your first paragraph. I'd just rather unnecessarily close everything and being too catious, instead of leaving everything open and loosing control even more. At least at the moment we don't have any food shortages and the like. We should still care about the people affected by business closures, but I'm an employee who's working at the moment, don't know if businesses are completely on their own, or if they receive money etc.</p>
<p>I don't know about the NGO payroll part. I mean I don't know how bad that is. Because every country has their own task-force and rules, so it's not like we have the same conditions world-wide. </p>
<p>Attacking neighbors is of course wrong, yes. Althought I have to say, it annoys me when I purposefully don't go to the washroom when there are other people in there, but they just come in and do their laundry right next to me. They could wait until I'm done, but that's a small detail.</p>
<p>And tax-dodging oligarchs and malicious ministers unfortunately always do what they want. Always has been, probably always will be like that. I don't think we should use that as an excuse not to behave. I know it's unfair for me that I want to be a "role-model" while uber-rich or just other people don't give a damn, but there's always a reason to feel under-privileged.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I mean how do you handle a situation, where some people don't want any restrictions. You can't just let them do what they want. I think it's these people who should show some compassion and solidarity, instead of everyone having to be at risk. But maybe I'm seeing it too shallow.</p>

        <p>All of your top questions can be answered with "capitalism". Everything is corrupt, because all that counts is profit, revenue and stock numbers. We allow corporations to lobby for policies which advandage them. The US has lots to learn in terms of healthcare, taxation and other social issues. Humans become corrupted if all they see is business opportunities and $$$.</p>
<p>The Nazis were the bad guys. First I wanted to write Germany as a whole, but a lot of innocent people existed there. Of course the Axis Powers can be blamed as a whole, but I'd say the Nazis were the worst of all. Who do you think were the bad guys?</p>

        <ul>
<li>Does COVID-19 exsist?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, it's the disease caused by an infection of the virus SARS-COV-2</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Is COVID-19 dangerous?</li>
</ul>
<p>Best evidence after a year says it depends on the person. &lt;60 healthy, no it's not dangerous.</p>
<p>Over 60's if healthy it's a mild sickness. </p>
<p>Elderly and immuno-compomised or those with underlying conditions it can be serious.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Was this whole pandemic planned?</li>
</ul>
<p>No if you are saying it's a bio weapon control conspiracy etc. The reaction to it being a pandemic had to be, in some way.  But, most countries declared the COVID-19 pandemic over around April last year. The big businesses and governments making $ £ from this, well they just turn a crisis into an opportunity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are mainstream news telling the facts?</li>
</ul>
<p>No, do they ever? They're telling you the 'news' to get viewers.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Will you vaccinate yourself? </li>
</ul>
<p>No, I'm fine thanks, I don't feel at risk enough to need one.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you think vaccines work?</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe, I'm no immunisation expert. Is the proof 100%, no, science never is, it's an on-going study. Are there some out there that help, I believe so. How do they work, god knows.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the tests being used so an infection of SARS-COV-2?</li>
<li>Are people being hospitalised by SARS-COV-2?</li>
<li>How many cases of SARS-COV-2 are leading to the disease COVID-19?</li>
<li>Should the tests be used to diagnose the disease?</li>
<li>What are the folks in hospital being admitted with, is it an infection of SARS-COV-2?</li>
<li>What are the folks in hospital sick or dying with, is it COVID-19?</li>
<li>Should lockdown measures be based on positive test results?</li>
<li>Does asymptomatic transmission of SARS-COV-2 exist?</li>
<li>If you can catch COVID-19 with a droplet of water from someone else, why do we need a 5 minute swap from the back of the throat and a whole lab test to find it?</li>
<li>Is heard immunity through natural transmission proven?</li>
<li>Will the vaccines stop transmission?</li>
<li>Will the vaccines stop infection?</li>
<li>Will the vaccines stop symptoms and complications from symptoms?</li>
<li>What is the 'end game' measure to remove all restrictions and measures?</li>
<li>When are people 'allowed' to make a risk assessment of their own?</li>
<li>Why are there very few cases of flu and other annual hospitalisations and deaths?</li>
<li>Why has so much money been spent on control measures and not expansion of healthcare?</li>
<li>Why do governments keep trying the same things over and over?</li>
<li>Why are all governments trying different things for the same virus?</li>
<li>Why have some countries faired better than others, and why are others not following suit?</li>
<li>Why in a global pandemic have pharma companies not been told to work together, share all info, and don't concentrate on bringing your own drugs to market?</li>
<li>Are people catching a variety of coronaviruses and being thrown into one pot?</li>
<li>Why are the listed symptoms so different from the life threatening COVID-19 symptoms when discovered?</li>
<li>Why do the symptoms mirror those of colds and flus?</li>
<li>Where is all the money coming from for lockdown 'measures'?</li>
<li>Where is it going to be paid back from?</li>
<li>Why (in the UK) this week have the Gov recorded 37 cases of COVID-19, yet there's 46000 cases in a day and 529 deaths in a day? Cases of what? Deaths from what?</li>
<li>One the media report staggering good news stories of those vaccinated vulnerable, will folks relax and get back to normal? </li>
<li>What actually are we trying to control, and achieve to get back to normal?</li>
<li>Has anyone asked granny what she wants, or has she been scared enough to lock herself away, convinced a vaccine is her only means to let her kids get back to normal, and is so confused she's lost touch with the real world.</li>

        <p>I have my own questions, some of which are mostly locally in my city and others are universal.</p>
<p>Why aren't the govt's promoting zinc, ivercertin,. Vitamin D, all of which are prove to improve symptoms</p>
<p>Why are governments pushing the same partial lockdowns that are essentially useless?</p>
<p>Why is it that in swine flu 2009, it was basically nothing,despite it being statistically way more dangerous?</p>
<p>Why is it that strains are hyped up? Covid has mutated 12000 times according to a lab, and certainly it has mutated many times, even during early days of COVID in China, it mutated when it went to guangdong, so it's a fast mutating virus that decreases with lethality over time.</p>
<p>Why are the governments using fines? The riches don't give a shit about being fined.</p>
<p>Why are police officers being used to fine others?</p>
<p>Why all the empty hospitals?</p>

        <p>Hey there, appreciate your genuine enquiry.</p>
<p>I can answer for myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes, I had it, intense fever for a few days, took a week to get over it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not really, to healthy people, it's dangerous in particular if your over 70 with other comorbidities. About 1/1000 die from it, a further 1/1000 have long term affects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems so, increasingly, with every passing day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mainstream media are providing a very narrow framing of conversation, hedging the discussion. On top of that, no - no critical analysis of data, bleating out what they are fed. They are complicit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No I will not vaccinate myself or family. Yes vaccines that go through proper testing and development can be beneficial - although benefits are generally overstated and risks minimised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not in the US. I knew when this first kicked off, the narrative of "the new normal" and things "never going back to how they were" from the very beginning, the lack of questioning voices in media, aggressive censorship, lack of discussion on preventative health care.....  All data points / red flags that something was seriously off.</p>
<p>My initial hit has been re enforced, with ever changing measures, threats of severe measures to let less severe in, misreporting on deaths, gaslighting etc... Of those with honest concerns.... The hypocrisy, the blindness to increase in suicides, heart related deaths, cancer (no treatment).... All from a Government who has had austerity measures in place for almost a decade, causing over a hundred thousand deaths (to apparently save money) - now they are splurging money with no concern - because they care for us so much 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>It is the very definition of boiling the frog, how things are progressing.</p>
<p>I believe that every human heart, deep down knows that this doesn't add up, unfortunately the conditioning is so effective, and the desire to fit in, and the pain of seeing the world as it truly is - has people continue to choose a comfortable lie over painful truth.</p>
<p>But - more and more are waking up, there is still hope.</p>
<p>I assess, this is the single greatest threat to humanity it has ever faced. 1984 quote of a boot stamped down on a human face - forever = where we are heading. In a soft gloved, authoritarian, medicalised police state.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

<li>Sorry to hear that, glad that you're well now.</li>
<li>Yeah, that's how I see it as well. I am not really scared for my health. I am scared that I could spread it without knowing, eventually passively killing someone because I wasn't careful.</li>
<li>What advantage does it give to anyone, if this whole thing is planned? What's to gain from this?</li>
<li>I guess it depends on which outlet you follow.</li>
<li>The way I understand it, the COVID vaccines were developed by international teams with de facto unlimited budgets, which is the reason it can be developed much faster. Because there was a common, urgent goal. </li>
</ul>
<p>I think that this is just an extraordingly strange situation. A world-wide virus, which has to be tackled by everyone. Humans constantly make mistakes, that's why I don't think too much about what's done wrong and focus on the good things. I am glad that I don't have to be one of the people who have to decide how to handle this pandemic. They can only do their best.</p>
<p>I'd disagree that we are heading into soft gloved, authoritarian, medicalised police states. I think the world slowly sees that we have to stop exploting our planet, that wars aren't the answer and that we have to implement social securites, because the well-being of everyone is the only good cause. </p>
<p>Surveillance Capitalism is an issue I see, however that gets tackled more and more as well.</p>
<p>All the best to you, too.</p>

        <p>Well... there's a few points for me to respond to.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>thankyou - dealt with months ago, and on the scale of things its no big deal, I've got much bigger problems to contend with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, seems we have common ground there. I also would not want to be the cause of anyone becoming ill. My stance for some time, is that the appropriate response, would be to offer support/funding/care for those in vulnerable groups - so they can choose to isolate/wear protective gear/minimise risk - should they so wish. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But for me, to worry about infecting others to the exclusion of: worrying about the lack of treatment and diagnosis of cancer and heart conditions, rising suicide rates, mental health increases, mothers giving birth alone, old people dying alone, the breakdown of society and community, future generations being burdened by incredible levels of debt etc.... is an imbalanced position only possible by swallowing the unrelenting narrative by the established media.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>that is a good question, and one worth investigating... fundamentally  one could surmise in short: money, power, control - the usual motivations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All established media outlets are complicit and compromised, we know that by observing their actions. Even government org's in support of the agenda - like the CDC (check official survival rates) and the uk's ONS (there was a recent post here independently checking the data, showing that many deaths were being counted twice in the official statistics) - show the fallacy of the approach we take.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IF you're open to an alternative news source, I'd recommend "off-guardianDOTorg" it has a special tab for the virus articles, with many links to world leading experts speaking out against the actions being taken.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, that is the narrative. Which still does not explain how quickly the vaccines came about, nor the high rates of adverse effects, nor the protection manufacturers have against claims for ill effect, nor the rich and famous taking dummy shots, Nor the fact it doesn't stop spread, nor guarantee immunity, nor mean you can go about your life as a result of taking one, nor explain the high deathrate in certain carehomes where it has been rolled out.</li>
</ul>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'd agree it is strange. I personally find it impossible to not see the bad things - as they are being so wilfully ignored by so many, the terrible costs as a result of the disproportionate and nonsensical response, that ultimately means the cure is infinitely worse than the disease. I would trust any normal many or woman, when presented with all information - to make a better response than what is happening now. The only good that I see, is that pain is the great awakener - and more and more people are waking up.</p>
<p>They are literally telling us where we are going, and have done since the very beginning.</p>
<p>I agree that we need to stop exploiting the planet, each other, other species. I also want a better world for us all.</p>
<p>But these valid causes, are piggybacked as a vehicle for the carrying out of what they want to achieve (i.e. world economic forum - the great reset). The things that you and I hope for will not come to pass. Certainly not in the way it is advertised.</p>
<p>The only way this ends, is when the people refuse to comply. Things will continue to get worse, our freedoms will continue to bleed away. This all started in the UK with "just two weeks to flatten the curve".</p>
<p>Thankyou for the discussion.</p>

<li>covid has never been isolated or identified, no</li>
<li>depends on your overall health/pre existing conditions</li>
<li>coordinated and planned? Not exactly, but how can one deny the lockstep following of the lockdown model China had set?</li>
<li>depends on the topic, mostly lies and emotionally triggering language</li>
<li>if the vaccine is safe and there is an imminent deadly threat, maybe. Vaccines can work, but many have harmed a lot of people and these shots arent preventing transmission.
These injections for treating covid symptoms are not vaccines, they are something new, they cannot be injecting you with covid19 because they dont have it to inject</li>

<li>100% agree</li>
<li>You mean that their case numbers stayed stationary? I found that weird too. I think that has more to do with them wanting to have a good image, than them having planned something.</li>
<li>Definitely true. That's why I only read news from official newspapers. No boulevard, no celebrity-bullshit etc.</li>
<li>Tend to agree here. Although I've listened to a lot of experts saying that the process is new, but should be fully working. I have faith in science, so I trust them and will get a vaccine. Even though we know that there <em>could</em> be shortcomings.</li>

<li>No. They are supporting the narrative. Also, the narrative suits them, because the consumption of the media has gone up with the pandemic. Many people who didn't watch the news started watching the news. </li>
<li>Yes and yes. Vaccine is when this is planned to end. Then our next worry will be 'climate lockdowns'. Instead of flattening the hospital curve, we'd be staying home to flatten the carbon curve because of climate emergency. This BS seems forever, but it is actually only temporary until they come up with new, even worse BS. COVID lockdowns end with a vaccine, when tf climate lockdowns gonna end.</li>

<p>I obviously can't know exact names of those people. I believe they are a big team and they are fighting many years to push agendas to the world. What they've gained? Simple. Control. A lot of control. That's what they love the most. Being able to control everything and everyone. They wish to create a terrible technocratic world upon humanity where humans are nothing more than biological robots. How do you make such a big change to the world? Rebuild it completely, from top to bottom. How can you rebuild it? Create a crisis. Destroy everything, society, economy, supply chains, just create a chaos. And then, build it again under your terms. Does all that sound fiction and consiracy theories to you? They're not. I'd suggest you look up better. Search for "The Great Reset" from the World Economic Forum, "The Fourth Industrial Revolution" from Klaus Schwab, "Agenda 2030" from the UN and look on what they truly entail. Then, connect the dots yourself.</p>

        <p>At this point there are more than enough credible professionals speaking out against all aspects of this. That we can confidently say Covid is a debunked conspiracy and the immensely harmful lockdowns are definitely not worth it. </p>
<p>In years to come many will lie and say they never supported the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>&rt;We can see how many people are diagnosed as positive and how many are dying</p>
<p>And this is my exact problem. We have never "counted deaths" like we do for Covid.</p>
<p>Imagine if we tested everybody for strands of influenza virus right now. Maybe you have a bit in you? Maybe I do?</p>
<p>Let's also make sure that we test as many people in senior's environments as possible! Many of those people are just about to die!</p>
<p>And then anyone who tests "positive" for a strand gets called a "flu case".</p>
<p>(You and I would get called "asymptomatic flu cases").</p>
<p>And then if <em>any</em> of all those "cases" dies from anything lung- or heart- related over the next month or 2, they can get called a "influenza death".</p>
<p>If we tallied up "flu deaths" like that .. we would have <em>much</em> higher-looking flu death numbers.</p>

        <p>&rt;Does COVID-19 exsist?</p>
<p>Yes. I and my family are swine flu survivors and it was like a bad flu for us, I assume covid is similar.</p>
<p>&rt;Is COVID-19 dangerous?</p>
<p>Depends on who you are, if you're a 300lbs 90 years old man with diabetes and 5 other chronic diseases, otherwise no.</p>
<p>&rt;Was this whole pandemic planned?</p>
<p>Yes, it's a staged pandemic. Why aren't govt's doing what's actually useful, like full lockdowns, encouragement of vitamin D and doing same useless stuff over and over again? Also people filming empty hospitals gets arrested, there's so many fishy things I could name. COVID isnt fake but the pandemic is very much a stage.</p>
<p>&rt;Are mainstream news telling the facts?</p>
<p>No. Always breaking news, record covid cases, but no mention of daily people leaving the hospital, news doesn't promote health living either which is necessary to reduce covid symptoms.</p>
<p>&rt;Will you vaccinate yourself? Do you think vaccines work?</p>
<p>No. I won't vaccinate myself, if I could survive swine flu which is statistically more dangerous, I could get over this with ease. I'm not sure if vaccines work, but I've heard nasty things about them.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&rt;Is COVID-19 dangerous?</p>
<p>About as dangerous as e-coli, overall. Obviously the risk for certain groups is much higher.</p>
<p>&rt;Was this whole pandemic planned?</p>
<p>Probably not, but <em>a</em> pandemic was inevitable and using a crisis is not only easy but central to a government's job.</p>
<p>&rt;Are mainstream news telling the facts?</p>
<p>They are telling us some facts. Obviously they don't tell us facts that contradict their editorial slant or financial interests, because of course they don't. Why would anyone think that they do and when did they start thinking that?</p>
<p>&rt;Will you vaccinate yourself? Do you think vaccines work?</p>
<p>I aim to get the AstroZeneca vaccine. Hopefully they don't make it compulsory, because then I will refuse. I am unsure whether these SARS-CoV-2 vaccines actually provide immunity and so are the companies that made them.</p>
