    <strong>West Coast Sadness?</strong>
    <p><p>Any west coast people out there feeling the pain, with these wildfires?</p>
<p>I’m in Portland. The air is now cold, presumably because so little sunlight is getting through the smoke. The sky is orange. It hurts to breathe even inside your house - it truly isn’t safe or comfortable to leave. It feels post-apocalyptic. And gives me flashbacks from our long, needless  lockdown in the spring. </p>
<p>One of the only ways I stayed sane during this pandemic was hiking and walking, and sometimes just driving to the ocean just to gaze upon where the continent ends and vast, wild sea begins. Driving to random small towns. Telling myself, hey look the world is still out there. </p>
<p>That is not possible now. </p>
<p>I’ve had some of my worst days of the year this week. Yesterday I cried and screamed until I almost lost my voice. Am I the only one?</p></p>

        <p>I'm in a similar spot in Cali. Hiking on my days off kept me sane because literally everything else is still closed, but now thats gone for who knows how long. Can't go jogging outside either. Can't even eat outdoors in a restaurant now. Still 0% indoor dining capacity.</p>
<p>I'm beyond frustrated. These massive fires are the result of not managing forests and powerlines for decades and the politicians keep saying its climate change. At least when I go to my governors twitter feed, people are attacking him for saying that whereas in the past people would be agreeing. And I've seen quite a few local stories about people being arrested in Oregon for arson. </p>
<p>The entire situation right now feels like damned if you do damned if you don't. Stay strong man, best of luck to you.</p>

        <p>Thanks. Of course it helps tremendously to know I’m not the only one. You stay strong too.</p>
<p>And yeah; I both believe in climate change AND believe that poor forest management practices are at the heart of the west’s problems (fire is a part of the west’s ecosystem and always has been and always will be). Seeing politicians reduce it to just climate change just deepens my sadness because it reminds me that leaders prefer rabid hysteria and simple-minded  blame games over thoughtful, brave, data-driven leadership. Which just reminds me that lockdowns will be here for a long damn time. And then I’m even sadder.</p>

        <p>In Vancouver, its pretty much the same thing. Stopped going out. Second place in the world for worst air quality lol. I actually ran a bit yesterday because I don't look at much news nowadays, and my throat felt scratchy.</p>
<p>It shouldn't last too long though. Once in rains in the place where the wildfire is, it will subside very quickly. Then rain where you live will clear up the air too.</p>
<p>Try not to feel too bad about the fire guys. Unlike the lockdowns this WILL go away quickly.</p>

        <p>Supposedly sprinkles Tuesday and real rain Thursday; with winds cooperating starting today. I pray similar or better conditions for you. </p>
<p>I know it’s temporary, which is why I’m surprised it has freaked me out so much. The flashbackS to our hard lockdown were really unexpected. And made me realize I have a lot of unprocessed grief and rage about it. I became extremely agitated and inconsolable this weekend. Thinking “I can’t leave, I can’t leave, I CANT LEAVE.”</p>
<p>Siiiigh.</p>

        <p>You know what they say! When it rains it pours. The irony in that statement in regards to this scenario!</p>
<p>The weather channel says rain on Friday here. IMO they are notoriously inaccurate. Really though its the places with the wildfire that needs rain. Even droplets of water from the sky are far more effective in dousing the fires than any human operation.</p>
<p>I'm not in a good place either. Fight back.</p>

        <p>It would have to be flying. It would be a full 6+ hours drive through the smoke to get out of it. That also leads to claustrophobia. Being more than a day away by car from safe air.</p>
<p>But I’m looking at flights now. I’ve left the state as much as possible during the pandemic, and that has kept me sane, too. Thanks man.</p>

        <p>Of all the things that got me to wear a mask, it was the smoke. I am in B.C. btw</p>
<p>I run it under cold water and wear it if I need to go out because otherwise I get no semblance of oxygen. What cruel irony. Im desperately waiting for rain.</p>

        <p>i wish we could send you some of our endless rain, kitten 😰 it's been so grey and dreary and dismal here. usually monsoon season in the Mid-Atlantic is broken up by lots of warm, sunny days, but August was just bleak and wet and hot, like a broke-ass London. honestly, i don't even know how i could live with the threat of wild fires, seriously. and on top of state-imposed house arrest? fuck that. i'm so sorry. i'd be scared too, and i totally understand the impulse to run. i'm sure you wish you could fly.</p>
<p>please stay safe, please find something to do indoors that brings you an escape and inner peace. i don't know if that's reading or binging movies/tv, or baking/cooking, maybe it's yoga, maybe it's booze, maybe it's sleep. goodness this sucks, right? you're like a bird, holed up in a tree trunk.</p>
<p>it's hard for me to tell you stay inside, because that's bullshit and you know it. for me, i felt much better last week, as we've been able to turn the A/C off at night and open the windows, and now our walks are cool and a crisp breeze whips about our ankles. i haven't really felt fall in awhile - it's been a few years without an indian summer - and it's here, and it makes me feel alive. i want to send you our cool autumn breeze and brisk nights, and the sharp shenandoah sky.</p>
<p>i can't tell you to stay inside, just make good choices. this too shall come to pass.</p>

        <p>No, you're definitely not the only one.  I live in CA.  We're a fiery hellscape, too.</p>
<p>&rt; And gives me flashbacks from our long, needless lockdown in the spring.</p>
<p>Except for me, spring was better, because I never obeyed shelter-in-place to the extent where I stopped hiking.  I simply went hiking alone and kept true physical distancing with other hikers, didn't stop at anywhere public except gas.  And then once I knew the actual IFR, around early April, I started hiking with friends again.  We simply had to find the "loophole" trails which were not owned by cities or counties, and thus were not closed.  Spring, at least, had good weather and beautiful flowers, in between rainy days.  But this....this is awful.  It's like what spring would have been if I'd 100% obeyed the "shelter in place" rules.  I'm so glad I disobeyed back then.  This has taken a huge toll on my mental health.</p>
<p>Because of the fires, I had to cancel the one thing I had to look forward to all year--through-hiking the High Sierra Trail to Mt Whitney.  It would have been over a week away from Clown World, in the beautiful mountains.  Instead they caught fire, and so did all my local mountains, and then the air quality turned to shit so I couldn't even exercise outdoors at home.  Last week was when I was supposed to have left for the HST.  I was very, very angry.  And depressed.  All week.  Drank way more than I should to cope.  This week, at least, is slightly better.  My friends and I have figured out which areas are fire-free and have decent air quality, so I am able to get in some exercise.  </p>
<p>Hopefully the winds will change directions for you, too, so you can get a day or two of clean air for a "break".   </p>
<p>I realize this won't last forever, but after living in Clown World for 6 months straight dealing with this for even a whole month is devastating to our mental health.</p>

        <p>The ENTIRE state of Oregon looks like a gross open sore on the air quality map. We’d have to drive for 8 hours at this point to get to fresh air.</p>
<p>I hate Portland so much. I am trying to get out of here as fast as humanly possible. I can’t wait to load the uHaul.</p>
