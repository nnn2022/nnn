    <strong>Thank You!</strong>
    <p><p>Thank you to everyone here supporting this group.  I’ve only just “joined” today but have been viewing for months. Can only imagine how many others out there like me! You all have gave me 1) peace of heart 2) peace of mind 3) sanity - for months now.  So thankful for this gift!  </p>
<p>Quick background my community is very sick.  One of the most financially “well-off” and educated (PhDs per capita etc) in the US.<br>
Most here have homes &rt;$500k and judge their worth on their crazy vehicles and vacations etc - think ‘keeping up with The Jones’.  The moms groups here are very sick and I’ve got off of all FB now (even though it is nice to see folks from my hometown and normal people).  </p>
<p>Had to get off because can not control myself anymore.  These “kind moms” socially shame and call out others to the point of trying to get people fired. And I’m not talking about disagreeing with their narrative (no one dares to do that online)... I’m talking people wearing masks and distancing (example plumbing service) still shamed them cus the mask was not “sufficient grade enough” and they got “a little too close”.  Someone posted a picture of some young adults in a home for a movie, drinks, stay in/chill in PJs - they freaking stalked these people!!! (one is a local Dr from reading the posts).  What if he could loose his job?  No one cares they egg and dare each other on!!!</p>
<p>Knew from the elections the sickness of it all.  Mob mentality.  They would try to provoke others and if anyone supported Trump they would out them as a white supremacist.  Like wtf even people of color, just say they are brainwashed or whatever if they supported him.  My spouse is black but I’m a racist of course, down with black people!</p>
<p>If people think most people are just going to come around NO sorry - not happening.  Only hope is to find likeminded folks.</p>
<p>My only point above in talking about $ or education is to say this is a level you can’t reach because they are THE FOLLOWERS!!! This is the middle class!!! Their education has taught them this is correct.  </p>
<p>My education taught me critical thinking skills, my education taught me question the narrative, my education taught me 1+2+3= 6.  We are the same, these are the people I went to high school with, or had the college adventures with, or listened to music and partied all night with there is no hope for the majority of humanity in the US.</p></p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>The social current these past many years has been trending towards cultural melange predicted in this idea that drastically different types of people want to live together. Current events are of course proving that at the slightest disagreement this mirage collapses and people have a need to surround themselves with like minded people. The irreconcilable differences in this country are going to lead to a Balkanization in my opinion.</p>
