    <strong>I hate virtual learning.</strong>
    <p><p>No I am not a college student. I am a single mom with a six year old who is in the first grade. Virtual learning for kids 4-8 is about the dumbest thing imaginable (in my state PK starts at 4 and yes they were still trying to encourage parents to enroll their pre-K students this year).</p>
<p>Everybody knows that school at this age is mostly just for kids social development but they also learn some fundamentals (letter sounds, beginning to write, counting, etc.). The fact that they want my first grader to “learn” online without a teacher there to coach him is ridiculous. I’m so fed up with the system I feel like I’m going to have a breakdown. Its only day two of online learning but how can they keep this up for nine more weeks+? I’m lucky that my job was able to give me the time off to figure out this shit but I can’t just quit my job to stay home and teach him. Thats what public school was for! Now I have to hire a babysitter to supervise his online learning. Its so ridiculous. And other parents just seem to be ok with it. They say “yea it sucks but we have to deal with it for now” or “this is the new normal”. It drives me crazy.</p>
<p>I’m not getting reimbursed daycare costs for this. I can’t get unemployment for this. I can’t quit my job for this. What are us single parents supposed to do? Just roll over and take it? There is no one sticking up for us. Anybody who is pro-keeping public schools closed is officially my enemy.</p></p>

        <p>So the online is live? You may have other options. Contact the department of curriculum and instruction of your district and ask if you could have an ASYNCHRONOUS online option so you can assist your first grader at YOUR CONVENIENCE. Here is a virtual big hug from a retired teacher who knows all the school BS. Go right over the counselor's head because the counselor has too much skin in the game. C and I will be shocked at first but they get gold stars for reaching out to parents in tough situations.</p>

        <p>I teach college students (who are actually a lot like kids 4-8 in many ways lol) and they seem to have been temporarily disabled from last semesters Zoom experiment. They don’t socialize, chat with me after class, laugh, or ask questions anymore. I brought it up with them today and reiterated the importance of human interaction. I told them I could still tell when they were smiling behind their masks and a lot of them smiled at that and it damn near broke my heart. 
We are all craving this connection because it is what allows us to witness humanity and builds empathy for others. I am terrified of what will happen if baseless restrictions continue. 
And while I don’t have biological children, I deeply feel for you and your child. I’m so sorry you didn’t have a choice in this and that no one consulted parents as to what they wanted or needed.</p>

        <p>We'll give money to twenty year olds to sit around unemployed for months, but not to single moms who HAD childcare figured out until all these dumb rules came into effect.</p>
<p>Frustrated right there with you! It's super lame that you're in this position, and don't worry there's a ton of us who support you!</p>
