    <strong>At least we never believed in "bat soup"...</strong>
    <p><p>"iT cAmE fRoM a wEt MaRkET!!!" Sounds like the title of a shitty 1950s sci-fi monster B-movie.</p>
<p>If you fucking lurking idiots believed and swallowed that load of deep-fried dog-dick could you not conceivably be wrong about everything else too? BAT SOUP! C'mon. Seriously?</p>
<p>Also: no one here has EVER brought up 5G or microchips in the vaccine as a reason they're not getting vaccinated. You believe that shit too and post unfunny jokes after getting your Fauci ouchie (i gOt mY mIcRoSofT uPgRaDe duR huR!) based on a strawman that the media has conjured up in an effort to make us (and you by extension for buying into it) look stupid.</p>
<p>But perhaps the stupidest and most glaring conspiracy theory you swear by is that the government and media really do give a single solitary fuck about you! I'm sure every politician's and media hack's first thought in the morning is: "gee whiz, I sure do wish this heckin virus would stop killing people!" THEY ARE FUCKING LAUGHING THEIR ASSES OFF AT YOU! All the way to the fucking bank!</p>
<p>Time to come out of your fucking coma and WAKE THE FUCK UP!</p></p>

        <p>Yep. My “libertarian,” friend who married a hard liberal and now posts Greta Thunberg shit always brings up the microchips and nanoparticles.</p>
<p>My counter was to show him the DARPA article proving they do exist and say, “you will get the microchip before I will.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit I won’t get that.”</p>
<p>“You got the vaccine.”</p>
<p>“My wife’s doctor told me to get it because she is pregnant.”</p>
<p>“All it’s going to take is your wife’s doctor to say you need to be monitored by a microchip for your baby’s safety.”</p>
<p>“Fuck you.”</p>

        <p>Hardly anyone in the government cares if you live or die.</p>
<p>Almost everyone in the government judges their decisions on two criteria.</p>
<p>1) Which choice increases my odds of getting reelected?
2) Which choice increases tax revenue?</p>
<p>If 1% of us dying from an untested vaccine for a disease that 99% of us survive makes the economy go again, pleasing (the surviving) voters and increasing tax intake, they are happy.</p>
