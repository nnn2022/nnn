    <strong>I feel like giving up on my life and stopping eating.</strong>
    <p><p>I have lost weight already from poor appetite during lockdown. I was already skinny. I want to lie in bed and sleep forever. I can't take any more bullshit from the government, people, and media. I don't want to live in a country I cannot leave or enter without a vaccine passport. I don't want to be forced to be vaccinated. I want to dream forever. I can hardly believe any of this happened or is even real. Sometimes I feel like I am living in a dream and that this is all fake. I don't know what to do with my life. I have no friends anymore. I feel so alone. I don't go out anymore. I waste my time online in a chair all day not eating, surviving off coffee, nicotine, and weed. I don't even know where to start. I don't know what to do with my life. I wish I could travel back to the 2000's when I was a child who knew no better and lived in ignorant bliss.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah this is a shit situation man and I hate it just as much as everyone else. But whether you want to hear this or not, you need to take some personal responsibility and get out of your bad habits. Nobody else is going to help you. Get out, meet people, socialise. As a species all we really are wired to do is eat, have sex, sleep and socialise. You cut one of those out you’re in trouble. I know it’s tough, but take the plunge and get round other people, you will feel so much better.</p>

        <p>You may want to speak to a counselor or therapist. I've been going to one. Started about 3 months ago. There's an online therapist I see. They work with a company you may have heard of if you listen to podcasts. She has help me alot. I always thought counseling and therapy was for crazy people, but after 15 months of this shit and with no one to really talk to, I decided to give it a chance. It's been well worth the money spent on it...  they offer financial aid if you need it</p>

Don't give in, they want  your to despair. Try to get joy from the simple things in life. Enjoy the warm sun on your skin, enjoy a good cold drink on a warm summer day. Laugh, live, love.   </p>

<p>I dont care if you've never lifted a dumbbell in your life, today is the day. Get off your ass and go lift some heavy shit.</p>
<p>Yes, these times suck and it will probably get worse before it gets better, but sitting around and sulking is not an option.</p>
<p>Go hit the gym, planet fitness has free 1 day trials and only costs $10/mo, go increase your endorphins and get moving, <em>quitting is not an option.</em></p>
<p>I'll DM you in 2 hours to make sure you went. You'll be glad you did.</p>

        <p>Hey dude ( or dudette), we are living in a crazy time thats for sure, but we gotta keep pushing through. I believe we will be the light to this world. Try to not spend to much time focusing on social media, I find in can only spend so much time even on NNN as it can start to get me down as well. Try to get outside and maybe see if you can pick up a hobby. I started skateboarding at 37 and am having a freaking blast even though I am out skated by every 5 year old at the park. But getting a good sweat on and getting some vitamin D has been really beneficial for me.  You obviously can see through the fog of this whole covid thing so you are a critical part of our NNN family. Take care! </p>
<p>PS... do people on Reddit say ps? Lol... I'm so old..</p>
<p>I am a Christian and I can tell you that my faith is a huge part of finding light in this wild world for me. If you want to talk about God or faith, feel free to reach out.</p>

        <p>If you do that then you’re letting them win. Don’t ever give up the good fight. Find some hobbies that make you happy and stop stressing about it all, when it comes down to it there’s not much we can do to alter the situation so you can either let it destroy your mental health or just decide to not let it get to you. Turn off the news and go for a walk, talk to someone, play a game you enjoy, etc. I’ve been right where you are, I know it’s tough but you gotta find some light somewhere and it’ll be alright!</p>

        <p>when faced with adversity, you have 2 choices, be depressed, or be angry.</p>
<p>be angry.</p>
<p>being depressed is the loser way, it's the socialist way, it's the beta male way, it's the low IQ way, it's the democrat voters way, it's the NPC way.</p>
<p>be angry.</p>
<p>brainstorm a list of thing you can do today to improve your life (not the world, not your country, YOUR life).</p>
<p>then use the anger as motivation to compulsively work towards that thing.</p>
<p>anger is the greatest motivator. it hunts you, it consumes you, all day, everyday, 24/7, it allows you to work more than you ever thought you could.</p>
<p>if your life is OK, and there's nothing about it that makes you angry, then you can move on to actually try to improve the world.</p>
<p>think about what makes you angry in the world.</p>

        <p>Hey where are you at? If you’re in southern Ontario I’ll be your friend. I’m in the same position too... surviving off nicotine, weed and meds... I haven’t socialized normally in what feels like years</p>
<p>Lost most of my friends as well... but I have been making some new connections thankfully </p>
<p>I have American citizenship though.. I’ll most likely try to leave  this place when I can and head to Florida..</p>

        <p>Life can and often times sucks, many times you will find yourself wondering what the actual fuck is the purpose of this charade, why this endless perpetual loop of negative thoughts that go round and a around, squashed only momentarily through a hit or a drink, suffering with depression or anxiety can feel like a future hope is a mute pointless endeavor, I know, Ive gone through this many a time in life, and now with all this covid shit those thoughts can get worse, So I try to occupy myself with other things, I try to be optimistic, but sometimes the clouds come back, I know this isn't the most inspiring comment, but I just want you to know you really are not alone, and the thing that has been slowly helping me is to just take care of myself, please start eating, that alone can truly make a difference in your brain chemistry, try to be physical, if smoking weed helps you cope then keep on it, but I advise a slow withdraw from it, sometimes that shit escalates depression, (I know this from personal experience) and a little hope won't kill you, just because your brain tells you all is meaningless, doesn't make your brain right, live for that better day and try to find the least damaging coping skills to deal with the dark days, and don't forget, most people in the world are pretty cool, its just hard to see when your mind is in that zone, but they are there, trust me.</p>

<p>Come gather ’round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You’ll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin’
Then you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin’</p>
<p>Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won’t come again
And don’t speak too soon
For the wheel’s still in spin
And there’s no tellin’ who that it’s namin’
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin’</p>
<p>Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don’t stand in the doorway
Don’t block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There’s a battle outside and it is ragin’
It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin’</p>
<p>Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don’t criticize
What you can’t understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin’
Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin’</p>
<p>The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin’
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin’</p>

        <p>I sometimes feel the same way, they said my whole life was ahead of me, then a dead stop. I’m lost now, don’t know what to do, was thinking about college but I’ll never be accepted now. I don’t fit their narrative or identity. Right now I’m researching crypto currencies, maybe make something out of that. It doesn’t help everyone around me either completely buys into the mainstream narrative or they’re just willfully ignorant and “will just get the vaccine if they can go <em>back to normal</em>”. I’m becoming a loser and it’s out of my control. Especially living in an authoritarian fascist country that’s going mad with the restrictions.</p>

        <p>I would imagine this is what war feels like. The good news is that everything comes to an end. It's a tough situation at the moment for those awake enough to see through all of the BS. However, in the end, this will pass like everything else.</p>

        <p>I was in a very similar state not long ago. On advice from my father, here are some things I did to alleviate that awful feeling of being a rat trapped in a cage:</p>
<p>Stop smoking. Weed and cigarettes. Just don’t buy them. The craving will wear off. It’s a conscious decision to procure these things. It’s a conscious decision to not do it any more. Don’t replace these things with alcohol either. </p>
<p>Exercise. Anything will do. Walk around the neighborhood. Make eye contact and smile (important) at strangers. Even if you get ignored or get a negative response, you’re putting your own energy out there. Trust me on this. Try it and you’ll agree. You may even have some pleasant little chats along the way. Talk about the weather. Compliment someone’s dog. It all helps you condition yourself into positivity and socialization. Try it and you will see. Keep trying until you feel connected. I guarantee you will.</p>
<p>I now go out each day and workout in the local park. Just simple body weight resistance movements, followed by a few laps of the park and a nice long stretch. Get some good tunes in your ears and come up with a goal to work towards. Focus on that while you’re outside. </p>
<p>Getting some fresh air and sun helps too :)</p>
<p>We’ll most likely never meet. We’ll never really know each other. But you and I, we are in this together. </p>
<p>If you want to update me on how it’s all going, my inbox is open.</p>
