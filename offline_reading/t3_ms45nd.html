    <strong>Australian PM now wants covid passports</strong>
    <p><p>Scott Morrison has said he is looking at covid passports in a way to get the country open again but warned there could be a 1000 cases a week.  Curiously he met with the national cabinet before deciding all of this.  This is dangerous and needs to be stopped.  He is fear mongering and I for one wont have a covid passport. </p>

        <p>UK yesterday in BBC says there is now a Indian ‘variant’ detected from samples taken in February.</p>
<p>Also a headline I saw Wednesday (didn’t research, might be fake news, but sounds like it should be what’s coming) that Astro V vaccines will require a 6month on going jab to maintain immunity.</p>
<p>Whatever you have to say about Covid and vaccines. Stand that aside. And see this coincidence...</p>
<p>UK have killed it on delivery, should be a model of how  to roll out a vaccine. (Clap, clap UK bros)</p>
<p>The UK is head of the Commonwealth, and is head of Schwab’s plans. Boris was first to be stamped with ‘Build back better’ Schwab cumshot when he spoke.</p>
<p>Only news I’m seeing or hearing regarding worries on vaccines comes from US media I search for. Last weeks mass coverage from media has been focused on Phillip dying. He’s been on the verge for weeks/months. Funeral today. </p>
<p>It’d be no surprise next week that there is a new alarming variant of mass flu that holds the news for a week. </p>
<p>Stops all talk and worry about other issues... </p>
<p>Last week, Boris has only spoken once in person. Trump was daily, I love that guy! Boris only spoke regarding Covid, how great UK and NHS are doing and the royal dying. </p>
<p>Boris in his speech to the UK Totally avoided the fact that a capital city of the UK(Belfast) had been on fire for 4 nights, and riots against Police were the issue - not looting, burning down of whole communities. </p>
<p>(key detail, N/Ireland is how to riot. Molotov police, not Footlocker and Walgreens, family run/small businesses. White guys riots respect communities, and attack authorities/enemy. Even if enemy runs a shop, it won’t as a rule be destroyed. </p>
<p>The White guy’s Molotov aim is always at authority, not at a local Bodega)</p>
<p>Trudeau, Morrison also destroying their countries as we speak. Weeks behind Boris.</p>
<p>Fuck knows what South Africa is up to, last I checked they were busy killing white farmers for land that they think they own because ‘muh bleek’. Well actually, Mandela was a terrorist, where trying to kick on and build a society, and you invaded us anyway...</p>
<p>.and breath. /rant/</p>

        <p>Pfizer CEO says they need a third injection now.. It will never end.  Much like ignorance.  It will never ever end.  The vaccine provided NO immunity nor stops the spread so why keep subjecting oneself to an injection?  Stupidity.</p>
<p>Australia isn't far behind..</p>
