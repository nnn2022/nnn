    <strong>Really starting to lose hope</strong>
    <p><p>I hate to say this but after this bullshit ‘mutation’ news has broken and seeing the genuine reaction of the public I’m just about ready to clock out. I really thought people were starting to wake up and now any hope I had left is gone. 
I wish we could make something good out of all of this - hold politicians actually accountable, defund major news agencies and create regulations where INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM is actually a thing again instead of drilling out unverified and non peer reviewed medical declarations. Fund hospitals <em>better</em> so they can’t use the ‘overcrowded’ excuse when they’ve been overcrowded for decades. </p>
<p>I just don’t see any light at the end of this tunnel. I think whoever the hell is behind this simply won’t give up until they’ve got what they want and they’re basically there already. I hate to say it, but I don’t think we’re getting out of this. I really hope I’m wrong but after what we’ve seen over this year, we know now how incredibly and stupidly easy it is to turn people on each other and be so riddled with fear they throw all rationality out the window. All hail the mighty news outlets, big pharma and ‘Dr’ Gates. </p>
<p>I just need someone to tell me I’m being way too pessimistic here, but I think I’m being realistic.</p></p>

        <p>The divisions created in America are already set in stone at this point.  This is decades in the making and this year was just the final nail in the coffin.  Our elite ruling class has us just where they want us: fighting amongst ourselves and blaming each other for what's going on.  They are enjoying it.  They don't have to follow their own mandates, and they will get off scot free.  We will never unite and realize who the real enemy is.  There is no end to this that doesn't involve a fascistic, totalitarian government and a technocratic dystopia.</p>

        <p>I just spoke to my sis in England. I live in California. We got into a huge fight and she called me a Trump supporter, which she knows is absolutely not true. This was because I told her I am anti lockdown, which she already knows, and that there are lots  of scientists who also are against the lockdown. She would  not listen and wouldn’t even consider that it might be true. I hung up on her.</p>

        <p>Ugh I’m sorry, that’s really shit especially when it’s family. The amount of scientists and doctors that are speaking out about this still don’t seem to be good enough for pro-lockdown folk. That’s not the science <em>they</em> want to trust. Which just goes to show it’s not about science at all.</p>

        <p>My sister is a smart chick. All this behaving by her, and blindly following all the government hysteria is taking a toll on me. I have no family here in the US. So my sis is important to me. I feel sick to my stomach but calling me a Trump supporter pushed me over the edge. I mean she absolutely knows that’s not true. I can’t stand the man, never have. I am as we speak listening to this interesting PhD boffin type scientist talk  about the virus and the lockdowns in the UK. I know she won’t even watch the YouTube vid if I send it to her. I feel so empty.</p>

        <p>The more and more you express yourself as an individual, people will associate you with Trump. If you speak in defense of free speech and thought, the answer? Trump. </p>
<p>Well, who does he stand for? A whole lot of people who support the 1st and 2nd amendment. It’s not trump people hate, it’s the individual that is not governed by them. And they’ll never admit it.</p>

        <p>I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.</p>
<p>Frank Herbert, [Dune ]</p>
<p>It might be a bullshit quote from a scifi novel but it seems pertinent.  Did you give up hope during the multitudinous bullshit wars? The war on drugs, the war on terror, war on crime, the weapons of mass destruction, the continual cycle of boom and bust. The genocides and atrocities. 
This war on a virus is just another fear ladled onto the masses.  The world we grew up in has always had fear used as a tool against us. Another quote but this time the matrix </p>
<p>"[Morpheus ] The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it."</p>
<p>We cant force people to come out of their matrix or postage stamp reality as David Icke might put it. The real question is how to free your own mind. 
Sages and mystics have been wrestling with this issue for eternity. Save yourself first. </p>
<p>There is a concept in buddhism called the bodhisatva vow. The idea is that after enlightenment  one promises to come back to help others also escape the trap of karmic debt.  But one has to become free first or we risk making the situation worse with our ignorance. </p>
<p>It may well be that we are so caught up, like in a spider's web, with so many strands of cultured dogmatic propaganda that there "seems" to be no hope. But hope is the flip side of fear. They are the two faces of the same coin. </p>
<p>This system is so embedded with flaws that it would be a miracle to be without hope that it might turn out ok, married with fear that it will all fail. </p>
<p>The less we need the system, the less hope and fear it can instill within you.</p>

        <p>You're being way too pessimistic. The majority don't really matter: rain or shine, lockdown or no lockdown, they won't do a damn thing except bleat in accordance with the wind. The tug-of-war is solely between the critics and enthusiastic collaborators: there are more of us each day, and less of them.</p>
<p>In addition, the power-hungry can never get what they want. They need us to have it, and it only enslaves them to their worst fantasies. They'll never have enough, never be satisfied, never rest. Nor do they know in advance how people will react. They are so far removed from ordinary life they can only try to predict popular behaviour by big data. But popular behaviour does not run on data. It runs on zeitgeist. They can't quantify that. They don't know what's going to happen any more than we do.</p>

        <p>I really hope you’re right. I am praying that they overstep just once, and everything will come crashing down. But man I miss the little things. I miss being able to smile at someone walking past or sitting in a cafe or bar with my friends, even going to the cinema. Even if I take no heed of the lockdowns I have nowhere to go, no one to talk to. 
These elites will not give up until something scares them to their core but they’re just having the best time seeing how compliant everyone is. I guess you’re right in that each day there are more of us and less of them, but in all honestly I’m just impatient at this point. I have a life to live and this isn’t living.</p>

<p>That's really all it takes. A spontaneous popular uprising is the universal fear of all authoritarian regimes. It's not guerrilla warfare (they can fight those). It's not dissidents (those can be locked up). It's another Tahrir Square moment, when the police go: "no, sorry, we can see the nonsense too, we aren't dispersing them." Game over.</p>

        <p>God I hope you’re right. I know it’s easy to think that what you see online is what the general population thinks and it’s hard to get myself out of that mindset, but I’d say people are gonna be straight up hypochondriacs from here on out. It just seems to be spiralling into more and more chaos and there’s no way out. But it doesn’t hurt to stay hopeful.</p>

        <p>I will! Yeah it seems like a truly daunting situation. I really do think that the average person is starting to question though, at least. How the gov isn’t helping people for this long is a real wake up call for some. </p>
<p>I’ve been having some surprising conversations lately too—people who I would have bet money on being pro lockdown are actually skeptical, or at least willing to genuinely listen. I also think at this point there is some common ground with the doomers who believe that there has to be a smarter way to go about this, and that ruining people’s lives is simply not worth it. </p>
<p>We’ll get there. This won’t stand forever. I believe in human spirit</p>
