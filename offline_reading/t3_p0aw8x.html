        <p>Right now the US government is threatening to breakup Big Tech.</p>
<p>As a consequence Big Tech is censoring content that the US Government doesn’t want public; deplatforming and demonetizing people the US Government doesn’t want generating content; and now this move by Apple to curry favor.</p>
<p>As you point out these maneuvers always start out with some claimed beneficent goal and slowly devolve into all sorts of shady shit.</p>

<p>nonsense. at best if they ever do it it would be for show.</p>
<p>the big tech companies and governments are all one unit. one kakistocracy.</p>
<p>apple is part of the prism program for example.</p>
<p>microsoft has more government backdoors than cheese has holes and now official spies on everything you do.</p>
<p>stop seeing those mega tech corporations and traitor government as 2 different entities.</p>
<p>they are NOT. it is one unit.</p>
<p>the idea of  private tech giants is a strategic move.</p>
<p>the public likely wouldn't accept government creating a network for them to share all their information on, BUT facebook is WRONGFULLY seen as a private company so they got away with it.</p>

        <p>I am not arguing they are in bed with each other.</p>
<p>My point is that the DOJ and state AG’s have brought antitrust cases against them and there’s current antitrust legislation before Congress.</p>
<p>Essentially it’s like a mafia shakedown.  Basically whatever was left of independent behavior within Big Tech management when it comes to government will be handed over to make the antitrust bogeyman go bye bye.</p>
<p>They did something similar to the hedge fund industry threatening legislation to treat carried interest as regular income.</p>
<p>Once the hedge funds starting making heavy donations to the Democrats that legislation got shelved.</p>

        <p>Hey! </p>
<p>As far as android goes, your best bet is either GrapheneOS or CalyxOS paired with a Pixel. I would first try GrapheneOS, as it’s more secure. The only downside is that it lacks a replacement for google services. If GrapheneOS is too inconvenient, you can switch to CalyxOS. CalyxOS is a fork of GrapheneOS that sacrifices a little security for convenience. </p>
<p>If you need any help with switching or just want to improve your privacy, feel free to DM me. I can help you out.</p>

        <p>it is important to be aware here, that this is designed right from the start to be all about spying and censoring.</p>
<p>as with all their agendas they start with something , that is relatively small and with a topic, that is indefensible like child porn.</p>
<p>this then gradually gets expanded over time until they achieve their end goal, which WAS ALWAYS PLANNED TO BE THE FINAL RESULT right from the start.</p>
<p>to name an example, that most here should be aware of.</p>
<p>as youtube started to censor content, remove whole videos and ban full creators, they  started with the person, that they would most likely get agreeance on from the public, which was alex jones and they then gradually expended to the point of today, where any content or channel going against the current agenda gets banned and propaganda is written below videos against the creators will on the videos, that are still left.</p>
<p>they couldn't have done it in one step, because that would have resulted in a massive push back.</p>
<p>gradualism is one of the key parts in implementing the agendas of the kakistocracy.</p>
<p>so yes the title  on this post is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>this is a stepping stone. it will get expended by the pedophile kakistocracy far and wide in the near future to check for everything. probably also linked with a social crediting system.</p>
<p>and this is important to understand here too.</p>
<p>the ones ultimately behind this are pedophile mass murderers.</p>
<p>jefrey epstein ran a pedophile island, that was setup to gain control of high ranking people including top politicians.</p>
<p>and he also was great friends with bill, i am paralyzing half a million children in india and murdering another set elsewhere, gates.</p>
<p>so it is LAUGHABLE, that the massmurdering, pedophile kakistocracy is talking about "saving the children" by supposedly trying to track down already existing pedophile pictures on people's content.</p>
<p>again THEY are the pedophiles. they are running most of the child trafficking networks.</p>
<p>and the terrorists in uniform are also involved of course.</p>
<p>the australian police refuses to investigate the most likely place, where the bodies of the missing beaumont children are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/missing-beaumont-children-sapol-to-dig-the-sink-hole-at-mcintyre-road-stansbury">https://www.change.org/p/missing-beaumont-children-sapol-to-dig-the-sink-hole-at-mcintyre-road-stansbury</a></p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>and why  are there suppressions orders setup to protect 28 high ranking pedophiles by the australian government?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_gEY7wlGlw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_gEY7wlGlw</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/scott-morrison-make-the-names-known-28-pedophiles-in-australian-leadership">https://www.change.org/p/scott-morrison-make-the-names-known-28-pedophiles-in-australian-leadership</a></p>
<p>they are pure evil monsters and hope, that the average person is dumb enough to fall for the "think about the children" lie, while they are traficking children and raping and abusing them behind closed doors."</p>
<p>what can you do?</p>
<p>THROW AWAY YOUR SMART PHONE.</p>
<p>it is a spying device and it is designed to be one.</p>
<p>at bare minimum reduce using it to the bare minimum you "need" for your job and nothing else as a start.</p>

        <p>With the approach they’re using (hashing tech) it will take less a second per photo, probably less than a tenth of a second per photo. And it will be done locally on your phone,  so it’ll use your phones own processing power, meaning that it’ll happen on everyone’s iPhone, across the world, all at once. I’ll likely never buy another iPhone because of this.</p>

        <p>Man I have no social media, I don’t listen to any news, me and my boyfriend own our own small business, and I feel like I have so little communication with the outside world (in a GOOD way-I love it). My guilty pleasure is my phone. I am a hyper organized person and I love my apps and widgets, it makes my life SO much easier. We literally can’t just have ONE FUCKING THING in this country. It is a bombardment on all fronts. Does anyone know of a way to make an iPhone basically unhooked from being traced?</p>
