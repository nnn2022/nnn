    <strong>If you would not force/coerce a woman into getting an abortion, you should not force/coerce me into getting a vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>Why the hell do people feel comfortable telling others what to do with their body?</p>
<p>I have religious beliefs that preclude me from taking the vaccine, wearing a mask, or otherwise being complicit to the New Normal. Why should anyone feel like they have control over what I do?</p>
<p>For all of my life, I have heard from the media that bodily autonomy and religious freedom are sacred.</p>
<p>It was drilled into our brains from a young age that women have a "right to choose" and "control over their bodies." </p>
<p>Despite the fact that abortion intentionally and unnaturally ends a human life (no, it is not murder, but it is still the ending of a life,) it is praised by the media. </p>
<p>However, there is no guarantee that going around as you always have before the pandemic started will harm anyone in the slightest. </p>
<p>Nobody can prove whether or not you are even sick, they cannot prove how much you transmit to others if you were, they cannot prove that harm occurred as a result of you transmitting it, and they absolutely cannot say you had intent to harm others if you were to spread it unknowingly. </p>
<p>Yet one is celebrated as "freedom" and "bodily autonomy," and the other is demonized as "mass murder?" Does nobody else see anything "off" here?</p>
<p>As children in school, we were taught that the religious beliefs of others (that are in opposition to our own cultural values) must be respected, and those who follow such a religion must be permitted to do so without hindrance (even if some of their beliefs and practices pose a threat to our safety.)</p>
<p>No matter how foreign various non-Christian/Western religions and cultures appear to us, we were required to tolerate them and make accommodations for believers that often afforded them special privileges and exemptions from rules that we did not receive. </p>
<p>Now that the belief and value systems under fire are identified with conservatives, nobody cares to protect these natural rights anymore.</p>
<p>The liberal-dominated media is not writing human interest stories about folks like us who have lost employment opportunities or faced legal repercussions due to refusing the vaccine/masks/other measures. </p>
<p>They are not writing sob stories about individuals who are forced to choose between their most sincerely-held religious beliefs and putting food on the table for their family, unless it involves a group that liberals identify with.</p>
<p>What do you think CNN would have to say about an employer that felt they had a say in whether or not a Muslim woman wore certain articles of clothing, or a government that was removing womens' right to an abortion? </p>
<p>If you were wondering, here are some answers.</p>

<p>https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/01/europe/abortion-rights-poland-us-slovakia-intl/index.html</p>
<p>It would seem that the media has never truly cared about bodily autonomy or religious tolerance, but rather about portraying conservatives in a negative light. </p>
<p>Now that bodily autonomy and adherence to religious beliefs that don't comply with cultural norms are no longer primarily liberal-identity issues, the media demonizes them.</p>
<p>Where are the liberal institutions coming to my defense now that there is an assault on my bodily autonomy and the freedom to live in compliance with my most sincerely-held religious beliefs?</p>
<p>Or do those freedoms only apply to individuals, cultures, and religions that are perceived to be in opposition to conservative values?</p>
<p>This whole thing is a load of crap.</p></p>
