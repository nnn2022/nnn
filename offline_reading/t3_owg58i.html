        <p>I've been banned from subs for being a part of other subs before but never to this extent. I'm looking at a list of at least 50 subs that have banned me for participation here.</p>
<p>But that got me thinking.</p>
<p>If this subreddit was only "spreading misinformation," it wouldn't have made it very far from the start.</p>
<p>And when all the bans came, i was a little baffled at first, but this strikes me as a sign that something we're doing is right.</p>
<p>If they're trying to silence us everywhere, it means they know we have power and are trying to oppress that. 100,000 people agree that we have a problem with what's currently happening and if that doesn't scream "HELLOOO SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT HERE" then idk what will.</p>
<p>Everyone i've spoken to in this sub has been level headed and rational. People here aren't trying to force their views on anyone else or wish death upon those who disagree with them. We came here for a safe place to discuss the authoritarian actions taken by governments during this pandemic and how we don't want them to become the NEW NORMAL.</p>
<p>And yet, we're being punished for even existing. For having these views that oppose a majority, we're branded as psychotic criminals with malicious intent.</p>
<p>For those who continue to post and comment despite being shunned by all the rest of reddit, good for you. Hold your ground.</p>
<p>Be civil. Discuss and debate. And don't let them scare you into silence.</p>

        <p>I was posting regularly on the_Donald for nearly it's entire run. At no point did they try this hard to silence us. They wanted to ban the sub, but there wasn't a widespread effort to silence individual members. This is new. You don't get this kind of effort without some money behind it. And there is definitely billions on the line with these vaccines. Someone really doesn't want this spreading.</p>

<p>How do you reckon? The flat earth thing has gone on only to get stronger in the face of mountains of evidence. People like to think they found some hidden secret that the masses were blind to, it's childish. This place is no different. People are dying and you guys post pics of people laughing at others wearing "chin diapers" and examine how to mock those who simply wear a mask. How is that civil discussion? How is that even rational?</p>

        <p>I can't speak for everyone. But a majority here are like myself, people who just want to live and let live. I can understand the frustration by the people on this sub though. And the memes, too. Probably backlash for constantly being ridiculed for the way they choose to live. Which i feel is unnecessary on both sides. I don't believe in fighting fire with fire but like i said, i can't speak for everyone and i don't control anyone else so they can do what they feel like.</p>
<p>As for the misinformation thing, you kinda have a point that it could definitely progress while lying to everyone. I mean, just look at governments lmfao. Biggest liars in the world and most people take their word at face value, big HA there.</p>
<p>Anyway, i've had alot more rational conversations here than on other subs that just follow every law and rule without a second thought. I'd rather be able to think for myself and choose what's best for myself on my own, whether it contradicts facts/statistics or not.</p>
<p>Everyone is not the same so to apply cookie cutter solutions to the masses will definitely result in the harm or death of a few. I'd rather take my chances with the virus than anything else. But for that choice, i'm a heathen. </p>
<p>So here i am.</p>

        <p>Seriously. If you think about and question everything, you start to realize that nothing people in charge say makes sense. If you question that, you get labeled as a loon or conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>It's outrageous how many people live without questioning anything and like you said, just echo their biased view and shun those who disagree.</p>

        <p>Reddit doesn't usually ban except for stuff that's highly illegal (drug sales, threats, yadda yadda). This is happening at the discretion of a few mods with reach across multiple communities.</p>
<p>I even went through the trouble of seeing if they are breaching any rules by banning for no reason (which they are not) and a few lower mods feel the same way. </p>
<p>They're seeing countless people banned from their subs with modmail of all the replies while they are unable to do anything about it.</p>
<p>On one post, a mod said he was banned for interfering with the banning. I don't see a near end to this issue. You have a serious abuse in power when even some of the people in power can't speak out against the oppression.</p>

        <p>Same here. I found out about a few subs by getting banned from them. That's really crazy to me. That they're banning people not only from subs they participate in or post their views in but from EVERYWHERE, regardless of your contribution (or lack of) to that sub, even if you never posted about NNN or its topics there.</p>
<p>It's fishy to say the least.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that is supposedly against Reddit rules, because we are getting brigaded by subs. Even if we were part of the communities, they are not supposed to coordinate banning and messaging us, that's harassment, in addition to brigading. So Reddit lost my subscription and my monetary contribution, lmfao!</p>

        <p>I've been banned from 10 subs or so that I know, and I say that because I didn't get any notification.</p>
<p>I only realize I'm banned because when I click on a topic on mobile it says explicitly you are banned from posting and on desktop the field to write is not there.</p>
<p>So I don't know how many subs I'm banned from.</p>
