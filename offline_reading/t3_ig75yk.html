        <p>I havent had an income since March.  I thought others were in the same boat.  Financially devastated.  But more and more, I am reading that I am alone in this.  Everyone else is doing just fine.  I thought once other people started losing everything, things would change.</p>
<p>I am wrong.  I just got crushed and no one else is really going to lose anything at all.  </p>
<p>So for the very few who are financially devastated reopening matters.  I donâ€™t understand any of this at all.</p>

        <p>The stock market isn't really booming. It's that the government has injected massive stimulus into the economy which causes inflation. Everyone's money is now worth less. But stocks go up in value, not because they are suddenly worth more, but because the value of the dollar has dropped. You actually need more money now to buy the same stock because our currency has decreased in value, but there is much more of it in circulation.</p>
<p>It's important to keep in mind that the stock market doesn't reflect the true economy. It's based mostly on speculation - the future. People really are struggling right now, but they also realize that when the government injects new money into the economy, people need save havens to place their money so it doesn't decrease in value. So they turn to stocks, gold, real estate, cryptocurrency etc.</p>
