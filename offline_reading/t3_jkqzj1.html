    <strong>An open dialogue on fighting a pandemic</strong>
    <p><p>I like to hear what both sides have to say. I’ve been to r/coronavirus, but I spend much more time on r/COVID19. After browsing this subreddit, I get the general consensus that masks (especially non-medical ones) should not be required and lockdowns should not be in place. Outside of those two, are there any other areas you think effort <em>should</em> be placed in re: trying to decrease the spread/fatality of the pandemic? Some examples could be: isolating the elderly/high risk, making high capacity/packed places less packed, shortening lengths of time in a closed tight space, etc. Or, you can say, “I don’t think anything should be recommended or focused on”. Anything goes, I want to learn more about what actions should be taken, if any at all, from your perspective.</p></p>

        <p>Determine at what cycle the PCR test is detecting actual live virus that could infect someone and stop running it at higher cycles ever or anywhere.  Stop including "presumed" cases and even worse "presumed deaths" in the counts - go back and do an audit of every single covid death and determine which of them actually involved the virus as a meaningful contributing factor vs. those that didn't.</p>
<p>STOP trying to terrify people.  STOP trying to distort people's perception of their own risk.  Focus on helping the people who are actually at risk.  Stop using metrics for re-opening that make no sense and create a variety of catch-22 situations.  Make restrictions as minimal as possible - focus on identifying the ones that actually have the most meaningful effect and that are the most sustainable.</p>
<p>Say thank you.  Say I'm sorry.  Say we understand that this can not go on indefinitely.  Do things that establish trust if that is even still possible (unfortunately I sort of doubt it).  Make efforts to show you are considering multiple viewpoints on the appropriate action to take.  Try to work with the opposing party where possible to de-politicize this virus.  Be willing to sacrifice your political future for the greater good.  Stop listening to blue-checks from twitter.  Stop talking about "lives" vs. "the economy" as if they have nothing to do with each other.  Say thank you.  Say I'm sorry.  Move heaven and earth to get kids who want to be in school back in school.  Say thank you.  Say I'm sorry.  Show that you understand why people are angry.  Stop treating human beings like machines with an on/off switch.  Show that you want to keep society as open as possible, as was always the default in public health.  Show that you are not just listening to the loudest voices but for the voices that have no way to speak or that have tried and been drowned out.</p>
<p>Fight the virus, not your citizens.</p>

        <p>MSM means "mainstream media".  The problem is that some people consider everything to be mainstream media while some consider CNN to be mainstream while considering Fox News not to be, despite the fact that it's watched by millions of people.  Those who consider everything to be mainstream are, unfortunately, likely using Facebook and other questionable sites for their news (infowars is a major offender).  If someone says ignore MSM, they may be steering you in a good direction but be as dilligent in reviewing their sources as you would anyone else.  Make sure the math checks out and that the claims can be sourced and verified.</p>
<p>Basically, this means that the only way you can truly ignore MSM is to seek out, read and interpret actual data from reputable journals and peer reviewed papers.</p>
<p>Hint: biorxiv is not a good source no matter which side of this debate you're on.  It's a preprint repository meaning that all papers available there have not gone through peer review and even though they look pretty and official, they can be written and uploaded by anyone.</p>

        <p>Shift funding to protect the vulnerable in nursing homes or keep them paid to stay home from work. Everyone else carries on as normal. Stop counting cases and obsessing over cases. Accept that deaths of the elderly and sick are a fact of life, and people die every day and face risks leaving their homes every day. Consider that the futures of children and young people are in fact more important than the life of someone who has already lived a full life. Encourage people to take personal responsibility for their health and lose weight and we could add many years to life expectancy and improve quality of life. Admit that sacrificing quality of life just for the sake of being alive isn’t worth it.</p>

        <p>I really take issue with this "isolate the elderly" idea.  Who's to say the elderly <em>want</em> to be isolated?  If you're 85 years old you're obviously aware of the fact that any year has a good chance of being your last.  Do you want to spend that last year in isolation?  Not seeing your kids but through a window?  And even then, only for a half hour at a time?  That seems cruel and inhumane to me.</p>
<p>Honestly, this sounds harsh, but I think it's pretty naive of humans to think we can actually do something to stop this.  Look at graphs all over the world and for every example where it looks like lockdowns might of worked (Victoria, Australia) you have many others where it looks like they didn't do jackshit (Argentina, Peru, like all of Europe).  Then you also have places like Sweden that had no lockdown and they've been doing great (though their cases do seem to be climbing again, their deaths aren't).  Florida, despite moving to basically a full re-opening a month ago has seen a steady decline in deaths.</p>
<p>I think if you're worried about the virus, stay home as often as you can.  Wear a mask when you must go out, if that makes you feel safer.  But expecting anything we do to stop the virus in its tracks is foolish optimism.</p>

        <p>Yeah agreed any plans to "protect the vulnerable" should always be dependent on those vulnerable people actually wanting the protection.</p>
<p>From personal experience, the idea of having become a burden to one's loved ones is a huge mental hurdle to overcome for people who are old, weak, vulnerable and/or suffering from a debilitating disease. Taking my dad as an example, he was very open about wanting to die for that very reason (and for not being able to enjoy life anymore) about ten years before he actually passed away and the only reason why he didn't end it all is because my mom could not accept such a thing and always convinced/begged him to stick it out for her sake. It's actually very sad, thinking about all the pain the living make the dying go through for their own selfish reasons..</p>

        <p>My grandparents couldn’t care less haha. They’re definitely in the group of “we’re old already if we get it and die, whatever”. However they live in a facility with a lot of old people and I have a fear, rational or not, that I could give them something and they’d start a wave of infections in the place. I’ve been handling that fear by occasionally having meals with them outside.</p>

        <p>You see it as a corrupt political play. I think I could see it as a pandemic, given the high amount of deaths, that has been corruptly handled for political gain. But I don’t know if I can think of the media hype <em>and</em> people dying as one in the same.</p>
