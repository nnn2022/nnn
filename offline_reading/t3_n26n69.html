    <strong>"How does people being cautious of covid affect you!!"</strong>
    <p><p>At work today a college-age girl ordered a frappe. I spent a couple minutes making it because that's how long it always takes to scoop the ice cream then use the frappe machine. I put it out the window. Another nice old lady in line handed the frappe to the girl, who was off looking at her phone so she didn't see the frappe was ready. Then she starts freaking out, noooo you can't touch it, noooo, covid! She whined about waiting for 45 minutes for the frappe (it was literally 2-3 minutes). So I had to throw a whole large freshly made frappe away, spend a minute explaining to the girl, I had to make her another one. And she wasted my money too because in that 5 minutes I would have probably gotten a buck or two in tips if the line kept moving. I can't even imagine how many times this has happened all over the world in the past year with people wasting people's time and resources throwing perfectly made food away because of "covid."</p></p>
