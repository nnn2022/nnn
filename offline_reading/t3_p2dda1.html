    <strong>Case breakout at work, management lies about it to cover it up.</strong>
    <p><p>At my office, there have been several new cases of coronavirus in the past few weeks since returning. My company is mandating us to return, to the staunch objection of a vast majority of employees (many of whom have made their displeasure very clearly known). The company has instituted a policy that requires weekly covid-19 testing <em>only if you are unvaccinated</em>. You can probably see where this is going.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I overheard a conversation from one of the senior managers about breakthrough covid cases in the office. Apparently, two vaccinated people infected 30+ other coworkers (all of whom were also vaccinated). The company had no idea the vaccinated person was infected because of the 'we only test the unvaccinated' policy. There have been very few positive tests of the unvaccinated in the office. I believe several of those 30+ infected coworkers are now in hospital. Really great vaccine!</p>
<p>A general panic ensued. People were absolutely terrified and didn't know what to think. How long has management been hiding this from people? How severe is it? Do I actually have coronavirus? We need to go back to full time remote!</p>
<p>In the past several weeks or so, there has been a massive amount of resignations from the company. Employees are fleeing to smaller organizations, promising work flexibility and better pay. Management has been dismissive of the brain drain, but they can only ignore it for so long until enough  people leave to where the machine stops moving. They have been throwing money at people in an attempt to keep them, but no one is taking it. They have been flooding local job markets with job postings, but the second that the job candidate asks about remote flexibility and the firm says "we offer none" .. the offer is declined. Managers are becoming frustrated about it as positions on teams go unfilled for literally months at a time. </p>
<p>Management has rejected the calls for remote work, saying no matter what we will remain in the office. A vaccination mandate has not yet come down and I don't think its going to any time soon. There is far too much liability, even in the event of FDA approval. We can also clearly see the reactions of Delta, AA, and Southwest. </p>
<p>My point in saying this -- resist. Leave employers who force you to do these sorts of things. Do not allow yourself to be pushed around. If you dont stand up for what you believe in, well what is your act anyway?</p></p>

        <p>I believe this bc its going on everywhere. It's the most retarded logic in the world.  I went back to a retirement community to do renos Mon. I left in Oct last year bc I wasn't going to take a flu shot and most def wasn't getting the COVid jab. I was talking to the lady that checks everyone in and was explaining to her how the vaxd are spreading the virus and she huffed. The next day I brought her in a handful of articles I printed out and she said she looked it up. Same policy there though. Everyone who is Vd has a colored square on their badge and can be maskless and the unwashed masses must mask up.  I am glad that she took some initiative. </p>
<p>Also 2 of the girls in the design office are both pregnant (4 mo) and they were jabbed in the beginning of the rollout. It will be interesting to see how that plays out over the next few months. I also wonder whether there is truly a saline and a real Vax, being that this is the final trials. Would make sense but I doubt that's the case with these evil fucks</p>
