        <p>Really bad headache for 4 days, 1 day fever of 100, common cold symptoms, lost smell and taste better in 5 days. Took about a month to get my stamina and catch my breath back. I once had the flu for 3 days 101 fever sweats chills and run down for a week. The 2 were very similar. Kids mild symptoms better in 3 days</p>

        <p>Okay, that sounds similar to what I got going on. Honestly I think I would prefer this than the actual flu.</p>

        <p>Yeah I never stopped living my life. I wore a mask for about a month, and when it became clear the government was going to keep moving the goal posts, and it became clear that the entire pandemic has been made to appear more deadly than it really was, I took off the mask. I just wear noise cancelling headphones when I'm in stores, nobody bothers me. I never social distanced or stopped working. I had a fever for a day during the snow storm here in Texas, but that was it.</p>

        <p>The thing that makes it totally obvious that it was made in a lab is how people lost their sense of taste and smell without being congested. That's too strange for a natural coronavirus</p>

        <p>Neither my bf or I have had it and he’s in contact with plenty of people. My mom had it. She’s 68 and has multiple underlying conditions. She said it was like really bad bronchitis, but she’s fine now. One other friend had it and only had a stuffy nose and lost taste and smell for a while. He spent some spare time mixing together terrible things and eating them in front of his kid as a joke. No one else in his household caught it (they weren’t quarantining him in a room or anything). He jokes that dristan must have saved his life. I hope you feel better soon.</p>

        <p>I had it over a year ago. Couldn’t breathe, very low and abnormal oxygen levels, 103 fever... the whole nine yards. Still not 100% and using pump for occasional shortness of breath. Definitely real and also, if I wouldn’t have been so sick I would not believe any of it. This had to be something they unleashed in the cities..everything planned and now they’re trying to shove this deadly vaccine down our throats. I already told my husband I would quit my job if forced to take it, I will never ever take it. I don’t wear masks outside, never did. But I wear it indoors because it’s required EVERYWHERE where I live. Reading a lot about spike protein transmission from vaccinated to unvaccinated and wear mask mainly protect myself ... just in case.</p>
