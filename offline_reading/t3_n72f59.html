    <strong>In this post, I want to defy some of the myths about this sub</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not a republican, actually quite the opposite, I’ve voted for a democratic governor, and Andrew Yang in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>I’m not some conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones nut job viewer. </p>
<p>The earth isn’t flat. It’s quite spherical.</p>
<p>5G doesn’t cause any more cancer than your background environment</p>
<p>I’m not some crazy Christian, I’m actually atheist.</p>
<p>I am NOT antivaxx</p>
<p>I think if you want to wear a mask, you should be able to do so without judgment.</p>
<p>However</p>
<p>I usually get a flu vaccine annually, as well as all the required vaccines to get through my lifetime. My problem isn’t the vaccine!</p>
<p>My problem is the corporatization and rushed nature of the vaccine. I don’t get my flu shot and say “yeah I want the Moderna vaccine not the JnJ”. You say “ey yo get me a flu shot”. All of these companies just happened to be publicly traded, and their value exploded in the last year. Even though JnJ is Probably one of the worst companies I can think of due to their history, and because of that I want to think that their terminal value is zero.</p>
<p>If you’re pro science, why didn’t you wanna a collaboration through these company, to make, potentially one better vaccine, instead of three rushed ones? If This is really truly about the public and not about profits and stock valuations, this is what would have been done</p>
<p>My problem is vaccine passports. Hell, I think if you can, you <em>should</em> get a flu shot, but by absolutely no means do I think you should be required to get one.</p>
<p>I question the effectiveness of masks. They don’t block the virus to get out per se, but they block respiratory droplets. This typically happens when you cough or sneeze, but most normal people use their shirt(if in a pinch), or a Kleenex to cough or sneeze in, which to me at least, blocks those respiratory droplets from becoming in the air. And acts like a mask when you need it.</p>
<p>I won’t argue that masks are not more effective than someone just sneezing in the air, but normal, civilized people don’t do that, and if you do I don’t have a problem with you getting punched in your motherfucking face. And if your not talking like Sylvester the cat, you’re not getting your respiratory droplets on other people.</p>
<p>I know this is sub is mainly a proxy to r/conservative, but that’s not all it is, it’s a group of people who don’t want to be a test dummy for corporations. I will take the vaccine when there’s adequate research and testing done, that you know makes it maybe qualify for actual FDA approval.</p>
<p>I wrote this on the train, going to work. There are spelling mistakes, but I promise, my grammar is better than grade five.</p></p>

        <p>you make some good points here. </p>
<p>no need to qualify your opinions, though. </p>
<p>the people you’re trying to reach don’t care. they will never care. they are too dumb or too unethical and hell bent on despotic tyranny to care about anything other than what they already believe to be true, or what was told to them by “experts” they were deeply conditioned to automatically believe regardless of empirical data or reasoning.</p>
<p>i, for one, <em>am</em> “anti-vax” and will <em>NOT</em> get this vaccine even if it is fully approved by the FDA. </p>
<p>i don’t see this sub as a proxy for r/conservative at all.</p>
<p>people just don’t want the new normal nor all its trappings.</p>

<p>The scary part is that they think they are the smart and ethical ones. It's crazy how two people can have such contrasted views on the same topic. Both were presented with the same evidence and came to completely different conclusions.</p>

        <p>This is exactly how I feel. </p>
<p>I work as a research chemist, I'm all for better living though chemistry. Developed,  tested,  and legit chemistry. The look I got from my boss when she asked if I had gotten the vaccine yet and told her no was awkward to say the least (my work administered the shots on site). And the back peddling to try to avoid the fact she acted inappropriately was worse. </p>

        <p>I've said this before. It's so frustrating that if I say anything critical of the lockdowns or the Covid hysteria people lump me in with all the nut jobs. I made the mistake of starting a conversation about the lockdowns with my next door neighbor.  Now every time I see him he feels the need to tell me about some crazy conspiracy theory and says crazy racist shit because he automatically assumed I was one of them. I feel more isolated due to the "pandemic" not because I can't go anywhere anymore but because of how polarized the world has become.</p>

        <p>I’m talking about them voting to give themselves raises or going on vacation during a pandemic when millions are out of work, or taking forever to pass the relief bills that could help the millions out of work, while they point fingers at one another. Or when they raise the military budget or when they decide to keep the patriot act. They work together extremely well when it’s something that they can benefit from.</p>

        <p>&rt; Lol, also right at the start.</p>
<p>So, kind of like right after 9/11 there were about 2 weeks where everyone trusted the government and was "Banded Together" so to speak... And I'll agree that happened with Covid in March around the same time all our grocery stores were empty. That was also back when people were afraid to touch doorknobs, thanks to our dystopian government/media/scientists.</p>
<p>But I think the unity you recall happened because "2 weeks to flatten the curve" was reasonable. that "unity" you speak of ended shortly after the "2 weeks to flatten the curve" became "Actually, this is the new normal".</p>
<p>But it also seemed to diverge nation wide from the start - In LA it was crazy lockdown and empty shelves in NC it was fine, no grocery shortage or whatnot.</p>
<p>It began to diverge when people weren't dropping dead in the streets like we were told they would, and local governments decided to become Hypochondria Fascists.</p>
<p>And now we are at the point of Florida vs. CA. as far as completely different governments.</p>

        <p>Whatever happened to the basis for the pandemic lockdown, the 65 million dead simulation in x amount of time?</p>
<p>I'm surprised people became divided and forgot about that. I thought everybody would double down to end lockdowns once it was clear the simulation was wrong.</p>

        <p>While probably a "fascist" by modern west coast standards, I am easily a "far leftist" by many rural standards; I am not religious, big on (insert actual social issue here) and *extremely* pro-choice (from abortion to guns to religion to marriage). I will not touch this "vaccine." Two points, one to the stereotype dispelling and one to my logic regarding the vax.  </p>
<p>A year and a half ago, a social media post of mine was removed for being false information, flagged by the usual mob of never-Trumpers as fake news. It read: "There is a lab created disease making its way to the U.S. and all of you are whining about impeachment." Pelosi was in Chinatown, being "not racist" by dancing in the streets and Orange Man was once again "bad" for wanting to close borders. As everyone I knew (including myself, working in the service industry in a seedy nightclub) got extremely sick, I began to wear a mask and gloves. Was called a lunatic, a racist, the whole nine.  </p>
<p>Flash forward a year and I only wear a mask the same way I wear pants (only when asked and out of respect for the business owner), I wash my hands and eat healthy. The SAME PEOPLE who tore me down in 2020 for claiming that "the rona is real" are now calling me a right-wing fascist for not wanting to take the SAME VAX that was "created under Trump" (blah blah insert leftist talking point from last year here). I've also read enough Brave New World to be heavily concerned with the trendiness. "Oooh, I like Ringo! I like Paul! I like Moderna! Ooh, Pfizer is sooooo dreamy."  </p>
<p>As to the science, mRNA re-sequencing is as much of a "vaccine" as any other postmodern bullshit that just uses a new definition. It "identifies" as a vaccine. Shut up and take it, bigot.  </p>
<p>But yeah, again, big fan of David Bowie, drag shows, I loathe cops, supported BLM until white hipsters took it over, loathe rednecks, loathe "anti-vax mom" groups, full vaxxed up against all the poxes and measles and Hep and all that.  </p>
<p>Am not trusting something that was "studied and shown effective" by the same corporate scum who dropped Agent Orange on my uncles.</p>

        <p>I probably should have prefaced this but religion is a spectrum. NOT all Christians are crazy, but a Christian can be crazy, just how someone of any religion(or even lack of religion)can be “extreme”.</p>

        <p>The only way people can accept the fact that there are skeptics out there is if they lump all skeptics into some fantasy archetype like we're all exactly the same kind of person.

        <p>Also not a conservative. I believe in vaccines. I wear my mask. I did my quarantine time and always take it seriously. But my problem with it all? The CDC website itself states they have <em>no</em> idea how long these vaccines protect us again the virus. They also only recommend getting the vaccine because they don't know how long immunity lasts after exposure. The CDC itself says they're looking into natural immunity. </p>
<p>Am I interested in getting the shot in the future? Sure! When there's more research in it. When the CDC can tell me more about immunity. When the FDA <em>actually</em> approves it. When more research is done on the after effects. I want more information on why periods are being affected after the shot. I want more information on  the blood clots. Do I think those will happen to me? No, statistically not. Do I think it's my right to want to know more about it? Yeah, absolutely.</p>

        <p>Yes, the politicization of masks &amp; lockdown policies are a core part of how people ended up supporting them in the first place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skeptical of Covid-19? You are a Trump supporter. (NO!)</li>
<li>Oppose lockdowns &amp; mask mandates? You are racist. (NO!)</li>
</ul>
<p>These things are not true, and it is an inflammatory message pushed in the media so that we divide along political lines.</p>
<p>The more we become entrenched along political lines, the less chance there is in stopping this authoritarian wall of corporate-fascist policies.</p>

        <p>Damn it’s sad that people have to announce they aren’t republican and that they don’t think the earth is flat for people to actually listen. Conspiracy theorizing has become a stigma. If you think different from what the media and corporations tell you then you are questioned and ridiculed. I am concerned about my friends and people close to me wanting to get the vaccine because I don’t want any harm to come their way. You shouldn’t have to be convinced to take an experimental drug and constantly see and hear ads everywhere you go reminding you how “safe” it is.</p>

        <p>My political alignment is more in the middle, but at this point I lean a little more conservative because they're the ones fighting for our freedoms and seem to be a little more home based. But that's just my opinion. I feel that everything is a choice and one should not be punished for that (unless it's like murder or drinking and driving, you know actual harmful shit) I just want my choice</p>

        <p>I agree, this community is about HEALTHY SKEPTICISM regarding how the pandemic's being handled, especially since there's political and economic interests behind it since Day 1; it is NOT a conspiracy theorist community.</p>
<p>Since there ARE interests that don't want skepticism, they'll still paint all this as conspiracy theory, despite any argument to the contrary.  It's not about facts or legit science to them, it's about ideology and conformity.</p>

        <p>I think it's good and healthy to be different with your beliefs or ideals. I'm happy with what you wrote because you're basically preaching the Prime Directive of non-interference. </p>
<p>By the way, I think it's not cool to say "crazy Christian" or "Alex Jones nut job viewer", but it's a free country, so we can say what we want. Everyone's different, and I can respect differing opinions or ideals, so long as no one shoves those ideals down my throat. </p>

        <p>Great post. Thank you so much! I’m also not a republican. But I’m not a democrat either. I suppose I am mostly liberal in my views...I like Jimmy Dore. I’m also an atheist. I have a masters degree in a social science from a liberal arts college. But, I’m here because I am completely against this continual fear mongering campaign by the main stream media/government to create and encourage mass hysteria and to encourage people to hate one another and to point their fingers and shake their fists at each other over a “vaccine”. This should not be a political issue. Just my own opinion. I feel that Every person has a right to decide if they want the vaccine or not, or if they want to keep their faces covered or not, and nobody should be judged either way. I resent being labeled as selfish and evil and told that I should die a painful death just because I don’t want to put something into my body that scares me, or because I don’t want to wear a mask because it makes me feel like I’m suffocating and it causes me to hyperventilate and have anxiety. I don’t scream at or insult people who got the vaccine or wear a mask. It’s their body. Their choice. Just like they shouldn’t scream at us and insult us because we don’t want the vaccine and don’t want to wear a mask. It’s our bodies. Our choice. I feel so alone sometimes because all my coworkers joyfully and excitedly got their vaccinations. And even after they got vaccinated, some have recoiled in fear from me and grab their masks if I walk by their offices because I am not vaccinated. Ive pretty much lost most of my friends because of my views. I’m the only one in my social circle, other than my cousin, who hasn’t gotten the jab. So finding this community here has helped me to not feel so alone. I’m grateful. It’s comforting to know there are lots of us who feel the same way on this issue. Solidarity. 🤝</p>

        <p>I agree 90%... But here is where you're wrong.</p>
<p>No need to acknowledge a party either way, that just shows your bias. I was a republican through the 2000's, and had to realize why that was dumb. At the same time, it's just as fucking dumb to be a democrat... To admit to supporting that sort of group think is embarrassing.</p>
<p>Political parties only serve to divide. They give dumb people something to hold onto, in order to not have to think.</p>
<p>Don't compartmentalize yourself.</p>

        <p>Hi I’m neither liberal or conservative although I do have more liberal views I’m pretty much anti government at this point I’m also agnostic I tried to be Christian a few months ago but that didn’t last long mainly because of how not just Christianity but religion in general treats lgbt people and some of the beliefs and scriptures I find a bit barbaric but at the same time I don’t think people should be prosecuted just because of their religious beliefs I actually have a friend who is Mormon and we both respect each other’s beliefs and don’t force them on each other and she’s actually the only friend I can talk to about this COVID bs neither of us will get the covid shot, I don’t believe people should be forced to get vaccines or wear masks and don’t agree with vaccine pass ports either and I feel like if I were to say this to my liberal friends I’d be probably shunned.</p>
