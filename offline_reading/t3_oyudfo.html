        <p>I'm prepared to be ostracized and exiled. But I'll be free of dangerous and largely unknown adverse reactions. One thing is for certain, I won't die from a mild virus</p>
<p>That is, of course, unless they released <em>another</em> engineered virus with a higher mortality rate</p>

        <p>They finally admitted the pcr couldn't distinguish covid from the flu lmao. Plus they were running it at 45 cycle thresholds, which is fucking insane, completely fraudulent. And look how many people have blindly gone along with it. People taking injections that they don't need, that haven't been tested thoroughly, that nobody is liable for. I don't have words for how insane this all is</p>

        <p>It's complete insanity. Most people don't even know or care that it's insane, they just do what other people do in order to conform and be accepted, and so they could live an easy life without having to do any deep thinking.</p>

        <p>Yes, I wish I had a way of explaining this to those who believe viruses don't exist. It would just be helpful of more people had there energy focused on the same problem, and possibly even a real one.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a real oopsie, an accident. Those who were somehow involved aren't gonna go out of their way to rat themselves out. Plausible deniability up and down.</p>

        <p>It's giving me ajita when I think about it. Sometimes, my thoughts wander towards resigning to the possibility of receiving the jab. </p>
<p>12/10 seem to be doing alright as far as people that I do know. So far, one person got a paralyzed face from the JnJ shot and another got swollen lymph nodes for a week. The former, was a person who had many comorbidities. Ironically, the type of person who would be strongly advised to get it. Yet, also apparently were predisposed. They had a heart-attack or two in the past.  The second person was in the late 70s and had no other adverse effects. Beyond that, some who do get a swollen heart are never aware of it so my records don't cover that. </p>
<p>If it's a mere matter of convenience, then I wont do it. However, if they directly fuck with my money I will be hard-pressed in this economy and at this stage of my life/career. My only hope is that they'll continue to make it easy to get tested on a weekly basis. I hate the idea of having a q-tip shoved up my nose as much as I loved snorting chlorinated pool water. I'm also concerned that by providing this much compliance, I'm only giving the message that "it's okay to push to the next level."</p>
<p>I guess they'll just keep putting the screws to non-participants until they give up. I mean like, if I were to sucucmb.. is it too mcuh to ask "which one is the safest?" Like, maybe one vaccine is more likely to form adverse reactions in French, or Italian people... this would be helpful information for a French or Italian person. </p>
<p>I sure as shit would hate to pick the wrong one and get all fucked by it! Shit, I'd be just as pissed if it only fucked me up a little bit. Anything permanent, no matter how minor, is unacceptable. If I actually do succumb, I'm fucking probably gonna implement a means of reversing the injection. Pray I don't leave a big scar, probably just a deep puncture wound when all is said and done but as long as the juice is out.</p>

        <p>These responses are wildly different lol. The truth is, no one knows.</p>
<p>Just remain true to yourself and in your convictions, have integrity, and you’ll be fine. There are others out there like you, we’ll get through it. It won’t be easy, but stay strong.</p>

        <p>Fucking with people's money does the trick, but they are working on gulags too. I mean like, years ago we heard shit about "FEMA camps" making rounds. I remember one guy from Fox made a big hoopla about an upcoming show of his own and then when the episode became up it was super disappointing. Some people think he was told "nope" during the week after he announced the upcoming show.</p>
<p>Now, Canada's got their own camps along with "hotel quarantine" along with Australia and the UK. In these countries they quarantine anyone who comes in flying from outside, regardless of test result. So anyway, in the U.S. Yeah, Gulag is an option but I think fucking with people's money will work for 90% of us. </p>
<p>You don't need to force people on welfare to accept the shot for the check. You just gotta keep hammering them in the media, and MTV wile also makin them wait an extra 20 minutes when going to the bar. That'll do the trick for many in general.</p>
<p><strong>The question is, what will happen when it's down to the last 10% of hold-outs?</strong></p>

        <p>This is one of my concerns, but at what point or what threshold do we reconsider this possibility?</p>
<p>Two years from now if nobody we know drops, we might say "it'll be another 2-3 years." If a small but meaningful percentage dies or gets an obvious health problem, that should be more noticeable. </p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised of more survive and are incapacitated in some way. Having a bunch of fucked up people due to "new variants from unvaccinated" would really play into the divide and conquer strategy quite nicely.</p>
