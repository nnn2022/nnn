        <p>Found the quote via this interesting article: <a href="https://firstworldwarhiddenhistory.wordpress.com/2018/04/10/fake-history-5-the-peer-review-process/">Fake History 5: The Peer Review Process</a></p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p>&rt;Worryingly, similarities with corruption in academic history and academic medical/pharmaceutical research and reporting appear to be on the increase. Senior academic historians who have succumbed to the lure of status and position, and sold their integrity for financial rewards are to be found in many fields. The corruption of science-based medicine and academic history offers striking parallels. Like peer review in history, the process provides neither an assured filtering process for incorrect findings nor a guarantor of the researchers’ integrity. Professor Richard Horton, editor-in chief of the Lancet – recognised as one of the most highly respected peer-reviewed medical journals in the world – stated recently that the case against science is straightforward: ‘much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.’ [3] History has been faked and science turned towards darkness. Alarm bells should be sounding across the universe. We continue to be lied to.</p>
<p>&rt;These ‘flagrant conflicts of interest’ are the root of the problem in both history and medicine, with a number of senior academics in both fields labouring not for the truth, but for lucrative bonuses paid by powerful paymasters with set agendas. Professor Horton added; ‘Scientists too often sculpt data to fit their preferred theory of the world.’ Horton admits that medical journals themselves are not blameless: ‘Journal editors deserve their fair share of criticism too. We aid and abet the worst behaviours.’ [4] Exactly the same charge can be levelled against even the most prestigious of history journals.</p>
<p>&rt;In 2011 the British Medical Journal quoted Dr Marcia Angell, a long time editor of yet another highly regarded peer-reviewed medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine: ‘It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.” [5]</p>
<p>&rt;In the New York Review of Books, Dr Angell reviewed the work of whistle blowers in the medical field. She revealed that no one knows the total slush money provided by drug companies to influence results, but it’s estimated that the top nine U.S. drug companies alone pay out tens of billions of dollars a year. As a direct consequence, Big Pharma has gained enormous control over how doctors evaluate and use its products. ‘Its extensive ties to physicians, particularly senior faculty at prestigious medical schools, affect the results of research, the way medicine is practiced, and even the definition of what constitutes a disease.’ He added that compromised physicians at the highest levels set the guidelines and treatment recommendations nationally. They sit on governmental advisory panels, head professional societies and speak at regular meetings and dinners that take place to teach clinicians about prescription drugs. [6] Morality is dead. Killed by the greed of the money power.</p>
<p>&rt;A recent survey found that about two thirds of academic medical centres hold equity interest in companies that sponsor research within the same institution. A study of medical school department chairs found that two thirds received departmental income from drug companies and three fifths received personal income. ‘Of the 170 contributors to the most recent edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), ninety-five had financial ties to drug companies, including all of the contributors to the sections on mood disorders and schizophrenia.’ Billions were being spent on unnecessary, non-efficacious psychiatric medicines that might well be doing more harm than good, even to very young children. For example the professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who also held the post of chief of paediatric psychopharmacology at Harvard’s Massachusetts General Hospital, was largely responsible for children as young as two years old being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated with a cocktail of powerful drugs. The professor’s studies of the drugs were, as The New York Times summarised, ‘so small and loosely designed that they were largely inconclusive.’ A U.S. Senator revealed that drug companies, including those that make the drugs the professor advocated for childhood bipolar disorder, had paid him $1.6 million in consultation and speaking fees. Two of his colleagues received similar amounts. [7]</p>
<p>&rt;But this was by no means limited to psychiatry. ‘In 2004, after the National Cholesterol Education Program called for sharply lowering the desired levels of “bad” cholesterol, it was revealed that eight of nine members of the panel writing the recommendations had financial ties to the makers of cholesterol-lowering drugs.’ It is also evident that many members of the standing committees of experts that advise the FDA on drug approvals also have financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.
