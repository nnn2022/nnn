<p>Do these morons understand tax payers fund the NHS? What happens to the NHS when there are no taxpayers because of mass unemployment?</p>
<p>Clapping like fools whilst their economy and job market is crumbling around them. Maybe when the money has run out and mass poverty is in full effect they can clap to put food on the table.</p>

        <p>We are already seeing the complaints about physician salaries being cut and the shock it's happening 'during these times!'. These morons have always depended on the government to regulate supply, demand and salaries so most do not seem to grasp the connection between these things or the limits of the governments ability to force their preferences on market realities.</p>

<p>I'm astonished at how much pure surrender, and call TO surrender I see in this sub.  I'm concerned that it might also be part of that conditioning.</p>

        <p>You know, when I first came to this subreddit, I thought it was a troll started by some bored Redditor. Boy wasI wrong. This is fucking nuts. Not the tweet, your moronic response to it, and to any pro-mask argument. You always come back with one of 4 responses: </p>

<p>This is all a really nice way of saying “I have no argument but please still listen to me because if you don’t I’ll feel bad”. In attending that protest that achieved nothing but increased COVID cases, you have disrespected every single healthcare worker on the damn planet, as well as possibly spread the disease to yourselves and maybe even your relatives or friends. You are so caught up in your damn delusions of rebellion and freedom that you can’t see 3 feet in front of you. You are so narcisisstic and short-sighted that you haven’t taken the time to realize that this isn’t a freedom of choice issue, nor a partisan one. It’s an issue of public health. It’s an issue of not infecting any more people than the 7,000,000+ that have been infected in the US alone. You’re scared because all of a sudden your opinion doesn’t matter. So you grasp at whatever straws you can to make yourself feel important. Don’t you see? You’re measuring your self worth in how much your opinion matters to someone else. You don’t need to do that. There are other ways to go about feeling strong and mighty. You don’t have to spread a deadly disease out of spite for the government in order to do it. </p>
<p>P.S. If you keep calling us brainwashed sheep who blindly trust the media, why don’t you list for us the sources that tell you to not wear a mask. I’m sure they’re very reliable peer-reviewed scientific papers. Oh wait! They’re not! So who would you rather trust. Medical professionals with decades of experience in their field telling you that this disease is killing people and spreading rapidly and all you need to do to prevent it is wear a mask, or Cleetus and Jimbob on Facebook telling you “dem damn guvment people trying to take away our rights!!!”</p>
<p>Edit: I noticed that the majority of people who downvoted my comment didn’t bring an argument as to why they did. Maybe stop being a pussy and actually have an argument next time. Unless you don’t have one.</p>

        <p>If they keep one person from getting sick and dying, they’re worth it. Wearing them doesn’t hurt you. If there’s an even 1% chance wearing a mask could save the life of someone’s grandma, I’m going to wear one. It’s what Jesus would have done.</p>

        <p>you really think a bit of cloth is going to prevent the spread? you are okay with the government telling you where you can go, what you do, who you see? You are okay with having to hand over your personal information just to go to a resteraunt or pub? You think we NEED the government to tell us what to do and enforce these rules to prevent COVID-19. So we must live like scared little sheep in our houses because of this disease? maybe we should live like this forever right? Let's wear masks forever because the common cold is never going away is it? Why should we live like this, what evidence do they have that living like this is the answers to our problems? There is no evidence! We are all going to die one way or another. I don't want to spend the rest of my years or my youth like this? I'm sure no elderly person wants to spend the rest of their days living like this either. Does freedom really mean so little to you? I bet you are the type of person who would grass on your neighbour for not staying 2m apart talking to someone on the street, fucking pathetic. Do you not see how the government is taking advantage of this, do you really believe they have the best intentions and aren't using this to their advantage? You are naïve. You think that being arrested for not wearing a mask is okay? You think the government and the police have a right to tell us what to do and use force to keep us in our homes? Disease or not. That is NO WAY TO LIVE. Wake up.</p>

        <p>Alright. 15 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, I do believe that bit of cloth will prevent the spread because there is empirical data demonstrating that it does. </li>
<li>Yes, I am okay. Barring the fact that it’s the government and they know more than I do, it makes the most logical sense when a pandemic is going around. It makes sense to stay indoors and minimize your risk of getting it.</li>
<li>I have never seen that happen, but if it did I would be fine with it because why would I not be?</li>
<li>Yes, I do think the government needs to tell us what to do because if they don’t idiots like you will go around spreading the disease even faster than you already are. </li>
<li>Yes, because it is a pandemic that is killing thousands of people and we should be scared of it. Not just for the sake of our health, but everyone else’s as well. </li>
<li>No, because if you just started wearing masks, social distancing, and stopped spreading false information like this, the pandemic would end and we wouldn’t have to. </li>
<li>You’re really comparing the common cold, a disease whose only symptoms are a runny nose and occasionally a small fever, to a serious respiratory condition that can lead to long term complications. A disease which has a multitude of cures to a disease that has virtually none? You serious?</li>
<li>The evidence that since the majority of people wear masks and socially distance, the number of cases is pretty low relative to the population of the US which is where I live. </li>
<li>Yes, we are. Now answer this. Would you rather die at the age of 20, or 90? </li>
<li>If you wear masks, socially distance, and stop spreading misinformation, you won’t have to.</li>
<li>See my previous point. Same answer.</li>
<li>It means a lot to me. And if it meant anything to you, you would be willing to minorly inconvenience yourself for a few months so the pandemic ends and we get it back. </li>
<li>Please elaborate on this, because I really have no Idea what you’re trying to say here.</li>
<li>Yes, because it’s a fucking law to wear a mask, and if you break the law, you get arrested.</li>
</ol>
<p>and finally...</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, they do. And they had that power long before the pandemic started. Hell, ever since the country was founded. See point 4 for more information.</li>

        <p>FUCK me. The self-righteousness is overwhelming. 
1) Send me proof that the masks work
2) You really think that the government knows more than you do? You think that they have your best intentions at heart? Jesus christ. They are human, just like us! They don't know more than us. We are all on this planet to live our lives until we pass. We don't need other humans DICTATING to us how we should live our lives. You might be okay with being told what to do and a list of rules to follow like you are an imbecile but I certainly don't. I want the freedom to decide whether I want to wear a mask or not. Decide for myself. Not be FORCED. People are being arrested, fined, their busness closed down. There is debt in the trillions that the taxpayers are going to be paying for decades. People are going to suffer, their children and generations after because the government decided to lockdown. I would say the suffering caused by this panic is astronomically worse than what the number of deaths would have been had we not locked down. They are fear mongering you and it has worked like a treat on you.
3) We shouldn't be scared of it, there are many diseases out there that kill many people. This is another one. We can't beat nature, disease is part of life. We can't just shut ourselves away and it will go away, that isn't how life works. We just destroy peoples livelihoods and the economy for a disease that most people have 1 in a million chance of catching and even then it isn't even fatal. The chances of fatality are very low. More people have recovered than died from it.
4) you really believe everything the government and the media tell you don't you? How we are the demons taking away your freedom because we won't 'comply' to these tyrannical rules on our lives? Ridiculous.
5) Where is the evidence for this? All that bit of cloth does is make you feel safe. Do masks keep out aerosals? Do they keep out smells, dust etc? no and did you know that a virus is a hell of a lot smaller than a dust or areosal particle.
6) Yes I am comparing the common cold to the coronavirus, because the way we are going we will start catastrophising the common cold, flu and various everyday ailments. The coronavirus is no more dangerous to the majority of the population as flu is. The numbers aren't so different.
7) I must behave then? I must comply? I must be FORCED to wear a mask, I must be FORCED to stay in my homes? Then everything will be okay? As long as I do everything the governmenet tell me I suppose I won't have to use any common sense, seing as they know what's best for me over myself.
8) It means fuck all to you clearly. You would rather the security of big daddy government to look after you than your freedom. You choose securty over freedom and are a sucker to be taken in by the panicked masses.
9)Elaborate on what?
10) You think that is a reasonable law? To be FORCED to wear something on MY OWN BODY? 
10) No the only power the government has is through the people. We voted them there. The government, thanks to you muppets have realised just how easy we are to be told what to do with a little bit of fear mongering. Like putty in their hands. Now watch as more and more of our liberties and daily lives are peeled away and we forget what it was like before because we all got used to it. A cashless society, being traced on what we buy and where we go so we can be sized up by businesses to be sold more crap through advertisements and so on. Can't you see how they are going to reap so may benefits due to not challenging them? When the government has more power than the people it is tyranny. The people weren't even asked what the right course of action was. It was just thrust upon us. No fucking discussion, no vote. That is NOT DEMOCRACY.</p>

        <p>This virus is world-wide endemic, and has been since March at the latest, maybe even January.</p>
<p>Trying to prevent the spread of a world-wide endemic virus is as idiotic as trying to prevent clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>Get real.  We must live with it, but instead of talking about what we <strong><em>already know</em></strong> about living with pathogens, legions of retards have developed an 'onion' of layer after layer of misdirection and red herrings, such as "spread" and "cases" and "masks" and "selfishness" and "drugs" and "treatment" and "quarantine" and "vaccine".</p>
<p>There is no evidence any of that is necessary, and THERE CANNOT BE EVIDENCE of any of that being necessary until baseline is met </p>
<p>Baseline is: the immune system getting healthy amounts of all the nutrients it requires to function.  There's nearly two dozen of them, and a few corollary nutrients.</p>
<p>Paper after paper shows that significant portions of the population all around the world don't even get the bare minimums (ie RDA) of various nutrients, much less healthy amounts.  Those statistics are dramatically worse for various cross sections such as the <strong>elderly</strong>, obese, and T2DM patients.</p>
<p>Those nutrients are what our immune system REQUIRES to do its job.  They are the materials and tools that are necessary, and more so when challenged with a pathogen.</p>
<p>This virus is NOT airborne rabies!</p>
<p>No science has ever even as much as proposed, much less found, or for that matter even TRIED to find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Humans have a general requirement for wearing a mask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humans are generally deficient in wearing a mask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A mask generally helps the immune system be healthy/er</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Animals evolved to wear a mask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is any general failure of an immune system which has healthy amounts of all nutrients required by the immune system, that needs solving, and that a mask solves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A mask is generally more prudent instead of healthy amounts of all nutrients required by the immune system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>First you get everybody to get healthy amounts of all nutrients.  We start from the baseline and go from there.  Wearing a mask is far far far down the list on things that people can do.</p>
<p>We start at the top of the list, the baseline, and see where we're at then, and if there even needs to be anything else.</p>
<p>If there needs to be anything else, we start the analytical process from the baseline:  what else can people do to make their immune system not be dysfunctional, etc.  There's a LOT of those things in line ahead of wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Retard says: "Nah. Wear the fucking mask"</p>

        <p>First link:</p>
<p>“A total of 19 randomised controlled trials were included in this study – 8 in community settings, 6 in healthcare settings and 5 as source control. Most of these randomised controlled trials used different interventions and outcome measures. <strong>In the community, masks appeared to be effective with and without hand hygiene, and both together are more protective</strong>. Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well contacts.”</p>
<p>I believe what you’re referring to is in regards to healthcare workers.</p>

        <p>And the evidence it uses to support that claim is by saying if N95 masks are used properly and most people don't have n95 just cloth and surgical and in that studies it says how surgical and cloths were useless</p>

        <p>To answer your second question first: in a hospital where you are coming into contact indoors, possibly working on someone’s ventilator at close range but definitely breathing air in a room where the patient may have sneezed, coughed, etc...an N95 is kind of necessary. (If you like not getting sick.)</p>
<p>In open areas like outside or a hardware store, particle disbursement of a cough or sneeze will be more distributed due to distance, lessening the viral load. Also, N95 masks are easy to make- you can use the filter of a vacuum. </p>
<p>Last, I think (it’s been a minute) that they rated cloth masks at 50% while N95s are, well, 95%. The greater the viral load, the worse the situation is. So even if it is a tiny chance you would get sick, I’m a betting person, and I like the odds to be as much in my favor as possible. I mean, even if you’re pretty sure masks don’t do anything, are you 100% sure? Cause if you’re not, and wearing one isn’t going to hurt you, it’s kind of weird not to.</p>

        <p>If it's mandated mate everyone is wearing dunno if you live in a place with mandated masks and police are serious with those who don't wear masks but the mask usage increases compared to no mandate cause people don't wanna cop a fine even guys like me who don't like masks are forced to wear them and still only rises in cases</p>
<p>But the fact everyone brings in the whole "mandate doesn't equate more masks" doesn't make sense, if masks worked then why do we need to release people from prison why not give every prisoner a mask? Why can't we open up movie theatres "just give everyone a mask" </p>
<p>So if mask mandates with high compliance doesn't work then what proof is there? </p>

        <p>Your argument is false. First of all, viruses always bind themselves to something larger, so they don’t fit through the holes in N95 masks. Second of all, size matters, but not in the way you thing. Yes, N95 masks do have pores around .3 microns in size, but they are actually most effective in blocking particles that are either larger or SMALLER than the holes. There are a number of factors that play into this. See https://www.google.com/search?q=masks%20are%20too%20big%20to%20block%20out%20covid&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-m for more information by m</p>

        <p>If the size of a coronavirus particle is smaller then what a N95 mask can block, and N95 should be preserved for healthcare workers not everyday folks, most are wearing cloth and surgical masks</p>

        <p>Even trying to trick people into being distracted by a question of if masks "work or don't work" is a red herring misdirection.</p>
<p>The question to be asking is: are there more significant things people can realistically do that are better choices.</p>
<p>The human body has NO general mask requirements.  There is NO general recommend amount of mask wearing.  Animals did NOT evolve for 500 million years to wear a mask.  Masks do NOT generally make people healthier.  Masks do NOT generally make the immune system more healthy.</p>
<p>A better measure could be related to something(s) that:</p>
<ul>

<p>The baseline is where science ALWAYS starts.  Only when baseline it met, then do you start looking for other things (in science).</p>

<p>Human rights, freedoms aren't important? It is okay they are being removed by government where we cannot get an education, practice our religion, leave our states in some places, leave our country? Live our lives? It is okay to you? Why? For what reason?</p>
