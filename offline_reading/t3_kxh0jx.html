    <strong>Just ratted out by the doomers at my gym for not wearing a mask!</strong>
    <p><p>My local government shutdown the gyms between 9pm and 5am. To avoid the doomers, I went at 5am when the gym isn’t usually staffed and didn’t wear the mask then while there so few people there. Today, I go into the gym now after work because going at 5am is so tiresome sometimes but I still want to be healthy. As I walk in the door, one of the gym staff calls me out by name and tells me “a concerned member emailed them about me and said one was not wearing a mask in the gym. They checked the video and it was me.” The staff lady said , “if the board of health came in and saw someone not wearing a mask, we’d be shutdown. As shitty as these things are to wear, we still have to wear them for <em>safety</em>. “ As fucked as it would be for them, I don’t want to endanger their business and the gym is my last refuge of sanctity. It’s all dumb too because I see their staff not wearing masks in their office too, but I don’t want to snitch on them. Guess I’ll comply for now while working out, but fuck this virus and fuck the doomers. Sorry for any misspellings. End rant/</p></p>

        <p>Just keep it around your chin. I rarely wear a mask out in public but at the mall I walked by security with one on my chin and they didn't say anything. I then took it off a 10 minutes later two different guards asked me put it on. Not sure what it's like in your city but most people here know it's just a symbol.</p>

        <p>Absolute losers these people are.  They've never been in charge as so much as a hotdog cart, they've never had any power in their whole weak, pathetic lives - and now it's their time to shine because they have seemingly everyone behind them to back them up.</p>

        <p>We ALL need to dig our heels in and just flat out REFUSE to wear them. Even if it means we can’t go to the gym, or ride the bus, or take a plane, or go to that restaurant, or that store. If everyone here did that and stopped make chin concessions, it WOULD make a difference.</p>
