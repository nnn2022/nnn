    <strong>Top 13 ‘Mistakes’ Made By Our Leaders During The ‘Pandemic’</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>Listening to scientists with vested and conflicted interests and their obscenely exaggerated computer modelling</li>
<li>Placing the sick (back) in care/ nursing homes at the start, and now promising to do the same this winter</li>
<li>Not recommending vitamins, supplements and healthy practices during the lockdowns, while only offering vaccines as the solution and key to our parole or freedom</li>
<li>Using ventilators to treat (and then kill) patients</li>
<li>Listening exclusively to vaccine advocates and their bought-and-paid-for media minions, while censoring or firing those who dissent or disagree. The demonisation of existing effective treatments</li>
<li>False scare stories about children, healthy adults and pets etc being equally susceptible to COVID</li>
<li>Practices of incentivising hospitals and medical professionals to put COVID down as - mostly inaccurate - causes of death. Refusing to discuss co-morbidities until recently</li>
<li>Using testing procedures with proven propensity to produce false positives</li>
<li>Inaccurate data about the spread of the virus on surfaces (porous and non-porous)</li>
<li>Promoting unhealthy and immune suppressant practices such as mask wearing, goggles, over-sanitation of hands etc</li>
<li>Allowing one form of political protest, while banning others under the pretext of ‘super-spread’</li>
<li>Allowing the media to conflate deaths with cases</li>
</ol>
<p>and - of course - the biggest of them all...</p>
<p>13) Locking down the world - many, many more deaths are already and will be attributable to the direct consequences of the lockdowns than from the virus itself. Governments then doubling down on their ’mistakes’ by repeating them. Destroying lives and the economy as a result.</p>
<p>These are off the top of my head. Plenty, plenty more I’ve missed. Please leave your ‘favourites’ in the comments.</p></p>

        <p>It's all about that vaccine. They want us so miserable that we're begging for it, if it offers the promise of returning to even a small shred of normalcy. Of course, certain "inconveniences" will remain. Tracking and spying on us, censorship, cashless payment, rolling lockdowns and other systems of control.</p>

        <p>I think it's not about the mistakes our leaders made, I think none of this would have been a problem if people thought for themselves and valued their freedoms.</p>
<p>It seems in the UK at least people are only too happy to hand away their freedoms in the hope of staying alive a bit longer.</p>
<p>Only for us to find out that we don't even get what we were promised.</p>
<p>Cancer patients are currently being threatened with their care being denied if covid CASES go up.</p>
<p>We gave up our freedoms and we're getting death in return.</p>

        <p>I’m in the US but I’m so disgusted that every individual and business just followed the herd and didn’t even question business closures and mask mandates. Just unanimously agreed that it was “for the best” because “health and safety.”</p>

        <p>Ignoring every bit of good news that comes out about fatality rates, treatments, etc. and continuing to push the vaccine. They want the huge payouts, no doubt. They should have started lifting restrictions as soon as it became clear that this was not a death threat to the vast majority of people who get it. </p>
<p>Pushing “testing, testing, testing”. Why would I get a test for absolutely no reason? </p>
<p>Making healthy people wear masks everywhere and telling businesses to enforce it rather than leaving the choice up to the business. Making healthy people change their lives to accommodate others, including those who are just plain germaphobic. </p>
<p>Keeping restrictions for a long period of time out of their own fear of “cases.”</p>
