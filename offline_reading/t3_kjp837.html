    <strong>Advice for quitting drinking?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve always enjoyed drinking socially but ever since March it’s gotten out of control and I’m just depressed drinking at home. I’ve gone through long periods of sobriety before and it wasn’t even hard, so I know I can do it, but that was when the world was normal and it was easy to find other things to do without constant reminders of covid and feelings of hopelessness.</p>
<p>That being said I would love to hear from any of you who’ve managed to stop or drastically cut back on drinking after feeling like you were starting to have a problem. I know this isn’t a sobriety sub and that there are support communities on Reddit like r/stopdrinking but I’m concerned I could get attacked for being candid about my views on there. I want to hear specifically from people in similar situations coming from an anti-lockdown, anti-new normal perspective, as I think the pandemic response is intrinsic to why I’m so depressed and having issues with alcohol.</p>
<p>If this is too far outside the spectrum of this sub, feel free to delete it. P.S. please be nice!</p></p>

        <p>Hey man, I feel you.
Every October and March, I don’t drink.
The reasons are personal, but I have stuck to it for 7 years .
You just have to decide to do it.  Don’t get wrapped into the misery, we need you with us.
I have been able to stick with it through all this shit and sadness.</p>

        <p>I hear what you're saying. I quit drinking about 1.5 years ago. It can be a real task to quit when you are a regular drinker.</p>
<p>I would start with books like This Naked Mind. It helped me to finally make the decision to stop and stick with it. Kick the drink easily is also really good.</p>
<p>Don't beat yourself up if you are having a hard time stopping. Alcohol is one of the most addictive drugs on the planet, next to heroin. </p>
<p>Feel free to DM if you ever want to connect.</p>
<p>Also, this youtube channel helped me a lot. Definitely worth checking out some videos.</p>

        <p>Uggh I gained so much weight by pity drinking thick stouts from March through May. I also stopped exercising those months. So one day I decided to get ahold to myself and only drink on weekends and make sure I workout before bed on weeknights. I've done extremely well with it. I stopped gaining, but can't get it off. Lockdown stress isn't helping. It was just my birthday and now the holiday, so I'm going to do what I want for the rest of 2020, but come January 1st, I'll go back to a nice weekday routine of no alcohol, healthy snacks, and my yoga routine. </p>
<p>Best of luck!!!</p>

        <p>Not drinking is going to leave a void. You need to find something else that you feel good about to fill that void. Drinking is a function of something larger within yourself. You can't just stop drinking. It's a good first step, but you're going to fail if you don't find something to fill that void and if you don't address what creates the need to drink in the first place. You have to change.</p>

        <p>Just try to resolve to not drink for one day. Then hopefully build some momentum to where you drink maybe a few days a week until you eventually start stacking sober days and weeks on top of each other.</p>
<p>On day one of no booze try to do something productive like clean the house/apartment. It’ll give you a small victory and sense of accomplishment.</p>

        <p>1P LSD or regular LSD. Do a tab and reflect on your habits all night in quiet darkness. Not joking either. Start taking NAC and 5HTP supplements daily. L-Theanine when you need it for anxiety. Might be so effective you stop smoking too.</p>

        <p>They are amazing and pretty much solved many of my issues in the past. Psilocybin is truly nature’s medicine. It’s a cure for anxiety and depression beyond what big pharma could ever dream of. Just not sure where to get them and kind of stuck in a cycle of depression at the moment.</p>

        <p>Recognise that chronic drinking makes one numb - it makes the highs lower and the lows higher, shifting everything over to a bland grey medium. It weakens you in the long run. Knowing it's not actually helping will help to change your attitude to it.</p>
<p>Drink also stops one from subconscious processing of their emotions, which are needed to resolve inner conflicts. I read somewhere that depression is a self defence mechanism from experiencing anger and its consequences which may be up your alley right now. Ironically, to process the emotions about why one drinks  so that you can stop drinking, you have to stop drinking in the first place.</p>
<p>The opposite of addiction isn't sobriety, its connection. Milk as much as you can from any facet of your life as possible. Take up a new language and practice with people, buy a new book, a hobby, anything that's immersive. Find a YouTube video on guided meditation and try it out. As stupid as Skype and zoom are they are good for staying sane and interacting with others, just dont buy into the <em>this has to be normal socialising hereon</em> rhetoric.</p>
<p>Here's a great little comic to read which is relevant to addiction and sadness: http://utw10426.utweb.utexas.edu/quest/Q3/ratpark.html</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>Whenever I sink down due to all this shitty situation (and I do so in different ways: getting sad, depressed, nervous, unsocial), I say to myself 'I won't let this fuck me. This is what they want - whoever they are - for me and us all to sit home fucked up, to regress, regress regress. They can go fuck themselves". </p>
<p>IDK if this helps, but I am curious - what do you (generally and now) drink alcohol for - to get calmer, less anxious, less agitated, more optimistic - what precisely?</p>

        <p>As others have said, drinking is just a symptom of a larger problem— a “god-sized problem.” It’s about finding the spiritual truth within ourselves. This society is sick and has led us astray from our divine nature. I might sound woo woo, but I was drunk most of my 20s and when I finally hit rock bottom and decided to stop drinking it left me in a world of pain. But that pain eventually led me to an expansion of consciousness that I could never have dreamt of. Sometimes I still regret all those years I wasted in oblivion and numbness, but without it I may have just been another doomer NPC.</p>
<p>I imagine there’s no AA groups around you, but it can be a good first step. I recommend reading “A Guide for the Perplexed” by EF Schumacher. It was a big push for me in another direction. PM if you want more spiritually minded texts, I have a boatload of recommendations.</p>
<p>Meditation is tough when you’re coming off an addiction, but it helps. The breath is everything. If you can find someone who facilitates holotropic breathing, I highly recommend that. Ayahuasca might also help.</p>
<p>Good luck, and know that you are not alone. Many of us have tread this path and come out the other side for the better.</p>

        <p>Try CBD, I quit drinking/drugging back in august, have no desire anymore.  Started struggling a little with schizophrenia due to the COVID hysteria and family/friend issues, CBD helped a lot; it’s a much more relaxing and calming effect compared to THC and helps with mental illness (at least in my experience).</p>
<p>Shit, depending on where you are, if you can swing it, growing some CBD plants would be pretty therapeutic too: I started growing back in March, which kinda helped kick the drinking too.</p>
