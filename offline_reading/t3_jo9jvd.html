    <strong>So the fearful and the lazy are deciding the fate of an entire nation...</strong>
    <p><p>I'm told that over 60 million American voters used mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>60 million people were either so lazy, or so fearful of the Big Bad 'Rona, that they couldn't be arsed to get off their couches and go vote in person. These are the people that are deciding the future course of the United States!</p>
<p>Men stormed God-forsaken Pacific islands and beaches in France to preserve the right to go to a polling station in person and vote. These people threw in the towel for a glorified flu bug. They should have their franchise removed forever.</p>
<p>And of course, look who has benefited from mail-in voting - the party running a senile puppet who is simply a cover for a corrupt, race-baiting ex-mistress of a corrupt, race-baiting mayor - who will call the real shots!</p>
<p>Courtesy of Corona-panic and mail-in ballots... the train is about to arrive at the station named  "tyranny".</p>
