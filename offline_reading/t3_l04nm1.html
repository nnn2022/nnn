    <strong>Conspiracy of the Week. Did someone say SARS? Tuesday 12 August 2003</strong>
    <p><p>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/228669387</p>
<p>The early parts of 2003 heralded the introduction of a lethal, mutated virus. SARS quickly enveloped the globe, claimed hundreds of lives, and infected thousands more. Televised news broadcasts, as well as the print media, were literally struggling to fit in non-SARS related stories barely four months ago. Identified as a mutated form of coronavirus (the common cold), SARS was an overnight horror story - a biological Armageddon.</p>
<p>Within hours of news escaping China, the World Health Organisation had issued a global warning that some kind of pandemic could well be imminent. It was around mid-March that the term 'lethal pneumonia' was picked up by global news services; 'mutated virus' was also used frequently. The media jumped on the hype bandwagon within hours of the news coming out. People began stockpiling canned goods, and pressure on the goverments around the world to do something about the unrestrained spread of the virus rapidly increased. In the US, approval to manufacture a pharmaceutical solution, which normally requires months of wading through red</p>
<p>tape, was given the green light instantly. Legislation for funding, as well as harsher quarantine laws, were passed so quickly that few people even noticed. The virus has claimed roughly 500 people from around the globe over a period spanning just over four months. It can be estimated that over the course of a year that figure would rise to somewhere around 1500. At the beginning of the 'outbreak' the Hong Kong Health Minster was interviewed</p>
<p>by the BBC. He admitted that there was no definitive test for SARS, and that the symptoms of this illness were particularly vague. As the symptoms are so common and are shared by many other illnesses, SARS patients are diagnosed by visual assessment only. How many times was vital information about a SARS victim given out by the media? Did news stations ever broadcast the age, physical condition, or any other relevant statistics? As far as basic journalism is</p>
<p>concerned, the reporting was of abysmally poor standards. On that subject, when we saw journalists reporting from so called 'hot spots' or 'epicentres', were any of them seen wearing what were said to be lifesaving facemasks? The BBC made mention of this when questioned by another independent journalist, but nothing further was ever released. In 2002, common influenza claimed the lives of 26,000 people in the United States alone.</p>
<p>That equates to about 71 people every day; two to three times the rate at which SARS was claiming its victims. Malaria claims more than 5000 people every single day. Yet our peak international body, the WHO, saw fit to issue a global warning relating to SARS. There has been no international outcry about either of these illnesses, or any other major killers for that matter. SARS, for some reason, was exceptional.</p>
<p>Throughout Europe and North America, swathes of the population called for stricter laws relating to freedom of movement, and Governments were more than happy to oblige. In many cases police were given greater powers to enforce quarantines. On April the 23rd, Australian police were given much wider powers regarding the enforcement of quarantines. Singapore's Prime Minister vowed to his Parliament that he would jail anyone who acted irresponsibly. The pharmaceutical conglom-erates in both the US and Europe form exceptionally powerful lobby groups. The money that was donated to President Bush for his election campaign can, and often is,</p>
<p>related to the decision made by the US to refuse to ratify a deal that would provide developing nations with generic brands pharmaceuticals. What better way to increase sales and profits than create mass global hysteria? When it is realised that the majority of products that alleviated SARS symptoms were already on the shelves, it seems relatively simple to jump to the conclusion that, for one reason or another, the severity of the virus was grossly overstated to the general public.</p></p>
