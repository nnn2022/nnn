    <strong>Let's talk about the "lab leak theory".</strong>
    <p><p>It feels like scientists secretly did some Jurassic Park shit that went wrong and then waited a year to admit to it because they knew how pissed everyone would be but if there was a coverup all of this time and now they admit it's man-made, does that change how you see nnn type stuff or the virus specifically?</p>
<p>I'll reply separately for my two cents...</p></p>

        <p>The story of it being created in a lab is complete bullshit imo. Just part of the psy-op. They’re just trying to get some of the holdouts to take the vax. The real story is that there never was a virus.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what I think.</p>
<p>I think it's a scary new motivation to get the shot, and the next phase of the psy-op, like you say. I do like the blaming the CCP part, but I still see no evidence of an actual virus.</p>

        <p>No its very possible some virus leaked out of the wuhan institute. it was very deadly, thus the ccp insantly barricaded wuhan inhabitants into their home, full dystopia style.
but they quickly ended that again. </p>
<p>but: this leak doesnt necessarily have to do with the "pandemic" we are experiencing now. maybe some crazy virus leaked but was super quickly contained. glibalists saw the opportunity and pushed the who to declare a pandemic, for the purpose of control and pharma sales</p>

        <p>Let's not conflate the "Lab Leak Theory" with the "Man Made Theory"  The two can exist independently.  It could have leaked while it was simply being studied in the lab, no need for any human origin.  There is also the "Purposefully released" theory which again is totally separate.  Any combination of these may be true, but it doesn't help to lump them together.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you are right.</p>
<p>I would like to know more about the state of mRNA technology prior to 2020.  I remember somebody saying that that kind of radical technology was nowhere near FDA approval and got backdoored in via the EUA (emergency use authorization).</p>
<p>If I was in charge of that I would have done a slow rollout of something much smaller in scale and make it more clear to the test subjects that it was an experimental treatment.  Most importantly, I would want to see patient outcomes at least a year or two down the road but ideally much longer to have enough confidence to do something crazy like try for universal vaccination.</p>
<p>I understand that often market forces cause products to be released without proper testing but we aren't talking about the new iPhone here...  I can't believe that so many people have so much faith in this technology and are willing to bet their reputation and conscience on that.</p>
<p>I thought about this a lot when the whole vaccine mod controversy happened and I came to the conclusion that it would be irresponsible to do that either way because either the vaccine could have unforeseen problems due to a lack of testing and also the obvious risk of not taking it.</p>

        <p>This thing is in the center of everything. I think one or two months after the start of this plandemic, big pharma was already trying to sign contracts with the nations. Plus the controversial content of those contracts and how all the effects of the medication aren’t being wide debated.</p>

        <p>Basically, I think it's outrageous to withhold that rather important detail because presumably, it would affect your approach to stopping or mitigating the damage etc.</p>
<p>At this point however, we know enough about it that it's something to be mindful of but not dramatically alter our way of a life in numerous ways indefinitely.  I have always assumed that due to it's contagious nature, it was unlikely to be contained just like we try and fail to do with influenza.</p>

        <p>If you read carefully, it's clear that they only modeled the so-called "spike protein" which would then be used in the deadly vaccine. "Covid" never existed and was a massive scam to get these sussy vaccines into people's bodies.</p>
<p>Think about it: if a super-deadly virus actually escaped from a lab, they wouldn't need a massive PR campaign to get people scared, they wouldn't need bogus PCR tests to find "asymptomatic" cases, they wouldn't need a boatload of midazolam to kill people in long term care facilities and so on. There was no pandemic, no virus, only a dangerous vaccine that nobody would have taken without all this hullaballoo.</p>

        <p>Flu cases were counted as 'rona in many cases I'm sure.  Also, people becoming deathly afraid of one another I'm sure played a part.  Or maybe, the miracle of masking, haha.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown per the CDC which in my mind explains why it spreads effectively.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm</p>
<p>I think opportunism to the situation was part of what spun things out of control, among other things.  But yeah, without the media and masks etc. I would be oblivious to covid.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that the CDC is captured by the drug companies. You'll notice that their pronouncements always assist in securing those juicy "durable income streams".</p>
<p>We'll probably have to agree to disagree, it's just so obvious to me that the entire thing was faked to benefit Pfizer and the rest of the greasy crooks. There was no pandemic, no special virus, they just rebranded the flu, used false-positive tests to get "cases" and gassed a bunch of old people with midazolam to juice the stats.</p>
<p>If you're worried about bioweapons, the vaccine meets the definition so we should focus on that.</p>

<p>Or, if you dare, here is the<a href="https://yurideigin.medium.com/lab-made-cov2-genealogy-through-the-lens-of-gain-of-function-research-f96dd7413748"> hour long read version</a>, haha. but I will give the conclusion as well.</p>
<p>"How I Learned to Hate the GOF
I hope this post is not used to prematurely assign blame or propagate one-sided theories. What I do hope it highlights is the scale of dangerous gain-of-function research that has been and is going on in virology. The Covid-19 pandemic really exposed its huge risks in the face of few benefits: GOF research hasn’t protected us from this outbreak, hasn’t provided us with any effective treatments or vaccines in time to save hundreds of thousands of lives lost to CoV2, and if there is even a 0.1% chance GOF research caused the whole thing, that chance is too high."</p>
