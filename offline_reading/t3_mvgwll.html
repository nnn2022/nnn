    <strong>Wouldn't NOT getting vaccinated protect more people?</strong>
    <p><p>Hear me out a sec - </p>
<p>According to the "science" you can still get COVID even if you are vaxxed, it just won't be as severe.  And as Fauxci says, you can still infect others with COVID if you are vaxxed, that's why you still have to wear a mask.</p>
<p>So if I get COVID, isn't it better if I get really sick so that I know I have it and I stay home and don't run around spreading the plague?  If I get it and don't feel very ill I would be more likely to not stay home and quarantine myself, right?</p></p>

        <p>&rt; According to the "science" you can still get COVID even if you are vaxxed, it just won't be as severe.</p>
<p>Unproven, relies on junk science about PCR positive meaning "infected".  (For some people, any disease or vaccine may be incapable of producing a robust immune response, but this isn't significant for spread.)</p>
<p>And yet, you're still right.  If you're young, healthy, and social, you're better off getting and spreading diseases to other young, healthy, and social people to saturate that bracket with immune people as fast as possible.  Exposing the 15-35 social crowd fast and early is always the best route to herd immunity. (as long as the disease is mild for them, as is the case here.  different rules with ebola, hiv)</p>

        <p>This is why they need EVERYONE to get the vaccine, but they don't account for the people who can't get it due to known allergies etc. So much for protecting the most vulnerable.</p>

        <p>The bigger irony is that (in theory) in order for the mRNA treatment to be successful, you should come into contact with covid so your body can defeat it easily and get natural immunity. </p>
<p>By wearing masks, social distancing, and staying inside,  you render the treatment useless cuz youll never actually get herd immunity. Youll just have mRNA antibodies floating around your body doing precisely nothing.</p>

        <p>We'll yeah if you did get COVID and you stayed at home you'd have less chances of spreading it to other people as compared to you getting vaxxed and going about your business normally. But you could also die. So no mate I'm just trying to look out for you I don't want you or anyone else to die unnecessarily.</p>

        <p>A vaccinated person MAY be able to catch and spread Covid, but it is much less likely. A vaccinated immune system will likely defeat the virus before it reaches high enough concentrations to spread through the air.</p>
<p>It's still worth being careful around vulnerable, unvaccinated people though.</p>
