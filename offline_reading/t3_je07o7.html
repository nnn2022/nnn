    <strong>I am so proud of my friends group</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve got a group of former co-workers that I still talk to often, and we hang out every month or so for drinks and watching sports. Pretty normal. </p>
<p>Since COVID, our Discord has devolved into doomerism and refusing to hang out, until yesterday. </p>
<p>The biggest doomer of them all offered to video chat in while we hung out, but we declined. Instead, the rest of us got together and it was so normal. Yesterday drinking beers and watching the NFL was the happiest I’ve been in 5+ months. I was probably borderline depressed but now I feel like a hungover million bucks. </p>
<p>One by one people would show up wearing mask as a common courtesy to the host, then each person realized that no one else was wearing masks, and everyone took them off. Even the people who nod along as the doomer goes off in Discord seemed relieved that he wasn’t there babysitting and felt free to just be themselves again for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>A paranoid vocal minority is running this country, and babysitting society into oblivion. It takes one person in a group to stand-up and say no and you can have a small glimpse of what normal used to be. And it’s great.</p></p>

        <p>I'm in the process of selling my home.</p>
<p>everyone that came had a mask.</p>
<p>my agent, her photographer. i told each one "you are wearing that for yourself, they are not required in my home " </p>
<p>everyone thanked me and yanked their mask off. </p>
<p>i told her photographer, you can wear your mask, but don't bring that nikon shit into my house LOL . (i'm canon)  he got a kick out of that. </p>
<p>cop came to look at the house, i told him the same, he said "thank god, this is such stupid shit".</p>
<p>i think the "silent majority" are just behaving as typical, until we have taken as much bullshit as we can.</p>

        <p>Everyone needs a little push or some encouragement. Many, if not most of the people you see who wear a mask wouldn't hesitate to take it off if they knew they were around like minds. Obviously the people who drive with them on or wear them while out for a walk are lost causes but I suspect that is a shrinking minority.</p>

        <p>Good. I'm tired of giving into what these sneaky liberals want. The Great Reset is in motion. I am scared for the future of our country and our freedom as sovereign citizens.</p>
