    <strong>Is this a joke sub or serious?</strong>
    <p><p>Just discovered this sub and I can‚Äôt tell whether or not this is a parody of conservatism or actual conservative discourse. So many posts and comments that are highly upvoted can easily be rationally explained or shown to be incorrect with a quick google search. Even the memes are ambiguous to me because it‚Äôs so easy to find solid counter points to the punchline</p></p>

        <p>I don't give 2 shits about "left vs right", political parties, or any of that. In fact I highly suspect all of those are false dichotomies put in place to distract people from the real issues.</p>
<p>But there's sanity, and there's whatever TF 2020 ended up being. If you Google hard enough you can probably find a convincing argument that 2 + 2 = 5 but that doesn't make it true. People are meme-ing and posting useful info because everything on the news is a lie lately and we'd all like to lift our spirits a bit after dealing with that constant parade of crap.</p>

        <p>I've been her for months and im still not always sure. I think it has an even mix tbh. I'm kinda on the fence and that I think it's possible the corona "plandemic" was some kind of plan to hide and achieve something, but most of the theories seem just so insane. And it's all stuff that most world governments are already doing anyway with less effort. But it's doesn't mean bill gates isn't microchipping african children with vaccines, but wouldn't it be more effective to use his wealth to pass legislation for phones that the government pays for?</p>

        <p>More to do with coercing people to take a vaccine they have every right to be hesitant about.  Who created the opioid epidemic?  That's right, pharmaceutical companies. 
Exploiting swine flu 10 years ago and exaggerating how dire a risk it posed to people so everyone though they needed a vaccine?  Pharmaceutical companies, CDC, WHO.  https://healthcare-in-europe.com/en/news/european-parliament-to-investigate-who-pandemic-scandal.html</p>
<p>Now you've got Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum on the scene.  Openly mentioning a global need to shift all of our societies toward a collective response to pandemics and climate change.  Which I'm sure is all in good faith and nothing to be concerned about.  </p>
<p>You keep going after the low hanging fruit though and not questioning what you probably know in your gut doesn't really make sense.</p>

<p>Your probably right, but I really just don't know, and kinda don't care about microchipping kids in africa, and global climate change is a concern imo, but i don't think it's as big of a deal as they've made it out to be.</p>

        <p>A vaccine seems pretty sane. A full country quarantine and some of the shit I've seen up north no, not at all. Not even to mention some fo the stuff in australia and the Uk, or south africa. </p>
<p>I think A cloth face covering slows the flu, and it's not like anyone still saying you get covid from 5g towers anymore genuinely.</p>
<p>But really I think the masks just make SOME people feel better or less scared, though inconvenienced to most, I don't see it as a problem, but I've been told by docs to wear a medical mask in the winter because I tend to get respiratory issues, so it's business as usual at least half the year for me. But I've caught it despite wearing a mask from my wife who works in child care. So I don't think the masks really work much. If it makes people feel better, I don't see much problem with it. </p>
<p>I'm sorry if my view upsets people, but making jokes is the way alot of people cope with tragedy, and memes are the coping mechanism of the younger generation.</p>

        <p>I dont know about 5g giving you a virus but having constant radio waves going through your body is probably harmful. The issue here is that anyone who questions lockdown is immediately labelled a nutjob conspiracy theorist. I think it's safe to assume that we don't all have the same beliefs in this sub. But we do bounce ideas around and discuss them. </p>

        <p>Oh for sure, I don't even eat microwaved food. I didn't mean to imply that anyone who questions a lockdown IS a nutjob, just that I've seen some pretty nutjob conspiracy theories that got alot of traction, and many talking about them as of they were absolute undeniable facts like the sky is blue. I'm all for sharing ideas, and I even hold the belief that it's quite possible this virus didn't come from a wet market in china, but could've been an accidental exposure in a lab designing biological population control viruses. I'm no expert, I just wouldn't put it past China, to do something like that to its own people, or even more likely offensively to India. Especially with how they tried to cover it up at first. </p>
<p>And no, I wasn't wearing a mask at home, and yes I assume I got it from my wife, because, despite no symptoms from me or my daughter, she, myself and our daughter tested positive. Wife was sick for two weeks, it wasn't that bad for her though. Daughter was completely fine, and I felt kinda weird for about a day. I also tested positive two other times, early this year, and was sick for two weeks, so I have some questions about the statement of "you can't get it twice" that is widely accepted, or the accuracy of the testing in the US. And I have some speculation about all the recorded deaths. Like my grandmother developed TB from the flu, and died in 2018. We wouldn't say that she died from the flu would we? Because she died from TB. If a 90 yo with a heart or lung condition dies from complications of the heart or respiratory failure caused by complications of Covid, it's counted as a covid death, but that dude was probably going to die soon if he got the flu. You can't know for sure obviously, but with the testing being so bad, can you even know if the complications were really from covid, and not just the flu? So I'm very familiar with being called a nutjob conspiracy theorist for what I'd consider fairly logical and straightforward ideas that I hold. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I also don't believe JFK was killed by some random and a high caliber bullet bounce around the back of his head, into his chest, off the steering wheel and into two other people, especially when my old man was there and anytime it's brought up swears there was more than two gunshots AND his brains came out the back, which is just not how an entry wound works. </p>
<p>And just like covid deaths, it's a sad thing to talk about, people losing thier lives, loved ones dying, but if it wasn't government malice, then it was just random happenstance, which is way way worse, and as a world need to step up and find a way to keep it from happening again. But we live in a country where we can't trust our government not to rig an election(bush in florida I mean, idk about trump in 2016 or biden in 2020, but I wouldn't put it past either side), so I don't think there's much we can really do other than question, but we have to accept that this type of forum is gonna bring out not just the people simply questioning thier government(as they should be doing) but also people spreading thier own nutjob conspiracies. And to ignore the bad nutjob stuff, because we're doing good by questioning our governments, is, at least in my opinion, just as bad as writing the whole forum off as a joke. But I think some people have made some nutjob theories as a joke, that got alot of traction here. </p>
<p>That's for coming to my tedtalk.</p>

<p>That really made me laugh. </p>
<p>I think the most important thing is to question what's going on and being open to all possibilities. I wasn't accusing you of anything btw. I'm just getting exhausted with all the ignorance around this subject and the people who bug me most are the ones who just lazily throw the conspiracy theorist label around, thinking 1. that they're being clever and 2. that's all they need to say to win the argument. I find it pathetic that so called intelligent people refuse to watch a 5 minute video or read an article because it's just easier to label it all as fake news. </p>
<p>I spent months worrying about the future of mankind and trying to wake my friends up but I've realised now that most people have either been brainwashed or they're just too selfish/stupid to open their minds but either way, I've stopped caring what happens to most of them. The only way we're ever going to have a brighter future is to stick together against tyranny but I'm running out of ideas on how to achieve that.</p>

        <p>I mean, I'm not gonna watch a 5 minute video on why NASA is hiding the fact that the earth is flat without a gram of weed, but I'd probably watch one on why Corona isn't as bad as people are saying it is. As long as the resolution is decent quality and it's not some fat talkshow host who also thinks the government is putting chemical in the water to turn the frogs gay.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that frogs are BORN gay.</p>

        <p>As for my friends, I talk about jfk and how Isreal is the bad guy in the middle east imo and they just laugh it off as a joke, because I also make jokes as a way of coping with the fucked up world we live in. I won't go into why the US. Kicked thousands out of there rightfully owned homes simply because I, as a half hebrew, have been called a Nazi for sharing that information, but historically the chosen people of god sure do get shit on alot don't we? Egypt, constantinople, germany, pales- I mean Isreal. Yeah, always has been Isreal. Definitely.</p>
<p>There's an animated movie where humans have discovered alien societies in space, and have pretty much been accepted as a low class of sentient life by these disgusting monstrous aliens of all shapes as sizes. In the movie the idea that humans are basically the same as cockroaches is widely accepted, because humans have no home planet anymore. I agree with those aliens.</p>
