    <strong>The "Think Positive" Crowd Shames All Emotions About this or even Facing Reality</strong>
    <p><p>One thing I noticed is how people shamed me for my emotions. This is one reason I may have to change the circles I am in and one reason I want to move away from here. I wish I could convince my husband. I need real people with real emotions. There's times I consider just firebombing the sad non-existent social life I do have, and telling them all what I think. I stay quiet for safety right now, and not wanting to make "enemies". </p>
<p>I know something is going to break in me, once they start giving that would be prion experimental shots to their children. I even feel like unfriending some long distance friends over that,  I am not talking to them much lately.</p>
<p>Covid has ended so many friendships. Friends moved away. I got ghosted by the few I did try to warn. I can't talk to anyone here. Even sharing some "feelings" about all of this, I have been shut down more times than I can count. I have withdrawn inside. There is a feeling of "why bother" as I will get the same response.</p>
<p>The little bit of speaking out I have done has made me feel ostracized and the lost friends it has been too much.  I can't find any more real people anymore, all I got is these brainwashed people around me, and I feel "AFRAID" of them. Think about someone already autistic, where social stuff is hard enough, and all this made new rules, and seemed to turn this world into a hell of sorts. Don't talk, Don't think, Don't Question, is the mantra around here. I know some of you are living in different places and are around different people.. One unwritten rule around here is never to speak negatively about the Covid pandemic. It's weird. They seem to LIKE this, it creeps me out.</p>
<p>Middle class and above white people are so indoctrinated into the "be positive" mantra around here, they can't even look at reality when it's staring them in the face. I am on the lower economic end of things but live in an area that is more affluent, this fact has made them even more what some call NPCs and they have obeyed all this acting like it is okay, and it's that part I can't stand. </p>
<p>I used to write on a personal blog, how the "think positive" crap was going to ruin society. Look at all these people ignoring evidence of how bad things are staring them right in the face.</p></p>

        <p>Some random Facebook Karen shamed me just for commenting that I felt depressed during the lockdown. Not even that I thought covid was fake or anything, just that I was depressed. I think that was the moment I became redpilled because it pissed me off so much.</p>

        <p>That's sad. I think one reason more people are depressed is they cannot talk about it. They are told never to talk about real emotions and to save face and this separates people too. Every cult I have ever read about had rules of "keeping sweet" where you never complain, I think they did this to all of America.</p>

        <p>Acknowledging something is the first step I guess.</p>
<p>Totally get what you mean. However, I might call it differently instead of "be positive" Id call it "opportunistic". The idea is to make the best out of what you get.</p>
<p>So instead of even looking into whats happening or why or how, all they do is adapt to it, so to get ahead of the rest.</p>

        <p>I agree with trying to make the best of things. I plan to do things I enjoy later on, but the whole suppression of emotion, the acceptance of the unacceptable, has brought me some outrage. I question why am I here? Why am I around people like this? Is something wrong with me or is it them? I still try to enjoy what I can of life with husband but these people have disappointed me beyond measure. That part is hard to explain. They adapt but they don't question, I consider them part of the problem. They boil the frogs in the pot, and keep raising the temperature, and well you know what happens to the frog. I'm at the point of, don't throw pearls before swine, you are vulnerable now, protect yourself, but seeing what people have become, is not easy.</p>

        <p>I feel you.</p>
<p>I have come to terms that I cant speak to some people anymore, because I might lose it when they confront me with things such as trying to shame me into their stupidity. Im pretty big and buff, I cant lose my temper and let my anger rage free. But that might happen at some point, so I try not to give them the chance to get me there.</p>

        <p>I'm trying to "sneak things" in on people like subtle wake up calls. I sometimes have noticed in groups, when I skirt issues, and speak of totalitarianism or use other words for what is happening, some are agreeing with me. I wish I had been able to warn more of the vaxx, but I was slow to get on the ball and hadn't done my research yet [distracted by own life and health stuff] I know talking to some people is a waste of time. Most I am trying to bring new information too, there's more hope there. Yeah being a big and buff person, if you display anger it will be seen in a different way.</p>

        <p>I am one of those people who while they deconverted still respect Christ's words, and yes that is definitely on the list of things to remember. I think they are very profound too.</p>

        <p>The Cult of Positivity does real damage. I fucking hate "good vibes only" emotional regulator gatekeeping assholes who wear the mask of friendliness and "pro" when really they are deniers of truth and full human expression. They are TOXIC despite the pretense. Their vibes are BAD.</p>

        <p>I agree. It's all about silencing and controlling people too. I read this book which warned about the harm to come years ago. I don't know if this author is still alive but she wrote a book against the health care system and how they wanted to usurp life itself and make medical care into a religion. Ill post both.</p>

        <p>Can totally relate to this and I also went from trying to warn people, and being harshly criticized, to feeling like I can't really talk to anyone about it. I've had one friend tell me "leave me alone" and "I hardly even think about covid or vaccines".. only to get the vaccine a few weeks later. </p>
<p>I have had people tell me to "stop focusing on the negative", not so much "remain positive at all times". But, what can I say, it's a sinister time we're living through. Friends resorting to character insults in response to perfectly legitimate points I've made has helped me see that I didn't really need them in my life, and breathed a sign of relief at the idea of not seeing them anymore. </p>
<p>I keep thinking the real stories of how harmful these injections are is going to be seen by everyone, forgetting how censored most platforms are. They are perched smugly on their high-horses and it will take an overwhelming amount of evidence and horror before they ever admit the 'anti-vaxxers' were right. </p>
<p>I will say that having 1-2 people you can truly open up to/ talk to about this stuff is 1000x better than having none at all. Good luck with adjusting your circle of people and I wish you a satisfying and vindicating 'breaking point'. </p>

        <p>I feel like I can't talk to anyone safely, and I had some get angry saying they didn't want to hear talk about vaccines--in this case don't know if they got it or not but they have a lot on their plate. Yeah this time is sinister so why wouldn't we have negative to post on. I know i post winter oak on my Facebook, LOL no one comments, hope some are reading and waking up. I try to sneak stuff in, that may get someone to think, but that is not always easy. I wonder if some of the vaxxed have regrets surely after Fauci's nasty doings related to gain of function, a few inside in their heart of hearts have to be thinking WTF! What gets me is if they give this garbage to children, and if children die, and this is deemed acceptable then America truly will have lost it's soul. I believe it already has but that alone will be a horror show to me and I dread it. I think the injections are going to harm people, I hate that I may be worrying about the ticking time bomb of prions and everyone I care about who got the vaxx, this may sound terrible but I hope the results if they are going to come in a few years anyway, happen quicker so LESS people sign up for this garbage, and as few children as possible. I just wrote the ruling elites suck in no uncertain words on my FB so while I am not direct with things always anyone reading is going to pick up.  I am fortunate for the few online friends who see through this stuff. Thank you.</p>
