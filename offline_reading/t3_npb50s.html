        <p>This is the thing here I can't stand, I'm trans myself (still closeted outside the internet so take that as you will) and can't stand how most of the community eats up all this covid propaganda, mostly just because orange man bad. Sometimes when I see all this craziness I feel like I'm the only trans woman who can actually use their head. Wish my identity didn't have to be a partisan issue.</p>

        <p>The sad reality is we now have a generation of people raised on social media. As a result, many seem to have a twisted view of what is and is not acceptable in society.</p>
<p>Since so many seem to think your victimhood determines your value they’re trying to be the biggest victim and leaving destruction in their wake.</p>
<p>Combine this with the Trump Derangement Syndrome that hit when he won in 2016 and you have the world we live in today.</p>
<p>So now we have people who legitimately believe the worst thing that can happen to them is someone not fully and completely validating their chosen identity and they seem to think threatening people with suicide attempts, guilt trips and gaslighting is not only acceptable but encouraged.</p>
<p>I do feel sorry for you since you’re now linked to this shit.</p>

        <p>It's not so bad, I know despite my hyperbolic statement in my first part that plenty of us exist, for example, it made me very happy to see Caitlin Jenner running and seeing it relatively well received. It just doesn't seem like that because any time we speak up in our communities we get banned. (case in point, this account exists because in my (previous) main one got banned off a trans support/meme subreddit because I dared to say Trump was the better president, didn't insult anyone, even had a couple others respond and have a really friendly conversation about it, it seemed that was the greatest crime in their eyes)</p>

        <p>Trump wasn’t as bad as people said. Yeah, he was an asshole and opinionated but the shit he said was pretty mild compared to what some people are posing on Facebook under their real name with their employer listed in the profile and their whole family linked and identified.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because I grew up surrounded by shit talkers and bullies but I’m relatively immune to harsh words. What terrifies me is when someone is caught lying and doubles down since it shows me I can’t trust them at all. Sadly our leaders have repeatedly proven to be pathological liars.</p>

        <p>I rather liked him. He wasn't my dream president (Ron Paul) but he was a step in the direction I want to go. No matter who you support though (or if you don't support any of them) if you're still calling for lockdowns and mask mandates at this point of the game, you're just playing a silly virtue signaling game and you can fuck right off.</p>

        <p>I was just happy we finally had a President that at least pretended to care about the American people instead of a President that sends our money to foreign countries, sends our troops off to die in someone else’s war and all while our infrastructure is crumbling.</p>
<p>Biden’s just back to the same shit we were dealing with under Obama and we would have had for the last four years of Hilary won, but no one wants to talk about how “America first” is a bad thing.</p>
