        <p>People die from viruses.  Who knew?
Did you ever stop to ponder if you ever infected anyone with the flu virus that kills millions?  Did you ever wonder if we should shut down the world’s economy and make healthy people stay home?
Me neither.
BTW, President Trump made a full and speedy recovery and probably has lifetime immunity now.  I don’t know if Herman Cain was one of the rare 6% that died of COVID19, or one of the 94% that died from other things and just happened to have COVID19.  We will probably never know.</p>

        <p>How many patients did that Navy hospital ship receive when it docked in NY?
Also many hospitals remained virtually empty.  Some to the point of bankruptcy?
But those facts don’t fit the narrative so they aren’t reported.
My son was national guard and active during the “COVID19 pandemic here in RI”. They set up the convention center down town with multiple hospital beds and medical equipment for the overflow that never came.  The National Guard used those beds to sleep in when they had to pull duty during the BLM and ANTIFA riots.
You’ve been had.  It’s how grifters roll.  I mean it’s how the gooberment rolls.</p>

        <p>No sir, many hospitals went empty or close to it.  Some were closed down.  Some went bankrupt for being closed down so long.  Deemed non essential by tyrannical governors.  I have many family members that work in the medical field.  Just more stuff that’s true you won’t ever see in the fake news media.  Feel free to look it up.</p>

        <p>Anyone else feel like they have been watching a pandemic themed miniseries on TV?  I watched stories about people dying in the streets, not leaving their houses for days and days and then only venturing out for necessities, hospitals overrun with covid patients, ventilator shortages the list goes on and on. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only thing that really changed for my wife and I was we had to wear masks sometimes.  The kids obviously had it harder not being able to go to school. They loved it for the first few weeks but once that "snow day" mentality wore off and the lack of socialization started taking a toll they really started to hate it.  I see a lot of the public at work, go into 6 or more different homes every day, 6 days a week, and talked to plenty of people who got covid and recovered, but nobody had anyone die from it.  In fact the only people I've personally heard of dying were a friend of the family's mother who was in hospice with late stage breast cancer, she passed as expected but of course the cause of death was covid, and my daughter's friend's grandfather (89 years old..) who died, cause of death was of course covid but I don't know the family well enough to ask if there were other issues.  Every single person I've talked to that had covid or knew someone with it said it was no worse than a bad cold, and most of the people wouldn't have even known they had it if not for getting tested. </p>
<p>Most people I talk to (in real life, not on the internet) have had very similar experiences.  I just don't understand how people can ignore what they see themselves and just go along with what the TV is telling them.  I do get why people could have been scared at first, but after the 237821st dancing nurse video, multiple pictures and videos of the same officials telling us to mask up and socially distance ignoring their own rules, and the really weird coercion methods with the vaccine I figured more would think something is off.</p>

<p>The reality is that the fallen angels hate humanity and want to see it wiped out. They will do everything they can to turn our own technology and weapons against us until we're no more. Hence why the depopulation is part of the agenda for Bill Gates and the WEF.</p>

        <p>I worked in a nursing home for two years, and I saw a whole lot of elderly residents testing positive and ending up just fine, even while having severe health conditions already. So don't get me wrong, I completely understand that COVID in many cases is not worrisome at all. I'm also personally a witness to three people dying in unrelated circumstances while factually known to be COVID negative and still being categorized as having died of COVID on their death certificates, so I absolutely do recognize that deaths are being categorized falsely as well. I say this just to clarify where I'm coming from.</p>
<p>however, there's still the simultaneous issue that some people, somewhere, are out there dying in alarming ways for real. I don't know anyone personally who died in an uncommon way, but I've heard enough from others in direct proximity that I don't have the ability to write it off. There's also a lot of medical data out there, and it would require an increasingly large and unexplainable conspiracy in order for all of it to be totally false, so I would avoid writing it off completely if I didn't have to. Granted, I don't know what's causing these deaths, and I lean heavily toward psychogenic illness being a major factor myself, but either way, it's happening, to some extent, somewhere. So I think in some cases, there are gonna be some people who really do have justification for believing that COVID is truly worrisome.</p>
<p>of course, even still: even for these people, it's gotta be extremely rare, wouldn't you think? I must admit that whatever this wacky scheme is, it's definitely doing a good job at eluding comprehension, and it's definitely difficult to describe sufficiently with an explanatory model. I mean, I know it's bullshit overall. But <em>how the fuck is it even working?</em></p>

        <p>I wouldn't be surprised if the fear of covid is causing a lot of the symptoms, especially the "long haul" people.   That and the mental stress caused by isolation. This is like many things for me,  I think something isn't right. I can't really explain what exactly isn't right, but just comparing what I see in my day to day life vs what the news is saying something doesn't add up.  Just like the mass shooting in Las Vegas. It was one of the biggest mass shootings in US history, so you'd think it would be touted around as a need for more gun control, yet it was flushed down the memory hole.  How can that be?  People who want more gun control will latch on to ANY shooting as a reason, and yet they ignore one of the most deadly?  Why? </p>
<p>Everyone knows covid death numbers are inflated.  It's a joke "oh died in a car accident? you mean died of covid!". There shouldn't be any need to inflate the number of dead if covid is as bad as advertised.  One possible explanation is nursing homes / hospitals getting money for covid patients dying in their care?  But there's so many other questions.. </p>
<p>Why did Cuomo put covid positive people in nursing homes, which is where the most vulnerable people live? </p>
<p>If covid is so terrible, why the push to get vaccinated?  I can tell you that if I actually saw overrun hospitals and people around me dying I would be first in line to get a vaccine, experimental or not.  Instead we get nurses dancing on tik tok.  Doesn't make sense. </p>
<p>Why have viable treatments like ivermectin been pushed aside for vaccines that only have emergency use authorization?  There is just about no harm in trying ivermectin, and from what I've seen it works well for not only making the symptoms milder but also as a preventative.  Again, doesn't make sense. </p>
<p>Why have we seen, time and time again, the people in charge breaking their own rules for masks, social distancing and lockdowns?  If things were really as bad as they say, wouldn't they want to do everything they possibly can to not get sick? One more time, doesn't make sense. </p>
<p>I don't have the answers, maybe it is some grand conspiracy, maybe it's just a money grab.  What I do know is there are too many things that don't make sense for me to just blindly go along with what we are being told.   I don't doubt that covid is a real virus, and I'm sure there are people who have died from it but I don't think the numbers we are being given are accurate.  I could be wrong, in fact I'd rather be wrong and find out that we aren't being fed a bunch of BS.</p>

        <p>Funny,  on my last doctors checkup he asked me if I got the jab yet.  I told him I had a C.S. exemption.  He asked what C.S. meant?  Told him I had a common sense disorder that wouldn’t allow me to get unapproved experimental injections.  And the rest of the appointment went downhill from there.  Anyone know a good M.D. who practices in the state of Rhode Island?</p>

        <p>So I have been to a doctor's office and now the ER over an issue I'm having for the past few weeks. I think it's pretty serious but just get antibiotics and sent on my way. I haven't improved and possibly feel worse. Both asked if I've been vaxxed and once they find out that I'm not, they stay their distance literally and they try to rush me out. My 4 hour hospital visit started with 2 tests that I was lead to from the waiting room. I was given a room after almost 4 hours to then have a doctor come in and tell me what he thought was wrong with me and what he prescribed and discharged with 15 minutes of getting in my room. I'm doing my best to not be another "Covid" death, but not sure what to do at this point.</p>

        <p>Yeah, don’t have any advice for you.  Common sense would suggest that if they are “vaxed” they’d be immune in the case you had COVID19.  It seems to me like a vast majority of the medical community is hypnotized.  But on that same doctors visit I last had the woman who took my vitals also admitted that she wasn’t vaxed.  She wanted me to keep it on the down low though as the rest of the office got the jab.</p>
