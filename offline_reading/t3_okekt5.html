    <strong>Banned from grandmother's 95th birthday by Stanford professor for j@b status</strong>
    <p><p>My uncle, Bob [using fake names] is a professor at Stanford, and the head of his department. During the crisis, we've had multiple family gatherings. Before the j@b came out, these were done with masks, distanced, with an overabundance of caution, but I put up with it because I wanted to see my family, and I genuinely enjoy spending time with them besides this issue.</p>
<p>However, since everyone stopped fearing the needle as an evil Trump creation, things have changed. My aunt (Bob's wife) wouldn't let me sit at the same table last time people came over, making me sit at a little table attached to it - despite the fact that I cooked the food without a mask or gloves, which seemed to not bother anyone in the slightest. I have not been allowed to hug my grandmother or stand next to people not in my nuclear family at these events. I put up with this for my sister's birthday, before she went off to another state for a job, but I said that I would not be treated as a second-class citizen afterwards.</p>
<p>My father and uncle started planning my grandmother's 95th birthday party a while back. Suddenly, everyone got an email from Bob that it would be at his house, and he told my dad that I would have to be distanced if I didn't get it. My grandmother separately emailed me to ask why I'm not getting it yet, but she is just expressing her care for us, and she has taken good care of her health in general. But my uncle wouldn't even schedule a phone call, barely replied to some of my emails, and couldn't explain why me getting the j@b would help protect anyone, when they already have it. And remember - this man is a professor at Stanford, and not a low ranking one either. He should be skeptical, open to new ideas, and a good listener, just to be considered for any academic position there. But, now weeks after he last responded to me, there has been no show of good faith, no willingness to talk on the phone with me. So unless I submit to being treated as if I am a danger to my own family or get an experimental injection, I'm not going to my last remaining grandparent's 95th birthday.</p>
<p>Beyond the content of the requests, I am no "super-spreader" - I'm young and healthy, my college is online, I see few people who won't be there and none who are not vaccinated, I'm clean (including food hygiene to a professional level from cooking at boarding school), and I'm quite good at dealing with stress and living healthily. Nor am I an idiot or science-denier, as I do quite well academically (even by Stanford professors' standards) and read a variety of subjects. The issue is, this man, much of my family, and a large part of the People's Republic of California don't care how much you can prove yourself not to be a risk - they only care about whether you follow the currently in vogue "solution" to disease.</p>
<p>I wanted to share this with you because mine is a rather extreme version of this quite common situation, with someone who should be the most equipped to doubt the narrative and tolerate a disobedient person instead choosing fear and disgust at his own nephew.</p></p>
