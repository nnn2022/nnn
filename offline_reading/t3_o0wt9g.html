    <strong>My girlfriend is alone in the middle of a COVID-crazy family.</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys! I just wanted to share my love life in the midst of the pandemic. </p>
<p>I'm 17 years old and I have a girlfriend who is also 17 years old and we're long distance. As of the moment- in a few months- I'll be moving a bit closer to her so seeing her will be an much more common opportunity. However- she's alone with her immediate family. She's the only one NOT paranoid about COVID and will not be getting the vaccination but her mother is very PARANOID and is possibly getting the vaccination along with the rest of her family. The good thing is- her mom respects her decision to not get it and won't force it- the bad thing is that she's still trapped in that house with people who go coo-coo for COVID and until we're old enough to move out- that will remain so. Keep in mind that I found and am dating girl that is truly awake about how the world is and how COVID is bullshit. She's a keeper for me. I don't care if we're this young. It's hard find a girl let alone a PERSON this young who is a COVID skeptic and vaccine hesitant. I'll not fuck this up because then I'll be left with a sea of normies if I do. </p>
<p>I'm not worried about her getting the vaccine. We both made a vow not to and promised not to because we both simply don't trust it, especially after I informed her about the concerns of fertility. After that- she vowed never to get it and to always say no when offered no matter what. As of the moment- she's sick and her family is making her get a test to which I'm okay with- as long as it's not the vaccine. </p>
<p>I just wanted to share this because I know one emotion out there that is hard to come by for us skeptics is love. I wanted to let you know that there is love out there for us and that it still exists. Never let go of your love for all- be the bigger and better person amongst a world of those are populated with those who seek to hate those who never follow. Don't give up in finding connections my friends- whether it's your family- a friend- or dating. If you want someone- you'll find someone. If you want peace- you'll get peace. If you find joy- make sure you cherish it and keep it if you can. </p>
<p>So- what do you guys think? Any advice for us? Any advice for me? I honestly do find it a bit difficult to be in this situation. She doesn't like being stuck with her COVID crazy family either but at least she's able to maintain her medical autonomy and refuse the vaccination no matter what happens. </p>
<p>This subreddit has been one of the nicest places in the world. Even so- that I can share my love life with ya'll. Peace!</p></p>

        <p>Good for you man. If possible, consider a life together out in the countryside. If my intuition is correct, I fear that life in the cities will not be good at all. A rural agrarian lifestyle may be the path to a fruitful and long-lasting future.</p>

        <p>Good, as long as the vaccine is not forced there's always choices. Support her in sticking to her guns, show her the data here every time the pressure builds up and tries to make her buckle, because it will.</p>
<p>Other than that you already seem wise for your years and on the right track. Yes, stay in love and forgiveness, and don't stoop the hatred of those against your choice. </p>
<p>Getting close to God in prayer will help guide you. Thanks for sharing and peace!</p>

        <p>Thanks man! And I'm sure she won't buckle! She stayed defiant against her mom when she wanted her to wear a mask and she denied- her mom respecting her decision not to. The effects on fertility was more than enough to convince her.</p>

        <p>Try to hang tight until you guys are 18, then get married and find a place together (<em>in that order</em>), ideally out in the countryside, but even if you end up in an apartment, you can still choose wisely—picking a place within walking distance of a field or forest nobody will mind you using for a small plot of vegetables.</p>

        <p>I guess I don't have special advice, I just wanted to say you seem like you have your head on straight and I think you're right to value this girl as highly as you do. Both of you, stay strong. Sane people look mad in an insane world; keep pursuing truth. You seem like good people and I really wish you both the best, from the bottom of my heart. Keep talking about things together, and seeking new information and depth of perspective.</p>

        <p>My advice is to hold onto her and marry her once you two are ready for the commitment. It is hard to find love in a time like this, but it’s possible. Thanks for sharing your story. It gives me hope, as a 26-yr-old perpetually single girl. I’ll find a man who is unafraid of covid and what the government/society thinks of him. Hopefully sometime soon. On the plus side, this whole situation has created the easiest way to tell who is compatible with me and who isn’t. It’ll save a lot of hassle when looking for someone to potentially date. Best of luck!</p>

        <p>I doubt it. If she isn't getting the vaccination then I'm sure I'll be alright. Besides- if her mom and the rest of her family get it- then they should be protected from either of us from the sickness. </p>

        <p>I mean it sounds like they're cool with her not being vaccinated so no reason to stress.  I'm more curious, how do you have a long distance relationship at 17...how did you meet?  And are you moving with your parents to be closer to her, or by yourself.  I'd maybe be more concerned if you're uprooting your life at 17 and moving for a girl.</p>
