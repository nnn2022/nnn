    <strong>#DissolveFacebook</strong>
    <p><p>Had an epiphany..   For ALL the companies who pushed the propaganda and CENSORED those with information conflicting with the popular narrative at a time of a dire world crisis: those companies must be dissolved as propagandists and labeled as conspirators of war crimes.  Their assets must be liquidated and distributed to several third party- full transparency firms in which the public has access to view income, disbursements, and expenses and ALL assets must be distributed to the people affected starting with fatal and adverse reaction victims of the vaccines.  These companies willingly withheld data and censored information that effected public health which makes them criminals of biological warfare.  Those in charge of these propaganda machines must be charged accordingly as profiteer traitors and criminals of war.  I say this including the mod who reads this and down throttles it because itâ€™s your job.. fuck you the most</p></p>
