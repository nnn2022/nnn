    <strong>Post-election predictions?</strong>
    <p><p>The lockdowns and mask arguments are clearly motivated by politics. It’s so clear that they’re being used as a backdrop for the 2020 election (I won’t go as far as saying it’s specifically to undermine Trump, but given the media’s allegiances, that’s just how they’re using it). By having this backdrop, the public is all distracted.</p>
<p>But what about afterwards? My prediction lately is that once the election is over, the media will stop talking about coronavirus. Since the fear all comes from that one source, people will soon get over it. It happened briefly during the George Floyd riots. The media completely forgot about lockdowns and such to talk about racial justice.</p>
<p>I predict something similar will happen Nov 4th and beyond. The media will be busy discussing the election results, why people voted the way they did, and what this means for the country. Just like the big race war, they’ll have no time to discuss covid. Only this time, it’ll be gone for good. In time, covid consciousness will vanish, and local officials will reopen their economies in full. After all, movie theaters, conventions, concerts, and sports are really important to maintaining the consumerist status quo. We can’t keep up this sedentary culture either. It’s extremely cringe and almost LARPy. We’re not living in the Hollywood apocalypse like we thought we were 5 months ago. Everyone is tired of hearing “these unprecedented times” and commercials with people talking on Zoom.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>I don't know. I think there's more at work here than just politics. I think a lot of big pharma stands to make billions of of this thing. I don't think the election necessarily ends it as much as people just say fuck it and move on anyway.</p>

        <p>I'm legitimately betting that the election will be the start of civil war in the streets and that local governments will remove all pretenses of lockdowns being about stopping the coronavirus and use them to suppress the side the local leadership disagrees with. Watch it happen. They already selectively allow BLM protests over Trump, anti-lockdown or religious rallies in many parts of the country.</p>
<p>And the covid crap isn't going to disappear if a vaccine comes in this year; they'll shove their PR campaign down their throats to force people to get it whether it's viable, safe or not, and that will be life as we roll into 2021. And I really, REALLY hope I get to start working from home before then, because if they really do decide to go full no-jab no-job, that's when I'm going to cash out my savings and quit society completely. Fuck that hot noise. I'm no anti-vaxxer, but there's no way in hell a vaccine made in a few months can be reasonably safe and all it will do is validate the Alex Joneses of the world, and that's the one time when you'll catch me saying better-safe-than-sorry.</p>

        <p>I don't think that will happen at all. We may live in a dystopia, but it's a <em>boring</em> dystopia. The elites don't want us panicking. They'd rather we enjoy our Marvel movies and sportsball. That's America, baby. And boy do they want to get back to that.</p>

        <p>They certainly don’t want what’s best for us, but they also don’t want us aware of what’s going on. For example, the lockdown politics is being turned up to 11 so they can drown out the riots.</p>

        <p>In my personal opinion, I think trump is waiting until after the election to condemn these corrupt governors and do something about them. If he does it now, his poll numbers will only drop, because the majority of the population will think that trump wants them dead because they are fear mongered and misinformed about the virus on a daily basis. Once he wins, he will take immediate action against these governors and remove them for violating constitutional rights for the people and abusing emergency powers. But that’s just my theory. Some people will disagree and that’s fine, but the way trump has been talking about the virus, I don’t think this conclusion is too far fetched.</p>

<p>I disagree. More people hate this than you think. It may feel like everyone's against us but the average person is only wearing a mask because it's a social obligation, and quite literally nothing more.</p>

        <p>Politics is part of the mix, but lock downs and masks aren't just happening in the US. They are happening all over the world. So while in the US, certainly politics does motivate some of the pro lock down/mask people, but there is more to it than just the US presidential election.</p>

        <p>is it possible other countries are taking cues from the US? This might be a cope, but during the BLM shit there were anti-racism demonstrations worldwide, even in countries with little to no black population. I certainly see your point of view though. I haven't researched or paid attention to the spread itself in months, so I've basically viewed everything through a political lens.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. I don’t believe the Covid talk will 100% disappear on Nov 4, but the election and other issues will dominate the news cycle, and it will eventually fade away. Certain leaders may try to hold on to restrictions a bit longer, but over time public opinion will turn to getting back to the old normal, and other stories will dominate the news cycle.</p>

        <p>You are totally 100% right on the money. This thing will dwindle away quickly once the election is over. The rest of the world is going along as they have much to gain by a more left-leaning, global-economy-minded U.S. government. I think a vaccine will suddenly be available near the end of the calendar year (wow! What a conference!) And big pharma will make hand over fist from all the morons who run out to get it thinking "yay! I'm cured!"because they have no clue how viruses actually work (not to mention ignoring the fact that they've been carrying the damn thing for 10 months already with zero illness). Meanwhile, all the damn mask companies and whoever came up with those stupid ass customizable "please wait here" stickers that adorn every cashier's counter in America will have taken all their gazillions and will be sitting pretty. The economy will start to improve organically as the tourism and entertainment industries rebound, and Biden will take credit for reviving the economy.</p>

        <p>I feel or you, but hang in there. It won't be much longer. I guarantee it. The media and government can only fool all these sheep for so long. People will eventually start feeling the pinch of the screwed economy. Once the election happens, no matter who wins, this non-stop money printing, stimulus checks and other means of temporarily and artificially propping up the economy will go away and reality will set it. Then all of a sudden, COVID won't be anyone's main concern anymore. Trust me.</p>

<p>The only reason the democrat governors like Newsolini, and the democrat and far leftist senators/congresspeople and media/entertainment are all pushing the propoganda is to try to gain leverage in the election. It's no coincidence their handling of it was so authoritarian during an important election year. They wanted to destroy the economy Trump rebuilt.</p>
<p>They'll either stop if Biden wins because they will have won and will spread a "rebuild" agenda which will make the virus "disappear", or they'll give up because Trump got re-elected and will focus efforts into trying to push a political narrative for 2024</p>
<p>Either way I don't see covid agenda going past December</p>

        <p>That's my take for the most part. I don't think it's a grand anti-Trump conspiracy though. He isn't really a threat to the establishment... It's more that they wanted a fake political issue the masses could chew on til election day, and the naturally the left's job was to use it against Trump.  </p>
<p>Regarding if Biden wins, that sounds exactly like what they'll do. My guess if Trump wins is that they'll use covid as a smearing device when he holds post-election rallies. But other than that the result will be the same. Corona bye-bye.</p>

        <p>I think you underestimate how far gone these lunatics are.  If Trump wins, they'll double down to punish us for being heretics and stopping them from achieving their communist utopia. If their guy wins, they'll have free reign to do whatever they want to us. We'll all be handy scapegoats for anything that doesn't pan out in their insane plans for the world. These aren't misled but ultimately good hearted people; they're in the street burning buildings, attacking people with impunity, and chanting 'death to America', or else are funding and protecting their comrades who are boots on the ground. All that built up hate and disdain isn't going to suddenly evaporate after the election.</p>

        <p>The election won't end this stuff. Why would it? I don't get the logic. Trump wins - well, he doesn't give a fuck about lockdowns, America, or anything but himself. Biden wins - he'll do whatever the DNC puppet show tells him.</p>
<p>I highly doubt anything will ever reopen ever again. We'll be in this half-life hell forever. We'll have more rioting, more burning, looting, worldwide madness, but we'll still be under lockdown and in America, unable to practice our civil rights because the majority of this nation believe they are things that can be removed from us by government.</p>

        <p>Trust me, that won't happen. All the current civil unrest was accidental. It was supposed to end around mid to late-June when BLM support was at its all-time high. The intent was to spin a racial justice narrative, and gaslight conservatives into believing they were alone in opposing BLM. But the rioting couldn't be controlled, and now many people are openly stating they're sick of the unrest.  </p>
<p>Anyways, as I said in the post, the lockdowns are the backdrop for the election. It's mostly just political popcorn to keep "the masses" entertained. I think the initial reaction to covid was reasonable given how uncertain things were, but it's clear now that we're taking things too far. However, the potential for D&amp;C was too good to pass up for 2020. Elites definitely hate election years because they make people politically conscious. Remember when immigration and healthcare were the issues this election? Yeah, I don't either. Once this election is over, we'll all go back to not paying attention to the news, and they'll have no choice but to let us go back to our lives. Imagine having a lockdown <em>without</em> 24/7 political drama to keep you busy.</p>
