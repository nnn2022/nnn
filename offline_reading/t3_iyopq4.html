    <strong>“Before mass leaders seize the power to fit reality to their lies, their propaganda is marked by its extreme contempt for facts as such, for in their opinion fact depends entirely on the power of man who can fabricate it.”</strong>
    <p><p>A fitting quote by Hannah Arendt as to what is happening right now.   Governments worldwide are ignoring easily verifiable facts about Covid.  The reality of a very survivable virus for most of us has been twisted into a gas lit fog of deception and lies that wants people to give up their humanity for the promise of safety.</p></p>

        <p>200,000 ppl and counting, with the president conducting a misinformation campaign within the White House, you are in the minority. It was simple dude wear a mask and mitigate a virus that spreads via droplets, it’s not tough to understand, but we’re past that point. Since the virus wasn’t mitigated it lends to all these conspiracy theories.</p>

        <p>&rt;What is the percentage of 200,000 out of 300 plus million?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;From the WHO : <em>"</em><strong><em>To date, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this type of aerosol route has not been demonstrated</em></strong><em>; much more research is needed given the possible implications of such route of transmission."</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So if that is the case then blaming people who weren't wearing mask is misguided at best and a complete assumption based on little evidence if any.<br>
