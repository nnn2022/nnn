    <strong>The point of lockdowns</strong>
    <p><p>We know for a fact that there is a <strong>massive</strong> propaganda campaign going on online and on MSM. We’ve seen countless of examples of bots re-posting the same messages, we know that thousands of <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/05/1064622">Covid-19 influencers</a> have been hired to shape public opinion, we know that mass censorship of dissenting opinion is occurring, and we know that MSM is very obviously pushing a narrative.</p>
<p>We also know that lockdowns don't work. Or, I should rather say they don’t do much to achieve what their implied objective is. There are numerous <a href="https://dailysceptic.org/2021/04/15/seven-peer-reviewed-studies-that-agree-lockdowns-do-not-suppress-the-coronavirus/">studies</a> concluding so, and we also have a real world example in Sweden that lockdown restrictions in fact don’t or at best have a marginal effect on the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>However, lockdowns do in fact work very well. This might appear to contradict my previous paragraph, but it really doesn’t. They are, as a matter of fact, very effective for the purpose they are being incorporated for.</p>
<p>Look at this from the government’s POV. They want to create a narrative, and they want to instill that narrative into the minds of a certain percentage of the population. What is the government <strong>unable</strong> to control? They cannot control human interaction in the real world, so they shut down restaurants, pubs and bars – all of them places where people congregate and communicate openly, exchange ideas, form opinions, and reach conclusions. They forbid gatherings, they put you under house arrest, they severely limit the social aspect of being human. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFQRjB1yPMo">They even insist that you don’t start up conversations with others</a>. The objective? Funnel the flow of information through channels that can be filtered and controlled.</p>
<p>What is the government <strong>able</strong> to control? The government has huge control, as evidenced by the past year and a half, over all aspects of digital communication. Technology has blessed us with sophisticated AI that is being actively weaponized and used to swarm forums, social media and message boards, obviously pushing an agenda. Governments also possess the resources to employ thousands of people to join in and contribute to the cause. </p>
<p>Naturally, all of this leads to a significant number of people being indoctrinated and conditioned into going along with all of this. They open up their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter profiles, and they see this faux bot-infested, pro-restriction, fearmongering majority. They do their due "research" on Google, only to stumble upon nothing but fact checkers and 'approved' content, furthering their confirmation bias. Some are gullible and fall for it straight away. Others have reservations about it but in the end, the primitive instinct to “keep with the tribe”, combined with fear, kick in and they ultimately also fall for it.</p>
<p>So, we’re up against three separate things here – bots, people being paid to push the agenda, and people who were simply conditioned into going along with all of this. If we find a way to reliably discern between those three groups and focus our efforts on the third, I think we’d have a higher chance of winning more people over.</p>
<p>Finally, to whoever has read thus far – I hope you’re having a lovely day. Even if we don’t share similar views and don’t all agree on everything, that’s okay, because we’re human after all, and that is the whole point of it – communicate with each other, share ideas and reach our own conclusions. And that is what has been taken away from us.</p></p>
