    <strong>President Biden's current plan will show if Governor DeSantis is truly on our side or a fraud.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure everyone here is aware of President Biden's rhetoric <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/us/politics/biden-vaccines.html">a couple days ago about the "door-to-door" vaccine plan</a> due to failing to reach 70% on July 4th (only 67%). Although some people say "you can always say no", I will say, "for now."</p>
<p>If DeSantis is the hero we  think he is and actually cares about fighting the evil globalists then he will never let the bastards go door to door with an injection that is less than a year old and already has caused more problems than the Swine Flu vaccine failure of 1976. Also confirmed myocarditis and other bad side effects by the CDC themselves.</p>
<p>I know the general advice is to not worship politicians, but even people in here call DeSantis a hero and hopes that he becomes president in 2024. After the first half of 2021 and DeSantis being awesome, he (and Florida) are seen as the last beacon of hope (with occasionally Texas as well). Please don't disappoint :(</p>
<p>Fingers crossed.</p></p>

        <p>Read the text of sb 2006. It's the bill that banned covid passports. Go to line 1107. It states: 
"If the individual poses a danger to the public health, the State Health Officer may subject the individual to isolation or quarantine. If there is no practical method to isolate or quarantine the individual, the State Health Officer may use <em>any means necessary</em> to vaccinate or treat the individual."</p>

        <p>Yep, most people have been unaware about this. Even though it might be mostly for hospitals, there's no reason it can't be extrapolated to schools, stadiums, etc.</p>

        <p>Sure, but how will they prove you are a 'danger to public health', as not engaging in medical treatment doesn't automatically prove that.</p>
<p>At this point, in a (allegedly) free and civil society, only a doctor with a court order can deem you as a danger to others, and have the force of Law behind them to take measures to restrict or treat you.</p>

        <p>It's going to be 'hard sell' tactics.</p>
<p>They will come to your door and ask you about your medical status, which of course is none of their business.</p>
<p>If you answer no to vax , they will then execute 'eliminate all objections!" sales tactics and basically argue with you trying to convince you to change your mind.</p>
<p>At the least, if you do participate, they will gather information on you, your attitude, your 'reasons/excuses', etc to enter into their database. They may go so far as to ask if others in the household are vaccinated, how many live there, their ages, etc</p>
<p>Probably best to not participate at all.</p>

        <p>Yeah I'll feel utterly betrayed if this was the case. I'm not surprised about other governors doing bullshit measures, but DeSantis had been constantly awesome the first half of 2021, even holding that roundtable conference with scientists that YouTube had been constantly censoring, and constantly fighting off the media hate similar to Trump in 2020, along with florida winning the cruise lawsuit.</p>
