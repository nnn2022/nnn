    <strong>Lets Liberate/ Time to COLLECTIVELY take action.</strong>
    <p><p>I believe assange was a key stone in uncovering/destroying this system. It can still be achieved without him, but i think it will take a little longer. </p>
<p>Im actively researching, collecting and posting evidence across all my social medias almost daily to spread the word that we must resist and stand up. If you read this, please consider saving many posts/photos from this sub directly to your camera roll and maybe even r/conspiracy if you feel brave enough to separate truth from fiction. But if we stay silent nothing happens, not a lot of "normies" use reddit so please take that action upon yourself. </p>
<p>Dont let your ego tell you otherwise either, i believe this is the right thing to do. Spread the good word, spread the information we have collected here. You are the frontline of this movement within this sub, we are one of many thinking grounds. Embrace the fact you are now apart of a resistance and lets now begin what all resistances do... fighting back. </p>
<p>Wake up your fellow Instagram users, your fellow snapchat users. It may take time, but post consistently, and along a same narrative that this lockdown is bullshit and is directly benefitting a small group of people. I have many many good images that can be used if you wish. Comment below and i will send you a imgur link.</p>
<p>Nobody else is going to do it for us, you've seen what the government have done! they certainly arent going to do it. And if they do, there will be no accounting for what they have done, there will be no justice. So it can begin right this second, this very moment we could collectively start the great awakening. Or it could be in a months time, but you must understand it comes from within us to make this change, no "Christ figure" is coming to save us. That's is why so many "q" operatives were destroyed when Trump didn't drain the swamp. Trump is also a political puppet and simply used the Q movement as leeway in office. Thats why no movement should be attached to one specific leader. Its all the people, for all the people. Trump is in the pedo club himself, lets not forget this satanic shit is very very real. But right this second is not important, once the general population can realise this lockdown is a hoax and simply fear control. We can then begin addressing and questioning more "disturbing matters".</p>
<p>Happy liberating my fellow patriots. Love and peace from the UK &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p></p>
