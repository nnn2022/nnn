    <strong>History is repeating.</strong>
    <p><p>So many similarities from history are going on. </p>
<p>Banning certain people from stores, transport etc. Now its those who don't wear masks, and soon to be those who are not vaccinated. </p>
<p>Shops that are non essential are closed. </p>
<p>The scariest part about it are the people. The people who are turning on those who can't wear a mask.</p>
<p>"Lock them up" </p>
<p>"get them outside and give them a beating" </p>
<p>"cough on them"</p>
<p>"Deny them medical care"</p>
<p>"I hope they die"</p>
<p>Are a few of the common things that are said about those who do not wear masks, and soon to be said about those who do not get vaccinated. </p>
<p>Also, being thought of as heroic for doing such negative things like name calling, publicly shaming, abusing innocent people.</p>
<p>You can see exactly how there would be so many people in agreement to ship them all off to a town/street on their own, sending them food in because you cant starve them, but don't want them walking around stores you walk around.  Then finally cheering the police on as they load them onto trains out of the area completely. 
Where they are sent, they won't really care as long as they are no longer a public health threat. 
Anyone who does worry about where they might be sent, and might try to help them will be shamed and shunned. </p>
<p>You might think it sounds a bit ridiculous to compare this to then, but the similarities are too eerily similar to ignore. 
Especially when the Canadian document even states that camps are the end result for those who refuse to be vaccinated.</p></p>

        <p>Unfortunately humans are dumb. They’re the same people who would say about Nazis “how could they have ever gone along with this and let that happen?” while simultaneously calling the cops on their neighbours for having friends over.</p>
<p>We always think we’re more advanced than our predecessors and in many ways we are, but this is absolutely a classic case of history repeating itself. And it’ll keep happening. Sadly, people are greedy and power hungry while the lower class is gullible and fearful.</p>

        <p>Yes and no. The more unhinged elements are that way, but Reddit and social media isn't the real world. The average person is fed up with this crap. They just want to live their lives and take reasonable precautions. As usual, the authoritarians are pushing too hard and too fast. The backlash is growing and more politicians are waking up to that fact.</p>

        <p>There has been a tremendous amount of tribalism that has been stoked in order to get the public behind the lockdowns. An already polarized climate (at least in the USA) has been made all the more so.</p>
<p>The irony is that the pro-lockdowneers/maskers are complicit in the totalitarian restriction of their lives because they are convinced that such restrictions will save peoples' lives! One would hope that wishing death on those who do not comply would occasion some cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>But, emotionally, the lockdowners and maskers are worn down. That's why they are lashing out. Their hate is a result of the lockdowns, of the constant messaging from the media.</p>

        <p>This is a time of great awakening. I've known the truth about humanity for almost 30 years now. It took a while to realize things though. Cognitive dissonance. People are blind and frankly stupid because everything they know has been taught to them by blind and stupid people. Only a few have the capacity to see things for what they are and usually it takes some great personal tragedy in order for someone to open their eyes.</p>
<p>People believe in fairytales. But the world has not changed and the people have not changed. The only thing that has changed is us - the few people who have their eyes open. The only thing that has changed is that now we can see what's actually real. It's no wonder we are so hated because the truth is we are all slaves living in a prison. Of course the blinded don't want to hear about it. It's like the Plato's cave.</p>
