    <strong>I don't think vaccines will be mandated (in the US), and here's why</strong>
    <p><p>I have a small list of reasons why I don't think vaccines will be mandated in the US (or probably anywhere in North America in general). I know some of you are worried that it may happen, and I have a little bit of worry too, but I'm confident that it won't happen for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's still EUA, and isn't known for sure whether they will be FDA-approved or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By mandating vaccines, they would need to remove all liability protection. All vaccines have had liability protection in the US since 1986, and will continue to have that protection until at least 2024. All vaccines are currently voluntary use. Surely, if they were required, there would be no liability protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be virtually impossible (if not completely impossible) to enforce. Too many people would protest. Too many people would try and get religious exemptions. Too many people would try and claim they medically can't get vaccines. They already can't completely enforce masks even in places where they are mandated, so how could they with vaccines?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CDC just admitted the vaccine doesn't block transmission at all. Therefor, I can see some (but not all) officials being opposed to mandatory vaccines, as they aren't benefitting anyone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's not to say certain business won't try to mandate vaccines, as they already have, but I can't see them being widely mandated here like they are in countries like Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. So I don't think we should be worrying too much.</p></p>

<p>Well they’re already saying it’s legal to mandate federal employees. That’s a step in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>This is how it's happening. Just like the the US gov't using social media companies to skirt 1A violations, they will use private business to avoid constitutional questions about vax mandates and vax passports.</p>

        <p>I'm not getting one.  But I have a lot of family and friends who have been vaccinated.  I'm hoping Novavax is approved for them as a booster.</p>
<p>Does anyone else think it would be less harmful?  The Novavax works like old school vaccines and doesn't do any of that DNA gene programing stuff.  I love my vaccinated family and friends and want a good booster for them.  I'm not taking anything because I had Covid and recovered (was like seasonal flu that I get every other year, and I have never had a Flu shot- ever).</p>
<p>So I will never get vaccinated.  But I am hoping better vaccines become available for my loved ones.</p>

        <p>That one seems the least sketchy to me.</p>
<p>It’s a protein vaccine like the one for HPV, which I got over a decade ago with no known issues. But I still don’t want any of them.</p>

        <p>You'll find novavax actually isn't a traditional vaccine. Please look further into it.</p>

        <p>There’s too many loopholes. The legal support of employers and businesses mandating vaccines for their employees and clientele is basically the same difference, even if they don’t officially mandate it on a government/legal level. </p>
<p>In other words, they don’t need to threaten to physically hold you down and force Pfizer juice into your body, they’ll just make sure you can’t buy groceries, go to school, or support your family without  it. </p>
<p>Otherwise, you can be completely vax free if you grow your own food and live rent-free on a vaxxed person’s property, which <em>anyone</em> can do and isn’t the <em>least</em> bit discriminatory or alienating!</p>
