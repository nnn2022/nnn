    <strong>Let your local businesses know that they will loose your patronage if they adopt vaccine passports</strong>
    <p><p>The flurry of social engineering is pressing people so hard to share how enthusiastic they are about getting their jabs that it may appear to businesses that everybody will ultimately get vaccinated and as such, vaccine passports are a no brainer to get their business fully reopened. We must be pro-active in our communication and counter this perception by letting our local businesses know that if they adopt vaccine passports they will lose our patronage. A good tactic I found for those who have the chance to live in place where businesses are partially opened is to leave a note at the bottom of the tab such as: "Please don't require vaccine passports so we can come back again. Thanks you :-)".</p>

<p>Let's be proactive and not let businesses believe that vaccine passports will be a win for them! What other communication tactics do you have in mind?</p></p>
