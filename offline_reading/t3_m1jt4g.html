    <strong>A city here in Brazil is making covid patients use a bracelet. If they refuse, they are fined. Why are people allowing that?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't watch the news. It's only fear porn after fear porn. But my mom was watching it and I saw for a brief moment a city here in Brazil is making all the patients wear two kind of bracelets. A yellow one if they're waiting for the test and red if it's positive. If they dare to take it out by themselves they face a fine. 
And people are fucking okay with this! How, why?
It's not happening here where I live but maybe it's just a matter of time. Is it happening anywhere else in the world?
This is so disgusting. People being treated like criminals or walking bio weapons. The worst of all is that people know it's wrong, they feel there's something wrong, but they refuse to stand against it. And now the nazi police decides to take their money because they refuse to be treated like trash.
Sometimes it feels like they deserve it. They deserve all the shit that comes out of this draconian measures because if they're willing to simply give up their freedom so easily, without an ounce of resistance, then they suffer the consequences of it. 
Heartbreaking how people are not willing to fight against tyranny here. They're too busy watching news talking shit about the president, even though he's right.</p></p>

        <p>It never began for me because I flat out refuse to wear the mask or anything. </p>
<p>I’m also a huge fan of confronting bullies and this year has been amazing for that. </p>
<p>People know me here and know better than to start something.</p>
<p>I’ve even been asked to not tell others they don’t have to wear a mask while grocery shopping. </p>
<p>Guess what? I told more, and I expanded it to other stores in more chains. </p>
<p>Anyone can do it.</p>

        <p>Just wait.  Now that Lula is cleared they'll put him in charge again.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro is one of the only covid skeptical leaders in the world. Once he's gone it's mandatory vaccine and detention centers for anyone sick.</p>

        <p>I don't think he's gonna be in charge again. Despite everything many people know Lula is a criminal.
And yes, you're right. Bolsonaro knows this whole plandemic is bullshit, but the media are so good in manipulating they're making him look like someone worse than Hitler.</p>
