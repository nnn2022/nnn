        <p>That I disagree with. I think we all can see that the storm systems these days are worse than in past years and way more destructive. The while island of Puerto Rico for goodness’ sake, storms in Texas and Florida, I’ve never seen anything like these in my lifetime. And yes that is the most obvious sign of climate change for us who don’t live in the Arctic or other cold area where ice has been melting and is affecting and threatening their lives and that of animals and ecosystems.</p>

<p>Nope, just reported as worse. No quantifiable data suggests anything is worse in any way. "The Storms are worse!" Is the easiest media narrative to debunk.</p>
<p>Here is a video released a couple days ago by a guy I follow that has a moderate take where this is addressed.</p>

        <p>I know they’re worse because my family live on north east coast. We’re from there and the winter storms are not only worse, they’re now deadly because people now they’re so severe that everyone loses electricity/power. Various members of my family have had to buy generators to combat this. This never, ever happened, not even once, when I was growing up or a younger adult. Now it is pretty much an annual occurrence. My sister and her family had to live in their dining room in recent winters where they have a fireplace to survive winters in recent years.</p>

        <p>Yes but what’s causing it and wether it can be stopped are the real questions. It can’t and it happens naturally anyway. We might be speeding it up but we have no real way of knowing for sure. All we know is the climate is changing as it has done for the last however many hundreds of millions or billions of years. We jus happen to be alive at a point when it’s happening although the process is very long an we won’t be alive when it’s finished. We’re overdue an ice age anyway so what do you honestly expect. Ice age cometh, there’s literally nothing anyone can do about it. </p>

        <p>The real issue is the corporatocracy doesn’t want to change its ways and make less money. They don’t want government regulations to counteract the effects of climate change. It’s all about money. It’s all about the corporations and corporate owners of course. They want unlimited access to money and if they destroy the environment in the making of it they don’t really care. They are the ones that have programmed you into thinking that climate change isn’t real.</p>

        <p>climatologically speaking, we should be in an era of cooling rather than warming. Humanity has managed to completely reverse the naturally occuring climate change within a little more than a century. That is backed by lot's of data going back way into the past millenium. anthropological climate change is a scientific fact. there is no doubt about it. There are however lots of people that benefit financially from ignoring those facts, because short term financial gains at the cost of our environment are much more powerful than the climate hellscape our children or grand children will have to live in. It is human nature unfortunately. Noone would plant a tree now so that 2 generations later, a kid could sit in it's shade because we don't immediately benefit from it.</p>

        <p>I get skepticism, but not on climate change. 
It makes no sense why every scientist would be lying about climate change. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Russia are completely reliant on oil. Who benefits from convincing the world that fossil fuels are damaging it? Now who benefits from convincing the world that they aren't?</p>

        <p>and the fossil fuel lobby is so benevolent and do not profit in the BILLIONS because they fund "research" that disproves all the geological data that anthropogenic climate change is real. </p>
<p>Like geologically we should actually be in a cool down phase, but instead, humanity managed in a brink of thetime frame it takes for actual climate to change trajectory, to heat up this fucking ball to the point were it is getting more and more difficult to do anything against that...only because RIGHT now there are actual people already massively profiting of you NOT believing in anthropogenic climate change (that is still a fact no matter how much you believe otherwise.

        <p>so how is your geology degree going? </p>
<p>Looking at it from the outside and seeing the absolute majority of scientists agreeing with a proposed hypothesis and only a few whos funding can be traced back to certain lobbyists (great thing about science? Transparency) disagreeing? Not a good look for the deniers. Then again, I don't really understand how a normal person can actually be so strongly in favor of anthropogenic climate change not being real. Do you need to tell yourself that to sleep better at night? what do you have to gain by supporting corporations, that are destroying our atmosphere and planet? I mean even if anthropogenic climate change WEREN'T real... why are you on the side of people that throw toxic waste in rivers, pollute the atmosphere (fact!) and have been caught in scandal after scandal of hiding their most egregious crimes againts the environment? Tell me why?</p>

        <p>I brought this up with my brother in law and he said I've been lucky. OK - so me and everyone I've spoken to about this are all just unusually lucky that no-one we know has been very sick or died over the last year and a half. I asked him if he knows anyone. In response he asked me if I had any relatives in a nursing home. My sister got all upset and said and if we didn't do lockdown you would know people. Always dodging the pointed questions these people.</p>
<p>When the real world evidence doesn't line up with what you hear about the news and online echo chambers maybe "luck" has nothing to do with it.</p>

        <p>You and everyone you know is still a very small sample size. I'm a doctor in Australia, it is real. Are there legitimate grievances? Of course? Was every single lockdown measure necessary? Open to discussion. But to say it's a not real because you haven't seen it is like saying Ebola or Zika isn't real, because you don't live in SSA</p>

        <p>You might not know. But someone’s taking care of a COVID patient on a ventilator right now lol. Down the hall from me. Your argument, “I haven’t seen existential evidence of COVID firsthand, so I don’t believe it exists” is the definition of anecdotal. </p>
<p>In my country of origin, Ecuador, I know a family that had to set the remains of a loved one on the sidewalk outside their homes, because the morgues were completely full. Unless you could pay for private funeral services, that’s where they stayed for days.</p>

        <p>They’re asking you to put a piece of paper over your mouth. You and I have different definitions of global tyranny lmao. </p>
<p>And nope, this hospital does not have a lot of flu patients. I’m not gonna look up every patient, but we have three covid patients on the floor, none with influenza. If you look at the data, this is one of the best (least bad) flu seasons in recorded history. Almost like something we’ve been doing limits the spread of respiratory diseases... hmmm.... 🧐</p>

        <p>There’s a correlation between mask mandate adherence and lockdowns being lifted, because there’s a correlation between mask mandate adherence and new cases. They’re two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Masks are the only measure currently being imposed on me, and it’s not even really imposed a lot of people walk around with no mask. Businesses are all open, as usual. </p>
<p>At the end of the day you missed my main point, which is the measures that have been taken during COVID are not that extreme, in general. After all, it’s largely the same population that complained about mask mandate, then lockdown, then vaccinations. And of course, big surprise, this divisive issue is pretty much entirely bipartisan.</p>

        <p>My country is still in full blown lockdown. The lockdown is administered at the provincial level while mask mandates are local - they are not directly connected. I am glad that you are mostly free from tyrannical lockdowns - but we are not all Americans. </p>
<p>COVID lockdowns are extreme. Deaths due to despair are at an all-time high, small businesses are dropping like flies and I have been locked out of three funerals for close loved ones. All this despite little evidence that lockdowns work. Sweden never locked down. Florida banned COVID lockdowns in September 2020. Both of these regions are doing comparable to neighboring communities. </p>
<p>How many lives need to be ruined before you reconsider these draconian lockdown orders?</p>

        <p>First off, really sorry for what you’re going through, and about the loss of your loved ones. I didn’t mean to sound callous towards people still really suffering, and on rereading myself that’s how I came across. </p>
<p>I would say, though, that a lot of those issues are governments failing to step up and support average people during the lockdown. Corporations got billions while avg Americans received a couple of checks that, in high CoL areas, were pretty meaningless. Especially for larger families, those with additional medical expenses, etc. Same goes for people suffering from depression and committing suicide. The lockdown has highlighted the fact that medical healthcare systems largely suck. It’s highlighted the fact that many don’t make a livable wage, and that many have little or no savings because of this. </p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of hate in this thread being targeted towards medical/scientific community. Frankly, they have no input in how any of these issues are addressed by governments. </p>
<p>I’m not going to pretend I can speak on mandates and political system of your government. I most likely don’t have a clue how things are over there. </p>
<p>My comment was specifically targeted at people implying that, since this is basically the flu, regulations are “imposing global tyranny”...obviously this tyranny isn’t global if I’m not experiencing any. I’m sure many people are currently experiencing tyranny, but I would wager many saying they are, especially in the states, are being hyperbolic. </p>
<p>I haven’t seen someone forced into anything more than a minor inconvenience here, which is why I phrased it a little reductively. I obviously know that the mask mandate isn’t the only problem people are facing. But, to your original reply, there are people in this very post protesting masks. Which kind of belittles people facing actual hardship due to lockdown, like you are.</p>

        <p>I agree, I don’t think masks do anything, but I think the government (at least in Canada) has the authority to impose a mask mandate. All of the other restrictions violate our Constitutional rights.</p>

        <p>I’m calling BS on this. Show a photo of this or it’s not real. I’m in Mexico and there’s been zero sign of that anywhere. Outside of the cities, no one actually believes in Covid; no one wears a mask, and no one social distances or stays in their home. It is pretty much as if Covid doesn’t exist. Because it doesn’t. In the countryside, where nobody wears a mask or social distances, no one is sick, and everybody knows everybody, so everyone knows that it’s not real, thus no one‘s afraid. Only in the cities, where there’s a lot of programming about Covid, and more international visitors, can they get away with pretending that there’s a pandemic. I’m not gonna argue that no one has gotten pneumonia or a respiratory illness as a result of this last year‘s flu. But that happens every year, it’s just that every other year they don’t call it Covid, they call it pneumonia or respiratory illness.</p>

        <p>They’ve been calling it COVID for coming on two years now. Why does the burden have to be on me man? Use your resources and google “ecuador covid pandemic” the first several images are all what I’m talking about. </p>
<p>I’ve never said COVID is everywhere. There’s many places in the states, and Ecuador, and Mexico, that aren’t being affected. Judging from your comment, most of your experiences are from a rural part of Mexico. Rural areas are way less prone to the spread of infectious disease because of population density. If no one is sick, it’s because very few people live in that area relative to cities. This is true pretty much globally, for most diseases. It’s not programming (lol) it’s population density + a respiratory disease. They’re all highly contagious. You guys have more room. </p>
<p>And if you’re arguing whether there’s a novel pathogen that’s different from pneumonia and influenza, with different symptoms and is not treatable in the same way... you’re just arguing biological fact. Influenza meds don’t work on COVID patients. Antibiotics don’t work on COVID patients because it’s not bacterial, it’s viral. I’m very happy to hear that no one in your community is sick, because for rural communities, treatment options are limited because these meds just don’t work.</p>

        <p>And the US slaughtered dozens of teenagers on a college lawn (Kent State), planned to terrorize its own citizens in order to blame it on Cuba to start a war (Operation Northwoods), terrorized its own citizens in order to start a war with Spain (USS Maine), performed countless experiments on its own citizens (Tuskegee, MK Ultra), and funded gender studies in Pakistan (it's in the "Covid Relief" bill).</p>
<p>I know that's a lot to take in so you'll just ignore it all and continue to act like politicians <em>love</em> you. In fact, they love you so fucking much they want to inject you with a magnet so they can attach themselves to you.

        <p>Sure everything you say may be true, tbh I’m not knowledgeable enough on the subject to disagree.</p>
<p>My point however was when it comes to pandemics I will trust the research behind the vaccines and take them. Remember most of the vaccines weren’t even American companies (except for J&amp;J but those aren’t circulated currently I believe)</p>
<p>Also if you knew anything about magnets you’d know the whole magnetization of your skin is bullshit lol. Otherwise let’s pretend it was real, it’s clump up in your bloodstream due to polarized magnets attracting/repelling one another and many people would be experiencing heart attacks / strokes.</p>

        <p>And? Were you upset about the atomic bombing of Japan? That was like 0.01% of the world pop. How about 9-11? That was like 0.0001% of the world pop, and that’s counting all the people who were injured but survived. These were big deals, yeah? </p>
<p>Maybe it’s not so much the actual toll on human life that determines whether we care about a crisis, and moreso politics and media. Imagine after 9-11 someone saying, well, 99.9999% survived. It’s technically the truth but so what?</p>

        <p>Wow dude! You had made two good points, elsewhere, that I read compared to the ignorance about cooperation 10x over but you just shit the bed.</p>
<p>Hiroshima (and Nagasaki) were exactly what needed to happen to end a global conflict that was destroying everyone in multiple dozens of countries.</p>
<p>The exact same Purple Heart Awards given out for decades (into the early 2000's) were made in the 1940's based on the projected numbers of American troops that were needed to hop the islands to end the War in the Pacific while the Japanese were raping, killing and experimenting on everyone they thought inferior. Collectively, most of an entire society had their mindset changed through those 2 bombs.</p>
<p>Honestly, anything you say against this as your example was abhorrent I'm going to disregard. You are an ass. To compare open conflict vs. a bug (That I've had and laughed at as bronchitis) is pathetic and you need a 4 year time out in the library to catch up on world history.</p>
<p>They cannot be compared on simple numbers and you are a bad person for attempting to lump them together. The more I type, the more I realize I'm absolutely done with you and your ignorance.</p>

        <p>Not sure what you’re talking about with ignorance over cooperation. </p>
<p>The bombs saved American military personnel at the cost of mostly civ Japanese; this is not the place for this moral/historical discussion. </p>
<p>As for your third paragraph, I don’t wanna get into it too much for reason I wrote above, but the concept that the majority (or as you said, an entire society) of Japanese people were in support of the war is not a fact. </p>
<p>This next paragraph... listen if you’re gonna insult me at least me it legible. </p>
<p>You missed my entire point after you got triggered by reading a WWII fact. The actual numbers of deaths do not matter to people as much as the sociopolitical factors that contextualize them. </p>
<p>It makes sense that we accepted the deaths of thousands of innocent Japanese (at least that many children, not saying they all were civ or that civs are all innocent) because the alternative was the deaths of thousands of American soldiers. It does NOT make sense to accept the deaths of thousands of elderly, immunocompromised people, because the alternative is a piece of fuckin paper over your nose and mouth. </p>
<p>I literally say it’s not so much the actual toll (as in number of dead). You agree with me on one thing, but you completely missed that because you disagree so passionately about an implied point I made (that the bombings were wrong or something). I never even made that point, because this isn’t the sub for it. All I said were that they were big deals some were upset by. Like, in my opinion, COVID is.</p>

The Japanese knew they wouldn't be able to defeat the combined forces of the Soviets and Americans. It was easier for the Japanese to admit defeat to a super weapon than to a formidable foe.</p>

<p>Occam’s razor. They don’t need to fabricate the existence of a building and then stage its destruction in one of the most populous places on earth. They can just do it for real; the cost of human life and to build the structures, and repair the community after their destruction... these costs are meaningless to the wealthy.</p>

        <p>Cool. I have an OHIP card too. Last year I realized mine was expired for several months, mailed away for a new one. So why do you give a fuck about covid? Anyone that's worried can make the necessary lifestyle improvements to turn that problem into a mere nuisance. Or better yet, take the vaccines that totally work and are totally safe. I presume because you are worried about catching coronavirus you've cleaned up your diet, cut out all processed foods, minimized carbs, maximized meat and lean vegetables, stayed properly hydrated, stopped smoking and drinking and vaping and masturbating and consuming fictional media, got ahold of some dumbbells, been going for a run every morning before you clock in on the Zoom horseshit, shower daily, take Vitamin C and D and Zinc and creatine supplements, have consensual sex with adult partners who are alive and conscious at the time of intercourse on a regular basis, advised everyone you know who's worried about corona to do likewise?</p>

        <p>I'm not worried about catching the virus. I am fully vaccinated, live a healthy lifestyle and am young and live in a country with pretty good living standards already and my living standards are above average I would say anyway (House, huge Garden, Lake and forest in walking disctance, etc.) So I am not afraid of Covid. the probability of me even catching that had been slim because I was careful and the probability of me getting it now are closing in on zero. </p>
<p>So none of your fun assumptions about how healthy I live my live matter in any shape or form. Especially the part about "consensual sex with adult partners who are alive and conscious"...are you alright dude? should I call someone for help What kind of kink necrophilia childrape fantasies do you have?? I am a little worried. That was oddly specific.</p>

        <p>My opinion: this ain’t about a virus this is about the economies “bubble” that should’ve burst back in 2008 but was propped up. They know the economy is going to collapse and soon. But if they can gain control over it and have full or partial control over the collapse then they can ensure they remain in power and still in control etc. </p>
<p>It seems this was the lesser of 2 evils (for them) to some extent. “Collapse the economy to a point where it’s manageable etc and have complete control so they can ensure they still come out on top instead of being buried under the rubble of the collapse so to speak. </p>
<p>Tbh personally tho I think I’d prefer the other option a complete and fresh restart from the ground up. Every corporation and company bust and we have to start again preferably with a modified version of capitalism and socialism or something like that. I dunno I’m not an economist so my knowledge on this subject is obviously very limited. I just know the current system the way it’s built can’t survive and it shouldn’t survive although it seems some powerful, rich “people” are trying their hardest to ensure it does. It’s also about control they want us to be 100% reliant on them the corporations etc for the forseeble future as it means they remain in complete power for ever then. This economy is completely fucked regardless tho and big changes for better or worse will have to come. </p>
<p>If you don’t believe they would go that extent to do this kinda shit then jus remember as I like to point out when people claim they can trust the government; they spent the last 100+ years demonising the most beneficial plant known to man (cannabis/hemp) that could literally save the planet, all because it was a direct threat to a few peoples industry and profit/power, it also holds the potential cure to cancer within it and the government have known it can effectively treat cancer since 1979.</p>

        <p>i am 100% with you on the visible brokenness of the current system. If this pandemic showed us anything than that "essential workers" are what keeps a society going and how we treat those people like shit. And that needs to change. The guy that benefitted most from this is Jeff besoz and funnily enough: This sub is more obsessed with the evil of "Bill gates" or "Jews" or whatever the fuck then they are with the most glaringly obvious benefactor of this crisis. They ramble about their precious freedom while deeeeeply dependend on this one delivery corporation. And noone who considers themselves a non-sheep even mentions it. It's infuriating, really. </p>
<p>But I am no economist either, so this is just from watching it unfold with no understanding of market economy. </p>
<p>Distrust in government, especially a government basically paid for by lobbyists and corporations is a good thing. I just think people are scapegoating and demonizing the wrong people here, thereby playing the exact game those that actually ARE hurting society want them to play.</p>

        <p>How are you being forced to interact with the covid vaccine...? Honest question. Need to travel? Skip the vacation, road trip; private airlines are private. Kid needs to get back into school? Home school or private school. </p>
<p>Based on the logic of “if something can kill... that thing should not be something anyone forcibly has to interact with”, you would have to always wear your mask. Opting out forces people to interact with you and your droplets. COVID or not, droplets can kill. I don’t think anyone’s arguing whether respiratory infections exist. </p>
<p>I forcibly have to interact with assholes on the road while I commute. I don’t have the right to a police escort to work, I just have the right to expect people to take precautions to make it as safe as possible. And you have the right to not take those precautions. But it still makes you an inconsiderate asshole.</p>

        <p>What do you mean they, the virus? The vaccine? I don’t believe anywhere is doing legally mandated vaccination, which why I asked how you’re being “forcibly” made to interact with it. </p>
<p>I get that you think it’s a freedom you’re entitled to. I won’t argue that, I’d say that’s for individuals and the communities they interact w/ to decide for themselves. Not some fuckin politician whose never been to the town, or some doc whose never served any of the patients that live there. BUT, it is not your right to not wear a mask. Rights have a very specific meaning— it’s just what’s in the Bill of rights + it’s amendments. Just a random point that I think leads to misunderstandings.</p>

        <p>So I did some googling on spike proteins. In my studies of microbio, we would refer to them less specifically as glycoproteins. That’s what they are, a protein made of sugar. </p>
<p>Spike just refers to their purpose, which is essentially an anchor protein for the individual virus to grab onto a cell. You can think of it as landing gear for the virus. So let me ask you this, a military combat aircraft is pretty dangerous, right? How about its landing gear? Not so much. A component of something dangerous is not always dangerous. The individual protein itself is harmless in patients that have it due to vaccination. It is harmful during an active infection, which flat out is not a possible result of the vaccine. Remember folks, this is an mRNA vaccine not an attenuated (weakened) version of the virus. You’re not getting the whole aircraft, you’re getting bits and pieces that cannot function without the whole. </p>
<p>I gotta tell you man, even if someone I knew had covid or some other horrible disease, and they deliberately tried to get me sick, I would not shoot them. An eye for an eye leaves the world blind. People getting vaccines are doing it because they think it’s the right thing to do. That you might take a life because they think differently than you is really sad. I would be sad if someone took your life, and you think very differently than me. I hope you have a nice day, man.</p>

        <p>The landing gear is still harmless, that’s gravity making it dangerous. </p>
<p>If you inject a vaccine with a dirty needle, you’ll probably get sick. Doesn’t make the vaccine dangerous. If you eat some undercooked meat you could get a nasty parasite. Doesn’t make meat dangerous. </p>

        <p>So you are claiming that everyone that got sick after, used a dirty needle and ate bad meat? You just invented facts out of nothing..... It's also fallacious, and imagine if I substitute the word heroin in your example... It's also ironic you say I'm finding reason to be scared of anything when it's literally the opposite. I'm so unafraid of covid I'm able to objectively consider risks on both things. Are you able to consider risks of the vaccine? Cause if you say there are none, you deny science from CDC and WHO.... Those risks may be small, but they exist.</p>

<p>No one has died from the covid vaccine. People have died since they got it, but even if every single person who has died since getting it (remember they started with old people in many places) was because of the shot, it’s still 1/1000th as deadly. </p>
<p>0.0017% from the shot (none of these people were from the shot according to docs, take that as you will but no way all of them are from the shot, accidents happen) </p>
<p>2% from the virus. And that’s 2% dead, a lot of younger people get fucked up bad and then pull through.</p>

        <p>Your numbers are off, it's not 2% from the virus. I like where this is headed though, let's bring out real numbers and talk about risk calculations for different people. Let's also talk about the study that shows a recovered person likely has lifetime T cell immunity, cross reactive to whole families of similar viruses (which checks with everything we previously knew about immune systems) meaning that the recovered likely gain no benefit from the jab, and let's see where pushing recovered people to get a jab falls in the risk calculations...</p>

        <p>2% mortality rate from COVID in the US, not 2% of the pop. If you get it you have a roughly 2% chance, on average, of dying. This varies from state to state obviously. Just an example. This is based on latest number of covid deaths/number of cases. About 1.8% but a lot of people likely died before we started testing and some covid deaths were not so covid related. So who knows what the real numbers are. Either way it’s orders of magnitudes different, even counting every death as from the vaccine. </p>
<p>These are real numbers lol post some of your own, or maybe a link to a scholarly article with the longitudinal T cell data we would need to back up that claim...</p>

        <p>I did not say your numbers were fake, I said it was inaccurate. Also, if you were giving a number for something different, then why did you vote the exact number for just the US, instead of the number for the place you were referring to? Also, India is a bad choice for your example since neither the US not India break the top 20 for deaths for capita.

        <p>Ah I forgot you NEED that trip to FL, Karen. </p>
<p>I’ll give you this, the school situation is unique because kids need to go. Parents often can’t get child care during the day, and are unable to homeschool because they work. But you can’t get mad a public institution undergoes government regulation. </p>
<p>A public school system good for all kids where everyone is happy... that’s just not gonna happen. Ultimately, I wouldn’t want my kid to be vaccinated. Yet as of May 17th nowhere in the US has state mandated covid shots for public schools. So you do have options. Yet here you are, telling people to fuck off.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Another bullshit red flag: you're told to get the vaccine, not talk to your doctor about if it's right for your health at this time. Steamrolling policy.</p>
<p>The other meme brings up an awesome point: who are all these people that are testing positive if essentially all that's left are the non-vaccinated people who aren't getting tested because they see the psy-op...?</p>

<p>Anecdotal evidence, I know. But the ideea that a healthy body can not be harmed by disease is a myth and a lie. sure it can reduce risk. a smoker will definitely be affected much more severly by a pneumonia than a non-smoker... but the idea that a healthy body is immune to disease is just biologically impossible. </p>

        <p>Nick Cordero the Broadway actor? Fuck outta here g. That demographic is notorious for drug abuse and promiscuous sexual behaviour. I got $100 says he had AIDS and hepatitis and chlamydia and collapsed veins and who the fuck knows what else ravaging his body before he caught a common flu bug my friend. Amazing how after over a year of a global deadly disease pandemic the biggest name you could conjure up who died of coronavirus is some guy only homosexuals and fat women have even heard of - in a real pandemic there would be a grocery list of dead celebrities and politicians. "Oh but Trump got it", Trump is a fat slob who literally doesn't believe in exercise and sleeps 3 hours a night because he can't help himself shitposting on Twitter at 4am in the morning every single day. And even he was fine. If corona was a real threat he would be dead - trust me bro in the early weeks when I was still scared of corona I considered that and its attendant instability a serious threat.</p>

        <p>Trump was fucking POTUS at the time he got sick. he was piss poor at his job but that doesn't change the fact that he had the BEST FUCKING medical care the world can provide. If he had been sick being just "Trump", the fat fuck would have had much more complications. </p>
<p>And I am pretty sure, Amanda Kloots, the Widow of Nick Cordero, would have a few things to say about the disgustingly aweful things you just MADE UP about her late husband, just because you want to own a random stranger on the internet. It's just sick what lengths you have to go to for that. </p>
<p>Nick Cordero was a healthy man, loving husband and father. I bet $10000 bucks he had neither HIV nor any of the STDs you would love for him to have so that he is not an excampe of a healthy man dying from Covid because you can't accept that that happens.</p>

        <p>and there are far EASIER ways to reduce emission thant to force people to stay at home. It's just that the fossil fuel lobbyists would be very much against those measures. So they will make sure that we have to suffer the consequences of their actions. If you are against climate lockdowns, maybe show those fossil fuel corporations that they won't be getting away with that shit.</p>

<p>I watched a Mein Kampf documentary recently. Those Germans that actually read the book were appalled, but most Germans never actually read the book and just "went with it". Then when the war ended they started asking how could Hitler have gotten into power and they never knew what Hitler would've done with the Jews.</p>

        <p>The key to achieving such a mandate is to terrify the masses by exaggeration and blatant fear mongering.  Add a year of economic uncertainty and impose a concurrent psychological game mandating ineffectual protocols including wearing of masks and a good number would be willing to do anything to have those things go away- including participation in a global medical experiment.</p>

        <p>It’s not tyrannical? Don’t know what your issue is with the US government or whatever but other countries have been doing just fine when they followed the rules put into place, we had a few cases here in Australia and we went into lockdown with masks again. It’s been almost 2 weeks and we’re coming out of lockdown tomorrow. If you handled it appropriately from the beginning and there weren’t people ‘braver’ than everyone else, it would be a much smaller problem.</p>

        <p>Alright. First the death rate is around 2 to 3 percent.</p>
<p>Next, if there were no masks. No lockdown, US Cases would be around 20 million.</p>

        <p>Yes. It could be higher, it could be lower, but that’s a much more accurate estimate than 2-3%.</p>
<p>If the death rate was 3%, there would be over 3 million Americans who have died to COVID, according to CDC infected estimates https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html</p>

        <p>Does it really? I mean, the death rate is like 2% globally I think. Or somewhere around there. Millions have died, regardless of the actual %. So, at how many dead does the point crumble?</p>

        <p>Percentages are ALWAYS relative. Yes, it sucks that millions of people died worldwide, but no mortality rate is high enough to give unlimited power to the government.</p>
<p>That 10% figure you provided is of the people that died. So roughly 200k people out of 2 million were coronavirus deaths. And again, the only people who died were those who would be knocked out by the annual flu or a common cold. The vast majority of people recover quickly </p>

        <p>600,000 have already died in USA which is 0.18% of the population, which means a 0.1% death rate is impossible.  However, 0.18% is just a minimum, as that death rate would only be possible if none of the unexplained excess deaths are related to covid, everysingle person in USA has already had covid (less people having it shrinks the denominator which actually increases the death rate mathematically) and nobody else will die from it.   All three of these are almost certainly not true, and therefore the death rate is almost certainly much higher than even 0.18%, meaning this meme of a 0.1% death rate is a just a lying piece of trash.  Sorry dude, you're allowed to have a stupid opinion, but you're not entitled to your own facts.  The facts simply do not support this false information.</p>

        <p>nobody needs CNN (or Faux News for that matter) to inform themselves about the probability of false positives in RT-PCR tests. That shit is publically available on the internet. you can look it up yourself. so don't believe what your fake news outlets are telling you. look it up yourself. Copy pasting other peoples opinions on it is not going to convince me. Studies will, facts will. peer reviewed sources will.</p>

        <p>can you point me to data of a flu season in the USA that cost 150.000 lives in one season? Oh wait. don' bother. I looked at the numbers and no flu season in recent years had that many casualties. one bad flu season, like the one in 2017 cost 61.000 lives. Sure, the spanish flu, the last big pandemic, cost around 50 million but that came along with mask mandates, quarantine, etc as well. </p>
<p>What you are talking about are annual flu deaths WORLDWIDE. WORLDWIDE Covid has already cost 3.81 MILLION people their lives.</p>
<p>So just look up the shit you are talking about before you talk out of your ass, like a moron.</p>

        <p>They won’t get to spend time with their grandchildren, since child and teen suicides have skyrocketed since the lockdowns. Not to mention drug overdoses. <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/science/the-5th-largest-school-district-in-the-us-announced-a-plan-to-phase-back-into-in-person-learning-after-a-rise-in-student-suicides/ar-BB1d3HbI">One school district in Las Vegas had 18 child/teen suicides 9 months</a>, forcing them to finally reopen schools. It’s sick.  </p>
<p>And wouldn’t you know, the CDC doesn’t have suicide data listed for 2020 yet, because “it takes time to compile” despite the fact that we have nearly minute by minute tickers updated us with the number of not only deaths from Covid, but mere infections.</p>
